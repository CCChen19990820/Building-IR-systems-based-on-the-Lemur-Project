<h2>Cigarettes and Aliens in Washington
</h2>
<P>

There's a new movie out this week, appropriately named "Independence Day."  In Washington, this movie is so hot, they are running a 4 a.m. showing at the Uptown Theater and even that is sold out.  "Independence Day" is about aliens who take over and eventually destroy the White House.  The world is next on their agenda.<P>
The trouble is, the movie is about three years too late.  The aliens have occupied the White House since George Bush left in 1993.  No plot from Hollywood could possibly come close to what we already have with these diabolical aliens.  There's the First Lady who doesn't remember making a call from Arkansas the night lawyer Vince Foster mysteriously died.  There's the Vice President who advocates a new world order run by environmentalists.  There's the president who tells one group he's pro-life and then supports the practice of partial birth abortions.  This is the White House that ordered FBI summary files on its political enemies.  These are the aliens who brought us Whitewater, travel-gate and "I feel your pain."<P>
Let's just say I'm glad I'm not running the President's reelection campaign.  His party has their hands full trying to contain a candidate who has begun to hemorrhage in the polls.<P>
Perhaps the Democratic party has found a way out.  They recently discovered what they are sure will be a scandal against Republican opponent Bob Dole.  The scandal they have begun to stoke is cigarettes.  It seems Bob Dole used to smoke cigarettes. Unlike the President, Mr. Dole admits that he actually inhaled.  The Democrats are so certain they have a marketable scandal against Dole, they've even hired an actor to follow the Dole campaign.  Each morning the actor dresses himself as a seven-foot cigarette.  The actor who portrays this giant cigarette calls himself "Butt Man."  The idea is that Mr. Dole is somehow villainous because his campaign has received money from cigarette conglomerates.  What's worse, Mr. Dole won't even say he's sorry.<P>
The Democratic National Committee says it is proud of "Butt Man."  What else can they talk about?  After all, Dole is about as scandalous as Socks the Cat-and we're told Socks even counts mice among his friends.<P>
"Butt Man" probably won't be coming to a town near you.  Certainly "Independence Day" will soon be playing at theater near you.  If you go to see it, remember to follow these simple rules of theater etiquette.  First, don't talk when the movie begins, that irritates other viewers. Second, don't laugh when you see the White House blow up, it really isn't funny. And finally, whatever you do, don't smoke. The real aliens just might attack you, in the press.<P>

<h2>The Establishment is Having a Fit</h2>
<P>

<P>
                      Establishment Republicans across the country are upset at the rising influencing of
                      anti-establishment Conservatives in their party. These party professionals have drawn
                      quiet sympathy from their Democratic counterparts who share their disdain over the
                      revolutionary voices of an anti-Washington public threatening the status quo of the
                      cozy two-party system.
<P>
                      In Kansas, the establishment has quietly criticized Sam Brownback, a conservative
                      freshman Congressman, because he is running for Bob Dole's vacated Senate seat.
                      The Republican establishment has chosen a liberal to fill the seat, and view
                      Brownback as a threat to the carefully-crafted status quo.
<P>
                      In South Carolina, eleven Christian conservatives outpaced former Governor Carroll
                      Campbell this Spring in the voting for the state's delegates to the National Convention.
                      Campbell was furious that unknowns would challenge the establishment. "I play in a
                      much bigger league than they do," Campbell later told reporters. "I don't have time to
                      fool with them."
<P>
                      All of this intolerance towards anti-establishment conservatives is masked in official
                      calls for tolerance toward liberals in the Republican party. The center of gravity in
                      today's political debate is the culture. The issue most symbolic of the cultural debate is
                      abortion. It is for this reason that the establishment insists on language of tolerance
                      only in the abortion plank.
<P>                      At the same time, no such call for tolerance is leveled against the Democratic
                      Platform. Look at the language of the two platforms: the Republican plank actually
                      says little about abortion and weakly calls for a human life amendment which would
                      have no guarantee of saving unborn lives. The Democratic Party Plank strongly asserts
                      the practice of abortion on demand and even calls for a national law to enforce the
                      practice. Again, not one word is offered to suggest Democrats should adopt changes
                      in their pro-abortion plank, not even words of tolerance.

                      While the two parties continue to apply a double meaning to the term "tolerance," a
                      vast group of Americans have begun to rethink their support for the Republican Party.
                      In fact, the day is coming when ordinary American voters will no longer be able to tell
                      the two parties apart. When that happens, it is likely that a new, anti-establishment
                      party will arise, fueled by a public outraged at being ignored by both Republicans and
                      Democrats.

                      You see the real debate this year is much larger than opposing platforms. The real
                      contest this year is no longer between Republicans and Democrats. It is a contest
                      which pits Washington against its own citizens. Let's be honest about one thing: the
                      Republican and Democratic parties are both pretty much run by professional
                      politicians. It is this same establishment that long ago took Washington into captivity,
                      controlling the media, lobbying for special interests

<h2>When Whitewater Wasn't Cool
</h2>
<P>

There is an old country song which goes, "I was country, when country wasn't cool."  Like the song, there was a time when Whitewater, as a news story, wasn't cool.  Now that Special Counsel Ken Starr has secured actual jury convictions, and now that Attorney General Janet Reno has added "Filegate" to Starr's portfolio, Starr and Whitewater enjoy generally-accepted credibility.<P>
Today Whitewater is cool.  But I remember the days when Whitewater wasn't cool.  I recall 1994, when Washington Times investigative reporter Jerry Seper uncovered factual Whitewater information on an almost daily basis. On Whitewater, Seper spent weeks meticulously fitting together the factual pieces of a puzzle scattered over a ten year period, strewn across Arkansas and Washington, DC, and overlooked by establishment reporters who sat on the facts because Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>
At the same time, NET-television network began a weekly "Whitewater Update" on "Capitol Watch."  NET tried to get the painfully uncompromising Mr. Seper on our program, but found him routinely unavailable for the limelight. Fortunately, we managed convince several of his colleagues to help us present to our live call-in audience the factual details known at the time.  Editorial Page Editor Tod Lindberg, editorial writer Eric Felton, and even Wesley Pruden helped NET interpret the latest facts in a case which was, for other networks, too difficult for the nightly news.  Indeed, Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>
Talk radio played a hand back then. The Seper and Times reports were reliable talking points for an audience trapped between a media establishment trying to avoid Whitewater as a story and hucksters trying to exploit Whitewater for profit.  Even then much of the public new there was a story amidst the confusion.  Whitewater was a story which simply wouldn't go away.<P>
Whitewater wasn't cool then, but it became fashionable later.  As the 104th Congress began its hearings and Special Counsel Starr took over the investigation, gradually the story began to achieve its acceptance.  Seper continued his work. The editorial page added its perspective for readers of the new National Weekly edition and for Insight magazine.  Talk radio and NET continued to take calls.<P>
Finally Starr's work produced its first indictments – former business partners of the First Lady, Susan and James McDougal, and the Governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker. Conventional wisdom said the Governor and Susan McDougal would win acquittals partly because the Little Rock jury had not been sequestered and names of the jurists were published in the local papers.  Yet, Starr's efforts prevailed and the jury convicted each of the defendants.  Thus, Whitewater became "cool."<P>
Today Whitewater and its cousins, "Filegate" and "Travelgate," have become the story of the year.  Today a pool of reporters have jumped into the cool current of Whitewater.  They go to bed with visions of Pulitzer dancing in their heads. Few may realize they have a story built on the foundation of work quietly produced by the likes of Jerry Seper. To the readers of the Washington Times, the listeners of talk radio, and the viewers of NET, Whitewater was always a story.  We were Whitewater when Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>

<h2>The Communists are Going to Lose
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>



It appears to me that the Communists are about to lose the elections in   

Russia.  I say this because I have watched elections in which they have   

participated in for over 35 years.  Absolutely every time they think they   

are going to lose they begin to complain that the election process is   

rigged with fraud ahead of time.  Well that is happening now with a   

vengeance as the Communists hope to discredit any victory by Russian   

President Boris Yeltsin.<P>

Yeltsin, for his part, has been running very tough television commercials   

narrated by famous Russian actors calling to mind the days of terror   

inflicted on the Russian people by Stalin, the times of famine due to the   

Communist system, the lack of freedom to travel and worship and so on.<P>   

The pro Yeltsin narrators say of Gennady Zuganov, the Communist candidate   

for President, that the Communists now claim that they are different than   

those of old but, in fact, they are not. These American style television   

commercials have a point. While Zuganov tones down his views when he is   

speaking to Western reporters, out on the hustings when speaking to the   

party faithful he doesn't hesitate to invoke the name of Stalin and he   

makes no apologies for the Communist era which he said brought Russians   

stability.<P>

One aspect of the Russian campaign which has interesting implications is   

the effort by Boris Yeltsin's newfound electoral partner Alexander Lebed   

to denounce aspects of Western culture.  Since the fall of the Soviet   

Union in l99l, Russia has been invaded by American soap operas, American   

pornographic magazines, American R and X rated movies, American punk   

fashions and contemporary American morals.  Lebed, while somewhat friendly   

to the West politically, has denounced this trashy Western influence on   

the Russian culture and has promised that , if continued in power, he   

will do his best to rid the nation of such corrupting elements.  Lebed   

placed a strong third in the first round of the Russian elections and   

Yeltsin hired him as his security chief the next day.  Lebed has been more   

visible than Yeltsin this past week as the campaign heads to July 3rd for   

the final round.<P>

It will be interesting to see if the Russian voters respond to Lebed's   

promise to rid Russia of the degrading aspects of Western culture.  If   

they do, American politicians might take note.  While this country would   

not respond well to the authoritarian suggestions of Lebed, I think the   

climate is right for a political figure to finally have the courage to   

say "enough is enough" when it comes to the ever degrading television   

shows, movies and printed material that constantly flows forth these   

days.  There are still enough people who adhere to the Judeo Christian   

moral structure in this country to make a mighty difference if any   

credible political figure would tell them what they are anxiously waiting   

to hear. <P>

<h2>Second Thoughts About a Constitutional Convention
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>


I am about to upset a lot of people. So get your pens ready, crank up your computers, and oil your fax machines. Here we go. <P>
I am sitting here thinking about another dreadful Supreme Court decision, the 7 to 1 rendering on the VMI case which outlaws same sex educational institutions. It paves the way for women in combat and a host of other things we have fought over the years. It continues what my colleague Tom Jipping has called "the cultural Jihad." <P>
I, of course, have called for the impeachment of the majority on this court, although I know how far that will get. Still, the question is, as Lenin once said, "What is to be done?" <P>
If you watched Direct Line Wednesday night you understand that Congress will do nothing about this decision. There are constitutional remedies available to the Congress, such as withdrawing jurisdiction from the Court on certain issues, but they never, ever use them. Let’s face it, after more than fifty years of watching the Court erode its power, the Congress is afraid to do anything about it. <P>
I keep thinking of what the Court has done to votes of the people such as in the Colorado homosexual rights case and in the Arkansas term limits case and on and on. I will bet that had the people in Virginia voted on VMI or the people of South Carolina voted on the Citadel they would have voted to uphold tradition. It is clear that with this Court the votes of the people don’t matter. <P>
This Court keeps altering the Constitution to the point where it can no longer be recognized. They find rights which are not there. They do not respect, in any way, the 10th Amendment which reserves to the states and to the people those matters which are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. <P>
The argument against a Constitutional Convention is that it would change our constitutional form of government. But our form of government is being changed by this Supreme Court case by case, year by year. The Court does so without the consent of the governed or even of the Congress elected by the governed. With this Court there is no Constitution unless it is found convenient to resurrect it from time to time. <P>
I know this is going to send my friend Phyllis Schlafly into orbit and I will be forever branded as a traitor to my country by various committees of correspondence who busy the fax machines and the Internet. But I have to ask the question. Can we be worse off with a Constitutional Convention elected by the people than we are with a Court that constantly undoes the work of the people? <P>
I guess I have more faith in the people than others do. I recall that the same fears which have been expressed about a national Constitutional Convention were expressed about both Maryland and Louisiana when they held such conventions to rewrite their state constitutions. No real damage was done in Maryland, despite it being one of the most liberal states in the country. Louisiana’s constitution came out far better after the convention than before. <P>
If my good friends at the NRA, the Christian Coalition, in pro-life groups, and a host of other groups can help win elections all around the country, why can’t they help elect a majority to a Constitutional Convention? If we ran slates of delegates to such a convention on a reform ticket which included items such as term limits and a real balanced budget amendment with tax limitation and so on, I’ll bet we would win a majority of the convention hands down. Maybe then we could change the Constitution to protect the unborn, insure that citizens have their rights restored on issues such as Amendment Two in Colorado, insure that the court cannot repeal human nature as they have tried to do in the VMI case, and so on.
It is true that we could lose the elections to such a convention. That is always the chance you take when the people vote. But what is the alternative? At least such a Convention would be acting on a vote of the people. The way things stand, our way of life, our Constitution, our culture, our system of government are all being changed by a Court which is responsible to no one. Do we sit here and let it happen? Or do we try to take back our country? My colleague Bill Lind wants a new political party. Well and good, but what will that accomplish if this Court takes all of our rights away in the meanwhile? <P>
Let me make something clear. I revere the work of the Founding Fathers. I think the Constitution they produced has a near sacred quality to it. I believe it produced the best government the world has seen for a century and a half. Remember that these same Founding Fathers provided for the very Constitutional Convention we are discussing. <P>
But let’s face it, the era when the Constitution was respected by the Supreme Court has long been over. Several Republican Presidents have tried to appoint so called "strict constructionists" to the court to reverse what has been happening since the New Deal. It hasn’t worked. The majority in the VMI case were Republican appointees. <P>
It seems to me that we have to face reality. I want the opponents of a Constitutional Convention to make the case to me that we are better off letting this runaway Court strip us of our heritage on a systematic basis, than we would be if the people had a chance to elect a convention that could express their will.
I think a national election for a convention would be a very serious affair. I’ll bet it would be treated that way by the voters and it would be a remarkable opportunity to educate people about what our constitutional form of government should be. I’m sorry, but I can’t accept the view that we should do nothing. We mourn and we complain and we express regret at what is happening but we do nothing.
I say it is hard for me to imagine that we would be worse off than we are now with a vote of the same people who passed term limits, voted for Amendment Two in Colorado, voted for three strikes and you’re out in California, and so on. <P>
Go ahead. Come at me. Let’s debate this proposition. It sure is better than sitting around and ringing our hands. <P>

<h2>Clinton Dodges Another Scandal
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>







It is always nice to have friends on the Supreme Court. Bill Clinton had at least four of them which is why he won't be giving depositions this Summer in the Paul Jones sexual harassment suit. The court agreed to take up the question of whether or not a President can face a civil suit during his term in office. Now the court will decide in l997 if the decision by the court of appeals that the lawsuit may proceed is valid. Had the High court simply upheld the decision of the appeals court, the law suit would have gone ahead. <P>

But then we shouldn't be surprised. Bill Clinton's entire history is one of close calls and of voters giving him the benefit of the doubt. And it appears they are about to do so again.<P>

Of all the data I have reviewed on elections, which began with a tutorial the pollster Richard Wirthlin gave me in l970 right after then California Governor Ronald Reagan's re-election, I must say I consider some of the recent findings most remarkable.<P>

The public does understand that President Clinton is less than honest. The public believes that the White House is not telling the truth on filegate. The public believes that Hillary Clinton is lying. The public thinks that Bill Clinton is not a good role model for children. The public thinks that the Clintons have covered up their role in Whitewater. But the public says they want Bill Clinton to be President anyway.<P>

Because I rise at 4:30 every morning, I seldom watch the late night TV shows. But I didn't have to get up Saturday morning so I tuned in for a change. Non stop jokes about Bill and Hillary. Jokes about the President dating while in office. Jokes about the President's friends serving time in prison. Lots of jokes about the First Lady, and that was before the revelations about her conversations with long dead political figures. For example, in comparing music to politics, Jay Leno said that in music Dolly Parton does 9 to 5. But in politics Hillary Clinton will be doing 5 to 9. And so it goes, I am told, night after night and the audience cheers, yet they continue to favor the President's re-election. <P>

What gives here? How could voters believe someone is dishonest, has become a sort of national joke, and yet is favored to win in November.<P>

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson thinks the problem is that the media has so devalued the Presidency that voters now believe it doesn't matter who we present as our leader to the rest of the world. Author Kevin Phillips believes that the voters are so cynical, since they believe all politicians are dishonest, that they simply are inclined to be with the devil they know rather than the devil they don't know.<P>

I think there is a third factor at work. When you quiz voters about why they favor Bill Clinton's re-election, they will tell you that he understands their problems more than his rivals. Others will say he will do more for them than his opponents. I think what we have here is the ultimate conclusion of the "me generation". Bill Clinton is the defender of the status quo as far as government benefits are concerned. So voters are saying "I know this President is dishonest, but what the heck. He'll see to it I don't get hit too hard, so I'm going to support him and frankly I don't care what happens to the rest of the country." <P>

I think back to the young man who asked the l992 Presidential candidates at one of the debates how they were going to take care of him. Instead of telling the kid to go take care of himself, the candidates all fell over themselves telling him what they were going to do for him, but Bill Clinton gave him the most sympathetic answer. <P>

I think my driver John Blackwell, who also drives a taxi part-time in Washington and thus is in touch with the real world, has the right answer. Blackwell points out that over half of the population is now dependent on a government check of one kind or another. "The voters are just looking at their own pockets and thinking that Bill Clinton will keep their checks coming", Blackwell said. I am afraid he is right. <P>

It worked in Roman times. Bread and circuses kept the population happy as their freedoms were taken away. The public doesn't want to face the bad news that we are going bankrupt as a nation. That our debt is robbing us and especially our children and grandchildren blind. In a few more years, there simply won't be any money at all to pay the bills. But, hey, that's after Bill Clinton leaves office after his second term. Why should we worry? <P>

<h2>Hillary Talks to the Dead?
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>



According to Bob Woodward's new book "The Choice", Hillary Clinton held an imaginary conversation with the late First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who died in l962. <P>

      Talking to Eleanor was the brainchild of Jean Houston, the Co-Director of the Foundation for Mind Research. <P>

      Now, of course, I wasn't present for that conversation between Hillary and Eleanor, but I can well imagine how it went. <P>

       "Oh, Eleanor", said Hillary," You just can't imagine what it is like being married to a man who almost never tells the truth". Replied Eleanor : "Come, come dear. I know exactly what it is like. In fact, that is why my husband is your husband's role model. And I must tell you it works. Take the Depression, for example. We never really did anything to solve it. In fact, things were worse in l938 than they were in l933 but people THOUGHT we had done something, and that's what is really important. You tell Bill to always sound confident. He should keep on saying things like 'the economy is in the best shape it has been in fifty years'. Now never mind that it isn't true. If he just says it often enough, people will believe it. Just think of how well he did by telling the voters in l992 that the economy was in the worst shape since the Depression. People believed him even though it was an outright lie. It's all in how you say it, my dear".<P>

           The conversation continued with Hillary asking for advice on Bosnia: "I'm not sure what we should do. My husband got us into the war over there. We promised to get our troops out before the election, but there is no way we are going to be able to do that. In fact, we may be there for years. What do we do?" Eleanor Roosevelt answered : "Well, that's a tough one. Franklin got us into the war by ignoring all of the warnings and failing to prevent Pearl Harbor. But you see, Hillary dear, we had Hitler and the Japs. You don't have enemies people can identify with. I'm afraid you have a harder task. About the only thing you can do is to start to remove the troops before the election. Send new ones quietly a few at a time and be ready to deploy lots of them the day after the election. But if people think they are coming home on schedule, they will go ahead and vote for Bill."<P>

             "Now let me ask you Eleanor, you don't mind if I call you Eleanor do you?", Hillary continued, "I feel as if I know you. I've read everything I can about you, I admire you so much." Eleanor replied "It's all right dear. We used to be more formal, but I understand the times, so go ahead call me Eleanor". <P>

               "Well", said Hillary, "I don't quite know how to raise this question. But I know you've had experience. You see Bill hasn't been exactly faithful. I mean dealing with the Paula Jones matter in public and all, how ever did you cope?" Eleanor turned somber. "Well I had one advantage over you. The press didn't pry into our personal lives in those days. The boys who covered Franklin all knew about Lucy. But they didn't say anything. All the things that have been published have seen the light years after Franklin died. In fact, decades after I died. So I never had to cope with the public humiliation of it all."<P>

               But Hillary persisted. "I'm sure you knew. How did you put up with it?" Said Eleanor in reply: "My dear. It is worth it being First Lady, especially when you have your own agenda. I did. Franklin didn't much agree with it. But he was in no position to object. In those days if I had left him, he would have been finished. So he let me do my own thing. I see that Bill lets you do what you want as well. That's good. Any time he gets testy about your doing what you want, you just remind him of what you know and how if you confirmed all the rumors, even in this day in age, he'd be packing for Tennessee". <P>

               "Arkansas", Hillary interrupted. "We're from Arkansas." Eleanor apologized. "Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I knew it was one of those states down there. Personally I preferred the North."

               Hillary went on : "I have other problems. There is the cattle futures issue and the billings at the Rose law firm and the allegations that I was the go between for people who wanted favors from Bill when he was Governor. Franklin was Governor before he was President. How did you manage these things?" Eleanor shook her head. "I'm afraid I can't help you. Women didn't hold down those kind of jobs when I was around. I will say this. I did get into trouble from time to time, and I found loss of memory to be an excellent way to handle things. No one can prove you remember anything." <P>

              "I've tried that and so far it has worked. But I'm worried", Hillary confessed. Eleanor broke into a smile. "My dear, so long as you have Bill to lie for you, don't worry. People want to believe their President. And even if his wife is unpopular, and believe me dear I was unpopular, so long as they are comforted by what their President says, they'll keep you right where you are."<P>

                "Even if I am indicted?", Hillary asked. "Well now", said Eleanor, "I don't know about that. I was careful. I never did anything they could get me for later."<P>

                "And what do I do if Bill loses?", Hillary whined. Eleanor looked puzzled. "We never had to cope with that problem. And I don't think you will either. After Bill's term, you run and then the two of you can serve longer than Franklin and me. But don't worry, there is life after the White House. I mean I did commercials for oleo margarine. I'm sure there are plenty of things you can sell. And you can always try writing a book."<P>

                  "I just did", Hillary replied. "I'm surprised you haven't heard about it. It's called 'It Takes a Village.'" <P>

                   "I'm terribly sorry", said Eleanor", But down here we don't hear about many new books. We do see MTV videos a lot, so if you make one of those I'm bound to see it. It is part of our punishment."<P>

                   "I think Bill is about to make one. Do you think he should wear boxers or briefs", Hillary asked. Eleanor pretended not to hear the question. <P>

<h2>For Less Than This Colson Went to Jail
</h2>
<P>
<P>

<P>
What a difference a couple of years makes. On May 22, 1994, White House advisor George Stephanopoulos said this of Craig Livingstone, the then director of the White House office of personnel security: "He does a terrific job. All I know is that anything that has to do with security or logistics – Craig's going to take care of it. You don't have to tell him how to do it, when to do it. Just that it needs to be done, and he does it. And he knows how to cut through the bureaucracy and get things done." Stephanopoulos told this to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Livingstone's home town newspaper.
<P>When confronted with the quote late last week, Stephanopoulos now says, "I don't know him that well. He's a guy that was around. He came up to me one day and said 'my paper's doing this and would you give them a quote' and I said 'sure.' I never worked with him on a campaign but he seemed competent. What can I tell you?"  As to the contention that Livingstone knows how to cut through the bureaucracy, Stephanopoulos says, "I just can't think of a specific thing he handled."
<P>Which version of the truth from the White House do you believe? This is, in fact, THE crucial question as we ponder the meaning of the issue over the hundreds of FBI files on Republicans turned over to the White House. The first spin put out by the White House was that Livingstone and Anthony Marceca were just low level bureaucrats who made a mistake.
<P>Now comes Denis Casey, the former Gary Hart for President campaign coordinator in Western Pennsylvania, who tells us that Livingstone and Marceca were busy gathering dirt on union officials who supported Walter Mondale in 1984.  They were doing this in an effort to try to blackmail the officials into switching to Hart's side to the point where Casey demanded that they be fired. The Casey testimony casts a whole different light on this issue. Livingstone and Marceca, it would seem, were professional political assassins who placed in charge of all of the sensitive material gathered by the FBI on their political opposition.
<P>Now the question is who put them in their positions? Who understood their background? To whom did they report? What did Bill Clinton know and when did he know it?
<P>Attorney General Janet Reno is absolutely right in asking that Independent Counsel Ken Strarr investigate this matter. It is not something which any person connected with the Clinton Administration can be trusted to handle. Let's remember that Chuck Colson, former Nixon White House aide, went to jail for showing a single FBI file to a reporter. We need to know why these FBI files were requested and exactly how the information therein was used.
<P>The fact that George Stephanopoulos could change his story on Livingstone so easily suggests that it is going to be very difficult getting at the truth on this issue. At the heart of the matter is no less than this question: Is the United States still a free nation where reasonable people can disagree and still continue to practice politics, or have we gone down the road to a dictatorship where if our opponents win the election, the rest of us have to live in fear over what comes next? <P>

June 17, 1996

<h2>Hope for Continued Democracy in Russia
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>The Russian people had themselves a remarkable election on Sunday. This is not a nation which has a tradition of democracy and yet turnout was higher than for most nations which do not make voting mandatory.
<P>Terrorists tried, with a series of bombs throughout the nation, to intimidate the voters. They did not do so. And while the election wasn’t as fair as our elections, since the incumbent Boris Yeltsin controlled much of the television media, there is, nevertheless, substantial evidence that most of the Russian people followed the election.  There is also evidence that most of the Russian people were aware of the positions of the different candidates. 
<P>Since no candidate received the required 50% plus of the vote to be elected outright, there will be a runoff in three weeks between Yeltsin and Communist party boss Gannady Zyuganov. A word about that election in a moment, but first some thoughts on a few of the other candidates who ran.
<P>The surprise candidate who did far better than expected was General Alexander Lebed.   Lebed, on the one hand, is a supporter of democracy and free markets. On the other hand, he promises an authoritarian regime which will get tough with criminals. He often cites Chile under Gen. Pinochet as the appropriate model for Russia to prosper. The outcome in the runoff will probably be determined by where his votes go. Although Lebed is not pro-Communist, many of his supporters favor the Communist candidate Zyuganov because like Gen. Lebed, Zyuganov promises to bring back law and order. 
<P>Vladimir Zhirinovsky was the big loser in this election. The Russian voters apparently now see him for the fool that he is. He received only about 7% of the vote, a far cry from his showing in the last two parliamentary elections. No doubt he will favor Zyuganov in the runoff. But even if all of his voters go that route, it won’t be enough to put Zyuganov over the top. 
<P>The democratic reformers did make somewhat of a showing with their candidate Gregory Yavilinsky who drew more votes than Zhirinovsky. Yavilinsky may reluctantly support Yeltsin in the runoff. Therefore, he could emerge in a new Yeltsin cabinet if there is one. 
<P>Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev got so few votes that he hardly made the charts. This comes as a surprise only to Gorbachev. When Gorbachev left office he was terribly unpopular but he never believed that. His place secure in history as the man who opened up the process in Russia, he would have been well off to try to play the role of elder statesman. Instead he insisted on running because he believed the people were demanding his return. Now his stature is so diminished that it is clear he will never again play a role in Russian politics. 
<P>The runoff election is likely to be very close. First of all, some who voted for other candidates in this round will simply stay home. They feel they have no choice between Yeltsin and Zyuganov. Second, supporters of Yavilinsky, Sergei Filatov, and other Democrats will likely, very reluctantly, support Yeltsin. However, there are not enough of those votes to get Yeltsin the extra 15% he needs to win. 
<P>That is where Gen. Lebed comes in. Lebed will likely determine the outcome. If he goes with Yeltsin, he may be able to deliver enough of his vote to make the difference. If he goes with Zyuganov, he could give the Communist leader a real shot at being elected. 
<P>While the 35% of the vote is not exactly a ringing endorsement, it is remarkable that Yeltsin managed to get the most votes in the first round. Yeltsin has had to bear the burden of the enormous changes which have been visited on the Russian people these past five years. At one point he had sunk to only 8% in the public opinion polls and was written off as politically dead. The fact that he now has a fighting chance to win the runoff makes him the real "come back kid" of the democratic process. 
<P>The joke going around Moscow these days is that on the morning after the election, a Yeltsin aide comes to him and says he has good news and bad news.
<P>"What’s the bad news?" Yeltsin asks. 
<P>"The Communists got 55% of the vote," the aide says. 
<P>Yeltsin makes a terrible face and asks, "Then what’s the good news?" 
<P>"You got 65% of the vote!" the aide declares.
This election may not have been totally honest, but it is a far cry from the rigged-in-advance kind of elections the Soviets staged for the 70 years they were in power.
<P>Russia took a major step forward in its fledgling democracy with this election. Now the voters in the runoff will have a choice between continuing to edge forward, no matter how erratically, or to try to restore the past. My bet is, that despite all the hardships they are enduring, the Russian people will not try to turn back the clock. <P>

<h2>Schott Censorship Sets Bad Precedent
</h2>
<P>
<P>Schott Censorship Sets Bad Precedent
<P>What is going on here? On the same day that a federal appeals court rules that the attempt by Congress to keep children from getting access to pornography on the Internet is unconstitutional, baseball owners have deprived Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott of the right to run her own baseball club for two years.
So let me understand this. It is okay to make all sorts of filthy material readily available to kids via the Internet, but the owner of a baseball team doesn’t have the right to say stupid things.<P>

Far be it from me to defend the things Marge Schott has said. Most of her remarks display ignorance of history and disregard for the concept of the United States as a melting pot. But so what? Is this a crime?
Baseball owners have made it clear that Schott was disciplined, not for anything she did in connection with the management of the Reds, but because of "insensitivity." Wow! If insensitivity is a crime, some of our greatest athletic coaches will be soon out of jobs.<P>

It seems to me that the game of baseball, once known as America’s favorite pastime, has succumbed to a case of extreme political correctness. Schott has made some highly questionable remarks about Asians, for example. But no charge has been made that she discriminated against any Asian employee who might have worked for the Reds.<P>

It is quite one matter if Marge Schott were charged with discriminating against minorities who worked for her. That, after all, violates the law. But expressing her opinion? Louis Farrakhan has opinions which make me physically ill. No one, however, suggests he isn’t entitled to his opinions even though they exude racial and religious hatred. So why pick on Marge Schott?<P>
If patrons are offended by what Schott says, they can boycott Cincinnati Reds games. That’s the American way. But to punish the lady by taking away her property rights because she said "insensitive" things is anything but American.<P>

I am sure that acting Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig feels good about himself now that he has exhibited this burst of political correctness. Well, he shouldn’t.<P>

The precedent Selig has set may well come back to haunt him. That’s because the dictators of political correctness are always changing their standards. Who knows, maybe Selig will one day be deprived of the right to operate the Milwaukee Brewers because of something he says, which by today’s standards is perfectly acceptable.<P>

As to Marge Schott, she ought to find the same ACLU lawyers who handled the Internet case. I’ll bet the courts would overturn the decision of the baseball owners in a flash if they were given half a chance.<P>

<h2>"Dole Trashes his Base"
</h2>
<P>

<P>Bob Dole must have a death wish. His campaign seemed to get recharged when he announced his resignation from the Senate a few weeks ago. Last weekend he even seemed to forge a compromise on the abortion issue which everyone from Christie Todd Whitman, the liberal Governor of New Jersey, to Pat Buchanan, Dole’s rival for the GOP nomination, could live with. 
<P>The compromise would have retained the pro-life language in the GOP platform as it has been since 1980, but it would have included in the preamble a declaration of tolerance for opposing views on not only the abortion issue but other matters as well. It was a shrewd compromise which gave something to both sides who are deeply divided on the issue. Dole was widely praised for his leadership on the issue.
<P>No sooner had that matter been put to rest than the presumptive Presidential nominee re-opened the issue. Dole now insists that the so-called "declaration of tolerance" be included, not in the preamble, but as an amendment to the pro-life plank. That would have the effect of rendering the pro-life position of the party as meaningless. Moreover, such a declaration of tolerance wouldn’t apply to other issues that divide Republicans including NAFTA and GATT to the assault weapons ban to term limits. Dole denounced Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council in ferocious terms, the likes of which he has never unleashed on Bill Clinton. 
<P>This move was taken as a declaration of war by social conservatives. Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, who has been very friendly to Dole throughout the primary season, told Dole in plain English that what Dole was proposing was unacceptable. Later, a spokesman for the organization suggested that if that position prevails, Christian Coalition will have to sit out the Presidential election. Christian Coalition oriented voters constitute about a quarter of the Republican vote.
<P>As if that weren’t bad enough. Dole, in his departing speech from the Senate which was carried live by a number of the networks, went through a litany of the programs he had helped to pass during his years in the Senate. Almost all of them were liberal programs such as food stamps and the Americans for Disabilities Act which were fought hard by conservatives. As Steve Moore of the CATO Institute put it : "Some of us have tried hard to find a reason to vote for Bob Dole. By emphasizing terrible programs that we all fought, he is just reminding us why we can’t vote for him." 
<P>Indeed Dole’s speech had that effect among his hard core base. "It is clear that in a Dole Presidency we will get the same policies we are getting under Clinton. The difference is that there will be no resistance to those policies if they are pushed by Dole," one veteran conservative Republican pronounced. "Let him get elected with the votes of liberals," said another.
<P>But Dole wasn’t content in just alienating his activist base. He went on to put distance between himself and the freshmen House Members who have been the only breath of fresh air to hit the Republican party in years. In a broadcast interview, Dole said the freshmen had gone too far in the areas of education and the environment. That caused Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin to send a message to Dole: "If that is the party line, let me know and I’ll go and do something else. I have no intention of running against both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole this year." Neumann, who was elected in the closest race percentage wise in the nation in 1994, said Dole’s comments have put him in an impossible position politically, one which cannot be sustained in his district. 
<P>The freshmen, the only group to stand up and fight for principle in Washington in recent memory, now find themselves isolated from their party standard bearer. What Dole has done is to play right into the hands of the Democrats who have denounced the freshmen as "extremist." One Dole staffer suggested that Bob Dole wouldn’t be all that unhappy if some of the freshmen were defeated for re-election because then Dole wouldn’t have to deal with them when he becomes President. 
<P>There is a rule in politics which is almost never violated by successful candidates for President. First, consolidate your base. Then move outward from there. Bob Dole has spent the last week carpet bombing his base. If he wins the Presidency, it is clear that Dole wants to do so without the Christian right, principled economic conservatives, or the tough minded House freshmen. A Dole Presidency under those conditions, which no doubt would be accompanied by a Democratic Congress, would produce more victories for liberalism than Bill Clinton could ever hope to deliver.  As Eric Licht, President of Coalitions for America put it, "Bill Clinton couldn’t pass national health insurance, but Bob Dole could well do so." 
<P>I guess I am always open to being shown new ways to put together a winning electoral coalition. If Bob Dole can be elected President by trashing the heart of the party which nominated him, it will truly be an election for the history books. <P>

<h2>Justice Thomas Bests His Detractors
</h2>
<P>

<P>
<P>Three cheers to Justice Clarence Thomas for ignoring my advice. I talked to the Justice last Thursday (he is one of the three I don’t want impeached) and suggested that he not appear at an awards ceremony in suburban Washington because it would give too much of a platform to his opponents. Instead, I suggested, he ought to have a special picnic for the eighth grade students at the Supreme Court where he would be  in control of the situation.
<P>You will recall that Justice Thomas was invited by students at the Pullen School to speak at an awards ceremony held at Central High School in Prince George’s County, Maryland. The students had invited him after meeting with him while on a tour of the Supreme Court where he was the only Justice to take the time to visit with them in his chambers.
<P>When school board member Kenneth Johnson heard about the invitation, he went ballistic. Johnson said he would disrupt the appearance if Thomas came to the ceremony. That led the school Superintendent to un-invite Thomas. The school board, however, overruled the Superintendent and re-invited Thomas. Thomas was silent about his intentions right up until the time of the event last night.
<P>Armstrong Williams, the host of "The Right Side" on radio and on NET, and I both talked with Thomas late last week and got the impression that he was seriously considering not making the event. I suggested that if he went, the lead story would be the protest against him and his message to the students would be lost. That’s why I recommended the alternative, which would be a special event just for the students and no one else. Thomas could have legally kept the protesters out of the court.
<P>In retrospect I am glad Thomas ignored my advice. The likes of Kenneth Johnson should not have been able to silence the Justice by promising disruption. In fact, Johnson was able to muster only 80 protesters who were confined to another part of the building. Johnson complained bitterly that because Thomas had hinted, through Armstrong Williams, that he might not come, Johnson couldn’t get people to turn out. Maybe Thomas should be in charge of our military strategy as well!
<P>Thomas told the parents and children who, by the way, gave him standing ovations, "I deeply regret having brought some unwanted attention to this wonderful ceremony." In fairness, Thomas didn’t cause the attention. His detractors did.
<P>Late last night, following the appearance of Thomas at the ceremony, I did a half hour segment of Armstrong Williams’ syndicated radio show. Just about every caller was against Thomas. Williams and I did battle with them. The party line against Thomas is that he is a hypocrite because he is the beneficiary of affirmative action programs and now he wants them eliminated. I dispute that theory. Read Justice Thomas’ opinions. They are among the most profound ever rendered by any Justice.
<P>I do not think Justice Thomas needed affirmative action to get where he is. I think he succeeded on his own merits. One caller insisted, "I don’t want Justice Thomas as a role-model for my daughter." I asked him if he wanted Louis Farrakhan as a role model, since the same Kenneth Johnson who promised to disrupt a Thomas appearance sponsored a resolution before the Prince George’s County School Board which would have given teachers and students a day off to participate in the Million Man March. The caller said my point was irrelevant.
<P>There is something to the intensity of some of these callers and protesters which is beyond all reason. Maybe the Rev. Imogene Stewart, a  Black Washington civic activist who appeared on "The Right Side" last Friday, is on to something. She contends that while some in the black community cloak their opposition to Thomas in the rhetoric of affirmative action, what they are really angry about is that he married a white woman.
<P>Well, whatever it is, Thomas showed up his detractors. He proved to be a man of his word. He was gracious and self effacing. He gave the students good advice  such as "remember that good manners will open doors that the best education will not and cannot. Even though you may have strong feelings about matters, that does not give you license to have bad manners." Great advice. Kenneth Johnson can you hear what Justice Thomas said over the clatter of your own rhetoric?<P>

June 10, 1996
</h3>
<h2>
Some Freshmen Have Some Problems
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>I’ve said a fair amount over the past year and a half about the freshman class of Republicans, that eager group of legislators that swept into office in the Republican landslide year of 1994. As a group they have performed well for the nation. Unfortunately, their elders for the most part were not as eager to make the changes these freshmen felt they had a mandate to make. So the overall record of the 104th Congress is disappointing to say the least, but as a group, the freshmen are not to blame for this unfortunate fact. 
<P>As I say, taken as a group, the freshmen Republicans are an impressive lot. Individually, however, some of them have problems. There is Congressman Jon Christensen of Nebraska, whose campaign centered around family values. He wasn’t in office for a year when he filed for divorce and took the unusual step of forcing his wife to file an affidavit that she had been unfaithful. She now is contesting the divorce, saying she doesn’t want to break up the marriage. He says it is all over. He is in one tough race for re-election. 
<P>There is, of course, the soap opera like drama of Enid and Joe Waldholtz. Joe is on his way to the federal pen and the big question is whether or not he takes Enid with him. She has already dumped Joe and has even changed her name back to Enid Green, but she wisely chose not to run for the House again. 
<P>Then there is the very strange case of Rep. Wes Cooley of Oregon. Cooley came out of nowhere to win a state senate seat in 1992. When Rep. Bob Smith unexpectedly announced his retirement in 1994, everyone and his mother got in the race for the Republican nomination for Congress. Cooley won a seven way primary with under 30% of the vote and went on to win the rural conservative district rather handily with 57% of the vote. 
<P>Cooley is as affable a person as you would want to meet. You can well imagine him operating a country store, sitting around the cracker barrel and spinning tales. The problem for Cooley is that he is a Congressman now and people take what he says for real. 
<P>Cooley already has admitted that he lied about being married to the woman he now calls his wife. It seems that if the couple wasn’t married, she could still collect widow’s benefits from a previous marriage. But after he got elected to the state senate, Cooley thought perhaps they ought to regularize things. He had what was called an anniversary party, but it would appear that when he was said to be renewing his vows, he was, in fact, actually getting married. We don’t know for sure because Cooley has gone to the extraordinary length of having the date of his marriage kept sealed by the courts. 
<P>Cooley’s biggest problem stems from his claim that he served in a special unit of the military during the Korean war. He claims that the Pentagon lost all of his records. He also claims that every single person with whom he served is now dead. The unit was a secret one, he says, so he can’t disclose anything about it. When asked to at least recite some recollections from his days in the service, Cooley says his memory fails him. 
<P>Cooley blames all of his troubles on the news media and left wing opponents. Now lest you think I have taken up unsubstantiated claims by a media out to get the Oregon Congressman, consider this: Coalitions for America, a lobby organization of which I am the national chairman, holds a weekly luncheon in this building which is attended by Members of Congress and various conservative and pro-family groups. Among the attendees of this luncheon from time to time has been Rep. Wes Cooley. So when the allegations against him broke, I expected that he would want to give his side of the story. <P>
Instead, Cooley said nothing. Finally I called on him and asked him if there wasn’t something he wanted to tell his colleagues and philosophical allies. He said that all of the charges against him were false and made up by his enemies. I told him that if such charges were really false that we were the sort of people who would go to bat for him, we just needed to be equipped with the facts. He promised he would supply them just as he promised he would hold press briefings to refute the charges against him. No facts were produced and no such press briefings were held. <P>
Let’s be perfectly candid about it. Wes Cooley is lying. Former Rep. Bob Smith, who campaigned hard for Cooley after he won his primary, now says he is embarrassed by Cooley and has called on him to step down. Cooley says he will let the voters decide. They will indeed. His Democratic opponent now has a commanding lead in a district which is solidly conservative and Republican.<P>
The fact that Enid Green and Cooley vote right is beside the point. Members of Congress need to be role models. People in the community should be able to look up to them as prototype citizens.<P>
Enid Green at least had the decency to retire, although she should have resigned from her seat because she clearly obtained it by fraud. Cooley deceived the voters of Oregon by making exaggerated claims about his service to his country, about his education, about his marital status, and who knows what else. Cooley, having just won renomination for second term, should now step down and permit the Republican party to name some one else to take his place. By the way, in his district more people voted for others on the primary ballot than those voting to renominate Cooley.<P>
This is clearly a case where "None of the Above" or NOTA is badly needed. These conservative voters should have an additional choice between Cooley and his Democratic opponent who will vote against their wishes. They ought to have the chance to vote for "None of the Above" and void the election. But since NOTA is not on the Oregon ballot, it is now up to Cooley. Former Congressman Smith says now that he has spoken out against Cooley, no doubt Cooley will label him as part of a great conspiracy against him. That’s what Cooley told us at our lunch – that a great conspiracy was out to get him. Sorry, Congressman. The only thing that is out to get you are the lies you have told, the stories you have made up, the deceptions you have concocted. If you care at all for your country, instead of just yourself, then resign.  Resign so that your district, as conservative as it is, doesn’t contribute to the possibility of the Democrats re-taking the Congress. <P>
After so many years of telling so many lies, you may believe all of your own stories, Congressman. That’s fine. Retire to your ranch where no doubt the dumb animals will give you the attention you deserve.

<h2>
Third-party Candidate Would Force the Issues
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm has announced that he is joining the Reform Party of Ross Perot and has suggested that if Perot himself does not run for President, he (Lamm) just might do so. I hope he does. Not that I could vote for the former Governor of my adopted state. His positions on some of the social issues preclude that. But Dick Lamm is one very forthright and candid fellow. 
<P>Unlike Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Lamm is willing to frankly discuss the need to get entitlements under control. Dick Lamm doesn’t mind touching the so called third rail of American politics, namely Social Security. Governor Lamm is willing to tackle the enormous problem of the trillions of dollars in unfunded mandates. Lamm will discuss, while the others will not, the effect that our crushing national debt will have on future generations. Governor Lamm is not afraid to raise the conflict of interest questions which plague both political parties. He may be wrong on some things, but he is one honest fellow. 
<P>Dick Lamm, barring some remarkable turn of events, won’t be elected President if he is out there running on a third party ticket. But Dick Lamm can do an immense service to the American public by forcing the major parties to face up to the issues he raises. True, Perot has raised some of the same issues. But Perot is regarded as an eccentric. Lamm is non-threatening, yet highly articulate. He was very popular among voters in both parties when he was Governor of Colorado, even though he frequently said the unthinkable. 
<P>Numbers, charts, graphs, and even the reality of the impending bankruptcy of Medicare have not forced the major parties to face the truth. America’s debt is killing it’s future. But Dick Lamm, if he turns out to be the Reform Party candidate, will force the debate which America should have been having on these issues since 1960, indeed since the 1930’s. 
<P>America badly needs this debate. Our future depends on it. That’s why members of all parties, regardless of philosophy, ought to be cheering on Governor Lamm. If he runs, and raises the issues the other candidates refuse to face, the entire political landscape will change. Then maybe, just maybe, the 1996 election will have a lasting impact. <P>

<h2>
Virginia Primary a Test of Loyalty
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>A visitor from another state who might have happened upon one of Senator John Warner’s television commercials, aimed at voters in next Tuesday’s Virginia Republican primary, would probably think that Warner is the conservative candidate. The Warner commercial talks about tradition and how proud he is to be a part of Virginia’s venerable conservatism. But the record of three term Senator John Warner suggests he is anything but a true blue conservative. 
<P>Warner’s election was a fluke. In 1978, the newly found conservative majority in the Republican party nominated the young, articulate, and very attractive party chairman Dick Obenshain for the Senate. Obenshain seemed to be on the road to victory. But Obenshain was tragically killed when his light plane crashed in the Virginia countryside, leaving the party without a nominee for the Senate at the ninth hour of the election content. John Warner, who had spent a huge amount of money in trying to win the nomination, but who was gracious in defeat and had pledged to support Obenshain, was drafted as the GOP nominee.  
<P>Warner’s campaign was going nowhere and the conservatives who had picked Obenshain declined to support him. My longtime friend Dick Scaife of Pittsburgh called me and asked if I would put together a meeting of conservatives with Warner. I did so on October 7th of 1978. It was a contentious meeting which lasted two and a half hours. Warner ended up pledging to vote conservative on every issue that was raised from the Equal Rights Amendment to abortion and the SALT treaty with the Soviets. Conservatives got behind Warner and he pulled off the closest senate election in Virginia history. 
<P>Warner kept most of his promises during his first term although he had to be reminded of them from time to time. When he came up for re-election in 1984, he hardly had opposition. It was during his second term that he moved to the left. He opposed, for example, Ronald Reagan’s nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. On many crucial votes, he could be counted on by the liberals if they needed him. When he won his third term in 1990, nearly unopposed, he decided to go the distance. Up to that point, Warner had pretty much stayed out of Republican politics in the state of Virginia. 
<P>Looking at himself as invincible, the onetime husband of actress Elizabeth Taylor, waded in knee deep. When conservatives prevailed and nominated home school association executive Mike Ferris as their candidate for Lt. Governor, Warner refused to support him. Ferris lost narrowly to Don Beyer, the man who will be the Democratic standard bearer for Governor next year. 
<P>Then when some conservatives put forth the candidacy of Oliver North for the Senate against Senator Chuck Robb, Warner backed North’s intra-party rival, former Reagan budget director Jim Miller. Miller lost narrowly to North. So Warner went out and recruited former Virginia Attorney General Marshall Coleman to run as an Independent. Coleman drew just enough votes away from North to send Chuck Robb back to the Senate for another six years. So Miller, who had enjoyed Warner’s support in 1994, decided that was too much for him and declared his candidacy against Warner.
<P>Warner’s incumbency has drawn big bucks and Miller has not had the funds to run an aggressive campaign. Still, many conservatives are very bitter about Warner’s betrayal of their candidates. Republican National Committeeman Morton Blackwell, just overwhelmingly re-elected to a third term to that post last week-end at a state convention, said that if the Republicans re-nominate Warner, "we ought to take up a collection and erect, on Monument Avenue in Richmond, a statue of Benedict Arnold." 
<P>Warner, for his part, is openly courting Democrats to vote for him in the primary. Virginia has no party registration so anyone may vote in this primary. Polls show Warner ahead by a large margin but the Warner folks are worried. Moral indignation against Warner runs so high among activists that if they turn out and Warner supporters take his election for granted, Miller just might pull an upset.
<P>Miller is a solid down the line conservative but a colorless campaigner who has failed to excite people. Warner enjoys so much support among Democrats, that the Democratic nominee for the Senate, Mark Warner (no relation) is given no chance to win. 
<P>Still the contest in Virginia boils down to this: in this last half of the last decade of the 20th Century, is loyalty still a virtue?  Many Republicans say that Warner turned his back on them and his party and he has no right now to turn to them to seek another term in the Senate. When the votes are counted on Tuesday, it will be known if dancing with the girl who brought you to the party is still in vogue or if Republicans prefer someone who is more loyal to the Democrats and to himself than to the party whose label he reluctantly wears.<P>

<h2>
Qualifying Welfare Reform
</h2>
<P>
Guest Commentary by Rep Mark Neuman<P>

<P>This week in the House, a very important issue will be debated about a welfare reform plan known as W-2 Wisconsin Works.  
<P>While this plan is certainly about welfare reform, it is also about a much bigger, perhaps much more important issue.  It’s about taking power out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats and giving it back to the people.  It is about whether you control what goes on in your state, or whether the Washington bureaucrats will micro-manage every facet of your lives.  When the House passes this bill this week, we take the first major step toward saying "no" to Big Government and federal bureaucrats and saying "yes" putting power back in the hands of the people.
<P>Governor Tommy Thompson of my state has written a welfare reform plan which, I believe, could easily serve as a model for all states to follow.  
<P>This plan was debated for 18 months in Wisconsin.  It was the subject of countless public hearings and meetings.  And then it was overwhelmingly endorsed and passed by both Houses of the Wisconsin legislature – with bipartisan support – both Democrats and Republicans put their stamp of approval on this welfare reform plan.  
<P>But now, many inside the beltway want Washington bureaucrats to tear it apart.  
<P>Washington bureaucrats have grabbed so much power from the states recently,  that Wisconsin needs federal approval before the plan is allowed to be implemented.  That is why I have introduced legislation in the House that allows this plan, which President Clinton himself called "one of the boldest yet," to be put into action in Wisconsin.
<P>While I believe Governor Thompson’s welfare reform plan is an excellent one, my legislation doesn’t force any other state to adopt it.  It simply clears the way for Wisconsin to move ahead with its own welfare reforms.  
<P>This welfare reform plan was researched, written, debated and passed into law by the citizens of Wisconsin and their elected representatives.  It underwent the scrutiny of numerous public hearings and 18 months of public debate.  And as I mentioned, it was overwhelmingly passed with bipartisan support in the Wisconsin legislature.  
<P>Each House passed it with at least a two-thirds vote.  Further, Governor Thompson’s welfare reform plan was enthusiastically endorsed by President Clinton in his weekly radio address just three weeks ago.
<P>But as I said, regardless of the merits of this bill, this legislation represents a much bigger issue: and that is the issue of returning power back to you – the people.
<P>When I came to this Congress in 1995 – along with 72 other freshmen – we had two very specific goals in mind: 
<ul>
<LI>balance the budget; 
<LI>and reduce the size, scope, power and influence of the federal government. 
</ul>
<P>We were given a mandate from the people to get Washington off their backs and reduce the burdens and regulations Washington routinely imposes upon them.  My constituents are tired of mandates from Washington; they are fed up with the massive tax burden; and they are sick of Washington’s wasteful spending habits that put their children and grandchildren further and further into debt.  
<P>But this freshmen class is changing the way Washington works.  As I mentioned several weeks ago on this program, we are making great strides in balancing the budget and reducing wasteful Washington spending.  And this week the Senate takes another try at passing a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget – a measure which I wholeheartedly support.
<P>And now, with the legislation I have introduced this week, this Congress is taking a very important step in taking power and  influence out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats and returning it to you, the people who sent us here.  
<P>Some would have you believe that only the folks in Washington can have a monopoly on compassion.  Only they can truly see what the people out in the country really need.  Only Washington bureaucrats are fit to determine the needs of the people in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
<P>Folks, that’s just silly.  Governor Thompson, along with a bipartisan effort of both Democrats and Republicans in Wisconsin approved this welfare reform plan.  They know what is best for the people they represent, not the bureaucrats in Washington who never have to face the consequences of regulations they impose.  
<P>But now the Washington bureaucrats can’t stand not having their fingerprints on this welfare reform plan.  They want to review every detail.  They want to prescribe for you and for me what is best for us.
<P>This issue of welfare reform, perhaps more than any other, demonstrates the need to strip Washington of the immense power it now holds.   
<P>When we pass this welfare reform measure, it will open the door for other states to say "no" to mandates from Washington and "yes" to the wishes of the citizens. <P>

An Old Dog Learns New Tricks
</h2>
<P>
<P>An Old Dog Learns New Tricks
<P>Ever since Bob Dole became Senate Majority Leader in 1985 I have had a running argument with him. I often told Dole to bring measures to the floor of the Senate for a vote, regardless of whether or not you have enough Senators willing to pass the bills. By losing, you win. Those votes would reveal the liberals for what they are and help elect more conservatives to the Senate.<P>
Dole disagreed. He didn’t want to vote on anything unless he thought he had the votes to pass it. That is why he and his chief of staff Sheila Burke always sought the lowest common denominator legislation. The less controversial, the better the chance to rack up a big win. Of course, the less controversial, the less chance of accomplishing anything with the legislation. Historic opportunities were lost in many fields because the legislation Dole usually got passed was so bipartisan that it demonstrated no differences between the parties. I argued that without this contrast, voters would have no incentive to add to Dole’s ranks. He never seemed to get it, that is, until now.<P>
There is a great irony in the way Bob Dole will finish out his last week as the Senate Republican Leader. He will bring up measures, including the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, which have no chance of passage. In doing so, Dole will be trying to get across to the American voters some of the main differences between the parties. Dole has dared President Clinton to help get the last two votes needed to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment through the Senate. However, the President opposes the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. <P>
Who says you can’t teach an old dog new tricks? Dole now seems to understand, albeit during the last moments of his Senate Leadership, that you can win by losing. I honestly believe, had this been done more of the time, with thorough preparation and lots of prolonged debate, the public would finally see who was on which side of the different debates and would act accordingly at the next election. The fact that meaningless bipartisan, vanilla legislation would pass the Senate by big margins only served to confuse the electorate. All sides could take credit for almost nothing. No wonder so many incumbents were re-elected. <P>
Now at the eleventh hour Dole is going to lose in the Senate in a very high profile way. But in losing he may gain points with the American voter.<P>
Although Dole has seemed to learn something new at this last moment, in some things he is sticking to the past. Chief of Staff Sheila Burke, it seems, may end up in the Dole campaign after all. <P>
Some, such as American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene, say this just proves Bob Dole is loyal to his friends. Perhaps. I think it proves that Bob Dole does not believe he can get along without Sheila Burke after having become so dependent on her over these last few years. Keene says that Sheila Burke never pursued her own agenda, but rather she served Bob Dole by doing exactly what he wanted done. If that is the case, then Dole is, indeed, a lot more liberal than his voting record suggests. <P>
At any rate, we will soon learn the truth. Since Dole’s announced resignation from the Senate, the Dole campaign seems to have found new life and has begun to develop a consistent message. If Sheila Burke is truly the team player her defenders claim she is, she will go along with all of it and blend right in. Then Sheila, old Senate dog that she is, will have learned new tricks too. <P>
On the other hand, if Sheila behaves as she has over the past years in Dole’s office, she will begin to impose herself on various aspects of the campaign. If you read news accounts about how Burke is trying to get the Republican platform liberalized, then you will understand that it is the same old Sheila at work. And if David Keene is correct, she will be doing so at Dole’s bidding. <P>
I’m encouraged that Dole has finally caught on to how you can win in the long run by losing in the short run. Now let’s see if his new found wisdom rubs off on Sheila. Hope springs eternal, as the saying goes. <P>

Phony Jurist Takes Reporters for a Ride
</h2>
<P>
<P>On Friday morning I was driving to the NET offices when ABC radio news, at 9 a.m. Eastern, broadcast that one of the jurors in the Whitewater case in Little Rock had said she had read about the defendants before the trial and had a negative impression of them. What happened at the trial confirmed that view.<P>
I was stunned. If that statement were true, it meant big time trouble for prosecutor Ken Starr. Subsequently I heard the same story on another radio network and on CNN. I asked a couple of attorneys for their opinion and they told me that if such a juror had indeed come forward, it meant that the defense had solid grounds to get the convictions overturned.<P>
As viewers of "Paul Talk" know, we discussed this story on the show. Others had heard the same story and called in to ask questions. One viewer raised the possibility that perhaps this had been a planted juror – not an unreasonable suggestion under the circumstances. As I answered the questions I was thinking that the Clintons must be the luckiest people on the face of the earth and such a development, if true, could effect the plans of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to move forward on other cases.<P>
Friday night I was preoccupied with the wedding rehearsal dinner of my son, Steve, so I really didn’t  pay close attention to newscasts, although I did hear one or two. On early Saturday morning when our two Washington papers arrived, I expected to see this story on the front page. Perhaps it would be a banner headline in the Washington Post. I was puzzled when I saw nothing about it but the wedding was a few hours away and our household was preoccupied with other thoughts. Again, with the reception going on into late evening, I didn’t pay much attention to newscasts.<P>
When the Sunday papers arrived and I saw nothing of this story I knew there was something wrong. The Post, as a matter of fact, ran a four page spread, not including the beginning of the story on page one, to the effect that Hillary Clinton may now be in real trouble because her public statements do not match the facts in the Whitewater case. I don’t remember pages of coverage like this in the Post since Watergate.<P>
In any case, I began to search for the story of what happened to the juror. I listened to radio newscasts. I heard nothing. Finally, after church and before leaving home for a graduation party, there was the story on CNN’s Headline News, almost all the way through the news segment.<P>
It seems that the prejudicial statement which had been printed in the newspapers about the Whitewater trial was made not by an actual juror but by a woman of the same name as one of the jurors. The media kept hounding this woman, insisting that she was the real juror, despite her protestations that she was not. Finally, she became annoyed that they didn’t believe her and she decided to go along with their demands for a statement. That was when she said what was quoted on the various newscasts which I had heard. <P>
In short, the so called mainstream media had been had. I picked up my information from them which resulted in my comments on Friday’s show. I did add the caveat that my predictions would be true IF the woman had been quoted accurately. Nevertheless, I accepted as true what they had broadcast. So my apologies to all the viewers of "Direct Line" who went about their week-end thinking that the Whitewater convictions would be overturned and that even Governor Tucker might not resign the governorship of Arkansas after all.<P>
What of the responsibility of the networks, who promoted this story, to broadcast the fact that they had been had on their same newscasts? Although I was preoccupied, I did hear several newscasts on Saturday as we were going to and from the church and the reception and back home. But I heard not a word about this from the same news organizations which had made the story a big deal the day before.<P>
What of the newspapers which were giving extensive coverage to Whitewater? Why was there not a word that the electronic media had been taken? An attorney I discussed this case with at last night’s graduation party told me that the real juror would probably have a good slander case against the media which broadcast information, damaging to her reputation, when they were quoting someone else. The real juror, so far as I know, has made no comment. Maybe she is busy talking to her lawyers.<P>
Someone ought to hold the broadcast news organizations accountable for what they did. That includes NET. None of us checked ourselves to determine if, in fact, a juror had made this statement before we broadcast it. It was the height of irresponsibility for them to have broadcast what they did and it was, frankly, irresponsible of me to have just repeated it without a call to Ken Starr’s office to verify the story. The only thing I can say in our defense is that we don’t have the huge news departments that the other networks have, and I, unfortunately, have almost no time to prepare for my show since I do this as a sideline, second to my duties as the CEO of NET as well as the CEO of the Free Congress Foundation.<P>
I hope all of us involved have learned a lesson about old fashioned journalism. Verify your story before airing it. I should not have assumed that because I had heard the story on three networks it was gospel. For that I profoundly apologize to my viewers. You deserved better. And all I can promise is that I will do my best to see that we don’t repeat the same mistake again. That’s all for Direct Line for tonight.<P>

"Elite Hits Justice Thomas Again"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was invited to speak next month at the Thomas G. Pullen Creative and Performing Arts School in Maryland.  This week, school officials say they have now "uninvited" Justice Thomas.  They have told him not to address the school’s June 10 awards ceremony. The reason: because of  threats of a protest.
<P>``Several parents and other community members ... expressed their concern about a possible visit by Justice Thomas and in fact, threatened to stage some kind of protest,’’ Chris Cason, a spokesman for the Prince George’s County school system in suburban Maryland, said Wednesday.
<P>In short, Maryland school officials have told a member of the United States Supreme Court he is suddenly no longer welcome at their event because the school system is now worried about even the threat of a protest from several people.  What the leaders of this school system have done is shameful. They have dishonored their original commitment to Justice Thomas and by doing so they have dishonored themselves as well as the school system they are supposed to represent. They have chosen to cower to threats of a few rather than stand on the principle of their original commitment.
<P>The action by Maryland’s Prince George’s County school system sends a chilling message to students. In effect what the school system says by this is that children must heed the bullying threats of the few in order to get along. It says children must put aside doing what is right in favor of doing what is safe. The action signals to children that freedom of speech for the many can be shouted down even by the threatened protest of an elite few.
<P>Of course, it is no accident that the uninvited Justice is Clarence Thomas, who is, by the way, one the most principled jurists ever named to the bench.  You see, unlike the leaders of this Maryland school district, Justice Thomas is not politically correct. His actions are not dictated by the threats of the radical few. In decision after decision on the bench, he has proven an unwavering loyalty to one thing: the United States Constitution. Because of that, almost daily, Justice Thomas is pummeled by the liberal media which hates the idea of a black conservative holding a such a powerful position.
<P>But there’s one thing in particular that Justice Thomas has going for him: he doesn’t care what they think. In a meeting several months with liberal reporters who complained about his position on the issues, Justice Thomas told them, "I’m here to stay. Deal with it!"
<P>Deal with it. The character of Justice Clarence Thomas has been horribly and ignobly assassinated by the establishment elite and yet this man lives.
<P>The action of the Prince George’s County, Maryland, school system proves one thing: there are two kinds of public officials: those who cower before the shrill of an elite few and those who act according to principle. Pity the students: the former have defrauded these children the right to hear the latter.<P>

"the Jury Did Not Believe the President"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>Last Week, President Clinton went into a tirade before the cameras, accusing Bob Dole of raising the character issue.  Over the weekend President Clinton was busy down-playing the active duty military defense his attorneys want to use against the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.  Yesterday President Clinton went before the cameras to remind the voters that he was not on trial in Arkansas.  Bob Dole need not utter a word about it. With each action, President Clinton’s character is becoming his own third rail.
<P>Before convicting Susan McDougal, her former husband James McDougal and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker, the jury in the Whitewater trial heard taped testimony from President Clinton.  It is extraordinary for a sitting president to testify in such a trial.  That testimony was critical to the defense.  The McDougals were former partners of Bill and Hillary Clinton.  At the very least, the president’s testimony ought to have led to the acquittal of Susan McDougal.  Instead the jury returned 24 guilty verdicts against the each of the defendants.  The president testified and yet the jury did not believe him.
<P>We’re told jury members even prayed before reaching their decision. With yesterday’s conviction, Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker – a Democrat – said he will resign by mid July.  In doing so, he chose not to try and run the state from the "big house" but instead to surrender his post to Lt. Governor Mike Huckabee – a Republican.  That conviction and subsequent resignation alone breaths new life into an issue which has dogged this Administration since the beginning.  After all, the president testified, and the jury did not believe him.
<P>Now the voters will see Whitewater as a warning to check the White House silverware.  Now the Congress will see Whitewater as a green light to pursue its own investigations with little risk of finger pointing over partisanship.  Now reporters will see Whitewater as an opportunity to compete for the Pulitzer prize.  But more than anything else, yesterday’s Whitewater convictions give instant credibility to the efforts of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Why? Because the president testified and the jury did not believe him.
<P>Now Starr will be free turn his attention to the one most vulnerable figure in this case – first lady Hillary Clinton. Already a compelling question is being asked in the minds of those familiar with this case.  It is a question establishment players may find too indelicate to ask. So I’ll ask it.  Did Hillary Clinton perjure herself?  Now, mind you, that is not a question for Bob Dole to ask.  Whitewater is not an issue to mingle with a presidential race designed to run on issues.  If Whitewater does prove the undoing of President Clinton, it will happen because of Bob Dole’s obvious silence than were he and his campaign to attempt to force the issue. Now Dole can boldly proclaim real issues without ever mentioning Whitewater. All because the president testified and the jury did not believe him.

"Clinton Should Stay Out of Foreign Elections"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
By this time tomorrow we may know the projected winner in the Israeli elections. 
<P>By all measures, the contest will be determined by a razor-thin margin. The choice for Prime Minister is between the incumbent Shimon Peres and the challenger Benjamin Netanyahu. But in a sense, it is a contest between the old political order and a new order where the outcome depends largely on teenagers voting for the first time and refugees from the former Soviet Union who are also participating in their first Israeli election. 
<P>It has been an interesting roller coaster of an election. Netanyahu was chosen by the opposition Likud bloc last year and immediately began to challenge the so called peace process supported by the late Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin. Netanyahu jumped to a substantial lead in the polls and there was talk that Rabin was finished politically. Indeed the rally at which Rabin was shot was being held to drum up political support for the sagging fortunes of Rabin. 
<P>When Foreign Minister Shimon Peres took over from Rabin and the media tried to blame Netanyahu for creating the climate which led to Rabin’s death, Peres took what seemed to be an insurmountable lead in the polls. But Arab terrorist attacks and the ineffective Israeli response to them has permitted Netanyahu to climb back, inch by inch, to the point that he is now in a statistical dead heat with Peres and may even be slightly ahead with only 2% of the vote still undecided. 
<P>The outcome in this election will have an impact here in Washington. Throughout our history, we have always had our favorites in foreign elections. Hints were dropped here and there about what Washington thought and there were subtle moves to indicate our preference. But this time, President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and other Administration officials have gone full tilt for Peres. At the moment polls showed the election tightening, Clinton called a hastily improvised summit meeting with Peres which was nothing more than a photo opportunity for the commercials which are now running on Israeli television. Of course promises of more foreign aid to Israel were suggested, IF Peres is re-elected. 
<P>The Clinton Administration in word and deed has left no stone unturned in its effort to influence the Israeli voters who know full well that there would be no Israel at all were it not for America. They also know how dependent Israel is on American economic aid so when "big brother" says he wants Peres, it is politically significant. But it may have backfired on Clinton and if so, the price to be paid will be high. 
<P>I had discussions with Netanyahu some years ago when he served in Washington. He is one tough customer. In fact, he may be the bluntest politician running for any office anywhere in the world. He would have no hesitancy in facing down Clinton and company the way he has faced down all of his domestic political enemies, which are many. 
<P>The Arabs, who have found common ground with Peres, would find that they had quite another kind of politician to deal with if Netanyahu wins. The Arabs who are eligible to vote in the Israeli elections are backing Peres nearly unanimously. 
<P>Directly interfering in a foreign election is not only a big gamble, it goes against the democratic principles we claim we espouse. This is an election for the citizens of Israel to decide, not for Washington to dictate.
<P>The United States is also intervening similarly in the Russian elections where we have done everything but carry the suitcases for Boris Yeltsin. Indeed our involvement has become one of the principal issues in the elections. Gregory Yavilinsky, who is the one candidate who comes closest to professing the democratic and free market ideals we claim to stand for, is outraged because until the United States and its Western partner intervened massively for Yeltsin, he was thought to have a shot at the election. That intervention, done at the taxpayer’s expense, may have propped up Yeltsin but it has also played right into the hand of the leading candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, whose main issue is that a plot on the part of the West caused the Soviet Union to collapse and thus it must be restored. 
<P>Bill Clinton has proved to be a masterful politician when it comes to handling the Republican Congress. With the media as his ally, he seems to be galloping to a second term and perhaps taking the Congress with him. His opponents claim he is guilty of deception and political manipulation. Be that as it may, Bill Clinton ought to stick to campaigning in this country. His overt intervention in foreign elections is dangerous either way those elections go. 
<P>Bill Clinton and company are big supporters of the New World Order so they see it as their duty to intervene. But the American taxpayers have no such obligation and through our elected officials in Congress we ought to demand that this worldwide manipulation of the democratic process be stopped before it drags us headlong into another world war.<P>

"God Is the Answer for the 21st Century"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>

<P>On this Memorial Day we remember those who have given their lives so that America may remain a free and independent nation. That question – whether we will remain a free and independent nation – as relevant at the close of what has been called the American Century as it was at the beginning of this Century. Only now the threat to America’s future is not coming from an ancient European order, nor Hitler’s National Socialists, nor the evil empire of Communism. The external threat comes from Moslem fundamentalists who wish to destroy the concept of the nation state, the Chinese and Japanese military/commercial complex which seeks to overrun the rest of the world by economic invasion, as well as from the United Nations which seeks to destroy the concept of sovereignty.
<P>As we pray for those who have served their country well this past Century and before, let us call to mind those who assisted their country in unpopular causes. As painful as it was for the families whose loved ones were killed in the Great World Wars, they nevertheless had the esteem of the community because a member of their family was killed in pursuit of what was believed to be a great cause by the populace. 
<P>Pity those families who had loved ones killed in Vietnam, or who served America silently in the Cold War. There was little community comfort for those killed in the unpopular Vietnam war and as to the cold war, its many victims remain largely unknown because they served as silent agents of America in this undeclared conflict.
<P>And while we are at it, let us call to mind those who now serve their nation in unpopular locations from Bosnia to Macedonia to Haiti. Some will not return and because these conflicts lack popular support back home, the families involved will not enjoy the sort of support from mediating institutions which was forthcoming during the World Wars or even the Korean conflict. 
<P>This dark Century is ending with many of the names and locations with which the 20th Century began. We have by no means fought the wars which ended all wars. Indeed there are a record number of conflicts worldwide, many of them brutal civil wars where there seem to be no good guys or bad guys or even any rational cause at stake. 
<P>For the deaths of those Americans we commemorate on this day not to have been in vain, this nation must get back to the understanding that there will be no peace without a change in men’s hearts, and there will be no change in men’s hearts without God. As we head toward the 21st Century, man’s synergistic co-operation with God will alone bring the tranquillity and order we all seek. If only God will grant our leaders the wisdom to understand that reality.<P>

"Why Clinton is Winning in the Polls"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>Remember those grade school stories of long ago about George Washington telling his father, "I cannot tell a lie. I chopped down the cherry tree," or Abraham Lincoln reading books by the light of the fire in his family’s log cabin?
<P>Well if the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll is correct, you can forget all of that. 
<P>When asked if having someone of sound moral character was important in electing a President, only 22% of the respondents said yes. When asked if having a President who understood the problems of people like you was the most important factor in choosing a President, 77% responded in the affirmative.
<P>No wonder Bill Clinton is killing his rivals in the polls. In the same survey, 57% said he deserved another term in the White House. 
<P>The American people now want a President who feels their pain, not a President who has the strength of character to lead the nation. I guess that is why Bill Clinton will get by with asking that the Paula Jones lawsuit be delayed because he is Commander-in-Chief and thus is eligible to invoke a law passed at the time of World War II.  The law Bill Clinton is hiding behind was aimed at preventing a GI in a fox hole from being sued because he didn’t send a payment for an appliance on time. 
<P>At a time when Admiral Boorda supposedly killed himself to avoid shame, Bill Clinton has no shame and the public thinks it is great. I guess if their President has no standards, they can excuse their own behavior somehow.  
<P>If moral character means next to nothing to Americans then no wonder Bill Clinton is America’s favorite. 
<P>Bill Clinton does tell people what they want to hear. He is for the gas tax repeal. He is for Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson’s welfare plan. He is for the bill to permit states to ban same sex marriages. He is for the balanced budget. He supports all the things the rest of us do. Never mind that his Administration has been in the opposite camp on all these issues. He passed the gas tax he now seeks to repeal. He vetoed the same sort of welfare reform Thompson has initiated. His administration has been in the forefront of supporting the homosexual agenda. He has vetoed the balanced budget. But reality doesn’t matter. As long as Clinton says the right things, never mind what he does. 
<P>Yes, Bill Clinton is obviously the right man for these times. Times when apparently honesty and truth and integrity and morality take a distant second place to feeling good. One thing Bill Clinton can do better than anyone else, no matter how bad things really are, is make us feel good. Chelsea is such a lucky kid to have a father like Bill.
<P>

"A Call for Impeachment of the Six Justices"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>In the history of nations, there comes a time when a crossroads is reached. Down one road is the slippery slope to perdition. It is the easier road, but at its end civilization lies in ruins and historians are left to chronicle the demise. Up the other road is the narrow, difficult path to the recovery of sovereignty of the people. The latter road is fraught with peril and many turn back along the way. But for those who make it, the possibility of passing on the heritage of the nation is made possible. 
<P>I believe we have reached such a crossroads with the Supreme Court’s decision this week which struck down Amendment Two of the Colorado Constitution. This sweeping declaration by the Court is now being celebrated, if you will pardon the term, with gay abandon by those in the society who seek to undue all civilized restraints. It will take us down the road to the ultimate destruction of our society. 
<P>Again the Court has invented a new right under the Constitution which was never contemplated by the Founding Fathers. It was never given to the Court by any vote of the legislature or referendum of the people. The Supreme Court has now struck down, it would seem for all time, the one weapon citizens thought they had to preserve their society – the vote of the people.<P>
The issue was simple enough. The people of Colorado voted to instruct their own legislative bodies not to give special rights to homosexuals. No rights were taken away. Only rights not enjoyed by other groups in society were enjoined. <P>
The state of Colorado presented several arguments to meet the reasonableness test which the Court imposes in consideration of such issues. But six Supreme Court Justices rejected all those arguments and told the people of Colorado: You have lied to us. We here know that the reason you voted as you did is because you are bigoted against homosexuals. So we will thwart your will. We will void your sovereignty. We, the elite, will overturn your decision and we will open the door to anyone who feels he has been defeated by the democratic process to seek our protection from the people. <P>
The Justices said that the Colorado amendment "imposes a special disability upon (homosexual) persons alone. Homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without constraint." But as an editorial in the Chicago Tribune suggests, "The inflated rhetoric masks analytical weakness. All the amendment says is that gays can’t obtain civil rights protection without amending the state constitution, which they are free to attempt. They are at no more of a disadvantage than any other group adversely affected by their state constitution."<P>
This same Court, not a decade ago, said that it was constitutional to criminalize the behavior of homosexuals. They can be arrested and jailed for what they do, but the rest of us can be jailed for trying to prevent them from having special rights and protections not enjoyed by other groups of citizens. <P>
This is only the beginning, as various homosexual rights groups gleefully proclaim. This decision paves the way for the complete acceptance and sanction by this society of a lifestyle which is openly condemned in the Bible more times than any other specific sin. "An abomination unto the Lord" can now receive privileged treatment from legislative bodies. If this decision is allowed to stand, historians will look back upon this time as the critical turning point in our society. <P>
What is to be done? In the past I would have exhorted you to elect a President who would change the High Court by the appointment Justices who would adhere to the Constitution. That was the cry of Richard Nixon in the 1968 Presidential election. Nixon effected no such change. Nor, as it turned out, did Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, or, of course, Bill Clinton. Each of them contributed Justices who constituted the 6 to 3 majority of the Court on the Colorado decision.<P>
It is clear that no matter who we elect to the Congress and no matter what protective statutes they pass, this Court will declare them unconstitutional. The Marriage Protection Act is making its way through the Congress right now. By the standard of this Court, declaring that homosexuals can’t marry constitutes bigotry. It is also clear that a vote of the people in the so-called sovereign states means nothing to this Court as it demonstrated in this case as well as in the recent case on term limits.<P>
There remains but one option for citizens who wish to protect themselves from the tyranny of the majority on this Supreme Court: impeachment.<P>
It is not a course I recommend lightly. In the early 1960’s when the John Birch Society was pushing to impeach Earl Warren, I didn’t buy into the idea even though I detested the decisions of the Warren court. There were many other remedies available, or so I thought, such as electing the right kind of President. In the mid 1960’s when then Congressman Gerald Ford first raised the possibility of impeaching Justice William O. Douglas, I opposed the idea in a radio editorial even though I found Douglas and his views reprehensible. But this time it is different. We are out of remedies. Impeachment is our only hope of bringing a Court which is out of control, back under control. <P>
I would remind you that Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist paper number 81, wrote of the "important constitutional check which the power of instituting impeachment would give to (Congress) upon members of the judicial department."  Hamilton said, "This is alone a complete security. There can never be danger that the judges, by a series of deliberate usurpation on the authority of the legislature, would hazard the united resentment of the body entrusted with it."<P>
Indeed, the National Legal Foundation has compiled a history of impeachment which shows that in the early part of our nation’s history, the legislature was far more ready to act upon impeachment of judges, even a Justice of the Supreme Court, than we are today. That time was closer to the intent of our founding fathers. <P>
To the argument that impeachment can only be initiated for matters such as embezzlement or bribery, let me cite what then Minority Leader Gerald Ford said in 1970 during his drive to impeach Justice Douglas:  "What, then, is an impeachable offense? The only honest answer is that an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history; conviction results from whatever offense or offenses two thirds of the other body considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office." As Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in his opinion in Rochin vs. California, justices who do not restrain themselves are subject to only two remedies. A constitutional amendment or impeachment. <P>
I understand the implications of what I am recommending. I have no illusions that the Senate would remove these Justices from office. But the mere act of initiating impeachment would finally focus the attention of this nation on the enormity of the crimes which this Court has committed against our constitutional form of government.<P>
Rather than stand aside and watch this nation slide further down the path to ultimate destruction, I hope and I pray that citizens will petition their Representatives to impeach the majority of this court and in doing so, will employ the one remaining remedy they have to save the nation. That’s all for Direct Line for tonight. <P>

"Dole’s Bold Move"

<P>
<P>
<P>
"Dole’s Bold Move"
<P>
I thought I would wait until the dust settled a bit before commenting on Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole’s gamble to resign and run without office for the Presidency. That I was surprised by this development is an understatement. That Sheila Burke was not one of the five people in the world who knew several weeks ahead of time that Dole was going to do this, is the best element of all. It demonstrated that at last Dole had shed his emotional dependence on Burke, which is a positive development. <P>
Dole demonstrated that it is possible to teach an old political dog new tricks. Most of us who thought we knew him well did not believe he had it in him to pull this off. After all, even if he lost the Presidency, Dole still would have been the Republican Leader. Although there was brave talk about running someone against him, when it came to the moment of truth, he probably would have remained Republican Leader for another two years. <P>
The Dole move probably means that Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott becomes Majority Leader. He will likely prove to be a far more energetic and able Leader than Dole and that has boosted the morale of the Republican Senators. So giving all of this up to go after the big prize indeed was a stunning development, at least in Washington. In the rest of the nation, it was not greeted as such a remarkable event because the rest of the nation is sensibly not as caught up in politics as Washington. <P>
The Dole move did have an effect on his campaign. It gave his troops new hope that he could win, which is something he badly needed to do. It afforded him a new opportunity to redefine himself. Up to now, to the extent that anyone knew anything about Bob Dole, it was that he was the consummate Washington Insider, not exactly a compliment these days. The Dole move represents a break with the past, even though stunned Democrats bitterly complain that Dole can’t shed 36 years of Congressional service just like that. <P>
Now comes the hard part. Without the advantages that being Senate Majority Leader gave him to generate headlines, Dole must distinguish himself boldly from President Bill Clinton. Can Dole, who supports Clinton on Bosnia and China really distinguish himself from Clinton on foreign policy? Can Dole, who is no stranger to tax increases, really be credible in calling for a tax rate reduction? Can Dole, who voted for almost all of Bill Clinton’s judicial appointments, really come down hard on the sort of judges Bill Clinton has appointed? <P>
The Dole camp has maintained that this election would be about character and integrity. Unfortunately for Dole, all of the latest polls show that the public, by a large margin, actually believes Bill Clinton is more honest and has greater integrity than Bob Dole. That is probably the most remarkable development of this campaign. If someone like Bill Clinton, who has made a career out of dissembling, can sell honesty and integrity to the American public, Bob Dole had better hope that he can distinguish himself from Clinton on issues.<P>
Clinton is not helping Dole in any way. Dole was about to deliver a speech on welfare reform and the Clinton folks heard about it. Clinton rushed to embrace the welfare reform model proposed by Wisconsin Republican Governor Tommy Thompson. Republican Governors were outraged, but Bill Clinton got on the scoreboard first. <P>
A  Washington Times cartoon showed Clinton in the form of a parrot in a cage next to a radio. On the radio was news of Dole’s impending speech on welfare reform. The Clinton-like parrot squawked "Welfare reform. Bawk. Welfare reform." That is about the size of it but Clinton has done it well. <P>
The truth is that the Republican Congress sent the President two versions of welfare reform, both of which he had praised at one point. Clinton vetoed both. <P>
Therein lies the one hook that Dole has on Clinton and one which could prove to be decisive in this campaign. The President says one thing and does the opposite. Voters may think they trust Bill Clinton right now. They may think he agrees with them on the issues. But if Dole can pound home the truth that Bill Clinton is, in a sea of Washington hypocrisy, the biggest fish of them all, then Dole may actually have an effective weapon against the President. <P>
Voters, at the end of the day, dislike hypocrisy more than anything else. It remains to be seen if Dole can be bold enough, after this very bold restart to his campaign, to carry that issue to the finish line. <P>

"Preempting the FDA Power Grab"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
<P>

<P>
I am not a chess player but it seems to me that Philip Morris has dealt a rather decisive blow to the plan of food and drug czar David Kessler to assert jurisdiction over the tobacco industry. <P>
Philip Morris has announced that it will seek federal legislation to make it a crime to sell tobacco to kids under age 18. Vending machines would be banished. Sale of single cigarettes would also be forbidden. Sampling would not be permitted except in areas where minors are denied access. Retailers would have to certify that they and their employees will enforce the law. <P>
The plan would also ban tobacco products from T-shirts and hats. There would be tobacco free zones where advertising tobacco products would not be permitted. No advertising would be allowed in any transit vehicle or in terminals. Tobacco products could not sponsor any sporting event where there is a significant youthful audience. <P>
Philip Morris Vice President Steve Parrish challenged President Clinton to support this legislation and to drop what Parrish calls the unconstitutional efforts of the FDA to assert jurisdiction over tobacco products. The President can avoid years of costly litigation, Parrish said, by getting on board this legislation and getting the FDA to drop its rule making procedure. Now, clearly, we will see if President Clinton wants to do something about the problem of teenage smoking or if he just wants to expand the power of one of his favorite government agencies. <P>
As commendable as the Philip Morris initiative is, still it federalizes a matter which ought to be left up to the states. But even if the states were to adopt all of the suggestions of the Institute of Medicine, whose recommendations Philip Morris followed in coming up with their legislation, there is still no substitute for parental guidance and parental example. <P>
If adults are really concerned about teenage smoking, they ought to take it seriously when they learn that their children are smoking. They ought to stop smoking themselves. Laws, especially federal laws, are no substitute for parental responsibility. <P>
While we would rather see Congress pass a law than a federal agency seize power in an unconstitutional fashion, members of society should turn less to federal laws and more to themselves if societal problems are going to be solved. <P>

"New Spin on Natural Laws"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<center>
by Mark Weaver
</center>

<P>
The past hour’s discussion of the issue of gay marriage may make you wonder where our culture is heading.  What won’t people do for a thrill?  What natural laws won’t they flout?  Well, wait till you hear this!
<P>Frightful new attractions are popping up across the country this summer, luring children and flouting the law of ...GRAVITY.  
<P>A new roller coaster opening June 1st at Six Flags Magic Mountain is designed to break the 100 mile-an-hour barrier for the first time. The ride, called Superman the Escape, propels you from a standstill to 100 mile-an-hour in seven seconds up a four-hundred-foot tower, where you float in zero gravity until you drop backward.    That’s also at one-hundred miles an hour.  You are weightless for about 6 seconds, another record.
<P>But that’s not all.  Competition is pushing designers to make rides faster and higher.
<P>Paul Ruben of the trade magazine Park World says "We’re in the roller coaster arms race."   He should know.  His job has involved riding 400 roller coasters.  He says "I’ve seen this occurring for 20 years or more. Every park likes to have bragging rights to the fastest, wildest ride for at least one year."
<P>Las Vegas makes its bid with two rides called The Big Shot and The High Roller, both on top of a new one-thousand foot tower. The High Roller tools around a track near the top. The Big Shot shoots you up toward the top then drops you back.  Said one man,    "This is the most exciting thing I’ve ever done next to jumping out of an airplane," (which I wouldn’t do either.)
<P>Superman and Big Shot use "Star Wars" technology - electromagnetic motors developed for the military.  The motors—white boxes along the tracks—pull magnets on the cars, shooting you faster as you cross each one.    Scientists experimented with them to shoot satellites into orbit on tracks. On Superman, YOU are the payload.
<P>Electromagnetic propulsion has already replaced chains and motors on rides in Mexico City, Kentucky and Wisconsin. Other such rides are opening at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, Mo.; Universal Studios Florida; and Dreamland, near Sydney, Australia.  
<P>Promoters in the amusement business have been bragging about hundred mile-an-hour roller coasters since the 1920s. But that was before radar guns and truth-in-advertising laws.    Actually, 82 mph is the record right now, claimed jointly by Desperado at Buffalo Bill’s Casino in Stateline, Nev., and the Steel Phantom in Kennywood, outside Pittsburgh.    
<P>What’s it going to be like to ride Superman the Escape?  Rumor has it that Paul Weyrich is going to be the FIRST rider, and he’ll give you a full report.<P>

"We Are Winning"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P><center>
by Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI)
</center>
<P>
<P>In 1995, I came to Congress along with 72 other newly elected freshman Members.  
<P>Before any of us even took our oath of office, we resolved ourselves to achieving a very specific goal – to reduce the federal deficit, to balance our budget and to eliminate wasteful Washington spending.  	
<P>Now, just 16 months later, I have good news to report: we are winning this battle!
<P>It hasn’t been easy, I can assure you of that.  But the results we have achieved, are well worth the effort.
<P>Let me show you the financial picture of our nation, when I came here, and where we stand now. 
<P>When we arrived here a year ago, this is what we found:  The red line on this chart illustrates the problem of the federal deficit.  It was at about $200 billion per year and growing indefinitely.
<P>If we had allowed this trend to continue, our country would sink further and further into debt, creating a disastrous future for our children and grandchildren.  But we did not allow that to happen.  We took action.
<P>First, we passed a recessions bill.  That means that right off the bat, we took $11 billion of wasteful spending out of the budget.
<P>Then the appropriators went to work.  John Kasich, the chairman of the Budget Committee, set a goal and said $23 billion of wasteful spending had to be eliminated. "Come in $23 billion under the previous year, or our plan to balance the budget won’t work," Kasich told them.
<P>Folks, this is the first time in a generation this has been done. 
<P>By December, this is where we were.  We were making progress, but still, we dared to dream.  We dared to dream that we could restore a better future for this Nation.  We dared to dream that we could get our country back on track.
<P>If you look at this chart, you see that this green line is the path to a balanced budget, and the road to a secure financial future for our children and grandchildren.
<P>So we set a deficit target for fiscal year 1996.  That target was $157 billion.  So what happened?  The financial markets looked at this and they reacted positively, and exactly as predicted.
<P>The most positive and helpful sign for the American people was that interest rates stayed down.  And when that happened, more people – especially younger folks – could afford to buy houses and cars.
<P>This created jobs and job opportunities for our young people because somebody has to build those houses and cars.
<P>Folks, this is exactly how America is supposed to work.
<P>What followed next was our unemployment rate went down, as did the welfare rolls and interest cost to the government.
<P>But that was not the end of the story.  When the markets reacted in a positive way, and the appropriators fulfilled their commitment to our Nation, not only did we hit our target for a balanced budget, we came in $8 billion less than where we needed to be in order to reach a balanced budget in 2002.
<P>That is the story behind the story. We are $8 billion ahead of where we need to be in order to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002!
<P>This is great news, and I’m happy to deliver it to you, because it’s not often that you hear good news out of Washington.
<P>And there’s even more good news.  We’re on track to balancing the budget without raising your taxes.  We did not go back to the 1993 way of raising your taxes.  We’ve accomplished this by truly shrinking parts of this government.
<P>This Congress has kept its commitment to balancing the budget.  In the past, other Congresses have spent money hand over fist thinking that was the way to win over the voters.
<P>But this Congress understands that the best thing we can do right now for the American worker, and for our children and our grandchildren is to balance the budget.
<P>A balanced federal budget is a permanent solution to our Nation’s economic problems.  Never again should we give in to quick-fix gimmicks, election year charades, and snake-oil solutions.<P>
What does a balanced federal budget mean to you and your family?  It means:<P>
<ul><li>lower interest rates which makes it easier to buy houses, cars and other goods;
<LI>it means lower taxes;
<li>it means more jobs, lower unemployment, and fewer people on the welfare rolls;
<li>and finally it means higher salaries and more take-home pay to spend as you see fit.
</ul>Folks, we are winning! Is there more to be done?  Sure there is.<P>
But with your help, we can cut through the demagoguery of the other side and keep our focus on balancing the budget.  When we do that, we will return economic security to you, and a brighter financial future to your children.<P>

"A New Scenario for Dole"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
"A New Scenario for Dole"
<P>
Right now things are pretty grim in the Dole camp. As former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested yesterday, things will probably get worse before they get better because Dole is out of money. Moreover, because Bill Clinton was unchallenged in the primaries, he has millions to spend. Dole, on the other hand, remains mired in the muck of Senate procedures where the likes of Ted Kennedy can get the best of him.<P>
There is an alternative scenario kicking around which, if Dole can pull it off, would transform his campaign overnight. You will recall that the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment failed by a single vote in the U.S. Senate last year. It received the two-thirds majority needed in the House with votes to spare. But six Democrats who had previously voted for such an amendment suddenly switched positions and the Amendment went down to defeat. When that happened the whole push for the "Contract With America" went into the tank.<P>
The reason that some of the Democrats claimed they switched was articulated by Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota in two words: Social Security. Because the so called Social Security Trust Fund is considered on budget, the surpluses it presently produces are used to offset other government spending. Dorgan insisted that this does not offer enough protection for Social Security. In fact, Dorgan came off as some sort of hero in North Dakota because voters believed he had helped to save Social Security.<P>
Well, Republicans ought to just accept that argument. Taking Social Security off budget would mean that to achieve a balanced budget another $35 billion per year would have to be cut from domestic spending. Sounds good to me. Maybe we finally could eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, the National Endowment for the Arts, Goals 2000, Americorps, and other such programs which produce more harm than good.<P>
Right now, quietly behind the scenes, Dole and Illinois Democratic Senator Paul Simon, who fervently believes in a balanced budget and who would like to cap his Senate career by seeing such an amendment passed, are trying to see if the votes are there to pass a new version of the Amendment which takes Social Security off budget.<P>
It is hard to believe that Democrats would provide Dole with such an opportunity. However, the two North Dakota Senators, especially, were so high profile in their contention that they really did favor a balanced budget. If the Amendment got Social Security off the books, it may be hard for them to back away from the issue now.<P>
This new version of the Balanced Budget Amendment should be able to easily pass the House. And guess what? A Constitutional Amendment does not go to Bill Clinton for his signature. It goes directly to the states for ratification.<P>
Picture this:  there are now 31 Republican Governors and half of the state legislative houses are controlled by the Republicans. Imagine that Presidential candidate Bob Dole, now lacking money to run a regular campaign, would go from state to state urging the legislatures to ratify the Balanced Budget Amendment. It would highlight the fact that he was able to get such an amendment through the Congress; it would give the Republican Governors and legislatures a chance to showcase positive changes they are making in state government; and Dole addressing state legislatures would probably get live coverage in most of the states where it would take place.<P>
The Dole campaign, which is on the rocks in every way right now, could be transformed overnight into a positive force for an initiative which is supported overwhelmingly by the American people. There is little that Bill Clinton could do about it. Clinton opposed the Constitutional Amendment for a Balanced Budget when it was before the Congress. His liberal allies know that if such an amendment is in place, federal funding for many of their favorite programs becomes dubious at best.<P>
This scenario is probably too good to be true. My guess is that if Dole and Simon do come up with a Balanced Budget Amendment that satisfies the two Senators from North Dakota, a couple of other Democrats who had previously voted for the Amendment will switch to be against it on the grounds that removing Social Security from the budget will require cutting too much from domestic spending.<P>
As Peter Ferrara suggests in a column in today's Washington Times, Dole should then be commended for trying. In the off chance Dole would be able to make it happen, all bets would be off on the Presidential race. The chance to hammer home the fact that Dole favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and Bill Clinton does not, and make that case before state legislatures in very real and graphic terms, live and in person, would turn around the dour prospects for a Dole presidency.<P>

"Sacrificing Principle for Party Loyalty"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
How do I hate this town? Let me count the ways! For one thing, almost no one really puts himself on the line for what he says he believes in.<P>
Case in point. Majority Leader Dick Armey wears his conservatism on his sleeve. To hear him talk, you would think he is one of the most principled of men ever to grace the Leadership of either party. I am sure he thinks of himself as principled. But Dick Armey is a party man first and foremost. And as a party man he puts protecting incumbents ahead of principle.<P>
Congresswoman Sue Kelly is one such incumbent. She voted against many items in the "Contract with America." When the Leadership said last summer that the Labor HHS Appropriations Bill was Armageddon and twisted arms until they hurt with GOP members who were reluctant to vote for the bill, Sue Kelly defied the Leadership. Worst of all, Sue Kelly was one of five Republicans to vote with President Clinton against the partial birth abortion bill.<P>
Sue Kelly’s opponent in the GOP primary is former Congressman Joe DioGuardi. DioGuardi is famous for having been the candidate who retired Bella Abzug from the House of Representatives. DioGuardi, when he served in the House, was the only certified public accountant to ever to do so. It is DioGuardi who pointed to the irregularities of the House majority which Speaker Gingrich was pleased to pick up on when he took over a year and a half ago.<P>
DioGuardi would be a loyal soldier when it came to things such as the "Contract." He would never vote against the Leadership on a key appropriations bill. In New York’s multi-party system, DioGuardi already has the Right to Life party line. He would not be a dissenter on an issue like partial birth abortions. Yet Dick Armey, to help protect Sue Kelly, has gone so far as to call potential DioGuardi contributors in New York to ask them not to give to the DioGuardi campaign. Other members of the Leadership have tried to make the case for Kelly as well on the grounds that the GOP will lose the seat if she is not the nominee.<P>
First of all, if DioGuardi wins the GOP nomination and already has the Conservative and Right to Life party nominations, he will have an excellent chance of getting elected. But even if Kelly had the better chance of holding the seat, is incumbent loyalty worth sacrificing one’s principles? Is it worth helping someone who is so liberal that even partial birth abortion doesn’t stir her conscience? Is incumbent loyalty worth stabbing a fine upstanding man like DioGuardi in the back?<P>
Take the case of Congressman Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania. Speaker Gingrich gives passionate speeches about how the labor unions are out to destroy his Republican majority. Indeed they are and first among them is the National Education Association, the teacher’s union. When push comes to shove, Congressman Goodling, a former teacher, does the NEA’s biding inside the GOP caucus.<P>
Goodling, who was first elected to replace his father George Goodling in 1974, was challenged in the Republican primary by civic activist Charlie Gerow. Gerow ran because he wanted to join the likes of the eager young freshmen who have made such a difference in Congress. Goodling’s cozy relationship with the NEA was one of the key issues in the campaign. Well, who made an all-embracing appearance in the district for Bill Goodling at the strategic moment when it was clear it was a horse race? Why Speaker Gingrich, of course. <P>
When the results were in, Goodling was only re-nominated with a 53% to 47% vote. Gerow contends that if Gingrich had just stayed out, he would have defeated Goodling in this heavily Republican district. Then the NEA would not have had a mole inside the GOP ranks. But incumbent loyalty is more important to the Leadership than principle, when principle means standing up for those who believe the same things that the Leadership professes to believe.<P>
Perhaps one can morally justify neutrality on the part of the Leadership in such cases.  After all, members of the Leadership are put in a difficult position when one of their members is challenged in a primary. But all out support for incumbent members who are challenged by candidates of principle is next to impossible to justify if you really believe in the causes you preach to the faithful on a daily basis. No wonder the American electorate has grown increasingly cynical.<P>
Contrast this incumbent loyalty among Republicans with the Democrats. Congressman Ralph Hall of Texas is perhaps the most conservative Democrat in Congress. His voting record is better than that of most Republicans. A couple of times since he was first elected in 1980, Hall was perceived to be in trouble. He might have been replaced with a Republican. The Democratic Leadership was nowhere to be found. Hall was on his own. That is because Hall routinely votes with the Republicans on issues and defies the Democratic Leadership even on crucial votes. Their loyalty to liberalism was greater than their loyalty to one of their incumbents who votes against them. Even though Hall is a close friend of mine and I am glad he survived those challenges, I have to admire the liberals for at least standing for something.<P>
One possible Republican exception to this sorry state of affairs is Oklahoma’s freshman Representative Steve Largent. Late last year Speaker Gingrich sought to punish a group of conservatives because they didn’t cave in when he did on shutting down the government. Largent then stepped in and did the fund-raisers for those on whom Gingrich canceled out. It worked out well. The public would rather pay to see a star athlete like Largent any day over a Washington politician.<P>
What Largent did took real fortitude. But of course he is a freshman. Were he serving his ninth term like Gingrich or his sixth term like Armey, he might not be as eager to cross a member of the Leadership.<P>
There is a reason that many of us who used to be adamantly opposed to term limits are now among its most ardent backers. The longer I stay here and see good men like DioGuardi and Gerow stabbed in the back by supposed philosophical standard bearers such as Gingrich and Armey, the more passionate about term limits I become.<P>

"Making a Tax Cut Better"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
Last week, Wednesday, I was witness to a dialogue between a freshman Senator and a freshman Congressman. That conversation got to the essence of where this nation is going in fiscal terms.<P>
The Senator was John Ashcroft, the former Governor of Missouri. He was explaining his proposal to make social security taxes deductible. Such a tax cut would mean an average middle class family would save more than $1700 a year in federal taxes. The Ashcroft program would cost $35 billion for its first year and more than $50 billion each year thereafter.<P>
The Congressman was Wisconsin’s Mark Neumann, the single most focused Member of the House on the question of our national debt.<P>
Neumann asked how the Senator was going to "pay for this legislation in terms of spending cuts."  The Senator from Missouri was vague.  "We’ll cut some money from corporate welfare and we’ll get some money through welfare reform and from overhead expenses from the federal government," Ashcroft told the Congressman.<P>
"No, I mean specifically," Neumann replied. "What exactly would you cut and how much?"<P>
The Senator didn’t know. Neumann continued, "Look, I like tax cuts. I want to vote for this legislation. But I can’t vote for anything which will enlarge the deficit. Unless you know exactly what you are going to cut and from where you’re going to cut it, the bill will end up enlarging the deficit."<P>
The Senator was silent. Neumann was exactly right. <P>
I think the Ashcroft idea is a splendid one. It would provide a middle class tax cut in exactly the way it should be provided. I hope his bill gains traction. But the day has passed when any responsible legislator should propose any piece of legislation without giving specific consideration to what will be cut from federal spending if the legislation is passed. <P>
With trillions of dollars in off book debt and unfunded liabilities, not to mention the current budget deficit, we simply cannot afford to pass legislation without looking at the precise consequences of enacting such bills. We have been avoiding such consequences for the past several decades. Look where it has brought us.<P>
The correct answer to all this is that we should do both. We ought to pass Ashcroft’s bill, but Ashcroft should spell out precisely what portions of the federal budget he will cut out in order to make up for the lost revenue his bill would engender. Then we will have the best of both worlds. We will be giving a tax cut to the people who need it most, in the most equitable method possible. At the same time we will further cut federal spending in other areas so as not to enlarge the debt. All responsible legislators need to ask the questions Mark Neumann asked. Then we will truly be making progress. <P>

"Supporting Tyranny over Freedom"
</h2>
(Delivered by Brad Keena)
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
A 58-year-old, highly educated, and soft spoken freedom fighter is, as we speak, 
conducting a hunger strike in a Belarus jail. He is the victim of a Stalinist style 
crackdown which is taking place in the former Soviet Republic. 
<p>Yuri Khadyka’s crime is that he dared to speak out against the repressive and dictatorial 
regime of hard line Communist Alexandr Lukashenko. Lukashenko is trying to 
reintegrate his country with Russia without a vote of the people giving him authority to 
do so. Lukashenko admires Adolph Hitler and yearns for the return of a true Russian 
leader like Josef Stalin so that at least real order can be restored. 
<p>Among all of the former Soviet Republics, Belarus has made the least progress in moving 
toward democracy and free enterprise. Even in places such as Georgia, Armenia, and the 
Central Asian Republics things are better off than in Belarus. Lukashenko has suspended 
the parliament, even though his fellow Communists have a lopsided majority there. He 
does not want to give a forum to the few Democratic voices who serve in that body and 
that is where Yuri Khadyka comes in. 
<p>Freedom fighters are given no access to the media. Their voices in elected government 
have been silenced. The only alternative for them now is to take to the streets. But for 
doing so, Khadyka and a couple hundred organizers of a 30,000 person demonstration in 
downtown Minsk were arrested on April 26th. 
<p>Khadyka has not been allowed to talk to his lawyer. He may languish in jail for up to six 
months before there is any trial, if there is one. And in Lukashenko’s Belarus, the 
outcome of the trial will be a forgone conclusion, just as the trials of dissidents were 
foreordained in the former Soviet Union. 
<p>What is happening in Belarus is symbolic of what is happening in other places in the 
East. It is the prototype for what will take place if Communist candidate Gannady 
Zuganov is elected President in the upcoming elections. He has promised a similar 
crackdown on those regarded as opponents of the Communist ideology.
<p>To us, Khadyka is not just some remote figure we hear about in short- wave radio 
coverage of foreign developments. He is someone we know well. Bob Krieble and I have 
had lengthy discussions with him on several occasions. His son, 29-year-old Alexey, has 
worked for us at the Krieble Institute of the Free Congress Foundation for the past four 
years. He is one of the young, dedicated freedom fighters who have risked their lives to 
help promote freedom and democracy in the former Soviet empire. 
<p>Last Saturday night I was awakened in the middle of the night with news of the ominous 
developments in Belarus. Alexey pleaded for our help to get word of the plight of the 
Belarus freedom fighters to American officials. Well, our discussions with the State 
Department were exactly what you would expect. This Administration, while willing to 
involve itself in imposing a leftist government in Haiti, is unwilling to lift a finger to 
protest repression in Belarus. 
<p>The realities of the repression there do not square with this nation’s policy of the 
reconstruction of the former Soviet Union. Yes, the State Department wants to see the 
former Soviet Union re-established in some new form. Our officials think that will bring 
stability to the region. Yes, it will bring stability the stability of the graveyard. 
<p>While most of the other organizers who have been arrested in Belarus have now been 
released from jail, Khadyka remains there. He is a special problem case because he is also 
a Christian leader who has sought the return of the ancient Bylorussian language as well. 
Someone with his views is not convenient for the Lukashenko regime. 
<p>We have managed to interest some Members of Congress in what is happening in 
Belarus. Robert Novak devoted today’s syndicated column to this subject. Perhaps little 
by little we will bring world attention to the plight of freedom loving people in this small 
former Soviet Republic of l2 million people. 
<p>The issue here isn’t that Yuri Khadyka is a truly fine man, which he is. The issue here 
that the United States government is cooperating with pro-Communist forces in the 
reconstruction of the Evil Empire. That is not why our men and women died on the 
battlefield opposing tyranny in this long and bloody twentieth Century. This is not why 
countless more unsung heroes died during the Cold War.
<p>The time to speak up against this evil is now before it is too late. Failure to do so may 
well mean that the next Century will bring confrontation with a new evil empire all over 
again. Only this time, the outcome might not be the same.

"Washington’s Misplaced Perspective"
</h2>
(Delivered by Brad Keena)
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
	There is old adage that says "politics is like sausage – you don't want to know how it is made!"
	Considering this is an election year, each passing day is proving those words were inspired to describe Washington and its establishment.  Washington today is like a great big sausage factory.  Broadcasting here so close to the factory, we sense it all around us.  Even now, as I listen carefully, I can hear the haunting screams of ordinary citizens falling into giant tax machines ripping out their wallets; tossing what remains in huge grinders designed to pulverize faith and morality through the terrible engines of an unstoppable federal judiciary.  In the air this election year is the malodorous waft of this huge sausage factory we call Washington.  The mixture created in this factory is ghastly to look at until the Administration adds its coloring to give the final grind an appearance of being edible.
<P>	Like short-order cooks, the establishment media fries up this nasty glop into bite size bits, served on plates with ugly china patterns with names like HUD, Education, Commerce, and Labor.
The table is set before the hungry establishment elite competing in a sausage-eating contest – a game which will last until November.  No one at the table is willing to admit where the sausage came from, how it is made, or what's in it.  To admit this would cause each at the table to lose his or her appetite:  for the sausage has come from outside of Washington.  It has been scandalously and horribly made with the most vile additives.  Its ingredients include the faith and hopes and dreams of ordinary Americans.  Together the future of each has been reprocessed into morsels prepared for the gluttonous elite seated at Washington's table.
<P>	The machine grinds on.  The terrible sounds continue night and day.  The stench of this factory permeates the air.  Unending is the Establishment's voracious appetite for power over its citizenry.
Perspective is a remarkable thing.  As humans, we tend to get lost in the false perspective of seeming permanence.  Time is slow moving.  Often we think what we see at the moment is permanent, but we're wrong.  America did not always look this way.  We have allowed our own government to remove itself from morality's scale.  The courts have overruled God's moral measurements, the government has thrown aside God's ethical scales.  The true measurement is sure.  It's weight is exact.  It's precision remains for all time.  Yet our culture has chosen a perspective which avoids to close a look at the moral and ethical realities.  Don't ask, don't tell about homosexuality in the military; don't ask, don't tell about the murder of babies even moments before birth; don't ask, don't tell about a political process promising to deliver everything we want at the expense of everything we've got.
<P>	This is not America.  This is another nation.  It's capital has become the sausage factory.  
In the banquet hall, its king and his lords, his wives and his concubines are drinking the blood of society in silver vessels, praising the gods of the Establishment.  On one wall of Washington's terrible banquet hall is a great hand.  It is writing Washington's future, telling the measurement and weight of the moral scales society had allowed Washington to disregard.  The writing on this wall is becoming visible for all to see:  "Moral integrity has been found wanting. Days are numbered. The kingdom is about to become divided."
<P>	Meanwhile, the banquet continues.  The writing on the wall has gone yet unnoticed.  The Washington sausage factory drones on.<P>

"FDA Commissioner’s Arrogance"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
I have spoken before of the arrogance of the federal Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, in its constant effort to seize more power for itself. Further evidence of that arrogance just keeps on building. <P>
The Washington Legal Foundation has filed a First Amendment lawsuit against the FDA, challenging the agency’s crackdown on the dissemination of information regarding the "off label" uses of FDA approved drugs and medical devices. The Washington Legal Foundation lawsuit contends that the FDA’s restrictions violate the First Amendment rights of both the providers and the recipients of such information. <P>
Federal law currently prohibits the manufacturer of an FDA approved drug or device from specifying on the product label any uses of the product other than the precise use approved by the FDA. However, doctors are free to prescribe FDA approved products for uses other than those specified by the product label. In fact, in many areas of medicine, most of the treatment recognized by the medical community consists of off label uses of FDA approved products. <P>
Recently the FDA has begun a crackdown on manufacturers who become involved, in any way, in the dissemination of information about the off label uses of their own products, such as distributing to doctors’ medical text books which contain information about the off label drug uses. The Washington Legal Foundation suit contends that this is a violation of the First Amendment which effects not only the producer of the product but also the recipients, first the doctor and ultimately the patient. <P>
Commissioner David Kessler of the FDA refused to appear at a scheduled deposition on April 24th. The legal foundation is trying to depose Kessler in order to, in its words, "establish that he was personally responsible for the FDA crackdown and that in directing the FDA to implement its no policy, he gave no thought to whether the crackdown might violate free speech rights." Washington Legal Foundation’s lawyers claim that senior FDA officials deposed to date in the lawsuit have admitted that First Amendment concerns played no role in their policy deliberations. The foundation contends that it needs to depose Kessler as well to establish that he too was oblivious to First Amendment rights in formulating agency policy.<P>
Well, Kessler was a no-show. Instead he filed a motion to quash the deposition which Federal Judge Royce Lamberth will rule on shortly. Such a move on Kessler’s part is unprecedented. "It is outrageous that Commissioner Kessler thinks he is above the law and not subject to the same litigation rules as anyone else who gets involved in a lawsuit," said the Foundation’s Chief Legal Counsel Richard Samp. Samp pointed out that even Bill Clinton has had to give a deposition in connection with Whitewater and the First Lady has had to appear before a grand jury in connection with the White House travel office. <P>
Samp contends that Kessler said one of his top priorities as Commissioner would be to crackdown on the off label uses of FDA approved products. Never mind that people are being cured by these products. Never mind that such products are recognized as the only possible remedy in some medical cases. What the FDA seeks is total control. <P>
That attitude was reflected in a very personal letter former Congresswoman Marilyn Lloyd  sent to some Members of the House. The Congresswoman from Tennessee served in the House for 20 years before retiring after the 1994 elections. Marilyn Lloyd told her former colleagues that she had undergone a mastectomy in 1991 and had chosen silicone breast implant surgery. But just before her surgery was to take place the FDA ruled that such operations could not go forward. <P>
Mrs. Lloyd contends that the FDA made this ruling with no scientific evidence that such implants were harmful. She quotes Dr. John E. Woods, vice chairman of the Department of Surgery at the Mayo Clinic as saying, "Instead of protecting the health and concerns of women, this moratorium caused undue stress and anxiety for women with implants and women who wanted them around the world." Mrs. Lloyd told the Members of Congress to whom she wrote, "I want you to understand that the irresponsible nature of the FDA’s decision has led to real women – mothers, wives and daughters – dying needlessly." <P>
Again the issue here is one of control. That is what David Kessler and his agents are all about. Control over other peoples’ lives. <P>
There is more and more evidence that the FDA is a government agency totally out of control. This Congress owes it to the long-suffering American public to take the steps necessary to tie Commissioner Kessler’s hands.  Congress must do this before more innocent people die needlessly because they are unsuspectingly caught up in one of Kessler’s little power games. <P>

"House Speaker Cultivating Challengers"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
These are not the best of times for Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. First, he was savagely attacked by New York Senator Al D'Amato who claimed that Gingrich had misread the 1994 elections and thus had proposed radical initiatives instead of the incremental changes the voters wanted. Now comes word from inside the House that some Members are talking seriously about challenging Gingrich for the Speaker's post in the next Congress.<P>
The challenge comes not from the dozen or so hard-core conservatives among the freshmen who have never cared much for the Speaker. Rather, the challenge comes from an outer core of less-adamant conservatives. One multi-term Member told me he knew of at least two candidates who were considering the run. All of the current members of the leadership strongly back Gingrich and are opposed to any run against him.<P>
This whole issue is relevant only if Republicans keep control of the Congress, because in the event they become a minority, the Republicans will lose one leadership position and Gingrich has already said publicly that he would drop out in such a case.<P>
The rap against the Speaker from those who want an alternative is two-fold. First, his opponents claim, he plays games on crucial issues. There is now a dispute, for example, between the Speaker and Majority Leader Dick Armey over the minimum wage issue. Armey says he doesn't want to vote on the issue at all because the minimum wage is part of the Democratic agenda. Gingrich points to a letter he received from 38 "moderate" Republican Members of the House who back the Minimum wage.  He says a vote on the issue is inevitable and so he wants it brought to the floor with Republican provisions attached. <P>Conservative opponents of Gingrich claim that he actually encouraged the "moderates" to write the letter to him in the first place. They quote one of their colleagues as telling them "I didn't want to sign the letter (on the minimum wage) but Newt asked me to." Their claim is that this is all too typical of how Gingrich operates, pitting one side against another. Moreover they contend that when liberal Republicans bolt the party line, nothing is said to them at all. But when conservatives disagree with Gingrich they are taken to the woodshed, cursed at, and told to get in the real world.<P>
The second rap against Gingrich is that he is often unfocused and flits from issue to issue. The Gingrich opponents claim that the Speaker all but abrogated his responsibilities earlier this year, telling the other House leaders they were going to run the show while he concentrated on strategies to get Bob Dole elected President and to raise money for the Republican party.<P>
Opponents think they have a chance to defeat Gingrich because of the dissatisfaction among the current freshman class as well as the fact that a number of older Members were never fond of the one-time fire brand in the first place.  In addition, they believe, incoming freshmen won't have the kind of attachment to the Speaker that this class once had.<P>
As I see it, the challenge to Gingrich, when all is said and done, probably won't work. I think his adversaries ought to step back and look at the situation and then take some action.<P>
First off, they should acknowledge that Gingrich is without peer in proclaiming a vision for their party. It is a party which otherwise lacks vision.  They should be reluctant to toss overboard the one person they have in their midst who has that capability.<P>
Second, they should call the Speaker's bluff when they think he is playing games with them. Newt is, above all, a realist. If he knows he can't get by with the sort of tactics which enrage his opponents he won't try them. The next time they get "woodsheded" for doing the right thing, they should go public with the issue. In such cases, the vast majority of ordinary folks will be with Members trying to do the right thing, not with the Speaker. This is part of Newt's style. Last year, for example, a delegation from Focus on the Family visited the Speaker expressing extreme discomfort at the direction of the Republican party. Gingrich told the delegation if he were in their position, he would threaten a third party. This is exactly the way Gingrich operates.  If things like that become a public issue, the Speaker is not likely to continue down the same path.<P>
Finally, these conservatives should look for someone among their ranks to fill the shoes of Vin Weber and Bob Walker. When Newt Gingrich first came to the Congress back in 1978, he was extremely unfocused.  As a result, he was not taken seriously by his colleagues. Mr. Weber, a former six-term Congressman from Minnesota, recognized great potential in Gingrich. So did Rep. Walker (R-PA), the watchdog of the House floor. Together, they gently but firmly took Newt's hand and helped to organize and focus him. They were an integral part of his success. But Mr. Weber left the Congress in 1992.  Rep. Walker is leaving at the end of this term. Both need to be replaced. Speaker Gingrich came to trust them and rely on them even though initially they were not the best of friends. I would suggest that conservatives disgruntled with the Speaker try to become to Gingrich the kind of assets that Weber and Walker were.  This would afford them the type of positive influence over the Speaker that these two Members had.<P>
Most challenges to Republican leadership figures turn out to be just talk. This challenge, although being discussed by serious Members of the House, will likely also turn out to be just talk.  That is, unless of course, the Speaker himself performs in such a way that he drives Members into the arms of his opponents.<P>

"The Real Solution to Illegal Immigration"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
"The Real Solution to Illegal Immigration"
<P>
The Senate has passed an immigration bill by a 97 to 3 margin. The bill is similar to a measure which has already passed the House. President Clinton is signaling that he will sign the bill. So our worries about immigration are over, right?<P>
Sorry, but I've heard this one before. In 1986, the same Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming who guided this bill through the Senate, assured us that immigration was going to be under control because employers would be required to verify that a prospective employee was in the country legally. The measure didn't work. It did, however, increase the number of illegal documents in circulation.<P> 
This bill does contain some provisions which have merit. The bill doubles the number of officers on boarder patrol. It also provides for enforcement of the measure, which has been on the books since 1882, regarding legal immigrants. A sponsor is supposed to guarantee that the person he brings to this country will not be on the public assistance rolls for five years after coming here. Since the 1960's that provision has never been enforced. A combination of court decisions and lenient administrations have caused the law to be ignored. This bill gives that measure some teeth if an Administration has the courage to use it.
<P>The legislation also contains a provision for a pilot program to create new documents that would be difficult to copy.  However, one of the bill's chief sponsors, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), was unable to answer how such a law would keep the new documents out of the hands of those who misrepresent themselves to authorities.
<P> All of this aside, this bill is utterly meaningless without true welfare reform. Welfare reform has been twice vetoed by this President. The reason some immigrants come here is to work. Fine. If they are taking jobs Americans won't fill, I don't have a problem with that. But many illegal immigrants come here for our welfare benefits. Unless, and until, it is clear that we as a society can deny welfare benefits to anyone who is not here legally, no beefed up boarder patrols or document controls are going to mean very much. 
<P>Pass genuine welfare reform and watch the flow of illegal immigrants dry up to manageable proportions. Don't pass welfare reform and watch this bill fail the way the immigration reform bill of 1986 failed. It is almost that simple. 
<P>

"Mayor Should Heed Friend’s Advice"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
It is an American tradition that local politics is always more colorful than national politics. So ordinarily the strange wanderings of a Mayor would not be suitable for a commentary with a national focus. But when it comes to the Mayor of the nation's capital, it is another matter. <P>
Marion Barry is a national, indeed, international figure. So when the Mayor suddenly leaves town for a retreat in St. Louis to reconnect with God and his spirituality, it is news. It is news, even more so, because one of Mayor Barry's closest friends, Rock Newman, who headed up the "Rock The Vote" effort for Barry to return to office in 1994, has now called on the Mayor to resign. The Mayor isn't denying that this is a consideration.<P>
Now, Marion Barry is still recovering from prostate cancer. He has had alcohol and drug problems in the past. He served six months in jail for a charge related to the use of cocaine. His subsequent election as alderman and then comeback as Mayor was called the political miracle of the century.<P>
I am not trying to pile on here. But it was Marion Barry's aides who called the news media in the middle of the night to tell them to show up at the Baltimore airport at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday for a Barry press conference.  The press arrived only to have the Mayor tell the reporters that they should leave him and his wife alone. He was headed to St. Louis to a retreat house. On the surface it is very confusing; but since just about everyone else in this town is offering an opinion about what is happening to the Mayor, I shall offer one of my own.<P>
For decades now, Marion Barry's faith has been in government. Even as a young radical agitator he was always trying to get the government to spend more on his people. He upset the city's establishment in getting elected Mayor. When he did so, he greatly expanded the city government. Marion Barry became a hero to many because he was able to put them on the payroll. His liberal friends in the Congress blessed him with every sort of experimental federal program imaginable. They gave Barry control over billions of federal dollars with which to put more people on the payroll. None of these programs was ever monitored very closely.<P>
Washington, DC, was the laboratory of liberalism. If you needed help, the Mayor had a taxpayer-supported program for you. It worked for a time. But as is the case with all solutions which are not based in reality, the fix was not permanent.<P>
Marion Barry knew the heights of power. While in prison he knew the depths of powerlessness. He vowed he would come back and indeed, five years after he was released from jail, he was back at City Hall. But what the Washington, DC, Mayor came back to was not the same place he left. The consequences of his liberal programs had come back to haunt the city. The population was down. Crime was up. The deficit was high. Private sector jobs were low. New federal programs were out. Federal control over Barry's budget was in.<P>
The politics Marion Barry had practiced so well over so many years had ground to a halt. The Mayor, who was used to solving a problem by giving someone a taxpayer supported job no matter what their skills or productivity, was now virtually powerless to act. He was presiding over a city with sharply increasing problems; a city which no longer could be run by the whims of its Mayor. It was run by tough regulators determined to bring spending under control.<P>
Marion Barry's total faith in government had brought him to this dead end. That is the making of a spiritual crisis. At such times, even people who have disregarded most of what the Bible teaches will turn to the Scriptures. I believe that what is causing at least some of the Mayor's problems is the realization that he has placed his faith in the wrong place. Bigger government did not bring salvation.<P>
Facing the ruins of what once was a well-ordered city, Marion Barry cannot come to grips with reality. Even after the Republicans took over the Congress and made it clear the city was going to have to shape up, Barry went on acting as if nothing had happened. Committee Chairmen and even the minority Democrats on Capitol Hill accused the Mayor of engaging in fantasy. He did not want to believe that the way things had been for decades was now at an end.<P>
The Mayor has come face to face with the real world and he doesn't like what he sees. It doesn't conform to the untruths he has sold himself and his followers. The world as it really exists, which Mayor Barry now confronts on a daily basis, is really an unpleasant place. The instant gratification solutions Barry has applied  all these years are no longer available. 
<P>I wish the Mayor well in reconnecting with God. I hope this time it is the true God and not the gods of liberalism who have been enshrined in Washington these many years. Meanwhile the Mayor would be well to heed the advice of  Rock Newman. The nation's capital could use new leadership that has the ability to cope with the new realities.<P>

"Republicans Should Stick to the Issues" 
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
There is no doubt that Bill Clinton is on a roll. His latest poll numbers show him with an unprecedented 21-point lead over presumed Republican nominee Bob Dole. That poll doesn’t even take into account what will happen if, as is likely, Ross Perot runs again and splits the anti-Clinton vote.
<P>All of the dire predictions which many of us made about Clinton’s foreign policy adventures, especially our involvement in Bosnia, have thus far not come true. For a President who said that domestic issues would be his primary focus, Clinton seems to be making quite a name for himself in the Balkans, in the Middle East, in Russia and  elsewhere.
<P>And while the economy isn’t exactly bustling along, growth is probably just adequate enough to prevent electoral problems for the President.
<P>Then there is Whitewater and associated problems. Whitewater was supposed to draw Clinton a primary opponent. It did not. He is the first Democrat since FDR not to have one. he President just made a three-and-a-half-hour videotaped interview for the criminal trial of James and Susan McDougal and Governor Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas. They are the three charged with conspiracy and fraud in the Whitewater affair. The text of the tape will be released but not the tape itself because the White House believes that Clinton opponents would try to turn the tape into a 60-second commercial.
<P>Whitewater has been in the news since before Clinton took office and yet it has failed to effect the standing of this President. My co-hosts and I debated this on last night’s Campaign ‘96 show with Mark Levine of Landmark Legal Foundation. Levine believes that Clinton is in for big-time trouble down the road on Whitewater. I disagree. I think if, as is probable, Gov. Tucker gets acquitted, Whitewater will be over and done with. To pursue it after such a verdict will simply appear too partisan. Republicans would run the risk of a significant backlash.
<P>The polls show that a majority of the people in the United States believe that the Clintons are hiding something. But the same polls show that the majority doesn’t care. The question is why don’t they care? Well, first off Whitewater is too complicated to understand. The public will not be interested in this case unless and until there is something simple which they can relate to. They understood Hillary and the cattle futures issue. They understood the Watergate break-in. They understood Chairman Rostenkowski’s misdeeds. They don’t understand this case. Secondly, whatever the Clintons did, it mostly took place before he was President. True, Vice President Spiro Agnew was driven from office by what he did as Governor of Maryland. But most voters want to know what Clinton has done while President, not something which happened a decade and a half ago. Thirdly, the voters today are cynical about politicians. There is no shock value to the notion that a politician and his wife might be in this game to get something for themselves. In fact the public believes that all politicians are similarly guilty.  Since it is presumed, guilt that is confirmed just doesn’t have that much of an impact.<P>
Yes, of course, there is the media which made a national cause out of John Sununu getting dental work while on official business. But the media has not covered Whitewater with any intensity. Still, I can’t fault the national media on this one as I have done on many other issues. After Clinton came into office, hundreds of Pulitzer Prize seeking reporters swarmed into Little Rock seeking to break the story that would bring this President down. They did that, not because they disliked Clinton, (most of them voted for him) but because it would bring them more power. Some journalists really worked at it for months going on years, and with unlimited expense accounts. They simply never found the smoking gun.
<P>Looking at Clinton’s standing with the voters, some Republicans are hoping against hope that Whitewater will turn into something to rescue their fortunes. They are foolish to count on it. If it comes at all, it could well be after this President is re-elected.
<P>I have said from the beginning of this case that I didn’t think it would impact politically. Republicans, I suggested, would be well off to make the philosophical case against liberalism and the Clinton Presidency. If something does come of Whitewater they will get an added benefit but meanwhile the 1996 election would be about real issues which matter to the American people. They have not done so. And now they are reduced to hoping that one of Clinton’s friends will drop something sensational at the Whitewater hearings or that somehow the jury in Arkansas will find Governor Tucker guilty. Thus the reality is that Bob Dole cannot win the Presidency. Only Bill Clinton can lose it. That has never been a winning strategy to gain power in this country. Even if the Republicans do take power under these circumstances, they do so without any mandate to change anything.
<P>It is the ninth-hour and the sun is nearly setting on this election season. It is still not too late for this election to be about opposing philosophies and clear differences on issues. If that case is made, Whitewater won’t be needed. If something substantive relating to Whitewater does break between now and the election, it will only underscore the philosophical case which has already been made. It remains to be seen now if, at least, conservatives will stick to the issues this year instead of waiting for the political equivalent of the lottery known as Whitewater.<P>

"Defending Caesar Against God"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
The Capitol today is filled with believers who are praying for their country. Although the "Washington for Jesus" rally did not live up to the crowd expectations of its promoters, it is nevertheless impressive to see that thousands of people are willing to take time off to come to their nation's capital to ask God's blessing on this land. 
<P>Indeed, it will take the intervention of the Almighty if this nation is going to reverse its course. Yesterday's hearings on assisted suicide, chaired by Rep. Charles Canady of (R-FL), pointed to another tragedy for the nation which is coming at us with thunderous speed. Yet hardly a whimper is heard about it from the nation's religious leaders. <P>
Saving this nation will be up to ordinary people. History is replete with examples of religious leaders who were either silent in the face of great moral crises or who actually cooperated with those inflicting moral crimes on the nation. I am not indicting all religious leaders here. There were a few leaders who did stand up to be counted at the moment of truth and there are some today. But usually those leaders are bucking the trend.<P>
Yesterday some 30 so-called religious leaders from Protestant and Jewish denominations sent President Clinton a letter backing him on the partial birth abortion veto. They wanted to give the President cover for one of the worst decisions ever made by an American President. Clinton's decision even earned him a particular denunciation by the Pope, something which almost never happens. But these Church leaders, including the presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, have seen fit to tell the President he was right in vetoing the bill. They defend Caesar against God.
<P>White House staffers say that the President has actually profited from his stand. The latest Gallop poll, taken after the President's veto, shows that Bill Clinton is leading Bob Dole by the largest margin ever, 58% to 36%. Thus, they claim, the President has done the right thing because the people back him. 
<P>Well, as I said, the ordinary folks, including the generation-X contingent who raised their hands in prayer on the mall today, are the people who will help turn this nation around. They are speaking out against the moral outrages of our time. The "Washington For Jesus" rally held a mock trial with secular society and its deadly sins as defendants. One of the teenagers wore a T-shirt which read, "I fear no evil because He is with me." Indeed, it is evil which stalks the land.
<P>When a six-year-old boy kills a two-month-old child, it is the product of evil. Yet in our time, we scarcely acknowledge evil. In fact, we attempt to turn evil into good. A new movie called "The Craft" attempts to glorify witchcraft. One of the stars of this movie says that all she is trying to do is to show that there is power all around us of which we are unaware. Yes, the power of death. All of these events happening in today’s society have something in common. They are all a part of the ancient struggle between life and death. This struggle dates back to when God put man on earth.
<P>Today, however, death has more advocates. Death has the apologists. Death, whether by killing the unborn, or killing the terminally ill, or killing innocent bystanders with guns, or seducing the innocent through witchcraft, or by a thousand other means, death is triumphing over life in contemporary society. But God is life. So what the cult of death really translates to is a rejection of God. 
<P>Don't expect this nation's government or religious leaders to give the principle of life the upper hand. That will depend on the prayers of not only those who could show up in Washington today, but the prayers of all believers, of all faiths, wherever they are in this nation.  In the end it will depend on those who are willing to stand up and intone that ancient refrain, "Choose Life. Choose Life."<P>

Revolution?
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
Last year at this time the new Leadership in the House of Representatives spoke boldly of "revolution." Speaker Gingrich especially insisted that business-as-usual was out; fundamental changes in the way that Washington does business were in. When some of us suggested that the Senate and President Clinton were unlikely to go along with such changes, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston retorted, "President Clinton is irrelevant and the Senate doesn't matter. Not one dime can be spent on a single program unless the House of Representatives okays the spending." Known as the One-House Veto strategy, this was the way Republicans were going to force an end to programs which they considered bad for the country.
<P>What a difference a year makes. Speaker Gingrich may have fun cavorting with Jay Leno or acting as substitute host for "Larry King Live," but these days there is no talk of revolution. The rest of the Republican Leadership tries to put a happy face on what happened with the budget process, but it is hard for them to do. As for Chairman Livingston, he doesn't much like to answer questions on the One-House Veto strategy. 
<P>That is because on substance Bill Clinton won just about everything he fought for in the fiscal year 1996 budget which was finally approved by Congress. Americorps, which is a device to pay volunteers to be active in politics, supporting Clinton and his friends, is still with us. The National Endowment for the Arts, despite its subsidies for pornographic art, is in the budget. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, despite its ability to earn billions by marketing its own products, gets subsidized for a longer term than even budgets approved by Democratic Congresses. The Legal Services Corporation, which over the years has done more harm than any other single federal program I can think of, is alive and well. Goals 2000, which is an attempt to federalize education and to impose "outcome based" methods on local school districts survived because Bill Clinton fought for it and the Republicans were unwilling to stand up and fight against it. The Commerce Department, Department of Education, and even HUD are still with us.  
<P>I could go on and on, but you get the picture. It is true that this budget does cut more money from discretionary programs than even the Republicans had proposed when they first put forth their seven-year balanced budget. So in that sense, the Republicans have a right to some credit. They are actually ahead of where they said they would be in reducing the deficit and getting the budget into balance, which is a little-known fact completely lost in the national debate.
<P>The bad news is that the federal programs the Republicans sought to kill have been funded and will be funded again in the 1997 budget. If Bill Clinton is re-elected and if the Democrats take over Congress, as well they might, these programs will grow again and be right back where they were. True, most of them have been significantly reduced under the newly-approved budget, but the bureaucrats don't care. As long as they stay alive, as long as the infrastructure stays intact, they can survive to fight another day. That is why the freshmen Republicans wanted to pull these programs up by their roots. That is why they proposed eliminating three or four cabinet departments. 
<P>I am not faulting the Republicans because these things didn't happen. The fact is that one election simply isn't enough to turn a nation around which has been heading in the opposite direction for seventy years. What the Republicans should be blamed for is not waging an all-out fight to accomplish the ends which they originally sought. In the process of such a fight they probably would have managed to get half again as much as they got. But even if they didn't, the public would understand what the 1996 election is about.
<P>Elections are best for the country when there are clear-cut differences between the parties. Now everything is fuzzed up. Both sides are claiming credit for the budget. Under these circumstances Bill Clinton and Congressional Democrats win hands down. 
<P>It was said of Bill Clinton that he didn't really believe in anything. Indeed, if you follow his rhetoric, he is masterful in appropriating the themes of his opponents. "The era of big government is over," intoned the President in his "State of the Union" speech. But Bill Clinton fought, and fought hard, for liberal federal programs. He fought on principle. He got every single thing he fought for in one way or the other. I haven't even mentioned the wholesale Republican retreat on environmental issues. 
<P>The problem here is that one side was willing to go all out to win. The other side was embarrassed by what it was fighting for. The Republicans didn't want to defend killing the Endowment for the Arts because too many upper class suburban women gave them a hard time. They didn't want to defend killing the Legal Services Corporation because they heard from too many Republican lawyers who were afraid they would get stuck with more pro-bono work. They didn't want to defend cutting off the government subsidy for PBS lest they see one more bumper sticker proclaiming that Newt killed Barney. 
<P>In short, they didn't have the stomach to face down their opponents. Bob Livingston was right. If the House had stood its ground, none of this would have happened because not a penny can be spent by a President which doesn't get money from both houses of Congress.
<P>The voters are going to take it out on the Republicans for their cowardice because it was they who built up expectations to an unreasonable level. The sad thing is that the freshmen, most of whom fought the good fight even against the wishes of their own Leadership, are likely to get hit the hardest by the voter wrath. And when that happens, the assumption will be made that cutting back federal programs is anathema with the voters and cannot be attempted again. 
<P>No Greek drama or Middles Ages morality play ever had a more tragic ending. 
<P>

"Senator Cochran’s Exemplary Actions"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
On occasion, there is honor among politicians and it is worth our taking notice. Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi is Chairman of the Senate GOP Conference. It is one of the top leadership positions in the Senate. He is sort of the Chairman of the Board of all Republican Senators. He has a significant staff. He has occupied the position for six years and no one has even hinted about running against him for that leadership position in the next Congress. Cochran is a shoo-in for a fourth term in the Senate this November.<P> 
But Thad Cochran helped freshmen Senators engineer term limits for the Senate Leadership and Committee Chairmen. As part of a reform package, it was adopted by the majority at the beginning of the 104th Congress last year. Cochran was one of the very few senior Senators to have assisted the freshmen in getting the reforms they sought.<P>
The term limits for Leadership provision grandfathered Cochran and others so the six year time clock would not apply to them for another couple of Congresses. But Thad Cochran is an honorable man. Having been a chief proponent of six year term limits for the Leadership, and his six years as Leader being up at the end of this Congress, Cochran announced that he will not seek re-election as Chairman of the Conference.<P> 
Thus Cochran sets the sort of example inside the Senate which Senator Malcolm Wallop set in 1994 in Wyoming. Wallop was an ardent opponent of term limits. However, the people of Wyoming voted for term limits by more than 70% of the vote. Their vote also grandfathered Wallop, who didn't agree with the outcome, but he felt the people had spoken so he announced that he would abide by their will and retire. That forced the hand of his colleague Alan Simpson who also announced his retirement from the Senate, after three terms, at the end of this Congress. <P>
Cochran's announcement was a thunderbolt in the Senate. Here is a Senator who is actually putting into practice what he says he believes. Cochran's actions will likely effect what other Senators, who have been in the Leadership for many years, will do as well. <P>
One can only speculate what it will mean for Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. If Dole loses the Presidency, the question of his continued leadership in the Senate will be front and center. Dole was first elected Leader following the 1984 election. He has been either Majority Leader or Minority Leader ever since. 
<P>Cochran's principled actions will put Dole in a box. Even though the reforms passed by Senate Republicans specifically exempt the Majority Leader, will Bob Dole, should he lose the Presidency, dare to come back to his colleagues and say, "Others are leaving after six years, but I want my job back for the 13th and 14th year?" I frankly doubt, now that Cochran has done what he has done, Dole would get by with it. For Dateline Washington, I'm Paul Weyrich.

<h2>
The Independent Council
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

When Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh was busy harassing witnesses over Iran-Contra during the Reagan Administration, Democrats cheered. As Independent Counsel Ken Starr conducts his Whitewater trial in Little Rock, Republicans cheer.<P>
What of the ordinary Americans who are not part of the established political parties? Well, in my opinion, they have little to cheer about when it comes to the way the Independent Counsel system functions. It is a system out of control.<P>
In reality, Independent Counsels are accountable to no one. Lawrence Walsh spent $40 million of taxpayers’ money, obligating his victims to spend millions of their own money defending themselves. For this he got a couple of forced convictions which probably would not have taken place had Walsh's targets not panicked and agreed to plead guilty. The Independent Counsel, investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, went so far afield in his investigation that he even drew a rebuke from the federal judges who appointed him. <P>
I know that Republican partisans are hoping against hope that Independent Counsel Starr will get convictions in Arkansas. However, there is every indication that Governor Tucker, at least, will be found not guilty and that the Starr investigation may collapse thereafter. Meantime, Democratic Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and John Breaux of Louisiana have called on Starr to resign because of alleged conflicts of interest in his private law practice. Among the charges that these Senators and others make is that Starr represented the Bradley Foundation in a Milwaukee school choice case and the Bradley foundation has provided funds for, among other entities, NET. NET, after all, doesn't approve of much of what the Clinton Administration has done. What many think about the work of Independent Counsels depends upon whose ox is being gored.<P>
Against this background, Congressman Jay Dickey, a Democrat turned Republican from Arkansas, has introduced legislation which would require that after two years the Independent Counsel would be subject to the usual oversight process of the Congress. Such counsels would have to come to the Appropriations Committees to seek a renewal of their funding. Moreover, the Dickey legislation would require that Independent Counsels drop outside legal work while serving in that capacity.  This would prevent accusations of conflict of interest.<P>
Dickey's bill is getting a lot of favorable coverage in Arkansas because it is seen as a slap at Ken Starr. But, in fact, Dickey has made it clear that he has high regard for Starr and does not think the charges of conflict of interest against him are meritorious. Dickey is moving on a principle here. He believes, as do I, that no one should be above our system of checks and balances.
<P>Right now Independent Counsels have a blank check to spend as much as they want for as long as they wish. Their mandate is limitless so they often conduct fishing expeditions at the taxpayers’ expense. Those of us who believe in a rule of law know very well that our Founding Fathers would have a collective heart attack if they saw this system in operation. 
<P>Dickey's bill should be approved by this Republican Congress. The Democrats would have to vote for it. Senate Democrats certainly could not filibuster the legislation after what they have said about Ken Starr. President Clinton, thinking he will be re-elected, will eagerly sign the legislation.
Regardless of who is in power, this bill is necessary because it will end the highly dubious status of these Independent Counsels who have no accountability.
<P>Two years is enough time to pursue a valid investigation if there is substance to charges being made. In that case, an Independent Counsel will have no problem justifying his work and even a partisan Congress, under pressure from the media, will have to continue an appropriate level of funding. 
This legislation restores some badly needed balance to the system.
<P>The problem here is that some in the Republican Leadership rather enjoy seeing President Clinton and his associates twisting in the wind. They have forgotten what it was like to have Lawrence Walsh on his rampage. Now they've gotten their pay-back at the expense of Bill Clinton. But a pay-back in reverse may be coming with a vengeance if Bob Dole gets to be President. 
<P>No partisan advantage is worth the distortion to our constitutional system which the Independent Counsel system represents. This Congress should immediately pass the Dickey initiative. In fact, Dickey's bill doesn't go far enough for me. The whole system should be repealed. But since the votes aren't there to accomplish that, at least the Dickey bill is a step in the right direction. If the Republican leaders have any sense of integrity they will act on the Dickey measure forthwith. 
<P>

"Republicans Have Lost Their Vigor"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>These are dark days for the Republicans.<P>
<ul>
<LI> Speaker Newt Gingrich says his party is in a funk.
<LI> Former Cabinet Secretary Bill Bennett says that the campaign of GOP Presidential nominee Bob Dole is uninspiring and unfocused. Bennett suggests that Dole step down as Majority Leader. 
<LI> Liberal attacks on Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr have begun to take hold. The Democrats believe they can now blunt the effects of any convictions which might come out of the current Arkansas trial as well as any revelations from concurrent Senate hearings. 
<LI> Democrats in Congress unite to defeat any and all significant Republican initiatives on any legislation, leaving Bill Clinton in the driver's seat. 
<LI> The respected political analyst Charles Cook now says the Democrats have a one-in-three chance of recapturing the Congress, something which would have been unthinkable six months ago. 
<LI> Organized labor is spending huge sums of money targeting freshmen Republicans on the minimum wage through radio and TV commercials. No comparable spending is countering this from the Republican side.
<LI> Talk show host Rush Limbaugh, one of the most reliable parties supporting Republicans on the air, now says he may file for a trial separation from the Republican party because he doesn't want to be associated with people who are unwilling to stand up and fight for what they say they believe. 
<LI> All polls now show Bill Clinton leading Bob Dole by double digits. Polls also show Democrats in the lead for Congress. 
</UL>
<P>As I say, these are not happy times for Republicans. Rush Limbaugh is on to something. The problem here is not that the electorate has suddenly turned liberal. The problem is not that the so called mainstream media is more vicious than they were during the 1994 election season, for example. The problem is not that the liberals suddenly have a set of ideas which have captured the imaginations of the American people. The problem is not that times are so good that it is inevitable that the incumbent President will win. 
<P>The problem is simply this: The Republicans have lost all passion for their beliefs. A year ago, as they worked through the Contract with America, Republicans fought for their ideas with great conviction and the public was with them. They did so, it turns out, because they were dead certain that Bill Clinton would collapse from the momentum they had started. Republicans had but one battle plan: force Clinton to surrender, then declare victory and go on to the next triumph. 
<P>But Bill Clinton did not surrender. In fact, Bill Clinton rallied his troops. There seems to be a lot of passion left in those who believe in big government. The Republicans collapsed, not Bill Clinton. The Republicans began to compromise and compromise and compromise. The more they gave in, the more the Democrats united in the Senate to stop Republican initiatives. The more the initiatives died, the less the Republicans wanted to continue fighting for them. Now all the intensity is on the side of the Democrats who smell the chance to come back to power in a major way. 
<P>Republicans, meanwhile, are paying lip service to a host of good ideas in which they once insisted they really believed. These range from term limits to cutting out harmful federal programs to medical savings accounts. The problem is that there is no passion behind their rhetoric. They give their supporters little to get excited over. Compare what is happening today to the fight the Republicans waged against Bill and Hillary's health care plan in the 103rd Congress. The intensity back then was all with the Republicans. 
<P>So what happened? What happened is simply this. The mainstream media attacked the Republicans vigorously. Some among their ranks couldn't take the heat. They urged compromise. Republican leaders tried to appease this group through compromise. Democrats, upon hearing of proposed compromises, sensed weakness and decided to go for the jugular. 
<P>Then came the 1995 off-year elections. Republicans lost them. Fear and panic swept their ranks. They offered more compromise, emboldening the Democrats, who managed to get themselves together after having been badly split last year. Republicans, then, all but threw in the towel on a variety of issues, demoralizing their own troops. This, combined with a bruising Republican primary season where all the passion and excitement was with the losing candidates for President, brought us to where we are today. 
<P>Limbaugh is essentially correct. If the Republicans don't want to go all out to fight for their ideas, if they don't want to stand up and defend themselves, and if they don't want to be on the offensive instead of the defensive, then they do not deserve the blind loyalty of Limbaugh or anyone else. Defeat is not inevitable. But as any good coach knows, to win on the playing field you have to believe in your own team. If the Republicans don't believe in their own ideas enough to fight for them, then they shouldn't be surprised when people who believe in contrary ideas, no matter how wrong they may be, end up trouncing them for good. 
<P>If the Republicans keep going where they are going, they will give Limbaugh one more chance to say, "See, I told you so." 
<P>

"Liberal Media Bias"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>

<P>
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich said yesterday that if the news media really believes so much in affirmative action, they should hire conservative Republicans. Gingrich was reacting to a Freedom Forum study, released by the Gannett-sponsored organization last week, which demonstrates that reporters covering politics and government are predominately liberal. 92% voted for President Clinton, as compared with 43% of the population as a whole. 
<P>
The study reveals something else, however, which is in my view, even more disturbing. It highlights the overwhelming cynicism of the national media toward anyone serving in office. This cynicism is especially pronounced, no doubt, when reporters cover politicians with whom they disagree.
<P>When I worked in the newsroom of a major metropolitan daily during the 1964 Presidential campaign, the reporters were overwhelmingly for the re-election of Lyndon Johnson. In fact, out of a staff of close to 100, I found only four supporters of the Republican nominee, Barry Goldwater. Editorially, the itself supported Goldwater, but the reporters who covered the campaign were against him. <P>

I have to say that, by and large, the professionalism of this group of reporters overcame their bias. Goldwater got fair coverage from the Milwaukee Sentinel despite the views of the reporters covering him.  When President Eisenhower got such a thunderous ovation at the 1964 GOP convention in San Francisco for criticizing the media, he was referring to columnists and editorial writers, not news reporters. Eisenhower suggested that lots of people were giving advice to the Republicans -- pundits who would, themselves, never vote for Republican candidates. The delegates roared their approval. 
<P>Today, the situation is reversed. In most papers the majority of columnists are from the center-right point of view. Even dedicated liberal papers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times have conservative columnists. Where those who believe in limited government, free enterprise, a strong national defense and traditional moral values take it on the chin is on the reportorial side of the equation. The people who cover the news are no longer taught, as they were when I was a reporter, that their personal opinions are not to show up in their reporting. <P>

The change came during Watergate. Prior to that time, there had been a small group of advocacy journalists who had made their way into America's newsrooms. They were in conflict with the traditional journalists who believed that their responsibility was to cover news, not to make news. When the Washington Post brought down the Nixon Administration, the advocacy journalists had won the day. Traditional journalists could no longer prevail because what the advocacy journalists had accomplished was to make the media a fourth and most powerful branch of government. 
<P>From that time to the present, the cynicism of journalists, many of whom do not hide their point of view, is overwhelming. They begin with the presumption that politicians, especially ones with whom they disagree, are guilty. All that remains is for them to identify the wrong the politicians have done. 
<P>
It is inconceivable, in the minds of these reporters, that the freshmen Republicans who got elected in 1994 actually believe in something and want the country to change. Rather, the reporters believe these freshmen have to be serving some special interests. They must be fronting for big money. Or at the very least they are serving their own interests. 
<P>It is not only a liberal bias, but this cynicism, which makes for the sort of coverage that has caused Speaker Gingrich to tell supporters that over the next six months they must become "personal radio stations" to overcome the bias of the media. The preference for liberal and Democratic politicians was in the newsrooms more than 30 years ago. What is different between now and then is that editors back then insisted that personal views be kept out of the news pages. This didn't always happen, of course, but the bias was subdued. Today the bias is blatant. 
<P>The only cure for this in the long run is the market place. Newspapers are in a state of steep decline. Each time new ratings come out, network television has lost some additional viewers to rival cable or direct broadcast channels. At some point, the owners of these media properties will stop being in a state of denial and will begin to examine their coverage. It is then that they may insist once again that advocacy journalism is for opinion columns and commentaries. 
<P>So when reading newspaper coverage makes you so angry you can't see straight, or when watching television news makes you want to smash the set, contribute to the growing market forces which will change the system. Don't buy the paper. And turn off that channel. There are other sources of news. The more you patronize the other sources instead of the ones which distort reality, the sooner the owners of the so-called mainstream media will be forced, for their own economic well being, either to change things or get out of the business.<P>

"Earth Day' its Own Religion"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>

<P>
Thirty-two years ago today, two momentous things happened. Our first
daughter, Dawn Ceol, was born and the first "Earth Day" was proclaimed.
There is no connection between the two, I can assure you, although Dawn has
shown a lot of interest in gardening of late. <P>
It is true enough that we human beings have been given custody of earth and
that we should take appropriate care of what has been entrusted to us. 
But it is also true that in the Book of Genesis, it is clear that man was
given dominion over the earth. There was not a word from God suggesting that
we should preserve everything just as it was created. Quite the contrary,
God gave man an intellect and the ability to develop the earth.<P> 
Rather than a call for us to be responsible, as we continue to make progress
in unlocking what God knows anyway, "Earth Day" has become an ideology or a
substitute religion. The underlying assumption behind this ideology is that
the earth was created in a pristine state and it is man who is the problem.
If only we didn't spoil the earth with our use of resources, then we could
live in the beauty of nature again.<P> 
No one defends the real polluters. No one suggests that all businesses or
individuals have been completely responsible or even efficient in the use of
natural resources. But the idea that we are the problem is a direct denial
of God's word in Genesis. And that is the heart of the conflict over "Earth
Day." <P>
While not all who celebrate this occasion have adopted that philosophy,
those who have created the occasion have a neo-Pantheism at the heart of
what they believe. They worship not the God of creation, but nature itself.
These views are hardly new. We have evidence of similar ideas going back to
ancient times. Since nature is to be elevated, and man is to be subject to
nature, of course private property becomes an outmoded concept.<P> 
Nature, so many of the "Earth Day" advocates believe, cannot be confined to
a single individual but belongs to us all. Private property flies in the
face of this ideology. So behind the niceties of celebrating the beauties of
the natural state of the earth is an attack on the individual and his
rights. Thus it is fair to say that most so-called "Greens" are only green
on the outside. At the core they are red or at least pink.<P> 
When all is said and done there is little difference between what the
radical elements of the "Earth Day" movement believe and what the Marxists
teach. I say teach, because if you have ever visited a Communist nation you
will note that the reality is in stark contrast to Marxist beliefs. This is
especially true about the environment. At all of the international meetings,
the Communists were always pushing the Green agenda. Yet they left their own
nations in environmental ruins. <P>
So on this "Earth Day," while mindful of the importance of taking good care
of what has been entrusted to us temporarily, I prefer to celebrate Dawn's
birthday instead. She has been an outstanding example of what it means to
develop one's God given talents. I'd rather trust Dawn and her good husband
Ed to do good things with the property they own, then to put my trust in an
ideology which defies not only the Scriptures but reality as well. So Happy
Birthday, Dawn. Now get busy in your garden.
<P>

"Another Off-Book Mistake"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>


Congressman Bud Shuster (R-Pennsylvania) led a successful effort in the House of Representatives to pass his Truth-in-Budgeting bill by a vote of 284-143. The Shuster measure takes the Transportation Trust Fund out of the budget. This presumably would release more of the money collected through transportation taxes to be spent on local roads and other projects. On the surface that seems fair enough. People pay taxes on gasoline and airline tickets and the money should be spent for projects relating to their taxation.
<P>
The problem is that the transportation trust funds are used to offset other spending in the federal budget. So, in effect, this move means that another $30 billion will have to be cut from discretionary domestic spending to balance the budget if the Shuster measure should become law. That is why Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-Ohio) and Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R-Louisiana) strongly opposed the bill. "We will never eliminate the deficit if we give some programs exalted, protected status," Livingston said.
Another opponent, Rep. Chris Shays (R-Connecticut) said, "While some call it the Truth-in-Budgeting Act, I would call it the Unbalanced Budget Act of 1996 or frankly the Pork Barrel Bill of 1996."
<P>
Shays and Livingston are correct. Even this strongly conservative House of Representatives couldn't bring itself to eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or the National Endowment for the Arts. That being the case, who is going to seriously suggest that this Congress or a subsequent Congress is going to come up with another $30 billion in domestic budget cuts to balance the budget?
<P>
This is just another attempt to hide spending off-book. As Harrison Fox of Citizens for Budget reform has pointed out, the off-book obligations of the federal government are greater than those of the federal budget and in many cases more dangerous because they are hidden from the public. I have complained about the Senate stopping most of the reforms which the House has passed in this Congress. Well, this is one time I hope the Senate doesn't go along with what the House has passed. 

<P>
In theory, Congressman Shuster is right. In practice, this measure would be a disaster and would move us that much further away from ever bringing our budget into balance.

<h2>Smut assault forces return to censorship</h2>     
<br>By <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>I remember the first time I saw a dirty picture as a child. I was babysitting a neighbor's kids in the apartment building where I lived and spied a pin-up calendar hung inside an open closet door. I recall being scared to close the door, lest anyone remember it had been left ajar, and too timid to take a closer look, in case either parent returned unexpectedly. Little impression of the picture itself remains: a buxom blonde in Li'l Abner costume, breasts partially exposed.
<dd>Such innocent times. I thought of that picture again recently on a trip to Manhattan. I was tired after a long day of meetings and speeches and decided to spend the evening in my room at the Yale Club, ordering in room service and mindlessly watching TV. Unlike most hotels these days, the Yale Club offers no in-room movies, just basic cable service. 
<dd>Too lazy to cross the room and examine the TV Guide, I used the remote to move from channel to channel looking for something to watch. Shortly after 10:00 PM, my channel surfing swept me into unchartered waters. Suddenly I was staring at writhing, naked bodies: three young men, black and white, one wearing only a studded dog-collar; another, a gold cross hanging between his pectorals. 
<dd>I saw more. Simulated sex acts, close ups of tumescent genitals and other body parts and most memorably, the faces of the men, boys really, barely older than my children. After a few minutes, I switched the channel, unable to watch anymore, not even to try to learn what program it was I had happened upon. 
<dd>As shocking as the experience was, I'll survive this unwanted brush with gay pornography. But what about children or adolescents who happen to tune in? And they will, especially those who are already most vulnerable, whose parents aren't around or don't care what their kids are up to at 10 o'clock at night. What effect will those pictures have on the young? 
<dd>After this episode I learned that the cable franchise in New York City has tried unsuccessfully to limit this channel to those customers who send in postcards requesting it, free of charge. A federal district court judge considered this imposition too onerous, stigmatizing those with pornographic tastes. Apparently the judge did not feel it too burdensome to require parents to learn to program their cable boxes if they wished to keep images of sodomy off the family TV. He issued an injunction prohibiting the franchise from blocking the channel, which now remains part of the basic service that
comes into every cable subscriber's home. 
<dd>In his new book Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline, Robert Bork suggests that maybe it is time to re-instate censorship in America. "From the earliest colonies on this continent over 300 years ago, and for about 175 years of our existence as a nation, we endorsed and lived with censorship," Bork argues. That changed dramatically in 1973 when the Supreme Court in Miller vs. California established new standards to determine what may be banned. Courts since then have been reluctant to ban any sexual material as long as it involves "consenting adults." 
<dd>Barely 50 years ago, Bork reminds us, the Supreme Court unanimously wrote: "There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or 'fighting' words." 
<dd>How far we've come since then. Now the First Amendment is regularly invoked to protect as "speech" forms of expression that include "snuff" films that depict the sexual torture and murder of women and children, photographs and videos of men and women having sex with animals, and other abominations too numerous to mention. 
<dd>It is unimaginable that our Founders would have sanctioned this interpretation of the First Amendment, which after all was intended originally to protect political speech deemed necessary for democracy to function, indeed thrive. Are we a freer society today by virtue of being exposed to all manner of filth and smut? Are our children more likely to grow up good, informed citizens ready to perform their democratic duties because they have listened to a steady stream of misogynist and hedonist rock and rap lyrics on the public airwaves? 
<dd>Unless the Supreme Court can see its way out of the morass it has created, maybe it is time to consider amending the First Amendment. Twenty-five years of radical First Amendment jurisprudence on pornography has turned much of the popular culture into a Styxian cesspool. And those of us who would like to avoid being drowned there are told we are anti-democratic. 
<dd>Why must I carefully avoid scanning television channels, or pretend I don't hear the suggestive words emanating from the radio when I take a taxi? Why must I look at sneering, crotch-clutching models in their underwear on the side of city buses? And how am I expected to protect my children if I choose? 
<dd>Surely liberty is not synonymous with licentiousness. And if judges cannot tell the difference, the people will have to show them the way, which is what real democracy is all about.

<h2>Silence of the Lamm</h2><p>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a><p> 
<i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>

So, is America ready for a third-party?  Ross Perot thinks so.  So 
does David Broder of the Washington Post, who writes that by 2000, a 
third party will be a major political force in America.
<p>
But if there were a third party, what would it stand for?  What would 
its policies be?  These are the questions bothering the third party we 
already have - Ross Perot's Reform Party - because to date it is a 
party of one man, not a party of ideas.  If it is going to have any 
impact on the American political process, the Reform Party must become 
a party of ideas.
<p>
Take the case of former three-term Colorado Governor Dick Lamm, who is 
trying to get his message out to members of the Reform Party in a 
effort to win the party's nomination for president.  So far, he has 
had only moderate success
<p>
Lamm contends that the Reform Party, founded and largely funded by 
Perot, has hampered his campaign by refusing to let him have members' 
addresses so that he could reach them by mail.  In addition, his 
repeated requests to debate Perot were declined.  Reform Party 
officials deny having done anything to hinder Lamm's campaign or his 
ability to reach party members.
<p>
Lamm stepped into the Reform Party process for two reasons:  He wanted 
a national platform on which to discuss the problems American is 
facing and he apparently believed Perot when for months the Reform 
Party founder denied having any desire to be nominated and run for 
president of the United States.
<p>
Unfortunately, the national media have focused almost entirely on the 
internal struggle for power rather than the issues Lamm and the Reform 
Party have been pushing.  As a result, Lamm's message has been 
silenced.
<p>
But were he able to get his message out he would warn Americans of a 
number of impending problems.  For example:
<p>
<b>Social Security reform</b> - The Social Security system is going bankrupt.  
At its current rate of growth, the trust fund will begin drawing on 
reserves by the year 2013 and will be broke by 2030.  Since our 
elderly population is growing much more rapidly than workers, there 
simply won't be enough workers to keep Social Security solvent.  The 
later we wait, the worse it will be, so we must develop a solution 
now.
<p>
<b>Medicare reform</b> - Medicare is going bankrupt even faster than Social 
Security.  According to Medicare's trustees' report, Medicare Part A 
(which pays hospital bills) will go into the red by 2000 and be broke 
just a year or so later.  Republicans passed a Medicare reform 
proposal, only to have it viciously attacked by the Democrats.  As a 
result, the notion that Medicare is politically untouchable is 
prevailing once again.  That's an attitude we can't financially 
maintain for long.
<p>
<b>Fiscal responsibility</b> - Reagan-era tax cuts increased federal revenues 
between 1981 and 1989 by an average of 1.8 percent per year, after 
inflation.  Unfortunately, the Democrat-led Congress increased 
spending by 2.3 percent.  That disparity explains the increased 
deficit spending during the Reagan years.  Bob Dole wants to cut 
taxes, but keep the budget balanced.  Would Lamm do the same?
<p>
The problem is that Dick Lamm has spoken out on these and a number of 
other issues over the years, but the media have focused so much on 
Lamm's political struggles, they have failed to give due attention to 
his solutions to our problems.
<p>
That's too bad, because Lamm is a serious politician with a message 
Americans need to hear and consider.  His may indeed be a "root-canal" 
vision of our future - all cuts and no gains - but it is a very 
definite political message that may force the Republicans and 
Democrats to deal with politically difficult issues that candidates 
might otherwise sweep under the table.
<p>
I don't believe Lamm's message will resonate.  Americans are 
optimists, believing, in Steve Forbes' words, in "hope, growth, and 
opportunity."  Lamm's pessimism will be a hard sell.  Further, I would 
disagree with those who say there is a political longing unfulfilled 
by the Democratic and Republican parties.
<p>
To have an impact, third-party candidates will need to debate the 
message, not the man.  So far all we've heard is Ross Perot.  Maybe 
it's time to see what Dick Lamm has to say.  
<p>

 <i> September 4, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>Brown v. Board of Ed, Pt. II</h2><p>


<i>If you're sick and tired of judicial activism, take heart. It may not last much longer.</i><p>



"We are constrained by many rules and taxed for many costs that we as self-governing people did not choose for ourselves but were chosen for us by judges who thought they knew better," observes Richard Morgan, professor of Constitutional Law and Government at Bowdoin College. Writing in the Summer issue of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, Morgan argues that the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education "ushered in the modern era in constitutional law," an era in which the courts came to be viewed "as a source of governmental power that could force unpopular changes that could not be secured through representative institutions." Over the last three decades, the courts "have removed issue after issue from the arena of popular decision and subjected them to judicial control."<p>

Morgan laments the dramatic changes that have taken place in America since the 1960s, "when judicial social engineering based on the Brown model took hold. Huge new bodies of judge-made law constrain us on all sides," he observes. "New restrictions on what Americans can do in their communities, state legislatures, and the national Congress are being fabricated apace. It is no accident that this period of imperial expansion by the judiciary coincides with a period of precipitous increase in the American social problems and a decline in the quality of life, especially in our cities," says Morgan. "The courts did not cause the decline, but they often have made it more difficult for communities, through the processes of self-government, to cope with their problems. In the decades since Brown we have seen our churches and other voluntary institutions . . . increasingly isolated from the public square; we have seen our schools destabilized, our law enforcement enfeebled, the maintenance of order in our streets undermined, and major public-sector institutions taken over and run by judges."<p>

There was no popular support for such judicial abuse in the beginning, nor is there any now, and yet it continues. "After decades of conservative electoral outcomes and hundreds of state and federal judicial appointments intended to end 'judicial legislation,' and with public opinion sullenly resistant to much of the social engineering ordered from the bench, how is it that legally unjustified judicial interventions into policy making and administration still occur routinely?" asks Morgan. "Why does our sprawling 'rights industry' continue to grow and succeed so often in persuading judges to establish policies that cannot be put in place through the normal democratic processes of election and legislation?"<p>

Though leaving such questions unanswered, Richard Morgan insists that the days of judicial activism are numbered. He argues that "curtailing judicial legislation is an absolutely essential part of reinvigorating self-government and arresting social decline in America at the end of the century." The best way to begin, says Morgan, is by recognizing the error in Brown.<p>

<h3>Defending Gingrich</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 23, 1997 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Where have all the great leaders gone?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	That's a question I've heard many times. My answer is: It's not that America no longer produces great men and women. It's that our political and media establishments no longer revere the qualities that make for greatness. They even turn on greatness when it threatens their complacency.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I would submit to you that no one poses a greater threat to the complacency of the Washington establishment than Newt Gingrich, narrowly re-elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, and leader of a noble campaign to get Washington off the backs of American families and workers. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ever since young Congressman Gingrich had the temerity to challenge then-House Speaker Tip O'Neil in the 1980s, the Washington establishment has had it in for Gingrich. It comes as no surprise that the business-as-usual crowd eventually drew blood.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's not just that Gingrich favors balancing Washington's checkbook, lessening the burden of taxes on American families, giving authority and autonomy back to states and localities, and giving all Americans greater economic independence by reforming welfare, Medicare and Social Security (three of Washington's biggest power-grabbing programs).  

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's that he has forced President Clinton to sign on to all of these objectives, albeit in different forms, which cut at the heart of big government. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Say what you want about Gingrich. But he believes his ideas passionately, pursues them relentlessly, and is willing to take a beating for it. When all the smoke clears, he frequently comes out on top. By contrast, Americans still are trying to figure out what the occupants of the White House believe.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To the Washington establishment, Gingrich is clearly the devil. His 104th Congress eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices and projects. It enacted farm and telecommunications reform, changing antiquated laws dating back to the Depression. The 104th Congress also reduced discretionary domestic spending by $53 billion. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	His revolution is rolling. It wasn't repudiated by the voters in 1996 as liberals believed it would be. The 105th Congress is on the brink of truly ending the era of big government and re-instituting the era of citizen-directed self-government. Bill Clinton was re-elected because he sang Gingrichisms like a canary: lower taxes, balanced budgets, family values.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How did Gingrich pull off this victory? By being the lightning rod and taking the heat. Like any great leader, he recognized that since his cause was just, the only thing his opponents could attack was himself. Accepting this, he didn't buckle, and while his enemies attacked, the victory was being won.  And more victories lie ahead.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Heck, Newt Gingrich even admits and apologizes for his mistakes! By contrast, can you imagine hearing  an admission of guilt or an apology -- about far worse "ethical lapses" than anything even dreamed of by Gingrich -- from other key players in Washington? 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"We are at the end of a 60-year cycle of liberalism," he said recently before The Heritage Foundation President's Club. "We had to have at the national level a great debate about where we were going. And that debate was a confrontation with those on the left who still believe in redistribution of wealth, centralized bureaucracy, command-and-control planning."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With so much at stake, someone had to take the heat. According to some polls, Newt Gingrich is now one of the most unpopular men in America. But when was the last time you could look at a national leader and say, "Here is someone willing to suffer public humiliation for doing what is right?"

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is one leader who deserves another look

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Fumento:Crime Rate Decline Calls for Introspection--and Caution</title>

<i>January 22, 1997</i><p>
<h2>Crime Rate Decline Calls for Introspection--and Caution</h2><p>     
<P>
<dd>
Hallelujah! Praise the lord and DON'T pass the ammunition!  Why?  Because across the
country, murder rates are plummeting. According to new FBI figures, the rate fell 7 percent
in the first half of 1996, continuing a three-year trend.
<br>
<dd>     
The down side of this is that next to other western countries, the United States is still 
comparable to a World War I battlefield. Whatever we may be doing right, we need to be doing
a lot more. But what ARE we doing, anyway?
<br>
<dd>     
First, let's make clear that anybody who says there's a simple or complete answer is either
lying to you or to themselves. That includes the claims of Sheriff Wild Bill Clinton that he
done rode them varmints outta town on a rail.
<br>
<dd>
"Crime has dropped in the last four years as we worked to put 100,000 police on the streets,"
he said in his January 4 radio address.  He has also repeatedly given credit to the Brady
Bill, which requires a waiting period and background check for handgun purchasers.
<br>
<dd>
But note Clinton's careful wording about those cops. He said he worked to put them there, not
that they actually exist. Indeed, for the most part they don't. Studies show that at most
the legislation has added about 17,000 new officers, and many of those would have been added
anyway but are now simply paid for out of federal funds instead of local ones.
<br>
<dd>
As to the Brady bill, Mrs. Brady humbly boasted at the Democratic National Convention that
her husband's namesake law "has helped keep more than 100,000 felons and other prohibited
purchasers from buying handguns."
<br>
<dd>     
Actually, the White House itself has only claimed 60,000, and a General Accounting Office
report last year found that half of those rejected were for administrative reasons--mostly
paperwork errors. Only 5 percent were rejected because of violent crime convictions and most
probably just proceeded to buy a gun on the streets.
<br>
<dd>
Thus, a University of Chicago study found recently that the Brady Bill was about as effective
as "The Brady Bunch" in preventing crime.
<br>
<dd>
The main way we know that neither Clinton nor anyone in the federal government deserves
credit for falling crime is that about 95 percent of crime is handled by state and local
agencies. That's easily measured, because about 95 percent of the criminals behind bars are
there on state charges, not federal ones.
<br>
<dd>
So what were some of those state and local initiatives that might have helped reduce violent
crime?
<br>
<dd>
One was pointed to in the aforementioned University of Chicago study, which found a direct
correlation between the increasing number of states allowing people to carry concealed
firearms and decreasing violent crimes in those states.  Apparently, many criminals start
rethinking their careers when they realize their next potential victim may exercise his or
her constitutional right to blow their attacker's head off.
<br>
<dd>
The Chicago study made gun control advocates so hot you could have fried eggs on their
heads. Nevertheless, they were unable to refute the data, which showed that when such laws
went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults
fell by 5 and 7 percent, respectively.
<br>
<dd>
On the other hand, the major city with the highest drop in murders, New York, has no such
provision for carrying concealed weapons.  New York may be reaping the benefits of what
criminologist James Q. Wilson has called the "broken glass" effect.
<br>
<dd>
Basically, this means officers take the time to follow up on and prevent even the little crimes
like vandalism that formerly they ignored in favor of concentrating on big crimes. By paying
attention to lesser infractions, the theory goes, the police instill respect for the law and
uphold values in neighborhoods. This then cuts down on the occurance of major crimes.
<br>
<dd>
Clearly something wonderful is happening in the Big Apple, and the broken glass theory
deserves continued application and observation.
<br>
<dd>     
A steady rise in prison capacity may also be helping to reduce violent crime rates.
Since 1980, the nation's prison population has tripled.  Just in the last two years, the
population of state and federal prisons has increased by almost 14 percent.  In the last
four years, the average time served for serious crimes increased by a half.
<br>
<dd>     
In 1994, of those seeking parole, almost 80 percent were denied.  By contrast, in 1990 80
percent who sought parole got it.
<br>
<dd>
But before we wear out our palms slapping ourselves on the back for the decreasing crime
rate, a little humility and caution are in order. Without doubt, one major factor has simply
been a decline in the portion of the populace that is at the age that commits violent
crimes.
<br>
<dd>
Further, to listen to highly respected criminologists like Dr. John Diulio at Princeton
University and David Kopel at the Independence Institute in Colorado, we may just be in the
eye of the storm.
<dd>
The reason?  "It's not just the age of the population, but the conditions under which
it was raised," Kopel explains.  And more and more of our kids are being raised without fathers. 
Without fathers, young men don't turn to Hillary Clinton's "village," to raise them; they
turn to gangs and criminal activity. 
<br>
<dd>
"In 2010 we may be reaping a whirlwind from the family-wrecking policies of the  70s, 80s,
and  90s," says Kopel.  I pray he's wrong.  I fear he may be right.

<h2>
The American President
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Kathleen Howley
</a>

<P>
Everyone needs a hobby. Mine is trying to figure out the way Liberals 
think. Every time I think I have it nailed down, though, the Liberals 
pitch a curve ball.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Take, for example, "The American President," the movie about a highly 
paid female lobbyist who has an affair with the widowed President of 
the United States.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To Liberals, she's an "old-fashioned girl," because, after all, she 
waits until the third date to spend the night at the White House. Not 
the first date, mind you -- she's no tramp, after all. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president's young daughter gets wind of the ongoing affair. She 
approves, as it turns out. When the relationship becomes public and 
some Angry White Male Conservative senators object, they're dismissed 
as being "intolerant."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course, the simple solution to the controversy is for the president 
and his girlfriend to get married. It would shut up the big, bad 
Conservatives, and, since it's an election year, it would also give 
the president a boost in the polls. The whole country would fawn over 
the newlyweds. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, it never comes up. The word "marriage" is never spoken -- not by 
the Conservatives, as they plot their election coup. Not by the happy 
couple, as they snuggle in front of the fire at Camp David. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's the part that's hard to understand: Liberals perceive the 
president -- a character modeled, obviously, on a spiffed up version 
of Bill Clinton -- as a man of integrity, despite the bad example he 
sets for his daughter. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That view becomes apparent in the final scene, when the president 
makes a dramatic stand in defense of Liberal environmental 
legislation. Yes, I could almost hear the Clintonites sobbing in 
admiration. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How could a character with no moral backbone be portrayed as being 
honorable? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's the same question I was left with at the end of "Primary Colors," 
the anonymous account of the Clinton campaign.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sure, Gov. Jack Stanton (read: Clinton) sleeps with every female in 
sight. Sure, he impregnates the teenage daughter of a friend. Sure, 
he's a pathological lier.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He really CARES about America, though. And that makes everything all 
right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, Mrs. Stanton/Clinton is no slacker when it comes to 
extramarital affairs. According to the book, she sleeps with Henry 
Burton, alias George Stephanopoulos. But, that's dismissed as merely 
being "campaign sex."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the end of "Primary Colors," Gov. Stanton/Clinton is presented with 
some under-cover dirt on his opponent. Leaking it to the press would 
secure the primary nomination. But, it's just dirt about sex and drugs 
-- nothing really bad, from a Liberal's perspective. Should he use it? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of his aides tells him, "We don't do this sort of thing. We're 
better than that." In the end, Stanton/Clinton decides to take the 
high road.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once again, I could almost hear the Liberals weeping in admiration. 
What a man of courage! What a leader!  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It explained to me why there have been no denials forthcoming from the 
White House about the book -- no statements of shock or dismay. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You see, to Liberals, it's a relatively positive portrayal. Yes, the 
candidate has a fatal flaw in his inability to be faithful to his 
wife. But, that doesn't really count. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He refused to engage in "dirty tricks." And that makes him a hero. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You might ask yourself: how could two groups of Americans -- Liberals 
and Conservatives -- view the same events with such a radically 
different interpretation? How can Liberals dismiss sexual morality 
from the mix, when deciding who has integrity and who doesn't? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More to the point, how can the Liberal-dominated media lionize 
characters who have such obvious flaws? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's because the Liberals are working from a different set of rules. 
And, as long a politician doesn't break the Liberal code of 
conduct, he's a man of integrity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In short, they follow Ten Commandments, too. But, they're a bit 
different from the code that has guided Christians through the 
millenniums. The Liberal version is: 
<p>
<ol> 
<li>) Thou shalt be nice, except to people who are Conservatives. 
<li>) Thou shalt be inclusive, except to Conservative views. 
<li>) Thou shalt ignore the Lord's Day, unless you are a politician and 
need a "photo op" as you exit a church. 
<li>) Thou shalt blame thy mother and thy father. 
<li>) Thou shalt kill the old, the sick, and the unborn, but 
passionately defend the lives of death row criminals. (Unless you're 
an election-year politician who wants to look "tough on crime." In 
that case, kill them all, including the criminals.) 
<li>) Thou shalt commit adultery, and engage in any other mode of 
sexual expression, with any gender. But, thou shalt not feel guilty. 
<li>) Thou shalt steal, if it helps to re-distribute wealth. 
<li>) Thou shalt lie, if it furthers the Liberal cause. 
<li>) Thou shalt covet thy neighbors wife. 
<li>) Thou shalt covet thy neighbors goods. 
</ol>

<h2>Setting an Example</h2> 
<i>Jan. 3, 1997</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

I usually refrain from commenting on people before they have been formally charged, but the recent news regarding Michael Irvin has me thinking -- Is there anyone in the public eye left that our children can look up too. 
<P>
It seems that wherever we look, another athlete or movie star has had another run-in with the law. Whether it is Irvin's cocaine problem and the latest rape incident, or the late Snoop Doggy-Dog with his gangster lifestyle, our children are witnessing the demoralization of America first hand.  Each time one of their favorite stars fall, a child must lose a bit of faith in humanity. It must be an incredibly confusing experience for a young child to see the man, who's image is plastered all over their bedroom walls, taken away in handcuffs.
<P>
Even I, as an adult, was affected a few years back, when I heard that Magic Johnson was living a lifestyle that exposed him to HIV.  Events such as these affect more than just the participants - they seem to cheapen our society piece by piece.  It has gotten so bad that most parents wouldn't want their children to grow up to be President.  For our society to be at the point where the office of the Presidency isn't highly respected is a sad commentary on our country.  
<P>
NBA player Charles Barkley, who often gets into trouble on the basketball court, likes to say that he doesn't have to be a role model.  Baloney.  Being a role model is not something one chooses, but being a good role model is.  As long as we inhabit this earth, children will look up to and emulate those they see on television.  Athletes and other celebrities must just accept this responsibility along with the millions that get paid by the parents of these children.
<P>
Some athletes have accepted this responsibility.  Jim Harbaugh, quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, always starts every interview following a victory with the words "I want to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."  This is something that my children should be respecting - a man who has succeeded in sports and still understands his priorities.  The opposite, once again is exemplified by our favorite good Samaritan, Michael Irvin.  After winning the Super Bowl, he was on national television swearing and using the f-word with frequency.   I was completely embarrassed to be watching such a disregard for common courtesy.
<P>
Parents already have a difficult task in raising their  children.  They don't need to compete with Michael Irvine and his flamboyant lifestyle. The sad thing is that Irvin and the Cowboys might just win it all again this year.  Wouldn't that be a great lesson to teach our children?

<h2>Small-Business Agenda Faces an Uphill Battle</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<P>
<hr><P>



What happened to the year of small business?  In 1995, the 104th Congress 
championed a legislative agenda to foster entrepreneurship and small-business growth.  But 
advancing small-business legislation proved to be more difficult than most Washington observers 
expected.  Many of the issues that were priorities of the small business lobby were labeled by the 
Clinton administration as giveaways to the rich or special breaks for big business.<p>
For example, efforts to reduce capital gains and estate taxes have been decried as 
benefitting a special few.<p>
And legislation that would have made federal government regulators more accountable to 
small business has been portrayed as a legislative license for big corporations to pollute the 
environment.<p>
Even when Congress and President Clinton eventually sign off on a budget agreement, 
incentives that were specifically targeted for small business will be vastly watered down or 
tossed aside in the name of compromise.<p>
What can small businesses and entrepreneurs expect from Congress and the Clinton 
administration in 1996?<p>
Election years tend to produce a stale legislative environment so the answer may very 
well be "not that much."  On the other hand, the president may attempt to solidify his traditional 
base of support during the election year by offering proposals that translate into votes at the 
ballot box in November.<p>
For example, the president's inclusion of a federal minimum wage increase in his budget 
plan represents an olive branch to labor unions, which view the administration's stand on labor 
issues as weak.<p>
In Congress, business proponents  --  mostly Republicans  --  will continue to advance 
issues popular with the small business community.  Important matters to small businesses, such 
as overhauling the nation's tax system as well as tax and regulatory reform in general, will 
continue to generate scores of congressional hearings and legislative proposals in Capitol Hill.<p>
When push comes to shove, though, will small business see substantive reforms?<p>
The Small Business Survival Foundation recently revisited the agenda set forth by nearly 
1,800 small business delegates at the June 1995 White House Conference on Small Business.  
The following is an update on the top five recommendations that came out of that conference:<p>
<b>Issue No 1:</b> Independent Contractor Clarification.  Most small businesses believe the 
IRS's 20-factor test to determine the employment status of independent contractors is too 
subjective.<p>
  Republican Jon Christensen of Nebraska introduced legislation to clarify the definition 
of independent contractors and streamline the current 20-factor test to only three criteria.<p>To date, the House Ways and Means Committee has not acted on the legislation, and the 
administration has opposed efforts to simplify the 20-factor test.  However, Christensen's efforts 
are expected to receive a hearing by the powerful tax-writing committee in the near future.<p>
<b>Issues No 2:</b> Meal and Entertainment Deduction. Conference delegates called upon 
Congress and the president to enact legislation allowing a 100 percent tax deduction for meals 
and entertainment.  Recent tax laws reduced the deduction to 50 percent.  Although the 100 
percent deduction may be a priority of small  business, it ranks low as an action item in 
Congress.  Politically, the issue would be a ripe target for opponents, who will label it as just 
another perk for the wealthy.<p>
<b>Issue No 3:</b> Regulatory Flexibility Act/Regulatory Reform.  Small business wants federal 
regulatory agencies to determine the costs of their proposed rules and regulations on the small 
business sector.  Amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as recommended by conference 
delegates, would increase the likelihood that cost-impact studies are done by regulators.<p>
The act, combined with a host of other regulatory reforms, passed the House but has 
stalled in the Senate.  Most observers believe all efforts to reform the regulatory system are dead 
for 1996.  Clinton has called the House measures, and similar legislation in the Senate, "too 
extreme."<p>
<b>Issue No 4:</b> Repeal the Federal Estate Tax. Family owned businesses are especially hard 
hit by high estate and gift taxes.  Many businesses fail to make it to the next generation due to the 
burdensome nature of such taxes.  Conference delegates overwhelmingly voted to repeal these 
taxes.  The estate-tax issue has become political fodder for class-warfare rhetoric. Even minor 
efforts to increase the estate-tax exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 have been vastly watered 
down.  The Clinton administration opposes abolishing estate and gift taxes but some estate tax 
relief will probably make it to a final budget deal.<p>
<b>Issue No 5 (tie): </b>Superfund Reform and Health-Care Reform: Many small businesses get 
trapped in what is known as the Superfund web, held liable for expensive government 
environmental cleanup schemes when their actions were legal at the time they disposed of waste.  <p>
Republican Mike Oxley of Ohio has introduced legislation to reform Superfund, but the 
bill does not repeal retroactive liability before 1987  --  a key component sought by reform 
proponents.  Even if a weak bill makes it to the president, he would likely veto the legislation.  <p>
The No. 1 reform on the health-care wish list was the adoption of tax-deductible medical 
savings accounts.  MSAs are included in the budget plan passed by Congress but are opposed by 
the Clinton administration.  Supporters believe that MSAs will probably be part of a final budget 
agreement. <p>
Conference delegates also called for the 100 percent tax deductibility of health care costs.  Small businesses will most likely see an increase to 50 percent phased in over a seven-
year period.<p>
On an optimistic note, at least small businesses won't have to ward off major proposals 
that increase their taxes or regulatory burden.  The only redflag is the President's proposal to 
raise the minimum wage.  A threat perhaps, but the small business lobby has become too 
powerful to allow this to happen.

<title>Rockwell: Who are the True Liberals? -- 9/5/96</title>

<h2>Who are the True Liberals?</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
 The word is: the word "liberal" is out. It won't even
be heard at the Democrat convention. Hardly anyone will admit to
being a liberal anymore, meaning a tax-and-spend, 
guilt-manipulating, counter-cultural statist out of touch with
the regular guy. Even left-wing activists prefer the term 
"progressive."<P>
Of course, the Democrats are as liberal as ever, as we've 
come to understand the term. That is, they identify more with the 
government than with the governed. But this approach is an 
electoral loser.<P>
People believe they are being governed--taxed, regulated,
and otherwise pushed around--to death. Never in the history of
American polling has the federal government been so unpopular.
If "liberalism" is about supporting and expanding this
system, liberals will indeed have to find a new ideological cover. <p>

May they succeed! For the word liberal really belongs to those who favor the free economy and society: the sense in which the word is now used in Eastern Europe. The authentic liberal tradition, dating from the 17th century, is properly identified
with the intellectuals and popular movements who struggled against government power.<p>
Liberalism was born in Spain, when the followers of St. 
Thomas Aquinas discovered how economic freedom works to build
a prosperous society. The writings of the late-scholastics, 
centered around the School of Salamanca, bloomed into a worldwide
movement of "los liberales".<p>
In France, the liberals included A.R.J. Turgot, Jean 
Baptiste Say, and Frric Bastiat. In Britain,
Richard Cobden, John Bright, and Herbert Spencer. In Austria, Carl Menger, Eugen von Bhm-Bawerk, and Ludwig von Mises. In America, Patrick
Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and William Sumner. <p>
Liberals in this classical tradition understand the connection between welfarism and tyranny, big government and empire, central planning and poverty. Their goal is to establish the rule of law, decentralize government, and let capitalism flourish. <p>
How liberalism came to mean the opposite in this country is a twisted tale. Unlike the Old World, where being on the right meant supporting tyrannous regimes and empires, the New World was conceived in liberty. When the centralists and egalitarians began to undo this, beginning in 1861 and continuing to this day, they
purloined the name liberal for themselves. <P>
Yet even as late as the 1920s, some people who called themselves liberals had no beef with capitalism and self-government. They wanted to protect individual rights from
government power. They would never have countenanced a government
that taxed 40 cents on the dollar, promised cradle-to-grave security,
or forbad freedom of association. <p>
But the New Deal changed that. In the name of liberalism, a northeastern elite fastened a vast coercive apparatus on the country, and took us away from liberty and toward the very tyranny the constitution's framers were hoping to prevent.<p>
The term &quot;conservative&quot; didn't come into common use
for another generation. The opponents of the New Deal had no name
for themselves. They liked the name liberal, but with the term stolen
by their opponents, they resorted to cumbersome names like 
"anti-collectivist," "individualist," and
"America firster."<p>
In the post-war period, liberalism has meant consolidating 
and expanding the New Deal framework, while conservatism came
to mean fighting the Cold War, and preferring tradition to ideology. The really serious opponents of collectivism--those who favored capitalism and peace, economic freedom and civil liberties, property rights and states rights--had no name for themselves.<p>
The right term for these political views is "liberal."
But it ' s very difficult for the rightful owners of a word to take
back its meaning while their opponents are using it. After the American Revolution, for example, the centralizers adopted the term "federalists" and called their Jeffersonian opponents "anti-federalists". To this day, the meaning of "federalism"
is ideologically ambiguous. <p>
Rightly defined, liberalism is the view that society should not be centrally controlled, managed, or shaped by government.
Society manages itself, from the bottom up. Consumers, workers, investors, entrepreneurs, parents, and volunteers form 
communities of enterprise and mutual support, while the central
government is not seen, or heard, or felt. <p>
Today the American political landscape is dominated by two 
anti-liberal parties. One loves the welfare state, the other 
loves the warfare state. One wants to stamp out tobacco, the 
other would use the military in the war on drugs.  &lt;p&gt;<BR>
The fullest defense of the liberal society ever penned came 
from Ludwig von Mises in 1927 as  Liberalismus . Only this 
tradition, he said, can save civilization from Nazism, fascism,
communism, socialism, and social democracy. His warning wasn't
heeded, but when the term is reclaimed, Mises's book should be
the platform. <p>

Institute in Auburn, Alabama.</i><p><br>

<h2>Why the District Is Different</h2>

 <P></center><hr>
 <P>
Many taxpayers outside the District of Columbia are saying, "Why is D.C.
getting so much attention and what's all this talk about a flat rate
federal income tax of 15 percent?" After spending nearly two decades as a
District resident and half of that time as a critical observer of
government spending, I admit bias and more than a little pride in my
response, as well as good reasons to move ahead with D.C. Delegate Eleanor
Holmes Norton's plan.
<P>
This is, after all, the nation's capitol. Instead of being the butt of
late-night talk show jokes, every patriotic American should be demanding
that the District be the crown jewel of U.S. cities, and the envy of every
world capitol.
<P>
Just try walking the nearly four-mile round trip from the Capitol to the
Washington Monument. It's safe, it's beautiful, and there's nothing like it
in any other city. Tourists marvel at the sights, and despite rumors that
make the District sound like the Wild West, they still visit in droves.
<P>
Even with its inability to address bloated and inefficient government, D.C.
is not particularly large, nor are its problems insurmountable. Bold and
decisive leadership would do the trick. But progress along these lines
still would not address a fundamental fact: The city's population is
declining rapidly. In the first five years of the 1990s, the population
dropped as much as it did in the entire decade from 1980 to 1990. And many
of those leaving were African-American and middle class.
<P>
The Norton plan is simple -- lure people back into the District by lowering
federal taxes. Support for the bill includes House Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.), Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.). Bipartisan companion legislation has been introduced
in the Senate by Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Senate Joint
Economic Committee Chairman Connie Mack (R-Fla.). Members of the Maryland
and Virginia delegations are also supportive: Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.)
said it could help the entire region become more prosperous, and Rep. Tom
Davis (R-Va.) is moving forward quickly with hearings before his House
Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on the District of Columbia.
<P>
The opposition to the proposal comes from the traditional proponents of
class warfare (the plan benefits the rich more than the poor), and people
in other cities who want the same deal. House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, seeking a more comprehensive tax reform plan, is not
yet in favor of the Norton bill.
<P>
But Washington is different, and it's well worth the projected annual $700
million in lost revenue to the Treasury. We only need to look at a small
portion of the $160 billion in annual federal spending that my organization
-- Citizens Against Government Waste -- identifies as wasteful spending to
find the necessary offsets.
<P>
For example, Congress could eliminate the Market Access Program ($90
million), the Economic Development Administration ($348 million), the
Advanced Technology Program ($300 million), the Appalachian Regional
Commission ($140 million), and the Strategic Petroleum Reserves ($109
million) and the National Biological Survey ($115 million). These
half-dozen programs total $1.1 billion, more than enough to meet the cost
of this new program.
<P>
The issue is not finding the savings, it's convincing skeptics on Capitol
Hill that it's OK to lose control over hundreds of millions of dollars and
that people in D.C. and people who would want to live in the District --
nearly two-thirds of whom are African-American -- really will know how to
spend the money they save from the tax cut.
<P>
The class warfare argument is specious: Individual taxpayers making $15,000
or less; single head of households at $25,000 or less, and joint filers at
$30,000 or less will pay NO federal tax. That means more than half of D.C.
taxpayers will simply be taken off the rolls. Is there any more direct
manner in which to help and reward hardworking lower income people than to
strengthen their ties to their community?
<P>
For those who continue to pay taxes, but at lower rates, the potential for
creating or expanding business is phenomenal. There are 31,000 sole
proprietorships in the District, meaning they pay the individual income tax
rate. Assuming that a tax of $28,000 (28 percent) on business income of
$100,000 would be reduced to $15,000, that $13,000 would no longer be
diffused throughout the national economy, but would be largely directed at
local spending and investment. The resulting savings is enough to hire a
full-time employee, purchase new equipment, or retire outstanding debt that
will lead to additional business opportunities.
<P>
The kicker in the tax reduction scheme is the elimination of capital gains
taxes for investments in D.C. by District residents. So what would a
<P>
logical person do with their savings? Invest it in local businesses.
<P>
That's what I plan to do -- in fact, I pledge that one-third of the savings
I will obtain from lower taxes will be invested in D.C. businesses, either
directly, or through market opportunities. If every D.C. taxpayer followed
this lead, there would be approximately $233 million (assuming one-third of
the $700 million in revenue lost to the federal government) available for
investment in D.C. Or, if only the richest taxpayers (1994 figures) -- the
4,396 whose income exceeds $200,000 and who paid $600 million, or 35.2
percent of D.C.'s $1.7 billion in taxes -- did the same, there would still
be more than $82 million for city business. Or take the 15,313 returns for
people making more than $100,000 annually. They paid $900 million, or 52.9
percent of 1994 taxes, meaning if they pledged one-third of their savings,
there would be more than $123 million to increase the city's employment and
business base.
<P>
Best of all, that money would not flow through the inefficient hands of the
federal bureaucracy, and it would remain where people know best how to use
it. With what's left over, charitable Washingtonians could support local
nonprofits, the arts, schools, and religion, all of which will be more
direct help to the needy than the federal or local government could ever
provide. And let's not forget what it would mean for this city to have
people wanting to move in, rather than out, of the District. Beyond the
obvious greater tax base, we would enhance the support of institutions that
are key to long-term urban health -- our neighborhoods and our schools.
<P>
All of this may be too logical for the bean counters and those ready to
write off the city's future. But most Americans have a vision of our
nation's Capitol that is rooted in the past and looking to tomorrow. The
Norton plan is the best way to get us all on this hopeful path.
<P>

<h2>            
Feminist Assault On Reasonableness
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                    


     Now that women are attending law schools in greater numbers,
     feminists are turning up as law school professors, law review
     writers, state legislators, congressional staffers, prosecutors,
     law clerks, and even judges. The result is ominous for basic
     concepts of American law and justice, and an excellent policy
     analysis on "feminist jurisprudence" by the Cato Institute
     explains why.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminist goal is not fair treatment for women, but the
     redistribution of power from the "dominant class" (the male
     patriarchal system) to the "subordinate" class (nominally women,
     but actually only the feminists who know how to play by rules
     they have invented). They even want to establish a license for
     women to kill their allegedly abusive spouses.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     They have peddled the fiction that men are engaged in a vast
     conspiracy against women, that something like 85 percent of
     employed women are sexually harassed in the workplace, and that
     something on the order of 50 to 70 percent of wives are beaten by
     their husbands. They want to establish the rule that offenses
     against women should be defined (not objectively, but
     subjectively) on the basis of how the woman felt instead of what
     the defendant did.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Before the feminist movement burst on the scene in the 1970s,
     there were literally hundreds of laws that gave advantages or
     protections to women based on society's common sense recognition
     of the facts of life and human nature. These included the
     prohibition against statutory rape, the Mann Act, the obligation
     of the husband to support his wife and provide her with a home,
     special protections for widows (e.g., one state gave widows a
     little property tax exemption, another prescribed triple
     penalties against anyone who cheated a widow), and laws that made
     it a misdemeanor to use obscene or profane language in the
     presence of a woman.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The premier feminist lawyer in the 1970s, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
     argued that all such differences of treatment based on gender
     were sex discriminatory and, therefore, should be abolished. She
     won several Supreme Court cases on that theory, and, in state
     after state as well as in Congress, feminist lawyers persuaded
     legislators to gender-neutralize their laws.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In theory, Ginsburg appeared to demand a doctrinaire equality,
     opposing the Mann Act because it "was meant to protect weak women
     from bad men" and that was demeaning to women. But in practice,
     she demanded affirmative action for women even in the military.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Now the feminists don't even pay lip service to a gender equality
     goal. They have launched a broadside attack on such basic
     precepts as equality under the law, judicial neutrality, a
     defendant is innocent until proven guilty, conviction requires
     proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and guilt or liability should be
     judged according to the traditional "reasonable man" theory.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Female plaintiffs had always been able to sue for unwanted sexual
     overtures in the workplace by using the common-law remedies of
     tort and contract. Feminists reject this remedy because they want
     sexual harassment cases to be based on the notion of a male
     conspiracy to victimize women and that a "hostile work
     environment" is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title
     VII of the Civil Rights Act.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Supreme Court adopted this feminist theory in the 1986 case
     of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, where the Court even went so
     far as to say that "'voluntariness' in the sense of consent" is
     not a defense. These notions had been invented by Michigan Law
     School professor Catharine MacKinnon, who was reported to have
     boasted, "What the decision means is that we made this law up
     from the beginning, and now we've won."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A 1991 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision replaced the
     common-law "reasonable man" standard with a "reasonable woman"
     test, embracing the feminist notion that men and women can't see
     the same events in the same way. The court declared that the old
     common-law standard "systematically ignores the experiences of
     women."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Now the feminists are demanding the "unreasonable woman" rule.
     The feminists want the victim rather than the law to define the
     offense.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In a 1991 Jacksonville, Florida case, a federal district court
     found an employer guilty of a "hostile work environment" even
     though there was no evidence of sexual language or demands
     directed at the plaintiff who claimed she felt sexually harassed.
     The other female workers said they did not feel sexually
     harassed, but the judge said that merely provided "additional
     evidence of victimization."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminists are actively promoting college speech codes to
     prohibit what they call discriminatory or harassing speech. They
     argue that it's just as actionable for a man to call a woman
     "honey" or "baby" as to call her a "bitch"; and, of course, jokes
     are not allowed. Nearly 400 colleges and universities have these
     anti-First Amendment speech regulations, about a third of which
     target mere "advocacy of offensive or outrageous viewpoints or
     biased ideas."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminists want the battered woman syndrome to free any woman
     from conviction of violent crime. The feminists are even pushing
     the Catharine MacKinnon notion that all heterosexual sex is rape
     unless an affirmative, sober, explicit verbal consent can be
     proven.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     They want the action of a battered woman who kills her husband to
     be considered as normal, and that killing a man in his sleep can
     be called self-defense.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     More lawyers, scholars and academics are badly needed to speak up
     and expose the feminist foolishness for what it is: a scurrilous
     attack on our Bill of Rights.

<H2>GUATEMALA Y SU BUROCRACIA</H2>
<p>
Manuel F. Ayau*
<p>
CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Cada día estamos más a la cola en las listas de
países según su riqueza y (¿será coincidencia?) también entre las naciones
que gozan de menos libertad.  Aquí el ciudadano no es libre de hacer nada
por derecho, pues todo requiere una ley que permite que algún brillante
funcionario del gobierno le dé licencia o autorización.  El dictador no
tiene nombre y apellido; es el funcionario que sabe mejor que Ud. cómo
manejar su negocio.
<p>
Lo primero que debemos reconocer es que la pobreza es culpa
nuestra y sólo la podemos curar desde adentro. Las dádivas del exterior que
tanto nos gustan solamente son unas gotas que más bien sirven de soporífero
humillante y que contribuyen a agrandar la brecha entre los países ricos y
nosotros porque nos da una falsa esperanza que pospone tomar las medidas
correctas. Y esa ayuda casi siempre viene acompañada de consejos
equivocados, pues los dispensadores de dádivas, debido a la misma filosofía
que los califica para su trabajo, tienen una visión poco realista del mundo
real.
<p> 
La preocupación por la brecha entre ricos y pobres es uno de
los factores que no permiten eliminar la miseria porque cuando la riqueza
del país aumenta, los pobres son menos pobres, pero los ricos son más ricos.
Tenemos entonces que escoger qué es lo que queremos lograr: ¿eliminar la
pobreza o eliminar las diferencias entre pobres y ricos?
<p>
Volando sobre la capital y observando cómo se ha rodeado de
cinturones de pobreza, me pregunto, cuánta gente viene del interior porque
no hay teléfonos y por ello no se establecen empresas ni se crean empleos.
Esos cinturones son parte del precio de haber prohibido que cualquiera
pudiera competir en el negocio telefónico en nuestra paternalista Guatemala.  
<p>
Nos tomó muchos años aprender que una tasa de cambio
artificial causaba crisis y, en consecuencia, retrocedimos una década.
Después nos ha costado mucho aprender que haber elevado las tasas de interés
a niveles estratosféricos produce recesión. Cada vez que probamos una
"brillante" política incurrimos en el carísimo proceso de aprendizaje.
<p>
La próxima brillante idea es la de privatizar "con creatividad". En vez de simplemente
privatizar, es decir, proceder a vender por subasta pública internacional las empresas
estatales y dejarlas que operen libremente bajo las leyes generales del país, ya se
están inventando ingeniosos modelos, avalados por "brillantes" asesores extranjeros
("empresarios" en recomendar políticas) para que el gobierno dirija la
industria eléctrica, dé concesiones, otorgue licencias, fije precios, etc.
Todo para que las empresas privadas "no hagan cosas inconvenientes".
Además, se bautizó a los nuevos ministerios con otros nombres, como
Superintendencia de Comunicaciones o la Comisión Nacional de Electricidad.
Estos pequeños nuevos ministerios, al cabo de los años, tendrán su propio
edificio, donde se puedan hacer trámites engorrosos. Así mismo nacieron el
Inde, Guatel, Minería, Hidrocarburos y tantas otras superintendencias y
comisiones que nos han empobrecido, impidiendo el progreso nacional.  
<p>
La Corte de Constitucionalidad anuló la Constitución y nos
informó que Guatel no es un monopolio telefónico aunque está prohibido
competir con él. También nos dijo que los precios de la energía se pueden
interferir por razones ideológicas, aunque no cubran costos. Y el nuevo
proyecto de ley eléctrica mantiene que los precios de la energía son libres,
siempre que no se usen las calles para distribuirla. ¡Brillante!
Evidentemente seguiremos pobres porque en Guatemala seguimos confundiendo un
régimen de legalidad con uno de derecho. ©

<H2>CHILE EN LAS GRANDES LIGAS</H2>
<p>
Carlos A. Ball*
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Cuando en América Latina hablábamos de empresas
multinacionales nos referíamos a compañías como la Standard Oil, United
Fruit, US Steel o Anaconda. Esas han cambiado sus nombres, han perdido
importancia o fueron nacionalizadas durante nuestra mala racha de socialismo
nacionalista. Pero lo interesante es que hoy varias de las más vigorosas
multinacionales, en plena expansión en países como Argentina, Perú y Brasil,
son empresas de capital chileno que hasta hace menos de una década eran
comatosas empresas estatales, con exceso de personal y que además de dar
pésimo servicio producían inmensas pérdidas.
<p>
 Una de estas nuevas multinacionales, Enersis S.A., a fines de noviembre
colocó exitosamente, a través de J. P. Morgan, Merril Lynch y Salomon
Brothers, $800 millones en bonos con vencimiento en los años 2006, 2016 y
2026. Parte de esos fondos irán a Brasil, donde Enersis -en asociación con
empresas eléctricas de España y Portugal- acaba de ganar la licitación para
adquirir por $588 millones el 70% de la Compañía Eléctrica de Río de
Janeiro, una empresa estatal que durante los primeros nueve meses de este
año logró perder $122 millones.
<p>
 Según el Wall Street Journal, Enersis hoy en día controla empresas con
valor de mercado por unos $13.000 millones, habiéndose logrado convertir en
una de las favoritas de los inversionistas institucionales especializados en
mercados emergentes.
<p>
 José Yuraszeck, el presidente de 45 años de Enersis S.A., era a principios
de los años 70 uno de los valientes jóvenes estudiantes que manifestaban su
oposición al régimen socialista de Salvador Allende. Luego del golpe
militar, el gobierno de Pinochet le asignó la misión de desmantelar el
control estatal en la empresa eléctrica de Santiago, Chilectra Metropolitana.
<p>
 Chilectra fue privatizada en 1987 y Yuraszeck logró convertirse en su
administrador con el apoyo de fondos de pensión privados y de los empleados
que adquirieron acciones de la empresa. Poco después repetiría la misma
estrategia para comprar la Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (Endesa), la más
grande  generadora de energía eléctrica en Chile. Bajo la visionaria
gerencia de José Yuraszeck, la capitalización de Enersis, la empresa matriz
dueña tanto de Chilectra como Endesa, se ha multiplicado 57 veces desde
1988, hasta alcanzar unos $4.000 millones en la actualidad. 
<p>
 Su primera inversión extranjera la realizó el grupo en 1992, en la
Argentina, al adquirir el control de Edesur S.A., una de las empresas
distribuidoras de electricidad en Buenos Aires, a la vez que dos grandes
empresas generadoras: Central Costanera S.A. y El Chocón. En 1994, el grupo
Enersis haría lo mismo en Lima, al adquirir una importante participación en
la empresa más grande de energía eléctrica del Perú. El éxito de Enersis en
el extranjero se basa en reducir drásticamente el robo de electricidad y
cambiar el tradicional letargo burocrático de las empresas estatales de
energía por una vibrante cultura empresarial.
<p>
 Además de una inversión inicial de $490 millones para la adquisición de
Edesur, Enersis invirtió otros $340 millones en modernizar las
instalaciones, convirtiendo a 360.000 personas que se aprovechaban de
energía gratuita en clientes de la empresa. Edesur pasó de perder $62
millones en 1993 a producir utilidades por $59,5 millones el año pasado.
<p>
 Enersis piensa repetir la misma historia con la Compañía de Electricidad de
Río de Janeiro, la cual da servicio a 1,2 millones de clientes. El potencial
de crecimiento en el Brasil es inmenso.
<p>
 De todo esto, la primera lección es que la producción y distribución de
energía eléctrica nada tiene que ver con "soberanía" ni con industrias
"básicas y estratégicas reservadas al estado" sino, más bien, con eficiencia
y productividad. La segunda es que hay amplio financiamiento privado en
respaldo de empresas exitosas y empresarios visionarios. Y la tercera es que
hombres como Yuraszeck los hay también en países como Cuba y Venezuela, sólo
que la falta de libertad bajo el socialismo los aplasta. ©

<H2>INFLACION: LA ESPECIALIDAD DE LA CASA</H2>
<p>
Alvaro Bardón*
<p>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El nuevo presidente del Banco Central de Chile,
Carlos Massad, entregó recientemente unas cifras sobre la inflación que
conviene consignar. Sostuvo que desde mediados de los años 30 hasta la fecha
el nivel de precios se multiplicó por un factor de 85 millones, de manera
tal que si alguien hubiera guardado o ahorrado en 1936 mil millones de
pesos, tendría hoy solamente once pesos. Naturalmente, la gente no es
estúpida y para evitar en parte el robo inflacionario disminuyó su demanda
de pesos y se fue a dólares, al ahorro en bienes durables y materias primas
y desde hace unos 30 años al ahorro en títulos reajustables, cuando el
gobierno lo permitió y lo legisló.
<p>
 En el intervalo Chile vivió en huelgas porque los trabajadores, con razón,
pedían reajustes de sus remuneraciones nominales.  Los jubilados, que no
podían hacer protestas efectivas, veían que sus pensiones se desvanecían y
todos los chilenos descubrieron, primero a fines de los 50 y luego a
mediados de los 70, que sus fondos previsionales habían desaparecido y que
las solidarias cajas estatales estaban en quiebra. No sólo por la
inflación-robo sino por mala administración. En Chile, como se sabe,
cambiamos al sistema privado de pensiones y los fondos están mejor
invertidos en títulos reajustables, acciones y una amplia gama de valores en
moneda nacional y extranjera. Demás está decir que la inflación derribó
varios gobiernos, mediante elecciones, y, por la fuerza a Salvador Allende,
en 1973, cuando el aumento de precios llegó a 1000% y la hiperinflación nos
aplastaba.
<p>
 En 1996 la inflación fue de 6,5% y en 1997 será según Massad, de 5,5%.
Asegura, además, que hacia fines del siglo Chile tendrá una inflación como
la de los países industrializados. Sin embargo, no será fácil porque la
voracidad del gobierno chileno se está pareciendo a la del pasado. Su gasto
ha crecido al 7% real desde 1990 y en 1996 y 1997 se acerca peligrosamente a
los dos dígitos. El fisco mantiene superávit y ahorra porque los ingresos
tributarios han subido por el rápido crecimiento de la economía y por alzas
en impuestos como el IVA, a la renta y otros específicos. Pero el mayor
gasto estatal presiona la demanda interna y con ello la inflación. 
El Banco Central  se hace cómplice de este mayor gasto manteniendo altas las
tasas de interés y limitando los créditos externos de corto plazo con otro
impuesto que denomina encaje. Así se reprime el gasto privado en consumo e
inversión y se le hace espacio al estado para que siga despilfarrando el
dinero de todos en ineficiencia productiva, reajustes a empleados públicos
que trabajan poco, fomentos inútiles y un gasto social enorme que no ha
mejorado los servicios educacionales ni de salud y, se estima, que en más de
un 60% va a parar a los bolsillos de los que no se clasifican como pobres.
Estos pagan impuestos, como todos, y reciben a cambio algo de lo que queda
después de las filtraciones a otros sectores y del pago de una frondosa
burocracia.
<p>
 Como es natural, esta política terminará por perjudicar la tasa de
crecimiento de la economía chilena y del empleo que ayuda a los pobres
directamente. Esto ya se observa pero se le da poca importancia. Incluso el
premio Nobel Robert Lucas, de visita en el país, sostuvo que con el vuelo
que agarró la economía chilena con los pasados cambios estructurales podía
seguir creciendo bien un buen rato. Yo, por el contrario, pienso que si no
se corrige la tendencia al alza del gasto público, la economía perderá
dinamismo y le costará mucho alcanzar las tasas de inflación de los países
más avanzados. ©

<H2>GANGSTERISMO POLITICO EN VENEZUELA</H2>
<p>
Héctor Betancourt*
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En la Venezuela actual, políticos poderosos utilizan a
policías y a jueces para despojar a ciudadanos de sus propiedades. Y no me
refiero a hechos aislados en remotas poblaciones del interior sino a lo que
me está sucediendo a mi, en mi hacienda El Encantado, la mayor extensión de
terreno privado, todavía sin desarrollar, en el valle de Caracas.
<p>
 Durante doce años, el diputado suplente al Congreso Nacional Alejandro
Kaufman ha utilizado el contrato que tiene de administración del Cementerio
del Este para irse apoderando de los terrenos municipales que rodean al
cementerio, procediendo luego a desplazar linderos, tumbar cercas de los
vecinos y a enterrar muertos en terrenos ajenos. Cuando los propietarios se
vienen a dar cuenta, ya tienen varios cientos de muertos enterrados en sus
tierras, con todas las complicaciones humanas y legales que ello implica.
<p>
 En 1994, el diputado Kaufman se adueñó fraudulentamente de 100 mil metros
cuadrados de terrenos municipales en complicidad con la Oficina de Registro
del 5° Circuito. Esto fue denunciado al ayuntamiento y al gobierno central,
sin que las autoridades reaccionaran. A mi y a otros propietarios nos
preocupaba porque sabíamos que una vez que se adueñara de los terrenos
municipales colindantes, Kaufman procedería a invadir y a tratar de
despojarnos de nuestras propiedades, como en efecto ahora está sucediendo.
Kaufman es un personaje que se jacta públicamente de no tener abogados a su
servicio sino a jueces. Armado de un oficio emitido por la Ingeniería
Municipal que ilegalmente determina que los caminos privados de mi hacienda
son de uso público, introduce tractores a mi propiedad para derribar cercas
y portones, respaldado con policías municipales y agentes de la Disip, la
policía política, de cuyo director es compadre. Durante la noche y por
varias horas, disparan contra mi casa, donde vivo con mi madre, esposa y
pequeños hijos, para tratar de amedrentarnos y que accedamos a dejarnos
robar. También mantiene intervenidas mis líneas telefónicas y vigila todos
mis movimientos.
<p>
 Parte del problema se debe a la corrupción rampante en los registros de
propiedad venezolanos. Con unos títulos de propiedad falsos que incluyen 80
hectáreas de mi hacienda, una empresa pirata consiguió en 1986 un crédito
por $5 millones en el Banco Industrial, propiedad del estado. Esta hipoteca
fue luego traspasada al Banco Provincial, el banco más grande del país. A
pesar que le informamos a la Oficina de Registro y al propio banco que se
trataba de títulos falsos, en base a la misma hipoteca le aumentaron el
crédito a más de $20 millones. Cuando la empresa involucrada no pudo pagar
la deuda, el Banco Provincial ejecutó la hipoteca y vendió los terrenos el
16 de agosto de este año a Kaufman por sólo $425.000, absorbiendo una
cuantiosa pérdida, pero dejando constancia en el documento de venta que no
se responsabiliza del saneamiento de la propiedad. ¿Cómo logra el Banco
Provincial registrar el traspaso de la propiedad cuando los documentos que
tiene son falsos? Pienso que la única explicación es que la esposa del
presidente del Banco Provincial es la directora nacional de los registros de
propiedad.
<p>
Cuando denuncié estos hechos a la prensa venezolana, la respuesta del
diputado Kaufman fue ingresar a mi hacienda, la noche del 23 de septiembre,
acompañado de 20 hombres, entre ellos policías municipales y agentes de la
Disip uniformados, portando armas de guerra. Kaufman me agredió físicamente,
rompiéndome a golpes cuatro costillas, mientras sus secuaces me sujetaban,
todo esto en presencia de mi abogado y del gerente de mi hacienda.
Esa noche ingresé a la emergencia de la Clínica Metropolitana de Caracas y
con el informe médico y las radiografías hice la denuncia ante la Policía
Técnica Judicial al día siguiente, siendo examinado por funcionarios de la
medicatura forense. Seguidamente, el diputado Kaufman logra que mi denuncia
sea pasada a la jurisdicción de la juez Mari Carmen La Riva Ron, quien me
llamó a declarar y también a los médicos forenses que habían elaborado el
informe. Ellos dijeron -bajo alguna presión- que sus firmas habían sido
falsificadas. La juez, entonces, procedió a emitir el 16 de diciembre una
orden de arresto en mi contra por calumnia agravada y por forjamiento de
documentos.
<p>
 Quien haya leído el reportaje sobre las cárceles de Caracas aparecido en la
primera página del Miami Herald el domingo 22 de diciembre, bajo el título
de "Infierno en la Tierra", sabe que nadie en su sano juicio se entrega en
Venezuela y mucho menos durante vacaciones judiciales, cuando los ciudadanos
quedamos totalmente desamparados. Por ello me vi obligado a fugarme en una
avioneta a una isla del Caribe y de allí me vine a Florida. Una vez
concluidas las festividades de año nuevo, tengo todas las intenciones de
seguir en mi lucha por conservar intacta la propiedad que heredé de mi padre.
<p>
 Comprendo que el sector político venezolano me considera una anomalía. En
mi país, quienes no tenemos padrinos políticos no estamos supuestos a
enfrentarnos a los poderosos sino a negociar con ellos, de manera que lo que
nos quitan sea compensado con alguno de los privilegios que políticos y
funcionarios graciosamente están en capacidad de asignar. Yo no estoy
dispuesto a convertirme en cómplice del gangsterismo político venezolano y
tengo la intención de dejarle a mis hijos la misma herencia limpia que
recibí de mi padre. ©

<H2>PROPIEDAD PRIVADA Y DESARROLLO SOSTENIBLE</H2>
<p>
Julian Morris*
<p>
SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Después de la II Guerra Mundial,
políticos y  economistas se obsesionaron con el tema del desarrollo
económico. Las naciones fueron clasificadas según su producto per capita;
aquellas con un producto per capita mayor se designaron "desarrolladas" y
las demás "subdesarrolladas". Instituciones multilaterales como el Banco
Mundial y el FMI que se habían creado para revivir a Europa devastada por la
guerra, pronto se dedicaron a una nueva misión: fomentar el desarrollo
económico en los países atrasados. Miles de millones de dólares se gastaron
en proyectos que supuestamente lograrían alcanzar la meta del desarrollo.
<p>
 Lamentablemente, los planes simplistas de políticos y burócratas
infrecuentemente alcanzan sus magnánimos propósitos. Así sucedió, en parte
porque el dinero lo prestaron a gobiernos que sufren de corrupción endémica
(se estima que la riqueza personal del presidente Mobutu es igual a la deuda
nacional de Zaire) y también porque los proyectos fueron mal concebidos. Por
ejemplo, inmensas obras hidroeléctricas benefician a empresas de aluminio
pero poco hacen por eliminar la pobreza entre campesinos que viven en
tierras áridas.
<p>
 En los años 80 comenzó a surgir la preocupación de que estos proyectos
grandiosos tenían un impacto negativo en el medio ambiente, especialmente
las represas que inundan la selva y obras de riego que salinizan las
tierras. Entonces, el primer ministro noruego, Gro Harlem Brundtland,
inventó el término "desarrollo sostenible", reconociendo que el desarrollo
industrial no es en sí mismo algo positivo, sino que debe lograrse dentro de
un marco legal que proteja el derecho de individuos a no ser perjudicados,
tanto ahora como en el futuro.
<p>
 En la compleja sociedad moderna, la mejor manera de asegurarse que el
desarrollo se lleve a cabo de manera sostenible es descentralizando lo más
posible el poder de decisión. Esto conlleva a responsabilizar a individuos
por conservar los recursos naturales. Cuando una persona es dueña de un
recurso tiene  la motivación para conservarlo porque sabe que se beneficiará
de él mañana, el año que viene, dentro de una década y sus herederos dentro
de un siglo. Cuando los políticos controlan los recursos tienen un menor
incentivo de conservarlo porque su principal interés es ser reelecto.
<p>
 Un reciente estudio de Alex James de Cambridge University encontró que las
inversiones en reservas de animales depende de quien las administra. La
menor inversión se hace en las reservas que son administradas y que
pertenecen al estado; algo más en las reservas que son del estado pero
administradas independientemente y la inversión es mucho mayor en aquellas
que pertenecen y son administradas por el sector privado.
<p>
 Otra condición necesaria para el desarrollo sostenible es que los
individuos puedan intercambiar (vender) los derechos de propiedad. Es
deseable que cada recurso se utilice de la manera más eficiente y ello sólo
ocurre cuando cada recurso es utilizado por el individuo que lo valora más,
para lo cual es necesario que se pueda traspasar libremente la propiedad.
<p>
 Tanto las naciones industrializadas como las naciones en desarrollo
comienzan a darse cuenta que las regulaciones ambientales son a menudo
exageradamente costosas. Además, muchas regulaciones tienen consecuencias
dañinas al medio ambiente. Un ejemplo clásico ocurrió en Bolivia, donde se
prohibió la tala de ciertos árboles. Tan pronto la gente se enteró de que
iba a salir el decreto, se cortaron muchísimos de esos árboles.
<p>
 Es más efectivo el cuido del ambiente cuando se les permite a individuos
hacerlo. En Inglaterra, los pescadores han protegido a los ríos de la
contaminación demandando a industrias que los ensuciaban. Lamentablemente,
las regulaciones que estipulan un máximo de emisiones contaminantes de hecho
le dan a las industrias el derecho de contaminar hasta ese límite. Si vamos
a avanzar hacia el desarrollo sostenible debemos revisar las bases en que se
fundamenta la regulación ambiental. ©

<H2>LAS CUENTAS DEL GRAN CAPITAN</H2>
<p>
Agustín Navarro*
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Las "Cuentas del Gran Capitán" son definidas por
el Diccionario de la Lengua Española como aquellas cuentas "exorbitantes y
formadas arbitrariamente y sin  justificación". Algunos autores refieren que
el Gran Capitán Gonzalo de Córdoba presentó partidas de descargo ante el Rey
de Nápoles, que venían a ser así:  "200.736 ducados y 9 reales para frailes,
monjas y pobres que rueguen a Dios por la prosperidad de las armas
españolas; 100 millones en picos, palas y azadones; 100.000 ducados en
pólvora y balas; 10.000 ducados en guantes perfumados para preservar del mal
olor de los cadáveres de los enemigos tendidos en el campo de batalla;
170.000 ducados en poner y renovar campanas destruidas con el uso continuo
de repicar por nuevas victorias conseguidas sobre el enemigo; 50.000 ducados
en aguardiente para las tropas en un día de combate; millón y medio de ídem
para mantener prisioneros y heridos; un millón en misas de gracias y Te Deum
al Todopoderoso; tres millones de sufragios por los muertos; 700.492 ducados
en espías y cien millones por mi paciencia en escuchar que el Rey pedía
cuentas al que le ha regalado un reino".
<p>
 Cualquier semejanza de las cuentas anteriores con la campaña
presidencial mexicana en 1994 y en especial con los gastos electorales en la
última elección de gobernador en el Estado de Tabasco es pura coincidencia.
Como se ve, este asunto de las cuentas alegres es un recurso muy viejo y
desgastado. 
<p>
La única innovación que se advierte en la vetusta tecnología del maquillaje
de las cifras oficiales es que en México las Cuentas del Gran Capitán se
fabrican con anticipación a las batallas electorales, como ocurre ahora ante
las cruciales elecciones de 1997, en que estarán en juego la renovación
total de la Cámara de Diputados, parcial de la Cámara de Senadores, seis
gobernaciones estatales y la sede del Gran Capitán, la gran Ciudad de México.
<p>
 Veamos un caso ejemplar de la tecnología local en el manejo
de cifras: la milagrosa recuperación de las reservas internacionales del
país, proeza casi comparable con nuestra eficacia para perderlas en un
santiamén, en 1994. 
<p>
 Las Cuentas del Gran Capitán Don Miguel Mancera, presidente
del Banco de México, son más o menos las siguientes: Reservas
Internacionales al cierre: $17.509 millones, $1.768 millones más que en
1995. ¡Magnífico! Sin embargo, los $5.829 millones de activos netos no toman
en cuenta los pasivos con el Fondo Monetario Internacional por más de
$13.260 millones. Así, las presuntas reservas desaparecen y la falsedad de
las Cuentas del Gran Capitán queda en plena evidencia. Respaldar al Peso con
deuda externa (FMI) no es sano ni correcto ni ha sido una defensa efectiva
contra los ataques especulativos. Siempre terminamos más endeudados.
<p>
 El artificio de convertir préstamos en reservas, como un
engaño preelectoral no tendría mayor efecto si por el otro lado no
estuvieran aumentando la circulación de dinero sin respaldo. En septiembre,
la Base Monetaria andaba en 47.806 millones de pesos y a finales de
diciembre estaba en 87.434 millones, un espectacular 83% de aumento. Por lo
menos necesitamos $11.000 millones propios, no prestados,  para darle un
respaldo  firme a los Pesos que andan circulando hoy en día. 
<p>
 Las Cuentas del Gran Capitán en las que el gobierno está
apostando para conservar la mayoría de Congreso deben exhibirse, porque
constituye un engaño premeditado con fines políticoelectorales. Ni la
fantasiosa macroeconomía está tan bien (¡ahí vienen todos los déficits!) ni
mucho  menos ha mejorado la microeconomía real de los bolsillos y la boca de
los mexicanos. Arriesgar nuevamente al país a una crisis recurrente mediante
gasto público, inflación monetaria, más impuestos y subsidios no sólo pone
en evidencia esa incapacidad técnica para gobernar que debe pronto terminar,
sino la inmoralidad de hacer política bajo la premisa de que el fin
justifica los medios. ©

<H2>GLOBALIZACION DE LA ECONOMIA</H2>
<p>
Luis Pazos*
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace poco una periodista me presentó en Panamá
como  partidario de la globalización. Es frecuente que cuando explicamos un
fenómeno económico, que se da independientemente de que estemos de acuerdo
con él o no, inmediatamente nos adjudican etiquetas. Lo importante para
muchos intelectuales no es explicar el fenómeno sino ubicarlo dentro de
ciertas tendencias y con base en ello aplaudirlo o criticarlo. Esa actitud
es tan absurda como acusar de partidario de las tormentas a aquel que
explica porqué llueve.
<p>
 La globalización no es una moda ni corresponde a un esquema neoliberal; es
producto del avance tecnológico, fruto de las innovaciones y descubrimientos
del siglo XX.
<p>
 Bajo el término globalización entendemos el intercambio generalizado de
bienes y servicios entre países y continentes. Hace siglos, cuando el
principal transporte era el burro o el caballo, el comercio no podía llegar
más allá de unos cuantos kilómetros a la redonda; ahora que un avión recorre
en menos de un día los puntos más distantes del planeta también las
mercancías lo pueden hacer. El fax, la comunicación vía satélite, el correo
electrónico y la transferencia de fondos en unos segundos de un punto de la
tierra a otro son instrumentos que han propiciado la globalización de la
economía.
<p>
 Ante las tormentas y la lluvia no es relevante ser de derecha o de
izquierda, sino salir con gabardina y paraguas. Ante la globalización, no se
trata de estar a favor o en contra, sino de prepararse para operar
eficientemente bajo esa nueva circunstancia. Si ignoramos la lluvia, nos
mojamos. Y si como profesionales, empresarios o nación pasamos por la alto
la globalización, nos quedaremos atrasados, empobrecidos y seremos desplazados.
<p>
 Desde el punto de vista profesional, la globalización implica un esfuerzo
adicional  para capacitarse y conocer los adelantos tecnológicos referentes
a nuestra especialidad, no tan sólo en nuestra ciudad sino de todas partes.
Como empresario es necesario identificar las técnicas que usan no sólo
nuestros competidores de la misma región, sino de todo el mundo, con quienes
tarde o temprano estaremos compitiendo también. Como gobernante y político
significa tener en cuenta que las leyes fiscales, laborales, ecológicas,
comerciales, industriales, etc. serán comparadas y evaluadas con respecto a
las de otros países, y seleccionando entre las naciones que brinden mejores
condiciones los inversionistas decidirán dónde invertirán, crear empresas,
empleos y, por lo tanto, mejores niveles de vida.
<p>
 La globalización es la internacionalización de las actividades económicas
debido a la reducción de las distancias, de los tiempos y la simultaneidad
de la información a nivel mundial. No es una moda, sino un fenómeno producto
de la tecnología en las postrimerías del siglo XX. ©

<H2>EL TAMAÑO DEL BUEN GOBIERNO</H2>
<p>
Richard Rahn*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El presidente Clinton declaró que había terminado la era
del gobierno grande. Como los republicanos llevan años argumentando que el
gobierno es demasiado grande, parece que ambos partidos ahora se pondrán de
acuerdo en reducirlo. La pregunta es cuánto.
<p>
 La respuesta corta es que el gobierno debe ser entre 60% y 80% de su tamaño
actual para maximizar el crecimiento económico y el bienestar social. Las
propuestas presupuestarias de ambos partidos reconocen que el gobierno ha
crecido por encima de su tamaño óptimo, pero ninguno de los dos partidos ha
hecho propuestas sobre cómo reducirlo hasta alcanzar ese tamaño óptimo.
<p>
 Con el propósito de determinar más exactamente el tamaño óptimo de los
gobiernos, recientemente completé un estudio con los profesores Harrison y
Linn Fox, patrocinado por la Fundación Krieble, que analiza la relación
entre crecimiento económico y el tamaño del gobierno central en 57 países,
desde 1951 hasta 1993. Incluimos todas las naciones que cuentan con
estadísticas razonablemente confiables y cuyo Producto Interno Bruto era de
más de $5.000 millones, sin incluir aquellos cuya economía depende de
exportaciones petroleras. Utilizamos sólo datos de los gobiernos centrales
porque los regionales y locales no son muy confiables en muchos países.
<p>
 Debido a que los gobiernos locales gastan entre 5% y 15% del PIB, nuestros
resultados subestiman el tamaño verdadero de los gobiernos. Por ejemplo, el
gobierno federal de Estados Unidos gastó en 1996 21% del PIB, mientras que
los gobiernos locales gastaron 12%, para un total de 33%
<p>
 Encontramos que se maximiza el crecimiento económico cuando los gastos del
gobierno central alcanzan entre 10% y 15%. Por encima de eso, la tasa de
crecimiento consistentemente se reduce a medida que crece el tamaño relativo
del gobierno. Otras investigaciones recientes, utilizando cifras de Estados
Unidos, indican también que en este país el tamaño del gobierno está muy por
encima del óptimo que maximizaría el bienestar general.
<p>
 Por ejemplo, un estudio de 1995 de la Universidad de Ohio concluye que "el
tamaño óptimo del gobierno federal es alrededor de 17,6% del PIB".  La
investigación del National Center for Policy Analysis concluye que para
"maximizar el crecimiento económico, la combinación de tasas de impuestos
federales, estadales y locales debe totalizar entre 21,5% y 22,9% del PIB.
Este estudio del profesor Gerald Scully implica un sector gubernamental
central de aproximadamente 15% del PIB y que el actual tamaño de los
gobiernos locales son exagerados también.
<p>
 No es ningún misterio que los gobiernos han crecido demasiado. Los grupos
de presión siempre tendrán mayor motivación en la exigencia de nuevos y más
extensos programas gubernamentales que aquellos otros grupos que piden
moderación. Los impuestos y la habilidad de endeudarse de los gobiernos
imponen costos significantes a la economía y reducen los incentivos para
trabajar, ahorrar e invertir. Los gastos gubernamentales raramente tienen
los mismos controles que caracterizan al sector privado y pocas veces están
sujetos a rigurosos análisis de costo/beneficio.
<p>
 El gobierno grande es un fenómeno relativamente nuevo, en gran parte
causado por la influencia de socialistas y keynesianos, quienes al contrario
de los próceres de nuestra independencia ven al gobierno como una panacea en
vez de como una amenaza. Históricamente, la participación del gobierno en el
PIB era modesta en casi todos los países. Un reciente estudio del FMI
muestra que en las naciones industriales más avanzadas el gasto
gubernamental como proporción del PIB aumentó de un promedio de 8,3% en 1870
a 47,2% en 1994. Para 1929, el gasto total del gobierno en Estados Unidos
era 10% del PIB y del gobierno federal un minúsculo 2,6% del PIB.
<p>
 El énfasis de la acción política debe cambiar de la nivelación del
presupuesto a más bien maximizar el crecimiento económico. La realidad es
que la clase política se opone a medidas en favor del crecimiento porque el
bienestar general que se lograría reduce la dependencia de aquellos que
reparten los beneficios que otros pagan. 
<p>
 Aunque podemos claramente afirmar que una reducción significante del tamaño
del gobierno aumentará substancialmente el crecimiento económico, también
tenemos que estar conscientes que a muchos políticos les interesa que esto
no se sepa. Mientras los medios de comunicación y los empresarios no estén
dispuestos a educar a la gente en este sentido, los políticos seguirán
insistiendo en perjudicarnos dándonos tanto gobierno. ©

<H2>PERU: APERTURA EDUCACIONAL</H2>
<p>
José Luis Sardón
<p>
LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En términos políticos y económicos, 1996 terminó resultando un
mal año para el Perú. Es temprano para calcular el daño que la toma de la
residencia del embajador japonés por guerrilleros del MRTA hará a la
economía peruana, pero ya sabemos que en 1996 se redujo notoriamente el
impulso en los procesos de estabilización y reforma estructural.
<p>
 Por primera vez desde 1991, en 1996 la inflación fue mayor a
la registrada en el año anterior, al alcanzar alrededor de 12%. Así, en el
campo fundamental de la estabilización macroeconómica se empieza a observar
un retroceso respecto de los notables logros obtenidos en la primera mitad
de la década.
<p>
En el campo de la reforma económica es verdad que se llevaron adelante,
contra las presiones demagógicas tradicionales, algunas privatizaciones
claves, como la de PetroPerú. Sin embargo, también es cierto que los agentes
económicos han recibido señales confusas que desdibujan el claro perfil de
las libertades económicas antes establecidas. Un ejemplo reciente de ello
son las marchas y contramarchas en la legislación laboral.
<p>
 No obstante este turbio panorama, a fin del año fue
promulgada una ley que permite alentar grandes esperanzas. Se trata del
Decreto Legislativo 882, Ley de Promoción de la Inversión en la Educación,
la cual —resumida en términos telegráficos— reintroduce los derechos de
propiedad en el sector y, por tanto, devuelve a la iniciativa privada la
responsabilidad de las decisiones básicas del proceso educativo.
En el Perú no existe sector más intervenido por el Estado que el educativo.
A nivel de los colegios, el Ministerio de Educación tiene todavía poderes
infinitos, herencia de la dictadura militar. A nivel de las universidades,
la situación era igualmente grave, desde que estaban sujetas a un único y
rígido esquema legal —la Ley 23733, de 1983—, al que debían ajustar su
organización y su funcionamiento. 
<p>
 Desde tiempos del general Velasco Ibarra, el régimen legal
de las universidades ha sido profundamente hostil a la iniciativa privada.
Siguiendo las ideas del movimiento de reforma universitaria de Córdova, de
1918, la dictadura militar instaló en este ámbito un modelo de organización
cooperativo, inspirado en el tabú ideológico según el cual las actividades
académicas deben ser realizadas por instituciones no contaminadas por la
búsqueda de ganancias.
<p>
 Con decisión y coraje saludables, la nueva ley ha atacado el
problema de fondo del sector, al reconocer los derechos de propiedad de las
entidades promotoras de las instituciones educativas particulares. Al
hacerlo, les brinda una marco legal básico que les asegura las libertades
indispensables para disponer la orientación axiológica, la organización
administrativa y el régimen de gobierno de este tipo de instituciones.
Así, pues, ya no serán los expertos reales o supuestos del Ministerio de
Educación quienes tomen las decisiones claves vinculadas al proceso
educativo. Tampoco serán los cuerpos colectivos asambleísticos, con sus
tortuosos procedimientos de votación anónima, perfectamente irresponsables.
Ahora éstas corresponderán a quienes invierten —y arriesgan— sus recursos
personales o familiares en instituciones educativas particulares.
<p>
 Al atreverse a romper prejuicios viejos y profundamente
arraigados en la sociedad peruana, el actual régimen ha dado muestras de una
importante capacidad para reinventarse a sí mismo. Viendo la evolución del
proceso político peruano en una amplia perspectiva, y recordando los muchos
sufrimientos y esfuerzos que ha costado llegar al punto en el que ahora
estamos, cabe desear que esta ley nos augure un mejor 1997. ©

<H2>DESARROLLO SOSTENIBLE</H2>
<p>
James M. Sheehan*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El "desarrollo sostenible" es la razón de ser de
numerosos tratados y convenciones de las Naciones Unidas. Se trata del
pretexto ambiental para ampliar el poder de las burocracias nacionales e
internacionales en controlar la economía. Este tipo de planificación central
se considera esencial para evitar que se agoten los recursos naturales y
para prevenir la contaminación y la destrucción de la diversidad biológica.
Los defensores del desarrollo sostenible exigen el establecimiento de un
marco de restricciones generales a las libertades individuales y económicas,
al comercio, al progreso económico y tecnológico, a la agricultura.
<p>
 El desarrollo sostenible se fundamente  en la idea de que la globalización
de la tecnología y del crecimiento económico son inherentemente destructivos
del medio ambiente. Sin embargo,  las habituales predicciones apocalípticas
sobre la extinción de recursos naturales nunca han resultado ciertas. Los
críticos del capitalismo no toman en cuenta sus poderosas fuerzas
innovadoras. En un mercado libre, los empresarios compiten en desarrollar
soluciones eficientes, a bajos costos, para enfrentar problemas de escasez
de recursos, permitiendo que la gente haga más con menos. El capitalismo ha
producido mayor número de innovaciones beneficiosas al medio ambiente que
cualquier otro sistema económico. Aunque tal dinámica no existe en las
economías socialistas, las propuestas para un desarrollo sostenible se
copian la planificación central socialista.
<p>
 La influyente Cumbre de Río de 1992 definió el desarrollo sostenible como
el principio fundamental de la política ambiental mundial. Desde entonces,
burócratas internacionales, activistas ambientales y funcionarios de
gobiernos nacionales han desarrollado un creciente cuerpo de leyes
internacionales que incluyen tratados y acuerdos como la Agenda 21, la
Convención Climática Mundial, la Convención de Biodiversidad y el Tratado de
los Océanos. Estos tratados imponen costosas regulaciones y mayores gastos
estatales en programas derrochadores de ayuda internacional. Tales
transferencias se canalizan a través de la Agencia para Desarrollo
Internacional del Departamento de Estado, la Facilidad Ambiental del Banco
Mundial y varias agencias de la ONU. Se trata del comienzo de un plan
ambiental centralizado.
<p>
 Las iniciativas ambientales promulgadas bajo el pretexto del desarrollo
sostenible también amenazan el futuro económico de las naciones en
desarrollo. "Ecoimperialismo" es una nueva tendencia bajo la cual las
naciones industrializadas imponen nuevas normas ambientales al resto del
mundo. Las naciones en desarrollo, con las poblaciones más pobres, son las
que más sufren por tales restricciones. Estos países temen que sus esfuerzos
por salir de la pobreza sean proscritos como "ambientalmente insostenibles"
por los países industrializados, los cuales no enfrentaron las mismas
prohibiciones cuando avanzaban en su propio desarrollo.
<p>
 Los patrocinadores del desarrollo sostenible no ven el papel que juega la
pobreza en la degradación ambiental. Las sociedades ricas gastan recursos
voluntariamente en mejorar la calidad ambiental, sin coerción gubernamental,
pero las naciones pobres no pueden darse ese lujo. Los habitantes de
naciones pobres son más vulnerables a enfermedades, desastres naturales y
deficiencias alimentarias; más de dos millones de personas mueren cada año
por falta de salubridad básica. Por lo tanto, una política mundial que
restrinja el desarrollo económico bajo el pretexto de la "sustentación" hará
daño tanto a la gente como al medio ambiente.
<p>
 La historia nos muestra que la planificación central causó una severa
degradación ambiental en la antigua Unión Soviética. Y la calidad ambiental
es un asunto local, no global, por lo que una exagerada centralización haría
más daño que bien. Lo lógico es que las naciones compitan entre sí con
diferentes enfoques. Los países que efectivamente desregulan sus economías
tienden a promover más rápidamente su desarrollo económico, instrumentan
tecnologías más limpias y crean la riqueza que hará luego posible mejorar el
medio ambiente.
<p>
La búsqueda del "desarrollo sostenible" a través de la expansión de la
autoridad reguladora y de burocracias internacionales conducirán
inevitablemente a fracasos económicos y ambientales. El verdadero desarrollo
sostenible puede ser alcanzado sólo por medio de las instituciones del
mercado: derechos de propiedad, intercambio voluntario y seguridad jurídica. ©

<A NAME="11">
<H2>REFORMAS INCOMPLETAS EN AMERICA LATINA</H2>
<p>
Alvaro Vargas-Llosa*
<p>
LONDRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- "El manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano" ha sido un
éxito de librería en toda América Latina. Allí los autores, utilizando algo
de humor, tratamos de destacar la incapacidad de nuestra clase política e
intelectual de renunciar a viejos mitos que por muchos años han dado
explicaciones erradas a nuestras miserias.
<p>
 Pero el libro también desafía ese nuevo y peligroso mito que sostiene que
en América Latina se está viviendo una revolución de libre mercado. Es un
peligro grave y latente que ese valeroso pero limitado experimento
reformista -reduciendo la inflación y el número de empresas estatales, a la
vez que muestra cierta hospitalidad hacia el inversionista extranjero- está
reanimando la oposición populista y debilitando la economía de mercado
precisamente porque se trata de reformas incompletas.
<p>
 Si menos empresas estatales, menor inflación y mayor inversión extranjera
fuesen suficientes para lograr estabilidad y prosperidad -un vuelco al
capitalismo- entonces América Latina sería ya próspera desde hace tiempo.
Tuvimos tiempos, antes de la ola estatista, cuando la política monetaria no
estuvo frenéticamente fuera de control. En esa época, la inversión
extranjera se veía por todas partes; tanto que todas nuestras revoluciones
socialistas -desde México en 1910,  Bolivia en 1952, Cuba en 1959 y Perú en
1968- llegaron al poder en nombre de la "soberanía". Pero la miseria persistió.
<p>
 Si una eficiencia macroeconómica fuera suficiente para lograr una sociedad
libre y próspera, ¿porqué sigue América Latina atrasada a pesar de haber
crecido a un promedio de 5% anual desde 1940, un crecimiento superior al
europeo en el mismo período?
<p>
 La respuesta es que las reformas parciales, concentradas en el manejo
macroeconómico, sin un claro compromiso con los derechos de propiedad,
mercados competitivos y sólidas instituciones judiciales y políticas
conducen a sistemas mercantilistas que le niegan a las mayorías las
oportunidades y los beneficios del crecimiento económico.
<p>
 Dos grandes debilidades afectan el actual proceso de reforma
latinoamericano. La primera es que se confunde a la empresa privada con el
capitalismo de libre mercado. La segunda es que el énfasis es en el manejo
macroeconómico, sin tomar en consideración el orden institucional. 
<p>
 Las privatizaciones no son panaceas. Privatizaciones mal concebidas han
reemplazado monopolios públicos con monopolios privados, transfiriendo la
propiedad mientras se protege el mercado y se fomenta escandalosamente la
corrupción. Un ejemplo son las telecomunicaciones. Por toda América Latina
los usuarios sufren de altas tarifas y mal servicio porque las empresas
telefónicas se vendieron a monopolios privados. Esto resulta obvio en Perú,
México y Argentina. Entonces los usuarios concluyen que el capitalismo, no
su ausencia, es la causa de tales abusos. No comprenden que eso es lo que
sucede cada vez que se transfieren mercados cerrados del control público al
privado.
<p>
 Problemas similares ocurren en gran variedad de servicios. El transporte
público en Buenos Aires está en manos privadas, pero cada ruta es un
monopolio de alguna empresa, por lo cual los argentinos están en contra de
la privatización.
<p>
 Esos desaciertos son utilizados por los enemigos de las reformas, como el
poderoso sindicato colombiano de las telecomunicaciones que controla a la
mayoría de los 14 mil empleados de la compañía de teléfonos colombiana. En
su oposición a la privatización, el sindicato apunta los defectos del
monopolio telefónico privado en Perú.
<p>
 Esta protección de monopolios también crea la percepción que liberalización
significa conceder privilegios a los ricos. Los 15 mexicanos que aparecen
entre los hombres más ricos del mundo se beneficiaron de privilegios
concedidos por el estado. A su vez, el pueblo mexicano tiene pocas razones
para apoyar un proceso que los ha empobrecido.
<p>
 Por todo el continente se mantienen sectores intocables, llamados
estratégicos. El mejor ejemplo es el petróleo. En Venezuela, a pesar de los
fenomenales $250 mil millones generados en los últimos 20 años por su
monopolio estatal petrolero, se estima que 80% de la población vive por
debajo del nivel de pobreza. Sin embargo, sugerencias sobre la privatización
del petróleo es respondida histéricamente, como sucede también en México y
con Codelco en Chile.
<p>
 América Latina ha ignorado olímpicamente la importancia de instituciones
tales como la justicia, la propiedad privada, monedas sólidas y hasta la
misma democracia. El resultado es un proceso de reformas con bases débiles
que invitan al desastre.
<p>
 La falta de reforma institucional está muy extendido. Los derechos de
propiedad no se toman en cuenta o son evadidos por el gobierno. Durante los
años 80, en un proceso silencioso, los campesinos peruanos de hecho
privatizaron 60% de las tierras que habían sido colectivizadas por una
reforma agraria socialista en los años 70. Sin embargo, cuatro millones de
parceleros andinos todavía no tienen sus títulos de propiedad.
<p>
 En México, el derecho de propiedad difícilmente existe con el artículo 27
de la Constitución que mantiene que "la nación" es la dueña de todas las
tierras. La muy mentada reforma del ejido no se ha traducido en derechos de
propiedad para los campesinos. No es posible confiar en las instituciones
peruanas luego que el presidente disolvió al Poder Judicial en 1992,
reemplazándolo por otro políticamente subordinado. Esa institución no evitó
que el Perú, según el informe de Amnistía Internacional de 1996, se
convirtiera en el país en América Latina con más presos políticos -unos
1.100- después de Cuba. En América Latina se aparta la libertad económica de
su esencial base política e institucional.
<p>
 En América Latina jamás se ha intentado una reforma liberal. El idiota
latinoamericano   siempre atribuye nuestros fracasos a conspiraciones: la
Doctrina Monroe, la United Fruit, el FMI, el Banco Mundial. El último
enemigo es el neoliberalismo, o sea las reformas de libre mercado.
Nuevamente se apunta donde no es. ©

<H2>LAS MENTIRAS ACADEMICAS</H2>
<p>
Walter Williams*
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Muchos ejecutivos de empresas se preguntan cómo
es que tantos de sus empleados que se han graduado de universidades no son
capaces de escribir un memorándum, hacer algunos cálculos sencillos o pensar
y expresarse lógicamente. Aquí les doy una muy pequeña parte de la
respuesta, contándoles sobre un reciente evento "educacional" en mi universidad.
<p>
 El Centro de Servicio Educacional y de Liderazgo Estudiantil de la
Universidad George Mason distribuyó invitaciones para la "Cena del Hambre",
un evento promocionado como educacional "para la comunidad estudiantil
acerca del efecto dramático del hambre a nivel mundial. La cena dramatiza la
desigual distribución de recursos como elemento que contribuye al hambre" y
la velada prometía promover "el análisis crítico, analítico e imaginativo
sobre los que basar decisiones éticas".
<p>
 Luego de donar dos latas de sopa o $3, a cada estudiante asistente a la
cena se le daba un boleto. El color del boleto que a cada uno, por suerte,
le tocaba indicaba su categoría en la cena. A 16 estudiantes le tocaron
boletos del "Primer Mundo" y ellos fueron conducidos formalmente a una mesa
cubierta con un mantel de hilo y adornada con flores, donde disfrutaron de
una cena de cuatro deliciosos platos, mientras escuchaban música clásica
interpretada por un dúo de flauta y oboe. Se les dijo que ellos
representaban al 15% de los habitantes de Estados Unidos, a los ricos.
<p>
 A otros 30 estudiantes le tocaron boletos del "Segundo Mundo". Comieron
hamburguesas con papitas fritas en platos de plástico y mesas sin mantel.
Les dijeron ser los representantes del 25% de la población que apenas logra
cubrir sus necesidades básicas.
<p>
 Los 140 estudiantes con boletos del "Tercer Mundo" recibieron un vaso de
agua y media taza de arroz, para que lo comieran con las manos, sentados en
el suelo. Se les informó que representaban a los pobres, 60% de la población
de Estados Unidos. 
<p>
 Un conferencista de la Coalición de los Sintecho expuso que el hambre y la
falta de viviendas se debe a la poca construcción a precios razonables que
hay, a falta de empleos que paguen salarios aceptables y a falta de
servicios de salud a precios asequibles. También dijo a los estudiantes que
Estados Unidos tiene suficientes recursos para acabar con la pobreza, pero
prefiere dedicarlos a gastos de defensa.
<p>
 Este evento, típico entre muchos otros que a diario se montan en nuestras
universidades, no fue más que propaganda, indoctrinación y mentiras
dirigidas a mentes jóvenes ya repletas de falsos sentimentalismos. La parte
más insidiosa fue la que fomenta la envidia. Darle agua y arroz al 60% de
los asistentes, con el mensaje de que ellos representaban a los pobres de
Estados Unidos, es repugnante.
<p>
 Los hechos son diferentes. Los pobres en este país son 14%. La obesidad es
un mayor problema nutricional entre los estadounidenses pobres que la
flacura. Los pobres de Estados Unidos comen más carne y tienen más espacio
en sus viviendas que los europeos de clase media. En 1993, los gastos del
gobierno federal, estadal y local para combatir la pobreza ascendieron a
$324.000 millones, mientras que el costo de la defensa nacional fue $291.000
millones.
<p>
 Para completar una velada de propaganda política, la medicina socializada
del Canadá fue presentada como el mejor ejemplo a seguir. Nadie mencionó a
los pacientes canadienses que cruzan la frontera para ser tratados en
hospitales estadounidenses ni el hecho de que cualquier ciudad grande de
Estados Unidos tiene más equipo médico moderno que todo el Canadá.
<p>
 Este centro propagandístico en mi universidad es apenas una pequeña muestra
del creciente equipo de indoctrinación presente en nuestras casas de
estudios, con el fin de confundir y engañar a nuestra juventud, promoviendo
la lucha de clases. Esto sucede por dos razones: la generación de Woodstock
ocupa hoy los cargos administrativos, mientras que los síndicos elegidos
para supervisar las instituciones universitarias no están cumpliendo con sus
obligaciones. ©

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's tax system is a disgrace. It severely penalizes  productive
economic behavior, especially by savers and investors  whose capital income is
subjected to as many as four layers of taxation.  It is so bewildering that
complying with its increasingly  complex forms, regulations, and other documents
consumes billions  of hours each year. And it imposes staggering economic damage
 reducing economic output by hundreds of billions of dollars  each year. The
real cost, however, is measured in lost jobs,  foregone income, lower living
standards, and reduced economic security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But lost prosperity is only part of the story. For many  Americans the most
reprehensible aspect of the current system is the way  it allows special
interests to manipulate the tax code for their  own advantage. Lobbyists with
enough money and access tilt the  playing field, creating special preferences
for the politically  well-connected. With the tax burden at record levels, many
taxpayers  understandably want to protect their earnings, but today's system  of
loopholes, credits, exemptions, and deductions fosters a  pervasive sense of
unfairness and encourages lawmakers to impose  even higher tax rates on income
which does not enjoy special status.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to solve America's tax problem is to adopt a flat  tax. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  No tax system is good for the
economy, but a flat tax would  allow significantly stronger economic growth by
replacing the  current tax code with a low rate, simple tax that removes the
bias  against savings and investment. Perhaps equally important, it would 
restore integrity to a tax system that has become synonymous  with
special-interest corruption. Under the flat tax, every taxpayer  plays by the
same rules. The multitude of forms required by today's  arcane tax law are
replaced by two simple postcards, one for  individuals' labor income and the
other for business and capital  income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the new Congress took a significant step in the right  direction by
delivering on its promise to pass badly needed  family tax relief to spur
economic growth. Taxpayers were  disappointed, however, when  just two years
after signing the largest tax  hike in U.S. history  President Clinton vetoed
the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995, which included about $220 billion in tax
relief over  a seven-year period. This relatively small package  which  amounts
to returning to the taxpayer just 2 cents of every dollar from  the $11.5
trillion in tax revenues the government expects to  collect over the next seven
years  included a $500-per-child tax credit,  a reduction in the capital gains
tax, and a modest expansion of  Individual Retirement Accounts. This legislation
marked the first  time since 1981 that Congress had voted to ease the tax
burden, but  it still did not come close to offsetting the negative impact of 
tax increases imposed by Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton  in 1990 and
1993; the 1995 tax cut was less than one-third the  combined size of these two
tax increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>As important as Congress's proposed tax cuts were to  taxpayers 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  and economic growth, they amounted
to using a Band-Aid  when what the situation really required was radical
surgery.  Serious, fundamental reform must be based on a recognition of two 
essential realities: Excessive taxation harms the economy, and the  liberal
notion that any problem can be solved by taxing the rich  is self-defeating.
Higher tax rates simply encourage wealthy  taxpayers, who already are
over-taxed, to hide, shelter, underreport,  and reduce their income. A much
better way to get the rich to  pay more, and one that will help lower - and
middle-income  workers by boosting savings and investment, is to cut tax rates.
The  attached <a href="tax_1.gif">chart</a> illustrates how lower tax rates in the 1980s  dramatically
increased the percentage of the income tax burden borne  by the rich. Even more
important, however, these reductions  triggered the longest peacetime economic
expansion in U.S. history and  led to the creation of 21 million new jobs.

<P>
</P>
<P>The conclusion is obvious: The tax system today is so  fundamentally flawed
that the only realistic solution is to scrap it and  begin again.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These flaws in the current tax code can be communicated by  emphasizing
three main themes:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Excessive tax rates.</B> The federal income tax has a top rate  of
39.6 percent. This means that successful entrepreneurs and  others with high
incomes receive barely 60 cents of benefit for every  dollar they contribute to
the nation's economy. The result is less  incentive to engage in productive
behavior, which leads in turn  to lower levels of work, saving, investment,
risk-taking, and  entrepreneurship. Added to this are state and local taxes,
which can  increase the total burden by as much as 11 percent, and the  Medicare
payroll tax, which adds another 2.9 percent. Moreover, while  those with lower
incomes may seem to be penalized less, usually  facing income tax rates of 15
percent and 28 percent, they also are  subjected to the full 15.3 percent
payroll tax, <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#1">1</A></B></TT> in
addition to state  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  local taxes. In other words,
almost all taxpayers are paying  about 40 percent of each additional dollar of
income they earn to  the government.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Tax Foundation, the average taxpayer in  1995 worked until
May 6 to satisfy the revenue demands of  federal, state, and local government.
This number could have dropped by  a day or two in 1996 if the President had
signed the legislation  approved by Congress in 1995. Nevertheless, the cost of
the tax  system remains the largest item in the average family's budget, 
exceeding the combined cost of food, clothing, shelter, and  transportation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Complexity.</B> Americans spend too much time deciphering  IRS forms,
regulations, and rulings. Several years ago, an  IRS-commissioned study
estimated that taxpayers spend 5.4 billion hours  on their federal tax returns 
more than all the man-hours used in  the entire automotive industry in America.
According to the  Tax Foundation, our tax system imposes $192 billion in 
compliance costs on the economy: not money sent to Washington, not  foregone
economic growth, but the cost of the lawyers,  accountants, lobbyists, tax
preparers, and man-hours needed to comply with  the current tax code. Of this
amount, three-quarters is due to the  federal income tax alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Bias against savings and investment.</B> The current system 
discourages Americans from saving and investing. Perhaps the  most pernicious
feature of the tax code is the way it subjects capital  income to discriminatory
treatment. If a taxpayer earns a dollar,  he can choose (after paying tax on the
money) to consume that  income or use it for savings and investment. If he
consumes the  dol
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  lar, he will pay very little, if
any, additional federal tax. If  he chooses to invest his earnings, he is
treated like a criminal.  Depending on the type of investment, the government
may  subject any returns to as many as four additional layers of tax; needless 
to say, however, it does not share in any losses if the investment  does not
perform as expected. Not only is this policy unfair, but it  has profoundly
adverse consequences for the economy since all  economic theories agree that the
only way to generate higher  wages and rising living standards is through
savings and investment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How Taxes Slow the Economy and Cost Jobs </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The biggest long-term problem with the tax system is its impact  on income
and productivity. Although much has been made of a  supposed decline in
middle-class incomes over the last 20 years,  all income groups have seen their
incomes rise over time.  However, our current tax system has made this increase
smaller than it  could have been.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is almost universal agreement among economists   even Marxists  that
incomes depend on productivity. Workers are  paid on the basis of what they
produce. Put another way, for incomes  to rise, productivity must increase, but
productivity increases  are closely linked to savings and to investment in
capital and  labor. Thus, the ability of workers to produce more is a function
of  increases in the quantity and quality of the machinery, tools,  equipment,
and technology with which they work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only systematic way to increase living standards and  income over time
is through more savings and investment in capital  and labor; in other words, in
the language of economics,  increased 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  capital formation boosts the
productivity of labor. Capital and  labor are what economists call complementary
goods, because  the value of each increases when they are linked together. A 
citizen who invests money in a pension fund will get a good return on  that
money if it is put to work producing goods. Labor, conversely,  will receive
higher wages as a result of the new investment made  possible by those
retirement savings.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>This link between labor and capital explains why farmers  in America earn
more than farmers in Bangladesh. American  farmers do not work harder. They are
not smarter. They earn more  because they produce more, and they produce more
because they work  with sophisticated machinery, equipment, tools, technology,
and  production processes. This is also why factory workers in  America,
Germany, and Japan earn more than factory workers in  Brazil, Nigeria, and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, our tax code imposes particularly harsh penalties  on
so-called capital income. Consider, for example, a family that  decides to
sacrifice by setting aside 10 percent of its income in  order to build up a
retirement nest egg. It invests the money in a  new company, exposing itself to
the possible loss of all its savings.  One would assume the government would
want to reward this type  of entrepreneurial decision, but just the opposite is
the case. If  the family's investment turns out to be a wise one, the 
government imposes at least three, and sometimes four, levels of tax. First, 
any income of the new company is subject to the corporate income  tax; second,
when the money is paid out as a dividend to the  shareholder, the income is
subject to the personal income tax; third,  if the family ever decides to sell
its stock, it must pay a tax on  capital gains; and fourth, if this family
invested very wisely and  helped 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  create tomorrow's Microsoft, the
government will tax the value  of its assets through the estate tax as its
members die. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As bad as all this sounds, it gets even worse. Policies such as  the
alternative minimum tax and depreciation often force  businesses and individuals
to overstate their income, making the real tax  rate even higher than the
statutory top rate. Our hypothetical  family could try to avoid some of these
taxes by simply putting money  in the bank, but even this has high costs. First,
the rate of return  on their savings will be lower because excessive taxes lower
the  demand for credit. Second, the government double taxes  savings. With the
exception of strictly limited IRAs and a handful of  other savings plans like
401(k)s, the money put into savings accounts  is taxed when it is deposited and
taxed on any interest it earns.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Needless to say, this pernicious anti-savings, anti-investment  bias in the
tax code sharply reduces the level of capital  formation. Many taxpayers look at
how the government punishes  success, decide that the financial sacrifice is not
worth it, and  consume their income rather than save and invest it. Ironically,
many  of these tax policies are designed to punish the &quot;rich,&quot; since 
they naturally have more money available for savings and  investment. The main
effect, however, is to reduce the wages and salaries  of people with lower and
middle incomes. Most wealthy people  can use tax shelters like municipal bonds
or hide their money  offshore to avoid taxes targeted at the so-called rich.
What these taxes  really do is discourage those on the lower rungs of the 
economic ladder from trying to become rich.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>By contrast, the tax cuts of the 1980s show what happens if  tax 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  policy reduces the burden on
working, saving, and investing.  Once the economy received an unambiguous tax
cut, everything  President Reagan said would happen if tax rates were reduced
began  to happen. The economy began its longest period of growth in  peacetime
history. Incomes began to rise, with the increase benefiting  all groups  rich,
middle-class, and lower-income (see <a href="tax_3.gif">chart</a>). And,  of course, the miraculous job
creation machine began: 21 million  new jobs were created during the Reagan
boom.

<P><B>How Washington has Hiked Taxes on  Children  </B><TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#2">2</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal taxation of families with children has increased  dramatically over
the past four decades. In 1948, the typical family of  four paid just 3 percent
of its income to the federal government in  direct taxes. In 1994, the
equivalent family paid 24.5 percent of  its income to the federal government. As
the <a href="tax_2.gif">chart</a> below  shows, when state and local and indirect federal taxes are
included, the  tax burden on that family equals 37.6 percent of its income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal income taxes have risen much faster for families with  children than
for other groups of Americans in the last four  decades. The root cause of this
growing anti-family bias is the  eroding value of the personal exemption. The
personal exemption for  children was intended to offset part of the annual cost
of raising  a child by allowing families to deduct an amount of money  from
their taxable income. In 1948, the personal exemption was  $600. This was equal
to roughly 17 percent of the median income of  a family of four (then $3,468)
and shielded 68 percent of  that family's income from federal income tax.
Families could  protect most of the remaining 32 percent by itemizing deductions
or  by taking the standard deduction. The result: In the late 1940s  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  early 1950s, the average family
with children paid little or no  income tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the past four decades, however, increases in the personal  exemption have
lagged far behind the rise in incomes and  inflation. As the value of the
personal exemption has declined, the  income tax paid by families with children
has increased. For the  personal exemption today to have the same value relative
to family  income that it had in 1948, it would have to have risen to $7,000 in 
1992, and to $8,000 in 1996. Instead, it is worth only $2,250 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second blow to family finances has been the increase in  Social Security
taxes, technically known as &quot;payroll taxes.&quot;  In  1948, workers paid a
2 percent Social Security tax on annual wages of  up to $3,000; 1 percent was
paid directly by the employee and 1  percent indirectly by the employer through
the so-called  employer share.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#3">3</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By 1995, combined Social Security taxes have risen to 15.3  percent of wages
(7.65 percent each paid by employer and  employee) on incomes up to $61,200.
While all workers have suffered  from skyrocketing payroll taxes, the burden has
been most severe  for working families with children. Social Security taxes,
unlike  regular income taxes, are not adjusted for the number of dependents  in
the family, so a working parent trying to support a family of  four feels the
sting of this tax far more sharply than a single person  at the same wage level.
The effect of Social Security taxation is  particularly severe on lower-income
parents; a family with an  income of $25,000 per year, for instance, pays $3,825
in payroll taxes.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Government Assault on Family Income. Direct federal  taxes as a share of
median family income has increased  dramatically over the past four decades. In
1948, effective tax rates equaled  3 percent of income for the average family of
four. By 1970,  they had risen to 16 percent; by 1994, to 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The income loss due to increased taxation has seriously  strained American
family finances and profoundly affected American  family life. Chart 4 shows the
effects of increases in federal  income and Social Security taxes since 1948 on
the finances of the  average family. Total pre-tax income for the median family
of four in  1994 was $56,608. <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt2.htm">4</A></TT></B>
 After taxes, this family's income fell to $45,104.  If federal taxes as a
percentage of family income were restored  to 1948 levels, the family's post-tax
income would have  been $10,084 higher, or $55,188. In other words, the loss of
income  in 1992 because of the increase in federal taxes as a share of  family
income, due to the falling value of the personal exemption and  the rise in
Social Security taxes since the late 1940s, was $10,084.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This income loss severely affects the ability of families to  support
themselves. For example, the typical family of four has  monthly mortgage
payments of $664 and grocery bills of $332. Thus  the $10,084 in income lost to
this family due to the 45-year rise  in federal taxes costs this family 15
months worth of mortgage  payments, or 12 months mortgage combined with six
months worth  of groceries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Solution: Tax Credits for Children</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two practical ways to reduce the tax burden on  families with
children: by increasing the value of the personal exemption  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  by allowing for the use of tax
credits. Although many positive  arguments can be made for increasing the
personal exemption,  the tax credit is better in the long run because it is less
complex  and can be used more effectively to reduce the tax burden on 
lower-income working families.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With an income tax exemption, income equal to the amount of  the exemption
is excluded from tax. However, the actual tax savings  a family receives from
such an exemption will depend upon the  tax rate to which it is subject. Thus,
for a family in the 15 percent  income tax bracket, a $500 increase in the
dependent exemption  decreases income taxes by $75. A $1,000 increase in the 
exemption, as some have proposed, decreases a family's tax burden by  $150. But
for a family in the 28 percent tax bracket, a $1,000 increase  in the personal
exemption reduces the income tax burden by $280   86 percent more tax relief
than for families in the 15  percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By contrast, under a tax credit, the amount of the credit is  deducted from
taxes paid  below the line, so to speak  directly  reducing tax liability. Also,
unlike a tax exemption, a credit gives the  same amount of tax relief to every
taxpayer, regardless of income or  tax rate status. The two examples below, one
for a family of four  earning $30,000 per year and the other for the same family
 earning $75,000 per year, show clearly how the credit works.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Example #1:</B> Under current law, a family earning $30,000 per  year
(which puts it in the 15 percent income tax bracket) has an  income tax
liability of $1,988. Because this family has two children,  the $500 child tax
credit reduces the income tax bill by $1,000  leaving a net income tax bill of
$988. This is a 50 percent reduction in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  family's tax burden.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Example #2:</B> Under current law, a family earning $75,000 per  year
(which puts it in the 28 percent income tax bracket) has a tax  liability of
$8,114. Deducting $1,000  $500 for each child   leaves this family with a net
income tax bill of $7,114. This is a 11  percent reduction in the family's tax
burden.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Crushing Burden of Social Security</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Much of this chapter has focused on the crushing burden of  taxes in general
and the anti-growth features of the income tax in  particular. No treatment of
federal taxation would be complete,  however, without some discussion of the
interrelated problems of  the payroll tax and the Social Security retirement
system. The need  for reform is critical. The Bipartisan Entitlement Commission 
estimates that Social Security faces an unfunded liability of $7.3  trillion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The burden of financing Social
Security has reached crisis  proportions. First, the payroll tax rate has risen
dramatically over  time. As the attached chart illustrates, the payroll tax has
jumped from  2 percent in 1949 to 15.3 percent today (the government  promotes
the fiction that half is paid by the employer and half by the  employee; in
reality, of course, the full burden is borne by the  worker in the form of lower
take-home pay). Of the 15.3 percent  payroll tax, 12.4 percent is dedicated to
Social Security, and 2.9 percent  is used to finance Medicare spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The rapidly rising tax rate is only part of the
problem. When  Social Security was created in the 1930s, only the first $3,000
of  in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  come was subject to tax. As the
graph demonstrates, however,  the amount of income subject to tax has
skyrocketed to more  than $60,000. The combination of these two effects  higher
tax  rates and an increase in the amount of wages that can be taxed   has caused
the payroll tax to become the biggest tax burden for  the majority of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     In 1937, the maximum tax bill for the program
was $60.  Twenty years later, in 1957, the maximum tax bill was less than $170. 
By 1977, it had climbed to more than $1,600. Today, a worker's  Social Security
tax bill can reach more than $7,500. The 2.9  percent Medicare portion of the
payroll tax compounds the burden,  particularly because there is no limit on the
amount of income  subject to this additional levy. This spiraling tax bill has a
negative  economic impact. The payroll tax is an unambiguous hindrance to  job
creation, lowering take-home pay and reducing the level of  labor-force
participation.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The other major flaw in the Social Security system is that it  is bankrupt.
Simply stated, the Social Security system has  promised benefits that cannot be

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1993, with nary a vote to spare in either the House or the  Senate,
President Clinton managed to obtain approval for the  largest tax increase in
history. In his second year, 1994, he proposed   but ultimately failed to get
enacted  an even larger tax increase  to pay for his government-run health care
scheme. Then, on  December 16, 1994, shortly after the mid-term elections that
put a  Republican majority in the House for the first time in 40 years, the 
President reversed himself and proposed a &quot;Middle-Class Bill  of Rights&quot;
which included modest tax cuts for families with  children, tax deductions for
education expenses, and an expansion of  Individual Retirement Accounts. This
effort was short-lived,  however, because the Administration spent much of the
rest of 1995  opposing the tax cuts proposed by the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton's record tax increase was a complete failure.  Tax
revenues are rising slower than they did during the  tax-cutting Reagan years.
The Clinton tax hike also hindered deficit  reduction. The following chart shows
CBO projections of annual budget  deficits after the Clinton tax increase. After
a modest decline, due  primarily to the economy's slow climb out of the early
1990s  slow
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  down, projected budget deficits
begin to climb rapidly,  reaching more than $400 billion after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Higher taxes also slow income growth for American families.  The following
charts illustrate the strong relationship between  taxes and family incomes.
During the Reagan years, income rose,  reversing the dismal economic performance
of the Carter years  when payroll tax hikes and bracket creep resulted in major
tax  increases. Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan's pro-growth policies were 
reversed by the Bush and Clinton Administrations. The effect on  the economy was
both predictable and inevitable: Incomes again  began to fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the 1980s, Reagan's opponents charged that the rich  were getting
richer and the poor were getting poorer. As the  numbers clearly show, however,
all income classes benefited from  the economy's performance. For the most part,
conversely, all  income classes suffer when the economy falters. The only
exception to  this trend has been during the Clinton Administration when, for 
the first time, the rich actually have become richer as the poor  have grown
poorer. The lesson from these statistics is clear:  Higher taxes slow the
economy, but the rich usually can adjust their  affairs to limit the damage,
leaving the poor most vulnerable to  the downturn.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Reagan Years</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some Americans have been seduced into thinking that the tax  burden is too
low. They have been told, often by the  establishment media, that &quot;Reagan
era&quot; tax cuts starved the government of  revenue and that higher taxes are
needed simply to offset the effect  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  these the massive cuts. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>As Chart 8 illustrates, however, there was no loss of tax  revenue during
the Reagan years. The effect is particularly  pronounced when one realizes that
the Reagan tax cuts were phased in, and  the economy did not actually receive a
net tax cut until January  1, 1983.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even using 1981 as the base year (and effectively blaming  Reagan for the
recession that began during Carter's last fiscal year),  tax revenues expanded
from $599 billion in 1981 to $991 billion  in 1989. Even after adjusting for
inflation, revenues grew by 20  percent. Compare this to the level of revenue
growth under the  high-tax regimes of Bush and Clinton. As the <a href="tax_8.gif">chart</a> shows, tax 
revenues grew faster under the Reagan tax cuts than they have in  recent years
under higher tax rates.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#7">7</A></B></TT></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics claim that the Reagan tax cuts caused the deficit to  climb, but
this accusation does not withstand scrutiny. As the  following graph shows, the
deficit began to increase two fiscal years  before Ronald Reagan became
President and continued to rise during  his first two years in office, until the
economy received a  significant net tax cut on January 1, 1983. From that point
on, the deficit  began to shrink, falling to about $150 billion by the time
Reagan  left office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps most important of all, the deficit would have continued  to fall had
Reagan's policies been left in place. In January 1989   the month Ronald Reagan
left office  the Democratically  controlled Congressional Budget Office
published estimates showing  what would happen to the deficit if Reagan's
policies were left in  place. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  As <a href=tax_10.gif">Chart 10</a> shows, the CBO
projected that the deficit would  continue to fall every year. Unfortunately,
both George Bush and  Bill Clinton raised taxes, causing economic growth to
falter and  discouraging taxpayers from earning and reporting more taxable 
income, and the deficit increased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The evidence is clear. Notwithstanding all the Washington  rhetoric, the tax
burden is too high. The deficit is the result of  excessive spending, not low
tax rates. The evidence of the past 20 years  confirms that high tax rates and
rising tax burdens mean higher  deficits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Abandoned Families</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Clinton campaigned for President by promising to give tax cuts  to working
families with children, but he did little to honor  this promise until after the
electorate brought new leadership to  Congress in 1994. Almost one year after
introducing his  &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights,&quot; Clinton again
abandoned families when he  vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which had as
its centerpiece  a $500-per-child tax credit for working families. Clinton 
claimed, among other things, that proposed reforms in the earned  income tax
credit (EITC) included in the plan would raise taxes on  families earning less
than $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yet a comparison of President Clinton's &quot;Middle-Class Bill  of Rights&quot;
(with its $300-per-child tax credit for dependent  children below age 13 in
families with annual incomes below  $75,0008) and the Balanced Budget Act vetoed
by Clinton (with its  $500-per-child tax cut forall children in families earning
up to  $110,0009) shows that the congressional plan would benefit 5.4 million 
more 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  low-income working families with
children than the Clinton  plan, even after accounting for changes in the EITC
in the  Balanced Budget Act. Many families with children and annual incomes 
below $24,000 would be denied the $300 child credit under  the Clinton plan
(receiving only the EITC) but would be eligible  for both the $500 child credit
and the EITC under the  congressional plan.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>Overall, Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would benefit  23 million more
children than the Administration's  $300-per-child credit. Congress would give
tax relief to 10.4 million families  with children who would receive no tax
relief under the Clinton plan.  In addition, there would be millions of families
under the  Clinton plan in which at least one sibling received tax relief but
others  did not. Taken together, the number of children not qualifying for  any
tax relief under Clinton would be 23 million less than under  the Balanced
Budget Act. These children would receive $15.4  billion in tax relief under the
BBA but nothing under the Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are three major reasons why the Clinton plan denies tax  relief to so
many families with children:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #1:</B> Clinton's tax cut benefits only families with  children
under age 13, denying tax relief to the families of at least 2.8  million other
children whose parents earn less than $30,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #2:</B> Clinton's tax cut phases out for families earning 
between $60,000 and $75,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #3:</B> The Clinton plan requires low-income families to  deduct
their EITC benefits from their income tax bill before  taking 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  the $300-per-child tax credit. By
contrast, the Balanced  Budget Act allows a low-income family to take the
$500-per-child  tax credit first, then receiving the full measure of the EITC on
top  of the child credit. <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#10">10</A></TT></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These three elements of the Clinton plan make it substantially  inferior to
Congress's $500-per-child tax credit, even considering  the reforms in the EITC.

<P>THE 104TH CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The centerpiece of the new Congress's Contract With  America was a
commitment to pass a plan that balances the budget by  2002, provides
substantial tax relief to families with children and  seniors, creates jobs, and
spurs economic growth. The new House  leadership rightly understood that tax
cuts must be included in any  credible balanced budget plan for both economic
and political  reasons. First, cutting taxes gives the economy a needed boost
while  Washington curbs spending in order to balance the budget.  Economic
models show that cutting taxes while balancing the budget  produces higher
economic growth than balancing the budget  without tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There also is a political element to cutting taxes while  balancing the
budget. Tax cuts  especially broad-based cuts such as  the $500-per-child tax
credit and capital gains reform  build  powerful constituencies to counter the
entrenched interests who  survive by exploiting government programs. In the
absence of tax  cuts, these pro-spending lobbies would be the only voices heard 
during any debate over balancing the budget. So, too, tax cuts  &quot;sugar-coat&quot;
the political pain of spending cuts. For example, families  in the typical
congressional district would receive some $54  million per year from the
$500-per-child tax credit. It is difficult to  imagine that any single federal
spending project of similar  magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the
same time. Thus, the  political advantages of tax cuts more than outweigh the
political  disadvantages of cutting spending.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The good news for hard-pressed families and businesses is that  tax cuts
were at the forefront of the agenda during the 1995-1996  budget debate and that
the new Congress fulfilled its promise to  deliver a balanced budget plan with
tax cuts to Bill Clinton. The  bad news is that Clinton vetoed the balanced
budget and tax cut plan   just two years after signing the largest tax increase
in history   and that the vision of taking taxpayers' money back from 
Washington became a victim of the &quot;green eyeshade&quot; negotiations over
how  to balance the budget.

</P>
<P><B>Tax Cuts in the House Plan</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On May 18, 1995, the House of Representatives passed, by a  vote of 238 to
193, its sweeping budget blueprint  formally known  as the budget resolution  to
balance the budget in seven years  while providing over $350 billion in tax cuts
to help families with  children and seniors and spur economic growth. Although 
many Washington insiders charged that the projected tax cut was  too large (some
$354 billion over seven years), it amounted to  returning to taxpayers only 3
percent of the $11.5 trillion in total  tax revenues the government expects to
collect over the same  seven-year period.

<P><B>Tax Cuts in the Senate Plan</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the Senate-passed budget resolution failed to  provide
explicit tax cuts. The Senate plan did allow for  unspecified tax cuts for
families and economic growth, but only if CBO  certified that the plan would
balance the budget in seven years.  Once this certification had been made, tax
cuts could be financed  with the $170 billion economic windfall, or &quot;fiscal
dividend,&quot; the  CBO estimated would accrue to the government from lower 
interest rates and the increased tax revenues generated by higher  economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Tax Cuts in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>After considerable negotiation, the House and Senate agreed  that the
Balanced Budget Act of 1995 (BBA) should contain $245  billion in tax cuts to
help families and spur economic growth. The  net size of this tax cut package is
reduced to $218 billion after  deducting $27 billion in revenues generated from
closing special  tax breaks for certain corporations and industries. Though this
 plan has come under considerable criticism from the media and  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  Washington elite, it actually is
rather modest: Overall, it  promises to return to taxpayers roughly 2 percent of
the $11.5 trillion in  tax revenues the government expects to collect over the
next  seven years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A full 65 percent of the tax cut plan is targeted to families,  especially
families with children. The &quot;crown jewel&quot; is a  $500-per-child tax
credit benefiting 28 million families raising 51  million children. The
remaining 35 percent of the plan is dedicated to  tax cuts to spur new
investment, jobs, and economic growth. A  small portion of the plan includes two
important tax provisions to  help seniors with their health care costs.

<P><B>1. $500-per-Child Tax Credit.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The centerpiece of the Republican Contract With America and  of
the House-passed plan is a $500-per-child tax credit benefiting  28 million
working families raising some 51 million children.  The $500-per-child credit is
&quot;non-refundable,&quot; meaning the total  value of the credit may not
exceed a family's income tax bill. But it  does provide uniform tax relief to
all families with incomes up  to $110,000 per year, thereby reducing a
low-income family's  tax burden by a much greater proportion than an 
upper-income family's. For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes  above
$110,000, the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000  in earnings
above the threshold (a range of $20,000), phasing  out fully at $130,000 in
income. For families with two children,  the two credits for which they are
eligible are phased out fully  at 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  $150,000 in income. For single
filers, the credit begins to  phase out at $75,000 in income.

<P>
</P> 
<P>There are sound policy reasons to cut taxes for families with  children:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Families with children are overtaxed.</B> In 1948, the
average  American family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to 
Uncle Sam. Today, the same family pays 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent  to
giving that family one month's mortgage payment and  one month's groceries.</B>
The average family spends $644 per month  in mortgage payments and $332 per
month on groceries. Thus,  the $1,000 in tax relief the congressional plan would
give to a  family with two children would help this family pay one month's 
mortgage and groceries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Millions of families stand to benefit.</B> The families of 51  million
American children (28 million taxpaying families) are eligible  for the
$500-per-child tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Family tax relief helps families in every state.</B> The typical 
congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for  a
$500 tax credit. Thus, families in the typical district would  receive $54
million per year in tax relief. Tables showing the benefits  of family tax
relief by state and congressional district are included  in the appendix to this
chapter.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate the  entire income
tax burden for 3.5 million taxpayers caring for 8.7  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  children.</B> These 3.5 million
families would receive over $2.2  billion per year in tax relief. Families with
two children earning up  to $24,000 per year would see their entire income tax
burden  eliminated by a $500-per-child tax credit, and families with three 
children and incomes as high as $26,000 also would have their  income tax bill
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Most families are middle-class</B>. The $500 child credit directs  89
percent of all benefits to families with adjusted gross incomes  below $75,000
per year  middle-income by any standard   and over 96 percent to families with
incomes below $100,000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cutting taxes for all families  regardless of income  is  fair.</B>
Congress's plan would cut the income tax burden of a family  of four earning
$30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income  tax burden of a family earning
$40,000 per year by 30 percent.  Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000
would see their tax  burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000
per  year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.

<P><B>2. Higher Standard Deduction to Reduce the Marriage Penalty.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current law, dual-income married couples who file a  joint return can
end up paying more taxes than two single  taxpayers filing individually. The BBA
takes a small step toward  reducing this &quot;marriage penalty&quot; by
increasing the value of the  standard deduction for these working couples
relative to the value of  the same deduction for singles. In 1996, for instance,
the ratio of  the standard deduction for married couples would be 1.68 of the 
value of the individual deduction. By 2005 and beyond, the ratio  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  be 2.00.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Tax Credit for Adoption.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The estimated two million families ready to adopt children  face huge
expenses during the adoption process, but current tax  law does not allow them
to deduct adoption costs from their tax  bill. The BBA plan makes a substantial
commitment to  encouraging adoption by giving adoptive families a tax credit of
$5,000 to  offset such expenses as adoption fees, court costs, attorneys' fees, 
and other related expenses. This credit is available in full to  families
earning up to $75,000 per year and phased out gradually for  families earning up
to $115,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Tax Deduction for Dependent Parents.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The current tax code provides little relief for the care of  elderly parents
or grandparents. The standard personal exemption  of $2,500 is available, but,
as with the dependent child  exemption, the value of the credit is greater for
middle - and  upper-income families than for modest-income families in the 15
percent  income bracket. For example, while the standard deduction of $2,500 
allows a family in the 15 percent bracket to lower its income tax  by $375, the
same deduction allows a family in the 28 percent  bracket to lower its tax by
$700.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA plan offers additional tax relief for the care of  parents and
grandparents in the form of an &quot;above-the-line&quot; deduction  of $1,000
per family member. Such a credit could help many  families 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  that prefer to care for elderly
relatives at home but cannot  afford the expense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>5. Favorable Tax Treatment for Private Long-Term Care.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although medical expenses are deductible from federal taxes  when they
exceed a certain percentage of income, long-term care  expenses today generally
are not tax-deductible. Under the  BBA, starting in 1996, long-term care
insurance generally would  be treated the same as accident and health insurance,
and  employers would be allowed to provide their employees with tax-free 
long-term care insurance just as they now often provide medical  benefits.
Eligible long-term care premiums and expenses for  qualified long-term care
services would be treated the same as other  medical expenses, and benefits
received under a long-term care  insurance policy would be tax-free (up to $175
per day).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Placing long-term care benefits on the same basis as health  care and
financing them under tax provisions similar to those for  medical insurance
could lead to substantial savings for state and  federal programs supporting
nursing home care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>6. Accelerated Payment of Life Insurance Benefits for the  Terminally
Ill.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current law, life insurance benefits are not taxed, but  insured
individuals and their families have no way to obtain  benefits prior to death
without a severe income tax liability  even  though many insurance companies are
willing to offer such  &quot;accelerated 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  benefits.&quot;  The BBA tax cut
plan would facilitate the practice  by which some insurance providers pay
benefits prior to death if  the insured person is terminally or chronically ill.
The plan would  allow such payments to be excluded from a taxpayer's gross 
income, just as payments to a surviving beneficiary now are. In addition,  it
would allow similar tax-exempt treatment for amounts  received from the sale or
assignment of a life insurance contract to a  qualified settlement provider.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>7. Reduction in Capital Gains Tax.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. tax code punishes capital investment by taxing  investment income
more than once: twice by taxing corporate and  individual income, and then a
third time by taxing capital gains.  The current maximum tax rate on capital
gains is 28 percent for  individuals and 35 percent for corporations, and these
gains are  not indexed to the inflation rate. By contrast, most of America's 
major economic competitors, such as Japan or Germany, either  exempt capital
gains from taxation or tax them at a greatly reduced  rate, often indexing the
basis of the gains to inflation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA lessens this penalty in two ways. First, it lowers the  effective
maximum capital gains rate to 19.8 percent for  individuals and 28 percent for
corporations. Second, starting January 1,  2001, it permits individuals to index
the value of assets to ensure  that they are not being taxed on purely
inflationary gains. The bill  also includes a 14 percent maximum rate for the
sale of small  business stock by a taxpayer other than a corporation. A
qualifying  small business may not have gross assets of more than $50 million at
 the time the stock is issued.

<P><B>8. New Individual Retirement Accounts.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), the bill  offers
another way for taxpayers to preserve the value of this  retirement savings by
creating a new American Dream IRA (AD  IRA). Contributions would be made from
post-tax income, but the  interest from such savings would not be taxed upon
withdrawal if  contributions have remained in the account for at least five
years  and the retiree has reached age 59 1/2. This is why the  American Dream
Savings account is sometimes known as a  &quot;back-ended&quot; IRA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Initially, contributions to the new ADS account would be  limited to $2,000
per taxpayer per year ($4,000 for a married couple),  but this amount would be
indexed to the rate of inflation in  subsequent years. The plan also allows
penalty-free withdrawals for a  first-time home purchase or to pay certain
educational or medical  expenses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>9. Alternative Minimum Tax. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Current tax law imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT)  on certain
individuals and corporations whose tax liability, after  deductions and credits,
falls below the level specified by the  alternative minimum tax rate. For
individuals, the minimum tax is  im
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  posed at graduated rates of 26
and 28 percent; for corporations,  it is imposed at 20 percent. In computing
their AMT, individuals  and corporations must adjust the annual amount they
deduct for  depreciated assets so that their tax liability does not fall below
the  AMT amount. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The bill modifies the AMT for both individual and corporate  taxpayers by
repealing the depreciation adjustment for  property placed in service after
1995, thereby conforming AMT  depreciation methods with the method used for
regular tax  purposes. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#11">11</A></B></TT>

<P><B>10. Estate and Gift Tax Reform
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA makes several important changes in the estate and  gift tax code to
reduce the punishing effects of this tax on estates,  especially the estates of
small businesses and farms. The bill  gradually increases the current effective
exemption of $600,000  to $750,000 in $25,000 increments through 2001, after
which  the effective exemption amount is indexed to inflation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the estates of small businesses, which do not have special  tax rules,
the bil effectively excludes an amount equal to $1.75  million of the business's
value from the decedent's  estate. <TT><B><A

<P><B>Economic Benefits of the Tax Cuts</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Washington insiders, especially those within the White House  and some in
Congress, argued throughout 1995 that cutting taxes  was inconsistent with the
goal of balancing the budget. They  claimed, for instance, that Washington &quot;could
not afford&quot; to reduce  taxes 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  while so much spending was being
cut to balance the  budget. These criticisms ignore the economic benefits that
would be  realized from combining tax cuts with a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To demonstrate this point, economists at The Heritage  Foundation used one
of the principal econometric models of the U.S.  economy to project the economic
effects of the tax cut elements of the  Balanced Budget Act. This analysis
showed that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The Balanced Budget Act with tax

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The reduction in taxes on capital (including
capital gains tax  relief) accounts for $86.3 billion of this additional GDP and

<P>
</P>
<P>While balancing the budget is good for long-term  economic growth, even more
growth is generated by the tax cuts in the  Balanced Budget Act. The tax cuts on
family income  primarily  the $500-per-child tax credit  would allow more
households to  save or spend their hard-earned money instead of sending it to 
Wash
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  ington, and this increased
private savings and spending would  help offset reductions in government
spending. In the long run,  increased private-sector activity with less
government  spending means a more efficient economy, more well-paying jobs, and 
a lower rate of inflation.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>During the early years of any reduction in government  spending, the economy
must adjust to a lower level of government  intervention. Businesses that
previously produced goods and services  for the government now must produce for
the private sector,  and workers previously employed by the government must find
 new jobs in the private sector. Analogously, there must be a  transition in
savings and investment. Money that would have been  invested in United States
bonds must be re-directed toward  private-sector securities, bonds, or other
vehicles. The transition from  government spending to private savings and
spending is necessary  and valuable, but it also takes time. In the short term,
returning  money to the private sector by means of the $500-per-child tax credit
 will help to offset these negative effects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax cuts on capital income  especially the capital gains  tax reductions
 are necessary to ensure a stronger economy.  There are two reasons for this:
First, reducing the tax on capital  gains lowers the cost of moving an
investment from an average  company to one that is exceptionally productive and
well-run. This  lowering of the &quot;switching&quot; costs means that investors
will play a larger  role in promoting well-run, productive companies. Thus, the 
economy as a whole is likely to be more efficient. Second, lower taxes  on
capital cause the cost of capital to fall. Lenders, for example,  do not need to
charge quite as much interest on capital loans to  recoup the taxes they paid
when making the capital available to a  bor
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  rower. Lower capital costs
usually mean more investment by  businesses in labor-saving equipment, which
commonly results in  increased labor productivity. This increased productivity 
translates into higher wages and, through the division of labor, more jobs.

<P><B>Individual Benefits of the Tax Cuts</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the 1995-1996 budget debate wore on, the &quot;green  eyeshade&quot;
negotiations over how to balance the budget overshadowed  the benefits of tax
cuts to families and individual taxpayers.  President Clinton often charged that
the $245 billion tax cut package  was &quot;extreme,&quot; given how much
spending had to be reduced in order  to balance the budget. But the plan
actually is relatively modest:  It amounts to returning just 2 cents of every
dollar of the $11.5  trillion the federal government expects to collect in tax
revenues  over the next seven years. At the same time, the Washington elite 
often dismissed the $500-per-child tax cut as insignificant. For  most
hard-working American families, however, $500 is not only a  significant amount
of money, but could mean the difference  between paying and not paying the
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For instance, the $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate  100 percent of
the income tax liability for families of four earning  up to $24,000 a year and
more than 50 percent of the income tax  liability for a family of four earning
$30,000 a year.  Moreover, while $500 may buy only a hammer in Washington, it
would  buy much more for the average family with two children. For  example, the
$500-per-child tax credit would cover any of the  following expenses for an
average family with two children:

specific problems, the flat  tax does the job.

certain key features.

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>One low tax rate -</B> All flat tax proposals have a single
tax rate  that applies to all income subject to tax. The actual rate imposed 
varies, but the upper limit would be about 20 percent. The  Armey/Shelby flat
tax legislation, for instance, begins with a 20 percent  rate which phases down
to 17 percent after a couple of years.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions -</B>
All pure  flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the tax code that bestow 
preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities.  Included in
this would be special tax breaks for businesses and  corporations and, for
individual taxpayers, the home mortgage interest  deduction, the charitable
contributions deduction, and the state and  local income and property tax
deductions. The combination of no  preferences, one low rate, and a generous
family allowance would  allow taxpayers to file their tax returns on a
postcard-size form.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>One-time taxation of income  -</B> Flat tax proposals are designed  to
eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by  ending the double
(and sometimes triple and quadruple) taxation of  income generated through
savings and investment. This is  achieved by ensuring that all income,
regardless of how it is earned or  how it is spent, is treated equally. Several
important tax policy  decisions flow from this principle, including repeal of
the estate  and gift tax, elimination of the double taxation of capital gains 
and dividend income, and neutral treatment of savings, either  through

have an immediate and dramatic impact.  Included among the many benefits are:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Faster economic growth -</B> A flat tax would spur
increased  work, saving, and investment. According to many economists, the rise 
in productive behavior would likely add one percentage point to  the annual rate
of economic growth. How significant is this?  An  increase in the growth rate of
just one-half of one percentage  point would boost an average family of four's
yearly income by  more than $5,000 after ten years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Instant wealth creation -</B> The value of financial assets is 
determined by the after-tax income they generate over time. By  eliminating the
second, third, and fourth layers of taxation on  capital income, a flat tax
therefore would significantly boost the value  of all income-producing assets.
According to Professor  Dale Jorgenson of the Harvard Economics Department,
enactment of  a flat tax would boost wealth immediately by some $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Simplicity -</B> 600-plus tax forms would be swept into the trash  and
replaced by two simple postcard-size forms. Wage, salary,  and pension income
would be reported on the individual form,  and business and capital income would
be reported on the  business form. Neither form would require more than a few
minutes  to compile, substantially reducing the 5.4 billion hour yearly  burden
of today's tax code.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fairness -</B> All taxpayers and all income would be treated  equally. A
taxpayer with ten times the taxable income of his  neighbor would pay ten times
as much in taxes. Successful entrepreneurs  no longer would be penalized by
discriminatory tax rates, and  no longer would the politically well-connected by
able to benefit  from special loopholes and preferences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>An end to micromanagement and political favoritism -</B> All 
deductions, credits, exemptions, loopholes, and preferences would  be
eliminated. Politicians would lose their ability to pick winners  and losers,
reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax code  to impose their values
on the economy. Investment decisions  would be guided by economic forces rather
than tax considerations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increased civil liberties -</B> The complexity of the tax code makes  it
nearly impossible for taxpayers or IRS agents to follow the law.  A greatly
simplified tax code would eliminate virtually all of  the conflicts and
controversies that make the IRS one of the  most feared agencies of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Help for families -</B> The flat tax does have one exemption: All 
taxpayers, based on family size, are allowed to protect a base  amount of income
from taxation. In the Armey/Shelby legislation, a  family of four would not pay
taxes on income of less than $33,300. As  the attached <a href="tax_13.gif">chart</a> illustrates, this
large &quot;tax-free&quot; amount results  in either zero or very low tax rates

negative effect on savings. Because  taxpayers are under the illusion that the

significantly.  This means fewer resources with which to finance future 
economic growth. Lower levels of saving mean less money for consumers  to borrow
to buy cars and fewer funds available to families looking  to buy their first
home. Perhaps most important, a low level of  savings means that businesses and

</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Estimates vary, but reliable projections indicate the  economy's
growth rate will be somewhere between one-half of one  percent and one percent
higher for several years following the  enactment of a flat tax. What does this
mean?  If the economy grows just  one-half of one percent faster each year, the
average family of four  will enjoy more than $5,000 of additional income by the

<P><B>Q. Will the elimination of the home mortgage interest  deduction hurt
the housing industry?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> Washington lobbyists representing real estate agents paid a 
consulting group to do a study of the flat tax. Not surprisingly,  the
consulting group concluded that a flat tax would lower  housing values by 15
percent. Independent research, however, has  found 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  this result to be completely
unfounded. Indeed, if the itemized  deduction is so critical, why did the
housing market do so well in  the 1980s when lower tax rates increased the
after-tax cost of  home mortgage interest payments by as much as 135 percent? 
As  the above <a href="tax_14.gif">chart</a> illustrates, there appears to be no correlation  whatsoever
between the value of the itemized reduction and either  home sales or home
values. Instead, the key to strong real estate  markets is a growing economy.
This is why realtors, homebuilders,  and homeowners will benefit from a flat
tax.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would charities be harmed if the charitable contributions  deduction
was eliminated?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As is the case with housing, the evidence from the  1980s clearly
shows that charities have nothing to fear from a flat  tax. The graphs
demonstrate that charitable contributions more  than doubled during the 1980s
even though the tax benefit of giving  fell sharply. Likewise, the numbers show
that charitable giving  rises with income; thus, since a flat tax will boost
income, charities  will benefit.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are there any groups that would pay more under a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The flat tax is not a free lunch. Aggressive users of tax 
shelters could face higher tax bills. Wealthy wage earners who create  business
losses to cancel out their tax liabilities will lose that  gimmick under a flat
tax. Many businesses could see their tax bills go up  as well. Needless to say,
the political prospects for a flat tax  increase to the extent that the number
of &quot;losers&quot; is minimized. This is  a strong argument for maximizing
the size of the tax cut that  accompanies tax reform.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do some opponents say dividends and interest would  not be taxed
with a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Probably because they do not understand how the  proposal works.
Under the flat tax, capital income is taxed at the  business level. What changes
is that corporate profits are no longer  subject to a second layer of tax at the
individual level. In a flat tax  system, a dividend check becomes analogous to a
worker's paycheck   an amount of money left after taxes already have been paid. 
Similarly, interest income is taxed by making it non-deductible to  the
borrower. A company with $1 million in interest payments,  for instance, would
pay $170,000 in taxes on that amount. To tax  this income a second time by
including it in the taxable income of  the recipient would be double taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to the capital gains tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Like all other provisions which double or triple tax income,  the
capital gains tax disappears. Individual taxpayers who buy  assets have paid
taxes on that income already. Whether that asset goes  up or down in value after
the purchase does not matter, since the  tax already has been paid. Businesses,
because they are able to  deduct the cost of purchasing assets, would pay tax on
asset sales.  This taxes the capital gain (if any exists), but avoids double
taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Will the estate tax disappear with a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Estate and gift taxes are one of the clearest examples of  double
and triple taxation in the current tax code and will be  eliminated under the
flat tax. In addition to protecting the taxpayer from  hav
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  ing to pay additional taxes on
income that already has been  taxed, abolishing the estate tax prevents family
businesses and  farms from being sold off for tax purposes. Another argument for
 elimination is that the estate tax drains private capital from the  economy
that is needed to finance future economic growth.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to the IRS?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No tax reform proposal will eliminate the IRS. As long as  the
government intends to claim $1.4 trillion of tax revenue,  some level of tax
collection authority will be required. By radically  simplifying the tax code
and eliminating the provisions that cause  the most conflict (alternative
minimum tax, depreciation,  capital gains, itemized deductions, etc.), the flat
tax will significantly  reduce IRS abuses. For individual taxpayers, the only
things the  IRS will be able to question are total income and number of
children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Will a flat tax encourage job creation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> A flat tax will encourage more jobs and higher wages by  boosting
incentives to work, save, and invest. In the long run, the  elimination of most
of the tax code's bias against savings and  investment will have the biggest
effect. As studies show, a flat tax  will encourage capital formation, leading
over time to higher levels  of productivity, increased wages, and more jobs. A
flat tax also  will have a more immediate impact on job creation, however, by 
making work more attractive. High tax rates drive a wedge  between what it costs
a business to employ a worker and how much  the worker receives in take-home
pay. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#15">15</A></B></TT>  By
increasing the cost  of labor, taxes lower the number of workers a company is
willing  to hire. Businesses do not exist to pay workers more than they  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 -->  worth. They exist to make money
and will hire only as long as  the value of each new worker's additional output
exceeds the total  cost of employing that worker.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When politicians enact policies that raise the cost of  employment, the
total cost of some workers will rise above the value they  bring their
employers. In the long run, a business has only two  options when faced with
this predicament: close its doors or lay off  workers who are net money losers.
Even workers who retain their  jobs pay a price. Taxes on labor income, whether
paid by employee  or employer, dollar for dollar, unavoidably reduce the amount 
that finds its way into their paychecks. Politicians may pretend  otherwise, but
every time the tax burden climbs, workers' after-tax  income declines. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#16">16</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> This depends on which flat tax is implemented. More 
specifically, it depends on the tax rate and whether the proposal  includes
limits on government spending. Even though lower rates  generally stimulate
economic growth and expand the tax base, at some  point they translate into less
revenue. A flat tax of 20 percent, for  instance, almost certainly would raise
more money than a flat tax  of 10 percent. The size of the personal
exemption/family  allowance also plays a key role, since the decision to protect
a certain  amount of income ($36,800 for a family of four in last year's Armey 
bill) generally means the rate on taxable income must be higher.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to a Treasury Department analysis leaked to the  media before the
1994 elections, the Administration estimates that  the Armey flat tax would
result in a $244 billion revenue loss to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  federal government in 1995. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#17">17</A></B></TT>  But this study contained
a  $500 billion error, as the Department later  admitted, <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#18">18</A></B></TT> and used the 17 percent
rate to analyze 1995 revenues even though the Armey  bill calls explicitly for
an initial rate of 20 percent (which would  be phased down to 17 percent). The
Treasury Department now  claims that, once fully phased in, the Armey flat tax
would &quot;cost&quot;  the government as much as $186 billion per year. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#19">19</A></B></TT> Because it  is based on
static analysis, however, this figure assumes that  reduced tax rates and
simplification would have no positive effect on  the economy. Hence, it ignores
the additional revenues produced  by income growth (as well as the binding caps
on federal  spending that the Armey bill would impose). <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#20">20</A>
</B></TT></P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>A flat tax almost certainly would reduce long-term  government borrowing
since its reduced rates and lower taxes on savings  and investment would boost
economic growth. Each year, the  result would be an expanding tax base and at
least some reduction  in outlays for certain means-tested programs and the 
unemployment compensation system. According to one relatively modest  estimate
of supply-side impact, a flat tax would increase the  economy's long-run annual
growth rate by just 0.5 percent. By the tenth  year, national economic output
would be $578 billion higher than  it would have been without a flat tax. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#21">21</A>
</B></TT> Government's &quot;share&quot;  of this production of additional goods
and services would be $86  billion in tax revenue. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#22">22</A></B></TT>  By the twentieth year,
added growth of  0.5 percent would mean an increase of more than $2 trillion in 
GDP and additional tax revenues in excess of $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The revenue feedback from higher growth, however,  probably would not be
enough in the short term to offset the revenue  lost from lower tax rates and
elimination of the multiple taxation  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  capital income. Achieving a
deficit-neutral flat tax (at least  the Armey version) would require some
restraints on  government spending. And if lawmakers were forced to balance the
budget  by 2002, the limit on spending increases would have to be even  more
stringent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What would happen to the price of other assets?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> While the potentially negative impact on housing markets  and
charity appears negligible, the positive impact on  income-producing assets
would be large. Assets such as stocks, bonds, and  rental properties produce a
stream of income over time. Their  market price is determined by calculating how
much income an asset  will produce over time, after taxes, adjusted to reflect
the fact that  income today is worth more than the same amount of nominal 
income in the future. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#23">23</A></B></TT>
 By lowering tax rates and removing  the double and sometimes triple taxation of
capital income, a flat  tax can increase dramatically the after-tax income
stream an asset  will generate. Thus, a low-rate flat tax would be a boon to
asset  holders, offsetting any theoretical fall in housing prices, and  would
stimulate a surge of new investment in the economy. Harvard  professor and tax
economist Dale Jorgenson estimates that a flat  tax would increase national
wealth by $1  trillion. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#24">24</A></B></TT>
 While this may seem high, it should be remembered that the mere  announcement
in Israel that a capital gains tax was being imposed caused the  Israeli stock
market to drop by 10 percent in just one  day.<TT><B>
<A HREF="ftnt2.htm#25">25</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax benefit everybody?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> If the question is considered narrowly (will anyone's tax  bill
rise?) it depends on how a flat tax is structured. If it is designed  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  give the government as much money
as it receives under the  current system, and if there is no consideration of
the increased  revenue that would accrue from new job creation and higher 
economic growth, then it is impossible to avoid having winners  and losers. In
the long run, a flat tax presumably would generate  higher incomes and living
standards, raising after-tax income even  for those who suffered a short-term
tax increase. At the same time,  it doubtless would have an adverse impact on
the lawyers,  accountants, and lobbyists who profit from the current law's
complexity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many flat tax proposals are structured so that few taxpayers,  if any, would
have higher tax bills. This is because they are  designed to go beyond
simplification and rate reduction to include  significant tax cuts for the
American economy. The Armey plan is  a good example. Using static estimating
techniques, it  probably would save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars
over a  five-year period. While the combination of a 17 percent tax rate  and
generous family exemption would not necessarily guarantee  lower tax bills for
everyone, few would face higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is there a way to stop politicians from raising tax rates in  the
future?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is no guarantee that a future Congress would not turn  a
simple flat tax back into a complicated &quot;progressive&quot; tax. This  is
the Achilles' Heel of tax reform. The sweeping reform enacted  in 1986 expanded
the tax base by eliminating many deductions  while simultaneously reducing tax
rates to keep the total tax burden  from climbing. Skeptics warned that
politicians could not be trusted  to honor this arrangement and that eventually
they would raise  rates while failing to restore deductions. This is exactly
what  happened 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  under Presidents Bush and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Could this happen with a flat tax?  Using the promise of low  tax rates,
could politicians take away the home mortgage interest  deduction, the
charitable contributions deduction, and other tax  preferences but then raise
tax rates in the future?  It is to reduce  this danger that most proponents of a
flat tax include an ironclad  provision to make raising tax rates difficult or
impossible. One way  to accomplish this would be by amending the Constitution to
 require that no increase in tax rates can be approved without the votes  of at
least three-fifths or two-thirds (in other words, a  &quot;super-majority&quot;)
of both the House and  Senate. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#26">26</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the income tax be abolished instead?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Proponents of a flat tax note that the current &quot;progressive&quot;
 income tax penalizes growth, discourages savings and  investment, imposes heavy
compliance costs, destroys jobs, and  reduces America's international
competitiveness. It has been pointed  out, moreover, that a flat rate income tax
reduces but does not  eliminate these negative effects. Thus, the question for
some  becomes whether it would be better to replace the income tax with a sales 
or &quot;consumption&quot; tax. Proponents of this view, including  House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX)  and Senator Richard Lugar
(R-IN), usually suggest that the  foregone revenue could be offset by spending
cuts, consumption taxes,  or some combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most advocates of a flat tax recognize that this argument is  sound, at
least in theory. Abolishing the income tax, closing down  the Internal Revenue
Service, and repealing the 16th  Amendment 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  clearly would be in the national
interest. Eliminating the  income tax would lead to even more economic growth
and job  creation than would occur under a flat tax. The real question is how 
that goal can be achieved.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Supporters of the flat tax have decided that eliminating the  income tax is
unlikely, especially in the short run. Because so many  interest groups benefit
from the current tax system, enacting a flat  tax will be difficult by itself.
Moreover, there is some concern  that proposals to abolish the income tax could
play into the hands  of those who want a national sales tax, or value added tax
(VAT),  as an add-on tax. If implemented as a replacement for the income  tax,
either of these would be less destructive to the economy. The  experiences of
other countries, however, suggest that, while a  VAT would be implemented with
the promise to eliminate other  taxes, politicians would never take that second
step. The country  then would have the worst of both worlds: income and direct 
consumption taxes. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#27">27</A> 
</B></TT>In any event, enacting a flat tax is probably  necessary as an interim
measure for those who favor eliminating the  income tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Probably, but it depends on how the flat tax is structured.  The
marriage penalty refers to the increased tax faced by a  married couple compared
to two single people with similar incomes.  This penalty is most severe for
couples with similar earnings. A flat  tax automatically solves part of this
problem by making it no  longer possible for one spouse's income to push a
couple into a higher  tax bracket. But the marriage penalty also arises if the
personal  exemption for a married couple is not twice the size of the  exemption

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  for those filing singly. The
Armey proposal solves this part of  the problem by giving a married couple twice
the exemption of  a single filer. Nevertheless, a flat tax could be constructed
that  retains this penalty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How would a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It would be possible to reform the personal income tax 
dramatically while leaving the corporate income tax untouched. As  mentioned
earlier, many businesses file using the personal tax code,  so many of their
problems would be solved by a flat tax that left  the corporate tax code
untouched. All flat taxes based on the  Hall/Rabushka model, however, reform
both the personal and  corporate income tax codes. Under the Armey proposal, for
instance,  the business rate would fall to 17 percent, the same as the  personal
rate, and the code would be reformed to eliminate the excess  taxation of
capital.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A flat tax can be designed to include substantial reform of  Social Security
and Medicare payroll taxes. Under current law,  payroll taxes totaling 15.3
percent are levied on the first $61,600 of  income (7.65 percent each from
employer and employee,  though economists agree that the entire tax is borne by
the  worker). <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#28">28</A></B></TT>
 Although none has reached legislative form, some flat tax plans  incorporate
the payroll tax, making the total marginal tax rate a  fixed percentage
regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax help America compete?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> The historic tax rate reductions launched by Ronald Reagan  in
the 1980s caused a chain reaction around the world. Many  nations 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 53 -->  followed America's example and
have made similarly  dramatic reductions in marginal tax rates in recent years.
In large part,  this worldwide shift in tax policy was driven by competition as 
investors avoided nations with high tax rates. Unfortunately,  America seems to
be one of the few nations that have not learned from  the experience of the
1980s. While the rest of the world has been  cutting taxes, the United States
stands alone as the only major  nation to impose sharply higher tax rates in
recent years. Investors  have reacted accordingly, and the amount of new
investment in  American jobs and business from overseas has dropped from an 
average of $175 billion per year during the low tax years of the 1980s to  an
average of only $108 billion in 1990. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#29">29</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to capital gains taxes and estate taxes under a  flat
tax?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> They are all eliminated. One of the key principles of a flat tax 
is that income is taxed only once. A capital gain for a financial  asset is
simply a reflection that the market's expectation of the  after-tax streams of
income from that asset has risen. Under a flat tax,  that income is taxed at the
business level when it is realized. To tax  the capital gain is double taxation.
Similarly, the estate tax is a  second layer of tax on earning which, under the
current system,  already has been taxed at least once.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the leadership of President Ronald Reagan, the 1980s were "the most prosperous decade in American history. That means the vast majority of Americans lived at a higher standard of living than they, or anyone else, ever had before, anywhere on the globe."<sup>1</sup>  Yet critics in the media and elsewhere persist in spreading such myths as the notion that the 1980s were a "decade of greed" in which the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Imagine what they would have said if the economic policy of the Reagan Administration had been a failure.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ronald Reagan did more than engineer sweeping economic policy changes that produced the longest peacetime economic boom in American history. He inherited an economic crisis of disastrous proportions that had been developing for over a decade and, in just a few years, reversed it to produce an economic triumph:<blockquote>

	Lest we forget, in 1979 the world stood on an economic precipice. Inflation ran 13.5 percent in 1980, real production dipped and the prime rate reached 21.5 percent. And economics as conventionally understood provided no intellectual tools for understanding this crisis, let alone curbing it. Worse, the affliction had struck the whole world, and threatened more damage to come.<sup>2</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the late 1970s, few believed the persistent inflation that had been building for more than ten years could be stopped, or at least stopped without creating another depression. Interest rates were at a crisis level, unemployment was rising, real incomes were falling, poverty was rising, productivity was stagnant, real economic growth had ceased, and both the dollar and the stock market were on the verge of collapse.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reagan reversed each and every one of these trends. How did he do it?  The Reagan economic policy consisted of four basic components:
<ul>
<p><li>Deep across-the-board tax cuts.

<p><li>Across-the-board domestic spending cuts.

<p><li>Deregulation.

<p><li>Sound monetary policies to restrain inflation.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reagan implemented these policies quickly, and the results were the largest peacetime economic boom in American history and nearly 20 million new jobs. To listen to many in the press today, however, it was a time of misery. The liberal establishment could not abide Reagan's policies of allowing people to keep more of their own money through real tax cuts and generally shifting power from the government to the people, so they have set out to tell us why the boom was a bust and the greatest of successes the greatest of failures.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is hardly surprising. Liberals must attack Reagan's success if they are to build popular support for higher taxes, more regulation, and higher government spending. But their attack can be countered. The following pages provide the evidence, point by point, with which conservative candidates can refute this attempt to rewrite history.
<p>

<b>What Happened to Federal Revenues?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There has been a great deal of rhetoric about Reagan tax cuts draining the federal Treasury. The reality is that revenues increased significantly.
<ul>
<p><li>Total federal revenues doubled, rising from $517.1 billion in 1980 to $1,031.3 billion, or just over $1 trillion, in 1990. In constant inflation-adjusted dollars, this was an increase of 26 percent.

<p><li>As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), federal revenues declined only slightly, from 19.6 percent in 1980 to 18.8 percent in 1990 (see <a href="1980st1.gif">Table 1</a>).

<p><li>Revenues from individual income taxes climbed from $244.1 billion in 1980 to $466.9 billion in 1990 (see <a href="1980st1.gif">Table 1</a>). In inflation-adjusted dollars, this amounted to an increase of about 25 percent.
</ul>

<p>
<b>What Happened to Federal Spending?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much also is made of the Reagan budget cuts, but the truth is that federal spending also rose significantly during the 1980s.
<ul>
<p><li>Federal spending more than doubled, growing from $590.9 billion in 1980 to $1,252.7 billion, or $1.25 trillion, in 1990 (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>). In constant inflation-adjusted dollars, this was an increase of 33.4 percent.

<p><li>As a percentage of GDP, federal expenditures grew slightly, climbing from 22.3 percent in 1980 to 22.9 percent in 1990 (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As discussed in detail in Chapter 7, government spending to aid the poor also climbed steeply throughout the 1980s and is now at record levels by every measure. The same is true of education, discussed in detail in Chapter 9.

<p>
<b>What Happened to Federal Deficits?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With federal revenues doubling in the 1980s, the cause of the deficit during that period is clear: runaway federal spending, which more than doubled (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>). Federal taxes in 1990 amounted to about 19 percent of GDP, which is approximately where they had been for 40 years, since the early 1950s. Federal spending in 1990 was about 23 percent of GDP, having fluctuated around 19 percent to 20 percent of GDP during most of the postwar era until the late 1970s. During the 1980s, taxes were maintained at historic levels as spending surpassed well-established historic levels, creating the deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In Reagan's last budget year, however, the federal deficit actually had been <i>reduced</i> to $152.5 billion (see <a href="1980st3.gif">Table 3</a>). As a percentage of GDP, this was about the same as the deficit for 1980.<ul>

<p><li>The deficit in fiscal 1989 was 2.9 percent of GDP, compared to 2.8 percent in 1980. Reagan had cut the deficit as a percentage of GDP by more than half from 1983, when it was 6.3 percent.

<p><li>This was accomplished by reducing federal spending from over 24 percent of GDP to about 22 percent of GDP. The problem is that federal spending started to escalate again after Reagan left office. By 1992, the deficit had leaped to a record $290.4 billion, about one-third higher than its highest level under Reagan.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Total federal debt held by the public was 44 percent of GDP in 1990 (see <a href="1980st5.gif">Table 5</a>). This was the same level as in 1940 during the liberal-supported New Deal. It was also less than publicly held federal debt as a percentage of GDP during the Kennedy Administration in the early 1960s. Publicly held debt totaled 113.8 percent of GDP in 1946, as a result of World War II, and remained higher than the peak achieved during the Reagan years until 1964; but it did not prevent an American economic boom during the postwar period.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics have argued that the 1980s deficits were financed by a massive influx of foreign investment which bought up federal debt and left America vulnerable to economic calamity if foreign investors decided to withdraw. In fact, foreign interests held 16.7 percent of public federal debt at the end of fiscal 1990, compared to 17.5 percent at the end of fiscal 1980.<sup>3</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another perspective is gained by comparing U.S. budget deficits in the 1980s with the average budget deficits in the same years for the seven leading industrial countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Calculating deficits as a percentage of GDP for all levels of government within each country, the OECD reports that the total U.S. government deficit (federal, state, and local) was close to the average deficit as a percentage of GDP for all of the G-7 countries throughout the Reagan years (see <a href="1980st6.gif">Table 6</a>).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Finally, interest rates fell sharply and consistently throughout the Reagan years despite deficits, as shown below. The academic literature shows no correlation between federal budget deficits and interest rates.<sup>4</sup>  By 1992, when the federal deficit hit a record $290.4 billion, interest rates were at their lowest levels since before 1980 (see <a href="1980st10.gif">Table 10</a>).
<p>

<b>What Happened to Inflation?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many Americans seem to have forgotten that inflation threatened the very foundations of the economy in 1980. Inflation soared during the late 1970s, reaching 11.3 percent in 1979 and 13.5 percent in 1980 -- a 25 percent rise in prices in just two years (see <a href="1980st7.gif">Table 7</a>). Many experts doubted that this problem, which had been gathering steam since the mid-1960s, could be cured without causing a deep recession or even a depression. Others doubted that it could be cured at all.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives argued that this inflation was caused by loose, "easy money" Federal Reserve policies which allowed the money supply to grow too rapidly. Thus, a central plank of the Reagan economic platform was a restrained monetary policy that would hold growth in the money supply to the level necessary to maintain real economic growth. Reagan pursued this policy vigorously and faithfully. The result: inflation was reduced by more than half, to 6.2 percent, by 1982 (see <a href="1980st7.gif">Table 7</a>), dropping to 3.2 percent in 1983 and remaining near that level for the rest of Reagan's term.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To this day, the inflation problem that seemed so threatening and unsolvable 15 years ago has not returned, but this overwhelmingly important achievement somehow has been all but forgotten in the debate over Reagan's economic policies and the 1980s.
<p>

<b>What Happened to Economic Growth?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By 1983, despite a steep recession in 1982 caused by the tight money policies needed to squeeze out the historic inflation level of the late 1970s, the Reagan policies of reduced taxes, spending, regulation, and inflation were in place. The result was an economic boom.
<ul>
<p><li>This boom lasted 92 months without a recession, from November 1982 to July 1990, the longest period of sustained peacetime growth in U.S. history and the second-longest period of sustained growth, including even wartime. It was also more than twice the average period of expansions since World War II.<sup>5</sup><p><li>The American economy grew by about one-third in real inflation-adjusted terms. This was the equivalent of adding the entire economy of Germany, East and West, or two-thirds of the economy of Japan, to the U.S. economy.<sup>6</sup><p><li>From 1950 to 1973, real economic growth in the U.S. economy averaged 3.6 percent per year. From 1973 to 1982, it averaged only 1.6 percent. The Reagan economic boom restored the more usual growth rate as the economy averaged 3.5 percent in real growth from the beginning of 1983 to the end of 1990.<sup>7</sup></ul><p><b>What Happened to Jobs?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A central feature of the 1980s was a boom in jobs and employment. The figures are impressive.<ul><p><li>From 1980 to 1990, 18.6 million new jobs were created, increasing U.S. civilian employment by almost 20 percent. Almost 23 percent -- about 4.2 million -- of these jobs went to black workers.<sup>8</sup>

<p><li>By 1989, unemployment for the year had fallen to 5.3 percent, the lowest since 1973 and down from 7.1 percent in 1980 (see <a href="1980st8.gif">Table 8</a>).

<p><li>In 1989, labor force participation reached a record 66.5 percent, and a record 63 percent of the population was employed. Black labor force participation also hit a record 64.2 percent in 1989, with female labor force participation reaching an all-time record of 57.5 percent in 1990.<sup>9</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, contrary to the myth makers' claims, most jobs created during the 1980s were good jobs.
<ul>
<p><li>About 82 percent were in the higher-paying, higher-skilled (technical, precision production, managerial and professional) occupations. Only 12 percent were in the lowest-paid, low-skilled service occupations, such as retailing and fast-food restaurants.<sup>10</sup><p><li>Data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that during Ronald Reagan's first term, 48.7 percent of new jobs were in the best-paid managerial and professional category.<sup>11</sup>  This trend continued into his second term.</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This represented a dramatic turnaround from the Carter years, when most new jobs were low-paid (defined as under $7,000 per year) and the number of high-paid jobs (more than $28,000 per year) actually declined.<ul><p><li>From 1977 to 1980, 41.77 percent of the new jobs paid under $7,000 per year in real 1984 dollars, while the number of jobs paying over $28,000 per year declined by 10 percent (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>).

<p><li>During Reagan's first term, only 6 percent of the new jobs paid under $7,000 and 46.7 percent paid more than $28,000 per year, both in constant 1984 dollars (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>). This was also a dramatic improvement over the 1973-1977 Nixon/Ford term, when 37.6 percent of the new jobs were in the low-paid category and only 11.2 percent were in the high-paid category (see Table 9).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics often claim the period from 1979 to 1984 produced more lower-paying jobs, but this is misleading because it includes two terrible Carter years, 1979 and 1980. In the words of <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> columnist Robert Samuelson, "Welcome to Economics Propaganda 101. The notion that the U.S. economy is producing mostly low-paying, unskilled jobs is an economic fiction."<sup>12</sup><p><b>What Happened to Interest Rates?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton likes to claim that he reduced interest rates to their lowest levels in 15 years. The truth is that they have been falling steadily ever since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 (see <a href="1980st10.gif">Table 10</a>).
<ul>
<p><li><b>The prime rate</b> declined from an average of 18.87 percent in 1981 to 6.25 percent in 1992 and was down to 6 percent in December 1992 from a peak of 21.5 percent at the end of 1980.<sup>13</sup><p><li><b>New home mortgage rates</b> declined from an average of 14.7 percent in 1982 to 8.07 percent in November 1992.<p><li><b>AAA corporate bonds</b> declined from an average of 14.17 percent in 1981 to 8.14 percent in 1992. In December 1992, the yield dropped to 7.98 percent.

<p><li><b>The yield on new three-month Treasury bills</b> declined from an average of 14.029 percent in 1981 to 3.45 percent in 1992. In December 1992, it fell to 3.25 percent.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Clearly, today's low interest rates are a product of the Reagan and Bush years, not the Clinton years.

<p>
<b>What Happened to Incomes?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Reagan economic boom also boosted family incomes across the board.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Real median family income</b>, adjusted for inflation, began to decline during the Carter years, falling almost 10 percent from 1978 to 1982. The Reagan recovery reversed this trend. Median family incomes started to rise again in 1983 and had increased by 11.3 percent by 1989.<sup>14</sup><p><li><b>Real average income</b> of U.S. households rose by 15.2 percent from 1980 to 1989, and by 16.8 percent from 1982 to 1989, compared to a 0.8 percent decline from 1970 to 1980.<sup>15</sup><p><LI><B>Real, per capita, disposable income</b> increased by 18 percent from 1982 to 1990. In other words, American living standards increased by almost 20 percent during the Reagan economic boom.<sup>16</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics often cite a decline in income from 1979 to 1989 among families in the lowest 20 percent of incomes. This, too, is thoroughly misleading. Average real household income for the bottom quintile declined by 14.2 percent from 1979 to 1983. The Reagan boom reversed this trend, increasing this group's average real income by 12.2 percent from 1983 to 1989. Average real income was still lower in 1989 than in 1979, but the problem was the precipitous decline in such incomes during the Carter years. Reagan engineered a major recovery in the lowest group's incomes (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Real household incomes also rose for every other 20 percent of income distribution during the Reagan recovery from 1983 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, by 10.1 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, by 10.7 percent.

<p><LI>For the second-highest quintile, by 11.6 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, by 18.8 percent.<sup>17</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Real incomes rose for every quintile from 1980 to 1989, and from 1980 to 1990 as well, but declined for every quintile during the Carter years from 1977 to 1980.<sup>18</sup>  A study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that real, per capita, before-tax income rose substantially for every quintile of income distribution from 1984 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the lowest quintile, by a stunning 68 percent.

<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, by 18.7 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, by 9 percent.

<p><li>For the second-highest quintile, by 12.1 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, by 19.2 percent.<sup>19</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, there is broad movement of people among quintiles in income distribution over time. This is clearly demonstrated in a Treasury study which found that 85.8 percent of those in the bottom 20 percent of income distribution in 1979 had climbed to a higher quintile by 1988, and 65 percent had moved up at least 2 quintiles.
<ul>
<p><li>Only 14.2 percent remained in the bottom 20 percent, and 14.7 percent of those who were in the bottom 20 percent in 1979 were in the top 20 percent by 1988. Thus, people in the bottom quintile in 1979 were more likely to be in the top quintile than in the bottom quintile by 1988.

<p><li>60 percent of those in the second-lowest 20 percent in 1979 had moved into a higher quintile by 1988.

<p><li>Of those in the middle 20 percent in 1979, 47 percent had moved up to a higher-income quintile by 1988 while fewer than 20 percent had moved down to a lower quintile.

<p><li>By contrast, a third of those in the top 20 percent in 1979 had fallen to a lower-income quintile by 1988, and over half (52.7 percent) of those in the top 1 percent in 1979 had fallen to a lower-income category by 1988.<sup>20</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The results of another study by Isabel Sawhill and Mark Condon of the liberal Urban Institute are similarly instructive.<ul><p><li>The average family income of those who were in the lowest quintile of income distribution in 1977 had increased 77 percent in real inflation-adjusted terms by 1986 when many had moved to higher quintiles.<p><li>The average for those in the second-lowest quintile in 1977 had increased 37 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the middle quintile in 1977 had increased 20 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the second-highest quintile in 1977 had increased only 10 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the top quintile in 1977 had increased only 5 percent in real terms by 1986.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to Sawhill and Condon, "when one follows individuals instead of statistical groups defined by income, one finds that, on average, the rich got a little richer and the poor got much richer."  The reason:
<blockquote>
	People who start at the bottom have nowhere to move but up, and are likely to do so as they become older, gain more seniority, and earn higher incomes. People who start at the top, some of whom may be there because of temporary sources of income like capital gains, have nowhere to go but down. This pattern, however, may be surprising to the general public, which has been led to believe that the poor were literally getting poorer over the past decade or two, and that the incomes of the rich were skyrocketing. This is simply not true.<sup>21</sup></blockquote>A widely cited study by the Democrat-controlled Congressional Budget Office erroneously contended that the top 1 percent of income earners received 60 percent of the income gains in the 1980s, but this study was filled with faulty calculations.<ul><p><li>Capital gains income was not adjusted for inflation.<p><li>Most capital losses and partnership losses were not counted.

<p><li>Appreciation of pension fund assets and homes was not counted, understating the gains of the middle and working classes.

<p><li>Incomes of the bottom 60 percent of earners were substantially undercounted, compared to incomes for those groups reported by the Census Bureau.

<p><li>Families were assigned to income quintiles with an adjustment for family size, but incomes in the study were not adjusted for family size.

<p><li>Most shocking of all, using this same flawed methodology, the real era of greed would have been the Carter years of 1977-1980 when, calculating income distribution in the same way, 100 percent of the income gains went to the top 1 percent.<sup>22</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his careful book <i>What Went Right in the 1980s</i>, on the other hand, University of California Professor Richard McKenzie presents the actual distribution of income gains based on data collected and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He shows the percentages of the increase in real, before-tax, per capita income actually earned by each quintile from 1984 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the lowest quintile, 15.4 percent.

<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, 11.9 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, 9.0 percent.

<p><li>For the second-highest quintile, 16.7 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, 46.9 percent.<sup>23</sup><p></ul>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The impression conveyed by these Tables, which show that the top 20 percent earned less than 47 percent of the income gains, stands in stark contrast to the picture painted by the Congressional Budget Office, with its top 1 percent earning 60 percent of the gains.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another widely cited article, "The Incredible Shrinking Middle Class," published in <i>American Demographics</i> for May 1992, argued that the middle class shrank in the 1980s as the number of families earning between $15,000 and $50,000 in constant 1990 dollars fell from 58 percent of all families in 1980 to under 53 percent in 1990. According to the article's own data, however, this occurred because the incomes of so many families grew above $50,000, not because middle-class incomes fell.
<ul>
<p><li>The percentage of families earning less than $15,000 in 1990 dollars fell from 17.5 in 1980 to 16.9 in 1990.

<p><li>The percentage of families earning more than $50,000 in 1990 dollars rose from 24.5 in 1980 to nearly 31 in 1990.

<p><li>During the 1970s, while the percentage of families earning $15,000 to $50,000 in constant dollars fell from 60.5 to 58, the percentage earning less than $15,000 rose from 16 to 17.5, while the percentage earning over $50,000 rose only from 23.5 to 24.5.<sup>24</sup></ul>Statistics on income growth for different percentages of the population will always show a somewhat larger income gain for the top group studied, whether it is 1, 5, 20, or some other percentage. There are two reasons for this.<ul><p><li>Income gains for the lower groups will be reduced because the fastest gainers from each group will climb to a higher group and be counted in that group's average incomes in later periods. For example, assume the income of a person in the bottom 20 percent rises from $5,000 in the first period to $20,000 in the second period. Because this puts him in the second-lowest quintile, his income will not be among those counted in the bottom quintile in the second period. Therefore, it cannot push up the bottom quintile's average for that period. On the other hand, all income gains for those in the top group will still be counted in that group's income in the second period, simply because there is no higher group into which the fastest income gainers can rise.

<p><li>Also, as incomes rise over time, the cut-off necessary to be in the top 1, 5, 20, or other percent will rise. This means the average income needed to qualify for the top group also will rise. For example, it may take $100,000 to be in the top 1 percent in the first year; in the second year, if the incomes of the next 9 percent rise rapidly during the year, it may take $110,000 to qualify for the top 1 percent. Many in the next 9 percent may climb over some in the top 1 percent to form a new top 1 percent with a higher average income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another device often used to distort income or other economic statistics for the 1980s is to include some of the Carter years or other bad years from the 1970s in the calculation. Periods cited may start with 1979, 1977, or even 1973. Shifting the starting point to years before 1981, when Ronald Reagan took office, lumps declining incomes or other declining economic performance from the 1970s with rising incomes or other economic performance from the Reagan years, leaving a distorted impression.

<p>
<b>What Happened to the Federal Tax Burden?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Probably the greatest myth about the 1980s is that Ronald Reagan slashed taxes dramatically for the rich, the result being that they no longer pay their fare share. The flaw in this claim is that it mixes tax rates with taxes actually paid and ignores the real trend of taxation.
<ul>
<p><li>In 1991 (the last year for which data are available), the top 1 percent of taxpayers in income paid 25 percent of all income taxes, the top 5 percent paid 43 percent, and the bottom 50 percent paid only 5 percent (see <a href="1980st11.gif">Table 11</a>). To suggest that this distribution is unfair because it is too easy on upper-income groups is nothing less than absurd.

<p><LI>The proportion of total income taxes paid by the top 1 percent rose sharply under Reagan from 18 percent in 1981 to 28 percent in 1988 (see Table 11).

<p><li>Average effective income tax rates were cut even more for lower-income groups than for higher-income groups. While the average effective tax rate for the top 1 percent fell by 30 percent between 1980 and 1992 -- and by 35 percent for the top 20 percent  of income earners -- it was reduced by 44 percent for the second-highest quintile, 46 percent for the middle quintile, 64 percent for the second-lowest quintile, and 263 percent for the bottom quintile (see <a href="1980st12.gif">Table 12</a>).

<p><li>The reductions for the lowest-income groups were so large because Reagan doubled the personal exemption, increased the standard deduction, and tripled the earned income tax credit (EITC), which provides net cash for single-parent families with children at the lowest income levels. These changes eliminated income tax liability altogether for over 4 million lower-income families.<sup>25</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics often add the Social Security payroll tax and argue that the total federal tax burden shifted more to lower-income groups and away from upper-income groups, but Reagan's changes were in the income tax, not in the Social Security payroll tax. The payroll tax was imposed by liberal members of Congress over the last 50 years, and it is they, not Ronald Reagan, who should be held accountable for its distributional effects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even if one counts the Social Security payroll tax, the share of total federal taxes increased for the following:
<ul>
<p><li>For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, from 12.9 percent in 1980 to 15.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the top 5 percent of taxpayers, from 27.3 percent in 1980 to 30.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the top 20 percent of taxpayers, from 56.1 percent in 1980 to 58.6 percent in 1989.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Similarly, even if one includes the Social Security payroll tax, the share of total federal taxes declined for four groups:
<ul>
<p><li>For the second-highest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 22.2 percent in 1980 to 20.8 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the middle 20 percent of taxpayers, from 13.2 percent in 1980 to 12.5 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the second-lowest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 6.9 percent in 1980 to 6.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li></ul>For the lowest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 1.6 percent in 1980 to 1.5 percent in 1989.<sup>26</sup><p><b>What Happened to Poverty?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite claims to the contrary, the Reagan economic recovery was effective in reducing poverty.
<ul>
<p><li>The poverty rate actually started to increase rapidly during the Carter years, rising by one-third from 1978 to 1983, when it climbed from 11.4 percent to 15.2 percent. It fell every year from 1984 to 1989, however, dropping by one-sixth from its 1983 peak to 12.8 percent in 1989.<sup>27</sup><p><li>The black poverty rate fell to 30.6 percent in 1989, the lowest on record except for 30.6 percent in 1978 and 30.3 percent in 1974.<sup>28</sup><p><li>From 1978 to 1983, the number of people in poverty increased by about 40 percent, from 24.7 million to 35.3 million. The Reagan recovery again reversed this trend, reducing the poverty population to 31.5 million -- a drop of 3.8 million -- in 1989.<sup>29</sup></ul><p><b>What Happened to the Misery Index?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A popular indicator of the economic performance of Presidents has been the so-called misery index, defined as the total of inflation and unemployment each year. Ronald Reagan engineered the largest reduction in the misery index in history. From 1980 to 1988 (Reagan's last year in office), the index fell by over 50 percent. At 9.6, the index in 1988 was lower than in any other year since 1970, except for 1972 (see <a href="1980sc1.gif">Chart 1</a>). The Presidency of Jimmy Carter, who invented the term, still holds the record for the highest misery indices.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Harvard University economist Robert Barro has developed a different index of Presidential economic performance. His Economic Report Card for Presidents includes the change each year in inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and growth in Gross National Product (GNP) under each President.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of all eleven Presidents since 1949, Reagan ranks both highest (first term, 1981-1985) and second-highest (second term, 1985-1989) in economic performance under Barro's index. Jimmy Carter ranks lowest, and George Bush ranks fifth (see <a href="1980st13.gif">Table 13</a>).

<p>

<b>The Boom in Charity</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1980s has been labeled by some as the decade of greed. The truth is that total giving to charitable causes in the United States grew at a record pace.
<ul>
<p><li>Between 1980 and 1989, charitable giving in real terms increased by 5.1 percent per year, compared to 3.3 percent per year from 1955 through 1979.<sup>30</sup><p><LI>Charitable giving per capita in real terms grew at a rate of 4 percent per year, double the rate of 2 percent per year from 1955 to 1979.<sup>31</sup><p><li>Between 1980 and 1989, charitable giving in real dollars rose by 56 percent to $121 billion.<sup>32</sup></ul><p><b>The Surge in Manufacturing</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another myth holds that during the 1980s, the U.S. economy was deindustrializing as manufacturing became uncompetitive and fell into decline. The facts tell a vastly different story.<ul><p><li>Manufacturing output rose by 38 percent in real inflation-adjusted dollars between 1980 and 1989. This left output at 23 percent of GNP in 1989, compared to 21 percent in 1980, and higher as a percentage of GNP in 1988 and 1989 than in any other year since World War II.<sup>33</sup><p><Li>The total industrial production index rose by about 30 percent from 1980 to 1990 and by about one-third during the Reagan recovery years of 1983 through 1990, about the same as total real economic growth. The more narrow manufacturing production index rose even faster, climbing by 39.5 percent from 1980 to 1990 and by 43.5 percent from 1983 to 1990.<sup>34</sup><p><li>Manufacturing productivity tripled, climbing almost 42 percent from 1980 to 1990 at a rate of 3.5 percent per year.<sup>35</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result of this sharp rise in productivity, U.S. manufacturing employment fell from 20 percent of total employment in 1980 to 16 percent in 1990, even though manufacturing output was near its highest-ever levels of GNP.<sup>36</sup>  Producing more and more with fewer workers is a sign of economic health and efficiency, not of failure.<p><b>Understanding the Trade Deficit</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics have made much of the fact that our trade deficit climbed from $19.4 billion in 1980 to $109.1 billion in 1984 and $145.4 billion in 1987 (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). This is among the most meaningless economic statistics collected, however, and in no way indicates economic weakness during the Reagan years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Deficits in the international trade in goods and services inevitably are balanced by surpluses in international capital transactions. A dollar earned overseas by selling to the United States ultimately can be used only to buy U.S. goods and services or to invest in the U.S. Therefore, dollars sent overseas for imports must be used to buy U.S. exports or to invest in the U.S., and total transactions must always balance. Even if the money is held overseas, the foreigner is investing in dollars, which is also a form of investment in the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An inflow of capital investment means generally that foreign interests, instead of buying U.S. goods and services with money made by selling imports to the United States, are using it to buy capital assets in the U.S. The result is a deficit in trade, but a surplus in capital transactions. This is not a sign of economic deterioration, however; it is a sign of economic strength. It means the U.S. economy is strong enough to attract foreign capital investment to fuel still more economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This was the chief cause of the rising U.S. trade deficit during the 1980s. President Reagan's reductions in taxes, regulation, and inflation made the U.S. economy very attractive to foreign investors. The results:
<ul>
<p><li>Foreign private investment in the U.S. more than doubled in just two years, from $42.6billion in 1980 to $88.8 billion in 1982.

<p><li>By 1986, it had more than doubled again to $187.5 billion; by 1989, it had climbed to $205 billion (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The effect is similar when U.S. citizens who have been investing abroad bring their capital home. Foreign interests, because they no longer are receiving dollars from those investments, also cannot use these dollars to buy U.S. goods and services, offsetting U.S. purchases of goods and services overseas. Everything else being equal, the trade deficit will rise when U.S. capital investment overseas falls and U.S. investors put their money in the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This was another cause of our rising trade deficit; but like the inflow of capital investment from abroad, it is a sign of strength, not deterioration. It means the economy is attracting the increased investment that leads to still more economic growth. Under Ronald Reagan, the net outflow of U.S. investment abroad collapsed in just two years, from $111.2 billion in 1982 to $20.6 billion in 1984 (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). Reductions in taxes, regulation, and inflation appealed to U.S. investors just as they did to foreign investors, leading them to bring their capital home to invest in the booming U.S. economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Booming economies also tend to run trade deficits, however. They import increased inputs from around the world to fuel their rapidly increasing production, which may be sold to their increasingly rich citizens rather than abroad, leaving a net trade deficit.<sup>37</sup>  This happened in the U.S. as the Reagan economy boomed from the end of 1982 to the middle of 1990, as discussed above.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 1980s trade deficit certainly did not come about because U.S. goods and services were not competitive.
<ul>
<p><li>U.S. exports of manufactured goods rose by 90 percent from 1986 to 1992, compared to an increase of only 25 percent for the other leading industrial countries in the OECD. Our share of world manufacturing exports consequently increased from 14 percent in 1987 to 18 percent in 1991.<sup>38</sup><p><li>U.S. services are recognized as the best in the world, and net exports of those services multiplied by several times from 1986 to 1992.<sup>39</sup>  Exports accounted for 15.2 percent of GNP by 1990, up from 12.2 percent in 1980.<sup>40</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The U.S. ran a trade deficit for almost all of its first 100 years as it attracted tidal waves of foreign investment and its economy boomed, bringing in goods and services from around the world to fuel production and create the mightiest economic machine in world history. Trade deficits were an indication not of economic weakness, but of the skyrocketing economic strength of the new, free-market nation. During the Great Depression, by contrast, the U.S. ran trade surpluses.<sup>41</sup> Similarly, during the 100 years from Waterloo in 1815 to World War I in 1914, Britain dominated the world economically but also ran chronic trade deficits. As Wall Street financier Evan Galbraith has written, "America in the 1980s should be compared to Britain in its glory years, and not to a country that shows a trade deficit because its products are not competitive."<sup>42</sup>
<ul>
<p><li>By 1990, the trade deficit was falling rapidly, declining to $76.8 billion in that year (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). Of course, U.S. economic growth all but disappeared during these years as well, as the Reagan boom ended in 1990. Just as the 1980s trade deficit was not a sign of economic weakness, its decline around the turn of the decade clearly was not a sign of economic strength.

<p><li>In line with the decline in the trade deficit, foreign investment in the U.S. dropped precipitously, from $205.2 billion in 1989 to $65.5 billion in 1990 and $48.6 billion in 1991 (see Table 14).

<p><li>Private U.S. investment abroad also had climbed back up to $71.4 billion in 1991, and the weak U.S. economy no longer was pulling imported inputs to fuel booming growth. These factors accounted for the decline in the trade deficit, just as their reverse accounted for its earlier increase.

</uL>
<p>
<b>Understanding Debt and Wealth</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The claim that the U.S. economy was burdened with excessive debt during the 1980s also is erroneous. Wealth soared, creating the capacity for additional debt, but debt generally increased no faster than the trends of earlier decades.
<ul>
<p><li>Real personal assets rose by nearly $6 trillion, from $15.5 trillion in 1980 to $21.1 trillion in 1990, an increase of 36 percent. Because the increase in real personal assets was three times the increase in personal debt (which rose by $1.8 trillion), personal real net worth rose by $3.8 trillion, or 29 percent.<sup>43</sup>

<p><li>The stock market more than tripled in value from 1980 to 1990, a larger increase than in any previous postwar decade. The ratio of corporate debt to market value of corporate assets was the same in 1989 as in 1969.<sup>44</sup><p><li>Total debt liabilities of all private, non-financial sectors rose at a rate of 5.4 percent, compared to 6.15 percent for the 1950s and 5.01 percent for the 1960s.<sup>45</sup>  This hardly seems excessive when compared to previous years.<p><li>Total real private net worth rose by $4.3 trillion from 1980 to 1989, at which time it totaled $17.1 trillion in constant 1987 dollars, an increase of about one-third over 1980.<sup>46</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another popular complaint has been that the United States became a "debtor nation" in the 1980s. The value of foreign investment in the United States exceeded the value of U.S. investment overseas for the first time in 1988, we are told, and the "investment deficit" has grown every year since then.<sup>47</sup>  This actually is another sign of economic strength, however, because it means the United States became more attractive to the world's investors.
<ul>
<p><li>U.S. investment income from overseas continued to exceed income to foreign interests from U.S. investments over this period by close to $20 billion per year.<sup>48</sup>  This indicates that a true valuation would show that U.S. investments overseas still are worth more than foreign investments in the U.S.<p><li>U.S. investments overseas are older on average, and their historical costs,upon which "debtor nation" statistics are based, underestimate their current market value even more as a result. The government has yet to find a way to account fully for the current market value of investments.

<p><li>Much foreign investment is equity investment, which represents no burden of repayment by the American people. It simply will earn the value of what it produces, with no guarantee of profits, as the increased capital invested enhances overall economic growth, jobs, and incomes.<sup>49</sup></ul><b>The Bottom Line: International Comparisons</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The United States today remains the wealthiest society on earth.<ul><p><li>Adjusting exchange rates for purchasing power parity, which compares what goods and services families in each country can buy, the U.S. standard of living is easily the highest in the world, exceeding West Germany's by about 25 percent and Japan's by about 40 percent.<sup>50</sup><p><li>Measured by actual physical conditions, the United States has much more and newer housing space, more cars per capita, more appliances, and more comforts generally than Western Europe, Japan, or any other nation or region.<sup>51</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some have argued that America is declining because the U.S. economy has fallen as a percentage of the world economy during the years since World War II. This decline stopped in about 1975, however, with the U.S. economy remaining through the 1980s about 34 percent as large as the rest of the world's economies combined.<sup>52</sup>  Moreover, after World War II, with most of the world's other major economies devastated by the war, the U.S. economy accounted for a huge percentage of the world economy.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One should hardly be surprised to find that our share of the world economy has declined as these other economies have rebuilt; nor should one be surprised or alarmed that it has declined further as some of the world's underdeveloped countries have learned to prosper. Far from indicating a problem with U.S. economic strength, these developments benefit the U.S. as well as the rest of the world. It would have been unrealistic indeed to expect our unusual postwar position relative to 
other countries not to decline as a result of the mutually beneficial and hoped-for economic development of those countries.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Virtually from the beginning of government in human society, death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable. The passing of well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors. Most nations today impose death, estate, and inheritance taxes, and the United States is no exception.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This ancient practice, however, is beginning to change. Motivated by mounting evidence that death-related taxes may hold back the economic well-being of the living, several countries and American states recently have repealed their taxes on estates or significantly scaled them down. The U.S. Congress also is reexamining the wisdom of these taxes. Two bills, one in the House and another in the Senate, call for outright repeal of the estate and gift tax,<sup>1</sup> and dozens of others in both chambers propose significant modifications that give taxpayer relief.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Support for these proposals still comes primarily from advocates of limited government. But a growing number of liberals recently have shown a keen interest in repeal. Like so many critics of the estate tax, these new critics are disturbed by the growing evidence that this tax:
<ul>
<p><li>Reduces economic growth, hurting the jobs and incomes of the very people that wealth redistribution was intended to aid;

<p><li>Increases the cost of capital, slowing down research and development and the use of machines that would increase worker productivity -- and thus wages;

<p><li>Keeps interest rates on home loans and other major purchases higher than they should be; and

<p><li>Raises very little money -- in fact, it may cost the government and the taxpayers more in administrative and compliance fees than it raises in revenue.
</ul><p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current wealth taxation policy stems from the mistaken view that redistributing income leads to the redistribution of economic power. Nearly a century of wealth taxation, however, shows that well-to-do Americans (including a great number of middle-class families) simply find ways of legally avoiding the tax collector. Not only do they save less and consume more of their income, thus benefiting from the lower taxes on consumption, but they also make less productive investments, such as large life insurance policies and substantial charitable contributions, thus reducing the chances that their death will leave a large taxable estate. The policy of using the estate tax to redistribute economic power actually leads to a distorted distribution of consumption and a less productive economy. Both of these unexpected outcomes worsen the economic condition of the less economically powerful.
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Founders understood the critical importance of reducing legal barriers to economic opportunity as the best public means of allowing every citizen to achieve economic fulfillment. This understanding found a home in the original U.S. Constitution, where direct taxes on wealth and income were prohibited except in time of national emergency. But soon after the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (which lifted the ban on federal income taxation) in 1913, the federal government began a 60-year effort to create a more democratic economy through the forcible redistribution of wealth. That policy has imposed costs on economic growth as well as fundamental liberties.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is time to repeal the estate, gift, and generation-skipping tax. The case for this turns on three factors: the diminishing importance of the estate tax as a federal revenue stream; the failure of the tax to achieve its public policy objectives, principally the creation of economic benefits for lower-income Americans; and the continuing damage the tax exacts on the economy in terms of jobs, output, and growth. Transcending all of these factors is the growing appreciation that wealth taxation infringes on fundamental liberties and is inconsistent with the principle of limited government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the estate tax were repealed, the effect on the economy would be significant. According to an econometric study conducted by Professor Richard Wagner of George Mason University, the effect of the estate tax on the cost of capital is so great that within eight years, a U.S. economy without an estate tax would be producing $80 billion more in annual output and would have created 250,000 additional jobs and a $640 billion larger capital stock.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An analysis by The Heritage Foundation using two leading econometric models also found that repealing the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect on the economy. Specifically, the Heritage analysis found that if the tax were repealed this year, over the next nine years:
<ul>
<p><li>The nation's economy would average as much as $11 billion per year in extra output;

<p><li>An average of 145,000 additional new jobs could be created;

<p><li>Personal income could rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current projections; and

<p><li>The deficit actually would decline, since revenues generated by extra growth would more than compensate for the meager revenues currently raised by the inefficient estate tax.
The estate tax has few friends, other than tax attorneys, and raises very little revenue at a heavy cost to the economy. It generates complex tax avoidance schemes. The hardest hit by the tax are small businesspeople who work hard to pass on an enterprise of value to their children. And its bias against saving and wealth generation is the antithesis of the American dream.

<b>HOW WEALTH TAXES BEGAN IN AMERICA</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current public policy on the taxation of intergenerational wealth stems from roots laid down in the American Revolution and, oddly enough, in the Revolutionaries' efforts to create a society in which all citizens would be free to become as wealthy as their talents allow. As with so many principles that trace back to the Revolutionary period, the liberty to acquire and dispose of personal property became, by the 20th century, subsidiary to another element of the country's founding: the drive to create democratic equality of economic opportunity.<sup>2</sup><p><b>The Early Years</b><p>Alexis de Tocqueville paid considerable attention to the views Americans held about wealth and economic opportunity when he made his famous tour of the early Republic in 1831. On the one hand, Americans had a nearly universal disdain for aristocracy and any non-republican show of wealth. But on the other hand, nearly everyone with whom Tocqueville became acquainted wanted desperately to be rich:
<blockquote>
	I do not mean that there is any lack of wealthy individuals in the United States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money has taken stronger hold on the affections of men and where a profounder contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property. But wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in the full enjoyment of it.<sup>3</sup></blockquote><b>Removing Barriers to Wealth.</b> The democratization of acquiring wealth constituted the touchstone of the new civilization that the Revolutionaries sought to build. Theirs was a battle against barriers erected in the Old World to prevent the rise of the common man. For centuries, laws had been applied differently to rich and poor people. The Revolutionaries overturned this by embracing the legal principle of equality before the law, extending it to all free Americans, and giving it the sharp legal teeth of natural liberty in one's life and property. They freed labor and capital from taxes, turned over to communities virtually all regulation of commerce, and tried in many other ways to remove government from everyday life. This truly was the age of the individual. Liberated from the oppressive economic and social networks that had surrounded the Crown and that prevented ordinary people from rising, the Revolutionaries emphasized the importance of allowing the marketplace rather than birth and influence to be the measure of personal worth. As Gordon Wood writes in his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of this period,
<blockquote>
	A man was now praised for having arrived and risen "without friends," for having been "the architect of his own fortune," or for never having been "borne on the shoulders of patronage."  For many Americans the ability to make money -- not whom one knew, or who one's father was, or where one went to college -- now became the only proper democratic means for distinguishing one man from another.<sup>4</sup></blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nothing epitomizes the zeal of the Revolutionaries for fundamentally altering the process of acquiring wealth better than the rapid abolition of primogeniture and the narrowing of entail. The ancient practice of primogeniture settled the entirety of an estate on the first-born male, thus leaving the remaining male children and all female children without inheritance. Primogeniture made birth order rather than merit the principal cause of wealth. Thus, dullards were as likely as commercial geniuses to end up ruling vast properties and exercising immense social and political influence. Entail nicely complemented primogeniture by making it all but impossible for real estate to leave a family, no matter how desirous a family one day might be to part with the property or how badly they managed their estate. Together, primogeniture and entail put a gigantic weight around the neck of economic progress and reduced the rate of commercial improvement to an obese creep.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thomas Jefferson, himself initially a victim of primogeniture and then its beneficiary upon the death of his older brother, vigorously opposed both practices and saw legislation that he had written in 1777 abolishing primogeniture passed by the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1785. Within a few years, every new state government had followed Virginia's lead, and no subsequent state ever seriously considered allowing it. For Jefferson, the reform of entail and abolition of primogeniture were two of the most important actions taken in the early Republic to create "a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of ancient or future aristocracy, and a foundation laid for a government truly republican."<sup>5</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even a cursory reading of the Revolutionary texts underscores this unrelenting focus of the Founders on removing barriers to the wealth-creating process. Early American public policy was not aimed at redistributing wealth or at restraining its growth. Rather, the early Republic pursued a public policy of removing obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic self-improvement. If an egalitarian theme was present in early American public policy, it was the theme of equality before the law, which often meant the elimination of legal privileges that gave one class an economic advantage over another.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This attitude to wealth creation can be found in the Constitution of the United States. A straightforward reading of the following paragraph from Article I, Section 9 appears to prohibit all direct taxes, which would include a prohibition against taxes on income and wealth: "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken."<sup>6</sup><p><b>Changing Attitudes Toward Wealth and Taxation</b><p><b>National Emergencies.</b> It was generally accepted during the 19th century that Congress had extensive authority to bend the Constitution during times of national emergency. For example, the writ of <I>habeas corpus</i> could be suspended in times of war or rebellion in order to advance the public good. Thus, it appeared well within Congress's emergency powers to impose taxes on wealth and inheritance to meet the wholly unexpected revenue requirements of the federal government during dangerous times.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress wasted no time in testing its expansive wartime authority: Taxes on estates were imposed first during the Quasi-War with France (1797-1799), but repealed in 1802. Still, had it not been for the Civil War, it is possible that after 1802, the 19th century would have been an uninterrupted period of no estate or intergenerational wealth taxation. But the expenses of the Union government exhausted its revenue sources so quickly that President Lincoln and the war Congresses employed the emergency clauses of the Constitution to enact the first modern intergenerational wealth tax. The Revenue Act of 1862 revived the death tax of the Quasi-War Congress and recrafted it into a true inheritance tax. Congress repealed the tax on wealth in 1870.<sup>7</sup><p><b>Wealth Seen As an Obstacle to Economic Opportunity.</b> While costly national emergencies occasionally challenged the idea of unrestricted wealth creation and ownership, more important in the long run was a change of attitude in some circles toward the relationship between wealth and economic opportunity. Between 1880 and 1916, the party of Lincoln overflowed with political warriors who saw no American problem that could not be solved by righteous citizens wielding the policy tools of the newly powerful federal government. Just as they had overcome the Southern assertion of states' rights, they would be victorious over the growing concentrations of private economic power that they viewed as fundamentally threatening the bedrock American value of equal economic opportunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reform Republicans created many tools for achieving their "new economic democracy," but perhaps none was so important to this project as the income tax. If the principal post-war threat to the Republic came from the great wealth that industrialization created for a few privileged people, and from the opportunities this wealth provided for corrupting political institutions, reformers needed above all else a legal means of redistributing wealth, thus diffusing the political power that great wealth provided. In 1894, Congress took its first tentative step in this direction by passing the Income Tax Act. Significantly, the heart of the Act was a definition of gifts and inheritances as income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Supreme Court wasted little time in striking down the Income Tax Act. In 1895, the Court ruled<sup>8</sup> that the Act constituted a direct tax on certain forms of income that did not meet the Constitution's requirement of apportioning such a tax according to population. Without a change in the Constitution, the Court concluded, all such efforts at taxing income would fail to pass constitutional review.<p>The constitutional obstacle was removed in 1913 with ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment.<sup>9</sup>  Congress quickly passed an income tax in 1914 that levied a 3 percent rate on all incomes above $30,000 (about $900,000 in 1996 dollars).<sup>10</sup>  It then launched the modern period of estate and gift taxation through the Revenue Act of 1916.<p>The Revenue Act of 1916 established rules for valuing a decedent's estate, for capturing taxable lifetime transfers into the estate, and for determining those transfers made for inadequate consideration and those that became effective only upon death. It created exemptions and deductions that continue to be a part of estate tax law today. Most important, the Act introduced progressive taxation into estate tax policy.<sup>11</sup>  This element clearly distinguished its public policy objective from earlier death taxes: The central mission of federal estate and gift taxation would be the redistribution of wealth.<sup>12</sup><p>After 1916, and despite a few efforts to retreat from estate and gift taxation immediately following World War I, taxes on intergenerational wealth transfers became a permanent feature of U.S. tax policy.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The history of wealth transfer taxation between 1920 and 1976 consisted largely of expanding the tax base for estate and gift taxes and increasing the tax rates. Congress raised the top marginal rate for estate taxes to 40 percent in 1924. In 1932, the top rate rose to 45 percent and the gift tax became permanent. The imminence of hostilities in 1941 caused Congress to search for additional revenues and led to a further increase in the top rate on estates to 77 percent.<sup>13</sup><p>Figure 1 shows the rapid increase in estate and gift tax collections after the end of World War II. Intergenerational taxes grew significantly in both amount and rate, even when adjusted for inflation. This growth probably stemmed as much from the demographics of the transfer taxes as from high tax rates: The late 1960s saw the beginning of generational transfers from those Americans who had weathered the storms of depression and world war. Transfers increasingly consisted of small businesses and farms as well as stocks, bonds, and liquid assets. And as the number of taxable estates containing businesses grew, so did the pressure for estate tax relief.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress recognized in 1976 that a tax intended to diminish the power of great wealth more frequently ended up taxing ordinary Americans who had accumulated taxable estates through nothing more than frugality, entrepreneurship, and plain hard work. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 addressed the concerns of these people through a number of policy changes. Specifically, the Act:
<ul>
<p><li>Unified the estate and gift tax, enabling taxpayers to apply unused gift tax allowances as deductions against their taxable estates;

<p><li>Lowered the top marginal rate to 70 percent and expanded the marital deductions for estates of moderate size; and

<p><li>Created special rules for estates consisting primarily of small businesses and family farms that allowed more of these entities to escape estate taxes altogether.<sup>14</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress's eagerness in 1976 to address problems with intergenerational taxation coincided with a growing understanding among many academics and politicians that high tax rates retard economic growth.<sup>15</sup>  This growing awareness led the Congresses of the 1980s to reduce the economic influence of intergenerational taxes, largely through tax cuts and more generous deductions. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 in particular reflected this redirection in public policy. For example, the Act created the unified credit that currently exempts the first $600,000 in an otherwise taxable estate from any tax liability,<sup>16</sup> and it cut the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. In addition, the Act further liberalized the rules governing the tax valuation of closely held businesses and farms, and lengthened the period of time for the payment of estate taxes by estates that contain such businesses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With few exceptions, tax and budget bills passed between 1981 and 1992 adhered to the policy changes contained in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.<sup>17</sup>  Even in the largest tax increase in U.S. history -- the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- it was apparent that revenue goals and not class warfare was the basis of the wealth tax provision. While Congress added two new rates (53 percent and 55 percent) to the estate and gift tax, these still did not go above Ronald Reagan's top rate. And while two new income tax rates (35 percent and 39.6 percent) were enacted, they still were just over half as high as the nearly confiscatory rates that prevailed during the administration of Dwight Eisenhower. In fact, without notice, wealth transfer tax policy has lost its ideological thrust. Its philosophical justification is disappearing; its roots in public policy are growing shorter every year; and its retention depends on its value as a revenue-raiser. But as we shall see later, besides its damaging impact on wealth creation and economic well-being, as a source of revenue it is more trouble than it is worth.<sup>18</sup><p><b>THE ESTATE AND GIFT TAX TODAY</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current federal wealth transfer law is a confusing maze through which only the bravest taxpayers will travel without an experienced guide. The federal government taxes intergenerational wealth transfers through the estate, gift, and generation-skipping tax systems.<sup>19</sup><p>

<b>The Estate Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The largest component of the federal government's three-part wealth taxation system is the estate tax. Current estate tax law itself has three basic elements: 1) definition of the estate tax base, or the gross estate of a decedent; 2) deductions that can be made from the gross estate to arrive at the taxable estate; and 3) the computation of estate tax liability.
<ol>
	<p><li><b>The Tax Base</b><p><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Estate tax law defines the gross estate of a decedent as the "fair market value"<sup>20</sup> of all personal or real property, wherever situated and however tangible, at the time of the decedent's death.<sup>21</sup>  This valuation of an estate's property attempts to quantify such property at its "highest and best use."  However, the valuation of a business or a farm on a "fair market value" standard may actually result in an artificially low value of an ongoing enterprise. For example, consider a start-up business in a good part of town. The owner suddenly dies, and his son wants to continue the business. If the estate tax value is determined by recent sales of other businesses located near it, then it may be valued at an amount well above its actual worth based on the cash generated by the business (which may even be operating at a loss in this early phase). This makes a big difference to an estate, since the business may have to be sold in order to pay the estate tax because the son is unable to raise a loan to pay the tax. In 1976, Congress recognized this negative potential of the "fair market value" rule and permitted estates containing small businesses and farms to be valued at their present use rather than at their "market value."<sup>22</sup><ul><p><li><b>Insurance Policies.</b> Special rules apply to the value of insurance policies contained in the decedent's estate. If the life insurance policy is paid out to benefit the estate, of if the decedent either held a property right in the policy or conveyed this property right within three years of death, then the value of the policy is added to the gross estate. A similar rule applies to annuities.<sup>23</sup><p><li><b>Joint Property.</b> A property rights rule also applies to property owned jointly by the decedent and someone other than the decedent's spouse: Such jointly owned property is included in the gross estate to the extent of the ratio of consideration furnished. With respect to property owned jointly with a surviving spouse, only 50 perc
ent of such property becomes a part of the gross estate.<sup>24</sup><p><li><b>Gifts.</b> Gifts and other transfers of property made by the decedent well before death also may be included in the gross estate if the decedent retained the ability to influence the disposition and use of such property. Similar inclusion in the gross estate applies to gifts that occur only upon death. However, sales of property and other alienation of property from the decedent's control made throughout his or her life are not included in gross estate.</ul>	

<p><li><b>Deductions</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Once the total value of an estate has been calculated, numerous deductions may be applied. The result of these subtractions from the gross estate is the taxable estate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	
The first category of deductions relates to direct expenses of the estate: All costs of the funeral, of legal claims against the estate, of the executor's administration of the estate, and of mortgages paid by the estate may be deducted.<sup>25</sup>  Second, the value of property passing to the decedent's surviving spouse may be deducted. Finally, the estate may deduct the value of all charitable bequests to organizations recognized by the federal government as tax-exempt.

<p><li><b>Tax Liability</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The taxable estate that results from the application of these gross estate deductions is taxed according to a somewhat cumbersome four-step process. First, the value of all taxable gifts made over the decedent's lifetime is added to the net estate. Second, a before-credits tax is calculated by multiplying this "grossed up" estate by the relevant tax rate. Third, this before-credits tax is reduced by subtracting the tax on all gifts made after 1976. And fourth, various credits are applied to the remaining sum.<sup>26</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are four credits available for estate tax reduction, but by far the most significant is the unified transfer tax credit.<sup>27</sup>  This credit is a flat $192,800, which equates to a $600,000 net taxable estate. Thus, the unified transfer tax credit means that current law exempts from taxation all otherwise taxable estates up to $600,000 in value.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Above $600,000, estates face a tax rate table that contains no fewer than 17 different rates, ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent. There is a 5 percent surcharge for estates between $10,000,000 and $21,040,000, intended to phase out the unified transfer credit. Thus, estates up to $21 million in value face a 60 percent marginal rate.<sup>28</sup></ol><p><b>The Gift Tax</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second layer of federal wealth transfer taxation is the levy made on lifetime property gifts. Like the definition of gross estate, current law contains a host of decisions that the courts and executors must make in determining the value of taxable gifts.<ol>	<p><li><b>The Tax Base.</b> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most difficult decision of all is the one that must be made first: determining the value of the decedent's lifetime giving. This difficulty arises on two fronts:
<ul><p><li>
<b>First,</b> a gift is the transfer of property for something less than full legal consideration to a party generally within the donor's family. On the one hand, the executor must determine which gift transfers meet the test of insufficient legal consideration. On the other hand, the executor must distinguish gifts made for income tax purposes that require "detached and disinterested generosity" from those that qualify for the gift tax.<sup>29</sup><p><li><b>Second,</b> the executor or the court must wrestle with the question of "fair market value."  The federal gift tax requires that <i>all</i> wealth transfers made as gifts over the decedent's entire life be valued for taxation. That means, incredibly, that appraisals of value must be made for gifts made decades before the decedent's death. Moreover, these gifts must be appraised in terms of their "fair market value" at the time they were made, which is a task that often stretches the frontiers of property appraisal to its breaking point.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such extraordinary efforts at valuation and record reconstruction must be made in order to determine whether the annual level of gift giving exceeded the allowed limits. An estate may exclude from the gift tax base all annual present interest gift transfers of $10,000 or less per donee.<sup>30</sup>  But if the donor made the gift to meet the donee's tuition or medical expenses, the limit does not apply. Furthermore, if the donor's spouse elects to make a similar gift to the same donee (a practice known as gift-splitting), the annual limit rises to $20,000. All gifts above these limits become part of the gift tax base.

	<p><li><b>Deductions.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 

Like the estate tax base, the gift tax base can be reduced by certain deductions. Besides gift-splitting, certain gifts to one's spouse may be deducted. Also, gifts to charities recognized by the IRS as tax-exempt organizations can be deducted from the gift tax base.<sup>31</sup>  Finally, special rules apply to the division of property in a divorce or separation, and this leads to more gift tax deductions.<sup>32</sup>	<p><li><b>Tax Liability.</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Computing the amount of gift tax is relatively simple. First, taxable gifts for the current and all previous calendar years are summed and taxed using the tax rate table for estates. Second, this total amount of gift tax then is reduced by any unused unified transfer tax credit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To illustrate, suppose that a married couple gave their only child $10,000 a year for a period of 20 years, for a cumulative total of $200,000. These gifts equal the maximum annual amount that taxpayers may exclude from the federal gift tax base. However, for four years this couple made additional gifts to their child of $100,000 a year, for a total of $400,000. This latter amount is above the limit and is taxable. Now suppose that the gross taxable estate of this couple equals $1,000,000, which includes the taxable gifts. The executor of the estate will use the unified credit of $600,000 to reduce the taxable amount and will pay taxes on the remaining $400,000, or the additional gifts the couple gave their child.
</ol><p>

<b>The Generation-Skipping Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Wealth transfer taxes have been so consistently high throughout this century that a substantial cottage industry devoted to estate tax avoidance has blossomed within the legal and financial communities. One of their cleverest inventions was a trust established by a parent for the lifetime benefit of his or her children that passed tax-free to the parent's grandchildren upon the parent's death (or bypassed the children completely and went directly to the grandchildren). The trust avoided estate taxes altogether because such taxes are never levied on amounts that cannot be controlled by the taxpayer. However, some trusts were designed to pay out to the grandchildren upon the death of the taxpayer's children. Thus, the taxpayer could target specific individuals to receive benefits from the estate if the taxpayer could skip a generation through the creative use of a tax-free trust.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress enacted a cumbersome tax law change in 1976 to close the indirect generation-skipping transfer, but it left unaddressed the trust or bequest that directly skipped the parent's children. Both of these loopholes were addressed by Congress in 1986. As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress established a flat-rate tax of 55 percent on all generation-skipping transfers. Transfers subject to the tax are those made from a trust to a "skip person" (someone two or more generations removed from the donor); those made by a donor directly to a "skip person" without going through a trust; and those that result from termination of an interest in a property or trust, which usually happens upon the death of the donor.<sup>33</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As with the estate tax and the gift tax, several exclusions and exemptions apply. The same $10,000 annual exclusion and tuition and medical exemptions found in the gift tax law apply to generation-skipping taxes. A total lifetime exclusion of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 for married couples) is allowed. Finally, transfers made prior to January 1, 1990, are exempt up to $2,000,000 ($4,000,000 for married couples).<sup>34</sup><p><b>THE LIBERAL CASE FOR REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This complex tax edifice rests on the foundation that taxing intergenerational wealth transfers results in less concentrated wealth holdings and that this leads in turn to greater economic opportunity and a more democratic society. Certainly simplicity cannot be raised in support of this tax policy, as the above discussion indicates. And, as Figures 1 and 2 show, the estate and gift tax cannot be justified as playing an important role in financing government: The unified estate and gift tax now brings in less than 1.7 percent of total federal revenues.
<p>

<b>The Liberal Egalitarian Argument for Intergenerational Wealth Taxation</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The case for the estate tax turns on the tax's effectiveness in achieving greater economic democracy through the redistribution of wealth. If its supporters cannot sustain the argument that the estate tax improves equality of economic opportunity, then there exists little else (except perhaps inertia) to recommend continuation of this part of U.S. tax policy. Other, simpler taxes could meet revenue objectives far more efficiently.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Academic support for intergenerational wealth taxation remains warm, in large part because of the role it plays in the most important theoretical treatise on liberal egalitarianism, John Rawls's <i>A Theory of Justice.</i><sup>35</sup>  Since its publication in 1971, this careful, magisterial presentation of the case for liberal democracy infused with just institutions has permeated thinking on most issues in social and political theory. It is fair to say that no stronger theoretical case for intergenerational wealth taxation exists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the center of Rawls's case for wealth taxation is the principle that "[a]ll social primary goods -- liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases of self-respect -- are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any or all of these goods is to the advantage of the least favored."<sup>36</sup>  While at first blush this principle would appear to suggest radical egalitarianism in economic and political life, Rawls recognizes the superiority of "free" over socialized markets to produce benefits for the least advantaged citizens, which leads him and many like-minded political theorists to support significant differences in the economic conditions of individuals within a generation. After a century of economic experimentation, there can be little doubt that everyone achieves greater economic benefit when individuals are allowed to discover their own comparative advantage and focus their labor in the area where they can make the greatest economic difference.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tolerance for intragenerational differences leads Rawls to oppose all income taxes, since economic income stems from natural differences in talent and from differing propensities of individuals to apply themselves to hard work.<sup>37</sup>  However, two principled considerations compel Rawls to take substantial exception to intergenerational differences in economic condition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>First,</b> Rawls opposes the transfer of accumulated property to succeeding generations because it undermines the first principle of a just society: that everyone has "an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all."<sup>38</sup>  Those who begin with a significant unearned endowment of property resources place others not so advantaged in a less equal condition, and this undermines the principle that everyone should have access to the same system of equal basic liberties.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>Second,</b> this difference might be tolerated if it produced greater benefits for the least advantaged than for the advantaged. However, intergenerational wealth transfers create benefits that flow in the opposite direction: Over time, they enhance the advantages of inheriting generations and generally degrade the liberties of the unbenefitted. Thus, "[t]he taxation of inheritance and income at progressive rates (when necessary), and the legal definition of property rights, are to secure the institutions of equal liberty in a property-owning democracy and the fair value of the rights they establish."<sup>39</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While Rawls does not advance confiscatory taxation of intergenerational wealth transfers, his argument does imply substantial taxing discretion by the state. In his universe, the state guides the institutions of distribution; should government determine that wealth transfers constitute significant barriers to the equal enjoyment of liberties (as defined by Rawls), it clearly has the power to tax away as much of the wealth that moves between generations as it deems necessary to restore justice.

<p>
<b>Objections to the Liberal Egalitarian Case for the Estate Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A number of objections could be raised against the Rawlsian case for wealth transfer taxation, not the least of them being the questionable assertion of government authority over the intergenerational disposition of private property. If wealth is acquired legally and transferred peacefully (that is, in some non-tortious fashion that breaches no contract pertaining to the property), government has no ethical standing to interfere with its disposition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, liberal egalitarians claim a more expansive role for government, a principal element of which is the progressive enhancement of equality of condition among citizens. Thus, it is important first to consider the estate tax within the context of the argument that justifies the tax's existence. If it can be shown that the estate tax does not advance the ethical program of the liberal egalitarians, then other objections to this tax that can be raised without assuming this ethical and moral framework become more compelling.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This approach to analyzing the estate tax was taken in a seminal monograph by Edward J. McCaffery published in <i>The Yale Law Journal</i> in 1994.<sup>40</sup>  Professor McCaffery comes to the debate over the estate tax with impeccable political credentials. Unlike many critics of intergenerational taxation who frame their objections within a larger, politically conservative analysis of contemporary government, MaCaffery formulated his critique of the estate tax within a liberal framework. As he stated last year before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance:<blockquote>	I am an unrequited liberal, in both the classical and contemporary political senses of that word, whose views on social and distributive justice might best be described as progressive. I used to believe in the gift and estate tax as a vehicle for obtaining justice. As to the latter belief, only, I am now prepared to confess that I "was blind, but now can see."<sup>41</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;McCaffery raises five general objections to the liberal egalitarian argument supporting intergenerational wealth taxation. Each of them assumes the ethical and moral objectives of the liberal political program.
<ol>
<p><li><b>The currently combined income and estate tax system encourages large <i>inter vivos</i> gift transfers, which have the effect of creating a greater inequality of starting points or a less level economic playing field.</b> This predictable effect of the estate tax law is aggravated further by the fact that high estate tax rates encourage the consumption rather than the transfer of wealth. Purchasing goods and services instead of saving the funds that support that consumption produces larger differences between rich and poor people. Thus, the estate tax is illiberal because it undermines rather than advances the liberal egalitarian objective of equality of economic opportunity.

<p><li><b>While higher wealth transfer taxes might reduce the level of <i>inter vivos</i> gifts, and other tax law changes could be made to penalize the spending behavior of rich families, it currently is both practically and politically impossible to do so.</b> On the one hand, analysts are becoming increasingly aware of the intergenerational focus of much current saving behavior at all income levels. Liberals should promote the creation of transferable wealth among the less advantaged. On the other hand, politicians are becoming increasingly aware of how much voters want taxes to fall, not rise. The estate or inheritance tax has been repealed in Australia, Canada, Israel, and California; and the movement for tax reform is a spreading, worldwide movement.
<p>
<p><li><b>There will always be differences between the starting conditions of people in a non-ideal world.</b> If liberal egalitarians attempted to eliminate all the differences that stem from intergenerational wealth transfers, they would risk leaving the least advantaged even worse off than they were before. Not only would confiscatory taxation reduce the consumption behavior of wealthy people, thereby also reducing employment and incomes among poorer citizens, but it would depress the amount of economic capital as well, thereby reducing economic expansion and income growth, both of which are central to improving the conditions of the least advantaged.
<p>
<p><li><b>"[It] is the use and not the mere concentration of wealth that threatens reasonable liberal values."</b><sup>42</sup>  Generally speaking, the accumulation of savings and the promotion of earnings that underlie the growth of savings are "goods" that liberals like. Earnings and savings create a "common pool" of resources that can be used to promote improvements in the general welfare through public and private means. Liberals generally regard the consumption behavior of the wealthy as objectionable; thus, wealth transfer taxation, which attacks savings and promotes wanton consumption, is wholly ill-suited to the attainment of an ideal liberal society.

<p><li><b>The best tax policy that liberal egalitarians could pursue, if attaining liberal social and political objectives truly motivates the liberal program, is one that taxes consumption, not savings.</b> McCaffery writes that:<blockquote>

	[b]y getting our reasonable political judgments wrong -- by taxing work and savings while condoning, even encouraging large-scale use [consumption] -- the status quo impedes the liberal project....  The real threats to liberty and equality from private possession alone turn out, on closer scrutiny, to relate to possession <i>qua</i> potential or actual use, each of which can be addressed -- indeed, can <i>best</i> be addressed -- in a tax system without an estate tax.<sup>43</sup>
</ol><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not only, then, is the estate tax inconsistent with a liberal program of promoting equality of economic condition, but it encourages behavior that works against liberal objectives. It supports consumption and depletion by penalizing savings and earnings. It encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like Steve Forbes to spend $30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save $30 million for his children's future -- an investment upon which he will pay a 55 percent transfer tax as opposed to a campaign expenditure upon which no additional taxes are ever levied. How many new jobs and new businesses did Mr. Forbes's campaign create as opposed to the same amount saved in a bank that lends the funds to entrepreneurs and business managers?  Liberals and conservatives are beginning to answer this question in precisely the same way.
</ol>
<b>Few Friends.</b> The weaknesses of the estate and income tax system as a tool for redistribution long have been known, even to its academic friends. Joseph Stiglitz, who now serves as the Chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, concluded in 1978 that the estate tax effectively transfers resources from the saver to the spender, which, absent any offsetting tax policy change, reduces the stock of capital and leads to lower levels of national wealth.<sup>44</sup>  Furthermore, wrote Stiglitz,
<blockquote>
	because of capital accumulation effects, the estate tax may not achieve the objective to which it is presumably directed, that is, equalizing the distribution of income; if the government takes actions to offset these accumulation effects, the tax will lead to an increase in equality of income and wealth. The desirability of the estate tax may still be questioned, not only because of the distortions which it introduces but also because it may actually increase inequality in the distribution of consumption.<sup>45</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Alan Blinder, another member of the President's initial Council of Economic Advisers and subsequently Vice-Chairman of the Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors, also has raised serious doubts about the redistributional promises of the estate tax.<sup>46</sup>  He has been joined by Michael Boskin, Martin Feldstein, Gary Becker, Laurence Kotlikoff, Lawrence Summers, and many other economists with prominent connections to mainstream economics.<sup>47</sup>


<p><b>THE ECONOMIC CASE AGAINST THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to the Left's declining enthusiasm for the ideology of wealth taxes, two economic issues have added to the momentum for repeal. One is the mounting weight of economic and financial evidence against the estate and gift tax as such. The other is the rapidly spreading general view that income taxes and the multiple taxation of savings reduce economic growth, which in turn slows the rate of economic improvement by the least advantaged. Among the economic problems associated with the tax:
<ul>
<p><li><b>The estate tax raises little money and encourages inefficient tax-avoidance schemes.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Bolstering the skepticism about the efficiency of the estate and gift tax is the striking fact of how little revenue it raises for the federal government. Despite the tax's broad reach, theoretically touching upon nearly all transferable wealth, the unified tax raised only $14.7 billion in 1995.<sup>48</sup>  As Figure 1 shows, the estate and gift tax consistently has fallen as a percentage of total federal revenues, while at the same time the total amount of wealth has risen dramatically.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When a tax raises significantly less than the estimate of its potential, it is often because taxpayers have discovered ways to avoid the tax and have changed their economic behavior in ways that reduce the pool of funds from which the tax is drawn. To understand the extent to which this happens, it is necessary to estimate just what estate tax collections theoretically should look like.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Public finance economists have struggled for a long time with this question. Producing an adequate answer, however, requires knowing a great deal more than we now do about the size of legal tax avoidance and the degree to which taxpayers change their economic behavior in order to reduce their estate tax liabilities. Moreover, economists do not know the size of the wealth pool within which estates are formed. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis periodically estimates household net worth, or the sum of durables, savings, and equities held by households.<sup>49</sup>  The Bureau currently estimates this net worth to be about $26.4 trillion, of which $8.4 trillion is in equities. While this amount by no means constitutes the tax base for the estate tax, a portion of this enormous sum most certainly does. For example, Laurence J. Kotlikoff estimates that slightly more than 50 percent of household wealth is held as intergenerational savings.<sup>50</sup>  If one assumes that this 50 percent (or $13.2 trillion) is transferred in equal amounts over two generations, or 46 years, then about $290 billion annually is moving to the next generation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even this figure probably overstates the tax base for the estate tax. Many economists argue that taxpayers who believe they will pay estate taxes will change their economic behavior in ways that result in a huge shrinkage of the estate tax base.<sup>51</sup>  B. Douglas Bernheim argues that high estate tax rates lead taxpayers to make far more cash gifts to their children than they otherwise would, in large part because their children pay taxes at lower rates than they do. Bernheim estimates that 50 percent to 75 percent of all intergenerational gifts are made because of the estate tax. Charitable gifts and other revenue losses are between 70 percent and 80 percent of total estate tax revenue. Put another way, indirect revenue losses in 1995 might have been $11 billion on revenues of $14.7 billion.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The revenue data strongly imply significant tax avoidance and other economic behavior that responds to high tax rates by moving national wealth (and thus taxable estates) from savings to consumption. It is exceptionally difficult, however, for analysts to go from implication to quantification. Recent breakthroughs in the economic understanding of household savings may lead ultimately to convincing estimates of how much savings behavior stems from income and estate tax policy. Even so, economists can offer a number of important insights about the deleterious economic effects of tax policy on economic performance.
<p>
<li><b>The estate tax discourages savings.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Savings take many different forms -- cash reserves in a bank, stock in a corporation, art, land, housing, ownership of a business, and so forth -- that serve many different purposes. Households hold cash in a bank largely to finance future consumption, like the purchase of a house, or as a hedge against unanticipated household expenses like costly medical care. Similarly, the equity component of a mortgage is designed to be used to purchase future housing. These two forms of savings are largely liquid and thus earn relatively low rates of return. Households put money in a bank with the understanding that their funds can be withdrawn virtually at any time the household prefers. The bank, in turn, lends these savings with this same understanding in mind, and therefore prefers relatively short-term, low-risk loans that contain significant liquidity for the bank. So if a household saves in a long-term time deposit (for example, a 10-year certificate of deposit), it will demand a higher rate of return as compensation for not having these funds available for consumption. The bank, in turn, is freer to invest in riskier ventures for which it also can demand a higher rate of return. The bank's cost of a loan failure also falls when it is working with longer-term savings: It knows it has a certain period of time to make successful loans that cover its contract with the saver and yield the bank a profit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The decision to save largely follows this simple story. When households consume most of their income, any long-term investment must earn a high return. However, when they increase their savings relative to their consumption of income, they require less compensation for foregone consumption, and the required rate of return falls. Economists are divided between those who believe that households have a relatively fixed savings percentage over their lifetimes (which implies relatively fixed time preferences) and those who see the percentage of savings as something that fluctuates as certain preferences (including time or consumption) and costs (particularly taxes) change. It is this latter viewpoint that is particularly relevant to estate tax analysis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taxes play a role in savings decisions because they increase the cost of saving relative to consuming income. For example, if a household invests 25 percent of its income after taxes in a bank account that earns interest, it will pay additional taxes on any interest it takes as income. If another household decides to invest its 25 percent in corporate stocks, it will pay additional taxes on any capital gains it takes as income. However, if both households take that same 25 percent of after-tax income and buy expensive shoes, no additional income taxes will be collected. No doubt sales taxes will be collected on the shoe purchases, but sales tax rates are almost always less than the income tax rate one would pay on the same amount of money. Thus, taxes discourage saving by increasing its cost relative to consumption. If the household saves anyway, it will demand a higher rate of return to compensate it for the taxes it must pay on interest earnings. Likewise, a household purchasing stocks will demand a higher and more secure rate of return on its stocks. In both cases, the cost of capital to the borrower -- to the bank or to the corporation -- has risen because of taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One way for a household to save and avoid additional taxation is to purchase an asset like art or land that appreciates slowly over a very long period of time. This kind of purchase, however, also increases the economy-wide cost of capital by reducing the fund of money available to banks and businesses. Still another way to reduce the tax cost of saving is to invest in tax-advantaged funds, such as IRAs or 403(b) and 401(k) plans. These types of funds annuitize savings, which means essentially that only low-risk, long-term, low-yield to medium-yield investments will be supported by them. While they do reduce current tax liabilities, they are especially costly for the saver in two ways: In addition to shrouding these plans in penalties and taxes should they be liquidated before the saver reaches a certain age, the government has significantly discounted the future value of these savings by delaying taxes on earnings until they are at their highest level.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The unified estate and gift tax adds yet another layer of taxes on any savings decision a household makes. Successful saving always raises the possibility of creating a taxable estate, at which point the tax cost of a dollar saved increases by an amount somewhere between 7.4 cents and 55 cents. So if the household persists in its decision to save, it will require some long-term premium return on its investments roughly equal to its estimate that estate taxes will not be avoided. Naturally, this premium further increases the cost of capital.

<p><li><b>The estate tax hurts small business.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Investing in a business is one of the many forms of saving -- for some families, the only form. For most small firms, every available dollar goes into the family business -- the dry-cleaning business, the restaurant, the trucking company -- because the business creates an asset for the children and incomes for the owners. Women re-entering the work force after raising children often find self-employment the only entry-level employment open to them. Minorities know the reasons for self-employment only too well.
</ul><p><b>
Minorities Hit Hard.</b> All of the financial security provided by these businesses is put at risk if the owner dies with a taxable estate. In an important 1995 study of how minority businesses perceive the estate tax,<sup>53</sup> Joseph Astrachan and Craig Aronoff found that:
<ul>
<p><li>Some 90 percent of the surveyed minority businesses knew that they might be subject to the federal estate tax;

<p><li>About 67 percent of these businesses had taken steps (including gifts of stock, ownership restructuring, life insurance purchases, and buy/sell agreements) to shelter their assets from taxation;

<p><li>Over 50 percent of these same businesses indicated that they would not have taken these steps had there been no estate tax; and

<p><li>Some 58 percent of all the businesses in the survey anticipated failure or great difficulty surviving after determining their estate taxes.<sup>54</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Astrachan/Aronoff study echoes findings in a 1994 study by Patrick Fleenor and J. D. Foster of the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based tax policy organization,<sup>55</sup> who presented estimates of lifetime effective tax rates for a taxable corporation, a non-corporate business, an individual earning high amounts of labor income, and a large business. In each case, Fleenor and Foster found that the presence of the estate tax raised the lifetime tax rate to a figure above 65 percent. The large business simulation determined a tax rate of 72 percent. Nearly every public finance economist of the last 50 years has concluded that tax rates of this magnitude significantly reduce the taxpayer's willingness to earn more and take entrepreneurial risk. And these two effects -- reductions in labor and in new business formation -- directly depress the rate of general economic growth, which should deeply concern everyone interested in improving economic welfare in the United States.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While Professor McCaffery appears unaware of the Fleenor/Foster study, it includes precisely the kind of evidence he has marshaled to assail the estate tax as inimical to the expansion of economic opportunity. He is not, however, unaware of Richard E. Wagner's important 1993 monograph, <i>Federal Transfer Taxation: A Study in Social Cost,</i> which ties together the many threads of this emerging theoretical canon on estate taxation.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Professor Wagner's study stands virtually alone in presenting macroeconomic estimates of the estate tax's effects on individual decisions to work and save. Using a model that trades labor for capital according to their relative costs and that represents this dynamic interaction through key indicators of macroeconomic activity, Wagner found that the tax premiums created by the estate tax raise the cost of capital sufficiently to reduce national output, employment, and capital stock by measurable amounts. In a simulation that modeled the U.S. economy without the current estate tax, Wagner found that:
<ul>
<p><li>Nominal gross domestic product (GDP) would have been $80 billion higher after eight years than in an economy without the estate tax;

<p><li>228,000 more jobs would have been created;

<p><li>The capital stock would have been $640 billion larger;<sup>57</sup> and

<p><li>The larger economy resulting from the repeal of estate taxes produced increases in all other taxes over the eight-year simulation period, though not quite by an amount equal to the loss of the estate tax.<sup>58</sup>
</ul><p>

<b>THE IMPACT OF REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While analysts have made significant progress in understanding the microeconomic effects of intergenerational taxation, the dearth of studies similar to Wagner's shows that much work still needs to be done on measuring the tax's macroeconomic effects. It is little wonder, however, that such studies are not more numerous. As Stiglitz noted, there are many remaining questions about the tax's effects on wealth accumulation. And without a good knowledge of these effects, economists cannot create that most elementary but crucial of concepts in any tax analysis: the tax base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bearing in mind these limitations, the author and Heritage Foundation analysts have estimated the economic impact of repealing the estate and gift tax beginning in 1997. The Heritage analysis made certain assumptions about the effect of repeal. Each of these assumptions was introduced into two leading models of the U.S. economy: the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM) and the Mark 11 macroeconomic model of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates.<sup>59</sup>  These two statistical models of U.S. economic activity are highly regarded, exceptionally accurate tools for estimating the effects of public policy changes on the general economy and are widely used for this purpose by America's leading corporations and government agencies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given the substantial doubt that annual estate tax filings fully reflect the size of the tax base,<sup>60</sup> estimates of the tax's economic effects must start from another foundation. The macroeconomic estimates presented here were built from estimates of changes in the U.S. labor force and domestic capital stocks associated with removing the estate tax portion of the after-tax cost of labor and capital. These estimates then were introduced into the macroeconomic models to compute the effects.

<p>
<b>Cost of Capital Assumptions</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The cost of capital (the so-called rental price of investment) results from at least three factors: 1) the cost of attracting investors to supply capital funds and not do something else with their money, 2) the ratio of a capital good's depreciation relative to the value of output it produces, and 3) taxes. If a business or a household borrows money, it must pay the lender or investor enough to attract that lender or investor away from other opportunities. A portion of this "opportunity cost" payment is the tax that the lender expects to owe on the loan's earnings. Under current law, a business may offset some of this tax premium by deducting its annual depreciation and interest payments. In some cases, businesses also may claim various investment tax credits that further reduce the tax premiums they have had to pay to lenders. However, a substantial portion of the cost of operating a business is not tax deductible, and this results in a positive, residual tax premium in real-world capital costs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, taxes on ordinary income constitute a substantial percentage of the tax premium in the cost of capital. Every investor attempts to earn the highest possible return on every investment so that his earnings cover the income taxes the investment incurs. The estate tax, however, also is a part of this premium. Just as households are the source of all investment funds, they also are the source of all estate taxes. When individuals begin to see that their income and investment efforts will produce a future taxable estate, they generally do two things: see a financial advisor or estate planner, and increase their earnings requirements to build the funds needed to pay the wealth transfer taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Using data associating incomes with tax liabilities and holdings of corporate paper and equities, Heritage analysts estimated that the present value of future estate tax liabilities for the class of households that holds most corporate debt is slightly more than 3 percent of the average yield on corporate bonds. Thus, if corporate bonds currently yield 10 percent, eliminating wealth transfer taxes would reduce the required yield to 9.7 percent. This estimate of the estate tax component of the tax premium was used to adjust projected corporate bond yields over the period 1997 through 2005.

<p>
<b>Labor Effect Assumptions</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economists also argue that high taxes reduce the supply of labor. At a certain point, when faced with rising taxes, workers decide to consume more leisure and produce less labor. Wealth transfer taxes are widely assumed to produce this effect, particularly among a class of individuals who clearly perceive the adverse tax consequences of working harder and building greater taxable net worth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To capture this effect of estate taxes and introduce it into the U.S. macroeconomic model, Heritage analysts estimated the number of wage or salaried workers and self-employed individuals in this same class of households that hold most of America's corporate debt. Eliminating the estate tax would be equivalent to increasing after-tax lifetime earnings by the average effective estate tax rate, or by 18 percent. This percentage, of course, is the minimum amount of earnings change that estate tax repeal would cause: A significant but unknown amount of time and income now is devoted to positioning assets and paying accountants in order to avoid significant estate tax liabilities. This estimate also fails to capture the substantial costs borne by taxpayers and relatives when businesses fail because of estate tax liabilities. In any event, multiplying a standard labor supply elasticity of 0.3 percent by this percentage reduction in taxes, and then multiplying this product times the 18 million individuals in this class of households, yields a labor supply effect of 97,200. This number was used to adjust upwards all estimates of the civilian labor force for the period 1997 through 2005.
<p>
<b>Budget Assumptions</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Besides introducing new labor force and capital cost settings into the macroeconomic model, Heritage also made two adjustments in the federal government's budget for the period 1997 through 2005. First, the total amount of federal revenues was reduced by the forecasted amount of the estate tax. Second, expenditures for non-defense purchases were reduced by an amount exactly equal to the "lost" estate tax revenue. Thus, repealing the estate tax is assumed to be offset by spending reductions, so there is no net contribution to the deficit because of lost estate tax revenue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is highly likely that eliminating the estate tax would result in slightly greater federal income tax receipts. Without an estate tax, taxpayers would make fewer gift transfers to their children, who commonly pay income taxes at rates lower than their parents. However, estimating the size of this effect on income tax revenues involves overcoming a host of problems raised by incomplete estate tax data. The IRS simply is unwilling to disclose important details on intergenerational giving. Thus, the following analysis does not contain estimates of the positive effects of estate tax repeal on income tax receipts. If we had made these estimates, the macroeconomic effects of repeal would have been even more positive.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By adapting the macroeconomic models in the manner described above, the resulting estate tax simulation measures the economic effects of repealing this tax on December 31, 1996. That is, it shows how differently the economy would have behaved had taxpayers not faced the prospect of estate taxes beginning in 1997. This simulated economy is compared to a "baseline" economy in which the current estate tax is still present. The differences between the baseline and simulated economies are the dynamic impacts of estate tax repeal. Again, these estimates should be viewed as a minimum assessment of the tax's economic effects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Table 2 indicates that a stronger economy would result from the repeal of wealth transfer taxes.
<ul><p><li>
The most general measurement of economic health (GDP adjusted for inflation) quickly jumps above baseline by as much as 0.4 percent in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM. The increase in real GDP averages $11.2 billion per year over the nine-year period between 1997 and 2005. Figure 3 shows the effects on GDP caused by estate tax repeal. When the Heritage assumptions are fed into the WEFA model, the economy grows above baseline by an average of $2.83 billion over this period.<sup>61</sup>
<p><li>
Behind the growth in GDP is a strong increase in investment. A drop in the cost of capital caused by estate tax repeal leads to increased business purchases of buildings and machines. Investment in the goods that make labor more productive grows 2 percent faster between 1997 and 2005 than it otherwise would. Using the WEFA model, investment grows 0.9 percent faster over this same time period. Economists widely believe that growth in capital goods is closely related to economic growth, and that this helps explain the higher growth in GDP.
<p><li>
In addition to stimulating the growth of private investment, repealing the estate tax reduces the tax costs that workers face. Lower taxes on income are widely believed to result in a larger labor force. The Heritage estate tax simulation results in a significant growth in non-farm private employment, whichever model is used. Total non-farm employment grows by an average of 145,000 above baseline during the nine-year period using the WUMM. This growth subsides in subsequent years as wages rise to reflect the greater productivity of labor caused by the greater amount of capital per laborer. By 2003, total non-farm employment has returned to its long-term growth trend. The Heritage analysis using the WEFA model estimates average employment growth to be 86,000 over this period.
<p><li>
Not only do businesses take advantage of lower capital costs to buy new plant and equipment, but families increase their purchases of new homes. Housing starts jump sharply during the first two years after repeal. The Heritage simulation using the WUMM model predicts that estate tax repeal would lead to a first-year increase of 49,000 in housing starts. This effect is caused by a significant drop in the mortgage interest rate. The fact that it does not drop more in subsequent years explains why housing starts return to baseline after the third year following repeal.
<p><li>
The boost in housing and the growth in business investment expenditures reflect the lower capital costs that result from removing the estate tax premium on capital. The cost of corporate capital and the secondary mortgage rate fall by an average of 21 and 27 basis points, respectively, in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM. While this decline is less dramatic in the WEFA model, the user cost of capital remains solidly below baseline throughout the nine-year period. As economic activity builds following repeal of the estate tax, demand for capital rises, leading to small increases in both the long bond rate and the federal funds rate. Subtle elevations in these market lending rates would be the expected result in an economy that is adding more jobs and creating more capital goods than an economy still burdened by high tax rates.
<p><li>
The growth in household income also supports the increase in housing starts. Between 1997 and 2005, inflation-adjusted household disposable income (broadly, what is left after taxes) grows by an average of $12 billion per year in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM model. Similar growth also occurs in total personal income, which increases by an average of $8 billion per year. Both of these income indicators rise because of higher levels of employment, greater worker productivity, and stronger household and business consumption. The WEFA model shows inflation-adjusted disposable income rising by an average of $9 billion per year and personal income growing by an average of $5 billion per year over this nine-year period.
<p><li>
Despite the loss of $15 billion in annual revenue and $15 billion less in government spending, the federal deficit does not worsen over this nine-year period. In fact, the WUMM simulation shows that a stronger economy leads to deficit improvement. For each of the first seven years in the estate tax simulation, the deficit is slightly less after estate tax repeal than in an economy with an estate tax. During the last two years of the simulation, higher interest rates cause a gentle rise in federal expenditures. Te WEFA simulation indicates minor deficit changes throughout the nine-year period. Both simulations, however, point to the same conclusion: The economic benefits from estate tax repeal should not be sacrificed because of concerns about a federal deficit.
</ul><p><b>
CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is easy in this season of big tax reform proposals to overlook the federal estate tax. This tax, after all, is a relatively minor source of federal revenue that has been declining for the past 20 years. Indeed, many of those involved in the ongoing tax policy debate simply ignore it.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is a mistake. As this study has shown, the economic cost of the estate tax is many times greater than the revenue it produces, and its reach into American households extends far beyond those few which pay it. Every day, social and economic decisions are made with the estate tax in mind. Minority businesspeople suffer anxious moments wondering whether the savings they have built in their businesses, and that they plan to hand to their children, will be destroyed by the estate tax bill. Poor people, for whom the estate tax has no immediacy, wonder at the scarcity of entry-level jobs or the absence of low-cost educational loans. Factories drone on with worn-out equipment that would be replaced if capital costs fell. Women who have raised their children struggle to find ways to re-enter the work force without upsetting the family's estate tax avoidance plan. Rich people buy vacations in Vail and fine art in Lisbon, rather than new businesses that create jobs and incomes, because the government has a claim on more than half of everything they cannot spend.

The estate and gift tax does much to perpetuate the social and economic distortions produced generally by taxes on income. Should Congress repeal this tax, however, the result would be a growing economy, more abundant jobs, and offices and factories with the kind of new equipment that elevates productivity and supports higher wages. Lower capital costs also would mean new small businesses, which traditionally have served as economic havens for minority families and launching pads for young workers. By repealing the estate and gift tax, Congress would be making significant progress toward creating a tax policy that complements rather than undermines other efforts to expand economic opportunity by creating a growing economy.

    There is little foundation for a claim that the U.S. government levied taxes on incomes in 1914 because it needed additional revenues. Federal budget surpluses in 1911 and 1912 led to a reduction in total federal debt in 1913 and 1914, and these latter two years had very small deficits of about $400,000 each.

    Congress exempted the first $50,000 and taxed the remainder of the estate at rates that ranged from 1 percent to 10 percent on values above $5,000,000. Luckey, "A History of Federal Estate, Gift, and Generation-Skipping Taxes," p. 7.

    However, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DFRA) extended until 1988 a 55 percent top tax rate that had been scheduled to fall to 50 percent in 1985. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 introduced a tougher penalty on generation-skipping wealth transfers by taxing all such transfers at the top marginal rate of 55 percent. And the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 further forestalled the fall in the top tax rate until the end of 1992.

    This section of the paper relies heavily on John R. Luckey's comprehensive summary of federal wealth taxation. See John R. Luckey, "Federal Estate, Gift, and Generation-Skipping Taxes: A Description of Current Law," <i>CRS Report for Congress,</i> Congressional Research Service, March 16, 1995.
<p><li>
    "Fair market value" apparently means the value of an asset that a fully informed buyer would pay in a market for the asset. The concept implies the existence of a willing seller and able buyer, which is rarely the case when an estate is valued for tax purposes. Thus, executors must rely on various proxy prices for an estate's assets, such as recent closing prices for stocks and bonds and property sales of similar assets that are contemporary with the death of the decedent. The value of "good will" is a particularly vexing problem in estate tax valuation. Due to the numerous artifices that executors and courts must employ to place a value on estates, the resulting "gross estate" frequently bears little relationship to its market value. For example, an estate consisting solely of art that has been held for many years may have little market value if the tastes of the art-buying public have changed dramatically during the holding period.
<p><li>
    While "fair market value" at the time of death is the most common method of quantifying a decedent's death, an executor of an estate paying tax can elect an alternative valuation date that is somewhat earlier or six months after the date of death. This alternative date method applies particularly to estates dominated by bonds or stocks in companies whose value is significantly affected by the death of the decedent. See 26 U.S.C. Secs. 2031(a) and 2032(a).

    This Study was prepared by The Heritage Foundation using tax simulation models developed by The Heritage Foundation and the Washington University Macro Model and the Mark 11 U.S. Macro Model of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates. The methodologies, assumptions, conclusions, and opinions herein are entirely those of The Heritage Foundation. They have not been endorsed by, and do not necessarily reflect the views of, the owners of these two macroeconomic models.
<p><li>
    From an economic standpoint, a tax's base is composed of some quantifiable behavior that is being affected by the tax. The estate tax base could be viewed as the sum of all those dollars that are managed annually so as to avoid paying the tax, plus those that end up on a tax form.
<p><li>
     Even though these two estimates of additional GDP are different, the two models indicate the same general result: The economy grows more without the estate tax. The outputs of econometric models often differ, even when employing the very same assumptions, because of subtle differences in the theoretical viewpoints upon which the models are constructed. After all, such models are intended to give analysts insight into how changes in specific economic relationships affect the macroeconomy. The differences between the two models used in this study stem largely from WUMM's greater emphasis on the rental price of investment as a driver of economic activity.

<title>What the Gas Tax Costs State Economies - Heritage</title>

<center><h3>WHAT THE GAS TAX COSTS STATE ECONOMIES</h3>

<P>
<a href="fyi100.gif">Table 1</a>: Estimated Revenue Raised by 4.3 Cent per Gallon Federal Gas Tax, 1996
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is now considering repealing the 4.3 cent federal tax imposed under the 1993 budget plan championed by the Clinton Administration.  Gasoline prices at service stations across the country have risen sharply over the last few months, raising concerns over the impact of these rising prices on already strained family budgets.  Nationally, since the beginning of the year, gas prices have risen approximately 16 cents.  In California, where prices have risen even more dramatically, gasoline now costs more than $2 a gallon in some areas.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While recent gas price hikes are an unwelcome added cost to family budgets, they actually are far exceeded by the total gas taxes paid by Americans.  Combined federal and state gas taxes per gallon of gasoline now average 37.7 cents, more than twice the recent short-term spike caused by market conditions.  These taxes raise the cost of driving a car an average of $310 per year.  In response to the growing public concern over prices and the economic impact of the tax burden, Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX) introduced a <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1727:">bill</a> on May 2 which would repeal the 1993 federal fuel tax of 4.3 cents applying to gasoline and diesel.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) also is expected soon to offer a bill that will repeal the gas and diesel tax and possibly may roll back the 4.3 cent tax on jet fuel as well.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Eliminating the 1993 gas tax is a good start.  While gasoline would still be subject to a 14 cent federal tax, as well as substantial state taxes, repealing the 4.3 cent tax would benefit the economy by reducing transportation costs.  It also would help family budgets.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unlike the rest of the federal gasoline tax, the 4.3 cent levy is not earmarked for transportation costs.  It flows instead into general revenues.  As Senator Dole has said, at least the previous gasoline taxes "helped build highways and bridges, but this tax was just for deficit reduction.  It doesn't do a thing for highways or bridges.... If we repeal this tax, it'll be 4 cents cheaper at the pump.  If we can find an offset, then we should repeal this tax."  Melvin Sherbert, Chairman of the Legislative Committee of the National Service Station Dealers and owner of two service stations himself, confirmed that tax savings would be passed on directly to consumers.  Sherbert testified on May 3 before theSenate Finance Committee that "We would pass the savings on because we are just waiting to lower prices [because] that helps us sell more gas while still making the same profit [per gallon]."<sup>1</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The poor and lower middle class would be the biggest beneficiaries of this repeal.  Susan Perry, Senior Vice President of the American Bus Association, testified on May 3 before the Senate Finance Committee that as the result of higher fuel costs since the imposition of the fuel tax, "there are fewer bus stops [and] the very poor, very elderly and very rural are mostly affected" because they disproportionately ride buses and fuel costs are passed on to passengers.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, since the fuel tax is a flat 4.3 cents per gallon, it is regressive.  Because three-quarters of those Americans earning less than $10,000 per year commute to work in privately owned autos, a flat tax rate falls disproportionately on these poor as a percent of their income.<sup>3</sup>  Indeed, 1987 Bureau of Labor statistics data show that the poorest 20 percent of Americans devote 8.8 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil while the wealthiest 20 percent devote only 3.1 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil.<sup>4</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The benefit to the economy of repealing the fuel tax would be significant.  Carol Hallett, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Air Transport Association of America, testified that the airline "industry estimates that passing on this [4.3 cents per gallon tax] cost results in five million fewer passengers a year [due to higher ticket prices.  This] correlates to a loss of 1 passenger per flight.  This statistic alone is enough to drop many flights into the loss column, and will surely result in airlines cutting back."<sup>5</sup>  And according to the trucking industry, the 4.3 cent tax adds about $600 per truck annually to the cost of operations.<sup>6</sup>  These costs in turn are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher priced products.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The burden of this tax for 1996 is $5.3 billion for gasoline alone and $7.4 billion total, based on Department of Energy daily use estimates.<sup>7</sup>  Too often ignored, however, is the regional and state disparity in the impact of this tax.  To assess the state-by-state impact of the 4.3 cent tax on motor, distillate, and jet fuel, we calculated the tax for each state based on Department of Energy state summaries of usage patterns for 1993, the most recent year for which complete data are available.<sup>8</sup>  While the pattern among states may have changed slightly between 1993 and today, the estimates of the tax burden in general would be higher than our state-by-state figures because of increases in consumption.<sup>9</sup>  According to this calculation, the drain on California alone is $772 million based on 1993 usage, while New York and Pennsylvania combined, with about the same number of people, have a cost of $586 million.

April 8, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>WALTER WILLIAMS:</b> I'm going to talk about the morality of taxation and, of course, the flat tax. While we're talking about taxation, I am going to spend most of my time raising some moral issues involved with taxation in general. Whether we like to think of it as such, our fiscal problems, as well as many other problems in our country, are rooted in immoral government conduct.
<p>

Let me start by referring to the United States Constitution, what I prefer to call the "citizen's rule book."  To say something meaningful about taxation, one must also say something about expenditures, and Article 1, Section 8 of our Constitution is very relevant to today's discussion. Article 1, Section 8 begins by granting Congress authority to lay and collect taxes. In the passages that follow, if you read carefully, Article 1, Section 8 enumerates a broad range of about 19 activities for which Congress can use its taxing authority. These 19 activities, for those of us who have not bothered to read the Constitution lately, include a common defense, the coining of money, and the establishment of post offices and courts, among other things.
<p>
I have not done the numbers on this, but I am guessing that the amount of money necessary for Congress to pay for these constitutionally authorized functions of the federal government would come to no more than $400 billion or so at the most. Obviously, that amount differs significantly from today's expenditure level of $1.6 trillion, and even that $1.6 trillion does not capture the total spending because we have the underground federal government, the so-called off-budget expenditures, as well as government-mandated spending by citizens, such as Americans with Disabilities Act, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency dictates.
<p>

I do not believe that we can restore government to its proper role in a free society by focusing our energies only on the taxation part of the equation. In saying this, I in no way wish to demean the yeoman-like efforts of all those who have worked to come up with a better method of taxation. But I see much of the debate between the flat tax and the national sales tax or our current tax code as boiling down to a question of which is the best way for government to subjugate its citizens (although this is not a meaningless question, because if we have to accept subjugation, I suppose some forms are better than others).
<p>

The debate over what form of taxation we should have somewhat legitimates the level of government spending; and I have always argued, as a number of colleagues have, that it is spending, not taxation, that is the true measure of the burden of government. You see this by recognizing that there is no necessary reason why government has to tax in the first place. At one extreme, Congress could raise all the resources it needed simply by printing currency, or could borrow and require its citizens and other entities to hold a portion of their holdings in government securities, as is done in some countries. Of course, there would be severe problems associated with either one of these methods of taxation, but the bottom-line point is that government spending, not taxation, is the proper measure of government activity, and that is the major problem that needs to be addressed.
<p>

Throughout most of our nation's history, up to the beginning of the 20th century, the federal government spent no more than 3 or 4 percent of GNP, except during wartime. It did not make much difference what form of taxation supported federal government activity. In fact, excise taxes carried the burden. But even during this interval, and even if we had had today's income tax code, there would not have been much of a problem raising 3 or 4 percent of GNP. Almost any kind of tax system would not have much of a problem raising 3 or 4 percent of GNP. I am sure that if that were still the case, we would not be gathered here today to discuss substituting a flat tax for the current code.
<p>

Some people might ask, and some Congressmen might ask, what forms of congressional spending should be cut so that we would not have to worry about the form of taxation. A French philosopher, Frederic Bastiat, gave us the best guide in a little book called <I>The Law</I>, wherein he suggested a way of identifying legal plunder. Bastiat said -- and you can think about our government while I am reading this quote -- "See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what that citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime."
<p>

Clearly, at least two-thirds of federal spending fits Bastiat's description of legal plunder, what I prefer to call legalized theft. If we eliminated legal plunder from the scope of congressional activity, the form of taxation could easily be a non-issue; that is, getting us back to 3 or 4 percent of the GNP. Some may wish to quarrel with my description of Congress's business as being that of legal plunder, but just ask yourself: How does Congress get the money for farm subsidy programs, the savings and loan bailout, food stamps, and the like?  Clearly, it uses intimidation, threats, and coercion to take what rightfully belongs to one citizen and give it to another to whom it does not belong.
<p>

If you think I'm being too loose with terminology about intimidation, threats, and coercion, think about April 15. The mission of virtually every Cabinet department in this city is to distribute the loot that Congress collects. There is neither moral nor constitutional authority for Congress to commit plunder. That is the moral issue that we need to address.
<p>

Turning to the Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal, notwithstanding what I have argued so far, there are some benefits to its enactment. First, it would reduce Congress's ability to grant one group of Americans special tax privileges that are denied to another group of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee are two of the most powerful committees in Congress. Their members have the largest political war chest, and the reason is that they are the focus of Washington's lobbying groups, who pay handsomely and work diligently to have favors bestowed upon them. The Armey-Shelby flat tax plan would go a long way toward eliminating privilege-granting by the United States Congress, and that may explain some of the political resistance to having a flat tax.
<p>

Another benefit of the Armey-Shelby flat tax is lower compliance costs. According to various estimates, the compliance costs of our current code include the 5.5 billion to 6 billion hours Americans spend on such activity as recordkeeping, filling out tax forms, going to court, and seeking ways to avoid taxes. The Armey-Shelby flat tax would create a GNP windfall because if Americans were spending those tax compliance hours in productive activity, the country would be considerably richer. Current tax compliance costs are estimated to be equal to the entire annual output of the automobile and truck and aircraft industries combined.
<p>

As evidenced by my remarks, I am a purist -- what the news media, and maybe even some of you, might call an extremist. But I am not such a purist that I cannot see that a flat tax is a major improvement over the status quo.
<p>

If a flat tax is enacted, however, there should be an additional paragraph in the law requiring a supermajority, say four-fifths, to raise it and a simple majority to decrease it. Like the Framers of our Constitution, I do not trust the Congress of the United States. With the current complex tax code, there are numerous legal ways to hide our money from the revenuers. With a simple flat tax, those hideaways would be eliminated. Then, if Congress raised taxes, we would be up that proverbial creek without a paddle.
<p>

<b>J. KENNETH BLACKWELL:</b> <I>The New York Times</I>, in a 1909 editorial opposing the very first income tax, predicted that when men get in the habit of helping themselves to the property of others, they cannot easily be cured of it. The history of our tax code, in economic terms, mirrors the course of most addictions: first, advancing dependence; second, diminished returns; and third, deteriorating health of the afflicted. <p>

The 1.9 percent rate of economic growth experienced by the U.S. economy is not an accident. It is caused in large measure by a tax code that is impossibly complex, overly intrusive, manifestly unfair, and economically destructive. While some people oppose tax increases or favor tax reductions simply because they want to maintain or enhance their disposable income, I favor constraining government taxation because of the negative impact it has on economic growth.
<p>

Higher taxes mean lower rates of growth in income and jobs over time. This has been amply demonstrated in dozens of scholarly studies. Perhaps the most exhaustive recent study was performed by Dr. Richard Vedder of Ohio University for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Looking at the tax history and economic performance of 50 American states for the period 1960 to 1993, Professor Vedder concluded that relatively low-tax states grew nearly one-third faster than high-tax states.
<p>

Income taxes have a particularly adverse impact on income growth. Flat rate income taxes are significantly more favorable to economic growth than progressive taxes. Perhaps income in flat rate income tax states grew about 25 percent faster than did personal income in states with progressive tax structures. Professor Vedder lists over 50 other studies that similarly conclude that taxes adversely impact economic performance, whether measured by income growth, job creation, new business startups, or population change. These studies look at areas within the U.S. during a given period of time or, in many cases, at other countries. <p>


For example, one study of 107 nations by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded, "We find that a balanced budget increase in government spending and taxation is predicted to reduce output growth rates."  Given that, it is desirable to provide a legal framework for fiscal policymaking in Washington that removes the bias that exists in the current system in favor of relatively large government and, thus, high taxation. Special-interest groups can and do use their concentrated financial and political power to overcome the general interest on a continuous basis, leading to spending in excess of desirable levels, as Walter has just demonstrated. By making it more difficult to tax the populace, we can reduce the fiscal drag on our long-term economic performance that high federal taxation imposes. This is a strong argument for a supermajority requirement for legislative approval of tax increases.
<p>

The current federal tax system provides perverse economic incentives to states and local governments. Because state and local income tax payments are deductible against federal adjusted income, state governments are encouraged to levy income rather than other forms of taxes or no taxes at all. Consider two otherwise identical families, both making $75,000 in income, one living in New York and the other living in Texas or Florida. The New York family probably pays $4,000 or more in state and local income taxes, while the Florida or Texas counterpart pays nothing. Because of federal tax deductibility, the New York family probably will pay close to $1,000 less in federal income taxes.
<p>

This is terribly unfair. It violates the concept of horizontal equity, a concept that says that people of similar economic circumstances should pay similar taxes. Beyond that, however, the federal government is subsidizing the citizens of states that engage in very high-tax policies, shown by Professor Vedder and many others to be so destructive of economic growth. The elimination or reduction of that federal deductibility, such as would occur with a pure flat tax, would increase pressures on high-tax states to reduce their income taxes, which would spur economic growth, something that most states in this union desperately need and desire. This, in addition to the economic stimulus that would come from lowering the federal marginal income tax rates, would be a tremendous boon to our nation's economy.
<p>

Moreover, the move to a lower, flat rate federal income tax fits with another theme that virtually everyone in both political parties is supporting, at least rhetorically: the devolution of power back to the states. The current tax code says, in effect, that Washington knows best. States that have high income taxes are considered good, progressive jurisdictions, so Washington rewards their citizens with lower taxes. States that raise revenues more by sales taxes, excise taxes, or user fees are punished relative to states that use high income or property levies. Rather than being neutral on state fiscal policy, Washington is trying to use financial incentives to dictate the nature of taxation.
<p>

What is particularly perverse about this is that the form of taxation Washington is trying to dictate has a particularly adverse impact on growth. Washington is telling the states to tax the production of goods, or the resources used to produce goods, rather than the consumption of income. That is economically wrong; it is inconsistent with empowering states and local governments to do what they feel is best for their citizens. We have an opportunity in this public policy-defining year to set the record straight: to junk the present tax code and replace it with a tax code that positions us for the 21st century.
<p>

When I was 14, I thought I was God's gift to amateur boxing. I won my first four bouts with relative ease. The fifth bout, I got hit so hard in the nose that I had to go home and tell my father that I was going to find a more scholarly career to pursue. I stayed away from the boxing arena until I was a freshman at Xavier University, where Father E. J. O'Connor, a 72-year-old Jesuit, would ask me and a friend of mine, Benji, if we would go to the amateur bouts with him at the old Cincinnati Gardens. We went out and watched 10 bouts. The 11th bout, a young boy from the western side of Cincinnati, also of Irish-Catholic heritage, came out and, before his fight, made the sign of the cross. Benji leaned over and said, "Father, what's the significance of that?"  Father said, "Tiger, it ain't enough if you can't fight."
<p>

I would suggest to you that it is time for us, as the revolutionaries at the grass roots, to move beyond lip service and get into action, put some muscle behind our rhetoric, and make sure that the Congress of the United States creates a tax code and a tax structure that spur economic growth, create jobs, and promote hope and opportunity.
<p>

<b>JOHN FUND:</b> Two dates are very significant to Americans every spring. One, of course, is April 15, when Americans have to wade through all of their tax forms and fill them out. The other one is May 6, which is Tax Freedom Day. That is the day when the average American family will have earned enough to pay its federal, state, and local taxes and begin keeping money for food, clothing, shelter, and all of the things that keep body and soul together.
<p>

The two dates are linked because we have the tax system that we have, because it is overly complex, and because it raises far too much money. Right now, only 29 percent of Americans fill out the tax form that requires itemization; 52 percent of Americans actually have to go and pay someone, a professional, to fill out those forms for them. If you fill out the form 1040, 66 percent of Americans have to pay a professional. There is something wrong with a tax system which requires people to get somebody with an accountant's training to fill out a tax form for them.
<p>

If you go further and look at its intrusiveness, the IRS employs 111,000 people. That is more people than work for the FBI; that is more people than work for the Border Patrol; that is more people than work for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the CIA, and the National Security Agency all combined. It is an enormous apparatus. It is said that perhaps the least believable thing you can say in this country is "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help you."  Well, perhaps the most believable thing someone can say in this country is "I'm from the IRS, and I'm here to hurt you."
<p>

Everyone across both political parties recognizes that this system is broken, cannot be fixed, and is irredeemable. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt put it, I think, better than anyone: The tax system has become a test of legal brainpower and the ability of accountants to conduct a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and tax breaks. Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives.
<p>

The IRS has become the very symbol of what is wrong with the American government. In order to clean it up, proposals are laid on the table like the flat tax. The flat tax is a way to shrink the IRS from the monolithic and intractable bureau it is today to a simple clearinghouse of information.
<p>

The flat tax as a concept, of course, is enormously popular. The flat tax was attacked mercilessly by almost every candidate in the Republican Party because it was the proposal by Steve Forbes that was most identified with his candidacy. In order to attack Steve Forbes and slow his momentum, you had to attack the flat tax. But the exit polls which were taken as Republican primary voters left the polling booth found that in 18 out of 22 primary states, the flat tax was still supported by a majority or plurality of people voting in those primaries. It received the equivalent of a political mugging, but it is still standing and walking around.
<p>

There are a lot of people who say the flat tax is a far distant goal. Well, not if you look in contemporary political terms. The flat tax was introduced to the American people on the editorial page of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> on March 25, 1981, just over 15 years ago, in a famous essay by Bob Hall and Alvin Rabushka called "The Attraction of a Flat Rate System."  It has picked up adherents ever since. There are now two books on the bestseller list that discuss the flat tax, one by House Majority Leader Dick Armey. It is gathering momentum.
<p>

It is not surprising that it has taken us 15 years to get this far. I think Mr. Blackwell mentioned the first income tax. That was not really the first income tax; that was the first income tax that actually stuck. The first income tax was a peacetime income tax that came about in 1894. It was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, which said that you had to have a constitutional amendment to have such a tax. That effort took from 1894 to 1913, when we passed the Sixteenth Amendment -- 19 years; that is about how long it takes an idea that has irresistible political support behind it to come to realization in America. So I'm not surprised it has taken us 15 years to get this far. At the same time, I also would not be surprised if it takes us only four or five more years to achieve something like the flat tax, because this system is broken and is reaching a critical state of collapse.
<p>

There is another proposal on the table which I think is as significant as the flat tax, and which will be voted on in the House of Representatives on April 15. It has been referred to as the supermajority for raising taxes. This would mean that, as 10 or 11 states now do, you would require two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate to pass a general tax increase. This is an insurance policy to make certain that, once again, the Constitution will have shape and form and will carry with it the force of law. As it is right now, the Constitution has been interpreted virtually into nothingness, as I think Walter Williams indicates.
<p>

We need something more dramatic than what the Founding Fathers envisioned. We need the supermajority, the two-thirds, to raise taxes. Couple that with a simple flat rate system and I think you will have a powerful engine for economic growth, a powerful engine for simplifying people's lives, and a powerful blow for civil liberties in this country. If we achieve either or both of these goals, the supermajority or the flat tax, I think there will come a day when the American people can say that April 15, more or less, is just like any other day -- and wouldn't that be a blessed relief?
<p>

<b>STEVE FORBES:</b> It is good to be here today, to see the flat tax discussed in an environment where you are seeking after truth rather than sound bites.
 I hope it is a theme that others will be picking up in the fall.

Everything we proposed in this year's presidential campaign, particularly the flat tax, had as its purpose -- it sounds like a clich‚, but it's the truth -- to help realize the American dream, which in its essence allows all of us the chance to discover and develop to the fullest our God-given talents. Anything that stands in the way of that, we resisted. Anything that promotes it, we supported. The flat tax is the first of many critical issues that came out of the campaign that will make it possible for America to realize its full potential -- as a people and as a nation.
<p>

One of the things that pundits occasionally do, and historians will do forever, is discuss why Americans were in a sour mood in the 1990s. After all, the standard of living, by any objective measure, is a bit higher than it was in the 1970s or even parts of the 1980s; we did win the 40-year Cold War; we are living longer; the world is looking to the U.S. for leadership. So why are we in a sour mood?
<p>

The answer is simple: We are not fulfilling our potential as a people and as a nation. One of the dangers of this era is that it will be known as the era of missed opportunities. Never in history, and certainly in the 20th century for this country, has a nation had a chance to do more things of a positive nature at home and to be an example of good overseas. Even in 1914, before the first World War, we were simply one of a number of powers in the world. People did look to us, but they looked to other nations and empires as well.
<p>

When the 20th century began, people felt that in spite of all of the problems in the world, this would be an age of material abundance. The rule of law would advance. Even autocratic Russia was beginning to lumber -- haltingly, fitfully, but in the right direction -- toward a constitutional monarchy. Then came the First World War. The devastation of that seemingly senseless loss of life undermined, in the minds of many, the foundations of Western civilization. The rise of communism in Russia, fascism in Italy, and Nazism in Germany following the First World War helped plant the seeds of the Great Depression and, of course, the Second World War. Now, with the Cold War over, we once again have a chance, at least in spirit, to go back to the optimism that began this century.
<p>

In America today is this mindset that we can't grow economically more than 2 percent or 2.5 percent, which is absolutely preposterous. Overseas, countries are looking to us. They want to know: How do we make the transition to a free-market economy?  How do we make it possible for liberty to sink real roots and not be uprooted as happened in the aftermath of World War I?
<p>

We should keep in mind, for example, that in the 1920s and early 1930s democracy was the prevalent form of government in much of the world. Yet, without external aggression, simply because of internal weakness and because the world did not create an environment to make it possible for democracy to sink real roots, democracy in Europe collapsed almost everywhere -- Central Europe, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Greece, Turkey, and Italy. Everywhere you looked, most ominously in Germany and then in Asia because of Japan, democracy quickly collapsed.
<p>

Today we have an opportunity, not for a New World Order where we have direction from above, but to liberate the imagination and energies of people around the world. They are looking for guidance on how to do it, and we have so far failed abysmally in being an example of good -- not only at home but also overseas.
<p>

So the flat tax is a means to an end. This is something that I think our brethren on Capitol Hill have to get used to: that when they explain the issues, such as balancing the budget, they must never forget that the balanced budget is not simply a goal unto itself. It is a means to an end. Otherwise, we sound like accountants looking at numbers as numbers and not as representing real people dealing with real-life problems. That is why the Republicans lost the moral high ground last fall in the confrontation with the White House, and now we have to get that moral high ground back again.
<p>

The flat tax is the first means to revitalizing the American dream. It is no secret to most of you in this room that the tax code today is a monstrous deadweight on American life. It is the principal reason why two incomes in the family can't do the job that one income did in previous generations. As many of you know, a typical family today pays eight times as much in federal income tax on each dollar of income as a typical family did 40 years ago.
<p>

You see the effects of this deadweight in our slow-growth economy. It's not just because the Federal Reserve believes in the crazy Phillips curve that we can't grow more than 2.5 percent without triggering inflation. It is because taxes are not only a means of collecting revenue; taxes are also a price we pay: A tax on income, a tax on profit, a tax on capital gains is a price we pay for working; a price we pay for being innovative, imaginative, and successful. And as we know, when the price of those good things is too high, we are going to get less of them; when the price is lower, we get more of them.
<p>

Yet that seemingly simple insight is lost in policymaking circles in this town. When the Republicans took control of Congress a little over a year ago, they had a chance to get a dynamic model in place in the Congressional Budget Office, but instead they let the opportunity pass by. I remember before I got into the race, when I was with Empower America, I asked one of my opponents, "Why aren't you going for some form of dynamic model?"  "Well, Steve," he said in a tone that only a professor could adopt with a wayward student, "if we keep this old model, that means in order to get tax cuts, we're gonna have to cut spending even more."  He didn't realize that without a dynamic model, you'll get the tax cuts, but at the end of the day you won't get the spending changes as well.
<p>

What the Republicans must remember -- if they ever knew it -- is that if you are going to get long-term changes in Washington, if you're ever going to get serious cuts in spending, serious downsizing and reorganization of government, you must have an environment where fear is not prevalent, where people see that their lives are dramatically improving, that opportunities are there. Then voters will give you the political capital if you wish to use that capital to make those difficult long-term changes. That simple insight is seemingly lost in too many quarters of our party: You will not get economic growth unless you get rid of these high tax rates, and the most effective, dramatic way to get rid of them is with the flat tax.
<p>

But the tax code is also the principal source of power in Washington. For a couple of generations now the favorite activity has been trading loopholes, trading favors for political support and contributions. All you have to do is look at those graphs in Dan Mitchell's book to see what members of tax-writing committees get in contributions versus what their brethren on other committees in Congress get.<sup>1</sup>  The same thing is true of the state legislatures. The current tax code is the principal source of political pollution and corruption in Washington.
<p>

Today, as we all know, even the tax collector doesn't understand what's in the tax code. Half the time, if you call the IRS, even the IRS doesn't know what's in there; but if you take the IRS's advice and it's wrong, you're held responsible for it.
<p>

I liked to point out in my campaign that the Gettysburg Address is a little over 200 words; the American Declaration of Independence, 1,300 words; the Holy Bible, 773,000 words: the federal income tax code, 7 million words and rising. That puts the tax code in perspective. There's no way to "ER" this thing. You can't reform it. You really can't cut around the edges. The only thing you can do with this monstrosity is to scrap it, drive a stake through it, bury it, and hope it never rises again to terrorize the American taxpayer. There is no other way.
<p>

Let me briefly outline what my flat tax plan is. One of the most astonishing things that came out of this campaign was what people thought my plan was or what it was reported to be -- not what it actually was. <p>


The great virtue of the flat tax, in addition to its simplicity, is that it has generous exemptions for adults and children. An adult, for example, would get a $13,000 tax deduction; each child, $5,000. Also, the flat tax is a tax cut; I'll state that up front. When you're on the campaign trail, reporters expect you to say this isn't revenue neutral. No, my plan is not revenue neutral. And they ask with horror, "Why isn't it revenue neutral?"
<p>

"Revenue neutral" gets to the heart of the problem: the attitude that the nation exists to feed the appetite of Washington. What I tried to make clear on the campaign trail was that there are occasions when Washington should have to adjust to the needs of the nation, and under my flat tax plan, it would do just that. With generous exemptions -- $13,000 for an adult, $5,000 for each child -- for the first time since withholding was invented in 1942, millions of Americans would be removed from the federal income tax rolls.
<p>

With those exemptions, for example, a couple would pay no tax on their first $26,000 of income. For a family of four with two kids, it would be the first $36,000. With three kids, it would be $41,000. There are not many families of four in America, outside of a few major centers, that would have $36,000 of tax deductions under the current system. So the flat tax would remove millions of people.
<p>

Any income above those exemptions would be taxed at a simple flat rate of 17 percent. There would be no tax on the personal level -- on your pension, Social Security, personal savings, capital gains, or inheritance. For business, it would be equally simple. Obviously, the transition issues are much more complicated; it would take several years to phase in, especially on the business side. But once it was phased in, you would have a 17 percent rate on the net, and then investments would be written off, expensed in year one: no more ever-changing, complicated depreciation schedules. It makes no sense in this high-tech, information, micro-chip age for Congress, the IRS, the tax courts, or the government as a whole to dictate to entrepreneurs and executives the life of an asset -- to put an arbitrary life on an asset. That should be a business decision, not the government's.
<p>

That is, in essence, the flat tax, or my version of it. The good points of it I thought were self-evident. With that 17 percent rate, we'd get a true boom in the economy -- one that would dwarf even that of the early 1960s when we had growth rates that people today would say are impossible to achieve. In the early 1960s through the mid-1960s up to the Vietnam War, the economy grew almost 5 percent in real terms. That is the kind of growth rate, given the fundamentals of America today, that I think we can achieve again, not forever, but for several years as we begin to bring our new technologies on-line.
<p>

The flat tax is also a fair system because if you make more, you pay more. It is also postcard simple, which was, I thought, a very attractive feature. It is also honest; it rips away the principal source of political pollution and corruption in the nation's capital; and if we can do that in D.C., I guarantee you, you'll quickly do it in most of the 50 states.
<p>

What, then, were the arguments against something that would do so much good for America?  I hate to repeat them here, because many of you know that they are not really valid, but we will be hit with these arguments as this debate heats up.
<p>

First, critics said the flat tax would hurt or clobber housing. Only in Washington would people believe that a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code would somehow be a disaster for housing. After all, you get to keep more of what you earn, you don't have your personal savings taxed, so it's easier to put together a downpayment for a house. Even the Clinton Treasury Department acknowledges that the flat tax would mean lower interest rates, which would translate into lower mortgage rates. And realtors know that the principal determinant of a person's or couple's buying a house is the monthly payment. That is the key factor, and with lower interest rates you would have even lower monthly payments.
<p>

Put these three factors together -- more money in the pocket (not to mention the opportunity for better-paying jobs in the future), an easier-to-put-together downpayment, and lower monthly mortgage payments. How is that a disaster for housing?  No one ever explained it to me, certainly not the realtors. The bogus study they drew on came from one of Forbes magazine's competitors. I will admit I have a vested interest in downgrading DRI/McGraw-Hill, but, in the study they assumed a flat tax rate of 22 percent to 25 percent, not the 17 percent I was talking about.
<p>

Critics said it would be bad for charities. The blunt fact of the matter is that in America, when people have more, they give more. With a flat tax, we'd have more and would be persuaded to give more. The United States is known as a charitable, generous nation; Alexis de Tocqueville talked about it 160 years ago, long before we had a federal income tax.
<p>

Nay-sayers said it would be bad for municipal bond holders because other forms of debt would not be taxed directly to individuals and this would be bad for municipal bonds. No, it would not hurt the price of municipal bonds. When the general level of interest rates goes down, it does not hurt the principle value of municipal bonds.
<p>

What it would mean -- and this is what the issuers of municipal bonds hated -- is more accountability. You know and I know that when you buy a munibond, the only thing you want to know about is does it have a good rating, does it have insurance. Then you buy it. You don't look very hard at what's behind that bond. Well, the issuers of munibonds would not have that advantage anymore, and those products would get the same kind of examination that other forms of debt get -- not a bad thing in terms of political accountability. But in terms of hurting the principle value of the bonds, it wouldn't. If anything, once the flat tax was in place, the price of municipal bonds would probably go up a little bit. What's wrong with that?
<p>

Then the carpers said it would hurt the middle class. Somebody just showed me an item from Sunday's <I>Washington Times.</I> Dick Gephardt is flogging that crazy notion again. He says Dick Armey's plan, which is not much different from mine, will hurt the middle class, raise its taxes several thousand dollars. You know how they can make that statement?  They assume that it will be a flat 17 percent rate on all your income. No exemptions; they leave out the $36,000 of exemptions (in Armey's case, the first $31,000 or $33,000 of exemptions). They leave that out. So a family of four making $45,000 a year, according to Dick Gephardt, would owe a tax of $7,000. You know what the real tax would be under my variation of the flat tax?  About $1,600. Under Dick Armey's, $2,000. Millions of people would be removed from the tax rolls, but that fact also got lost in the shuffle during the campaign.
<p>

Critics said the flat tax would give advantages to rich people, because investment income would not be taxed. As you know, investment income would be taxed, only it would be taxed at the source, at the corporate level. Now, why it was considered populist to say that businesses should not write the checks to the government, that individuals should write the checks to the government, I have not been able to figure out. To give business the tax break, but not the individual, somehow was seen as liberal. Even Pat Buchanan was talking about lounge lizards in Miami getting these breaks.
<p>

For those of you not familiar with the arguments, let me reassure you: Investment income is taxed, only it's taxed at the business level. Businesses write the checks to the IRS, which means the IRS gets the money sooner. Because it's taxed at the source, it also means you get it more efficiently and faster. 
<p>

It's like withholding on your paycheck. When you get a paycheck, your employer takes out, or withholds, all of your taxes, all your payroll taxes, and you get the remainder. The rest is siphoned off, sent to the IRS. The same thing is true for investment income, only in this case the business withholds the 17 percent and writes the check to the IRS. Whatever the company decides to give its shareholders, the taxes on that amount already have been paid. It's taxed at the source, taxed once, taxed more efficiently.
<p>

During the campaign, this was made to sound as if it were going to be a giveaway to the rich, a disaster that would destroy the middle class. Actually, it would revive the so-called middle class, which, thankfully, in America is not static; its members are changing all the time.
<p>

The final argument has great resonance within my party, the Republican Party: that a flat tax would hurt the deficit. Again, you have to remember that the flat tax is a means to an end, just as deficit reduction is a means to an end. My own view is that the flat tax is the only way we're ever going to get Washington's finances reformed, because only if you have a vibrant, growing economy, as I said earlier, will you have the political capital to make those difficult changes.
<p>

The deficit would be eliminated, even by the way Washington keeps its books -- which is a disaster -- because you would have great growth. I think we could get 5 percent growth for several years. You would have more compliance. Even with the convoluted tax code today, whenever tax rates are reduced, compliance goes up.
<p>

There would be the efficiency factor: We spend, depending on whose numbers you use, $100 billion to $103 billion a year just complying with the tax code. We spend up to 6 billion hours a year just filling out tax forms. Already, at least in quality of life, our lives would improve. We would have a couple of extra billion hours a year for doing other things. You would have that efficiency factor in the economy as well, with people able to do more productive things -- at least more satisfying things -- than coping with tax forms.
<p>

And finally, with lower interest rates, you would pay less on the national debt. Not only would people have lower mortgage payments, but also there would be less owed on the national debt, which would also take some pressure off the federal deficit.
<p>

So whatever the arguments are -- whether it's housing, charities, munibonds, the middle class, deficits, or something else -- there are good answers to them. It was remarkable during the campaign that, despite the drumbeat of criticism, exit polls showed that in the primaries a plurality or majority of the voters were still in favor of the flat tax. That shows that information can get through some very distorted or polluted filters.
<p>

Let me close by quickly touching on how we got this tax monstrosity and what a unique opportunity we have to fundamentally overhaul the tax code. The background is very simple. Today's government is primarily a result of the wars that we had to fight in this century. Warfare is a centralizing force. In order to face the external threat, a country has to mobilize the resources of its society. And, with very few exceptions, for the last 80 years, America has faced a major external threat of one sort or another.
<p>

When the income tax was introduced in 1913, what was the top rate?  Six percent?  When did you hit the first 1 percent bracket?  I think you had to earn the equivalent of today's six-figure income before you became even eligible for the income tax. Yet five to six years later, because of World War I, what was the top rate?   Over 70 percent. After World War I lawmakers said, "We can't reduce these rates because it would hurt the budget deficit."
<p>

Fortunately, in the 1920s we got Republican Presidents, Harding and Coolidge and a Treasury Secretary, all vilified by the history books, who reduced tax rates to a top rate of 25 percent. But we got a piece of economic warfare: The Smoot-Hawley tariff. It and other policies waged trade and currency war against the rest of the world, and that led to the massive tax increases of 1932.
<p>

No sooner did the New Deal wind down than we had the Second World War, which, of course, was a great centralizing event in this nation's history. And along came tax withholding. And no sooner was World War II over than we found ourselves in a 40-year Cold War.
<p>

By the early 1960s, even though John Kennedy was reducing tax rates, it was accepted economic thinking that you needed high tax rates because if you didn't have them, the government could not spend money, and people might save too much. They really thought saving was a problem in the 1930s, and even in the 1950s: If we saved too much, the economy would stagnate. Without high tax rates, people would keep their money and might not invest it, might not spend it. And the economy would stagnate. In other words, if people won't use their money, the government will take it away and spend it for them.
<p>

That part of things was true: The government has spent it, and then some. By the early 1960s -- and this is important to understand -- a lot of people in America believed that if a government could win two World Wars, alleviate the distress of the Great Depression, put a man on the Moon, and be in the forefront of the civil rights movement, it could be used as an instrument to solve all of the nation's other problems, at home and overseas. 
<p>

 We have learned some very painful lessons in the last 30 years. We have learned the limitations of government in real-life experiences. Now, with the end of the Cold War, we don't have a centralizing trend. We have learned that at home, government is no more successful than it has ever been in creating utopias here on Earth. We do have a situation overseas, at least for a while, of relative peace. I say relative peace: This administration seems to be doing its best to revive bad forces in the world. We still have a window of opportunity, though.
<p>

We are in the midst of a technology age that is pro-individual, machines recentralizing events in and of themselves, big cities, big corporations, big unions, big government. Personal computers are almost Jeffersonian in their characteristics -- anti-hierarchy, anti-authoritarian; they let anyone roam around the world at will. You have the new age of the economy; you have the end of the Cold War. This is a good time to make fundamental reforms and get away from the debris that grew from the travesties, the errors, and the tragedies of the 20th century.
<p>

Why, then, is there so much opposition?  Why did it take this campaign for people to begin discussing making changes in Social Security, to push medical savings accounts?  And why is it that something so basic as the flat tax -- whether it's my version, Dick Armey's version, or somebody else's version, the concept is the same -- why is there so much opposition to it?
<p>

I think the reason is a basic one: A flat tax strikes at the heart of the power and culture of Washington, even as much as term limits does. That's why it will be furiously resisted. But public opinion -- if you nurture it, if you get out there and explain the flat tax, come out with books like Dan's or Dick Armey's books, go on the talk shows, do some little agitprops, as they used to say -- it can triumph.
<p>

And if that kind of tax reform triumphs, then all of our other reforms will be able to triumph as well. We're not talking about devolving power from Washington to the state municipalities; we're taking a more direct route, directly back to "We the people."  Whether it's parental control of education, term limits, a new Social Security system for younger people, medical savings accounts, and especially the flat tax, it's giving power back to us. If you allow people to keep more of the resources they create, they create more resources. It's that simple, as another would-be businessman-politician likes to say. It is that simple.
<p>

So the flat tax is more than an economic argument. It's more than a pressure-on-two-income-families argument. It gets to the essence of the wonderful potential and opportunities we have in America today. And if we take positive advantage of these opportunities, then the basic thrust of American civilization -- which is inclusive, glued together by a shared set of ideas and ideals; not by race, religion, or common ancestry, but by people sharing a set of ideas and ideals -- can triumph and revive, not only here but overseas as well.
<p>

Will this be an age of realized opportunities?  From my experience on the campaign trail -- even though I didn't go as far as I would have liked -- the answer is a resounding "yes."  You here today are proof of it, and as more people understand the possibilities, it is going to happen.
<p>

The history of ideas is never a smooth one, as some of the textbooks would suggest, and it is never one of inevitability. We have to make ideas happen; but in this new age, with the new tools available, and with people ripe for this kind of reform, we can make ideas become reality.
<p>

I hope that we can work together and can get others to work with us to make these reforms happen. When we do, this generation will be seen as doing what previous generations of Americans have done: as having faced opportunities, faced challenges, and risen to the occasion so that future generations can build on what we bequeath them.

<title>Why A Supermajority Would Protect Taxpayers - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>WHY A SUPERMAJORITY WOULD PROTECT TAXPAYERS</h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel J. Mitchell</a><br>
McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
FYI No. 93<br>
March 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="fyi93.gif">Table 1</a>: How Supermajority States Compare in Gross State Product and Per Capita Tax Revenue
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On April 15th, the House of Representatives will vote on a <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.j.res.00159:">Constitutional Amendment</a> requiring a two-thirds supermajority for Congress to raise taxes. In favor of the amendment are those who believe that lawmakers will be more fiscally responsible and the economy will grow faster if it becomes more difficult for Congress to raise taxes. On the other side are those who believe restricting tax increases would interfere with the majority's ability to determine economic policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be fair, opponents are correct. The proposed amendment would restrict the rights of the majority. But that is precisely the point. Just as the First Amendment is supposed to prohibit the majority from passing laws to infringe upon the rights of free speech and the Second Amendment is supposed to prohibit the majority from passing laws to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms, the supermajority amendment is designed to place limits on the power of the majority to take money from the minority. More specifically, taxpayers are presumed to have a right to their earnings and that only tax increases with very broad support -- as measured by the ability to attract a two-thirds supermajority -- are permissible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is little doubt that a supermajority will make it harder for politicians to take more money from taxpayers. That is why lawmakers who believe taxes should be higher oppose it. Had a supermajority been in place, some major tax increases from recent years would not have become law. Consider:
<p><ul>
<li> The record tax increase pushed through Congress in 1993 by President Clinton was approved by 51-50 in the Senate and 218-216 in the House. Since a single vote-switch in either body would have killed the legislation, a supermajority requirement easily would have saved the economy from the largest tax increase in American history.
<p>
<li> The large tax increase signed into law in 1990 by President Bush was approved by 54-45 in the Senate and 228-200 in the House. Had a supermajority been required, this ill-fated measure would have fallen 12 votes short in the Senate and 58 votes shy in the House.
<p>
<li> Other major tax increases in recent years, including the tax hikes of 1982, 1984, and 1987, also would have been blocked by a supermajority provision.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Needless to say, these tax increases might never even have come up for a vote had supermajority approval been required. Or at the very least, supporters of the tax increases would have had to reduce the size of the hikes and probably make much-needed reforms to spending programs to attract the needed votes. This helps explain why the lawmakers who oppose this in Congress are those who traditionally favor raising taxes -- they fear the supermajority would restrict them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A supermajority requirement would not, of course, block all tax increases. The 1983 Social Security bailout legislation, for instance, imposed a huge tax increase on workers and allowed incumbents at the time to avoid taking needed steps to fix a fundamentally broken system. That legislation did receive more than two-thirds support in both chambers of Congress. Likewise, it is clear that Congress would be able to increase spending, whether financed by taxes or debt, if there was a genuine national emergency. A supermajority requirement during World War II, for instance, would not have impeded the conduct of fiscal policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nonetheless, some critics say that such a requirement would be disruptive, or even disastrous, if it were imposed on Congress. But seven states worked under such a limit for at least 15 years and there is no indication that it has caused any problem. Significantly, not a single state has repealed the provision. Moreover, the seven states which have lived for quite some time under some form of supermajority -- Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Dakota -- have been joined recently by Arizona, Oklahoma, and Colorado. Nevada and Ohio may soon join the list.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ultimately, the debate over the supermajority boils down to a fight about the size of government and the effect of taxes on economic performance. Proponents of smaller government want to use the balanced budget amendment and the supermajority together to slowly shrink the size and power of the federal government. Further, they want to put a brake on higher taxes, which undermine the goals of fiscal responsibility and economic performance. For instance:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Higher taxes typically are followed by bigger deficits.</b> Tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1990, and 1993 have not balanced the budget. Indeed, current CBO projections show the deficit climbing to more than $300 billion within ten years if current policies are left in place.
<p>
<li><b>Higher taxes are associated with higher spending.</b> A 1991 study by the Joint Economic Committee showed that every dollar of higher taxes is associated with more than $1.59 of new spending.<sup>1</sup>  Tax increases are virtually guaranteed to trigger new spending if there is a balanced budget requirement since any new revenues simply allow politicians to satisfy the balanced budget requirement at a higher level of spending.
<P>
<li><b> Higher taxes hurt the economy.</b> Lower taxes in the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s helped trigger economic booms. Higher taxes in the 1930s, 1970s, and 1990s, by contrast, are associated with very mediocre economic performances. The evidence linking taxes and economic performance is powerful. Numerous studies show that nations with low taxes grow faster than countries with high taxes and also that countries can improve their performance by reducing taxes on productive economic behavior.<sup>2</sup>  Similar studies show taxes have the same effect in and among states.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Higher taxes do not collect the promised revenues.</b> Fewer jobs means fewer taxpayers. Lower profits means lower tax collections. Falling incomes mean falling tax revenues. Understanding these simple relationships helps explain why individual income tax revenues have fallen as a percent of GDP since Ronald Reagan left office even though Americans have suffered through two major tax increases.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A supermajority rule is a necessary component of any strategy to shrink the size and power of the federal government, and to limit the power of Congress to tax. High taxes hurt the economy. Not only are five supermajority states below the national average in growth of taxes, but also five are above the national average in overall economic growth (see <a href="fyi93.gif">Table 1</a>). This may be why more and more states have adopted the rule. There is every reason to believe it would have a positive effect on fiscal policy in Washington. Requiring supermajority votes to raise taxes ensures that politicians cannot continue to spend other people's money and evade fiscal responsibility by imposing a higher tax bill on the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A wide range of economic studies demonstrates that states will be better off if they keep their tax burdens low. Curbing taxes limits the growth of government and boosts economic performance. By making it harder to raise taxes, supermajority rule would have a desirable effect on the nation's fiscal policy and overall economic performance. To be sure, a supermajority does not guarantee sound economic policy. The record tax increase approved in California several years ago, for instance, happened in spite of a two-thirds supermajority requirement. And many states without supermajorities, such as Tennessee and Nevada, have scored well in most categories of economic performance (this may be due to these states not having an income tax). When all factors are examined, however, there is no escaping the logical relationship between supermajorities and superior state performance. America would be well served if this lesson were applied to the federal budget.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The presidential campaign has focused national attention on the flat tax. Some candidates in the Republican primary favor the flat tax, and even President Clinton, who currently does not support a single-rate tax system, advocates a fairer, simpler system.<sup>1</sup>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This growing support for the flat tax and fundamental tax reform has enlivened critics who claim that a flat tax system will raise taxes on the middle class. To explore this argument, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the <a href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th?bill=(H ADJ R ADJ 2060)">flat tax proposal</a> put forward by Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), which includes a 17 percent tax, the same rate as proposed by Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes.<sup>2</sup> The analysis used the Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991, the most detailed and complete publicly available database of individual income tax returns.<sup>3</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This analysis of the Armey-Shelby plan shows no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class Americans when compared with their current tax burden. In fact, on average, a 17 percent flat tax would lower taxes on all income groups (see <a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a><sup>4</sup>). Among the key findings:<P>

<b>Question:</b> Does a 17 percent flat tax raise taxes on the middle class?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> No. The majority of taxpayers in every income bracket enjoys a tax cut under an Armey-Shelby flat tax with a 17 percent rate.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> If a married couple gross $60,000 in wages, how much will they save in taxes under a 17 percent flat tax?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> If they also have two children, they will save $2,488 in taxes. That is a 35 percent lower tax bill.<sup>6</sup>
<P>
<b>Question:</b> Does everyone pay the same flat tax rate, even the very rich?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Yes and no. Everyone faces the same 17 percent rate. However, the flat tax taxes only the difference of total income minus the generous family deduction ($33,300 for a family of four). Because the 17 percent tax is levied on the difference, families with incomes of $50,000 to $75,000 pay only 10 percent of their income, while families with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000 pay 16 percent of their income in taxes.
<P>
<b>Question:</b> If everyone gets a tax cut with a 17 percent flat tax, won't that mean lower tax revenues and higher deficits?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> While nearly all individuals pay less tax, many medium- and large-size businesses will pay more. Also, many prominent economists believe that a flat tax will produce a bigger economy, which should result in more federal tax revenues.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Since the Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal eliminates the Earned Income Tax Credit, what happens to low-income taxpayers?  
<P>
<b>Answer:</b> The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) allows low-income taxpayers to claim a credit that generally eliminates their income tax liability and restores some of the income taxed away by the Social Security tax (clearly the largest tax most low-income families pay). The Armey-Shelby bill replaces the EITC with a family deduction that more than doubles current family deductions. While details are unclear, the proposal intends to continue other aspects of the EITC under the government's welfare programs. About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<p>

<b>What Is a Flat Tax?</b><sup>8</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax would repeal the current income tax code and replace it with a system based on the following principles:
<p>
1. Tax all income with no deductions except a generous allowance based on family size. Today's complex system could be replaced by two simple, postcard-size forms, one for business and one for individuals.
<p>
2. Tax all income at one rate, applying the law equally to all taxpayers. Everyone faces the same 17 percent rate, and the government would not punish or subsidize taxpayers on the basis of how they earn or spend income.
<p>
3. Tax all income just once, ending the bias against savings and investment. Capital income would be taxed on the business form to ensure compliance, and labor income would be taxed on the individual form.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal follows each of these principles. For individuals, only the income from wages, salaries, and pensions is taxed. Individual taxpayers add up income from these sources and then deduct generous personal and dependent exemptions. What is left after these deductions is taxed at 17 percent (after a two-year phase-in period). For businesses, taxes are paid on income from the sale of goods or services. The business first adds up all of its income and then subtracts what it paid out in wages and salaries, what it purchased in order to make its products or provide its services, and the cost of all buildings, land, and other "capital structures" purchased during the tax year. The income that is left after these subtractions is taxed at 17 percent.

<P>
<b>Distribution of Tax Payments</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows the dollar and percentage reduction in average household tax payments under a 17 percent flat tax.<sup>8</sup> These estimates combine so-called labor income (wages and salaries) with all of the small business income currently reported on IRS Form 1040, Schedules C, E, and F.<sup>9</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The most striking feature of this flat tax distribution table is how much taxes are reduced for very low and very high incomes. At the low end, millions of households see their tax payments disappear as a result of the generous family deduction. Specifically:
About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no federal income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly everyone else below $30,000 will see their taxes fall.<sup>10</sup>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxpayers at the high end of the income scale also see a substantial reduction in income taxes. These tax cuts result from two factors: the lower tax rate (a drop from an average effective rate of 33 percent to about 17 percent) and an end to the practice of double or triple taxation of so-called passive income (dividends, interest, and capital gains). Dividends and interest actually are payments made by companies to stockholders and depositors out of company income that already has been taxed. Furthermore, individuals buy company stock and make time deposits in savings accounts with after-tax income. Thus, all of the cash transactions associated with, say, a dividend are based on income that already has been taxed. To collect additional tax on dividends, interest, and capital gains constitutes double taxation, thus violating the principle of taxing all income only once and at its source. This double taxation would be ended under the Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxing income only once at its source results in a tax cut at the upper end of the income scale, just as it results in a tax cut for lower- and middle-income households with income from interest, capital gains, and dividends. While nearly 34 percent of all dividends claimed as income goes to households with total incomes below $50,000 (largely households with retired taxpayers), the average dividend income reported by upper-income households is much greater: $37,695 for incomes of $200,000 and above as opposed to $2,050 for incomes of $50,000 or below.<sup>11</sup> Thus, the exclusion of this income from taxes paid by individuals has a greater effect on taxes paid by wealthy people than on taxes paid by people of more limited means.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Because businesses under Armey-Shelby would pay taxes on the income from which they make dividend and interest payments, it is correct to say that the taxes on these payments are withheld at the business level in much the same way that income taxes on wages and salaries currently are withheld at the business level. <a href="fyi90t2.gif">Table 2</a> shows the effects of this withholding on the tax liabilities of households.<sup>12</sup> The dividend and interest payments received by households in <a href="fyi90t2.gif">Table 2</a> have been taxed at the business level, and these taxes are added to the 17 percent Armey-Shelby taxes of <a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a>. A quick comparison of Tables 1 and 2 shows who shoulders the burden of dividend and interest taxes. As income rises, the implicit burden of taxes on these forms of income also increases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is worth noting in this regard that corporate income taxes increase under an Armey-Shelby flat tax. This increase largely offsets decreases in individual tax payments during the tax's two-year implementation period; Heritage's tax models currently estimate that taxes from individuals will fall by $51 billion, while taxes from corporations will rise by $52 billion.
<P>

<b>Progressive Nature of the Flat Tax</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While it is certainly true that the flat tax as proposed by Representative Armey and Senator Shelby taxes income at one rate, the taxpayer and dependent exemption causes the actual rates paid by taxpayers to increase as incomes rise. For example, a single taxpayer without children and making $25,000 would be exempt from income tax on the first $11,350 and would pay a 17 percent tax on the remaining $13,650. The tax would be $2,321, or 9.3 percent of $25,000. If part of the $25,000 was dividend income, of course, tax already would have been taken out at the corporate level. A single taxpayer making $250,000 would pay a 17 percent tax on $238,650 under the Armey-Shelby bill. The tax would be $40,571, or 16.2 percent of total income. It is the presence of the exemption that makes the flat tax "progressive."<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Technical Note</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The data shown in Tables <a href="fyi90t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi90t2.gif">2</a> and <a href="fyi90c1.gif">Chart 1</a> are based on income tax records contained in the IRS Public Use File for 1991, a statistically accurate sample of all individual income tax returns for that year. The file contains 115,000 taxpaying households and 178 tax variables per household. When a variable is multiplied by its weight, the value of the variable equals its national total. Thus, the value of wage and salary income for a family earning $35,000 equals the national total for families in that income class when it is multiplied by its national weight. These are the same data the IRS's own Statistics of Income Division uses when preparing its annual analysis of taxpayers. They are the most accurate and complete tax data available for public use.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tax payments shown in Tables 1 and 2 include all of the kinds of taxable income that individuals now report on their annual 1040 tax form. Individuals currently report labor income (for example, wages and salaries) as well as business income from self-employment, trusts, partnerships, farming operations, and other business activities. However, the more prominent flat tax proposals make an important change in the way small business income is reported. Proposals similar to the Armey-Shelby bill separate labor income from business income and allow businesses to deduct from their gross income the costs of operations, the value of land and capital structures purchased during the year, and the wages and salaries paid to their employees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This separation of labor income from business income makes comparing the current tax system with a flat tax system difficult. In order to compare current taxes fairly with those collected under a flat tax, we added together the flat taxes individuals would pay on their labor income and on their small business income. This combination is reported in the flat tax columns of Tables 1 and 2. Thus, both sets of numbers include taxes paid on labor and business income.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, with respect to the effect higher business taxes might have on low- and middle-income families, many tax analysts believe that higher business taxes mean higher prices for consumers. Low- and middle-income households have more difficulty paying higher prices than do wealthier households. Thus, these analysts argue that increases in business taxes that produce higher consumer prices really amount to regressive "tax" increases on those families least able to pay for them.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While there maybe some truth to this view, the measurement of the relationship between tax changes and price changes is very difficult. First, the flat tax is expected to reduce many of the costs business faces, most particularly the cost of capital. Thus, firms may decide not to pass along tax increases to consumers. Second, more than half of all businesses will see a tax decrease under the Armey-Shelby bill, which could result in lower consumer prices. Third, history shows that firms in competitive markets are less likely to charge consumers for tax increases than firms in regulated, uncompetitive markets. The Heritage Foundation will address this issue in a future paper.

<li>    While the tax reform proposal offered by Mr. Forbes uses the same tax rate as the fully implemented Armey-Shelby plan, the proposals are not identical. The Forbes plan, for instance, has a larger personal allowance.<P>

<li>   Tables <a href="fyi90t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi90t2.gif">2</a> do not show the effect of any special rules to ease the transition from the current tax system to the Armey-Shelby flat tax. Thus, these tables probably overstate the amount of additional taxes some businesses would pay under a flat tax. For example, current tax policy requires businesses to depreciate their equipment purchases over a fixed period of time, often 15 years. Thus, many businesses have a large amount of unused depreciation that they have been carrying on their books as an asset. However, the Armey-Shelby flat tax does away with tax depreciation for capital equipment and replaces this policy with one that permits businesses to expense their purchases of land, structures, and equipment in the year that these items are purchased. To move from the current system to the Armey-Shelby flat tax means either writing off billions of dollars in accumulated depreciation or enacting a "transition rule" that would allow businesses to use accumulated depreciation for a few years as a deduction from gross sales. The Heritage Foundation is engaged in developing and analyzing such rules and will provide commentary on transition issues at a future date.<p>
<li>    Economists and sociologists for decades have been trying to reach agreement about what constitutes the middle class. We certainly will not attempt to enter that debate in this paper. However, broadly defining the middle class as single- and multi-person households with incomes between $30,000 and $100,000 probably includes what most analysts view as middle-class.<p>

<li>    Economists are beginning to publish analyses of how a flat tax would effect economic activity. One of the most important essays to appear so far is by Alan J. Auerbach of the University of California, Berkeley, and the National Bureau of Economic Research. See Auerbach, "Tax Reform, Capital Allocation, Efficiency and Growth," paper presented at Brookings Conference on Fundamental Tax Reform, February 15-16, 1996.<p>
<li>   The Heritage Foundation has published a number of other papers on tax reform and on the flat tax specifically. See Daniel J. Mitchell, "Jobs, Growth, Freedom, and Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1035, May 25, 1995, and Daniel J. Mitchell, "Which Tax Reform Plan Is Best for America?," Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1055.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1055</a>, September 26, 1995.<p>
<li>    The Heritage Foundation used the largest publicly available tax database to construct these estimates. The Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991 is a statistically significant sample of all of the individual income tax returns filed in 1991. Estimates of current average tax payments were calculated by applying the 1996 tax rates and bracket amounts to net taxable income. The estimates of flat tax liabilities were calculated using the provisions of the tax reform proposal advanced by the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, Representative Richard Armey (R-TX), and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL). See <a
href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th?bill=(H ADJ R ADJ 2060)">H.R. 2060</a> and S. 1050.<p>
<li>    See Technical Note.<p>
<li>   For example, the family deduction for a single taxpayer is $11,350; for a married family of four, it is $33,300; and for a head of household with two children, it is $25,450. Only incomes greater than these amounts are taxable under the Armey-Shelby flat tax.<p>
<li>    See Internal Revenue Service, <I>Individual Income Tax Returns 1991</I>, Publication 1304 (Rev. 3/94), p. 28, Table 1.4, cols. 9 and 10.<p>
<li>    It is possible also to view taxes on capital gains as "withheld" taxes: The net present value of corporations is connected intimately to their ability to remain profitable while paying all of their taxes. However, households rather than businesses control the timing of capital gains realizations, which makes the analyst's job of estimating the business tax liabilities for capital gains exceptionally difficult. Thus, taxes on capital gains are not shown in Table 2. If they could be shown, the total tax liabilities of high-income households under a fully phased 17 percent flat tax would be even greater.<p>
<li>    Some advocates of the flat tax say that a taxpayer with 10 times the income pays 10 times more tax. Actually, the flat tax requires wealthier taxpayers to pay somewhat more than that, since the taxpayer and dependent deductions remain the same regardless of income level. In the above example, the richer taxpayer, who has 10 times more income, pays 17.2 times more tax than the poorer taxpayer.

<title>A Republican Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch - Heritage</title>

<h3>A REPUBLICAN AGENDA TO REVERSE THE CLINTON CRUNCH</h3>

<b>By <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey/welcome.html">Dick Armey</a></b>
<P>Dick Armey is Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives and represents the 26th district of Texas.  He spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, on February 27, 1996.

<P>
Can you believe that, in his State of the Union speech, President Clinton actually said "our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades"? I have to say, President Clinton is the Herald of Happy Talk, but this is what my wife Susan calls denial.
<table border=0 align=left>
<tr><td><img src="flnrarmy.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><th>Majority Leader Armey and Heritage<br> President Edwin Feulner</th></tr></table><p>
Only last week Alan Greenspan called the current economy "dismal." The Administration admitted as much when it announced that the economy grew less than 1 percent annually last quarter. This White House is quickly bringing back Jimmy Carter's economic malaise, but now they're calling it a funk.
<p>
The last two years of the Carter presidency were the worst for family incomes since the Great Depression. Ronald Reagan brought families back to prosperity with tax cuts, deregulation, good humor, and optimism. But Bill Clinton is bringing us a return of the middle-class squeeze.
<p>
Millions of working American families gather around their kitchen tables at the end of a hard work week and wonder why it is they can't seem to make ends meet. They work longer and longer hours, they take second jobs, but they feel they are just running in place. They are losing their faith in the American Dream: that their sons and daughters will achieve a higher living standard than their parents and grandparents.
<P>


I lay the blame for America's anxiety at the feet of this Administration. Here's the evidence:
<ol><p>
<li> In each and every year of the Clinton presidency, the typical American family had less real income than when President Clinton took office. Last year alone, the typical family earned $790 less than in 1992.
<P>
<li> The President enacted the largest tax increase in history, and the result is that the typical family now devotes 24.5 percent of its income to federal taxes -- a greater share of income than at any time in America's peacetime history.
</ol><p>

<b>Higher Taxes, Lower Incomes</b>
<p>
These two factors combine to make up the Clinton Crunch: taxes going up and incomes going down. If, instead, families had continued to prosper as they did during the Reagan expansion, the average family would have had $1,274 more last year.
<p>
Republicans want to reverse the Clinton Crunch. We want incomes to go up while taxes go down. Republicans want you to earn more and keep more of what you earn.
<p>
But this Administration would rather feel your pain than deal with it. Secretary Reich, for example, recites the Democrat mantra that real wages for the median worker have fallen 4.6 percent since 1979. He's just reciting the time-worn Democrat party line.
<p>
Income certainly hasn't fallen steadily since 1979. As President Carter completed his term, the nation plunged into recession and wages plummeted. But wages and incomes rebounded during the Reagan expansion years. Tragically, just as families had nearly regained their pre-Carter standard of living, the Democrat Congress and the Bush Administration stalled their forward progress, and now the Clinton Crunch has knocked families backwards.
<p>
What's the lesson here? The only period of sustained wage growth in the last 17 years came as government was cutting taxes and paring back red tape.
<p>
President Clinton didn't just ignore the lessons of history; he defied them. He enacted the largest tax increase in the nation's history and piled on new regulations. It's no wonder that more than half of the wage decline since 1979 occurred under Clinton's watch.
<p>
This Administration and the Democrats think the answer is more government, higher taxes, and more regulation. The President even wants to add new obstacles like a minimum wage hike -- putting the bottom rung of the economic ladder of success out of reach for millions of unskilled workers. The President says he wants to decrease the number of working poor. The trouble is he would do it by making the working poor the non-working poor.
<p>
<b>Bill Clinton: Last Defender of the Welfare State</b>
<p>
In a classic Clinton disconnect, Bill Clinton said that the "era of big government is over," but his actions make it clear that he is the last defender of the welfare state. He stands alone against the tide of reform and renewal rising throughout America.
<p>
More jobs were created in the last six months of the Bush Administration than in these past six months of the Clinton Administration. Bill Clinton inherited a growing economy and quickly trampled prosperity. But that's not all.
<p><ul>
<li>He vetoed the first balanced budget in 26 years.
<li> He vetoed tax cuts for working America and for economic growth.
<li> He vetoed regulatory relief that would have eliminated excess red tape that stifles wages. 
<li>He vetoed legal reform that would have stopped expensive, frivolous lawsuits. 
<li>He vetoed welfare reform that required work and discouraged illegitimacy.
</ul><p>
 Bill Clinton desperately wants to preserve the status quo. He and too many technocrats in Washington are willing to resign this nation to sluggish growth and limited opportunity. We can't settle for that kind of mediocrity.
<p>
But I'm here to bring you good news. Congressional Republicans have an Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch. We must revive prosperity so that working people can once again earn more and keep more of what they earn.
<p>
I have a favorite saying that makes a serious point about the American Dream and why economic growth is the most important goal of Republican policy. Very simply put, every parent knows, deep down, that the American Dream isn't just owning your own home; it's getting your kids out of it.
<p>
Think about it. We struggle through parenthood, sharing our children's hopes and joys and getting them through their disappointments. We're rewarded for all our hard work on that magic day when they burst through the door and say, "Mom, Dad, I got the job." It takes economic growth to create those jobs for our kids so they can start their lives, get married, and finally give us old folks the grandkids we so desperately want to spoil.
<p>
<b>Reversing the Clinton Crunch</b><p>
This is the American Dream, imperiled by the Clinton Crunch. House Republicans have a 9-point <b>Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch</b>:
<p><ol>
<li> Cutting taxes on investment to create jobs; 
<li> Tax relief for working farnilies with children; 
<li> Protecting pensions for working Americans; 
<li> Streamlining regulations that stifle wages and increase prices; 
<li> Reforming the health insurance market to eliminate job lock; 
<li> Putting power in the hands of workers, not bureaucrats, by consolidating worker training programs;
 <li>Enforcing the <i>Beck</I> decision to end the coercive hidden tax that forces union workers to support partisan politics; 
<li> Voting on a tax limitation constitutional amendment to let you keep more of what you earn; and
<li>Continuing our success in eliminating wasteful government spending to use tax dollars wisely and move power back to the states.
</ol><p>
<b>Step 1: The first major step in restoring growth and easing the Clinton Crunch is tax relief.</b> We must cut taxes on investment to get the economy moving again. <b>This year, I am confident we can and will develop a capital gains tax cut that this President can sign</b>. We need capital gains  tax relief so that investment can flow from the stagnant industries of yesterday to the start-up firms of tomorrow, so that a person with a great idea today becomes an employer tomorrow.

<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> We will continue to pursue a child tax credit. When Democrats started their 40-year run as the majority in Congress, the average family paid $1 to the federal government for every $50 they earned. Today, the average family pays $12 to the federal government for every $50 earned. It's time to turn that trend around.
<p>
To  appreciate fully how big the federal tax bite is, I propose that you take the Armey Challenge. Look at your paystub every month, for as many months as it takes, and see if you are paying more for taxes than for food, clothing, and shelter combined. Too many of you will find that government-costs you more than the necessities of life. And that is wrong! <b>We will, again this year, give the President an opportunity to fulfill his campaign promise of a middle-class tax cut.</b>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> One of the largest sources of investment funds today is the pension and retirement savings millions of Americans set aside each year. Pension managers, wanting to get their investors the highest return, seek out the best investments. It's a win for savers, who earn a higher return; for borrowers, who can start or expand their businesses; and for workers, when new jobs are created. But Secretary Reich wants to pre-empt that synergy. He wants the government to choose "winners" and "losers" by redirecting pension funds into "social investment.'' That means lower returns for future retirees, and less investment funds available to start real, productive businesses that create jobs and opportunities. <b>The House passed Jim Saxton's H.R. 1594 last vear to stop Reich's pension grab. I'll ask Senator Dole to move this bill through the Senate so we can send it to the President this year.</b>
<P>
<b>Step 4:</b> Outdated regulations force employers to spend money investing in Washington paperwork instead of productive equipment -- and paying lawyers instead of giving raises to workers. We'll restore wage growth by eliminating unnecessary and job-destroying government regulation. Cutting excess red tape creates more jobs and higher wages, and lowers prices for consumers. <b>In March. the House will pass a regulatory reform bill H.R. 994, designed by Representatives Bill Clinger and Henry Hyde, updating the Regulatory Flexibility Act and requiring Administration review of old regulations</b>. We expect the legislation to be on the President's desk this spring.
<p>
<b>Step 5: In April, the House will vote to end health insurance job lock</b>. Today, too many working parents are afraid to pursue new opportunities, start a new career, or become an entrepreneur because they don't want to lose the health insurance they now have. This year we will bring up legislation centered around Representative Bill Thomas's H.R. 1610 to increase the availability, affordability, and accountability of health care coverage for working families.
<p>
<b>Step 6:</b> Federal job training programs today train workers for jobs that no longer exist. They erect barriers rather than bridges between aspiring workers and the jobs they seek. <b>The House and Senate this year will complete work on Representative Bill Goodling's CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617)</b>, which takes control away from bureaucrats, who are in no position to know where the jobs are, and puts it in the hands of workers searching for training.
<p>
<b>Step 7:</b> The Supreme Court's 1988 <I>Beck</I> decision, which declared that union members cannot be forced to pay dues to pay for anything other than collective bargaining costs, today remains unenforced. As a result, union households are forced to pay dues to support partisan advocacy that violates their core political beliefs. In the <I>Beck</I> case, 79 percent of union dues funded activities other than collective bargaining, including overt partisan political activity. As Thomas Jefferson said, "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical." <b>This year, the House will bring legislation to the floor to end this hidden tax</b>. We must give union families control over how their hard-earned income is spent and restore their right to advocate their own political beliefs.
<p>
<b>Step 8:  On April 15, the House will vote on a constitutional amendment to limit tax increases</b>. The tax limitation amendment puts an end to the cycle of the past 40 years -- special interests in Washington demanding more spending, and Congress raising taxes to pay for it.
<p>
The American people know that cutting spending is the only way to get our fiscal house in order and balance the budget. Economists from all parts of the political spectrum agree that balancing the budget would bring interest rates down by nearly 25 percent -- or 2 percentage points. That means entrepreneurs and small businesspeople can better afford to start and expand firms, hire more workers, and invest in new equipment to boost productivity and wages. And a 2 percentage point reduction in interest rates translates into $1,300 per year in interest savings for a typical family with a home mortgage, a car loan, and student loans.
<p>
<b>Step 9:</b> Finally, we will continue this year to cut wasteful government spending. Two economists I hold in very high regard, Lowell Galloway and Richard Vedder of Ohio University, have done extensive work on the optimal size of government. Their research confirmed what I like to call the Armey Curve. It showed that government spending, up to about 18 percent of the economy, can have a positive impact. But beyond that point, Keynes is wrong -- more government isn't a stimulus; it's an obstacle to growth.
<p>
Today, federal spending approaches 22 percent of the economy. Clearly, there's ample
room to cut. In fact, Vedder and Galloway estimate that each dollar of federal spending restraint
increases private sector spending by $1.38. <b>In plain English, cutting wasteful government
stimulates growth and creates jobs</b>. Since Republicans became the majority in Congress, we put
government on track to cut federal spending by $50 billion this year and last. But that's only a
beginning. This year, we will again cut spending and return power to the states to give the
taxpayers more bang for their buck.
<p>
<b>A New Vitality for America</b>
<p>
This Republican Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch will create a new vitality in our nation. Every family once again will have the opportunity and the freedom to pursue the American Dream so that our sons and daughters can always achieve a higher standard of living than their parents and grandparents. A rising tide of prosperity will lift the fortunes of all Americans --  unless President Clinton keeps us tied to the moorings of big government, as he did last year.
<p>
America faces a momentous choice this year as we decide which of two paths this nation will follow into the next century. Republicans believe we must pursue freedom so that families can earn more and keep more of what they earn. We must put our faith in the ingenuity and goodness of the American people, rather than the guile of the government, to get this country back on track. Ronald Reagan's return to freedom ushered in an era of historic prosperity in this nation. The President would take us down the other path -- the path of the stifling, big-government status quo.
<P>
It is outrageous for an Administration that stifled job creation by hiking taxes to lament joblessness. It is outrageous for those whose red tape choked off raises for working men and women to decry falling wages. The President and other liberals in Washington have the gall to blame Americans for the Clinton Crunch. <b>And it is wrong</b>.
<p>
The "blame Americans" strategy will not work. False promises won't alleviate anxiety about what the future holds. Public hand-wringing will not rekindle our national optimism. Angry words will not create jobs. And class warfare demagoguery will not relieve the Clinton Crunch. 
<p>
America's anxiety will ease only as individual families witness and experience success. Republicans have an agenda to rekindle that success, while the President has only empty rhetoric. It's not enough to say "I feel your pain" when you're the one causing it. The President must accept responsibility for his actions.
<p>
Congressional Republicans have an Agenda to Reverse the Clinton Crunch by relieving the burden of taxes and big government.  Our program will restore faith in the American Dream as families, one by one, prosper through freedom.

<p><hr width=50%></center>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	American taxpayers, disgusted with today's flawed 
tax system, increasingly support efforts to scrap it for something entirely new. With the exception 
of the White House, there is almost universal agreement that America's tax system is anti-growth 
and anti-family. And to add insult to injury, tax laws are mind-numbingly complex, simultaneously 
punishing average taxpayers while creating special preferences for those with the right lawyers, 
accountants, and lobbyists.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		But what should replace the current system?  
Should America have a flat tax?  If so, which flat tax?  Or is the answer a sales tax or value-added 
tax?  Should a new tax system punish success by imposing higher tax rates as income rises?  With 
so many different tax reform plans being proposed, taxpayers understandably need some objective 
way of measuring which plan will generate the most benefits. The following table, based on nine 
criteria, gives an overall grade to each of the major tax reform plans.<sup>1 </sup>
<P><center>

</tr></table>
</center><p>
<b>The Nine Criteria:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>One Low Rate -- because work, saving, and investment should be rewarded, not punished;
<p>
<li>Simplicity --  because the pain of paying taxes should not be compounded by complexity;
<p>
<li>Savings and Investment --  because the tax code should not penalize these activities needed to 
increase growth;
<p>
<li>Social Engineering -- because people, not politicians, should be in charge of how their money 
is spent;
<p>
<li>Intrusiveness/Civil Liberties --  because a tax code granting the government too much power is 
not part of the American ideal;
<p>
<li>Fairness -- because the law should apply equally to all;
<p>
<li>Risk --  because a new tax plan should not contain pitfalls;
<p>
<li>Evasion --  because everyone should pay his fair share;
<p>
<li>International Competitiveness -- because American workers deserve the highest wages and 
living standards.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On these and other criteria, "pure" flat tax plans score 
the highest. Direct consumption taxes also fare well, with their only significant liability being the 
risk that politicians would use them as an additional source of revenue rather than as a replacement 
for the current system. Modified flat tax plans score higher than the current system, but they do 
maintain significant amounts of double taxation and are not graded as high as pure flat taxes. Tax 
reform proposals which resemble the current system, needless to say, fare poorly.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Since no tax system is perfect, any grading scale is 
somewhat subjective. If a reform, or a particular feature of a plan, moves as close to the ideal as 
possible, it earns a grade of "A."  Proposals or parts of proposals that reflect a significant 
improvement over current law receive "B" grades. A grade of "C" means the tax plan or the 
particular feature of the plan was no better or worse than the tax code is today, while "D" and "F" 
grades reflect substantially worsening and worst case, respectively.
<p>

<b>THE NEW TAX PLANS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Several major proposals have been introduced since 
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1055.html">"Which Tax Reform Plan is Best 
for America?"</a>  was published by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> in 
September 1995. This analysis updates that publication with detailed analysis of the plan put 
forward by the <a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">National Commission on Economic Growth and 
Tax Reform</a> (the Kemp Commission) as well as plans prepared by Senator Phil Gramm (R-
TX) and presidential candidates Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The following are the key features of the tax reform 
proposals released in recent months:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Kemp Commission</b> -- The report issued by 
the <a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax 
Reform</a> cannot be graded on the same scale as the other plans because it is not a legislative 
proposal.<sup> 2</sup>  The report, for instance, does not specify a rate and is largely silent on the 
issue of itemized deductions. Instead, the commission's report outlines the key principles of a sound 
tax system and makes several recommendations as to how any acceptable reform package could be 
structured. Many of the general recommendations -- such as tax all income at one rate, but one 
time, and require a supermajority to increase the rate -- are very desirable and will be judged, to the 
extent possible, against the nine criteria.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Forbes flat tax</b> -- Very similar to the 
Armey/Shelby proposal, the <a href="http://www.forbes96.com/html/is_flat.html">Forbes flat 
tax</a> would replace the current personal and corporate income tax systems with a simple 17 
percent tax on all income. All labor income, with the exception of a generous personal allowance 
($36,000 for a family of four), would be taxed at the individual level. Taxes on business and capital 
income (interest, dividends, profits, capital gains, and rents) would be withheld and paid at the 
business level. Unlike the current system, no income would be subjected to more than one layer of 
tax. Both businesses and individuals would be able to use postcard-size tax returns.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Gramm flat tax</b> --  Senator <a 
href="http://www.gramm96.org/cato11796.shtml">Phil Gramm</a> favors a 16 percent tax rate, 
but his flat tax is substantially different from many of the existing proposals. He keeps deductions 
for home mortgage interest and charitable deductions, but the biggest difference is the continued 
double taxation of many forms of income. Capital gains taxes would not be abolished, while 
income used for savings would continue to be taxed twice and the bias against business investment 
would be reduced, but it would not be eliminated. By making these modifications, and also by 
choosing to tax corporate profits at the individual rather than business level, the Gramm plan would 
not achieve the same level of simplicity as a "pure" flat tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Buchanan flat tax</b> -- Similar in many ways to 
the Gramm proposal, the <a href="http://www.buchanan.org/reveal.html">Buchanan plan</a> 
contains a low 15 percent rate, but many types of income are double-taxed. Corporate profits would 
continue to be taxed at both the individual and business level. Savings would be taxed twice. There 
would be a flat 17 percent rate on corporations, but provisions biasing the current system against 
investment, such as the alternative minimum tax and depreciation, would remain. On the individual 
side, the plan also continues deductions for such items as home mortgage interest and charitable 
contributions, thus adding considerable complexity when compared to traditional flat tax plans.
<p>


<b>GRADING THE TAX PLANS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While each reform has an overall grade, it is 
particularly useful to see how the different proposals address specific flaws in the current system. 
The grades in the following section indicate the extent to which different plans reflect nine 
important principles of sound tax policy.
<p>

<b>LOW RATES</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A low, single rate treats all citizens equally under the 
law and ensures that taxpayers have little incentive to hide, shelter, and underreport income. 
Because willingness to work, save, invest, and take risks is tied to the expected rewards of such 
behavior, the lower the tax rate(s), the higher the level of economic growth.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The report does not specify a rate, but makes clear 
that the rate should be as low as possible.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 		A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With a rate of 17 percent, the Forbes plan earns high 
marks.
<P>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	B+
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The low 16 percent rate ranks highly, but the double 
taxation of certain income (discussed in the savings and investment section) is a problem.
<P>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B+
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like Gramm's plan, Buchanan's deserves credit for 
one low rate. It also suffers, however, from the same flaw.
<p>
<b>SIMPLICITY</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The current income tax requires hundreds of forms 
and consumes more than 5 billion hours of taxpayer time each year. Business compliance costs are 
particularly large.
<P>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	N/A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Any plan calling for one rate and taxing income only 
one time will automatically generate substantially greater simplicity. A specific grade, however, is 
difficult without knowing the specific structure of the flat tax and whether deductions would 
remain.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like Armey/Shelby, the entire tax code is 
compressed down to postcard size. All taxpayers need to calculate is their total income and family 
size.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	:&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The plan would have some level of simplification, but 
capital gains, depreciation, itemized deductions, and other provisions limit the scope of benefits. 
Taxing dividends and interest on the individual form will also necessitate continued use of more 
than one billion 1099 forms.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The business side of the tax code, which generates 
the most compliance costs, remains largely untouched. The Buchanan plan also continues the estate 
tax, thus missing an opportunity to remove a source of considerable complexity.

<p>

<b>SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Having one low rate is a necessary feature of a pro-
growth tax system, but it is not the only piece of the puzzle. Equally important is that the tax code 
be designed so that income is taxed only one time. The current system hinders the growth of 
incomes and living standards by the multiple taxing of savings and investment.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The panel makes clear that no income should be 
taxed more than one time. Combined with the low rate, this would generate significantly higher 
levels of capital formation.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like other pure flat tax proposals, the Forbes plan 
does not discriminate against income used for savings and investment.
<p>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some double taxation is eliminated, but the treatment of 
capital gains, savings, and depreciation will leave continued bias against capital formation.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like Gramm, Buchanan errs by not fully addressing 
the bias against savings and investment. In addition to double-taxing capital gains, savings, and 
depreciation, Buchanan retains the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.

<P>
<b>SOCIAL ENGINEERING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The tax code today rewards some types of activity, 
everything from putting a child in day care to buying a home. Other behaviors, however, such as 
savings and investment, are penalized harshly. Once a tax system strays from the concept of 
treating all income equally, regardless of how it is earned or how it is spent, the door is open for 
special interests to add special preferences to the tax code on behalf of wealthy clients.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The report clearly states that the tax system should 
apply neutrally. It does not, however, completely rule out deductions that would shift behavior.
<P>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other than a family allowance, there is no preference, 
loophole, or exclusion in the Forbes plan.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In addition to the bias against savings and 
investment, the Texas Senator's plan retains deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable 
contributions.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shortcomings are similar to the Gramm proposal.

<p>

<b>INTRUSIVENESS/CIVIL LIBERTIES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In part because of the Internal Revenue Code's mind-
numbing complexity, but also because of legislative directives, the IRS engages in tax collection 
activities that many believe are abusive. Moreover, complexity invites government intrusion to 
verify many tax returns. A simple tax code, with easily understood rules that apply to everyone, 
would solve much of this problem. Thus, the highest grades are given to proposals that minimize 
the scope of and opportunity for intrusion.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even without details, it is hard to see how a tax 
system based on the commission's report could fail to eliminate the vast majority of problems. 
Indeed, its very first recommendation is to repeal the entire Internal Revenue Code.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The only possible source of conflict between an 
individual taxpayer and the IRS under a flat tax are total income earned and the size of one's family. 
Whatever other problems remain, such as deductions for the self-employed, would be a fraction of 
those that exist now. Businesses will benefit even more dramatically because of the simplicity.
<P>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Continued double taxation of some forms of capital 
income preserves opportunities for tax avoidance behavior that would necessitate the attention of 
the tax authorities and the maintenance of a layer of enforcement bureaucracy.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the Gramm plan, the Buchanan flat tax is an 
improvement, but many potential conflicts in the tax code will remain.

<P>
<b>FAIRNESS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fairness in the tax system should mean equal 
treatment. Any special provision, whether to punish or reward, violates the principle that the law 
should apply equally.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The recommendations and tone of the commission's 
report clearly indicate strong support for treating all taxpayers and all income equally. Declares the 
report: "[I]f one taxpayer earns ten times as much as his neighbor, he should pay ten times as much 
in taxes."<sup>3 </sup>
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All taxpayers pay the same rate, and all income is 
taxed one time.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The single rate is a dramatic improvement over 
today's code, but the double taxation of savings and investment and itemized deductions undermine 
the goal of equality.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Better than current law, but suffers from the same 
problems as the Gramm flat tax.

<p>

<b>DOWNSIDE RISK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While many tax reform proposals are conceptually 
attractive and would help the economy if enacted, they should not be examined in a vacuum. The 
political process causes any plan to evolve over time, generally in an undesirable direction. Thus, 
the probability of a plan that will retain its beneficial design features should be considered.
<P>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		N/A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As long as no itemized deductions are allowed, a tax 
plan based on the commission's report should be stable and long-lasting. Without clear guidance on 
the use of deductions, however, it is difficult to assign a grade. The supermajority requirement to 
raise taxes, if enacted, would help considerably.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The single rate and purity of the Forbes plan, 
combined with support for a supermajority, provide a significant margin of safety. As with any 
proposal, it is difficult to bind the hands of future politicians completely.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		C+
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One rate is a big improvement, but with double 
taxation and deductions retained, political pressure to include further distortions would soon 
develop. The influence of lobbyists might be curtailed, but not by much.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			C+
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Once again, the plan mirrors both the good and the bad 
features of the Gramm proposal. Government would have the ability to discriminate on the basis of 
how income is earned and how it is spent.
<P>

<b>EVASION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To maintain public support, a tax system must ensure 
that everyone plays by the same rules. If the public views the law as corrupt or unenforcable, there 
will be pressure to return to the old system. This means that the new tax must not create 
opportunities or incentives for taxpayers either legally or illegally to shift behavior just to avoid 
taxes.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Assuming a tax system faithfully follows the report's 
recommendations, it is hard to see how a new tax system could offer many chances to evade taxes. 
It is not clear, however, whether capital income would be collected at the source.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Because of the single low rate, this plan would offer 
minimal incentives to evade. Taxing all income at the source eliminates more than one billion 1099

are double taxed and others maintain a preference. This will encourage taxpayers to arrange their

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the Gramm plan, one low rate will reduce incentives

<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a world where capital can react quickly to changes 
in a nation's business climate, a tax system which minimizes the tax burden will attract increased 
investment. This will translate into more jobs and higher incomes. Unfortunately, America has been 
moving in the wrong direction.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One of the panel's recommendations is to eliminate 
the foreign tax provisions of the current code which do so much to drive jobs offshore and hinder 
the competitiveness of U.S. firms. Combined with the other features -- tax at a low rate and tax only 
one time -- this would benefit America immensely.
<P>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eliminating the double tax on income earned 
overseas and fixing all the problems imposed on income earned in the U.S. will increase 
competitiveness and boost job creation substantially.
<p>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One low rate will help, but the multiple taxation of 
capital will prevent complete realization of possible benefits. 
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			C
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Has the same pluses as the Gramm plan, but the threat of 
higher taxes on trade will have a sharply negative effect on U.S. competitiveness.

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The current income tax system demands 
comprehensive reform. High rates punish success, excessive complexity drains productive 
resources, and punitive taxation of capital income retards savings and investment. Of the many 
proposals that have been offered to correct these flaws, reforms based on the pure flat tax are the 
best. Direct consumption taxes, assuming no loopholes and complete repeal of the income tax (16th 
Amendment and all), are very attractive, with modified flat taxes generally next in desirability. The 
closer a plan resembles the current system, needless to say, the more limited its benefits.

<a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Home Values and Income: Closely Linked; Tax Deduction and Home Values: No Relationship <P>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Last year, the National Association of Realtors 
hired Data Resources Inc./McGraw-Hill, a leading econometric firm, to analyze the economic 
effects of a flat tax. The resulting study concluded that the enactment of this tax, which would 
treat all taxpayers and all income equally, would result in a 15 percent drop in housing 
values,<sup>1 </sup>due largely to the elimination of the home mortgage interest deduction. This 
study is now being used by opponents of the flat tax. Yet numerous experts have pointed out that 
the DRI/McGraw-Hill study has serious methodological flaws that make its conclusions highly 
suspect.<sup> 2</sup> A more reasonable method of analysis -- one that looks at the historical 
relationship between personal income growth and the value of owner-occupied housing, 
combined with the range of estimates showing faster economic growth under a flat tax -- shows 
that home values actually would rise by as much as 7 to 14 percent by the fifth year after 
enactment of a flat tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These results should come as no surprise.  As <a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates, home values consistently have mirrored changes in personal income. When the 
economy is strong and incomes rise, consumers spend more on almost all goods and services. As 
a major component of family budgets, housing has followed this pattern. Although projecting the 
value of housing into the future involves a level of uncertainty, a wide range of studies indicate 
that adoption of a flat tax would boost the annual rate of growth in gross domestic product (GDP) 
by at least 1 percentage point for a period of five or more years.<sup>3 </sup> Because personal 
income would rise with increases in GDP, it is possible to use the strong historical relationship 
between income and house values to generate estimates of how home values will change under 
the flat tax.<sup>4 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Critics of the flat tax argue that it is improper to use 
historical data to predict the future value of homes under a flat tax because, they say, the 
relationship between home values and personal income exists only in a world where mortgage 
interest is deductible. Yet if the deduction were indeed the critical variable, there should be a 
strong relationship between housing values in the past and the tax value of the deduction. In 
1980, before the Reagan marginal tax rate cuts, for instance, a dollar of home mortgage interest 
cost an upper-income taxpayer only 30 cents. In 1988, that same taxpayer paid 72 cents out of 
pocket for every dollar in interest payments. As <a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a> indicates, however, the tax value of the 
deduction had no discernible impact on the value of housing over the period.
<p>


<b>Why the Realtors' Study Is Flawed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If the historical evidence and economic projections 
suggest that a flat tax will increase home values, why did the realtors' study predict a sharp 
decline? The reason is that it used several very questionable assumptions. For example:
<p>
<b>1. DRI/McGraw-Hill analyzed a flat tax with an initial rate of 25 percent, gradually 
phasing down to 21 percent.</b> The DRI/McGraw-Hill study used a much higher tax rate 
than is used in existing flat tax plans. Crucially, the lower the rate, the larger the economic gains 
under a flat tax, and the higher the positive impact on home values. Even the Clinton 
Administration's Treasury Department, no friend of the flat tax, refused to use a rate higher than 
21 percent when estimating the effects of a flat tax on the economy.
<p>
<b>2. DRI/McGraw-Hill did not properly estimate the drop in interest rates under a flat 
tax.</b> According to the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, interest rates would drop by 25 
percent to 35 percent under a flat tax.<sup>5 </sup> Other experts have similar estimates.<sup>6 </sup> DRI/McGraw-Hill stands alone in basing its estimate of likely interest rate declines -- and 
thus the positive effect on home values -- on the comparison between municipal bond rates and 
10-year federal bonds, rather than interest-bearing assets of equal risk such as high-grade 
corporate bonds.
<p>
<b>3. DRI/McGraw-Hill overestimated by 30 percent the average marginal tax rate which 
applies to homeowners.</b> Doing so significantly overstates the tax benefits of the deduction 
and exaggerates the change in a taxpayer's cost of mortgage interest under a flat tax.
<p>
<b>4. The study assumed that financial assets would lose value under a flat tax.</b> This 
assumption is at odds with academic analyses of the flat tax and defies common sense. Lower 
taxes on savings and investment actually would boost the value of financial assets by increasing 
the after-tax stream of income they produce.
<p>
<b>5. DRI/McGraw-Hill failed to include the impact of higher disposable incomes on home 
values.</b> The study does conclude that the flat tax would increase economic growth but fails 
to factor back in the effects on house prices. This is inexplicable.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The flat tax represents a direct threat to 
powerful vested interests that feel they benefit from today's deductions. Unfortunately, many of 
these special interests are willing to disseminate erroneous information to Americans in an effort 
to preserve the tax breaks they now enjoy. The DRI/McGraw-Hill study is based on an unsound 
methodology which leaves it alone in its dire predictions that housing values will fall. Historical 
evidence on the relationship between performance of the economy and house prices, however, 
clearly shows us that a flat tax would be a bonanza for homeowners.

<title>Why Liberals Should Support the Flat Tax -- Heritage</title>

<center>
<h3>WHY LIBERALS SHOULD SUPPORT THE FLAT TAX</h3><br>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel J. Mitchell</a><br>
McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 85<br>
February 7, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The flat tax continues to gain support across the country as more and more Americans realize that the existing tax code cannot be fixed and should be replaced by a fair and simple tax code. Polls show that workers, investors, savers, entrepreneurs, farmers, small business owners, and the elderly are among the groups of Americans drawn to the proposal because they feel they will pay less in taxes, benefit from a faster growing economy, or simply avoid the hassle of today's mind-numbing tax code.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is one group, however, which should support the flat tax but has yet to do so: liberals. Consider the following eight features and consequences of a flat tax which one would expect to appeal specifically to this group:
<p><ul>
<li> The key philosophical principle of the flat tax is equality. All taxpayers play by the same rules, no matter how wealthy they are.
<p>
<li> Lower rates result in the rich shouldering more of the tax burden. This happened in the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s.
<p>
<li> Deductions disproportionately benefit the wealthy and others able to exploit loopholes. Eliminating them with a flat tax allows for a lower rate for those with lower incomes.
<p>
<li> Radically simplifying the code with a flat tax will help end the corrupting effect of tax lobbyists and prevent politicians from exploiting the tax system to generate campaign contributions.
<p>
<li> Because of a generous family-based allowance, the poor are shielded from the income tax burden. A family of four pays no income tax on their first $33,000.
<p>
<li> The flat tax will boost wages and income for lower-income and middle-income workers by eliminating the double, triple, and sometimes quadruple taxation of capital.
<p>
<li> A pro-growth tax system will reduce the budget deficit by increasing the tax base and reducing demands for government spending.
<p>
<li> Lower-income and middle-income taxpayers will enjoy a more financially secure retirement if they are not forced to pay a double tax on their savings.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History illustrates that a flat tax will generate immense benefits for Americans of all backgrounds and incomes.<sup>1</sup>  Honest liberals -- those who are genuinely concerned about helping the less fortunate and who favor eliminating special advantages for the rich and powerful -- should be among the strongest supporters of sweeping tax reform. There are some on the left, however, who oppose the flat tax in the belief that some short-term political advantage can be gained from fomenting class warfare -- even if the ultimate victims are those who have the most to gain from a more rapidly growing economy.

<p>
<b>EIGHT REASONS FOR LIBERALS TO SUPPORT A FLAT TAX</b>
<P>
<b>1. A flat tax promotes equality.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals often say they are fighting for equality. No other word better describes the flat tax, whose key principle is that the law should apply equally to all taxpayers and all income. More specifically, supporters of the flat tax believe all taxpayers should play by the same rules and that government should not grant special preferences or impose special penalties based on how income is earned or spent. Equality under the law means a tax system with just one rate for all levels of income. Anything else explicitly allows the government to discriminate among taxpayers and ultimately is self-defeating.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi85c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows how the principle of equality applies to taxpayers with different taxable incomes. Under a system that treats citizens equally, a taxpayer with twice as much taxable income as his neighbor pays twice as much in taxes.
<p>
<b>2. The rich pay more.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals often equate a fair tax system with one that results in the rich paying more. If so, the flat tax is the answer to their prayers. Why?  While the flat tax is designed to treat all taxpayers equally, history strongly suggests that one effect of moving to a flat tax is that the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich actually will increase. America has had three major episodes of tax rate reduction -- in the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. In each case, lower tax rates removed incentives to hide income, shelter income, reduce earnings, and transfer money overseas. The result: Upper-income taxpayers were willing to earn and report more taxable income, and the amount of tax they paid increased. The evidence speaks for itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1920s, tax rates were reduced from a high of 73 percent to 25 percent between 1921 and 1926. Did the rich get a free ride?  Hardly: The share of the tax burden paid by those making more than $50,000 -- a great deal of money back then -- rose dramatically, climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1960s, the Kennedy tax cuts lowered the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. The result: Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>3</sup>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan reduced the top rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48 percent in 1981 to 57 percent in 1988 (see <a href="fyi85c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).<sup>4</sup>
<p><b>3. Deductions help the rich.</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals presumably do not favor laws that confer special advantages on those with more income. Thus, the elimination of all loopholes, preferences, credits, exclusions, subsidies, and deductions under the flat tax should be particularly attractive to them. As <a href="fyi85c3.gif">Chart 3</a> illustrates, the three best-known deductions offer almost no benefit to the poor and middle class. Upper-income and wealthy taxpayers, by contrast, benefit immensely.

<p>
<b>4. A flat tax ends special-interest tax lobbying.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are 12,609 special interests officially registered to lobby in Washington, and the tax code is one of their chief targets.<sup>5</sup>  Former Members of Congress, former legislative staff members, consulting firm employees, and law firm partners are among those who can earn up to $500 an hour wielding influence in the tax-writing committees of Congress. It is precisely this process that has caused America's tax system, which began in 1913 with one simple form, to turn into a monstrosity encompassing more than 600 forms in which even the simplest -- the 1040EZ -- is accompanied by 33 pages of fine-print instructions.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While lobbyists are very well compensated for their efforts (and not all of them are looking for special loopholes; some are fighting to keep their tax bills from increasing), the biggest winners from the convoluted tax code are the politicians. <a href="fyi85c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows the average contribution levels for members of the House tax-writing committee compared with the average for other House members. This is one reason why the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees are considered the plum assignments for new Members of Congress.
<p>
<b>5. The poor pay no tax.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The only loophole in the flat tax is the one that protects the poor. Under the Armey-Shelby proposal (H.R. 2060, S. 1050), a family of four does not pay the 17 percent rate until its annual income reaches $33,300. This personal allowance, which is indexed to inflation to prevent bracket creep, is considerably above the poverty level and will ensure that even the low rate of a flat tax is not an impediment to those trying to climb the economic ladder.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As <a href="fyi85c5.gif">Chart 5</a> illustrates, the personal allowance also has the effect of making the tax system progressive. The tax rate on a family of four with $30,000 of income would be zero compared to an effective rate of 2.8 percent for a family with $40,000 of income and 5.7 percent for a family with earnings of $50,000. The effective rate continues to rise with income, reaching 9.5 percent on $75,000 of income, 11.3 percent on $100,000 of income, and 14.2 percent for a family with income of $200,000. For the well-to-do, the effective rate approaches 17 percent, as families with $500,000 of income pay 15.9 percent and a millionaire's household would pay 16.4 percent.
<p>
<b>6. A flat tax promotes higher wages.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Considerable discussion has been devoted to the plight of the middle class. While some assertions are false (for example, middle-class incomes have not fallen over the last 20 years), there is no question that earnings could and should be rising at a faster rate. Fortunately, there is widespread agreement among all economists that the way to increase incomes is to make workers more productive by giving them more and better tools with which to produce. As liberal economist Paul Samuelson has written:
<p><blockquote>

	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates.<sup>6</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Or consider the views of the White House. In the 1994 Economic Report of the President, the Administration noted that:<P><blockquote>	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reasons for wanting to raise the investment share of the GDP [gross domestic product] are straightforward: Workers are more productive when they are equipped with more and better capital, more productive workers earn higher real wages, and higher real wages are the mainspring of higher living standards. Few economic propositions are better supported than these -- or more important.
</blockquote><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History shows a very close relationship between worker income and productivity, indicating the importance of capital formation. Since the flat tax eliminates the multiple taxation of capital income, levels of savings and investment will climb, worker productivity will increase, and wages will rise.<sup>7</sup><P><b>7. Budget deficits are reduced.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another desirable feature of the flat tax, at least for liberals, is that government <a href="fyi85c6.gif">revenues will rise</a>. As discussed earlier, the United States has had three major periods of tax rate reduction -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. In addition to the fact that the rich paid a greater share of the tax burden and the economy boomed, these reductions resulted in dramatic increases in tax revenues.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1920s, the top tax rate was slashed from 73 percent in 1921 to 25 percent by 1926. Because of improved incentives to work, save, and invest, income tax revenues increased substantially, rising from $719 million in 1921 to nearly $1.2 billion in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent during a period of virtually no inflation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The White House today would do well to heed the words of then Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, who wrote that "The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income. The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the Government nor profit to the people."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy proposed a series of tax rate reductions that resulted in legislation which reduced the maximum rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965. Just as happened in the 1920s, tax revenues again grew significantly, rising by more than 16 percent between 1963 and 1966.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As President Kennedy remarked in 1962, "an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits.... In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now."<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation which together reduced the top tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988. As supporters predicted, the tax cuts triggered the longest peacetime expansion of the economy in the nation's history. Critics charge, however, that Reagan's program caused big deficits.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These accusations may resonate politically in some quarters, but they are false. Reagan's critics conveniently forget that the first tax rate reductions, in 1981 and 1982, were offset by bracket creep and previously legislated payroll tax increases. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut, beginning in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent (28 percent after adjusting for inflation) by 1989.<sup>11</sup><p><b>8. Americans will have a more secure retirement.</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America's Social Security system is in deep trouble. The bipartisan entitlement commission estimates the system's unfunded liability (the differences between how much is promised and how much will be available) at a staggering $7.3 trillion. With the baby boom generation approaching retirement, the Social Security Administration projects that the system will begin to run a deficit in less than 15 years. While there are ways to avert this upcoming catastrophe (the best option would be to follow the Chilean example of privatization),<sup>12</sup> it is widely expected that lawmakers will be reluctant to address such a politically charged issue.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This approach, unfortunately, means that the so-called baby boomers will face significant benefit reductions compared with what they are being promised and will be forced to augment their retirement income with private savings. The current tax system, however, punishes those who attempt to save and invest by imposing double, triple, and even quadruple taxation of savings and investment income. Even if income is "only" double-taxed, the effect on savings is dramatic. Chart 7 shows the difference in the nest eggs of someone who saves $1,000 a year under the current system and someone who saves the same amount in a flat tax world in which income is taxed just once. As shown, the double tax on interest income imposed by today's code dramatically redu
ces the amount which can be saved for retirement. By taxing income only once, the flat tax would allow interest earnings to compound, resulting in a nest egg almost 92 percent larger than the same amount of savings would generate under current law. See <a href="fyi85c7.gif">Chart 7</a> for the comparison between private savings with and without a flat tax.  
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. tax system ostensibly is designed to make the rich pay more and improve living standards for those with lower incomes. Even a cursory examination of the facts, however, underscores that the biggest victims of a progressive income tax which punishes success are precisely those who are on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. By achieving the effects outlined above, a flat tax therefore should attract the support of well-meaning people of all ideological persuasions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is a particularly important test for liberals. They must decide which is more important: maintaining lobbying power in Washington and keeping a tax system that may satisfy an ideological impulse to punish success, or adopting a system that ends special-interest corruption and helps boost the living standards of the less fortunate.

<title>Why Combining “Kidsave” with a Child Tax Credit Makes Good 
Sense -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>WHY COMBINING "KIDSAVE" WITH A CHILD TAX CREDIT 
MAKES GOOD SENSE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br> 
Vice President and Director of Domestic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 444<br>
February 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As congressional leaders and the 
White House continue to argue over a balanced budget plan, a proposal 
known as "KidSave" has resurfaced. First unveiled last October by Senators 
Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) and Robert Kerrey (D-NE), KidSave would enable 
parents eligible for any new child tax credit created in tax legislation to place 
that credit in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) in their child's name. 
This is a valuable and important proposal. If congressional supporters of the 
$500-per-child tax credit were to include this feature in their plan, it would 
help build Democratic support for the tax plan. And if adopted as an option 
for parents in a final compromise tax bill, this innovation would help provide 
financial security for children while significantly improving the tax code.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;KidSave would work as follows. If a 
parent was eligible for a child tax credit of $500 per year (the amount in the 
vetoed Balanced Budget Act), the parent could place that amount of money 
into an IRA in the child's name. As that account grew over the years, taxes 
would be deferred on the principal and earnings while the funds remained in 
the account -- just like a conventional IRA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The rules governing KidSave IRAs 
would be exactly the same as those for conventional IRAs, with one 
exception:  The child could take funds out of the account temporarily in the 
form of a ten-year loan (much as certain life insurance and pension plans 
allow loans against equity), without incurring taxes at the time, to help pay for 
higher education. Otherwise, as with conventional IRAs, after-tax funds could 
be withdrawn without tax penalty by the child when he or she reached age 59 
1/2, or withdrawn earlier with a penalty.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The original Lieberman-Kerrey 
proposal would have required the child tax credit to be placed in a KidSave 
IRA. Such a restriction understandably found little support among lawmakers, 
especially conservatives. Besides introducing unacceptable restrictions on the 
right of parents to decide how best to use the money for their children, the 
requirement would have had the effect of denying immediate help to children 
in many low-income families, where basic day-to-day needs are a higher 
priority than a more secure retirement. In the discussions now taking place 
over KidSave, the consensus is that placing tax credit money in a special IRA 
should be an option. Such an option would be a welcome reform of the tax 
code, since it would reduce the double-taxation bias against savings, making it 
more likely that working parents would set aside funds to help secure their 
children's future. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Allowing parents to set up IRAs for 
their children would help children in two particularly important ways.
<P>
1.) The KidSave option would give children a large financial cushion against 
the doubtful ability of Medicare and Social Security to deliver adequate 
benefits in the future. The Medicare trustees warned the nation last year that 
the Medicare hospital trust fund will run out of money by 2002. Congress 
passed reforms that would help delay the exhaustion of the fund, but President 
Clinton vetoed that legislation. Even if the congressional reforms became law, 
however, they could not guarantee solvency of the program when today's 
newborns reach retirement, only delay the eventual collapse. Similarly, the 
baby boom generation will impose such heavy burdens on the Social Security 
retirement program that the following generation will have little or no 
prospect of getting back even the money they pay into the system, let alone 
any return on their contributions.
<p>
2.) KidSave would make it easier for today's worried parents to establish a 
retirement fund for their children as a cushion against the probability that 
Medicare and Social Security will be inadequate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although $500 per year into an IRA 
may seem a trivial investment in a child's retirement, compounding would 
lead to a substantial nest egg. For example, consider the case of parents 
deciding to take advantage of the KidSave option for their newborn and 
placing $500 per year into an IRA for 18 years (the maximum under the 
vetoed congressional tax credit plan). Assume a real rate of return of five 
percent. Even if the child, as an adult, added nothing to the IRA, it would be 
worth $140,000 in today's dollars when he or she reached 65 (the Clinton-
proposed credit, which is smaller, available for only 13 years, and more 
restricted, would be worth $100,000 -- assuming the child was eligible).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;KidSave would give the child an 
additional means of financing his or her higher education. With the cost of 
college an enormous barrier to higher education for the children of many 
working families, permitting these families to invest in a KidSave IRA would 
provide a means of shouldering the burden. Under the proposal, children at 
college could borrow against their KidSave IRAs, paying back the loan (into 
their own retirement accounts) over the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Again, compounding leads to 
significant funds for such a loan. Assuming the same case described above, 
the child would have just over $14,000 in his or her account at age 18, in 
today's dollars. This compares with an average cost (tuition and required fees) 
of $10,500 for four years at a public college (by contrast, an eligible child 
would have a maximum of $10,400 under the Clinton proposal).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The KidSave proposal, combined 
with the tax credit for families with children, thus would be a significant 
savings vehicle to help families deal with the cost of college and the future 
uncertainty of Medicare and Social Security. And it is good tax policy, since it 
moves closer to a proper treatment of savings in the tax code. But placing 
their child tax credit in a KidSave IRA should be an option for families, not a 
requirement (as under the original proposal), so families can decide for 
themselves whether the credit should be used for urgent immediate needs or 
future security. As an option, KidSave would be a very welcome 
improvement to legislation to provide much-needed tax relief to families with 
children.

<title>Why Tax Relief Is Necessary in a Balanced Budget -- Heritage</title>

WHY TAX RELIEF IS NECESSARY IN A BALANCED BUDGET </h3>

<p>
<a href="tax_relf.gif">Table</a>: A Balanced Budget With Tax Relief Would Add $142 Billion to GDP...
<p>
Some policymakers maintain that tax relief is out of place in the quest for a balanced budget. They 
argue that tax cuts cannot be justified because they make the goal of a balanced budget even harder 
to reach.
<p>
But contrary to this view, the inclusion of tax cuts should be viewed as a critical component of any 
balanced budget plan. The reason is that reducing or eliminating tax relief on income from capital 
would lower potential economic growth significantly and would not in fact make room for new 
spending.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation recently used one of the principal econometric models of 
the U.S. economy to project the economic and fiscal effects of eliminating the tax relief elements of 
the congressional balanced budget act. This analysis shows:
<p><ul>
<li>The congressional balanced budget plan with tax cuts, as vetoed by President Clinton, would 
add $112 billion more to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the next seven years than the same 
congressional plan <i>without</i> tax cuts.
<p>
<li>The reductions in taxes on capital (including the capital gains tax relief) accounts for $66 
billion of this additional GDP and leads to a stronger economy in the long run.
</ul><p>
Heritage Foundation economists conducted this analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan 
using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates. Laurence H. Meyer 
& Associates is a nationally recognized consulting firm specializing in economic 
analysis.<sup>1 </sup>  The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, 
including the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the National 
Association of Realtors, and the National Association of Home Builders.<sup>2 </sup>
<p>
The congressional tax relief plan includes a reduction of taxes on families and on capital. The lower 
taxes on family income include primarily the $500-per-child tax credit, a reduction in the marriage 
penalty, and the adoption tax credit. The lower tax rates on income from capital include tax changes 
affecting capital gains, individual retirement accounts, the alternative minimum tax, and the estate 
and gift tax provisions.
<p>

<b>The Benefits of Reducing Taxes on Family Income</b>
<p>
The cornerstone of the reductions in taxes on family income is the $500-per-child tax credit. The 
immediate benefit of the $500-per-child tax credit included in the congressional balanced budget is 
an increase in household disposable income. Although $500 may seem insignificant in light of the 
entire federal budget, it is a substantial benefit to individual families. As demonstrated by previous 
Heritage analysis, a family with a newborn baby could save the entire $500 each year for eighteen 
years and afford the tuition costs at an average public university.<sup>3 </sup>  Alternatively, an 
average family with two children could use the $1,000 credit to purchase one month's supply of 
food and mortgage.<sup>4 </sup>  This additional private sector savings and consumption made 
possible by the $500-per-child tax credit and other reductions in family income taxes will benefit 
the economy.
<p>
<b>The Benefits of Reducing Taxes on Capital</b>
<p>
The cornerstone of the reductions in taxes on capital is the capital gains tax relief. Owners of 
appreciated assets sell those assets largely for one of two reasons: either to meet extraordinary 
expenses (educational, medical, or other large and non-recurring costs) or to move their money 
from an inferior to a superior investment. When government takes less of this income, household 
spending stimulates economic activity and more efficient investment fuels economic growth. 
<p>
Not surprisingly, the impact of a capital gains tax cut on investment and economic growth is more 
important in the long run than its role in allowing households to pay big bills. Two reasons for this 
relative importance stand out. First, reducing the tax on capital gains lowers the cost of moving an 
investment from an average company to one that is exceptionally productive and well run. This 
lowering of the "switching" costs means that investors will play a larger role in promoting well run, 
productive companies. Thus, the economy as a whole is likely to be more efficient. Second, lower 
taxes on capital cause the cost of capital to fall. Lenders, for example, do not require quite as much 
interest on their capital loans in order to recoup the taxes they paid when they made the capital 
available to a borrower. Lower capital costs usually mean more investment by businesses in labor-
saving equipment, which commonly results in increased labor productivity. This increased 
productivity gets translated into higher wages and, through the wonders of the division of labor, 
more jobs.
<p>
The following <a href="tax_relf.gif">table</a> compares the level of various economic indicators that result from the 
congressional balanced budget plan with tax relief and the congressional balanced budget plan 
without tax relief. Specifically,
<p><ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product would be $13.7 billion more in the year 2002 as a result of the 
congressional plan <i>with</i> tax relief compared to the same plan <i>without</i> tax relief.
<p>
<li>Real disposable income would be $23.1 billion more in the year 2002 as a result of the 
congressional plan <I>with</i> tax relief compared to the same plan <i>without</i> tax relief.
</ul><p>
Removing capital gains tax relief from the congressional balanced budget will not allow increased 
federal spending. The capital gains tax relief element of the congressional balanced budget plan 
actually <i>reduces</i> the deficit in every year through 2002. There are two reasons for this. 
First, a reduction in the capital gains tax rate will produce more declarations of capital gains and 
thus increase government revenue from the capital gains tax. Second, the capital gains tax reduction 
creates a stronger economy, thus increasing the federal tax base. 
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains (perhaps as high as $7.5 
trillion) exist in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>5</sup> Some economists have 
estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial economic benefits 
and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments. In an article last year for the 
<i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William Randolph, two leading tax 
economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated the response of taxpayers to 
rate reductions as being on the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one percent drop in the rate, capital 
gains realizations would rise by 6 percent.<sup>6 </sup>  The federal government would collect tax 
revenues on these "windfall" capital gains that under the current tax rate would not have been 
declared.
<p>
The congressional tax relief proposal, including the capital gains tax reduction, would allow 
individuals and owners of capital to keep more of the money they otherwise would have paid in 
taxes. This additional private sector savings and spending would be allocated more efficiently than 
had the federal government spent the money and thus will lead to a stronger economy. A stronger 
economy, in turn, means a larger tax base from which the federal government can draw revenue.
<p>
The important complement to this analysis is that, contrary to popular belief, additional spending 
opportunities for the federal government would not be available if the capital gains tax relief 
element of the congressional balanced budget plan is eliminated. In fact, additional spending 
reductions would be necessary in the future to offset the potential revenue foregone by elimination 
of the capital gains tax reduction.
<p>
<b>TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS</b>
<p>
To conduct the simulation of the congressional budget plan, Heritage economists adjusted only 
those elements of the Laurence H. Meyer & Associates baseline forecast that deal with federal 
spending and federal tax policy. 
<p>
The analysis is based on spending reductions specified in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, passed 
by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton on December 6. For specific assumptions concerning 
these spending reductions see, William W. Beach and John S. Barry, <a href="fyi69.html">"What 
a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,"</a> Heritage Foundation 
F.Y.I. No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
The major components of the congressional tax relief package were accounted for in the following 
manner:
<p><ul>
<li>A 50 percent exemption of individual capital gains was assumed for taxation purposes through 
2004. The maximum corporate capital gains tax rate was reduced from 35 percent to 28 percent.
<p>
<li>The average effective tax rate on individuals was reduced according to the annual value of the 
$500-per-child tax credit.
<P>
<li>Other provisions of the congressional tax relief package were accounted for by changing the 
effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.
</ul><p>
The analysis in this paper is based on the November economic forecast and projection of Laurence 
H. Meyer & Associates. This is the most recent economic forecast available from Laurence H. 
Meyer & Associates.
<p>
Note: Reduction in tax on income includes: family tax relief, the reduction in the marriage penalty; 
and the adoption tax credit. Reduction in tax on capital includes: tax changes affecting capital gains, 
IRAs, the alternative minimum tax, and the estate and gift tax provisions.

<title>How A Capital Gains Tax Cut Would Boost State Revenue -- Heritage</title>

HOW A CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT WOULD BOOST STATE REVENUES</h3>

<a href="gain1.gif">Chart</a>: Estimated One-Time State Revenue Windfall...
<p>
The vetoed congressional budget plan would significantly cut effective taxes on capital gains, both 
for individuals and for businesses. The Heritage Foundation estimates that this important tax cut 
could cause millions of taxpayers to declare billions of dollars in capital gains during the first year 
of the lower effective rates. Because 40 states require taxpayers to report all capital gains declared 
on their federal tax forms, this sudden growth in capital gains may create a one-year state income 
tax windfall of $9.5 billion.

If taxpayers were to "unlock" appreciated assets during the first year of lower capital gains taxes 
under the congressional budget plan, states that tax capital gains would likely see their income tax 
revenues increase by an average of 11.6 percent.
<p>
Some states might experience an especially high one-time percentage increase in their income tax 
receipts. For example:
<p>
<a href="gain1.gif">Chart</a>: Estimated One-Time State Revenue Windfall...
<p>
The reason for this state tax "windfall" actually is quite simple. Reducing the tax rate for capital 
gains actually increases tax revenues from taxpayers who own appreciated assets. Experience over 
the last 25 years with changes in capital gains tax rates strongly indicates that rate decreases 
produce more declarations of capital gains and more capital gains taxes. Owners of appreciated 
assets who face high tax rates generally hold on to or "lock up" their assets in anticipation of lower 
future rates. When the rates come down, the amount of capital gains declarations goes up.
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized or "locked up" capital gains (perhaps has 
high as $7.5 trillion) exists in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>1 </sup>  Some 
economists have estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial 
economic benefits and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments.<sup>2 </sup> In 
an article last year for the <i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William 
Randolph, two leading tax economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated 
the response of taxpayers to rate reductions as being in the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one 
percent drop in the rate, capital gains realizations rose by 6 percent.<sup>3 </sup>
<p>
The accompanying table shows three different state "windfall" scenarios, representing the range of 
expert opinion on how declarations are affected by a change in the rate. Each scenario uses the 
actual capital gains declarations by individuals as reported in the IRS's Public Use File for 
1991.<sup>4 </sup> The first set of columns shows the low estimate, which is calculated by 
multiplying the drop in the effective tax rate by 0.17. This means a 50 percent decrease in the 
effective capital gains tax rate results in a 51 percent increase in capital gains declarations. The third 
set of columns shows the high estimate, which multiplies the 50 percent decrease by the "transitory 
tax elasticity" estimated by Burman and Randolph: 6.42. While Burman and Randolph offer solid 
evidence for this strong level of taxpayer response to a change in the capital gains tax rate (which in 
the table leads to a 321 percent increase in declarations), it is probably imprudent for states to 
budget on this optimistic outcome. Thus, the second set of columns shows the midpoint between 
the low and high responses. The midpoint estimates reflect an increase in declarations of 156 
percent for a 50 percent drop in the tax rate.
<p>
As always, the difficult part of estimating tax revenues from capital gains is forecasting the value of 
the appreciated assets taxpayers will liquidate and the time of their liquidation. No particularly good 
and reliable revenue model exists for this purpose. Thus tax analysts are left with calculating 
historical responses to tax changes and assuming that the future will be very much like the past. 
<p>
Thus, these Heritage "mid-point" estimates, based as they are on data from a slow economic year 
and a mid-range level of taxpayer response, should give state revenue officers a reasonable number 
for incorporating into their state income tax forecasts. These middle estimates also illustrate 
conservatively that what happens to capital gains at the federal level has important implications for 
the revenues of 40 states. Besides the good economic effects on state economies resulting from a 
balanced budget with tax cuts, the congressional budget plan actually supplies the states with 
additional revenue that they can use to meet their additional responsibilities. If, on the other hand, 
the capital gains cut were to be pared back or eliminated in the negotiations over a budget, that 
would reduce or eliminate the revenue benefit to states with a capital gains tax.

<p>
Congress's plan to balance the budget over seven years with tax cuts, vetoed on December 6 by President Clinton, would significantly improve the housing of many renters and homeowners while lowering their housing costs. According to an econometric analysis by The Heritage Foundation, adopting the spending and tax policy changes contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would likely lead to:
<p><ul>
<li>104,000 additional housing starts worth $11 billion over the period 1996 through 2002;
<p>
<li>New or improved housing for 1.8 million Americans;
<p>
<li>A drop in mortgage interest rates, with total payments on a $100,000 mortgage about $10,000 less in today's dollars over 30 years than a mortgage purchased under current budget and tax law; and
<p>
<li>A 4 percent drop in the cost of housing by 2002 (principally through decreases in the cost of capital and lower interest rates), with the value of existing housing maintained at or near current levels by the growing demand for new homes.
</ul><p>
This good news on housing reflects the stronger economy that economists at The Heritage Foundation predict would result from the vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995.<sup>1</sup>  Incomes and output would rise, inflation and interest rates would fall, and the spending and tax cuts proposed by Congress would lead to significant growth in productivity and investment. Each has a positive effect on housing. Specifically, the boost in new home construction would produce widespread benefits, and the tax policy provisions of the Act would lead simultaneously to lower housing costs.
<p>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> conducted this analysis of the congressional budget plan using an economic model of the U.S. economy developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economics consulting firm whose model is used routinely by major private firms and by such public agencies as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Congressional Budget Office.
<p>

<b>Growth in New Home Construction</b>
<p>
For a graphical representation, see <a href="chart4.gif">Additional Housing Starts with a Balanced Budget and Tax Cuts</a>
<p>
The healthier economy that flows from Congress's tax and spending cuts produces two important effects on family housing.
<p>
First, the tax reductions, particularly the cuts in capital gains taxes, would jump start a boom in new investments by households and businesses.<sup>2</sup>  The Meyer model indicates that investors would pour an additional $11 billion (adjusted for inflation) into the housing sector as a result of the congressional budget plan. Without the tax and spending cuts, these new investments in family housing likely would not be made.<p>Home builders would use these new funds to construct an estimated 51,200 new single-family homes and 52,800 new multi-family dwellings over the seven-year period from 1996 through 2002.
<p>
This construction activity would mean employment and income growth in the housing industry, in the banking and real estate sectors, and in thousands of other companies that sell new homeowners everything from telephones to tabletops.
<p>
Second, these new investment dollars would provide improved housing for nearly 700,000 families. The model projects 7,200 starts of 2-to-4-unit dwellings and 45,600 starts of 5-or-more-unit dwellings. Assuming that all dwellings in the 2-to-4 category are actually 2-unit dwellings and all in the 5-or-more category are only 5-unit buildings, then the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 could provide new apartments for 288,000 families. Add to this number the 51,200 families who would be moving into single-family housing, and it becomes apparent that Congress's budget plan will significantly improve the housing of many Americans. Specifically: 
<p><ul>
<li>An additional 339,200 families could move into new housing over the next seven years as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. Assuming a national average family size of 2.63, this means 892,100 people could enjoy new housing over this period.<sup>3</sup><P><li>Assuming that the 339,200 dwellings vacated by these families who are moving up in housing are purchased or rented by another 339,200 families looking to improve their own housing, the total number of people affected by these new housing starts could be 1,784,200.</ul><p>
<b>Reduced Housing Costs</b>
<p>
While the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would contribute significantly to the welfare of Americans through its salutary influence on housing, the legislation's benefits for homeowners and renters would not end there. The Act's role in stimulating the growth of investment and reducing the after-tax cost of capital (largely through reductions in the effective tax rate on capital gains) reduces the cost of housing. The Meyer model projects that the cost of housing will be 4 percent lower by 2002 than it otherwise would be under current law. Two factors explain this drop in the relative price of housing.
<p>
First, Congress's budget plan would reduce the costs of capital directly by reducing the effective tax rate on capital gains. For example, if Jones is thinking about cashing out an appreciated asset (say, a company stock) and loaning the proceeds to Smith, who is building an apartment building, Jones will consider the taxes he or she must pay on the capital gain as an important part of making the loan. If Jones paid a high capital gain tax, then he or she will demand a higher rate of return on the investment. Thus, dropping the effective tax rate on capital gains works to lower the cost of capital for those who borrow. The Meyer model predicts that the after-tax cost of capital by 2002 would be a full percentage point lower than it would be under current law.
<p>
Because capital costs are an important part of the costs landlords must cover by the rents they receive, one highly possible outcome of tax cuts is lower than expected rental payments by families in apartments or single-family rental property.
<p>
Similarly, the prices of new single-family homes will rise less rapidly in a world with tax cuts than in a world without them for the very same reason:  Homebuilders will be paying less for the capital they need for home construction.
<p>
Second, the relative price of housing would drop under the vetoed plan because mortgages would be less costly. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 not only would cut the effective rate on capital gains, but also would permit middle and lower income families with children to keep $23 billion more of their income each year through the child tax credit. The Meyer model indicates that families would use a portion of this money to buy stocks and bonds and to increase their personal savings accounts. These actions would increase the supply of funds available for investment. Thus, the mortgage interest rate (like all of the major interest rates in the Meyer model) would fall because the after-tax cost of capital would decline and the supply of investment dollars rise.
<p>
For a graphical representation, see <a href="chart9.gif">Conventional Mortgage Rates: Current Law vs. a Balanced Budget</a>
<p>
The 0.4 percent drop in the mortgage interest rate from what it otherwise would be means that a $100,000 home loan would cost about $10,000 less in today's dollars over a typical 30-year loan repayment period.
<p>
Lower borrowing costs would allow more families to enter the housing market, which would contribute to price stability in housing and the preservation of household net wealth.
<p>
This important role of lower interest rates -- preserving the value of all homes through the competitive price bidding of home buyers -- explains in part the impressive growth in household net worth by 2002:  The Meyer model projects that, at the end of the seven-year balancing period, households will be worth nearly $200 billion more than they otherwise would have been under current law. 
<p>
It is benefits of this magnitude that President Clinton has foregone through his veto. Not only does the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 inadvertently create a "housing program" of significant proportions; it also contributes to a general improvement in family financial well-being.

<h3><I>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #6:
WHAT A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS WOULD MEAN FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE RETIREES</i></h3>

Congress's balanced budget plan with tax relief, vetoed on December 6 by President Clinton, would expand the purchasing power of today's seniors and allow younger Americans to save more money for their retirement. These are the findings of an analysis by The Heritage Foundation using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy.<sup>1</sup>  According to this statistical analysis, the congressional plan would mean:<p><b>For Current Retirees</b><p>A retiree showing $2,150 in capital gains for 1995 would realize $245 in additional after-tax income from a reduction in the capital gains tax.<p>A senior citizen with only $25,000 per year in nominal dollars for retirement could see an increase of $1,125 in real purchasing power over the next ten years due to decreased inflation.<p><b>For Future Retirees</b>
<p>
A worker saving $500 annually before taxes in the proposed "super IRA" for 40 years would realize an additional $3,070 in today's dollars compared with putting the same amount in a conventional IRA.
<p>
A 25-year-old couple raising one newborn child could save $41,150 in today's dollars for their retirement by saving the $500-per-child annual tax credit.
<p>
A young couple buying a home with a $100,000 mortgage could save $33,890 in today's dollars for their retirement from decreased monthly mortgage payments.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan using the economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates,<sup>2</sup> a nationally recognized economic consulting firm. The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, such as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Office.<sup>3</sup><p>The positive benefits to current and future retirees from the congressional balanced budget plan are discussed below. These include increased after-tax income from lower capital gains tax rates; expanded purchasing power from lower inflation; and increased potential retirement income from super IRAs, the $500-per-child tax credit, and lower mortgage rates.<p><b>Benefits to Current Retirees</b><p>Increased After-Tax Income from Lower Capital Gains Taxes. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 lowers the effective tax rate on capital gains by 50 percent for individual tax filers through a deduction of half the net taxable gain. Thus, an individual in the 28 percent tax bracket would see his effective tax rate on capital gains drop to 14 percent.<sup>4</sup>  Contrary to popular belief, the capital gains tax reduction is not a tax break enjoyed primarily by the rich. The typical household declaring a capital gain in 1991 had income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> of $58,729.<sup>5</sup>  For seniors claiming a capital gain in 1991, the average income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> was $43,637, with an average gain of $2,151.<p>A reduction in the capital gains tax is particularly important for today's retirees who have invested in capital assets as a means of saving for their retirement. There are two major reasons why the capital gains tax cut is so important to seniors:<p><ul><li>Senior citizens claim a disproportionate amount of capital gains. Households containing taxpayers 
who are over the age of 65 or blind constituted only 3.5 percent of all returns in 1991 but accounted for more than 27 percent of taxpaying households declaring capital gains. 
<p>
<li>Current law imposes a surtax on Social Security benefits. For example, a retiree facing a base marginal tax rate of 15 percent also must pay a surtax of 7.5 percent. This is why many individuals face higher marginal tax rates during their retirement than over the rest of their lifetime.<sup>6</sup>  Thus, the 50 percent exclusion may be more valuable during a taxpayer's retirement years than during his working years.
</ul><p>
To understand the benefits of the capital gains exclusion for seniors, consider a newly retired couple realizing $2,150 in capital gains during 1995. If this couple faces the lowest marginal tax rate of 15 percent and the Social Security surtax of 7.5 percent, they will receive only $1,665 in after-tax income from these gains. Under the congressional balanced budget plan, however, this same retired couple would realize $1,910, an increase of $245 over current law.
<p>
To put this in perspective, an additional $245 amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>One month of groceries for the average retired household, or
<p>
<li>Six months of housekeeping supplies for the average retired household.
</ul><p>
<b>Increased Purchasing Power from Lower Inflation.</b> Many senior citizens have saved a fixed amount of money for their retirement years. Seniors living on a fixed income are affected directly by inflation because it changes the purchasing power of their money. As inflation increases the prices of goods, consumers are able to purchase less:  Inflation eats away at purchasing power. Because retirees, as a rule, are more likely to be restricted to a fixed income, they will benefit disproportionately from a slower rate of inflation.
<p>
The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that prices likely will increase more slowly in the future because of a more efficient economy spurred by a balanced federal budget and tax relief. By 2002, inflation rates are projected by this analysis to be 0.7 percent below what is expected under current law. This means consumers will be able to purchase more goods with the same amount of money. For example, a retired household living on a fixed income of $25,000 per year will see their purchasing power increase by $1,125 in today's dollars over the course of the next ten years.
<p>
To put this in perspective, an additional $1,125 amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>The amount an average retired household will spend on laundry and household cleaning over the next ten years,
<p>
<li>The amount an average retired household will spend on fresh milk and cream over the next ten years, or
<p>
<li>One-half the amount an average retired household will spend on furniture over the next ten years.<sup>7</sup></ul><p><b>Benefits to Future Retirees</b><p><b>Benefits from Super IRAs.</b> Current laws allow tax-free deposits of up to $2,000 per year in contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). However, withdrawals from these IRAs made during retirement years are taxable. The tax provisions of the congressional balanced budget plan would create a new kind of IRA, known as a super IRA. Contributions to a super IRA would be taxable; however, withdrawals could be made tax-free. As Bruce Bartlett, an economist at the National Center for Policy Analysis, notes, "If the tax rate is the same at the time of deposit and the time of withdrawal, taxpayers would be indifferent between the two types of IRAs. However, most middle-income workers will face higher tax rates during the years of their retirement, because of the Social Security benefits tax."<sup>8</sup>  Therefore, retired workers will not face the higher tax rates associated with retirement when making withdrawals from super IRAs.<p>The <a href="fyi_79.gif">table</a> below shows the advantage of the congressional super-IRA provision. Suppose a young worker decides to invest $500 annually in a conventional IRA. Because these annual contributions are tax-exempt under current law, this worker can dedicate the entire $500 in personal savings. After 40 years of $500 annual contributions, this worker's IRA will have accumulated $129,528 in future dollars. However, under current law, this worker must pay taxes on withdrawals from the IRA. If this now-retired worker faces a base marginal tax rate of 15 percent and the surtax of 7.5 percent, he will pay 22.5 percent of the accumulated $129,528 in taxes, leaving him with an after-tax income of $100,384 in future dollars.
<p>
Now suppose this same worker was able to invest the $500 per year in a super IRA. This worker, facing a marginal tax rate of 15 percent, would be able to dedicate only $425 to the IRA because contributions to super IRAs are not tax-free. Every year he would pay $75 in taxes and deposit $425 in the super IRA. After 40 years of $425 annual contributions, this worker's super IRA will have accumulated $110,099. However, this entire amount can be withdrawn tax-free. Thus, by investing in a super IRA he will have $9,715 more after 40 years in after-tax income for his retirement years. This additional future income is equal to $3,070 in today's dollars.
<p>
<b>Extra Potential Retirement Savings from $500-per-Child Tax Credit.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would benefit 28 million families raising some 51 million children. A 25-year-old couple that has just had a child and decides to dedicate the entire $500-per-child tax credit every year for 18 years to savings for their retirement, and then leaves the balance to continue earning interest for an additional 22 years, could accumulate $41,150 in today's dollars ($101,820 in future dollars) after the 40 years of savings.<sup>9</sup><p>This additional savings amounts to:<p><ul><li>The total amount an average retired couple will spend on groceries over ten years of retirement, or<li>The total amount an average retired homeowner will spend on mortgage payments, property taxes, and home maintenance costs over ten years of retirement.<sup>10</sup></ul><p><b>Extra Potential Retirement Income from Lower Home-Mortgage Rates.</b> The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that households and businesses would face lower interest rates as a result of a stronger economy spurred by a balanced budget and tax relief. Specifically, the simulation projects mortgage interest rates in 2002 will be 0.4 percent below what they are expected to be under current law. This 0.4 percentage point decrease below baseline means that a new home borrower of $100,000 will save $25 per month in mortgage payments.
<p>
A homeowner who chooses to dedicate the extra $25 per month to retirement savings for every month over the 30-year life of the mortgage, and then leaves the balance to continue earning interest for an additional ten years, will accumulate $33,890 in today's dollars ($80,440 in future dollars) after the 40 years of savings.<sup>11</sup> <p>This additional savings amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>The total amount an average senior citizen will spend on utility payments over 15 years of retirement,
<p>
<li>The total amount an average senior couple will spend on dining away from home over 20 years of retirement, or
<p>
<li>The total amount an average senior couple will spend on gasoline and motor oil over ten years of retirement plus a modest vacation every year for ten years.<sup>12</sup></ul><p><b>Technical Assumptions</b><p>For assumptions that underlie the econometric simulation of the congressional balanced budget legislation, see William W. Beach and John S. Barry, <a href="fyi69.html">"What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy</a>," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
For calculations of accumulated savings from the $500-per-child tax credit, it was assumed that the entire $500 was contributed to a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning an annual rate of return of 8 percent. It was further assumed that this accumulated amount was saved for an additional 22 years at an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Inflation was assumed to be 3 percent annually.
<p>
The 0.4 percent decline in mortgage interest rates was projected in the above-cited econometric simulation. It was assumed that the savings from this decline were placed in a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Contributions to the IRA were made over the life of a 30-year mortgage. It was further assumed that this accumulated amount was saved for an additional 10 years at an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Inflation was assumed to be 3 percent annually.
<p>
Middle-income seniors typically face a higher tax rate because of the Social Security surtax on "provisional income."<sup>13</sup>  The effect of this surtax is to place America's middle-income elderly in a special, higher bracket by virtue of their age. For instance, if an individual younger than the retirement age receives $1 from savings, the income tax will take 15 cents in the lowest tax bracket. But some Americans must also pay the Social Security surtax, and a second 7.5 cents on the same $1 of savings could be due under the surtax.

December 11, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%><br>

<bq><i> Now, what the Congress wants to do is to roll back that working family's [Earned Income Tax Credit], in a way that will impose a tax increase averaging $500 a family on families least able to pay it.  This is a tax hike that literally will push many working families back into poverty.<br>
— President Bill Clinton, October 7, 1995</i></bq></center>

<P>
	The White House charged in October that Congress's balanced budget and tax cut plan would raise taxes on families earning below $30,000, because of the proposed congressional reforms in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Yet a comparison of President Clinton's just-released budget (with its provision for a $300-per-child tax credit for dependent children below age 13 in families with annual incomes below $75,000<sup>1</sup>) and the Balanced Budget Act vetoed by Clinton on Wednesday (with its $500-per-child tax cut for all children in families earning up to $110,000<sup>2</sup>) shows that the congressional plan would benefit 5.4 million more low-income working families with children than the Clinton plan. This is so even after accounting for the changes in the EITC in the Balanced Budget Act. The group especially hit under the Clinton budget are many families with children earning below $24,000 per year, who would be denied the $300 child credit under the Clinton plan (receiving only the EITC) and who would be eligible for both the $500 child credit and the EITC under the congressional plan.
<p>
	Overall, the $500-per-child tax credit in Congress's balanced budget and tax cut plan would benefit 23 million more children than the Administration's $300-per-child credit. Congress's plan would give tax relief to 10.4 million families with children who would receive no tax relief under the Clinton plan. In addition, there would be millions of families in which at least one sibling would receive tax relief under Clinton but other siblings would not. Taken together, the total number of children not qualifying for any tax relief under Clinton would be 23 million less than under Congress's plan. These children would receive $15.4 billion in tax relief under Congress's plan but nothing under Clinton's plan.
<p>
	There are three major reasons why the Clinton tax cut plan ends up denying tax relief to so many families with children:


<p>
<b>Reason #1: Clinton's tax cut only benefits families with children under age 13.</b>  Since roughly 25 percent of all children are over age 12, millions of families are denied a tax cut just when the cost of raising that child becomes more expensive. This provision alone denies tax relief to the families of at least 2.8 million children earning under $30,000 per year. This restriction also reduces the average tax cut per family because many families have children below age 13 and children age 13 or older. Indeed, the average tax cut per family under the Clinton plan is $442, but the average tax cut under Congress's plan is $856 per family.
<p>
<b>Reason #2: Clinton's tax cut only benefits families earning up to $75,000 per year.</b> While some 88 percent of all children live in families earning below $75,000 per year, this income restriction denies $2.6 billion in tax relief to nearly 6 million families with children, compared with Congress's plan. Many of these families would by no means consider themselves "rich." For example, a federal worker earning $40,000 per year and his school teacher spouse earning $35,000 could easily find themselves denied tax relief under the Clinton plan.  
<p>
<b>Reason #3: The Clinton plan requires low-income families to deduct their EITC benefits from their income tax bill before they can take the $300-per-child tax credit.</b> By contrast, Congress's plan allows a low-income family to take the $500-per-child tax credit first, and then receive the full measure of the EITC on top of the child credit. As the following table shows, as a result of this difference in which the tax credit is taken versus the EITC, a family with two children would have to earn $24,000 annually before becoming eligible for the Clinton credit. By contrast, under the Balanced Budget Act this family would become eligible for the credit at roughly $17,000 in annual income.
<p><bq>




<b>Example:</b> Say a married couple with two children earning $23,000 per year pays $908 in income taxes. To calculate how much of a tax cut they would receive under the Clinton plan, this family must first deduct roughly $1,170 in EITC benefits from their $908 income tax bill, which results in zero available income taxes from which to deduct the $600 tax credit they might otherwise be eligible to receive. However, under Congress's $500-per-child tax credit plan, this family would first take a tax deduction of $908 (although their two children would otherwise give them $1,000 tax credit, the value of the tax deduction cannot exceed their income tax liability). Then they would receive, in addition, their full $1,170 in EITC benefits ($1,514 after the congressional reforms).
</bq><p>
See Chart 1: <a href="fyi78_2.gif">Tax Savings: Married Couple with Two Children</a>
<p> 
	Combined, these three elements of the Clinton plan make it substantially inferior to Congress's $500-per-child tax credit, even considering the reforms in the EITC. Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li>Clinton's $300-per-child tax credit plan would benefit 23 million fewer children, than Congress's $500-per-child tax credit plan. Some 10.4 million families would get no tax relief under Clinton but would under Congress's plan. Millions of other families would receive reduced tax relief because some of their children would qualify under Congress's plan but not under Clinton's. Taken together, these families would be denied $15 billion per year in tax cuts.
<p>
<li>Compared with Congress's $500-per-child tax cut plan, the Clinton plan would deny tax relief to 5.4 million children in families earning below $30,000 per year in income. Under Congress's plan, these same families would receive $2.3 billion in tax cuts.
<p>
<li>Under the Clinton plan, a single parent with one child would have to earn over $18,500 per year to become eligible for the $300-per-child tax cut. Under Congress's plan, this parent would begin getting tax relief with just over $11,500 in annual income. See Chart 2: <a href="fyi78_3.gif">Tax Savings: Single Parent with One Child</a>.
<p>
<li>Under the Clinton plan, a married couple with two children would have to make $24,000 per year to become eligible for the $300-per-child tax cut. Under Congress's plan, this family would begin getting tax relief at $17,000 in annual income.
See Table 1: <a href="fyi78_1.gif">Income at Which Family Becomes Eligible for Tax Cut</a><p></ul><p>
Even after accounting for reforms in the Earned Income Tax Credit, families with two children earning below $30,000 per year would, on average, receive $132 more each year in tax cuts than under the Clinton plan. Single parents with one child earning below $30,000 annually would receive $187 more tax relief on average than under the Clinton plan. Even this assumes that both of these families have children under age 13 (and thus eligible for the Clinton credit). Since 25 percent of all children are above the age of 12, many of these families would receive far less tax relief on average under the Clinton plan. Congress's plan gives an average of $856 in tax relief per family, whereas the Clinton plan gives an average of $442 per family.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The Administration's $300 per-child credit begins phasing out for families with incomes above $60,000 and reaches zero at $75,000 in family income. The credit increases in value to $500 per child after 1998.

<li>For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes above $110,000 the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000 above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out at $130,000 in income. For families with two children, the two credits this family is eligible for are fully phased out at $150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000 in income.

<bq><i>
"If you take the $500 a year tax credit, and I figure, you know,
$5 for a bottle of wine, that is 100 bottles of wine for a family...."<sup>1</sup></i><br>— Congressman Jim McDermott (D-WA)<br></center></bq><p>	Contrary to what elitists in Washington would have the public believe, for most hard-working American families raising children a $500 tax cut for each child is not an insignificant amount of money. This is especially true as many families no doubt are wondering how they will be able to afford the $432 some surveys report each household expects to spend this holiday season.<sup>2</sup> Yet the families of 51 million children, or over 28 million families in all, were denied relief from their financial worries when President Bill Clinton recently vetoed Congress's seven year balanced budget and tax cut plan, which had as its centerpiece a $500-per-child tax credit. This tax cut would pump over $22 billion per year into family budgets across the country so that working parents can provide for their children in a way no government program can.
<p>
	As congressional Republicans negotiate with the White House on a compromise plan to balance the budget by 2002 and provide tax cuts, they should resist pressure to scale back the $500-per-child tax credit as a price for cutting a deal. Those who argue that Washington cannot "afford" such generous tax cuts while the government is trying to balance the budget are, in effect, arguing for higher spending. The budget will not be balanced any faster if the amount of the per-child credit is reduced below $500 or if the income for which families are eligible is lowered from its current level of $110,000 for joint filers.<sup>3</sup> Any money not put back in the checkbooks of working families with children through tax cuts, is more money in the checkbook for politicians and bureaucrats to spend while the budget is moving toward balance.
<p>
	Congressional and White House negotiators should keep in mind that for parents with two children, the $1,000 tax cut they would receive under this plan could mean the difference between paying the mortgage and not. Indeed, as the table below shows, a $1,000 tax cut for the typical family with two children is enough to pay one month's mortgage and grocery bills, or 11 months worth of electric bills, or nearly 20 months worth of clothing for the children. In other words, a $1,000 tax cut is a significant amount of money for most families' household budgets. 

<p>
	There are also sound policy reasons to cut taxes for families with children:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Families with children are overtaxed.</b> In 1948, the average American family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to Uncle Sam. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent.
<p>
<li><b>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent to giving them one month's mortgage payment.</b> The average family now loses $10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase in federal taxes as a share of family income. This tax loss exceeds the annual mortgage payment on the average family home. The $1,000 in tax relief the congressional tax-cut plan would give to a family with two children would help this family pay one month's mortgage payment.
<p>
<li><b>Millions of families stand to benefit.</b> The families of 51 million American children, or 28 million taxpaying families, are eligible for the $500-per-child tax cut. 
<p>
<li><b>Family tax relief helps families in every state. </b>The typical congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for a $500 tax credit. Thus families in the typical district would receive $54 million per year in tax relief.
<p>
<li><b>Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate the entire income tax burden for 3.5 million taxpayers caring for 8.7 million children.</b> These 3.5 million families will receive over $2.2 billion per year in tax relief. Families with two children earning up to $24,000 per year would see their entire income tax burden eliminated by a $500-per-child tax credit, and families with three children earning up to $26,000 also would have their income tax bill eliminated.
<p>
<li><b>Most families are middle-class.</b> The $500 child credit plan will direct 89 percent of all benefits to families with adjusted gross incomes below $75,000 per year --  middle-income by any standard --  and over 96 percent to families with incomes below $100,000.
<p>
<li><b>Cutting taxes for all families --  regardless of income --  is fair.</b> Congress's plan will cut    the income tax burden of a family of four earning $30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year by 30 percent. Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000 would see their tax burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000 per year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.


</ul><P>
















<center><b>TECHNICAL NOTES ON TABLES</b></center>
<P>
	The following tables represent the best available means of estimating the amount of family tax relief that will go to each state and congressional district from a $500-per-child tax credit. It should be noted that not every eligible family will be able to subtract the full $500 for each child from its tax bill. We have tried to take the following exceptions into account:
<p><ul>
<li><b>The $500 credit is non-refundable.</b>This means that a family cannot get more in tax relief than it pays in income taxes. Example: a family of four earning $20,000 per year owes about $458 in income taxes. Though the $500-per-child tax credit might otherwise get them $1,000 in total tax relief because of their two children, the fact that this credit is not refundable allows them to deduct only what they owe — $458 — from their income tax bill.

<li><b>The $500 credit is phased out for joint filers with incomes above $110,000 per year and single filers with incomes above $75,000 per year.</b> For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes above $110,000 the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000 above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out at $130,000 in income. For families with two children, the two credits this family is eligible for are fully phased out at $150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000 in income and is fully phased out at $95,000 in income.
</ul><p>
	The first two tables, showing the number of households and children by state, were calculated using the 1991 IRS Public Use File.  This data is derived from income tax return forms and the number of dependents claimed on those forms.
<P>
	The tables listing family tax relief by congressional district were calculated using the 1990 Census.
<p>
	Because the sources for the two tables are different, the tax relief calculated for each state will not necessarily equal the sum of tax relief for that state's individual counties. In each case, the source is the most accurate data available for that specific level of analysis.  The differences may be caused by the following facts:
<p><ol>
<li>The IRS data are based on tax returns filed with the federal government.  Not every household files a tax return, however.  For some groups this is by law; Native Americans are not required to file a tax return.  Other individuals do not file because they do not have an income to report.  Finally, some people simply do not file for personal reasons.  These same groups may be counted by the Census Bureau but will not be accounted for by the IRS.

<li>Many people maintain a permanent residence in one county or state but live in another.  These people pay taxes in a different county or state  than where they live.  Again the Census and IRS will account for these people in different locations.

<li>Many people file their tax returns late.  Thus, the data from the 1991 IRS files may not include certain families that would be included in the Census count. Alternatively, the IRS records may include more families (because of people filing from past years) than the Census Bureau count

<title>What A Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean for Family College Costs -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3><i>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #3:  
WHAT A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS 
WOULD MEAN FOR FAMILY COLLEGE COSTS</i></h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 77<br>
December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
Congress's balanced budget with tax relief legislation will allow families with children to save more money for higher education. A balanced budget with tax cuts also will lead to lower interest rates which will benefit students by lowering the cost of student loans. Both of these consequences of balancing the budget over seven years with tax relief mean more highly skilled Americans for future workforces. These are the findings of an analysis by The Heritage Foundation using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy. 
<p>
According to this statistical analysis, the Balanced Budget Act developed by Congress would mean: 
<p><ul>
<li> American families, over time, could save an additional $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund college education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax credit. This would cover the full tuition costs at a typical public university today.
<p>
<li> An average student could save more than $414 over the life of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest rates.
</ul><p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan using the economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting firm.<sup>1</sup>  The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, such as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Office.<sup>2</sup><p><b>INCREASED FAMILY SAVINGS FROM $500-PER-CHILD TAX CREDIT</b><p>The high cost of a college education prices many families out of the higher education market or forces students and parents to incur large amounts of debt to cover the costs of college.<p>The $500-per-child tax credit included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would benefit more than 28 million families raising some 51 million children and could allow many families to save enough money to send their children to college. A family that chooses to dedicate the entire $500-per-child tax credit to savings for higher education would accumulate about $14,066 in today's dollars over 18 years for each child's education. Thus, a family with two children would be able to save an additional $28,132 for college expenses. In today's dollars, an additional $14,066 per child in family savings for education amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li> Five full years' tuition and fees at an average public university; 
<p>
<li> One full year's tuition and fees at an average private university; or
<p>
<li> More than the difference between the four-year cost of an average public university and the two-year cost of an average public community college.
</ul>
<p>
<b>LOWER STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES</b>
<p>
The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that households and businesses would face lower interest rates under the congressional balanced budget and tax cut plan than under current budget and tax policy. Lower interest rates also would benefit students with student loans. A student beginning his or her education in 1996 would face interest rates that averaged half a percentage point below what is expected under current law:  a savings of $414 over the life of an average ten-year student loan.<sup>3</sup>  More young Americans will be able to afford a college education as a result of these savings. In addition, some students who otherwise would have to defer their education plans could enter college earlier, thus increasing their lifetime earnings.
<p>
Alternatively, lower interest rates would allow students to borrow more money for education at the same effective cost. In essence, students would be able to purchase more education for the same price. The additional $414 might be used for such things as:
<p>
<ul>
<li> One full year of books and supplies;

<li> Two additional courses at an average public university; or

<li> About one-third the cost of a personal computer. 
</ul><p>

<b>TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS</b>
<p>
For assumptions that underlie the econometric simulation of the congressional balanced budget legislation, see William W. Beach and John S. Barry, "What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
For purposes of calculating the amount of savings from a $500-per-child tax credit, it was assumed that the money was placed in a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning a real rate of return of 5 percent per year.
<p>
The initial rate of interest charged for a student loan was assumed to be 8.25 percent. The 0.5 percent figure is an average decrease below baseline for the life of a ten-year student loan. This 0.5 percent decrease was projected in the above-cited econometric simulation.

The Heritage Foundation econometric analysis assumes that the Federal Reserve System makes no change in the reserve requirements of its member banks and refrains from stimulating the economy by increasing the growth of monetary reserves.

<title>Who Will Benefit From Cuts in Capital Gains Taxes -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #2:
WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM CUTS IN CAPITAL GAINS TAXES?</i></h3>

F.Y.I. No. 76<br>
December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 contains important changes in capital gains tax policy. Specifically, the bill lowers the effective tax rate by 50 percent for individual tax filers through a deduction for half of net taxable gain. Thus, an individual in the 28 percent tax bracket would see his effective tax rate on gains drop to 14 percent. For corporations, the bill decreases the capital gains tax rate from a maximum of 35 percent to 28 percent. Both changes are effective after December 31, 1994.<sup>1</sup><p>Proponents of these tax policy changes argue that lower capital gains tax rates will stimulate economic growth, improve the fairness of the tax code, and increase federal revenue from the capital gains tax by encouraging individuals to "unlock" gains that they have been unwilling to realize at the currently high tax rate. Critics of these changes argue that lower effective tax rates on capital gains disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans, thus rendering the federal tax system more unfair. The critics also suggest that the "economic stimulus" produced by the reduction in rates will improve principally the fortunes of the owners of capital, not the incomes of other Americans.<sup>2</sup> <p>The work of most economists who have analyzed capital gains taxes and publicly available government data on who pays these taxes all indicate that the proponents are right and the critics are wrong. There are three major reasons why adopting capital gains tax changes as defined in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 will benefit nearly every American.
<p>
<B>First</B>, the benefits of cutting capital gains taxes go mostly to lower and middle income taxpayers rather than to the wealthy. When critics claim that capital gains go mainly to the wealthy, they mislead the public by including the gain when citing a person's income. In this way, a retiree living on a $12,000 Social Security check who realizes a $30,000 capital gain one year on the sale of his house is classified as a "person with a $42,000 income who receives a capital gain." 
<p>
Contrary to what opponents suggest about who will benefit from these tax cuts, the typical household declaring a capital gain had income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> of $58,729 in 1991.<sup>3</sup>  The typical capital gain for this household was $973. About 11 percent of all taxpaying households declared a capital gain in 1991.
<p>
About 19 percent of taxpaying households with capital gains in 1991 contained more than one child. These households had an average income of $87,448 and an average capital gain of $1,178. 
<p>
Another 27 percent of taxpaying households with capital gains contained taxpayers over the age of 65 or blind. These taxpayers had an average income of $43,637 and an average capital gain of $2,151. It is particularly important that households containing children and elderly taxpayers be able to liquidate appreciated assets and realize as much after-tax income as possible if they are to pay for increasingly expensive educational and medical services.
<p>
As Table 1 shows, half of all capital gains were earned by households with incomes from other sources under $100,000, which also accounted for 52 percent of all non-capital gain income. 
<p>
<B>Second</B>, economists who have analyzed the economic effects of balancing the federal budget while simultaneously cutting taxes (including the capital gains tax) have all concluded that these policy changes result in widespread economic benefits through a stronger, more productive economy. One of the nation's most independent and celebrated models of the U.S. economy, the University of Michigan's Quarterly Model, found that balancing the budget with tax cuts produced immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and higher long-term economic activity.<sup>4</sup>  Each of this country's leading private economic consulting firms (DRI/McGraw-Hill, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, and Laurence H. Meyer & Associates) recently predicted that balancing the budget with these tax cuts would lead to a much stronger economy with higher wages and more spendable household income.<sup>5</sup><p>The Heritage Foundation recently used the U.S. Macroeconomic Model developed and maintained by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates to determine the economic impact of the balanced budget plan.<sup>6</sup>  While this analysis found that the entire package of budget and tax cuts should result in generally higher economic activity, it also found that most of the economic benefits of the balanced budget plan disappear without cuts in capital gains taxes.
<p>
A Heritage simulation of the U.S. Macroeconomic Model that contained all of the spending and tax cuts for the period 1996 through 2002, except those for capital gains taxes, would result in consistently lower Gross Domestic Product in each of these seven years when compared with a simulation that included cuts in capital gains taxes. A little more than $80.2 billion in potential GDP is lost over seven years without capital gains tax relief.
<p>
According to the same simulation, in addition to lower GDP, the absence of cuts in capital gains taxes would lead to higher unemployment rates and slower household income growth. 
<p>
Critics of the bill should note that without the stimulus to new business activity provided by the capital gains tax cut, the other changes in tax policy are simply not great enough to offset the economic effects of reductions in the rate of government spending leading to a balanced federal budget.
<p>
<B>Third</B>, reducing the tax rate for capital gains actually would increase tax revenues from taxpayers who own most of the appreciated assets. Experience over the last 25 years with changes in capital gains tax rates strongly indicates that rate decreases produce more declarations of capital gains and more capital gains taxes. Owners of appreciated assets who face high tax rates generally hold on to their assets in anticipation of lower future rates. When the rates come down, the amount of capital gains goes up.
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains (perhaps has high as $7.5 trillion) exist in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>7</sup>  Some economists have estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial economic benefits and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments. Many politicians agree. In an article last year for the <i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William Randolph, the two leading tax economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated the response of taxpayers to rate reductions as being on the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one percent drop in the rate, capital gains realizations would rise by 6 percent.<sup>8</sup><p>Who would pay most of the additional capital gains taxes?  As Table 1 shows, these new government revenues would come principally from taxpayers with incomes above $200,000. If, indeed, the federal government wants to draw more tax revenue from wealthy Americans, lowering the capital gains tax rate is one of the most effective ways possible to attain this objective.
<P>

<b>Technical Assumptions</b>
<p>
The data about average incomes and capital gains declarations contained in this paper come from the IRS's Public Use File for 1991. This file contains about 115,000 composite tax returns that the IRS has constructed to reflect all 114 million returns filed in 1991. When these returns are multiplied by their statistical weights, the resulting number equals the total national number for a particular tax variable, e.g. capital gains declarations.
<p>
The income numbers contained in this paper were constructed by subtracting all capital gains declarations from adjusted gross income. What remains as income after this subtraction are such things as wages, interest and dividend payments, proprietorship and partnership income, and tax refunds from the previous tax year.

<a href="fyi69c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Additional Non-Residential Fixed Investment From A Balanced Budget<br><p>


Congress's balanced budget plan with tax cuts will lead over the next seven years to greater business investment, higher earnings per hour, and faster economic growth than under current law. The following are the findings of an analysis by <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy. According to the model, the balanced budget plan with tax relief would mean:
<p><ul>
<li>An additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $66.2 billion in consumption expenditures over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential fixed investment over the period 1995 through 2002. 
<p>
<li>An additional 103,700 housing starts over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p></ul>
The analysis is important because many critics of the budget plan have expressed the concern that slowing the growth of federal spending to balance the budget in seven years will cause an economic downturn, if not a recession. Many supporters of the plan, on the other hand, claim that a balanced budget will reduce interest rates and spur productive, private-sector investment and economic activity. The Heritage analysis indicates the supporters are correct.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the plan using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates. The analysis is based on the Congressional Budget Resolution, as passed by Congress in May, which forms the overall structure of budget legislation now moving through Congress, and the Senate Finance Committee's description of tax policy changes.1  The Meyer model was used to gauge the general effects that key components of the budget would have on the economy. The Heritage Foundation's simulation of the budget plan strongly indicates that the general trend of economic activity will improve significantly during the "glide path" to a balanced budget as compared with a baseline of continued deficits under current law.
<p>
Laurence H. Meyer & Associates is a nationally recognized economic consulting firm. The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms. Among them:  the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders, and the Ford Motor Company.2 
<p>

<b>The Baseline Projection</b>
<p>
Heritage used projections of economic activity under current budget and tax policy prepared by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates as the economic baseline against which the Congress's budget and tax plan is compared. This baseline forecast (dated August 1995) projects that under current law the federal deficit continuously worsens during the projection period, from a fiscal year 1995 level of $162.1 billion to a fiscal year 2002 level of $257.4 billion. According to the baseline forecast and projection, the average annual growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product associated with these continuing deficits is 2.48 percent.3
<p>

<b>The Balanced Budget Simulation</b>
<p>
To conduct the simulation of the congressional budget plan, Heritage economists adjusted only those elements of the Meyer baseline that deal with federal spending and federal tax policy. The spending levels embodied in the Congressional Balanced Budget Resolution were introduced into the model in such a way that the resulting simulation mirrored the priorities defined in the resolution. For instance, the growth rates for both Medicare transfers and Medicaid grants were limited to levels called for within the budget resolution. Similarly, welfare spending was limited to a growth rate of 3.5 percent per year after 1997. Increases in national defense spending were applied primarily to Department of Defense procurement programs. And spending decreases in government purchases and transfer payments were assumed until a balanced budget was reached in 2002.4
<p>
With respect to changes in tax policy, the model was adjusted to reflect the new average tax rates that individuals and businesses would face if Congress enacted the changes in tax deductions and allowances defined by the Senate Finance Committee in the Chairman's Mark of October 16, 1995. Heritage calculated the changes in average effective federal tax rates that would result from adoption of family tax relief and various changes in the tax treatment of IRAs, health care costs, and estate taxes. These tax policy changes were used to adjust the model's average rate for individuals. Also incorporated were proposed changes in the taxation of individual and corporate capital gains, principally the exclusion of 50 percent of capital gains for individuals, the capping of the corporate tax rate on capital gains at 28 percent, and other major tax policy changes in the Chairman's Mark that would affect businesses.5
<p>
<a href="fyi69t1.gif">Table 1</a> indicates how balancing the federal budget in seven years while cutting taxes would affect the U.S. economy. Critics of balancing the budget and simultaneously cutting taxes argue that these changes will send the economy into a recession. As <a href="fyi69t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows, the simulation not only results in no such recession, but indicates that the economy would generally grow slightly faster with the proposed budget and tax changes than without them. Over the seven-year forecast horizon, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grows by $10.8 billion more with these public policy changes than without them, and at no time during this period does the economy become recessionary (see <a href="fyi69c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).
<p>
There appear to be three principal forces behind this growth in economic activity.
<p>
<b>First, the tax cuts add $32.1 billion above baseline to real household disposable income during the period 1995-2002. </b>
<p>
This growth in the real purchasing power of average Americans explains the higher levels of consumption expenditures under the policy of a balanced budget with tax cuts than under the baseline of continuing deficits and high taxes.
<p>
Total real consumption expenditures are above baseline every year after 1996.
<p>
<b>Second, balancing the budget and cutting taxes leads to greater investment in plant and equipment that, in turn, leads to higher levels of productivity (see <a href="fyi69c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). </b>
<p>
The simulation indicates that households and businesses will face lower interest rates under the balanced budget and tax cut plan than under current budget and tax policy.
<p>
For example, the federal funds rate would fall from 5.8 percent in 1995 to 4.1 percent by 2002 in the simulation, which is 0.5 percentage points lower than the baseline. 
<p>
10-year and 30-year government notes would have significantly lower yields by 2002 than in the baseline of continued deficits. 
<p>
The contract rate for first-time mortgages would drop faster under a balanced budget with tax cuts than in the baseline, to 6.1 percent in 2002 rather than 6.5 percent. This means that the budget and tax plan will save a home borrower of $100,000 about $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage.
<p>
All of these downward interest rate movements when combined with lower taxes support higher growth in household and business purchases of durable goods, homes, and factories.
<p>
Total housing starts would be 2.1 percent higher than in the baseline by 2002, according to the simulation.
<p>
Investment in business machinery would be 2.7 percent higher than in the baseline, with the computers component of business durable equipment outgrowing the baseline by 2.3 percent and all other equipment purchases ending 2.9 percent higher in 2002 than in the baseline.
<p>
The increase in capital investment denotes a movement in savings from cash-based accounts to capital-based assets. In other words, households and businesses are increasing their purchases of more productive and longer-term investments. These investments would have several positive effects. In particular: 
<p>
Real compensation per hour for workers would increase faster (and be the same or higher in every year) than the baseline, and industrial production for businesses would be higher. 
<p>
The simulation shows slightly slower growth in GDP than the baseline in 1996. This temporary slower growth is due to reduced federal government purchases. However, the shift in savings from cash-based accounts to capital-based assets generally supports greater economic growth after 1996. The continued purchases of durable goods and equipment by households and businesses more than offsets reductions in government spending.
<p>
<b>Third, the reduction of federal government spending in the private economy leads not only to a stronger macroeconomy, but to one with less inflation.</b>
<p>
Both the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index would grow more slowly with a balanced budget plan and tax cuts than without them. For example:
<p>
The average growth in the CPI, according to the simulation, would be 1.94 percent per year, while the baseline forecast projects an annual average growth rate of 2.29 percent. 
<p>
It should be noted that the simulation also shows a slightly higher unemployment rate than the baseline in each year after 1995. This slight growth in projected unemployment stems from two factors, one of them a normal feature of economic change and the other based on an assumption about monetary policy.
<p>
First, the reduction in government spending would mean layoffs in the public sector and in firms supplying goods and services to the government. Second, the simulation performed by Heritage assumes that the Federal Reserve System makes no change in the reserve requirements of its member banks and refrains from stimulating the economy by increasing the growth of monetary reserves. This assumption means relatively lower levels of growth in consumption expenditures and employment when compared with a simulation, also performed by Heritage and using the Meyer model, that assumes the Federal Reserve reacts to the slowdown in government spending by easing constraints on banks. It is worth noting that this second simulation (where the Fed stimulates short-term economic activity by expanding the supplies of money and credit) yields unemployment rates that are the same or better than the baseline. The unemployment numbers shown are a worst-case scenario when compared to model simulations which assume a reaction by the central bank.
<p>
This interim analysis of Congress's budget and tax plan may surprise both its supporters and its critics. On the one hand, supporters may have expected the economy to respond to a balanced budget with tax cuts more immediately than the analysis shows. But the plan's supporters should take note that, while these changes over the seven-year forecast period are significant, the major impact of these policy changes occurs not immediately, but steadily -- over the period in which the budget is balanced and thereafter. Further, the tax changes, while significant, are only a small adjustment in today's code. Congress would need to enact major reforms of the code to spur the level of capital formation and growth that proponents of, say, a flat tax predict. If Congress were to make pro-growth reforms in federal tax policy (such as enacting a flat tax), the future pattern of the economy likely would improve much more than it would as the result of the relatively modest tax changes now being considered. 
<p>
Critics of the balanced budget plan, on the other hand, should recognize that the plan generally supports their objective of economic growth at lower interest rates and lower inflation.
<p>
<b>Technical Notes</b>
<p>
The following policy assumptions were accounted for:
<ul><p>
<li>Military spending--90% of the spending increases over the next seven years was applied to the procurement account. The other 10% was applied to Department of Defense civilian employment increases. Zero percent real growth was assumed in 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Agriculture--The $13.4 billion savings from decreased agriculture subsidies called for in the budget resolution was spread over seven years in the following distribution:  1996 ($0.6), 1997 ($1), 1998 ($1.6), 1999 and 2000 ($2), 2001 ($2.6), 2002 ($3.6). A reduction of $3.6 billion was assumed in 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Medicare--Reductions in the rate of growth for Medicare follow those in the budget resolution. A growth rate of 7.63 percent was assumed for 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Welfare--Cash aid welfare spending growth rates were capped at 3.5 percent.
<p>
<li>Foreign aid--Transfer payments to foreigners were decreased according to the reductions called for in the budget resolution for account number 150 (international affairs).
<p>
<li>Medicaid--The growth rate in Medicaid was held to the levels called for in the budget reconciliation:  7.2 percent in 1996, 6.8 in 1997, and 4 percent thereafter.
<p>
<li>Civilian and military compensation per person was held constant after 1998.
<p>
<li>Non-defense federal civilian employment was decreased by 20 percent, spread evenly between 1996 and 2000. 
<p>
<li>All other spending-- for government purchases and transfer payments -- was reduced in the same proportion called for in the budget resolution until balance was reached in 2002.
<p>
<li>Capital gains taxes--A 50 percent exemption of capital gains was assumed for taxation purposes through 2004.
<p>
<li>Family tax relief--Federal receipts from individual income taxes were reduced according to the yearly levels in the Joint Tax Committee's score of the Senate's tax package.
</ul><p>
Other provisions of the Senate tax relief package were accounted for by changing the effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.

<p>
Using a generally accepted and widely regarded model of the U.S. economy, we found that balancing the federal budget between 1996 and 2002 while cutting taxes caused the economy generally to grow more than not balancing the budget and cutting taxes.
<p>
<i>Specifically, according to the simulation, the balanced budget plan with tax relief would mean:</i>
<p><ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product grows by $10.8 billion more than under current law in the year 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $66.2 billion in consumption expenditures over the period 1995 though 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential fixed investment over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>A decrease of 0.4 percent in the conventional mortgage rate.  This means that a balanced budget with tax relief would save a home borrower of $100,000 about $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage.
<P>
<li>The additional construction of 104,000 new family homes over the next seven years.
<p>
<li>The additional sales of 600,000 automobiles over the next seven years worth $10 billion.
<p>
<li>A decrease of 0.7 percent in the growth rate of the Consumer Price Index.
<p></ul>
	The Heritage Foundation used the U.S. economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting company, to reach these conclusions. Laurence H. Meyer & Associates are consultants to many government agencies including the Office of Management & Budget, the Federal Reserve Board, the Department of Labor, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Council of Economic Advisors.
<p>
	Heritage made no changes to the Meyer model except to reset federal spending levels to mirror those contained in the Congressional Budget Resolution of May and to reduce tax rates that capture tax policy changes defined by the Senate Finance Committee.  We explicitly continued the assumption of the Meyer model that the Federal Reserve would not act to stimulate the economy in the face of slower than expected growth.  Had we allowed the model to use the assumption of a more active Federal Reserve, all of the numbers reported below would have been significantly higher.
<p>
Specifically, we assumed:
<p><ul>
<li>Reductions in the rate of growth for Medicare and Medicaid follow those in the budget resolution.
<p>
<li>Cash aid welfare spending growth rates were capped at 3.5 percent.
<P>
<li>Increases in national defense spending were applied primarily to Department of Defense procurement programs.
<p>
<li>All other spending -- for government purchases and transfer payments -- was reduced in the same proportion called for in the budget resolution until balance was reached in 2002.
<p>
<li>A 50 percent exemption of capital gains was assumed through 2004.
<p>
<li>Family tax relief and other provisions of the Senate tax package were accounted for by changing the effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.

<b>"I think I raised [your taxes] too much, too."</b><p>
<blockquote>		--President Clinton, October 17, 1995</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="tax-cut2.gif">Chart 1: Tax Cut Only One-Third of Combined 1990 and 1993 Tax Increases</a><br>
<a href="tax-cut1.gif">Chart 2: Government Will Still Get Too Much Revenue After Tax Cut</a><br>
<p>
President Clinton claims that the $245 billion seven-year tax cut supported by Congress is excessive. But it actually does not come close to eliminating the huge tax increase levied by the last Congress and is dwarfed by the level of tax hikes approved since Ronald Reagan left office. (See <a href="tax-cut2.gif">Chart 1</a>) Consider:
<p><ul>
<li> The increased tax burden caused by the 1990 and 1993 tax bills totals three times more than this year's proposed tax cut. Taxpayers will still be worse off compared with their tax burden in 1989. <p>

<li> This year's tax cut will reduce federal tax collections by less than 2.2 cents on the dollar. And that is the "worst-case" estimate that assumes no revenue feedback from higher growth stimulated by such things as the proposed capital gains tax cut.
<p>
<li> Even with the tax cut, tax revenues are projected to rise from $1.357 trillion this year to $1.820 trillion in 2002, an increase of $463 billion (an average of $66 billion per year).
</ul><p>
	By any objective measure, the Administration's claim that the tax cut is too big cannot be justified. Set in proper context, these figures instead make a persuasive case that this year's tax cut should be considered a first step. Indeed, when lawmakers next year begin considering a flat tax, they should take whatever steps are needed -- including further limits on the growth of federal spending -- to ensure that tax reform is accompanied by tax reduction.
<p>
	<b>Undoing Damage from 1990 and 1993 Tax Hikes.</b> According to Congressional Budget Office figures, the 1990 tax increase was projected to increase revenues by 0.54 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The 1993 tax hike, America's biggest, was projected to raise revenues by a further 0.73 percent of GDP. The tax cut now being discussed, by contrast, is estimated to reduce tax collections by a scant 0.4 percent of GDP. Thus, CBO projections suggest that this comparatively modest tax cut at best will reverse only one-third of the damage inflicted by higher taxes in 1990 and 1993.<P>

	<b>No Revenue Shortfall.</b> As <a href="tax-cut1.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates, the CBO projects that federal tax collections will expand by more than $460 billion if the tax cuts are enacted. These estimates, incidentally, assume that there is no positive effect on the economy from lowering the tax burden. Needless to say, several measures in the proposal, such as reductions in the tax on capital gains, expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts, and partial relief for those subject to the alternative minimum tax, will boost incentives to save and invest and therefore trigger higher wages for American workers. This increase in taxable income will offset some of the projected $245 billion tax cut.
<p>
	Even with the implausible assumption that the economy receives no benefit from lower taxes, the proposed tax cut will have only a tiny effect on revenues. Tax revenues still are projected by the CBO to rise by an average of $66 billion annually between 1995 and 2002. And of the $11.373 trillion in tax revenue the government is projected to collect over that period, the $245 billion tax cut will reduce that amount by less than 2.2 cents for every dollar.
<P>
	<b>The High-Tax Approach Has Failed.</b> The White House claims that lower taxes will be counterproductive. Before criticizing tax cuts, however, the Administration would be well advised to see how the redistributionist goal of higher taxes has backfired.
Tax rates on the "rich" were raised in 1990 and 1993. The result:  As opponents warned, upper-income taxpayers reduced the amount of income they reported.
<P><ul>
<li> The higher taxes from the "rich" from increased income tax rates in 1990 and 1993 were supposed to help boost total income taxes as a proportion of GDP. The result:  Income tax collections actually have fallen from 8.6 percent of GDP in 1989 to 8.2 percent of GDP in 1994.
<p>
<li> Revenues grew by an average of 6.6 percent annually in the "tax-cutting" Reagan years, a rate of growth one-fourth higher than the 5.3 percent annual revenue increases under Presidents Bush and Clinton.
<p>
<li> The budget deficit was less than $155 billion in 1989 and was projected by the Congressional Budget Office in January 1989 to fall every year into the future if Reagan's policies were left untouched. Lawmakers instead imposed large tax hikes in 1990 and 1993. The result:  The deficit this year is $161 billion and now projected by the CBO to rise in future years.
<p>
<li> The tax increases in 1990 and 1993 were intended to spur the economy. The result:  A recession in 1990-1991 was followed by recovery and expansion well below historical averages for job creation and economic growth.
</ul><p>
	In the last five years, taxpayers have been burdened by two major tax increases. These tax hikes have failed to achieve their economic and income redistribution objectives. The result has been lackluster economic growth and persistent budget deficits. To help reverse this failed approach, Congress is preparing what is, in reality, a modest tax cut. The tax relief is only a fraction of the 1990 and 1993 tax increases, and taxpayers will see their tax bills decline by less than 2.2 percent compared to current law. But the proposed changes are at least a welcome step in the right direction of a tax code that would stimulate the economy.

Backgrounder No. 1043<br>

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
Later this month, members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee will begin filling in the details of the $245 billion package of tax relief approved in the FY 1996 budget resolution. In addition to finding the savings needed to balance the federal budget by fiscal 2002, the budget resolution requires an additional $75 billion in savings, which combined with the estimated $170 billion "fiscal dividend" produced by the balanced budget plan, is sufficient to finance a substantial package of tax relief to help families with children and to stimulate economic growth.
<p>
Congress must now determine how to allocate a limited pool of $245 billion in tax relief. The committees should begin this process by using the $354 billion House plan as a menu from which to craft a tax relief package. Because the House plan contains roughly $110 billion more tax relief than is now available under the conference agreement, the committees must use some criteria for narrowing their choices. While each of the tax relief proposals in the House-passed plan addresses particular inequities in the tax code or specific weaknesses in the economy, some of the proposals have additional qualities that should make them top priorities for inclusion in the final package.
<p>
The cornerstones of the House-passed plan, which also should form the cornerstones of the new tax relief package, are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>$500 per child tax credit, 

<li>Reduction of the capital gains tax, and 

<li>An IRA-Plus plan. 
</ul><p>
These tax relief proposals have been the core of the House plan because they provide direct tax relief to American families and they would do most to spur economic growth. The other tax cuts in the House plan are far more targeted in their impact on various taxpayers or far more limited in their impact on the economy. To be sure, these other tax cuts are important, but their inclusion in the final tax cut package will rest on the relative merits of each proposal. 
<p>
In the final analysis, however, the answer involves an important and fundamental decision by Congress about who should control spending -- the government or taxpayers. That is why both tax and spending reductions are needed to effectively move control of spending out of Washington and into the hands of ordinary citizens. By including tax relief in this year's budget, Congress is allowing American taxpayers, rather than the government, to keep and spend more of the money they earn.
<p>
<b>Relief for Families.</b> Most important, American families must share in the savings from reduced government spending. Families also are more likely to support such reductions, for example, if they know they can keep $500 for each dependent child. This is especially true as Congress is considering substantial reforms in welfare. For working families earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year, the $500 per child tax credit (giving a family of four a $1,000 tax cut) will eliminate their entire income tax burden. Indeed, these families would need less government assistance if they did not have to send so much of the money they earn to Washington in taxes. 
<p>
These overtaxed families can also be turned into a powerful constituency for smaller government if Congress directly links the benefits of balancing the budget to family tax relief. The families of 52 million children, or 35 million working families, would be eligible for the $500 per child tax credit. Taking money away from wasteful government programs and placing it in the pockets of working families gives these taxpayers a stake in the budget process and the incentive to stand up to the advocates of big government.
<p>
Overall, the House-passed plan is very "family-friendly," since some 65 percent of all tax relief will go to families or seniors. About 35 percent of the tax relief will benefit the business or investment communities, contributing to economic growth through job creation. Some of the tax relief targeted to "business," such as reductions in estate and gift taxes, also will benefit owners of family businesses and farms. As they craft a new tax relief plan, the House and Senate committees would be wise to maintain the "family-friendly" nature of the House plan by keeping the relative ratio of tax relief targeted to families and to economic growth and businesses.
<p>
Other tax relief proposals contained in the House-passed plan would improve the fairness of the tax system for senior citizens and businesses, too. For instance, seniors will be more likely to accept Medicare reforms if they no longer have to pay today's surtax on their Social Security benefits; and businesses will be more likely to accept losses in corporate welfare programs if they know the tax code will not punish them for capital investments and risk-taking.
<p>
<b>Relieving the Pressure on Spending.</b> Members should also keep in mind that certain tax relief can change the behavior of some taxpaying groups in ways that ultimately reduce federal outlays for specific programs. Two examples in the House-passed plan are the tax credits for adoption and the improved tax treatment of long-term health care expenditures. Studies show that in many states, putting one child in foster care can cost taxpayers $10,000 to $30,000 per year. This cost could be reduced substantially to the extent that the adoption credit encourages more families to adopt foster children. Similarly, Medicaid's nursing home costs are exploding as many seniors are "divesting" themselves of their assets in order to become eligible for this taxpayer financed program. These public costs could be substantially reduced by the improved tax treatment of long-term care insurance and out-of-pocket expenses.
<p>
Members of Congress should understand how different elements of tax relief benefit their states. Many Members opposing tax relief choose to look only at the impact of reduced federal spending on their states or districts. They forget that if Washington does not spend the money, families will have more to buy necessities for their children, seniors will have more to pay for their own medical services, and businesses will have more to invest in their workers. While this private spending is not as politically visible as unveiling a new pork-barrel project, it does far more to improve the lives of citizens back home. 
<p>
The <a href="/heritage/">Heritage Foundation</a> has estimated the benefits of some of these tax relief proposals -- in some cases, as much as $10 billion to $20 billion over seven years -- for each state (see Appendix). Taxpayers do not need more government spending or new social programs to improve their well-being. Shifting the resources from Washington bureaucrats to families, seniors, and businesses should be viewed as a prudent way to reduce future government spending and encourage work saving and investment.
<p>
As Members negotiate over how to allocate the $245 billion in agreed-upon tax relief, they must remember the importance of putting families first. Working families have borne the largest burden for the rampant growth of government spending and stand to feel the greatest pinch as the rate of spending declines. Furthermore, family incomes have been declining since 1989 thanks to large tax increases imposed on them in 1990 and 1993.
<p>

<b>FAMILY TAX RELIEF</b>
<p>
	The House-passed balanced budget plan contains a substantial package of "family-friendly" tax cuts, including a $500 per child tax credit, expanded Individual Retirement Accounts, and tax credits for families who adopt and those caring for elderly relatives. Over seven years, these family tax cut provisions total $184 billion, comprising 50 percent of the overall tax cut plan. Families, especially families with children, will benefit more than any other group of taxpayers from cutting more wasteful government spending. 
<p>

<b>#1) $500 per Child Tax Credit</b>
<p>
The centerpiece of the Republican Contract with America and the centerpiece of the House-passed plan is a $500 per child tax credit benefiting 35 million working families raising some 52 million children. Such tax relief for working families is long overdue. In 1948, the average American family with two children paid only 3 percent of its income to the federal government in taxes. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent. The family income lost in taxes over the past 45 years exceeds the annual mortgage payment on the average family home. Giving the typical family of four a $500 per child tax credit is equivalent to giving them one month's mortgage payment.
<p>
The House plan's $500 per child credit is "non-refundable," meaning the total value of the credit may not exceed a family's income tax bill. But it does provide uniform tax relief to all families with up to $200,000 per year in income, thereby reducing a low-income family's tax burden by a much greater proportion than an upper-income family's. 
<p>
Example:  A $500 per child tax credit would eliminate the entire federal income tax liability for families of four earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year; cut by 50 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $30,000 per year; and cut by 30 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year. Meanwhile, the same credit would reduce the income tax burden of a family earning $100,000 per year by only 6.8 percent and the income tax burden of a family earning $200,000 per year by just 2.6 percent.
<p>
Based on Census Bureau data, Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated that the typical congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for a $500 credit. This means families in the typical district would receive $59 million per year in tax relief. The Appendix shows the amount of family tax relief by state. It is difficult to imagine that any single federal spending project of similar magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the same time. Thus, the political advantages of family tax relief would more than outweigh the political disadvantages of cutting the federal spending needed to pay for it.
<p>

<b>#2) Tax Credit to Reduce the Marriage Penalty</b>
<p>
Under current law, dual-income married couples who file a joint return can end up paying more taxes than two single taxpayers filing individually. The House-passed bill takes a small step toward reducing this "marriage penalty" by giving these working couples a tax credit with a maximum value of $145 per year. The size of this credit would be determined by Treasury Department tax tables comparing the tax liability of a married couple filing jointly with their liability if they filed as unmarried workers. While the size of this tax credit is relatively small, it is a first step toward removing the tax code's bias against marriage and intact families.
<p>

<b>#3) New Individual Retirement Accounts</b>
<p>
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) reduce the tax bias against savings by deferring taxes on income (up to $2,000 per year) placed into these special accounts. However, this income and the interest generated by these savings are taxed when retirees begin to withdraw their money. 
<p>
The House-passed plan offers another way for taxpayers to avoid punishing taxes on retirement savings by creating a new IRA called the "American Dream Savings Account" ("ADS account"). Contributions to this account would be made from post-tax income, but the interest from such savings would not be taxed upon withdrawal if the contributions remain in the account for at least five years and the retiree has reached age  59<over>1/2</under>. This new form of IRA would give workers the incentive to save taxed income today in order to reap tax savings in retirement. That is why the ADS account is sometimes known as a "back-ended" IRA. 
<p>
Initially, contributions to the new ADS account would be limited to $2,000 per taxpayer per year ($4,000 for a married couple), but this amount would be indexed to the rate of inflation in subsequent years. The plan also allows penalty-free withdrawals for a first-time home purchase or to pay certain educational or medical expenses.
<p>
The House-passed plan also modifies current restrictions on the amount married spouses may contribute jointly to an IRA. Under current law, and subject to certain restrictions on workers with other retirement plans, individuals may place up to $2,000 into an IRA. However, spouses filing jointly are allowed to contribute only a combined $2,250 to their IRA, not $2,000 for each spouse. The new ADS account allows this same couple to contribute $2,000 for each spouse for a full $4,000, even if one spouse is not working. This provision would greatly assist the retirement plans of families in which one parent chose to stay home with the children. This change also would encourage lower-income taxpayers to save more for their retirement and rely less on Social Security.
<p>

<b>#4) Tax Credit for Adoption</b>
<p>
The estimated two million families ready to adopt children face huge expenses during the adoption process, but current tax law does not allow them to deduct adoption costs from their tax bill. The House-passed plan makes a substantial commitment to encouraging adoption by giving adoptive families a tax credit of $5,000 to offset such expenses as adoption fees, court costs, attorneys' fees, and other related expenses. This credit is available in full to families earning up to $60,000 per year and gradually phased out for families earning up to $100,000 per year.
<p>
This credit could go a long way toward encouraging families who want to adopt less fortunate children but are prevented from doing so by the enormous cost. By encouraging more adoptions by solid middle-class families, this credit could lead to a long-term reduction in the cost of taxpayer-supported social service and foster care programs at both the federal and state levels. According to the American Public Welfare Association, close to 500,000 children were in the foster care system in 1992. Studies show that taxpayers pay an average of $10,000 per child per year for foster care programs and as much as $30,000 per child per year for more intensive shelter care programs.<sup>1</sup>  And while many couples want to adopt, they often are discouraged by the initial costs of the adoption process, especially if they have only a modest income. Thus, to the extent that the credit encourages additional parents to adopt, reductions in state and federal outlays to maintain these children in foster care or institutions would offset the revenue cost.

<p>
<b>#5) Tax Credit for Dependent Parents</b>
<p>
	The current tax code provides little relief to families who choose to care for an elderly parent or grandparent. The standard personal exemption of $2,500 is available for these families, but, as with the dependent child exemption, the value of the credit is greater for middle- and upper-income families than for modest-income families in the 15 percent income bracket. For example, while the standard deduction of $2,500 allows a family in the 15 percent bracket to lower their income tax by $375, the same deduction allows a family in the 28 percent bracket to lower their tax by $700.
<p>
The House plan offers additional -- and more equitable -- tax relief to families who care for their parents and grandparents in the form of a uniform $500 tax credit. Such a credit could help many families who prefer to care for their elderly relatives at home but cannot afford the expense. To avoid burdening their children and grandchildren with this expense, many seniors are divesting themselves of their wealth in order to become eligible for the long-term program funded by Medicaid. This program, which pays for nursing home care for seniors, is quickly becoming the fastest growing program in the federal budget. The $500 tax credit could help reduce this cost by encouraging more families to take an active role in caring for their elderly relatives.
<p>

<b>TAX RELIEF FOR SENIORS</b>
<p>
The House budget proposal contains provisions that are especially important to many retired or terminally ill Americans with particular financial needs. It repeals the "elderly surtax" provisions of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase, which imposed a high tax rate on income from savings, investments, and pensions.<sup>2</sup>  In addition, it provides tax incentives for the purchase of private long-term care insurance, allows terminally and chronically ill people to receive insurance benefits before their death without an income tax penalty, and increases the amount individuals between age 65 and 69 may continue to earn from employment without losing their Social Security benefits.

<p>
<b>#6) Repeal of the Tax Increase on Social Security Benefits</b>
<p>
	Over four million retired Americans were shocked to discover a severe penalty in their 1994 federal taxes, imposed by the 1993 tax bill on their income from savings for retirement. The penalty imposed by Section 86 of the Internal Revenue Code creates a higher marginal tax rate for all Americans over age 65 who supplemented their Social Security pensions with personal savings and pensions earned during their working years. Withdrawals from IRA savings accounts are particularly hard hit, and these withdrawals are mandatory after age 701/2. Retired people above that age cannot avoid turning over significant portions of their retirement savings to the tax collectors.
<p>
The House plan gradually repeals the 1993 increase in this tax on savings over a five-year period but does not eliminate it entirely. It cuts the maximum tax to 75 percent in 1996, 65 percent in 1997, 60 percent in 1998, 55 percent in 1999, and 50 percent in 2000 and later years. The complete elimination of this highly complex section of the tax code should be a top priority in Congress, since it is a direct attack on responsible individuals' ability to prepare for retirement by saving. House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) has identified this tax as a priority for repeal:  "punishing people who work and save all their life...is not only morally wrong, it is bad social policy."<sup>3</sup><p>All Social Security recipients must fill out a complicated worksheet just to calculate whether they are subject to the higher tax rate, which adds to the complexity of the tax code for these senior citizens. The tax computation also obscures the higher rates, since the method of figuring whether it is due has been made extremely confusing and depends on how much income anyone receives from savings. For most Social Security recipients, the additional complicated paperwork this April 15 was simply bothersome, because their calculations placed them below an exempt threshold. But the higher rates hit hard those taxpayers with retirement income greater than $25,000 ($32,000 for married taxpayers) from private pensions, withdrawals from an IRA or 401(k) savings plan, and dividends or interest from investments. Although incomes below the exemption are not subject to the higher rates, the tax threshold amounts are not indexed for inflation, so in a few years most if not all retired Americans with income from savings will be penalized.
<p>
The elderly surtax has two brackets. The first increases the taxpayer's marginal rate by 50 percent (for example, from 15 to 22.5 percent); the second, by 85 percent (from 28 to 51.8 percent). The second bracket applies to individuals with incomes above $34,000 and married taxpayers above $44,000. As the table on the following page illustrates, for taxpayers in the top income tax bracket of 39.6 percent, the elderly surtax imposes an effective marginal tax rate of 73 percent on any funds they withdraw from IRA savings. These high rates begin to wipe out mandatory IRA withdrawals at age 701/2.
<p>
The low savings rate for retirement among middle-income Americans in the prime of life is one of the most serious policy concerns in Congress today. Yet the surtax on savings for Social Security recipients, of which many seniors often are unaware until they start withdrawing their IRA savings, makes a mockery of the incentives to save. It is a cruel joke because the tax rates are higher, not lower as most savers were promised. Repealing this vicious surtax on the savings of elderly Americans is not just good social policy. It is the right thing to do.
<p>

<b>#7) Modify the Social Security Earnings Test	</b>
<p>
	Approximately two million Americans over age 65 supplement their Social Security benefits with income earned through part-time jobs. For many elderly people, retirement is out of the question because it would mean economic hardship. They simply have inadequate savings or no private pension benefits. The Social Security law has cut benefits severely for retirees who continue to work and earn more than $11,280. This limitation applies to those between the ages of 65 and 70 and is indexed annually for inflation. Those who earn more lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 of wages earned. The House of Representatives budget proposal would raise the annual earnings limit to $30,000. The increases would be phased in over five years:  from $15,000 in 1996 to $19,000 in 1997; $23,000 in 1998; $27,000 in 1999; and $30,000 in the year 2000. The earnings limit thereafter would be indexed for inflation.
<p>
The earnings limit requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to recalculate pension benefits and attempt to collect amounts paid to retired people who earned more than the law permits. Retirees must forecast their year's earnings in advance and have their Social Security cut, but if their estimated income is too low, they must fill out application forms to recover their lost benefits. The SSA estimates that 60 percent of all overpayments and 45 percent of all underpayments occur because of the earnings limit. This limit costs over $200 million per year in administrative paperwork, most of which would be saved by expanding the earnings limit as proposed in the House budget resolution.
<p>
In the next few decades, the generation approaching retirement generally will have inadequate savings to enjoy leisure without supplemental earnings. In addition, the lower birthrate in the past two decades will have tightened the labor market, so many elderly workers may find their experience and skills still very much in demand. The U.S. economy will enjoy higher economic growth and semi-retired workers will have a more adequate standard of living with the proposed modification in the Social Security earnings test.
<P>

<b>#8) Provide an Incentive for Private Long-Term Care</b>
<p>
	As the health of elderly Americans improves and more people live to very old age, the financial burden of providing care for this increasingly dependent group has become a challenge for public policy. Increasingly, middle-class Americans discover later in life that despite the prudent decisions they have made to cover their income and health care needs during retirement, they face unanticipated and staggering costs for nursing home care. Many see the savings and other assets assembled during their working lives disappear rapidly when they become chronically sick or frail and need institutional care. One response to this threat has been for elderly Americans to transfer assets to their children so that they can qualify for nursing home assistance under the Medicaid program. States and the federal government are concerned about the rising cost of the long-term portion of Medicaid, partly because of this "gaming" of Medicaid. 
<p>
In an attempt to control future budget outlays for health and welfare benefits, people should be given effective incentives to provide for their own long-term care. The House budget resolution provides several new tax provisions to encourage individuals and employers to provide long-term care insurance. Starting in 1996, long-term care insurance generally would be treated the same as accident and health insurance, and employers would be allowed to provide their employees with tax-free long-term care insurance just as they now often provide medical benefits. Individuals would be allowed to exchange existing life insurance policies or annuity contracts for long-term care policies without incurring any income tax liability. They also would be permitted to withdraw funds from IRAs and other tax-sheltered retirement plans to purchase long-term care insurance.
<p>
Although medical expenses are deductible from federal taxes when they exceed a certain percentage of income, long-term care expenses today generally are not tax-deductible. Under the House budget resolution, eligible long-term care premiums and expenses for qualified long-term care services would be treated the same as other medical expenses, and benefits received under a long-term care insurance policy would be tax-free (up to $200 per day).
<p>
Placing long-term care benefits on the same basis as health care and financing them under tax provisions similar to those for medical insurance makes good sense, especially in view of the growing elderly population. Delaying the incentives to prepare for an easily foreseen future problem would be shortsighted, making more likely even heavier state and federal spending on nursing home care.
<p>

<b>#9) Accelerated Payment of Life Insurance Benefits for the Terminally Ill</b>
<p>
	Under current law, life insurance benefits are not taxed, but insured individuals and their families have no way to obtain benefits prior to death without a severe income tax liability -- even though many insurance companies are willing to offer such "accelerated benefits."  In the case of lingering illness with no prospect of recovery, an elderly person could exhaust all his savings and apply for Medicaid, unable to claim potentially huge life insurance benefits. And if the elderly person no longer has the means to make premium payments, his policies may be allowed to lapse.
<p>
The House budget includes a provision to facilitate the practice by which some insurance providers pay benefits prior to death if the insured person is terminally or chronically ill. Such payments would be excluded from a taxpayer's gross income, just as payments to a surviving beneficiary now are. In addition, similar tax-exempt treatment is allowed for amounts received from the sale or assignment of a life insurance contract to a qualified settlement provider. In these cases, the insured would receive a payment comparable to the value of insurance benefits, and the settlement provider eventually would collect the insurance. As in the case of long-term care benefits, the tax-exempt amount for someone who is chronically but not terminally ill would be subject to the $200 per day exclusion limit.
<p>
The tragedy of terminal illness and the financial burden of chronic illness ought to be sufficient misery for anyone, but the federal tax code adds a degree of bureaucratic hostility. Life insurance is offered with benefits payable under these circumstances, and older policies can be sold or converted to obtain benefits before death. The income tax code should be made more consistent with this humane and increasingly common practice.

<p>
<b>TAX RELIEF TO PROMOTE JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH</b>
<p>
	In addition to family tax relief provisions, the House-passed budget resolution includes a number of reforms designed to reduce the tax burden on savings and investment. Included in this category are:
<p>
<b>#10) Reduction in Capital Gains Tax</b>
<p>
	The U.S. tax code unfairly and unwisely punishes capital investment by taxing investment income more than once:  twice through the corporate and individual income taxes and again by taxing capital gains. The current maximum tax rate on capital gains is 28 percent, and these gains are not indexed to the inflation rate. By contrast, most of America's major economic competitors, such as Japan or Germany, exempt capital gains from taxation entirely or tax them at a greatly reduced rate while often indexing the basis of the gains to inflation.
<p>
The House bill lessens this penalty in two ways. First, it lowers the maximum capital gains rate to slightly below 20 percent. Second, it permits individuals to index the value of assets to ensure that they are not being taxed on purely inflationary gains. This rewards new investment and risk-taking. As the Appendix illustrates, this provision will reduce the tax burden on investment by an estimated $63.2 billion between 1995 and 2002.<sup>4</sup>  It is a positive, albeit limited, step toward the goal of eliminating capital gains taxes.<p><b>#11) Neutral Cost Recovery </b><p>Under current law, businesses must write off capital investments from their tax liability over a number of years. This is different from all other business expenses that can be deducted in the year of purchase, or "fully expensed."  However, the value of a long-term write-off is less than the original cost of the investment because the amounts deducted in later years lose their value.
<p>
The House plan corrects these penalties in the tax code by indexing the depreciation schedules for business investments to inflation and the time value of money. The House bill adjusts depreciation schedules (which determine how fast businesses can deduct the cost of new investments) to protect investors from inflation and otherwise remove biases against investment, particularly for long-term projects. The provision is designed to approximate the ideal tax policy of immediate expensing of capital investment (as found in the flat tax). By correcting this flaw in the tax code, Congress would help encourage businesses to invest more heavily in America's future economic growth.

<p>
<b>#12) Alternative Minimum Tax </b>
<p>
	 The House bill repeals the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax and modifies the individual AMT. These provisions impose some of the heaviest compliance costs and raise limited revenues. Combined with the Neutral Cost Recovery provision, AMT relief would ease the tax burden on American business by about $42 billion over seven years (see Appendix for state totals).
<p>

<b>#13) Expensing for Small Business</b>
<p>
In addition to neutral cost recovery, the House bill increases the amount of investment which can be immediately expensed. Along with other modest reforms, small business will realize $11.4 billion of tax relief (see Appendix for state totals).
<p>
The House tax provisions are a positive first step on the road to pro-growth tax reform. Adoption would boost incentives to save and invest, thereby ensuring faster growth for the economy and higher incomes for American workers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The dilemma facing the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee is how to allocate among families, businesses, and seniors the $245 billion in tax relief provided in the fiscal 1996 budget resolution. The priorities established in the $354 billion House-passed tax relief package are the place to start. 	 Family tax relief, capital gains cuts, and expanded IRAs should be the centerpiece of the new package, as they were for the House-passed plan, because of their widespread benefits to taxpayers and the economy. In particular, the $500 per child tax credit will benefit some 35 million working families, more taxpayers than any other measure. Further, the halving of the capital gains tax and the expansion of IRAs will generate more investment and savings than any of the more targeted measures in the House plan. And as Members add other elements to the new plan, they should also keep in mind the impact that certain tax relief proposals may have on federal outlays. Tax relief that returns money to Americans, and gives them an incentive to make provision for such things as nursing home care for their parents or themselves, also can reduce the cost of federal and state programs.

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.

<b><a name="Economic Benefits">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.  
<p>

<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.  
<p>	  
When capital income, which would not be subject to personal income tax,  
is considered along with wage

<Font Size="2"><b>Less progressive.</b>  One potential criticism of the flat tax is that high-income groups appear to pay a lower percentage of their personal income in taxes than middle-income groups.  This occurs because higher-income groups receive a greater share of their earnings from capital income, which is exempt under the flat tax.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>
<center> 
<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government
<p>

<hr width="50%">
<Font Size="2"><b>More proportional.</b>  When income is defined comprehensively to include business income, taxes on higher-income groups remain remarkably proportional.  That's because the flat tax appears to shift some of the overall tax burden to businesses, whose taxes are borne disproportionately by (higher-income) business owners.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Possibility Awaits">A GREATER POSSIBILITY AWAITS</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

<h3><a name="Addendum">Taking on the Mortgage-Interest Deduction</a></h3>
<hr width="60%">

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
If the flat tax is to gain the support of the public, its advocates will have to confront defenders of existing 
deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<i>"Any sales tax will inevitably become a<br>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
One of the most refreshing feelings in the new Washington is the growing  
sense that our current tax system is not long for this world.  
<p>	 
Only days after the November election, Congressman Bill Archer, the  
chairman of the House tax-writing committee, boldly declared his desire  
to "tear out the income tax by its roots." House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole have since formed a commission   
to consider entirely new alternatives. Presidential candidates Phil Gramm,  
Richard Lugar, and Arlen Specter want to scrap the system. A half dozen  
congressional panels are holding hearings on the subject. Even  
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has  
floated a major rewrite (albeit without details).   
<p> 
The question is no longer whether America will get rid of its burdensome  
tax system; the question is, what new system should we replace it with? It  
is a question that will likely dominate our politics through the next  
election.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="The Contenders">THE CONTENDERS</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
There are three main contenders: One is a plan advanced by Senators  
Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici. They were among the earliest to call  
attention to the most economically lunatic feature of the current tax code  
-- the highly destructive double taxation of savings -- and develop a   
way to fix it. Called the "USA Tax," their proposal, while fairly  
complicated, defers taxation on income that is saved, while taxing income  
that is used for consumption. It is a sincere and innovative effort to  
encourage the savings necessary for continued economic growth.  
<p>	 
The second contender, which I strongly favor, is the flat tax. Designed to  
make the tax system as neutral and simple as possible, the flat tax would  
sweep away all loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, and replace them   
with a single generous personal allowance. All other income would be  
taxed at one low rate of 17 percent. As the plan's authors, economists  
Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, have pointed out, a flat tax would  
allow Americans to figure their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.  
The use of the tax code by would-be social engineers would end. Like the  
USA Tax, the flat tax would also end the double taxation of saving.  
<p>	 
While support for the flat tax is soaring -- almost 60 percent of  
Americans appear to favor a version of it, if polls are to be believed -- the  
Nunn-Domenici plan may have been overtaken by events. Conceived at a  
time when it appeared to many that the redistributionist Democratic Party  
would control Congress indefinitely, the plan contains sharply  
progressive tax rates that would kick in at surprisingly low income levels.  
It addresses the disincentive to save quite well, but it may make the other  
problems in the code, high rates and complexity, even worse than the  
current system. With the new politics in Washington and across the  
country, superior alternatives are now clearly within political reach.  
<p>	 
Then there's choice number three: the national sales tax. This is a  
sweeping plan to wipe away the current system and replace it with an  
unprecedented federal tax on retail purchases. Although it's not as widely  
discussed as the flat tax, it has substantial support among many far- 
thinking conservatives, including Archer and Lugar. Indeed, there are   
few conservative hearts that could not be at least a little warmed by its  
central promise to end the income tax altogether.   
<p>	 
This last choice demands serious examination at the moment. Although  
well-intentioned, the sales-tax option has several serious flaws. Before  
getting into that, though, we must remember that supporters of all these  
plans are allies in a fight to end America's single greatest impediment to  
achieving its possibilities: the IRS code, circa 1995.  
<p>	 
Any American tax system should meet three basic criteria. It should be  
fair, simple, and pro-growth. The current system fails miserably on all  
three counts.   
<p>	 
Is it simple? Not by a long shot. In 1990, American workers and  
businesses spent 5.4 billion hours preparing their taxes for the  
government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and  
van manufactured in the United States each year. After seven decades of  
amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes, and extensions, the code  
has become an incoherent mess. The IRS now sends out eight billion  
pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would  
stretch 28 times around the circumference of the earth.  
<p>	 
Is it fair? Hardly. The tax system is as much an exercise in social  
engineering as it is a way of raising government revenue efficiently.  
Through its exemptions and loopholes, the government tries to guide the  
economic decisions of free Americans in the misguided belief that the   
government knows best. Among other things, the code tells us that it is  
better to invest in a municipal sewer system than the next Microsoft, that  
buying rather than renting a home is a better choice for everyone  
everywhere, that purchasing air compressors is better than buying  
computer software. Government has neither the competence nor the right  
to make those decisions for us. The pretense that "government knows   
best" is an insult to our citizens.  
<p>	 
Is it pro-growth? As written, the tax code actually punishes savings and  
investment, by placing double or even triple tax burdens on capital. This  
lowers wages, destroys jobs, and depresses the living standards of all  
Americans. At the same time, it burdens American workers with  
punishingly high tax rates and overall tax burdens. With state and local   
taxes and other federal taxes, Americans now pay more in taxes than they  
spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined.  
<p>	 
All who have worked to end this system, no matter what plan they  
currently favor, should be welcomed as members of the tax-reform  
movement.   
<p>	 
Now for a closer look at option number three. What follows is my  
assessment of the major arguments advanced in favor of the national sales  
tax:  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax is not an income tax.</b> The case for a sales tax begins with one  
highly appealing applause line. It will allow us, supporters argue, to  
eliminate the income tax altogether, possibly even repealing the 16th  
Amendment, which authorized it and made Big Government possible in   
the first place.   
<p>	 
Even if that goal were politically feasible -- and I don't think it is -- the  
exchange would come at a high price. We would give up the income tax  
for a more intrusive and pervasive tax system.  
<p>	 
The reason is simple. If the government sets out to collect a new tax at  
the cash register, it will soon have no choice but to extend that tax  
beyond the retailer to every level of production, as it desperately tries to  
stop inevitable and massive tax evasion. Any sales tax will become a  
complex, pervasive, multi-rate, value-added tax. We will soon be living   
under a VAT -- possibly the most insidious tax scheme ever devised.  
<p>	 
Sales-tax backers often oppose a VAT. But that's what they'll get. To  
generate sufficient revenue by taxing goods only at the retail level, the  
government would need to impose a sales tax of at least 20 percent,  
which means that consumers would suddenly find that everything they  
buy appears to be 20 percent more expensive. But people will not pay  
such a high tax. They will either find ways to label their consumer goods  
tax-exempt wholesale items, they will purchase goods in a cash black  
market, or they will evade it some other way. A sales tax, in other words,  
will be immediately undermined by a silent tax revolt, and the  
government -- following the pattern of European countries -- will respond  
by imposing a VAT.  
<p>	 
A VAT is assessed at each stage of production and is much easier to  
collect and enforce for a host of reasons. You can hear the bureaucratic  
lament in a 1993 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  
and Development, which noted: "Governments have gone on record as  
saying that an RST [retail sales tax] of more than 10 percent to 12 percent  
is too fragile to tax evasion possibilities, and it is probably not entirely  
accidental that in OECD counties, VAT rates are nearly always above 12  
percent and that, except in Canada and Iceland, RST rates have always  
been well below 12 percent."   
<p>	 
These unhappy governments were speaking from sad experience. In  
1967, 21 developed countries had retail, wholesale, manufacturer, or  
multi-stage sales taxes. Today, 20 out of 21 of these sales taxes have  
become value-added taxes. Every developed country except Australia  
that has had a sales tax now has a VAT. (Even Canada and Iceland,   
mentioned as exceptions when the OECD report was written, have since  
replaced their retail-tax-only systems with VATs.)  
<p>	 
Whether or not the sales tax evolves into a VAT, the government would  
become intimately involved in almost every economic transaction  
between consenting adults. The simplest exchange, from a vegetable  
farmer selling his produce to the corner grocer selling a loaf of bread,  
would be under the shadow of a government tax collector taking his cut.  
In fact, every businessperson in America would become a tax collector  
for the government.  
<p>	 
"But businesses already collect taxes for the government," sales-tax  
supporters counter. There's a big difference. Today, businesses collect a  
relatively small share of the income tax, since three quarters of the  
income in the economy is labor income, paid by individuals. But under a  
sales tax, there is no direct tax on individuals, so businesses will be  
responsible for collecting several times what they collect today. That  
means IRS scrutiny of American businesses could be expected to rise  
proportionately. Since the 10-12 million businesses in America have  
fewer rights under law than individuals, we can expect IRS abuses to rise   
exponentially as well.  
<p>	 
It would be an administrative mess. A national sales tax may well exempt  
many basic necessities from tax --beginning with food and clothing.  
This would lead to bitter disputes over the difference between food and  
candy, between real clothes and costume accessories. Congress and   
the courts would likely find themselves debating the nutritional value of  
Twinkies, the body coverage of sportswear, and much else, just as state  
governments do today, but on a larger scale.  
<p>	 
Worse, the federal sales tax and the dozens of different state sales taxes --  
aside from having different tax rates -- would likely exempt different  
items. That means a small businessperson would need to look up the  
correct state sales-tax rate, apply the federal rate, subtract the state tax  
rate from items exempted only by the state, or subtract only the federal  
rate from items federal-only exempted. Then he would need to do  
separate calculations for each of the states in which he does business.  
(And he would need to catch any mistakes before the tax enforcer  
appears.)  
<p>	 
The likely consequence would be a slowdown in business activity -- and  
a loss of jobs and drop in wages for millions of American workers.   
<p>	 
<b>We could eliminate the IRS.</b> Ignoring or dismissing this inevitable  
tendency for a sales tax to become an all-pervasive VAT -- with a huge  
accompanying bureaucracy -- some sales-tax advocates nevertheless  
argue that the sales tax would allow us to eliminate the IRS altogether.  
<p>	 
The argument is presented with an interesting federalist twist. The states,  
they say, could collect the new federal sales tax through their existing  
sales-tax systems. The federal government, then, could do without its  
own revenue collection agency. We could bring about the ultimate   
devolution of federal authority.  
<p>	 
One immediate problem, however, is that five states do not have a sales  
tax and would not take kindly to enforcing one for Washington. Even  
those that do would consider the costs of collecting a huge federal sales  
tax (the main source of federal revenue) an unbearable federal   
mandate.  
<p>
The enforcement costs for current sales taxes, currently about 5 percent,  
are manageable. However, if you add a 20 percent federal sales tax on top  
of that, the compliance problems grow exponentially. It makes little   
sense for a state government to pay the enforcement costs for a 25  
percent tax when it only gets one fifth of the revenue. Many states would  
simply eliminate their sales taxes.  
<p>	 
But the point is purely academic. For reasons dating back to the unhappy  
years of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government will never  
rely on state governments for its prime source of revenue. It will not  
happen.  
<p>	 
In truth, a sales tax would not eliminate any federal agency. It will  
actually allow a huge increase in the size of the federal government by  
allowing politicians to raise taxes with relative impunity. Why? Because  
sales taxes are hidden from the taxpayers, concealed in the price of the  
goods they buy.  
<p>	 
Try this experiment. Stand outside a grocery store and ask shoppers as  
they leave how much they just paid in sales tax. You'll find that virtually  
no one knows. Can you guess how much you paid in sales tax last month,  
or last year? The problem is, if people don't appreciate how much they  
pay in taxes, it is a lot easier for politicians to raise them.  
<p>	 
<b>Individuals would no longer need to file tax forms with the government.</b>
Since people would pay their taxes whenever they purchase an item,  
some sales-tax advocates argue, the government will never need to know  
a taxpayer's name. There would be no filing of any tax papers at all by an   
individual.  
<p>	 
That's not quite right. Under almost any sales-tax plan, individuals would  
still file with the government -- but for entirely different reasons than  
they do today.  
<p>	 
It's almost certain that one way or another, any federal sales tax would  
need to exempt certain basic necessities in order to make it progressive.  
One way to do this, as I've mentioned above, would be to order retailers  
not to charge tax on food and clothing and whatever else the government   
selects.   
<p>	 
But exempting a handful of items isn't enough. Absent a generous rebate,  
most Americans would face a stiff tax increase under a sales tax. That's  
why most sales-tax proposals provide for a rebate. The truth is, the   
overwhelming majority of Americans would still need to file with the IRS  
to claim their rebate (or else face a substantial tax increase).   
<p>	 
Some have suggested the IRS could simply send out checks to every  
American by Social Security number, obviating the need for taxpayers to  
file with the IRS. This is a fantasy. It wouldn't be long before there were  
more Social Security numbers than citizens. Whether or not Americans   
file directly with the IRS, the potential for fraud is staggering. Even under  
the current Earned Income Tax Credit program, fraud levels are as high  
as 30 to 40 percent. How much fraud would there be if the federal  
government were cutting thousand-dollar checks to every American?  
<p>	  
Of even greater concern is the political dynamic that would develop once  
we couple a hidden sales tax with a highly visible tax rebate. Americans  
would be quietly nickel-and-dimed to death by a sales tax they may  
hardly notice, but every year a very noticeable and generous check would  
arrive from Washington like manna from heaven. Government, and even  
the tax bureaucracy, might become highly popular after all. And in my  
judgment, if there could be anything worse then people hating the IRS, it  
would be for people to love the IRS.	  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will tax the underground economy.</b> The notion here is that a  
sales tax will more effectively tax illicit trade in both legal and illegal  
goods and services than any income tax. If true, this would bring in tens  
of billions of dollars in revenue to the government as we collect revenue   
from people who are currently outside the system.  
<p>	 
The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration.  
Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form, the argument runs,  
maybe we could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax.  
The government may have no record that he exists, but when he uses his  
blood money to buy a sports car, the government will collect tax from  
him.  
<p>	 
That sounds compelling at first, but if we think it through, it doesn't hold  
together. Look at it this way: Both systems will equally fail to tax the  
drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in  
either one. If there's an income tax in place, he won't report his income. If  
there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers. Either  
way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.  
<p>	 
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer who  
makes $50,000 in sales to his customers every year and then turns around  
and spends it. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of  
the dealer and his customers, while under a sales tax we wish to tax all of  
their purchases.  
<p>	 
Under the income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumers  
(assuming they are law-abiding citizens besides their drug use), but we  
can't tax the income of the drug dealer. Thus we lose $50,000 from the  
tax base. Under the sales tax, we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, but  
we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumers. Loss to the tax   
base: $50,000.  
<p>	 
It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade  
because the amount people spend on drugs must equal the income of the  
drug dealer. And since the drug dealer will not report sales or income tax,  
neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.   
<p>	 
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods  
and services as well -- which, of course, is much larger. The proverbial  
plumber who doesn't report his house-call income today would not report  
it for sales-tax purposes either. At best, it will be a wash.  
<p> 	 
Actually, economic reasoning aside, the whole "underground economy"  
argument for a sales tax is flawed. It's obvious that if we try to impose a  
national sales tax of 20 percent or more on the public, the underground  
economy will explode. The "contraband" involved, though, will not be  
just crack cocaine, but virtually any sort of consumer good. That's   
exactly what happened in Canada when the government imposed its  
goods-and-services tax. The tax raised much less than projected.  
Coincidentally, the Canadian Treasury soon noticed a dramatic increase  
in the amount of real currency flowing through the economy. Why were  
Canadians suddenly using so much cash? Guess.  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will reduce the trade deficit.</b> Supporters say that a sales tax  
will increase U.S. competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing  
exports. As tax-policy people put it, a sales tax is "border adjustable."  
Since exports aren't sold in the U.S., they would escape a domestic sales  
tax; since foreign imports are sold here, they will get hit. This way,  
American firms receive a significant tax advantage over foreign firms,  
and that will favorably alter our trade balance.  
<p> 
There are very few economists who hold this view, however. An  
immutable law of economics holds that trade surpluses and deficits are  
linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When savings are low,  
the trade deficit must be high, but if we substituted a tax on imports for  
some other tax, it will not affect the amount Americans save. That means   
the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same, as a  
basic principle of economics.  
<p>	 
Economists might explain it this way (simplifying, of course): If there is  
more investment occurring in our economy than can be financed by our  
savings, then foreign investors must be accounting for the difference. In  
effect, they are taking the money we pay them for their cars and VCRs  
and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment  
capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade  
deficit."   
<p>	 
The only way to change the trade deficit, then, is to change our savings  
rate. If we increase our savings relative to our domestic investment, we  
will have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as  
we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more   
investing at home.  
<p>	 
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods -- including slapping  
them with a sales tax -- will have no effect on the amount of money  
Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own  
bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.  
<p>	 
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because  
of the new tax advantage. But since our savings will remain the same, the  
dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more   
expensive, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored --  
along with the original trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.  
<p>	 
Even if a border adjustment were to work as its proponents claim, it  
would still be a bad idea. It would make the goods Americans buy --  
whether produced here in America or abroad -- more expensive, while  
foreigners could purchase American-made goods more cheaply. It's hard  
to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners  
do to purchase American products.  
<p>	 
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in The Wealth of Nations. Smith  
reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production;  
and the interest of the producer bought to be attended to, only so far as it  
may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  
<p>	 
In a border-adjustable system, however, to borrow from Smith again, "the  
interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the  
producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as  
the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Tragic Irony">A TRAGIC IRONY</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
All of the above assumes, of course, that we really could replace the  
income-tax system with a national sales tax. But could we? The roots of  
the income tax go back to the 16th Amendment, passed in 1916 to  
authorize the government to levy a tax on individual incomes. In my  
view, repealing the amendment and ending the income tax for good   
is, politically, not in the cards. Conservatives in Congress have tried for  
years to pass a balanced-budget amendment without success. I believe we  
will eventually succeed, but in the midst of that grueling fight, I believe  
the notion of getting 290 members of the House, 67 members of the  
Senate, and three quarters of the states to repeal the 16th Amendment is a   
dream.  
<p>	 
And that is perhaps the best argument against the sales tax. If we try to  
exchange an income tax for a sales tax, we could easily end up with both.  
It would be a tragic irony if conservatives who favor a smaller  
government unwittingly provide the liberals with a comprehensive new  
taxing authority without eliminating the old one.  
<p>

<b><a name="Flat-Tax">THE FLAT-TAX OPTION</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
We must not lose sight of the commendable motives behind the sales tax.  
Its supporters want a tax code that does not interfere with economic  
decisionmaking, minimizes the paperwork burdens on the taxpayers,  
limits the size of the federal government, avoids excessive taxes on  
savings and investment, and is straightforward and fair.  
<p>	 
For all the above reasons, however, the sales tax is not likely to achieve  
those goals. The flat tax, however, will do so. By placing a single tax rate  
on all income, it will not distort economic decisions. Citizens will be free  
to spend and invest their money as they see fit without taking tax  
considerations into account. The paperwork burden, for most taxpayers,  
will be reduced to filling out a postcard-sized tax return. Americans will  
get an honest bill and know how much their government costs them.  
Savings and investment income will be taxed, but only once. The  
punitive double taxation of savings in the current code will be gone. The  
flat tax meets the tax-reform criteria -- it is simple, fair, and pro-growth.

<H2> June/July Insider -- Flat Tax Fever </H2>
<HR>
<P>Although
it was a largely unknown academic concept just one year ago, the
flat tax today is one of the most talked about policy reforms
in Washington, in large part due to the efforts of House Majority
Leader Richard Armey of Texas. It now looks increasingly possible
that the current income tax system will be junked in favor of
this simple, fair, pro-growth plan. The present system suffers
from three major problems, each of which would be solved by the
flat tax:<P>
<ul>
<li>Problem #1: High tax rates that discourage work, savings,
and investment.Flat Tax Solution: The Armey flat tax replaces
the current discriminatory system of tax rates with a simple,
low rate that treats all taxpayers equally.<P>
<li>Problem #2: Needless
complexity that imposes $200 billion of compliance costs.Flat
Tax Solution: The Armey flat tax allows all taxpayers to fill
out their taxes on a postcardsized form.<P>
<li>Problem #3: Multiple taxation
of capital income that penalizes economic growth.Flat Tax Solution:
Not only are all individuals treated equally, so is all income.
No longer would some income escape taxation while other types
of income are subject to as many as four levels of taxation.
</ul><P>
The
flat tax solves all these problems by creating a tax system that
treats all citizens equally, rewards productive behavior, and
gets the government out of the business of using tax law to micromanage
the economy. The key benefits of the flat tax are:
<ul>
<li>Faster economic
growth: By reducing tax penalties against savings and investment,
a flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment.
If enactment of a flat tax boosted longterm annual growth by as
little as 0.5 percent, the income of an average family of four
after 10 years would be as much as $5,000 higher than if current
tax laws remained in place.<p>
<li>Instant wealth creation: According to
Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson, adoption of the flat tax would
boost national wealth by some $1 trillion. All incomeproducing
assets would rise in value since the flat tax would increase the
aftertax stream of income they generate.<p>
<li>Simplicity: One business
in 1992 had a tax return 21,000 pages long requiring 30 volumes.
Individual taxpayers are slightly better off, but the system still
imposes needless costs. Under a flat tax, all taxpayers, from
General Motors to John Doe, would be able to fill out their tax
return on a postcardsized form. Current compliance costs would
drop by tens of billions of dollars. <p>
<li>Fairness:  A flat tax would
treat people equally. A very wealthy taxpayer with 1,000 times
the income of another taxpayer would pay 1,000 times more in taxes.
No longer would the tax code penalize success and discriminate
on the basis of income.<p>
<li>End to micromanaging and political favoritism:
 The flat tax gets rid of all deductions, loopholes, credits,
and exemptions. Politicians would lose all ability to pick winners
and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax
code to impose their values on the economy. According to Professor
Alvin Rabushka of Stanford, $100 billion of uneconomical investments
are made for tax purposes, funds that would be used to boost economic
growth under a flat tax.<p>
<li> Increased civil liberties: Under current
laws, those charged with murder have more rights than taxpayers
dealing with the IRS. With a simpler, fairer tax code, however,
infringements on freedoms and privacy would fall dramatically. <P>
<li>Political
feasibility: Unlike the national sales tax or value added tax, the
flat tax does not require either repealing the 16th amendment
or running the risk of creating an entirely new revenue source

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There has been a surge in support for a flat tax in recent months, thanks largely to the efforts of House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-TX). Many Americans see the current tax system as a complicated failure that hinders the nation's growth while allowing the politically well-connected to manipulate the system to get special breaks not available to average workers and businesses. The flat tax, on the other hand, is simple, treats all taxpayers equally, and greatly increases incentives to work, save, and invest.
<p>
<b>WHAT IS A FLAT TAX? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There have been several flat tax proposals over the years. While they differ in important ways, almost invariably they contain three features, each designed to fix a major problem with the current tax code. The major features of a flat tax are:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Single flat rate.</b> All flat tax proposals have a single tax rate that applies to all income subject to tax. Flat taxes also usually include provisions to ensure that all income is taxed just once. The actual tax imposed varies, with rates in some plans as low as 10 percent and in others approaching 20 percent. The low, flat rate solves the problem of high marginal tax rates by reducing penalties against working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions.</b> Flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the code that bestow preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities. Examples of such preferential treatment include deductions for home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes. Eliminating these special provisions solves the problem of complexity, allowing taxpayers to file their tax returns on a postcard-sized form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>No double taxation of savings and investment.</b> Flat tax proposals are designed to reduce or eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by ending the double taxation of income used for savings and investment. Simply stated, these plans often have the equivalent of a "super-IRA," which basically means that taxpayers would be taxed only on the portion of income that is consumed. This reform to ensure that income is not subject to a second level of taxation is needed since today's tax code penalizes future economic growth by discouraging capital formation.
<p>
<b>ADVANTAGES OF A FLAT TAX</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are two principal arguments for a flat tax -- growth and simplicity. Many economists are attracted to the idea because the current tax system, with its high rates and multiple taxation of savings and investment, reduces growth, destroys jobs, and lowers incomes. A flat tax would not eliminate the damaging impact of taxes altogether. But by dramatically lowering rates and ending the tax code's bias against savings and investment, it would boost the economy's performance when compared with the present tax code. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For many Americans, however, the most persuasive feature of a flat tax is its simplicity. The complicated documents and instruction manuals taxpayers struggle to decipher every April would be replaced by a brief set of instructions and the lengthy forms by a simple postcard-sized return. This radical reform appeals to citizens who not only resent the time and expense consumed by their own tax forms, but also suspect that the existing maze of credits, deductions, and exemptions gives a special advantage to those who wield political power and can afford expert tax advisers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If enacted, a flat tax would yield major benefits to the nation, including: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Faster economic growth.</b> A flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment. By increasing incentives to engage in productive economic behavior, it also would boost the economy's long-term growth rate. Even if a flat tax boosted long-term growth by as little as 0.5 percent, the income of the average family of four after ten years would still be as much as $5,000 higher than it would be if current tax laws remained in effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Instant wealth creation.</b> According to Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson, a flat tax would boost national wealth by some $1 trillion.<sup>1</sup>  The reason:  all income-producing assets would rise in value since the flat tax would increase the after-tax stream of income they generate.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Simplicity.</b> All taxpayers, from General Motors to a teenager flipping hamburgers, would be able to fill out their tax return on a postcard-sized form, and compliance costs would drop by tens of billions of dollars. According to a study conducted for the IRS, the current tax code requires taxpayers to devote 5.4 billion hours each year to their tax returns.<sup>2</sup>  Yet even this commitment of time is no guarantee of accuracy. The code is so complex that even tax experts and the Internal Revenue Service often make mistakes.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Fairness.</b> A flat tax would treat people equally. A very wealthy taxpayer with 1,000 times the taxable income of another taxpayer would pay 1,000 times more in taxes. No longer, however, would the tax code penalize success and discriminate against citizens on the basis of income.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>An end to micromanaging and political favoritism.</b> The flat tax gets rid of all deductions, loopholes, credits, and exemptions. Politicians would lose all ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax code to impose their values on the economy. According to Professor Alvin Rabushka of Stanford, co-author of <i>The Flat Tax</i>, $100 billion of uneconomical investments are made for tax purposes.<sup>3</sup>  Under a flat tax, those funds would be used to boost economic growth.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Increased civil liberties.</b> Under current law, people charged with murder have more rights than taxpayers dealing with the Internal Revenue Service. With a simpler, fairer tax code, infringements on freedom and privacy would fall dramatically.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Friendliness toward families.</b> Under the Armey proposal, a family of four would be able to shelter the first $36,800 of income from taxes. Other proposals include similar family allowances.
<p>
<b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b>
<p>
Q:  Should the rich pay more?
<p>
A:  Under a flat tax, the rich do pay more than the poor. A wealthy taxpayer with 100 times more taxable income than his neighbor will pay 100 times more in taxes. A flat tax, however, does not impose special penalties on those who contribute most to the nation's prosperity by subjecting them to punitive and discriminatory tax rates. For those who think the "rich" should pay a higher percentage of their income, the generous family allowance in, say, the Armey bill and others effectively creates a modest level of "progressivity." 
<p>
 Q:  Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?
<p>
A:  It depends on the tax rate, what happens to spending, and how much faster the economy grows under a flat tax. Even taking supply-side effects into consideration, at some point lower rates do translate into less revenue. The size of the personal exemption or family allowance also plays a key role since the decision to protect a certain amount of income generally means the rate on income above that level has to be higher. The Armey proposal probably would cause tax revenues to be lower, particularly in the short term. It also includes spending provisions that would cap the growth of government, however, so the long-term effect would be to reduce government borrowing.
<p>
Q:  What would happen to charitable contributions and housing markets?
<p>
A:  Some worry that the transition from the current system to a new one would create problems for charities and homeowners. History suggests these fears are exaggerated. During the 1980s, the top tax rate was reduced dramatically, falling from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The effect was to reduce the value of itemized deductions by the same amount, yet the value of housing did not drop. Similarly, charitable contributions actually rose sharply during the 1980s. This does not mean itemized deductions have no importance; it simply indicates that the benefits generated by a robust economy more than offset any costs associated with lost deductions. 
<p>
 Q:  Is there not a risk that politicians will raise tax rates in the future?
<p>
A:  As recent events demonstrate -- base broadening in 1986 followed by tax rate increases in 1990 and 1993 -- this is a real danger. But this is not an argument against the flat tax. It is further evidence of the need for a constitutional amendment that requires a supermajority to raise taxes.
<p>
Q:  Should the income tax simply be abolished and replaced by a sales tax?
<p>
A:  A flat tax does not eliminate the harmful aspects of income taxation; it only reduces them. Some have suggested that the better approach is to replace the income tax with a national tax on consumption. While attractive in theory, however, the danger is that Americans could end up not with a sales tax replacing the income tax but with a sales tax <i>and</i> an income tax. A sales tax should be considered only as part of a campaign to repeal the 16th Amendment (which allowed the income tax). Otherwise, such an effort could play into the hands of those who want to impose a national sales tax or value-added tax (VAT) as one more way for politicians to get new money to spend.
<p>
Q:  Does a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?
<p>
A:  It all depends on how the flat tax is structured. The marriage penalty refers to the increased tax a couple face if they choose to get married. A flat tax automatically solves part of this problem since it would no longer be possible for one spouse's income to push a couple into a higher tax bracket. The penalty also arises, however, if the personal exemption for a married couple is not twice the size of the exemption for those filing singly. By giving a married couple twice the exemption of a single filer, the Armey proposal solves this problem. 
<p>
 Q:  What counts as taxable income under a flat tax?  Fringe benefits?  Capital gains?
<p>
A:  A key principle of most flat tax proposals is that all income be taxed, but only once. Capital gains would be taxed at the business level, but the tax would not be applied a second time at the individual level. Dividend income would be taxed in similar fashion. Fringe benefits are not taxed at all under the current system, but they would be subject to tax, typically on the business level, under most flat tax proposals.
<p>
Q:  How does a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?
<p>
A:  Most flat tax proposals, including the Armey plan, reform the corporate income tax as well as the personal income tax. Most, however, do not address payroll taxes. Both Social Security and Medicare face significant long-term structural problems. But while flat taxes could be designed to include substantial reform of Social Security and Medicare financing mechanisms, most lawmakers believe that problems of the income tax code should be addressed separately from those faced by retirement programs.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The current income tax system punishes the economy, imposes heavy compliance costs on taxpayers, rewards special interests, and makes America less competitive. A flat tax would reduce these ill effects dramatically. Perhaps more important, it would reduce the federal government's power over the lives of taxpayers and get the government out of the business of trying to micromanage the economy. There will never be a tax that is good for the economy, but the flat tax moves the system much closer to where it should be- raising the revenues government demands, but in the least destructive and least intrusive way possible.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
     Overtaxed American families finally have reason to cheer. There
is growing bipartisan sentiment in favor of passing tax cuts for
families with dependent children as part of next year's budget.
Congressional Republicans recently announced their commitment to
reintroducing next year the $500-per-child tax cut they proposed in
this year's Republican budget alternative. Also, reports now indicate
that there is renewed White House interest ("Clinton Still Favors
Middle-Class Tax Cut Despite Broken Vow," The Washington Times,
September 7, 1994. See also David Wessel, "For Clinton, the Politics
of a Tax Cut Are Sure to Clash With the Economics," The Wall Street
Journal, September 6, 1994; Hobart Rowen, "Economic, Political
Advisers Collide Over Clinton's Middle-Class Tax Cut," The Washington
Post, September 11, 1994.) in fulfilling Bill Clinton's campaign
promise to "grant additional tax relief to families with children."
(Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Putting People First (New York: Times
Books, 1992), p. 100.) Though skeptical voters may see such reports as
merely election year politics, there seems to be sufficient common
ground to give struggling families hope that tax cuts could move to
the top of Washington's agenda next year.<P>
     There are sound reasons why Washington should quit talking about
cutting taxes for families and take the necessary action to make it a
reality:
<P>
Families with children are overtaxed. In 1948, the average American
     family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to Uncle
     Sam. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent. (This figure
     includes federal income and Social Security payroll taxes.)
<P>
Families have been taxed out of house and home. The average family now
     loses $10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase
     in federal taxes as a share of family income. This tax loss
     exceeds the annual cost of the average family home. (For more
     information, see Robert Rector, "Reducing the Crushing Tax Burden
     on America's Families," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 981,
     March 7, 1994.)
<P>
Millions of families stand to benefit. The families of 52 million
     American children, or 60 million families, are eligible for a
     $500-per-child tax credit.
<P>
Tax cuts are good for low-income families. A $500-per-child tax credit
     would eliminate the entire federal tax burden for 4.7 million
     working families.
<P>
Most families are middle-class. Nearly 86 percent of all children live
     in families with incomes below $75,000 per year -- middle-income
     by any standard -- and some 94 percent live in families with
     incomes below $100,000.
<P>
Cutting taxes for all families -- regardless of income -- is fair. A
     $500-per-child tax credit would give a family of four earning
     $18,000 per year a 33 percent tax cut and a family earning
     $40,000 per year a 10 percent tax cut, while giving a family
     earning $200,000 per year a cut of only 1.5 percent.
<P>
Family tax relief is good politics. The typical congressional district
     has some 117,000 children eligible for a $500 tax credit. This
     means families in the typical district would receive $59 million
     per year in tax relief.
<P>
     The family is the core of American society. It is the principal
mechanism through which values, knowledge, discipline, and motivation
are passed from one generation to the next. If the family is weakened,
government programs cannot repair the damage. But government policies,
especially tax policies, are undermining the American family. The
ever-increasing tax burden on families with children must be reversed
if American society is to regain its health and vitality.
<P>
<B> BIPARTISAN TALK OF TAX CUTS </B><P>
     During the presidential campaign, candidate Clinton promised to
reduce the taxes paid by families with children. "Virtually every
industrialized nation recognizes the importance of strong families in
its tax code; we should too," declared Clinton. "We will lower the tax
burden on middle class Americans.... " ("Putting People First: A
National Economic Strategy for America," Clinton campaign document,
1992, p. 9.)<P>
     Until recently, President Clinton has ignored that pledge to
relieve Washington's tax burden on working families with children. On
the contrary, Clinton last year signed the largest tax increase in
American history. As a result, taxpayers this year will send some $35
billion in extra taxes to Washington.<P>
     Families with children could have been spared this new burden. In
March, the Democrat-controlled Congress rejected the $500-per-child
tax credit plan contained in the fiscal 1995 budget alternative
proposed by House and Senate Republicans. Had it passed, some 60
million American families could have deducted $500 per year from their
tax bill for each child.<P>
     The Republican tax cut plan was financed through cuts in
government spending and thus would have had no impact on the federal
budget deficit. Over five years, implementing a $500-per-child tax
credit would reduce federal tax revenues by some $108 billion. This
revenue loss, however, would be fully matched by reductions in federal
spending. Thus, the deficit would neither increase nor decrease.
     House Republicans recently announced that they will reintroduce
this plan in next year's budget. Coincidentally, perhaps, the White
House reportedly is considering tax cuts for families with children
"when the time is right." (Steven Pearlstein, "Election Year Has White
House Pondering Tax Cut Politics," The Washington Post, September 9,
1994.)<P>
     The time is right for families who have seen their income tax
burden grow by over 300 percent during the past 45 years. Since there
is growing bipartisan sentiment for family tax cuts, now would be the
time for the White House and Members of Congress to promise American
families that they will include, at a minimum, a $500-per-child tax
credit in next year's budget.
<P>
<B> HOW WASHINGTON HAS HIKED TAXES ON CHILDREN </B><P>
<I>(This section is derived largely from Robert Rector, "How to
Strengthen America's Crumbling Families," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 894, April 28, 1992.)
</I><P>
     Federal taxation of families with children has increased
dramatically over the past four decades. In 1948, the typical family
of four paid just 3 percent of its income to the federal government in
direct taxes. In 1992, the equivalent family paid nearly 24.5 percent
of its income to the federal government. As Chart 1 shows, when state
and local and indirect federal taxes are included, the tax burden on
that family equals 37.6 percent of its income.<P>
     Federal income taxes have risen much faster for families with
children in the last four decades than for other groups of Americans.
The root cause of this growing anti-family bias in the federal income
tax code is the eroding value of the personal exemption. The personal
exemption for children was intended to offset part of the annual costs
of raising a child by allowing families to deduct an amount of money
from their taxable income. In 1948, the personal exemption was $600.
This was equal to roughly 17 percent of the median income of a family
of four, then $3,468. This shielded 68 percent of that family's income
from federal income tax. Families could protect most of the remaining
32 percent by itemizing deductions or by taking the standard
deduction. The result: in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the average
family with children paid little or no income tax.<P>
     In the past four decades, however, increases in the personal
exemption have lagged far behind the rise in incomes and inflation. As
the value of the personal exemption has declined, the income tax paid
by families with children has increased. For the personal exemption
today to have the same value relative to family income that it had in
1948, it would have to had been $7,000 in 1992 and would have to rise
to $8,000 in 1996.<P>
     The second tax blow to family finances has been the increase in
Social Security taxes, technically known as "payroll taxes." In 1948,
workers paid a two percent Social Security tax on annual wages of up
to $3,000; one percent was paid directly by the employee and one
percent indirectly by the employer through the so-called employer
share. (Liberal and conservative economists agree that both shares of
the Social Security tax are in fact taxes on workers' wages. See
Joseph A. Pechman and Benjamin A. Okner, Who Bears the Tax Burden?
(Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution, 1974), pp. 25-43.)<P>
     By 1992, combined Social Security taxes had risen to 15 percent
of wages on incomes up to $55,500. While all workers have suffered
from skyrocketing payroll taxes, the burden has been most severe for
working families with children. The reason for this is that Social
Security taxes, unlike regular income taxes, are not adjusted for the
number of dependents in the family. So a working parent trying to
support a family of four feels the sting of this tax far more sharply
than a single person at the same wage level. The effect of Social
Security taxation is particularly severe on lower-income parents; a
family with an income of $25,000 per year, for instance, pays $3,750
in payroll taxes.<P>
     The Government Assault on Family Income. Chart 2 shows the growth
in direct federal taxes as a share of median family income. In 1948,
effective tax rates equaled 3 percent of income for the average family
of four. By 1970, they had risen to 16 percent; by 1992, to 24.5
percent.<P>
     The income loss due to increased taxation has seriously strained
American family finances and profoundly affected American family life.
Chart 3 shows the effects of increases in federal income and Social
Security taxes since 1948 on the finances of the average family. Total
pre-tax income for the median family of four in 1992 was $47,787.
(Data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Total pre-tax income
includes the employer share of Social Security tax deduction from the
worker's wages.) After taxes, this family's income fell to $36,915. If
federal taxes as a percentage of family income were restored to 1948
levels, the family's post-tax income would have been $10,060 higher,
or $46,975. In other words, the loss of income in 1992 because of the
increase in federal taxes as a share of family income, due to the
falling value of the personal exemption and the rise in Social
Security taxes since the late 1940s, was $10,060.<P>
     This income loss severely affects the ability of families to
support themselves. The median price of a single-family home purchased
in 1992, for instance, was $103,700. The average annual mortgage
payment on such a home (including principal and interest) was $7,380.
Thus, the annual family income loss due to increased federal tax rates
for the average family in the last four decades actually exceeds the
annual cost of an average home mortgage by 36 percent.
<P>
<B> THE SOLUTION: TAX CREDITS FOR CHILDREN</B>
 <P>    There are two practical ways to reduce the tax burden on families
with children: first, by increasing the value of the personal
exemption and, second, through the use of tax credits. Although many
positive arguments can be made for increasing the personal exemption,
the tax credit is better policy in the long run because it is less
complex and because it can be used more effectively to reduce the tax
burden on lower-income working families.
  <P>   With an income tax exemption, income equal to the amount of the
exemption is excluded from tax. Thus, for a family in the 15 percent
income tax bracket, a $500 increase in the personal exemption
decreases income taxes owed by $75. A $1,000 increase in the
exemption, as some have proposed, decreases a family's tax burden by
$150. 
   <P>  By contrast, under a tax credit, the amount of the credit is
deducted from taxes paid, directly reducing tax liability. Thus, for
the same family in the 15 percent income tax bracket, a $500 credit
decreases net taxes by $500. Another important difference between the
credit and the increased exemption is that a tax credit can be applied
to both income and Social Security taxes (both the employer's and
employee's share). Because the current personal exemption, now set at
$2,350, is already sufficient to eliminate most or all of the income
tax liability for many low-income families, increasing its value will
protect no more of their income from the IRS. A credit, though, could
relieve this family's income tax liability and offset a portion of its
Social Security taxes.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four with a gross earned income of $20,000 has a
     total federal tax liability of $3,615: $555 in income taxes and
     $3,060 in payroll taxes (both shares). A $1,000 increase in the
     personal exemption for children would reduce this family's tax
     burden by only $300 ($150 for each child), a tax cut of less than
     10 percent. However, a $500-per-child tax credit would reduce the
     family's total tax bill by $1,000, enough to eliminate their
     income tax burden and reduce their Social Security taxes by an
     additional $445. Overall, they would see their total federal tax
     burden reduced by over 27 percent. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> The $500-per-child Tax Credit is Not Refundable</B>
  <P>   When Republicans proposed the $500-per-child tax credit during
this spring's budget debate, the White House and congressional
Democrats argued that such a credit was not needed because they had
expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the 1993 tax bill.
This expanded EITC, they said, delivered tax cuts to millions of
working families with children. Such a claim is misleading and ignores
the difference between a wage subsidy and a tax cut.
  <P>   The EITC is a wage supplement for working families with children
with incomes up to $26,000 per year. It is intended to offset the
Social Security tax burden on these families and increase their wages
through a cash subsidy. As shown in Chart 4, the amount of cash
returned to some families through the EITC can exceed their entire tax
burden. Technically, this means the EITC is "refundable."
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four earning $14,000 (slightly below the official
     poverty level) will pay no income taxes but will bear a Social
     Security tax burden of roughly $2,140. This family is eligible to
     receive, however, some $2,400 from the EITC, nearly $260 more
     than their entire tax burden. For some working families, the cash
     value of the EITC can exceed their entire federal tax liability
     by as much as 60 percent. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
     By contrast, the $500-per-child tax credit is not refundable.
This means that the value of a family's tax relief may not exceed
their tax burden. However, as Chart 4 shows, low - and modest-income
families still would have a large share of their total tax burden
eased by such a credit.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four earning $17,000 per year may still have a
     total tax burden of roughly $840 after deductions and after
     receiving the EITC wage subsidy. Though a $500-per-child tax
     credit might otherwise give them $1,000 in total tax relief
     because of their two children, the fact that this credit is not
     refundable allows them to deduct only what they owe -- $840 --
     from their tax bill.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> Millions of Families Shielded from the IRS</B>
<P>     Some Democrats argued during last spring's budget debate that the
$500-per-child tax credit was not "fair" because families earning
below $16,000 per year would not get a tax cut. This argument is
ridiculous, as the preceding examples demonstrate. It is clearly
impossible to give a tax cut to families who not only do not pay in
federal taxes, but also stand to receive a substantial cash wage
subsidy from the federal government.
    <P> But for many low-income working families who do pay taxes, a $500
per-child tax credit would bring badly needed relief. Indeed,
according to The Heritage Foundation's tax simulation model, based
upon the U.S. Bureau of the Census 1992 Current Population Survey,
some 4.7 million working families would have their entire federal tax
liability eliminated if Congress enacted a $500-per-child tax credit.
  <P>   Millions of other low - or modest-income families might not have
their entire tax burden eliminated by such a credit, but they
certainly would see a dramatic decline in their tax bill, and thus a
dramatic increase in their take-home pay.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family earning $28,000 per year -- and not eligible for the
     EITC -- would have 57 percent of their income tax bill and 17
     percent of their total federal tax bill (income and payroll taxes
     totaling over $6,000) erased by a $500-per-child tax credit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B> Tax Cuts for 60 Million Families</B>
  <P>   Nationwide, the families of some 52 million American children,
some 60 million families in all, would be eligible for such a $500-
per-child tax credit. Most of the families affected by such a tax cut
fall within what can be considered the middle class. Indeed, nearly 86
percent of all children in America live in families with gross annual
incomes below $75,000 per year -- middle-class by any standard. In
fact, some 94 percent of all children live in families with gross
annual incomes below $100,000. 
   <P>  Tax cuts would bring badly needed stability to many families'
finances. As Chart 5 shows, for the typical family of four earning
$40,000 per year, a $500-per-child tax cut would cut their $9,500
total tax bill by some 10.4 percent, enough to pay one month's
mortgage on the average home.
  <P>   Upper-middle-class families will receive more modest relief. A
family earning $75,000 per year loses nearly $20,000 (approximately 27
percent of their income) to the IRS each year. A $500 tax credit for
each child would mean only a 5 percent tax cut for this family.
<P>
<B> Family Tax Relief Should Not Be Means-Tested</B>
  <P>   Every working family raising the next generation of Americans is
overtaxed. Thus, every working family, regardless of income, should be
eligible for the $500-per-child tax credit. Many Democrat Members of
Congress have argued that giving the same amount of tax relief to
middle-income families as upper-income families is not "fair." They
argue that such a credit should be "means-tested," meaning that
eligibility for the credit should be limited to families within
specified income levels, such as families earning below $75,000 per
year.
 <P>    Means-testing the family tax credit would be a serious mistake.
The tax code should not penalize children simply because of the income
of their parents. (The Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) is not means-
tested. The credit is used by working families -- many of whom are
dual-income and prosperous -- who place their children in day care.)
Because of the nature of most working careers, very few children live
in upper-income families. In fact, fewer than 83,000 live in families
with annual incomes above $200,000 per year, just 0.17 percent of all
American families. (U. S. Bureau of the Census 1992 Current Population
Survey.) Most upper-income parents hit their full earning potential
well after their children become adults themselves.
  <P>   Because of this country's progressive tax system, in which
wealthier taxpayers face higher income tax rates and stingier
deductions, the IRS punishes upper-income families far more severely
than middle-income families. Chart 5 shows, for example, that a family
of four earning $200,000 per year loses 33 percent of its income to
Uncle Sam, almost 10 percent more than is paid by the typical American
family. 
  <P>   Even within this country's progressive tax structure, these
families should still be allowed to take a $500-per-child tax credit.
The reason: the credit is a progressive tax cut by definition. The
value of a $500 credit is greater for low-income families than for
upper-income families. As Chart 5 shows, such a credit for the typical
family of four amounts to a 10.4 percent cut in taxes. But the same
credit for a family earning $200,000 per year amounts to a cut of only
1.5 percent. Members of Congress who believe in a progressive tax
system, should agree that this is "fair."
<P>
<B> Use Spending Cuts to Finance Tax Cuts</B>
  <P>   Washington's budget rules require that revenues lost to the
Treasury from tax cuts must be matched or offset by some combination
of reductions in spending or by increases in other tax revenues.
Recent reports indicate that if the White House does introduce a
family tax cut plan, those cuts would be financed primarily through
higher taxes on other taxpayers. Such a strategy would be wrong.
   <P> There are two important reasons why tax cuts should be financed
by cuts in spending. First, federal spending has grown massively over
the past 45 years, resulting in a greater share of family income lost
to federal taxes. The federal government now spends about $1.5
trillion per year, six times as much as it did in 1948, after
adjusting for inflation. Indeed, in 1993, Washington consumed 22.4
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) compared to just 12.1
percent in 1948, an 85 percent increase. Over the next five years,
this trend will continue.
 <P>    According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending
will grow by nearly $400 billion by fiscal 1999, far outpacing the
projected $367 billion growth in tax revenues. (Congressional Budget
Office, An Economic and Budget Outlook, August 1994, p. 31.) This
means that the federal deficit, after dipping slightly next year to
$162 billion, will again begin to climb. By fiscal 1999, projects CBO,
the deficit will hit $231 billion and reach nearly $400 billion by
fiscal 2004. If last year's deficit reduction plan -- which contained
the largest tax increase in history -- worked as its supporters have
claimed, this should not be happening. This upward trend certainly
makes it likely that politicians once again will have to ask taxpayers
to bear higher taxes in order to meet Washington's insatiable appetite
for spending.
   <P>  The persistent growth of government should be reversed by using
the savings achieved by substantial cuts in government spending to
finance tax cuts for families with children. Such a strategy would
shift resources away from government and back to taxpayers, not from
one group of taxpayers to another.
 <P>    Second, linking cuts in spending directly to cuts in family taxes
gives taxpayers a financial stake in the budget process and, thus, an
incentive to counter the advocates of government programs. Such a
strategy can sugar-coat the political "pain" of spending cuts,
lessening the opposition of special interests who benefit from federal
largess. Absent the reward of a $500-per-child tax cut, few taxpayers
would bother to lobby for spending cuts because, under normal
circumstances, few perceive any tangible benefit from cuts in federal
spending. However, the advocates of, say, a $1 billion federal program
do have a serious financial interest in maintaining that spending and
are willing to invest considerable resources in lobbying to convince
Members of Congress not to cut the program.
  <P>   But these political dynamics change when spending cuts are linked
to tax cuts. Politicians who are accustomed to viewing spending cuts
only in terms of the pain they inflict on certain interest groups can
now see them in terms of the large number of families helped by those
cuts. For example, the savings achieved by eliminating a $1 billion
federal program are sufficient to finance a $500-per-child tax cut for
2 million American families. Thus, the constituency that stands to
benefit from elimination of the program is far larger than the number
of those who stand to lose. If Members of Congress enacted a $500-per-
child tax cut for every working family in America, they would empower
60 million advocates of spending cuts to stand up to Washington's
special interests.
<P>
<B> All Tax Cuts Are Local</B>
 <P>    Even the most pro-family Member of Congress may be reluctant to
cut spending in order to finance tax cuts. This is because Members
like to take political credit for "bringing home the bacon,"
demonstrating to voters back home how effective they are in looking
out for the interests of their congressional districts. With every
federal road project, research grant, and construction contract,
Members issue press releases announcing how many jobs will be created
or how many constituents will benefit from this infusion of federal
funds. For many Members of Congress, cutting taxes for families may
not appear to lend itself to such credit-taking.
   <P>  This impression is mistaken. Based on Census Bureau data,
Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated the total dollar value of
a $500-per-child tax credit for every state and congressional
district. These figures are contained in the Appendix to this paper
(county data are available upon request). While the number in each
congressional district varies greatly, the average district has
117,000 children. At $500 per child, this means the average district
will receive nearly $59 million in family tax relief each year.
   <P>  It is difficult to imagine that any single federal spending
project of similar magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the
same time. Thus, the political advantages of family tax relief would
more than seem to outweigh the political disadvantages of cutting
federal spending.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION</B>
 <P>    The good news for millions of hard-working American families is
that there is growing bipartisan talk of cutting taxes for families
with dependent children. The bad news for the same families is that
this talk may not turn into action. Congress and the White House
should commit themselves now to enacting a $500-per-child tax credit
in next year's budget. 
 <P>    Such a measure would bring financial stability to the parents of
52 million American children, eliminating the entire federal tax
burden for 4.7 million working families. Nearly 86 percent of the
children eligible for this credit live in families with gross annual
incomes below $75,000, middle-class by any standard. For the typical
family of four, a $500-per-child tax credit would mean a 10 percent
cut in the overall federal tax burden. Finally, family tax relief is
good politics. Families in the typical congressional district would
receive roughly $59 million per year in tax relief, effectively
creating a powerful constituency for cutting wasteful government
spending. 
   <P>  Embattled American families do not need "investment" spending or
new social programs to improve their well-being. Such government
assistance has done little or nothing to help families, and paying for
more government programs only increases their tax burden. The best way
for the federal government to strengthen families and assist parents
in their vital role of raising the next generation of Americans is to
reduce their tax burden.

 <B> APPENDIX </B><P>
     Based on Census Bureau data, Heritage Foundation scholars have
calculated the total value of a $500-per-child tax credit for each
state and congressional district.
<P>     Nationally, there are nearly 51 million children eligible for
such a credit. Thus, in the first year of the plan, nearly $25.5
billion would be returned to American families. These results are
summarized in the first table in this appendix.
  <P>   While the number of children in each congressional district
varies greatly, the average district has 117,000 children. At $500 per
child, this means the average district will receive some $58.7 million
in family tax relief each year. The second table lists the
congressional districts by state. Included in the table are: the
number of eligible children in the district, the total amount of money
the district will receive in family tax relief, and the name of the
member representing the district.
<P>     Heritage analysts also have calculated the value of the $500-per-
child tax credit for every county in the U.S. These data are available
on request.

<h2><center><I><B>Individuals Who Save Get Third-Class 
Treatment Under The Ordinary Income Tax</h2></center></B></I>
<hr>
<P>
Our government rather freely provides loans to many foreign governments,
some of whom are (or were) communist, socialist, big government
central planners, dictators, or scoundrels.  Not infrequently,
these loans carry a zero rate of interest or a rate that's far
below market.  No collateral is required.
<P>
Many, if not most, of these loans are eventually written off as
defaults, severely written down, or rolled over with little prospect
for repayment.  In aggregate, these loans (and gifts or subsidies)
from our taxpayers' pockets amount to mega-billions of dollars
every year.
<P>
Contrast these loans, gifts, or subsidies to foreigners with the
refusal of our government to properly consider its own taxpayers'
IRA assets as representing private saving that will enhance the
government's tax revenues, not reduce them!
<P>
Rather than considering IRAs as an asset, the government treats
IRA tax deferrals as wasted spending; not unlike the writing off
of a governmental loan to, or subsidized trade with, Iraq, or
some socialist/communist country.
<P>
Completely ignored by the government are the facts that IRA assets:
 (a) are held in trust (by law) for the future payment of taxes;
(b) are invested in income-producing assets (not some foreign
government's and bureaucracy's boondoggle); (c) provide growing
amounts of capital for business enterprises and other productive
private uses, including jobs; (d) create ever-growing gains that
contribute to the economic growth of our nation; and (e) provide
tax revenue gains for our government.
<P>
It's amazing and most distressing to recognize how our government
freely gives away taxpayer money to foreigners (and then cavalierly
writes it off), while denying its taxpayers the eminently sound
financial structure of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs,
so that all taxpayers will save more to produce more!  Taxing
saving &quot;twice&quot; or more is bad enough, but then giving
away those diminished tax receipts to fund foreign boondoggles
equals third-class or &quot;steerage&quot; treatment for U.S.
taxpayers who save and invest!
<P>
<I>It's time for all savers and investors to stand up and fight
for tax sanity and their financial well-being.</I>

<title>WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL</title>

<h1>With Liberty and Justice for All</h1>
<h2><i>Redefining the Educational Choice Debate</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>E</font>ducation is a so-called mixed good. It offers both 
public and private benefits. Thus, the debate over education policy in 
America is often cast as a clash between public and private interests,
a conflict between equity and liberty. In the words of social
scientist James Coleman:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[C]ontradictions . . . arise out of two simultaneously-held values
that are very relevant to most Americans. The first is the autonomy
and choice of parents to do all they can to raise their children
to adulthood. The second is the value we place on having a society
that is not fragmented by divisions imposed by segregated or exclusive
upbringing.</i>[1]

</blockquote><p>

Liberty and equity are not mutually-exclusive concepts. But if
their proper relationship is to be achieved, policymakers must
develop a new understanding of equal opportunity based on liberty.
Education policy in America today often fails to pay respect to
the need for parents to direct their children's upbringing. Indeed,
calls for parental choice in education typically run headlong
into the myth of the &quot;common school&quot; and the rhetoric
of &quot;equal opportunity&quot; -- outmoded ideas which the education
establishment successfully employs to protect its vested interest.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Paine believed that most poor<br>
parents were well aware of the<br>
benefits of education and that<br>
heavy taxation was the chief<br>
cause of their under-investment<br>
in education.

Thus, a gradual &quot;demythologizing&quot; of the common school
as the bulwark of democracy and the ultimate expression of equal
opportunity will be necessary to sustain any hope of expanding
private liberty (and improving student performance) through parental
choice in education. Otherwise, the political power of the teacher
unions and the philosophical tensions inherent in education will
continue to render choice an elusive goal.

<p>

<center><h3>No Paine, No Gain</h3></center>

<p>

Political theorists have long debated whether government should
be involved in education in any capacity. More than two centuries
ago, Thomas Jefferson made an eloquent case for a state role in
education in a letter to George Wythe:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Preach, my dear Sir, a crusade against ignorance, establish and
improve the law for educating the common people. Let our countrymen
know that the people alone can protect us against these evils,
and that the tax which will be paid for this purpose is not more
than the thousandth part of what will be paid to kings, priests
and nobles who will rise up among us if we leave the people in
ignorance.</i>[2]

</blockquote><p>

Interestingly, many of the classical economists who were busy
ardently defending laissez-faire economic policies in Jefferson's
day were also forceful advocates of a state role in education.
Adam Smith argued in <I>The Wealth of Nations</I> that the market
would fail to capture the social benefits of education because
of the divergence between public and private interests.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But Smith stopped short of issuing an unqualified endorsement
of state-sponsored education. Contrasting the quality of education
under public and private arrangement, Smith argued that private
schools were more successful in cultivating skills in reading,
writing and arithmetic.[3] While eager to promote the education of
all students, Smith did not share the conviction of Jeremy Bentham
and other utilitarians that government could successfully administer
education. Instead, he argued for a wide dispersal of educational
expenditure and decision-making to prevent teacher compensation
from being made independent of effort.

<p>

Similarly, Thomas Paine believed that most poor parents were well
aware of the benefits of education and that heavy taxation was
the chief cause of their underinvestment in education. Paine proposed
a much more far-reaching decentralization of authority that would
further increase parental freedom of choice and competition among
schools. In <I>The Rights of Man</I>, he proposed &quot;to make
a remission of taxes to every poor family out of the surplus taxes
. . . enjoining the parents of such children to send them to 
school.&quot;[4]

<p>

John Stuart Mill's writings on the question of state education
are ambiguous and at times self-contradictory because he, too,
was acutely aware of the tension between personal liberty and
the public purposes of education. On the one hand, Mill differed
from Paine. Mill believed that government must control education
because parents were incompetent to judge their children's best
interests. But in a moment of supreme doubt, he wrote: &quot;A
general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding [sic]
people to be exactly like one another. . . it establishes a despotism
over the mind.&quot;[5] Mill's enthusiasm for state schools, moreover,
depended on the assumption that the public schools would always
be superior to private institutions. He wrote in <I>On Liberty</I>
that a state school should exist, &quot;if it exist at all, as
one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose
of example and stimulus, to keep the others up to a certain standard
of excellence.&quot;[6] Mill's sympathy for government paternalism
did not extend to justifying inefficient and inferior education
in the name of broad public purposes.

<p>

In the earliest years of the Republic, parental fees provided
the majority of funding for schools, as Adam Smith and Thomas
Paine had recommended. As parents exercised their freedom to determine
the shape of their children's education, the great heterogeneity
of the nation expressed itself in the diversity and autonomy of
its local schools.

<p>

Nineteenth century reformers, however, launched a campaign to
redefine education as the means to restore morality, justice and
social conformity. A public-purpose rationale began to triumph
over respect for the private benefits afforded parents by the
freedom and genuine diversity in the schools. Under Horace Mann's
leadership, reformers succeeded in creating a system that was
&quot;bureaucratic and professional, designed to ensure, so the
story goes, that education would be taken out of politics and
placed in the hands of impartial experts devoted to the public
interest.&quot; It was the &quot;one best system,&quot; also referred
to as the &quot;common school.&quot;[7]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Egalitarian democracy was now operationally-defined as centrally-planned
uniformity, secured through bureaucratic arrangements. According
to education historian E.G. West, however, it was teachers and
government officials, not discontented parents, who brought about
the change.[8] And, as economist Milton Friedman has observed, it
was hardly an apolitical enterprise: &quot;Though the arguments
were all pitched in terms of the public interest, much of the
support of teachers and administrators for the public school movement
derived from a narrow self-interest,&quot; including greater control
over the schools and almost guaranteed salaries now that government
was the paymaster.[9] Friedman notes that reformers simply capitalized
on public sympathy for the concept of equal opportunity to succeed
in establishing universal, &quot;free&quot; and compulsory education.[10]
That same egalitarian impulse had already found private expression
in the form of charity schools and the adjustment of school fees
according to means, as West and other historians report.[11]

<p>

<center><h3>From Equity to Liberty</h3></center>

<p>

Over the last three decades, it has become increasingly evident
that the public school is failing to fulfill its high-minded egalitarian
purpose. Equity &quot;based on homogeneity has occurred only by
discriminating against some, segregating others, and denying the
possibilities of alternative ways of life.&quot;[12] Historian David
Cohen explains:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Education has long been seen as both the chief antidote to
poverty and the principal means for assimilating ethnic and racial
minorities. . . . Since [the late 1960s], however, events have
cast serious doubt on these two venerable articles of faith .
. . that education is the high road to equality or social 
integration.</i>[13]

</blockquote><p>

In 1966, Coleman released his now-famous Equality of Educational
Opportunity report, concluding that differences in the quality
of the nation's schools bear only a trivial relationship to differences
in the educational achievement of the nation's students. Coleman's
report posed a fundamental question: If schools have little effect
on differences in children's achievement, is state-controlled
public education the key to social justice?

<p>

At about the same time, empirical evidence of low academic performance
in the public schools caused Friedman to start repopularizing
criticisms of the &quot;common school&quot; first made by Smith,
Paine, and Mill. As an alternative, Friedman began calling for
educational vouchers that would give parents freedom of choice,
thereby increasing competitive supply. Given the ineffectiveness
of the present education system, he asked rhetorically, &quot;Wherein
are the 'neighborhood effects' that justify such use of tax 
money?&quot;[14]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

To broaden the base of potential support for vouchers, Friedman
took pains to argue that his proposal would actually enhance equality
of opportunity. Under the current system, he noted, wealthy families
have significantly more freedom of choice than low-income families.
Poor families are trapped in poor school districts. They lack
the resources to move or to choose private schools. &quot;Under
present arrangements, stratification of residential areas effectively
restricts the intermingling of children from decidedly different
backgrounds. . . . Our present system, far from equalizing opportunity,
very likely does the opposite.&quot;[15]

<p>

While Friedman questioned the practical interpretation of the
public purposes of education, he appealed primarily to a philosophical
commitment to individual liberty. &quot;Persuasive as [the] argument
[for achieving a common core of values] is, . . . [o]n grounds
of principle, it conflicts with the preservation of freedom itself,&quot;
he wrote.[16] Friedman suggested that the circumstances that justified
the definition of education as a predominantly public good in
the Progressive Era were eclipsed by circumstances that now favor
the definition of education as a private good.

<p>

While vouchers appealed to Friedman as a means to introduce the
efficiency of the market into education, liberal social analyst
Christopher Jencks embraced vouchers as a means to equalize opportunity
by improving the education of low-income and minority children.
Favoring egalitarian over libertarian goals, he designed a voucher
experiment for the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) in the
1960s that included heavy regulatory burdens governing admissions
policies, fiscal incentives for schools to accept poor students,
and the creation of an educational voucher agency to oversee the
program. The OEO voucher experiment demonstrated the problems
of policy design and political opposition that would hamper implementation
of educational choice even after changing philosophical definitions
had begun to broaden its appeal.

<p>

In most of the prospective test sites, local educators and grass-roots
organizations blocked Jencks' proposal. &quot;In effect, there
was no constituency for a plan that threatened the job security
of teachers [and] compromised the independence of private schools.&quot;[17]
Finally, the Alum Rock school district in California agreed to
the voucher demonstration; but, &quot;the process of negotiation
between federal sponsors and local interest groups resulted in
a dramatic alteration of the voucher plan. Ultimately, no private
schools participated . . . [and] [n]o teachers in unpopular programs
lost their jobs. In fact, none of the incentives usually thought
to spur initiative in the private sector were present in Alum
Rock.&quot;[18] Interestingly, Jencks and his associates concluded
that, &quot;if restrictions are too rigid, a voucher system is
likely to be indistinguishable from the present public school
system.&quot;[19] Conservatives argued that the regulations Jencks
himself proposed to satisfy equity requirements emasculated the
voucher concept, precluding an adequate test of educational choice.

<p>

The unregulated character of Friedman's proposals, however, still
posed too great a risk to liberal policymakers to win passage.
Writing at the time, education analyst Dennis Doyle observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The basic reason that policymakers will not support either
Jencks or Friedman vouchers is that the dimension of vouchers
that makes them interesting -- choice -- still threatens an egalitarian
society. At the present time only one important interest group
might change this, and that group is minorities in general, especially
[black Americans]. . . . [T]here is a growing body of minority
and black opinion which holds that choice itself is the key to
equality -- and that without choice, equal educational opportunity
will remain unfulfilled.</i>[20]

</blockquote><p>

Alum Rock proved to be an early sign of increasing national interest
in the concept of educational choice -- coupled with persistently
dubious prospects for political passage of any far-reaching voucher
proposal.

<p>

<center><h3>Toward a Philosophical Redefinition</h3></center>

<p>

As the limitations of the common school have grown increasingly
obvious and the case for educational choice more plausible, choice
opponents have clung more desperately to the &quot;myth of the
common school&quot; as a pluralist and apolitical institution.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

families trapped in poor<br>
school districts.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

From the outset, a primary objective of the common school was
the socialization of all children in an overtly religious, yet
non-sectarian environment. Educator Charles Glenn's book <I>The
Myth of the Common School</I> portrays the movement toward state
education as a mission to acculturate immigrants into the predominantly
Protestant culture of 19th-century America. The religion of the
early common school was a least-common-denominator Christianity
tending toward the Unitarianism of the schools' founding fathers.
Central Protestant doctrines like sin, and salvation by faith
in Christ were expunged as committee review of curriculum and
teaching took hold, implanting a more muted religion of good and
evil, along with a hefty dose of strictly civic morality. Catholics,
Jews, and Lutherans, often the alien target of the common school
movement, found their beliefs discouraged and discounted as 
&quot;sectarian&quot; in the new schools. So began the tradition of 
&quot;publicly-sponsored orthodoxy,&quot; as long-time education observer 
Stephen Arons calls it, in which the government defines through the 
public schools a set of &quot;normative&quot; values and beliefs.[21]

<p>

But even genuine efforts to find common ground are of little avail,
for education is the very enterprise of discovering and defending
first principles. It cannot be replaced by some &quot;value-neutral&quot;
process. As Aristotle said, education is about teaching the young
to lead the good life. Since men disagree about what the good
life is, men disagree about education. Glenn muses that &quot;we
may have set ourselves an impossible task in seeking to provide
a single model of education that is to be at once capable of nurturing
character and civic virtue and yet inoffensive to the conviction
of any parent.&quot;[22] Reformers eager to employ the common school
as an agent of social change offend parents' beliefs all the more.

<p>

The socialization mission is a flat violation of families' First
Amendment freedoms of belief and expression, argues Arons. The
First Amendment, he believes, not only protects parents' freedom
to express their beliefs, but also to pass on those beliefs to
their children.[23] Yet, compulsory public education forces parents
to surrender these tender matters of conscience to the political
majority. Aron continues, &quot;The level of coercion required
to resolve these value conflicts would be inconsistent with personal
liberty and political democracy.&quot;[24] While some argue that private
schools provide an adequate escape hatch from the public schools,
Arons argues that requiring parents to purchase their First Amendment
freedoms is as crass as taxing voters to enter the polls.

<p>

Thus, he concludes: &quot;[T]he present structure of public education
is unconstitutional because the primary victims of the unequal
distribution of liberty are the poor, working people and racial
minorities.&quot;[25] The comment reflects a subtle but critically
important reframing of the equity debate. By defining equity as
more nearly an &quot;equality of liberty,&quot; Arons offers a
fledgling strategy to help temper sharp oscillations between liberty
and equity, or private and public purposes, in education.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

private good.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But Arons also casts specific doubt on the priority of the public
benefits of education: &quot;The legitimacy of the political consensus,
however weak, may be eliminated by government interference in
the process of belief and value formation.&quot;[26] Arons' searching
concern echoes the early 20th-century cautions of Princeton theologian
J. Gresham Machen that monopolistic state education would be &quot;the
most effective engine of tyranny and intellectual stagnation that
has yet been devised.&quot;[27] Machen argued that only competition
with private schools would keep the state schools healthy and
thus admonished a group of Christian school educators, &quot;May
the distinctiveness of your Christian schools never be lost; may
it never give place, by a false 'Americanization,' to a drab uniformity
which is the most un-American thing that could possibly be 
conceived!&quot;[28]

<p>

If coercion on matters of conscience results in further splintering
of communities, Arons seems to suggest government monopoly of
education may negate its public benefits altogether.

<p>

<center><h3>Are Vouchers the Right Mechanism?</h3></center>

<p>

If the argument for parental choice in education is based on the
philosophy of freedom from coercion, then the mechanism for choice
cannot be permitted to increase state coercion of parents or the
private sector.

<p>

Funding and regulation are the two defining characteristics of
public agencies, nearly always appearing hand in hand. The unhappy
results are dramatically evident in Canada, where some provinces'
religious and private schools are a part of the public school
system and receive state funding. Today many religious schools
depend heavily on subsidies from the Canadian government and have
subsequently lost their defining character.[29]

<p>

While voucher proponents originally made little distinction, today
they are careful to specify that voucher payments must flow directly
to parents or students -- not to private institutions. First Amendment
attorney William Bentley Ball argues that such precision is necessary
to sidestep potential entanglement problems.[30]

<p>

Nevertheless, many perceive the difference between aid to religious
institutions and aid to individuals to be only semantic and believe
vouchers do pose a threat to religious schools.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The threat of future tinkering with the language of such laws
should not be dismissed, according to education researcher Chester
Finn. &quot;Some [private schools] to be sure, like to think they...can
obtain aid without saddling themselves with unacceptable forms
of regulation. But most...are more or less resigned to amalgamating
or choosing between assistance and autonomy.&quot;[31]

<p>

In the current federal political landscape, the compromises necessary
to achieve a winning voucher proposal come at too dear a price
for many would-be supporters. In the recent debate over vouchers
for the District of Columbia, the political payoff for the key
support of centrist Sen. Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.) was the surrender
of the basic principle for which every true religious school exists:
the fusion of faith and learning. Jeffords demanded and won the
addition of two provisions regarding religion. The first established
a religious opt-in provision requiring written consent from parents
for students to participate in religious courses or activities.
The second was even more worrisome to friends of religious liberty,
mandating that no school could use the voucher money to pay for
its religious courses or activities. Given such provisions, James
Cardinal Hickey made it clear that schools of the Archiocese of
Washington, D.C. would not participate in the voucher program.
With Catholic schools totalling some 80 percent of the private
schools in the city, the D.C. voucher scenario was nearly a re-run
of Alum Rock.

<p>

<center><h3>Concerns Specific to Means-Tested Vouchers</h3></center>

<p>

Means-tested vouchers, in particular, suffer from several potentially
fatal flaws. Assessing social reforms in the 1970s, Irving Kristol
comments that &quot;[p]ractically all social reforms 'work' in
that they do distribute some benefits to the people whom they
aim to help.&quot;[32] Means-tested vouchers would very likely 
&quot;work&quot; to improve the educational prospects of a few low-income 
children -- perhaps even helping to mold the next Clarence Thomas. Kristol
quickly notes, however, that there are two problems inherent in
giving money only to the poor.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Today many religious schools in<br>
Canada have come to depend heavily<br>
on subsidies from the government<br>
and have subsequently lost their<br>
defining character.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The primary difficulty is that means-tested benefits always establish
a huge disincentive for families on the margin to escape the poverty
trap.

<p>

Moreover, Kristol argues that means-tested benefits do a
grave disservice to a society by establishing an arbitrary definition
of &quot;poor.&quot;

<p>

Social reform, in other words, should actively seek to minimize
class conflict by advancing low- and middle-income interests in
tandem. A recent column by William Raspberry of <I>The Washington
Post</I> confirms the perspicacity of Kristol's insight. &quot;The
recent political trend,&quot; Raspberry observes, &quot;is to
legislate luck for entire classes of people. Some get the breaks,
and some get suckered. . . .It isn't that Americans no longer
care about the common good, but that they have lost faith in mutuality.
They're afraid of being played for suckers.&quot;[33]

<p>

Both survey and anecdotal evidence suggest that school voucher
proposals may indeed be falling prey to class resentment over
policies that tax Reagan voters to bestow benefits on Clinton
backers. In the wake of the school choice defeat in California,
pollster Frank Luntz found that seven out of 10 Californians said
they do not favor exclusive targeting of lower-income students.
On the other hand, two-thirds of all California voters said that
they would be willing to support choice in education in the future
if it did not cost any additional tax money.[34]

<p>

Gene Piccolo of the Choice in Education League in Minnesota reports
voter concern over the potential of the pending voucher initiative
in his state to create a new entitlement. He also reports a subtle
but distinctive undertone of middle-class suburbanite resentment
among voucher opponents -- perhaps, he believes, because Minnesota
already boasts one of the highest levels of public welfare spending
in the country.

<p>

&quot;Publicly-funded compassion fatigue&quot; may render means-tested
vouchers a political non-starter in other parts of the country
as well. The success of the privately- funded voucher (or scholarship)
movement, by contrast, suggests that Americans are beginning to
draw a sharp distinction between &quot;compassion&quot; and government
solutions -- and between &quot;compassion&quot; and equality in
the egalitarian sense.

<p>

<center><h3>A New Look at Tax Credits</h3></center>

<p>

Given the failure to establish a full educational choice program
anywhere in the U.S. after nearly a quarter century, choice proponents
must challenge themselves to develop a new scheme. The proposal
should place a premium on liberty and on the private benefits
of education while reformulating the public-purpose rhetoric employed
by the education establishment. A new proposal should also avoid
the weaknesses associated with vouchers, including the menace
of government regulation, consistent challenges to their constitutionality,
dim prospects for political passage, the danger of expanding an
entitlement mentality and a narrow coalition of beneficiaries
to support passage. A refundable tax credit scheme is more likely
to overleap these hurdles than means-tested voucher demonstration
projects.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The more universal the private benefits, the more likely the U.S.
Supreme Court will be to uphold the proposal. In the 1983 case
<I>Mueller v. Allen</I>, the court held that a program &quot;that
neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens
is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment 
Clause.&quot;[35] The program in question was a Minnesota tax deduction 
for tuition, transportation and textbooks, which had been broadly defined 
to include extra educational benefits for even public school students.

<p>

However, by defining &quot;allowable uses&quot; or &quot;eligible
institutions,&quot; tax benefits linked to tuition may carry the
same threat of regulation as vouchers. Or they might exclude religious
institutions altogether. But a refundable tax credit for the &quot;non-use
of the public school&quot; would avoid such meddling, eliminating
the need to define allowable uses of the tax credit. Since 
&quot;non-users&quot; of the public schools already exist, there would be 
no further need to define or regulate recipients. Recently proposed in 
Idaho, the tax credit for the non-use of the public school received a
favorable review from the state attorney general, who cited it
as fundamentally different from both the tuition tax credits and
the vouchers which the state's strict definition of separation
of church and state would prohibit. &quot;[T]he proposed initiative's
grant of the tax credit to parents of all non-public school students
-- home-schooled, private non-sectarian, and private parochial
-- coupled with the absence of a direct financial benefit to parochial
schools, makes it probable this proposal will be upheld under
the U.S. Constitution.&quot;[36]

<p>

A two-tiered mediating proposal might offer a small, &quot;standard&quot;
educational tax credit of perhaps $500 to all parents of school-aged
children, and a larger tax credit of up to $3,000 for &quot;itemized&quot;
educational expenditures, broadly defined to include everything
from enrichment experiences for the public school student to private
school tuition to home school expenses. (As a general rule, tax
credits should be no higher than the average cost of local private
school tuition -- which is generally $2,500 to $3,000.[37] If keyed
to the average public school per-pupil expenditure -- as some
voucher plans propose -- the efficiency of the marketplace is
undermined by artificial inflation.)

<p>

This would limit the threat of regulation while expanding the
coalition of beneficiaries.[38]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Any proposal, however, must be considered in light of state constitutions.
Given the variance among state constitutions, as exemplified by
Idaho and Minnesota, educational choice proposals are probably
best handled at the state level. State action will be increasingly
viable as grass-roots sentiment mounts to eliminate the federal
role in education.

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

In <I>Perspectives on the Reagan Years</I>, political analyst
John Palmer argues that the Reagan Administration heightened public
awareness of an inevitable tension among political values that
decades of economic prosperity had obscured. Palmer refers to
the tensions among efficiency, social equity, and individual liberty
-- the reconciliation of which John Maynard Keynes identified
as &quot;the political problem of mankind.&quot; Just as education
was one component of the Great Society poverty programs, educational
choice was a key component of the Reagan Administration's efforts
to remake the welfare state in the image of its own philosophy.
The Reagan Administration argued that the American version of
the welfare state unduly sacrificed both individual liberty and
efficiency in the pursuit of social justice and that more diligent
concern for the former would inevitably promote the latter.

<p>

Reagan officials trumpeted educational choice as a means to mediate
between the competing values of liberty and equality -- a role
that could not have been claimed for choice without a substantial
redefinition of equality in the wake of Great Society failures.
In the words of former Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos, appointed
by Reagan, &quot;[e]vidence shows that the growing demand for
parental choice in the United States derives not simply from a
desire for improved test scores, but from changing perspectives
on liberty and equity. It flows from an urgent reconsideration
of the role of the family and of other institutions and associations
that mediate between the individual and the State.&quot;[39]

<p>

Conservative advocates of choice must move quickly to popularize
a definition of social justice that reserves respect for individual
liberty and the primacy of the family. A more thorough attempt
at reconciling &quot;equality&quot; with &quot;liberty&quot; is
beyond the scope of the present paper. Suffice it to say that
the central issue is human dignity; that the phrase &quot;all
men are created equal&quot; promises no more -- and no less --
than equal moral worth, and that freedom is the air that true
equality must breathe to survive.

<BR><FONT SIZE=7>Clinton seeks to please<BR>gays and moderates</FONT>
<HR WIDTH=50%>By Paul Bedard<BR><font size=1>
The Washington Times</font><HR WIDTH=30%></center>


<BR><DD>President Clinton is wooing homosexual voters and AIDS activists, who were angered by his handling of their issues earlier in his term, by making new promises to consider expanded civil rights - including same-sex &quot;marriages.&quot;

<BR><DD>Capitalizing on a top issue in the community, Marsha Scott, Mr. Clinton's liaison to homosexual activists, is seeking suggestions on what position the president should take on same-sex marriages.

<BR><DD>In Boston recently, Miss Scott told a homosexual group, &quot;We [need] to find ways to ensure that those of you in these loving, long-term and committed relationships can enjoy all the same benefits that [heterosexual couples] are entitled to under the law.&quot;

<BR><DD>She added that using same-sex marriages may not be the right &quot;vehicle&quot; now but said, &quot;I'm going to argue that we broaden the context and look at the rights that gays and lesbians have ... and where those rights are denied.&quot;

<BR><DD>Asked about Miss Scott's little-noticed statements, a senior administration official said homosexual marriage is &quot;not something we intend to espouse.&quot;

<BR><DD>The official said that the White House will leave it to states to decide the issue, and that Mr. Clinton wants to do &quot;everything we can to support&quot; traditional marriages between heterosexuals.

<BR><DD>But the aide added: &quot;The president is aware that many communities and institutions are considering whether certain basic benefits can be provided outside the context of traditional marriage. The challenge in addressing these issues is to remain sensitive to the traditional values of our communities while preserving the fundamental right to live free from unjustified discrimination.&quot;

<BR><DD>Mr. Clinton, said the official, is &quot;personally&quot; opposed to homosexual marriages.

<BR><DD>Opponents of Mr. Clinton, however, noted that he also &quot;objected&quot; to late-term partial-birth abortions but vetoed a ban on the procedure.

<BR><DD>Conservative and liberal critics of the president complained about the aide's comments, which they said were designed merely to solicit support for the president. Miss Scott did not return a reporter's phone call.

<BR><DD>Steve Michael, a third-party presidential candidate supported by ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, said &quot;they're making more empty promises.&quot;

<BR><DD>Robert Knight of the conservative Family Research Council said, &quot;The president is between a rock and a hard place, because he knows embracing same-sex marriage would alienate most voters who view him as a moderate.&quot;

<BR><DD>In an interview with Windows, New England's largest homosexual newspaper, Miss Scott said that in a Dole-Clinton race, &quot;I think you have extremely clear choices. You are either at the political table with a Clinton administration, or there is not even a door for you to get to the table.&quot;

<title>The Senate Faces Term Limits - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>THE SENATE FACES TERM LIMITS</h3>

By Kenneth R. Weinstein<br>
Director, Government Reform Project<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<p>
Backgrounder Update No. 274<br>
April 19, 1996<br>
<p>
(Updating David M. Mason, "House Term Limit Options: Good, Better, Best," Heritage Foundation <I>Executive Memorandum</I> No. 406, March 22, 1995.)
<p><hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Next week, the U.S. Senate will make history as it begins consideration of  <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.j.res.00021:">S.J. Res. 21</a>, a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms members of the House and Senate may serve. The amendment provides a uniform term limit of 12 years for House members and Senators.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Term limits are needed because long-term congressional incumbency tends to distort the character of representation. By becoming overly oriented toward the federal government and insulated from the public, Members of Congress can develop a set of interests and sympathies at odds with those held by their constituents. Term limits therefore would work to keep elected officials more in touch with voters. In addition, frequent rotation in office would help assure a continuous flow of new energy and innovative thinking in Congress.
<p>
<b>THE PUBLIC JUDGMENT </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among major public policy issues, term limits enjoys virtually unrivaled public support. As far back as 1964, a Gallup poll recorded a 49 percent plurality of Americans favoring term limits; since then, support has swelled to 64 percent in 1990 and 73 percent in 1995. Moreover, even though a reform-minded Congress was elected in 1994, support for term limits continued to grow to 77 percent in 1996.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, unlike other "hot-button" issues whose support withers in the heat of public debate, support for term limits remains firm. Between 1990 and 1995, initiatives were approved in 23 states, with support averaging 66 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yet, despite this overwhelming public support, in May 1995, the Supreme Court declared in <I>U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton</I> that state-imposed term limits on federal lawmakers are unconstitutional. Thus, if federal term limits are to be enacted, the only remaining course appears to be adoption of a constitutional amendment such as S.J. Res. 21.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The electoral tsunami of 1994 was due in no small part to public support for term limits, so the new majority in Congress has a special obligation to deliver on this issue. Indeed, ten of the 12 freshman senators already have announced their support for term limits. As public support continues to grow, long-term incumbents opposed to term limitsespecially those from states that already place term limits on their state and local officialsmust explain why they continue to ignore the public will.
<p>
<b>TEN LEADING MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT TERM LIMITS</b>
<p><ol>
<b><li>Claim: Term limits are an untested innovation. 
<p>
Fact: Along with the President, 37 governors are subject to term limits.</b> Term limits were contained in America's first governing document, the Articles of Confederation of 1781, but were not written into the Constitution, primarily because its authors saw them as "entering into too much detail" for a short document.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Claim: The election of scores of new Senators and Representatives in 1994 disproves the need for term limits.
<p>
Fact: 314 of the 348 incumbent House members who sought re-election won -- a re-election rate of 90 percent.</b> Fully 92 percent of incumbent Senators -- 24 of 26 candidates -- won re-election.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Claim: Campaign finance reform will render term limits obsolete. 
<p>
Fact: Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN) has called term limits "the ultimate campaign finance reform vehicle."</b>  Term limits create open seats, which lead to contested races. These races are more competitive because they are less costly: Challengers do not have to compensate for the fundraising advantage held by incumbents, who nearly always win.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Term limits will deprive the nation of talented legislators. 
<p>
Fact: Self-governance is the basic supposition of democracy. </b>It is sheer arrogance to maintain that only one person in a half-million is qualified to be in Congress. Furthermore, while term-limited Senators and Representatives could serve in different capacities, other talented individuals would be given opportunity for advancement.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Term limits are undemocratic because they restrict voter choice. 
<p>
Fact: Incumbents enjoy electoral advantages franking, staff, and travel allowances that present huge barriers to entry by challengers.</b> Moreover, experience at the state level suggests that term limits actually increase voter choice. In California, for instance, the imposition of state-level term limits in 1990 led to an increase of over 25 percent in campaign filings for the Senate and a similar increase of over 50 percent in filings for the Assembly by 1992.<sup>5</sup>  During the past half-century, gubernatorial races have been more competitive in term-limited states -- even in years when governors can run for re-election.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: The limited-government agenda of the 104th Congress means that term limits are no longer needed to fight pork-barrel politics. 
<p>
Fact: The longer individuals serve in Congress, the greater their propensity to support new spending initiatives.</b><sup>7</sup>  The frequent rotation imposed by term limits, on the other hand, would help to institutionalize the 104th Congress's bias against big spending.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Conservatives should avoid amending the Constitution at all costs. 
<p>
Fact: As George Will, a former opponent of term limits, argues, term limits offer a necessary constitutional corrective to the profound extraconstitutional metamorphosis of the federal government.</b> The Founders envisioned a citizen legislature as the backbone of limited government; as the interventionist state arose, however, politicians began to view public office as a career.<sup>8</sup>  Term limits would work to restore the Founders' intent by diminishing the tendency of Members of Congress to exploit their legally acquired powers to remain in office.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: As Senators find their terms limited, the Senate's capacity for deliberation and independent judgment likewise will be restricted. 
<p>
Fact: Term limits enhance the capacity for independence</b> by discouraging excessive concentration on fund-raising, re-election, and catering to special interests.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: If term limits are such a good idea, they should be imposed retroactively. 
<p>
Fact: Rather than openly oppose term limits, opponents have pursued a shrewd strategy of calling for retroactive application.</b> This argument is a red herring. Term limits represent principle, not retribution, and the public has rejected retribution. Only one retroactive congressional term limits measure has been offered to the voters (in Washington State in 1991), and it was rejected. It is not surprising that opponents of term limits are the only ones pushing for retroactive application.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Under term limits, unelected individuals will run Congress. 
<p>
Fact: This argument assumes that the departure of senior incumbents will create a vacuum in which more and more decisions are made by lobbyists and staff.</b> Lobbyists thrive because they cultivate relationships with long-term incumbents; rapid turnover would greatly diminish the value of such contacts. As for staff, anyone who has seen a congressional office knows that Congressmen give assignments rather than take them. The specter of career staff manipulating freshman Members has little support in reality. In a non-term-limited Congress, staff employees work on average between five and six years.<sup>9</sup>  Under term limits, new Members would likely replace aides to former Congressmen with employees of their own choosing.
</ol><p>
<b>THE SENATE VOTE AND THE THREAT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One of the few reforms devised and implemented by people who live beyond the Beltway, term limits are a tribute to public involvement in politics. Yet, despite powerful grassroots support, term-limit laws in 23 states were overturned in May 1995 by the U.S. Supreme Court -- after the U.S. House of Representatives had failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to ratify a federal constitutional amendment.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Frustrated by the Court's ruling and skeptical of Congress's desire to pass a constitutional amendment, some activists are pursuing a radical approach: calling for two-thirds of America's 50 state legislatures to approve an unprecedented constitutional convention to impose term limits. State legislatures in North Dakota and Utah already have called for such a convention. This year, 11 states will offer ballot measures to instruct state legislators to vote for a constitutional convention on term limits. Activists hope to garner the support of 34 state legislatures by the year 1999.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Term limits will remain a potent issue in 1996. President Clinton has decided to ignore the continued groundswell by opposing term limits. By contrast, Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) deserves credit for assuring that they will be considered by the U.S. Senate. Whether members of the Senate will continue to ignore public opinion -- thereby fueling the drive for a term limits constitutional convention -- remains to be seen.

<p>
Sidebar: <a href="#rector">In Welfare Reform, Governors Miss the Point</a> by Robert Rector.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since the Republican victories of November 8, 1994, the press has focused on the dramatic changes in Congress. With a net gain of 52 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and eight seats in the U.S. Senate, the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Party-switching and special elections have since left the partisan balance in the House of Representatives at 236 Republicans to 198 Democrats (with one independent); in the Senate, it is 53 Republicans to 47 Democrats.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This shift in party control certainly changed the direction of the national policy debate in Washington. Less than two years ago, Congress was seriously debating President Clinton's attempt to nationalize the entire health-care industry. And just a year earlier, Congress passed and Clinton signed a budget that contained what Democratic senator Pat Moynihan called the largest tax increase in the history of the world. Since the elections of 1994, however, the debate in Washington has centered on how to cut taxes and balance the budget in a way that would, over time, cut the size of the federal government from 21.2 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product to roughly 17 percent. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	
Yet the intense focus on Washington, D.C., has obscured the conservative revolution within the states. In some ways, the changes occurring in state capitals across the country are even more important than those inside the Beltway. Conservative reforms at the state level make similar efforts in Washington both more likely and, oddly, less important. The states have led the way so far, and they are quite prepared to march ahead, even if the revolution in Washington stalls.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although less visible, the 1994 shift in partisan control was more pronounced at the state and local levels than in Washington. Republicans won 24 of 36 gubernatorial races to increase the number of statehouses in their column from 19 to 30. With Mike Foster's victory in last year's gubernatorial election in Louisiana, Republicans now occupy 31 statehouses. More than 72 percent of the American people now live in states with Republican governors. Within state legislatures, the GOP gained 105 senate seats and 367 house seats in 1994 to gain control of seven upper chambers and 10 lower chambers. Since that election, 50 state legislators have switched to the GOP. 
<p>
<img src="norq.gif" align=center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These gains have historic consequences. Prior to the 1994 elections, Democrats controlled the governorship and both legislative chambers in 17 states. In these states, all labor law, election law, budgeting and taxes, redistricting, and judicial appointments were fully controlled by the Democratic Party. Republicans exercised similar control in just four states: Utah, Arizona, New Hampshire, and New Jersey. Today, the Democratic Party controls the governorship and the legislature only in Hawaii, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Maryland, while Republicans reign supreme in 15 states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nationwide shift to Republican governors affects the content of the policy debate in at least two ways. First, it intensifies the pressure from the states for more autonomy. In fact, strong lobbying by governors such as Bill Weld of Massachusetts, George Voinovich of Ohio, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, and John Engler of Michigan was crucial to Republicans' efforts in the fall of 1995 to pass their historic budget, designed to give states unprecedented power over welfare and Medicaid programs.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, a Republican Congress is more likely to fulfill its commitment to "devolution" knowing that ideologically sympathetic governors are at the helm in many key states. Despite the Republican Party's dedication to federalism, is it plausible that Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole would have fought so hard to send billions of dollars with few conditions over the next seven years to Ann Richards or Mario Cuomo to run Medicaid, welfare, and other programs? Liberal governors would have gladly spent the money, then denounced Republican policies for ending entitlements. And a conservative party would have been irresponsible to hand billions in unrestricted federal dollars to its political enemies, who could use the money to hire Democratic precinct workers and build political machines to destroy Republican congressmen and senators. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The historic shift was not just a matter of <I>more</i> Republican governors. The high quality of these governors was also critical. A conservative Congress would have been rightly wary of handing power and money over to yesteryear's generation of Republicans -- including Nelson Rockefeller of New York, Bob Ray of Iowa, Bill Milliken of Michigan, and James Rhodes of Ohio-whose records on spending, taxes, and the role of government were indistinguishable from that of Cuomo or Richards. Newt Gingrich is to Bob Michel as Michigan's John Engler is to Milliken, as New York's George Pataki is to Rockefeller. This profound ideological shift among governors and state legislators has occurred in more than 25 states.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The emergence of conservative Republican leadership simultaneously at the national and state levels was no coincidence. In the 1980s, Newt Gingrich learned from John Engler, then majority leader of the Michigan state senate, that many state legislators drove to attend legislative sessions. By sending them Republican audio tapes to listen to on these drives, Gingrich began to coordinate a conservative political message across the nation. The reforms that Engler and Tommy Thompson later pushed through their respective legislatures revealed what Republican governance could achieve. Their ideas for welfare reform, which predated the 1994 election, served as a national model for Republicans. The press attacked Engler savagely for ending general welfare for some 80,000 able-bodied men. But his recovery and the victories of Republican state senators running only six months later proved again that voters value effective policy over partisan polemics.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Washington, political reform has been frustrated by a recalcitrant Senate and Bill Clinton's veto pen. Of the Contract With America's 10 specific items, Congress has passed only the line-item veto, procedural reforms in the House of Representatives, and the Congressional Accountability Act, which brings Congress somewhat under the same laws it imposes upon business. The House has passed the Balanced Budget Amendment, regulatory reform, and other legislation, only to see them watered down or stopped in the Senate. Bill Clinton has twice vetoed welfare reform, and a relatively narrow tort-reform bill was passed over his veto.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the meantime, the states have not stood still. The new generation of Republican governors and state legislators is advancing the Republican reform agenda -- from tax cuts to tort reform. Here are a few of the critical issues raised by the Contract With America and addressed by the states. They provide a blueprint for future work in Washington:<p><b>Taxes</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1993, Clinton campaign strategist James Carville announced that the off-year governor's race in New Jersey between incumbent Democrat Jim Florio -- who had raised taxes in 1989 -- and his challenger Christine Todd Whitman -- who called for a 30 percent across-the-board income-tax cut -- would be the burial ground of Republican advocacy of tax reduction.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Carville misidentified the cadaver. Whitman made the last month of the campaign a clear referendum on her tax-cut proposals, and it worked. Whitman's victory was critical in ensuring that tax cuts would be prominent in the Contract With America a year later.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, while Republicans in Congress were debating a $500-per-child tax credit and cutting the capital-gains tax in half, 17 states with Republican governors cut taxes. In addition, Bill Weld in Massachusetts and Kirk Fordice in Mississippi pushed for tax cuts but faced overwhelming opposition by Democratic legislatures. Arizona governor Fife Symington won an income-tax reduction of $130 million in 1994 and $200 million in 1995, and plans to phase out the income tax over the next four years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And in New Hampshire, Governor Steve Merrill demonstrated that taking the no-income-tax pledge remains a powerful campaign weapon and effective tool for governing. The Taxpayer-Protection Pledge -- made famous when George Bush won the Republican nomination and presidency because he took the pledge and then lost re-election when he broke it -- was born in New Hampshire in 1972. Since then, no one who has not taken the pledge has ever won the governorship of the state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the 1994 elections, Merrill had the happy idea of extending the pledge against a sales or income tax increase to the campaigns for the state senate. Before the election, there were 13 Republicans in the state senate and 11 Democrats. Merrill led a slate of 23 Republicans who took the pledge as a team (foreshadowing the Contract With America); as a result, the Republicans seized 18 of 25 state senate seats and drove from office two Republicans known in New Hampshire as RINOs, or Republicans in Name Only, who had voted with the other party. In 1996, all 395 members of New Hampshire's house of representatives will be asked to take the pledge, separating the RINOs from the Merrill low-tax Republicans. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Taxpayer activists in 40 states are now pushing state legislators, governors, and candidates for those offices to take a state taxpayer-protection pledge. Mike Foster won the governorship of Louisiana as a pledge-taker, and Alabama's Fob James signed the pledge in early 1996 to highlight his consistent opposition to tax increases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This state emphasis on holding down taxes has already produced results. In Kansas, Governor Bill Graves passed legislation cutting the automobile tax in half over five years and repealing a 2.5 percent sales tax on labor used in new construction and on utilities used in manufacturing. Graves also enacted a two-year moratorium on the collection of unemployment taxes from many Kansas businesses, saving them nearly $275 million. Iowa governor Terry Branstad is pushing legislation to phase out over six years the property tax on machinery and equipment, which is now taxed at 30 percent of its original cost. In New Hampshire, Merrill reduced the tax rate on business profits to its lowest level in 14 years, cut the telecommunications tax and the real estate tax, and abolished the savings-bank tax and the corporate-franchise tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Massachusetts, Bill Weld has achieved nine tax cuts, including the abolition of the inheritance tax, a rollback of Michael Dukakis's increases in income taxes and sales taxes and-despite an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature -- a cut in the capital-gains tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Weld's position on taxes illuminates the national debate over the flat tax. Massachusetts's constitution requires a single income-tax rate, now set at 5.95 percent. In 1994, the public-employee unions financed an initiative campaign to repeal this tax provision and establish a graduated, or "progressive," income tax. Weld and Citizens for Limited Taxation defeated the campaign, pointing out that a multiple-rate system allows politicians to separate voters into income groups and play them against each other.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On April 15, 1996, and again on April 15, 1997, the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on a constitutional amendment to require a two-thirds supermajority vote for any federal tax increase. This idea, too, is drawn from the states. The two-thirds supermajority was part of California's Proposition 13 in 1978, and in 1994, Fife Symington and Arizona taxpayer groups backed a successful ballot initiative that amended the state constitution to require a two-thirds vote of the legislature for tax hikes.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal and state constitutions require supermajorities for any legislative actions that depend on widespread support for their legitimacy (like overriding vetoes). Tax increases also demand that level of scrutiny. Taxpayer activists in Arizona are now circulating another initiative to require a two-thirds supermajority for any tax hike approved by the voters directly. They fear that public-employee unions will swamp low-turnout elections and force local or state tax hikes. George Voinovich in Ohio is working with taxpayer advocates on a ballot proposal to require a two-thirds supermajority vote for major tax hikes. Just as term limits swept through 23 states and became part of the Contract With America, the drive for supermajority requirements for tax increases has also been moving on parallel paths at the national and state level.<p><b>School Choice</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Washington, Republicans tried to provide parental choice in education for several thousand of the poorest families in Washington, D.C. Led by Republican congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, the House of Representatives approved the measure in the 1996 appropriations bill for the District. But as of March, the measure was stymied in the Senate by a Democratic filibuster.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As with many issues, parental choice in education reached the national political agenda via the states. Tommy Thompson led the way in 1990 with a model school-choice program for poor Milwaukee parents. More than 1,000 children have qualified to receive vouchers for tuition at secular private schools. The teachers unions maintained that only public schools could provide good education, but studies have shown that Milwaukee public schools suffer a 79 percent attendance rate and a 48 percent graduation rate. By comparison, the city's private schools boast rates of 96 percent and 88 percent respectively.Growing public support for school choice led Thompson to sign legislation last July that expanded the number of eligible children to 7,000 in the current school year and to 15,000 next year. This expanded program -- now being challenged in court -- would give parents the freedom to send their children to parochial or other religious schools. Pending a court decision, the Bradley Foundation and other private funders are financing vouchers for low-income students accepted to private schools.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Ridge put school choice at the top of his agenda. Although Republicans controlled both houses of the legislature, the governor's KID I program failed last year by six votes. Ridge returned last fall with a more modest program to provide $132 million for scholarships for as many as 50,000 students. To reassure skeptics, this version was designed to expire if not reauthorized and was limited to certain cities and counties. Ridge also added a provision ensuring that no school district in Pennsylvania would lose money as a result of school choice. As of this writing, the legislature has once more refused to follow the governor's lead, but key legislators vow that the battle is far from over.In Minnesota, Governor Arne Carlson wants to provide 65,000 low-income students in Minneapolis-St. Paul and a rural district yet to be named with vouchers of up to $3,000, valid at any school. Governor Carlson does not yet have a Republican majority in both houses, but is moving school choice forward by organizing a Republican Task Force for School Choice to put political muscle behind his vision.By promoting school choice, Carlson unites economic conservatives in the business community --who know that school choice will reduce education costs and raise the quality of high-school graduates -- with social conservatives who want parents, rather than bureaucrats, to control their children's education.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Arizona last year, Governor Fife Symington backed a statewide school-choice plan to give all Arizona students up to $1,500 to attend any private school of their choice. Many national figures in the GOP lobbied legislators on behalf of Symington's platform, yet the measure fell three votes short in the state senate, thanks to a handful of Republicans with ties to the National Education Association.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In California, teachers unions  spent $15 million of their members' dues in the fall of 1993 to defeat a school-choice ballot initiative. In his 1996 State of the State address, however, Governor Pete Wilson endorsed a targeted pilot program for school choice. Wilson's proposal would provide 250,000 children in the poorest 5 percent of California's public schools with up to $4,500 each to attend the public, private, or religious school of their choice. Connecticut's Governor John Rowland is also supporting a pilot school-choice program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Massachusetts, Michigan, and Arizona have all embarked on extensive charter-school programs, allowing individuals and teachers to create their own public schools, free of many existing regulations. While charter schools are not school choice, they do offer a real opportunity for many teachers and students to scale the wall the NEA has erected to keep "its" children from escaping bad schools.<p><b>Tort Reform</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, 12 Republican governors took on one of the fiercest Democratic special-interest groups -- the trial lawyers -- and won. While Congress was only able to enact a very limited reform of frivolous stockholder lawsuits, Republican governors made significant strides. Walter Olson, the author of <I>The Litigation Explosion</I>, cites tort-reform initiatives by George Bush Jr. in Texas and Jim Edgar in Illinois as two of the most far-reaching.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Texas now limits punitive damages, requires "clear and convincing" evidence to prove malice, raises the qualifications for expert witnesses, and eliminates joint liability for defendants less than 51 percent at fault.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new Illinois law bars any plaintiff found to be more than 50 percent at fault from recovering damages (which should stop drunks from suing after falling in front of trains), prohibits punitive-damage awards except where defendants behave "with an evil motive or with a reckless indifference to the rights of others," abolishes joint liability for economic and noneconomic damages (thus protecting "deep pocket" defendants from the liability of others), and provides the stiffest reform of product liability in the nation. The Illinois law also protects landowners from being sued by trespassers in most cases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	North Dakota governor Edward T. Schafer passed a product-liability reform package aimed at luring airplane manufacturers to North Dakota. Schafer has pointed out that states need not compete for business by offering subsidies or special tax breaks; instead, they can all lower regulatory and liability costs, and everyone wins.<p><b>Crime</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The latest Republican anti-crime agenda has made little headway in Washington, where the Senate has failed to act on a package of bills passed by the House. Meanwhile, Republican governors led the way in enacting "truth-in-sentencing" laws that require violent criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences, with time off for good behavior but not parole. Governor Fob James of Alabama reintroduced chain gangs -- although the new chains are made of sturdy plastic. He also instituted work and education requirements for inmates to earn television and recreation privileges and banned inmate access to pornography. Mississippi's Kirk Fordice has reestablished the state prison farm, and taken a thousand television sets away from prisoners. Under Pete Wilson, California has carried out its first two executions in 25 years. In New York, after 19 vetoes by Mario Cuomo, Governor George Pataki signed legislation restoring the death penalty and honored Oklahoma's extradition request for murderer Thomas Grasso, who was subsequently executed for murder. Connecticut's John Rowland restored the death penalty there.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bucking the pro-gun control trend in Washington, D.C., that as recently as the fall of 1993 saw the "Brady Bill" passed and the so-called assault-weapon ban included in Bill Clinton's "crime" bill, 28 states have passed "concealed-carry" laws that require local officials to grant licenses to qualified adults who wish to carry concealed handguns. Ten states passed concealed-carry laws in 1995, including Oklahoma, which did not blink at liberal efforts to blame gun owners, taxpayers, and/or radio talk show hosts for the terrorist bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City. Mike Foster, Louisiana's new Republican governor, campaigned on a commitment to sign a concealed-carry law that his Democratic predecessor had vetoed. Ohio, too, with its new Republican majorities, has the votes to pass a concealed-carry law.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Crime is always a thorny issue for Republicans in Washington, caught between their federalist belief in local responsibility for law enforcement and public pressure for federal action on crime. The success of Republicans at the state level at implementing tough anti-crime measures has the added benefit of taking national Republicans off the hook.<p><b>Welfare</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although Bill Clinton has vetoed the Republican welfare-reform bill (which embodies concepts that he once embraced), Republican governors continue to experiment with efforts to free individuals from the dependency of welfare. Tommy Thompson began a series of reforms in 1987 that have reduced Wisconsin's welfare caseload by 32 percent while welfare rolls nationwide were increasing by 25 percent. Pete Wilson suspended cost-of-living adjustments for welfare payments, saving taxpayers $6.3 billion over the past four years and keeping welfare costs 27 percent below where they would otherwise have been.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fife Symington has cut Arizona welfare rolls by 10 percent. His new "Empower" welfare reform limits able-bodied recipients to no more than 24 months of welfare benefits in a five-year period, ends additional payments for welfare recipients who have additional children, and requires minors to live at home to receive any benefits. Between 1992 and 1995, George Voinovich phased out Ohio's generous general-assistance program, which was paying benefits to 142,000 able-bodied Buckeyes. Bill Weld has pushed a series of reforms that have reduced the Massachusetts welfare caseload for 25 straight months. Almost every Republican governor has passed, introduced, or requested a federal waiver for welfare reform in their state. New Hampshire alone has requested 65 waivers from federal welfare requirements. Faced with a stone wall in Washington, Steve Merrill is now prepared to institute his reforms anyway.Spending Restraint
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The conflict between Congress and the president over the size and cost of government has already shut down the federal government repeatedly. This fight has played itself out in the states as well. Steve Merrill had to fight his own Republican legislature to lower spending, and finally won a budget lower than that passed by either chamber of the legislature. Merrill's veto of legislation that would have doubled state aid to education was upheld. Merrill, George Pataki of New York, and Bill Weld of Massachusetts are the only three governors who have actually shrunk their budgets since the previous year.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Ohio, George Voinovich won legislation eliminating two state cabinet agencies. He plans to privatize 78 state liquor stores, saving Ohio taxpayers $20 million annually. Cabinet agencies under the governor's control had 3,162 fewer employees in 1995 than in 1991, a reduction of 8.3 percent. Pete Wilson is asking for an amendment to the California constitution requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote for any new and costly regulation. Kansas governor Bill Graves enacted a six-month moratorium on new government regulations, and then eliminated 530 obsolete rules.<p><b>Medical Savings Accounts</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This centerpiece of the Republican reform of Medicare was blocked by Clinton's veto pen, but in 1995, five Republican governors (Fife Symington, Kirk Fordice, Jim Edgar, John Engler, and Idaho's Philip Batt) shepherded medical savings accounts through their state legislatures. These forays into market-based health care will have a significant effect on overall medical costs and insurance premiums, contributing substantially to the debate in Washington, and perhaps eventually ending the impasse. And, when Congress does finally enact reforms in Medicare, the states will already have in place the mechanisms to take full advantage of it.<p><b>Property Rights</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In March 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation recognizing that the Takings Clause of the Constitution is invoked when government actions destroy or reduce the value of private property, not just when the property is physically occupied by government. That legislation has not seen final action, of course. The pressures that produced it are growing throughout the country, however, and governors and state legislatures are responding to them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beginning in 1992, the states began passing legislation protecting the property rights of their citizens. To date, 23 states have enacted legislation of varying strength, and more efforts are under way. Most of these involve some form of compensation for land values affected by state restrictions on its use. In 1995, every state but Kentucky and Georgia was considering some form of property-rights legislation.<p><b>Color-Blind Society</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	California and Pete Wilson give a textbook example of how a state can force action that has been avoided for decades at the national level. Citizens have filed an initiative petition in California, the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), that would prohibit the state from discriminating based on race or sex. It is a ban on racial preferences or quotas. For two decades, Washington politicians were able to say "I oppose quotas, but favor affirmative action," while supporting laws and court decisions that require racial preferences and quotas. The California initiative may force all national politicians, during an election year, to answer the following questions: "Are you for or against the CCRI as written?" They could no longer fudge or evade discussions of affirmative action.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, a dozen other states are considering measures similar to the California initiative. And on January 15, 1996 -- Martin Luther King Day --the newly elected Louisiana governor, Mike Foster, issued an executive order abolishing all racial preferences as abhorrent to King's vision of a color-blind society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a result, Republican leaders in the Congress have all stated their opposition to quotas and racial preferences. Bob Dole and Representative Charles Canady have introduced federal legislation mirroring California's. Black congressman Gary Franks, a Connecticut Republican was ready to push an amendment to an appropriations bill immediately eliminating contract set-asides for minorities. House leaders persuaded him to postpone it, but this is clearly an issue that will continue to surface at the federal level. There could hardly be a clearer example of state politics forcing an unwanted issue onto the Washington agenda.<p><b>Federalism</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Alabama governor Fob James took his oath of office standing under a banner carrying the words of the Tenth Amendment: "The Powers not delegated to the United States nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Texas Governor George W. Bush has made a mantra of his call to "let Texans run Texas." Arizona's Fife Symington forced the federal government to reopen the Grand Canyon by threatening to operate it with state workers. He has since called on the federal government to cede control of the Grand Canyon to his state, and is working with Newt Gingrich to speed a transfer of power. Symington has also socked away $1 million to finance lawsuits that may be necessary to defend the state's Tenth Amendment rights.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Utah Governor Mike Leavitt has begun to organize a national movement to promote an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would give states the right to block national laws passed by Congress that violate their autonomy. For instance, two-thirds of the governors or perhaps two-thirds of state legislatures would have the power to overturn a federal law by passing resolutions of disapproval. As with a presidential veto, a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress would reinstate the law.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It may not be necessary to wait for an amendment. Leavitt is trying to get a commitment from Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole that they will force a second vote on any law or part of a law that draws written opposition from two-thirds of the governors. That would give America an opportunity to get used to the way the amendment would operate.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some commentators ask which of the Republican governors is the best or most effective. In fact, the breadth of quality and activism is amazing. Certainly, John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin were early revolutionaries. Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Kirk Fordice of Mississippi demonstrated how much one can accomplish in the face of overwhelming Democratic legislatures. Arne Carlson of Minnesota and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania have bravely challenged the teachers unions in their states, and George Bush of Texas and Jim Edgar of Illinois have taken on the trial-lawyer beast.	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All the Republican governors are traveling in the same direction and showing real courage in tackling the special interests of the old establishment order. This is important in each state, but it is also critical nationally. Republican governors and state legislators are to the new Republican majority in Congress and any future Republican president what the labor unions and corrupt big-city machines are to the Democratic Party: its nationwide infrastructure. They are a second front arrayed against the liberal welfare state. In the last five years -- and most intensely in 1995 -- they have followed Lenin's advice to probe with bayonets, looking for weaknesses. Their triumphs guarantee the ultimate success of the Gingrich Revolution-no matter what happens in Washington.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I><b>Grover Norquist</b> is the president of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a> and the national political correspondent for the</I> American Spectator.

<h2>In Welfare Reform, Governors Miss the Point</h2>
<b>by Robert Rector</b>
</center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Congress is now considering a welfare-reform plan recently proposed by the nation's governors. Unfortunately, this plan ignores America's biggest social problem: the catastrophic rise of illegitimacy. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly a third of the children born in America last year were born out of wedlock. The illegitimacy rate is rising by a percentage point every year. And among blacks the out-of-wedlock birthrate has reached 69 percent. This figure astounds even New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who warned us in the early 1960s of the threat posed to the black community by the collapse of marriage. Moynihan's admonition was dismissed then, but the breakup of the black family and the calamities that have accompanied it are outstripping his most frightful predictions. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Ominously, the illegitimacy rate for whites is now edging toward 25 percent, almost exactly the rate for blacks when Moynihan first sounded his alarm. The white family now faces the same breakdown that has devastated black communities in the last 30 years. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Family collapse is the root cause of a host of social problems, including poverty, crime, drug abuse, and academic underachievement. Children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than children born to couples who are married. Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out of wedlock than girls from intact, independent families. And a boy from a single-parent household in the inner city is twice as likely to become involved in crime as a similarly poor boy who lives with a father and a mother.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nation's governors have responded to this grim reality by ignoring it. In unveiling their welfare reform plan, they have declared that there are three "key elements" to real welfare reform: (1) providing more government-funded day care; (2) increasing child support payments from absent fathers; (3) imposing time limits and work requirements on welfare recipients. Rising illegitimacy and the collapse of marriage do not receive even passing comment. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This plan represents a radical shift in the focus of the welfare debate -- from combating illegitimacy to providing public-support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Dodging the illegitimacy issue entirely, the governors' plan promises a future in which marriage collapses further and the government must meet the needs of a burgeoning population of single-parent families. The triumph of the Left is complete: Fighting illegitimacy is "out," and funding government-run day care is "in."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some argue that federal action on illegitimacy is not needed, that the governors will tackle the problem. But the governors' silence speaks volumes. Few have made reducing illegitimacy a priority; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. But by refusing to acknowledge the dangers of collapsing marriages and rising illegitimacy, they implicitly condone and ultimately promote illegitimacy. The result: Soon, half of all American children will be born out of wedlock and reared in government-run day-care centers. This is not reform -- this is a national disaster.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The governors' plan borrows heavily from the "reform" schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals. It also dovetails with the interests of America's huge welfare bureaucracy, which thrives on social decay. Although the plan will trim the growth rate of welfare spending slightly in the near term, it will lead to an explosion in welfare and social-service spending. In other words, we will have to pay the price for illegitimacy sooner or later.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress seems too willing to join the governors in ignoring illegitimacy. Under recent legislation, Congress will spend nearly a half trillion dollars over the next seven years to subsidize illegitimacy through welfare benefits, day care, job training, and other services. For every dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy, the federal government will spend about a thousand dollars on programs that contribute to it.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Marriage in America is dying, and the governors have prepared the coffin. Many in Congress seem willing to serve as pall bearers. But "welfare reform" is nonsense so long as the illegitimacy rate continues to rise. Vision and leadership are sorely needed -- and the governors especially seem unable to provide either.<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
discusses a critical issue which is sweeping our country, making 
headlines nationwide, and causing a stir in American families:  the 
possible redefining of marriage to include homosexual unions.

<p>

We will be talking to Robert Knight of the Family Research Council, 
who has thoroughly researched the homosexual activist movement and their 
attempts to dramatically change family life as we know it. And we will
also bring you Anthony Falzarano, who, as a former homosexual,
knows well the inside story on homosexual culture and the attempts
to increase its influence by changing our laws.  These attempts
to redefine marriage will affect all of us, from the filing of
our taxes to our schools, to our workplaces, and beyond.  You
need to understand this phenomenon.

<p>

But first, let's hear from the Family Research Council's president, 
Gary Bauer.  Yesterday, Gary and I talked about a pivotal decision which 
may be made this very evening by President Clinton, whether to veto the 
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act or to align himself with the majority of
Americans and majority of House and Senate members, who have clearly
stated that they strongly support the lifesaving act.

You will hear a lot of stories on this veto, but first, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> will take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thanks so much for being with us today.

<p>

Just last week, on Good Friday, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act
was finally sent to the President.  It was passed overwhelmingly
in both the House and the Senate.  It is a piece of legislation
that deals with a procedure in which the child is delivered into
the birth canal; moments from birth, a scissors stabbed into the
base of his skull; living brain tissue suctioned out; and this
is an abortion procedure that would be banned except to save the
life of the mother.

<p>

The President has been very clear that he intends to veto this bill. 
What do you think this says about the state of the abortion debate 
today?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  We probably should have given a disclaimer to the viewer 
who might not have wanted to hear that description.  It's incredible 
to think that in America we are actually aborting babies in the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth month of pregnancy using that procedure.

<p>

The country is deeply divided over abortion.  We all know that, Kristi. 
But every poll that I have seen shows that the American people 
overwhelmingly find this procedure to be reprehensible, to be grotesque; 
in fact, most Americans react in disbelief when they hear that it is 
something that goes on in clinics today.

<p>

So, for me, to hear the President of the United States say basically 
that he is going to fall on his sword over this; that he is so committed 
to abortion on demand that even these third-trimester abortions will 
continue under his Presidency is something that, in my mind, makes him 
an extremist on this issue.  I just don't know any other way to describe 
it. And it just seems sort of unusual, because he has really tried
in the last year or so to picture himself as being middle-of-the-road,
and I think he has been quite convincing with some Americans.

<p>

But here is an issue that gets past the rhetoric, goes right to
the heart of the debate in America about our liberty and how it
should be used, and the President has made it clear he is going
to stand with the National Organization for Women and the radicals
on this issue, and I think it is going to hurt him politically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  One of the interesting things about this particular
abortion debate was that people who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their entire history voted for this particular ban.  What
do you think this says about the President's statement and his
advisors' statements that this particular abortion bill will work
for him?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I don't know.  You know, the White
House does polling every night.  It is the first White House in
American history to do that, so you would expect them to have
a finely tuned sense of American public opinion.  I can't imagine
how in the world this issue would work for him, and quite frankly,
on an issue involving life and death, I would hope politicians
of all stripes would stop looking at these issues about what helps
them and what hurts them and start making judgments that are filled
with some sense of compassion and some sense of the sanctity of
life.  It just seems amazing to me that anyone would try to make
a political calculation over something this important.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, this bill does deal with the life-of-the-mother 
exception. If this procedure would be needed to save the mother's 
life, it would be available, but not for some of the other reasons,
not for elective abortion, for example.

<p>

This is the first time since <i>Roe v. Wade</i> that any abortion 
restriction at all has been made possible.  Why do you think that 
there has been a kind of restriction available now?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, when you really think about it, people say 
that we have been debating abortion too much. Actually, we really 
don't as a society get to debate it really at all in any meaningful 
sense of the word.  The courts have driven this issue for over 20 
years, and no matter where you stand on the issue, the courts have had 
the trump cards. They keep throwing down their aces and stopping the 
American people from doing much about abortion one way or the other. 

<p>

This was the first time in a long, long time that the Congress of the 
United States actually had a real bill dealing with a real abortion 
issue that they had to debate and then vote on the record about.  I
think that is the important thing here.  These politicians in
the Congress knew that the whole country would see their vote
and would be able to ponder the meaning of those votes, and I
think that is why the final vote was so overwhelming.

<p>

Every once in a while, I tune in to C-SPAN that often will allow 
callers to comment on what is going on on the floor of the Congress, 
and what struck me was the just almost endless numbers of calls coming
in from people who would say, &quot;I'm pro-choice, but I can't
possibly support something like this.&quot;

<p>

So I think that is why this vote was so significant, and I think it 
reflects where the American people are on the abortion issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, you pointed out to me a poll out just this week 
which indicates that the majority of Americans in fact are actually 
pro-life or leaning toward pro-life.  What do the numbers tell us 
about people's sentiments toward abortions?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Yes, this is an area where there is great misunderstanding. 
The media generally says almost without question that Americans are 
&quot;pro-choice,&quot; which generally is interpreted to mean they 
favor abortion on demand.

<p>

What the polling data has shown for over 25 years and continues to 
show in 1996 is that about one-third of the country believes that 
abortion should be unrestricted totally. The other two-thirds of 
the country either wants abortion severely restricted
or doesn't want any abortions at all.  So to the extent that there
is a consensus in America, it is much more toward the pro-life
side.

<p>

Now, people get confused about what words like &quot;pro-choice&quot;
mean. That's why I always look at polls that get very specific:
Would you be in favor of abortion in this case or that case?
And when you ask that kind of question, it is clear that Americans,
two to one, take a generally pro-life position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This particular debate has been surrounded by a lot of 
powerful symbolism, first-time symbolism.  For example, the leaders of
the Catholic Church in America met in the park outside the White
House in pouring rain to pray and to ask the President not to
veto this particular bill.

<p>

Politically speaking, how do you think American Catholics will 
respond to a veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think that what happened outside the White 
House just a few days ago was an incredible moral statement by the 
church that on this issue they would stand up to the President, 
even though they have some issues that they are in agreement with 
him on.

<p>

I think the interesting thing will be what will the average American 
Catholic -- and, for that matter, the average American evangelical -- 
do when they go to the voting booth in November on this kind of issue. 
There are a lot of issues that voters weigh, but presumably, men and 
women of faith are going to weigh issues that go directly to their 
faith first and foremost when they vote.

<p>

And so I think the President does run the risk of losing a lot of 
evangelical and Catholic votes if he follows through with his threat 
to veto this bill.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think, Gary, that President Clinton will veto 
this bill, or is it possible that he might change his mind?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think that the signals over the last couple of weeks 
have been so clear and so pronounced that he almost would look foolish 
at this point. He really has backed himself into a corner.

<p>

The other thing is, there are some very important groups that the 
President has to have the support of, some of the radical feminist 
groups, groups like Planned Parenthood, the National Organization for
Women, and so forth.  These groups are important parts of the
liberal coalition in the United States, and I think the President
is afraid that if he vetoes the bill, he will get criticism from
groups he is going to be counting on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The pro-life story can be put up against the Unabomber 
story right now, ironically enough. We have seen some very unfortunate 
and horrible shootings at abortion clinics and, after 30 peaceful years, 
an attempt to smear a lot of pro-life Americans, saying that these shooters
are representative; and then a man who by news accounts is a radical
environmentalist bombs quite a few people and in fact was involved,
they say, with Earth First, even killing people on an Earth First
hit list.

<p>

It has been interesting the way in which these two stories
have been handled and how people on both sides have been characterized.
What is your take on the way these pro-life and environmentalist
issues have been played?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, there clearly is a double standard, but first of all, 
let's make clear that everybody understands that we condemn, obviously, 
the abortion clinic shootings. Those have been terrible, terrible events, 
and the people responsible for them ought to be punished and sentenced 
to the full extent of the law.

<p>

What has been unfortunate, however, is the effort
of the pro-abortion side to take these incidents and blame them
or try to hang them on everyone who is pro-life.  I travel all
around the country, and I see tens of thousands of people sacrificing
financially and otherwise to help women in crisis pregnancy.
You've got crisis pregnancy clinics all over the country.  These
abortion murderers don't represent the pro-life movement.

<p>

But as you point out, here we have the Unabomber, who appears to be
an environmentalist, a radical environmentalist, associated in
some way with the group Earth First -- more investigation will
have to be done about that -- and yet the media is generally silent
about that connection.  The same media that wants to try to hang
a deranged killer at an abortion clinic and use him to smear the
whole pro-life movement is relatively silent when it comes to
using the Unabomber to raise questions about whether radical 
environmentalism has gone too far.

<p>

So I guess I would just ask that the standards be the same here. If 
pro-life rhetoric can be held to be responsible for a deranged 
individual, then I don't see how radical pro-environmental
rhetoric can't be held to the same standard when it comes to somebody
like the man that has been alleged to do these bombings.  Clearly,
the liberal bias of the media comes through time and time again,
and it is certainly pronounced in this case.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One last question, Gary.  As you know, President Clinton 
has tended to veto pro-life measures or to deal with abortion-related 
bills in the dead of night or on the weekend or sometimes in the middle
of, even once, a bombing that the United States was involved with.

<p>

What is your analysis on when this particular Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act will be handled?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think the best prediction is that it will happen late 
on a Friday when most of the media is already focused on other things, 
or it will happen on a day when there is big news someplace else, 
either foreign policy news and so forth.

<p>

This White House has shown a very clear pattern
of doing things it doesn't want the public to focus on at times
when the media is not going to be watching very closely, and I
suspect the same thing will happen on this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, Gary, for being with us.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Thank you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will begin our
discussion regarding same-sex marriage and how it could dramatically
influence society both today and forever.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as
the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband
or wife, one woman and one man.  As basic and familiar as the
definition may sound, the literal and fundamental meaning of marriage
may undergo a drastic change if homosexual activists have their
way.  Currently across the nation, the battle to redefine marriage
and family is being waged.  Studies, statistics, and basic common
sense tell us that marriage between a man and a woman stabilizes
sexuality and provides the best environment in which to procreate
and raise children.  This has been found true both in research
and in all of recorded history.  The family, based on a committed
man and woman, exists as the foundation of society before recorded
time.

<p>

Yet homosexual activists seek to legitimize their relationships
by forcing acceptance of same-sex couples under the law.  It has
become clear that the mere tolerance of homosexual relationships
is no longer enough.

<p>

Some may question whether the decision to allow same-sex marriage 
would really do that much damage.  But those people may want to ask 
themselves whether they are willing to have businesses required to 
have family health benefits for homosexual couples, to have their 
children taught in school that homosexual sex is the moral equivalent 
of marital love, and to endorse adoption of children by homosexual 
couples.

<p>

Marriage has been revered and protected throughout the world because 
that specific and special relationship benefitted not only the people in 
them but the societies as well.  Legally destroying the exclusive territory
of marriage to achieve a political end will not provide the real
benefits of marriage to homosexuals, but it may be the blow that
the shattered American family does not survive.

<p>

To help us understand just how much a decision to redefine marriage to 
include same-sex relationships could change all of society, I am joined 
by two special guests:  Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for
the Family Research Council, who has been one of the most influential
pro-family leaders in bringing this issue to light in research
and analysis; and Anthony Falzarano, Executive Director of Transformations
Ex-Gay Ministry, who works daily with men and women trying to
free themselves from the gay lifestyle.  Both are the most eloquent
experts on these issues today.

<p>

Welcome to the show.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Great to be here.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for the introduction, too.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You're welcome.  Most of the time you're one amongst
many anti; it is only fair that you're acknowledged for the 
contributions that you both have made.

<p>

I wanted to start -- as I talk about this issue, as you all both 
do very eloquently, so many people do not understand why we should 
care.  You know, look, they're already out there. There are already 
homosexuals and lesbians in relationships.  So they have a marriage 
ceremony.  What does it hurt?  And I ask you, what does it hurt?

<p>

Bob, I will start with you, and then Anthony.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, a lot of people don't realize that what they're 
seeking is not so much acceptance for individual relationships as a 
larger goal, which is acceptance within the law, which forces it on 
everybody else.

<p>

See, when you have a couple homosexuals who say, &quot;Well, we want to
commit to ourselves,&quot; and then they go have a ceremony, they've
got that right in this country.  It's a free country.  But when
they bring the law into it, they bring us all into it.  They tell
us all that this marriage license is now the same as mom and dad
over here, and that cheapens mom and dad's marriage license, because
suddenly that marriage, the word &quot;marriage&quot; doesn't
mean what it used to mean.  It's not a very specific, defined
thing.

<p>

When you do that, when you bring a counterfeit version
in, that hurts the original.  It hurts support for the original
within the law.  People have worked very hard over the years to
support marriage within the law by setting aside specific benefits
for it, protections.  You know, spouses can't testify against
each other in trials, and all kinds of things.

<p>

Support for these kinds of special set-asides would erode if the 
institution itself suddenly ceases to be that special man-woman 
unique relationship that is the heart of civilization.

<p>

We can't do without it, and that's the bottom line.  The state knows 
that. Even if the state didn't believe that any religion was valid -- 
Christianity, Judaism, Islam, anything -- they would still support 
marriage because it has such a wide array of social benefits.  There 
is no society on Earth that has functioned without marriage, and there 
are many that have gone into the dust bin of history as soon as they 
cheapened marriage:  Rome, Greece, some of the middle Chinese dynasties.
When marriage became cheapened, the social fabric began to unravel.

<p>

And we're seeing that in this country.  We have already cheapened
marriage with easy divorce.  We have prenuptial agreements, we
have people living together.  It has already hurt marriage.  But
this would be the final blow, to say that it doesn't even have
to be a man and a woman.  It could be two guys.  And if you're
at that point, why not three guys or four guys?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are so many interesting countervailing trends right 
now. You have a move to get rid of no-fault divorce because we say
divorce has unraveled our society.  You have men's movements saying
we need fathers involved with their children.  And then you have
this whole homosexual activist movement saying, Oh, all of that
is null and void; we really just need to expand and have it mean
even less than it does today.

<p>

Anthony, you understand this very well.  Why do you think it matters 
whether or not we legally change the definition of marriage?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: This is extremely important. I would obviously agree 
with Bob.  Basically, the homosexual, let's say the political gay 
community, is out to destroy the traditional marriage, heterosexual 
marriage, that God has designed for us. God deemed that the male 
would leave his parents and cling onto the female and the two would 
become one.

<p>

Basically, our country was founded on those Judeo-Christian 
values, and God has blessed our country because we have stood for 
those values. But over the last 25 years we have seen an incredible 
deterioration of those values.

<p>

What the gays are up to is, they can't change the church in our 
country.  They can't change the mainline church. They can't change 
the Roman Catholic church.  They can't change the mainline Protestant 
church's view of homosexuality:  it is sinful behavior.

<p>

So, basically, what they started with in 1973 was going to the 
next most important authority, which was the
American Psychological Association, and they pushed homosexuality
out of the <i>APA Journal</i>, and when the APA decided that they would
take homosexuality out of the DSM-III, which is the official digest
of mental illnesses in this country, with that they now had permission
from an authority to go to our Federal Government and go to our
state government and say, &quot;See, these professionals do not
consider this to be a mental illness; therefore, you are discriminating
against us, and you are going to have to give us our rights.&quot;

<p>

And now they are trying to get gay marriage pushed onto our country,
because then they can now go after the church, and they can say,
&quot;Well, the American Psychiatric Association says we're normal,
the Federal Government, the state government says we're normal;
therefore, if you don't start hiring us in that local Catholic
church or that local Protestant church or in that Christian day
school, we're going to sue you, and if you don't conform, the
Federal Government is going to take your 501(c)(3) status away
and is going to take your full tax-exempt status away; therefore,
many of these churches will not be able to survive.&quot;

<p>

It's just like Georgetown University was forced to have a pro-gay group
on their campus, and it's against Catholic teaching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Georgetown, a Catholic University that we have to mention.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  Yes, and they get federal funding from the government.
And if you take that $40 or $50 million away, whatever that figure
is, Georgetown University will be out of business tomorrow.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it is interesting to note not only how accurate
that prediction is for future society but present society.  A
gentleman in Seattle, for example, that called Family Research
Council not too long ago.  He was a business owner, had hired
a gentleman who was a homosexual as an accountant.  They did not
have the business to keep him employed, and so they had to lay
him off, and a suit was filed that it was homosexual discrimination
because this gentleman played Christian music in the business
that he owned.  Because of that, he is fighting an expensive lawsuit
on antidiscrimination grounds saying that his faith is the problem,
and it's an extraordinary case.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Here are some other cases.  Shell Oil Company on the 
West Coast, there was a homosexual higher level executive who used the 
company fax machine and the xerox machine to make fliers advertising a 
gay orgy. You know, it was a very explicit flier.  Well, that's not 
conduct suitable for a high executive at Shell Oil Company, so they fired
him.

<p>

He came back and said, &quot;Well, you fired me because I'm
gay.&quot;  So under California's gay rights law, he sued; he
won millions from Shell Oil Company.

<p>

That's what we're talking about whenever you're talking about gay 
rights. You're talking about giving somebody a gun to put at the head 
of anybody who disagrees with them, whether it's the Boy Scouts, whether 
it's a local dry-cleaning establishment or a giant corporation like
Shell Oil.

<p>

That's another reason we're fighting this whole gay
marriage idea, because when you create something that's immoral,
which gay marriage certainly is, by any stretch, by any religious
value system and tradition, and then you put it into the law,
you make everybody who disagrees a moral outlaw.  You make people
who disagree find themselves the target of civil suits, harassment
at work.

<p>

I just got a call today from a guy who works for a federal
contractor, and he has been fired from his job by a homosexual
supervisor who had been hiring homosexuals, and they found out
he was Christian and harassed him and finally fired him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing. And it's only the beginning.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: It's just the beginning.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  This is only the beginning.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And we're going to have to hear more
about this after the break.  Please join us after the commercial
break as we continue to discuss the homosexual agenda regarding
marriage and family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing the drastic ramifications of 
changing marriage to including same-sex relationships, and I am joined
again by Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family
Research Council, and Anthony Falzarano, Executive Director of
Transformations Ex-Gay Christian Ministries.  Thank you so much
again for being with us.

<p>

There is a lot of activity going on in Hawaii right now, and, Bob, 
we are going to get to you on that in a second, where the law is 
being a frontal attack.

<p>

But, Anthony, one thing that has been interesting to me in a lot of 
the homosexual activist literature is there's this myth out there that 
most homosexual relationships are two men, two women that have been 
together for 30 years and that we're merely going to legalize with this 
change something that is already taking place.  And yet the gay literature
is very clear that not only do they want to call the relationships
marriage; they don't want their marriages to be the same as what
we would call good marriages.  Could you explain that?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Yes.  Well, basically, it is all propaganda.  They cannot 
sell short-term marriages to the American public.  They cannot sell
a marriage where there are three guys living in sin together.
So, basically, they choose, a certain amount of gays -- and there
are a certain percentage that are together in monogamous relationships,
but I can assure you, they are an extreme minimum.  Most homosexuals
are still highly promiscuous, even in the age of AIDS.  And, basically,
they get these people, they look all scrubbed, all American, they
have a house with a white picket fence in Falls Church, Virginia,
and you just think, Wow, they're just wonderful people; how can
we discriminate against these people?  And, basically, they are
pushing this pro-gay agenda onto the American public.  If they
can get --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But the gay literature -- one thing
that has been interesting to me is the gay literature has come
right out and said we can't keep monogamy in our definition of
marriage.  We may have a significant relationship we'll call marriage,
but things like monogamy and fidelity, faithfulness, and lifetime
kind of till-death-do-us-part commitments are a little unrealistic.
So we want it to be marriage, but we don't want it to be monogamous.

<p>

It has been a strange delinking of monogamy.  But why do you think
that has --

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  Well, it's political.  Basically, they want to be 
able to get, if they have a boyfriend and they
work at AT&amp;T, which is a very pro-gay organization right now,
they want to be able to have that boyfriend have insurance benefits.
I mean, you can hook up with a guy who is your friend who has
AIDS and he has no health insurance, and that's very sad, but
in our country he would never be denied health care, but with
certain corporations you're going to get better health care, so
they can claim that they are in a monogamous relationship, and
therefore, you have to extend benefits to my boyfriend.

<p>

I mean, there are a lot of reasons why they are doing this, but what we
really have to focus in on is this is an attack on Judeo-Christian
values in this country.  This is an assault on traditional Judeo-Christian
marriage, and if the American public falls for this and allows
homosexual marriage to be officially recognized in the courts,
you are opening up a whole can of worms.  You are opening up the
insurance industry, the wills.  A lot of times if someone has
--

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Education.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  -- education -- you know, this is my boyfriend. He 
can bring this boyfriend into class and introduce him to 12-year-old 
children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure.

<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's a whole can of worms, and it's so
beautifully packaged by organizations like the Human Rights Campaign
Fund.  I mean, I was on a show with the director of that organization,
and she was quoting -- I don't know where she got her statistics
from, but she was quoting a study that says that America really
is for gay marriage.  And when she started giving off her data,
she said, &quot;Well, in this study, 48 percent are undecided.&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, where are you getting this propaganda from?&quot;
I said, &quot;What kind of study would have credibility where
48 percent of the study is undecided?&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is &quot;I don't know,&quot; right.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  America is against gay marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, yes.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  And, hopefully, they will never accept it, or the 
wrath of God will come upon this country.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, interestingly enough, Hawaii has been the 
spearpoint state for driving gay marriage into the country, and 
yet, apparently, the spear point got a little blunted this week. 
Bob, what happened?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Boy, did it!  Well, it started last week. They released 
the latest poll of Hawaiians, and what had been a 71 percent figure 
opposing same-sex marriage rose to 74 percent.  That was reported 
in the major Honolulu newspapers. The percentage just keeps rising 
as people understand the threat that gay marriage, so called, poses.

<p>

But yesterday there was a major victory in the Senate.  There was a 
bill that went through the Senate unanimously, 24 to nothing, banning 
same-sex marriage, reaffirming the state's commitment to one man-one 
woman marriage, and stating the reasons for it.  This was all done 
because a court case is coming up in Hawaii in a circuit court, sent 
down from the Supreme Court, expected to be heard in August, in which 
three couples have challenged the marriage license law.

<p>

The Supreme Court had told the state of Hawaii, find a compelling 
interest to preserve one man-one woman marriage or we are going to 
open it up to same-sex relationships.

<p>

So now the Senate has moved. Liberal Hawaii, liberal Democrats and 
moderate Republicans and some conservatives, all voting to preserve 
marriage.  That has got to send a signal to the courts, and it should 
send a signal to the rest of America that you don't want this, folks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People don't, I think, understand [that] to redefine 
marriage is to open -- some things we are going to talk about in the 
next segment, adoption of children, to change our educational system,
to say that any kind of sex practice is morally neutral.  Here
we are struggling with rising STD rates and you have a growing
abstinence movement and just plain an attempt to decrease sexually
transmitted diseases among kids and a crippling infertility rate,
and then we are going to say that all sex practices, despite these
horrible figures, the sex that you have is insignificant.

<p>

There are all these strange counter-trends going on, but I think one
of the interesting significances of Hawaii is, if Hawaii, that
one state, changes their law, the rest of the nation is changed.
Bob, could you explain that for the viewers?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Because of the full faith and credit clause of the 
Constitution, states are supposed to recognize licenses from out of 
state, like a driver's license.  If a gay couple from, say, Ohio flies 
to Honolulu, gets married under a brand-new gay marriage law in Hawaii
and goes back to Ohio, they can present their marriage license
and say, &quot;Look, you have to recognize it with all the benefits
and status and privileges it brings.&quot;  That gives Ohio a
huge problem under the full faith and credit clause.  If they
don't recognize it, the gay couple is going to haul them into
court and say, &quot;You're denying us our basic human rights.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Based on the Constitution, even.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Based on the Constitution.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  And what is incredible about
that is that a lot of states are adopting anti-gay marriage laws
right now, but, you see, the gays aren't concerned about that.
They are going to go up to the Supreme Court, which will override
the state laws, and that is what they are really up to, taking
this up to the Supreme Court.  They are assaulting the American
public right now.  They are extremely organized, and if they don't
win in Hawaii, they are going to hit California; they are going
to hit another liberal state; and eventually, they are going to
try to break through.  That is what they are up to.

<p>

If the American public doesn't wise up to this, then evil thrives 
when good men and women do nothing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I can tell you one thing about the --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You're going to have to tell me this after the break, 
because we are going to hear more about this.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> 
returns, we will hear more about how same-sex marriage affects the family 
and America's children.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Legalizing same-sex marriage not only touches the lives of those
involved in the relationships; it also affects America's children
by opening the door to gay adoption and much more.

<p>

To shed light on this, back again are Bob Knight and Anthony Falzarano.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Again.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Are we eloquent still?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Eloquent and continuing to be eloquent.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I wanted to let you wrap up one point before we
get into the real reason why so many of us are fighting this,
which is for today's children.  But why is it, Anthony, homosexuals
and lesbians have made tremendous gains in societies?  I mean,
Hollywood and really in the job and a lot of different settings.
Why do they keep coming?  Why now gay marriage?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I am the director of an ex-gay ministry.  I am a former 
homosexual myself.  I was gay for nine years before I got saved and 
became a Christian and the blood of Jesus Christ washed over me.

<p>

Basically, I had no problem getting an apartment if I made enough money,
just like anybody else.  No one ever turned me down for an apartment.
There are certain gays out there that just want to push into
the landlord's face that I'm a homosexual and you can't keep me
out.

<p>

Basically, homosexuality is a neurosis.  It's healable, it's
treatable.  We are ministering to 6,000 former homosexuals in
the Exodus network.  Basically, homosexuality is a stunting of
psychosexual growth.  They are children inside, and any parents
out there -- you know, when your kid is spoiled, he'll keep coming
at you and keep coming at you and keep coming at you until you
give him a whack on the bottom and say, &quot;Enough!&quot; and
then the child will stop.

<p>

The American public has got to start treating the homosexual community 
in that way. They've got to say, &quot;Enough is enough.  You have 
enough benefits. You can live in your subculture, but please do not 
push this on our Judeo-Christian values.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the reason why they're stunted, I think you need 
to bring that up.  A lot of people were molested; there were some 
serious events in their lives.  We know from psychological
research that powerful and crushing events do stunt growth.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Of course. Eighty percent of the people that have
come to Transformation in Washington have been sexually abused
as children.  Ninety-eight percent of them did not bond with their
same-sex parent.  And, basically, that is the main cause of homosexuality.
And when we treat those symptoms with the love of the Christian
church, people start to recover from homosexuality.

<p>

We see people go on to heterosexual marriage.  We put marriages back 
together. We see people go on to seminary.  These people don't necessarily
want to be gay.  They are being sold a bill of goods by the political
pro-gay factions that are in this country, and we need to get
the word out that you don't have to be gay and that there are
options, and I believe that many homosexuals, if they knew that
they had an option, would take that option to become ex-gay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, one of the things that you have been studying has
been the sexualizing of children and the way in which children
have become a political football.  But they are the real goal
here.

<p>

It was interesting, during the gay march here in Washington,
D.C., one of the constant chants was, &quot;Ten percent is not
enough; recruit, recruit, recruit,&quot; which kind of flies in
the face of their biological argument.

<p>

Why are children the key issue here with the gay marriage debate?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, because when you legitimatize gay marriage, you 
really can't say no to adoption of children in same-sex households, 
because you have destroyed the gender distinction, the idea that men 
and women are different, complementary, have something special to offer
each other and to their children.

<p>

It is kind of the Equal Rights Amendment. It is creeping in through the 
back door saying men and women are interchangeable; there is no 
difference, so let's not make any distinctions at all.  That's what 
it's all about. That's why it's not just live and let live, have a gay 
couple down the street get a marriage license.  It's so much bigger than
that. I think what has not been said often enough is that children
really do need a mother and a father.  A little boy needs to have
a father to learn what it is to be a man and to have his growing
masculinity affirmed, and he needs to have a mother for that mother
love, and to watch both parents interact and see how men should
treat women, women should treat men, how they both treat each
other as husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, and their relationship
with their children.

<p>

In a gay household, these same-sex households that are now adopting 
children, the child immediately doesn't have a father or a mother, 
one or the other, so the kid is already at a disadvantage. Then the 
child sees a distorted view of sexuality because of the homosexuality 
going on, and then that child is intensely curious about what men 
and women do together, what relationships they have.

<p>

I know a guy who has just entered jail, tragically,
because he grew up in a lesbian household.  He still loves his
mother and doesn't really blame her, but he said, &quot;You know,
as a boy in a lesbian environment where it was intensely anti-male&quot;
-- that's all he heard, this bitterness toward men -- he said
that he felt totally disenfranchised, began having sexual problems.
He eventually became a voyeur, and he is in on a peeping Tom
charge.  He was so curious about how normal people have sex. We
have other people that are cases like this.

<p>

One case will not a principle make, but this guy is a symptom, and it 
shows that without a dad in the house to set him straight, he really 
ran into a lot of problems.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  That is right.  There is a case in the Rhode Island 
court system right now.  This poor father called me, and he says, 
&quot;I need help.&quot;  Basically, his wife left him for a woman, 
and basically, there is a custody fight over the two girls, two young 
girls in the family.

<p>

Basically, the judge said to this young father, &quot;Look, I'm not 
concerned if your wife is a lesbian.  I want to find out who is the most
suitable parent to take custody over these children.&quot;  And
he describes how unstable his former wife's girlfriend is, and
to expose two pure young girls to a lesbian relationship -- it's
child abuse, and I can't believe the courts would even consider
giving custody to this woman.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  But if you get same-sex marriage, the courts are going 
to have no choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They'll have no options.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Because marriage is a privilege,
and it's a benefit, and the state really does set a big fence
around it to protect it.  So if the state thinks enough of that
relationship to give it all these special benefits and says this
is okay, you will have no defense against homosexuals saying,
&quot;We want children, too.  We're going to have them, and by
the way, we're going to teach them that homosexuality is okay
in the schools.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But the reason why we benefit [from] marriage is 
because marriages benefit society.  It is not a random social gift. 
People fare better, children fare better.

<p>

I want to thank my guests.  I want to encourage people to call
and write these different organizations for more about this. 
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> will show you some video clips 
highlighting the homosexual marriage and adoption issues. Don't go 
away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council></i>.

<p>

Robert Knight has appeared on many confrontational
television shows, and tonight we will share a couple of those
with you as Bob discussed some same-sex marriage and homosexual
adoption issues.  Let's take a look at clips from ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i> and <i>Oprah</i> as we bring you Homefront News.

<p>

[Segment from ABC <i>Nightline</i>, September 25, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Marriage is the uniting of the two sexes.
That's the definition.  So when homosexuals say, &quot;We want
the right to marry,&quot; they've already got it, but they don't
meet the requirements.  The requirements are --

<p>

MR. KOPPEL: Defined by whom?  Defined by whom?  Requirements as 
defined by whom?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Every major culture on the planet, all major religions. 
I mean, Ted, come on.  You're talking as if marriage hadn't existed, 
something we invented to oppress homosexuals, and that's nonsense.  
It is the building block.

<p>

MR. KOPPEL:  No, no, no.  What I am doing, Mr. Knight --
and forgive me; we should let our other guests have a chance to
get in here, too -- but what I am saying is that marriage -- you
refer to marriage as though it was some unchanging institution
that has not in any manner been modified over the years, and clearly,
it has.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it has not been modified to the extent
that the homosexuals are asking, which is to eliminate an entire
gender from it.  It's the bringing together of the two sexes.
Once you don't do that, you leave an entire gender out, that
makes it something else entirely.  It's not the same psychological
dynamics, emotional dynamics.  Homosexuals do not do what mom
and dad do in the bedroom.  They don't provide children the role
models that mom and dad do.  It's an entirely different animal
and doesn't deserve the same benefits that society gives marriages.

<p>

[Segment from Oprah, January 26, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: -- and that is why kids ought to be in marriages, not in 
gay households.  They need mothers and fathers.  Okay?

<p>

I want to ask the viewers.  I want to ask the viewers, do they really 
think their mom could be replaced by two gay men; or their dad, their
father, by two women?  Sexuality is not a small thing.  Boys need
fathers.  Girls do, too, so they understand men.

<p>

GUEST: People need loving parents.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Love is great, okay?  Love is great, but sexuality is 
important.  There are two different, complementary
sexes.  You guys are pretending people are interchangeable and
there's no difference.

<p>

GUEST: There's no pretending anywhere.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  There are a lot of people who are screwed up with
their gender identity because they didn't bond with their fathers
or their mothers.

<p>

GUEST: The question here is we're talking about
protecting children.  Lesbian and gay families do exist, and the
question is, are we going to protect the children here?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, we should.

<p>

GUEST: Are we going to entitle the children to child support?

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  I will tell you this.  May I just
interrupt this?  I've done this show before.  I've been down this
road, and years ago we did this show and I was so moved by the
children.  If you ask the children, the children will tell you
they want to be in a family where people love them, whether they
are two men, two women, a woman and a man.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

If you ask the children, that's what the children will tell you. 
The children just want people -- want to be loved and nurtured and
guided.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Okay, if a child told you, &quot;I'd rather
have three or four parents than two,&quot; would you say, &quot;Oh,
that's okay.  The kid wants it, so it must be right&quot;?  Who
do we decide?  Aren't we adults?  Come on, parents know better
than children know what they need.

<p>

GUEST: Listen. Look at society --

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  I'm just saying, ask the children.  Ask the
children, if they have a choice between being in a home with a
man and a woman who did not care for them or a man and woman who
had all these problems, divorce and fighting, arguing, abuse and
all that --

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  You can't compare a worst-case scenario
with something that's totally different.  You could say, well,
is a kid better off in a burning house or over here in a safe
gay household?  I mean, you could invent thousands of scenarios
like that.  Let's not be absurd.  There's a mountain of evidence.

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  Robert, I wasn't trying to be absurd, you know.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, I'm sorry.  That's how it came across to me.
There are mountains of evidence that show that kids do best in
mom-and-dad families.  You can't deny it.

<p>

<P>
<I><p>20 March, 2006.</I>
<p>

My cryptagent made the discovery.  It sure looked like a break-in:  the wreckage of 512bit crypto code, address shreds from bolted folders, a corrupted cache. I sure hope the CC boys found what they were looking for.
<P>
How did it happen that the Government now routinely reads what we write and say in the ether?  That sure wasn't the intention, back when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed.  The idea then was that very restricted language would be inserted that would protect our children.  I even remember the scene at a certain Wednesday meeting:  The "Family" alliance was making a big stink about "smut on the internet," and when we barely whispered, "censorship," they got even angrier.<I>  "See this language," they </i>and their conference committee champions said,<i> "this does nothing to inhibit free speech.  We're just taking the Pacifica definition of obscenity that everyone agrees with.  And look!  We even put in a paragraph that tells the FCC it has no power to enforce any of this!"</i>
<P>
How could you argue with that, especially when that particular staffer's hands were shaking with righteousness?  We all had similar run-ins.  We didn't want to alienate our friends on the side of the angels, so we let it pass.
<P>
We forgot the great truth about government in the last century:  legislation to do good for all ends up as government's authority to control us.  The Income Tax, Prohibition, the Draft, Citizens with Disabilities, the Clean Air Act, the Tobacco Control Act of '02;  all were designed to help people, boost the general welfare, promote civic virtue.  
<P>
But they were designed to achieve all these good things by fiat from above.  Today, so many of us think these laws pure tyranny, but the laws themselves did not enslave us.  We need to look elsewhere for that, to the ethos of rule.
<P>
The late-lamented twentieth century saw the maturation and old age of an industrial world.  It was a world of pyramids run from the top down, where those who made it to the top were called "the best and the brightest."  Law and Ivy credentials gave them the authority to call themselves<i> managers </i> (the equestrian rank of those days).  But they were not content to use this authority merely to rule.  They wanted to<i> help</I> people;  and they knew,
<i>O best and brightest,</I> that they had the smarts and the heart to do it.
<P>
They were<i> Progressives.</I>  The whole of the last century was informed by the urgent need for smart people to uplift everyone else.  And only they knew how.  And only they could do it.
<P>
This ethos of rule naturally inclined toward laws that would let the best and brightest do their good work right away.  But to do this, progressives needed not just authority;  they needed control.  Their reasoning:  <i>People will never do right on their own:  just look at the chaos and abuse of an open system.  People have to be told what to do.  The more they do what we say, the better things will be.</I>       
<P>
No, this was not Stalin's kind of control.  Not exactly.
<P>
Even now it is hard for us to believe that people who called themselves <i>Liberal and Progressive </I>for so long longed only to bring us a kinder and gentler Gulag.  But look at what they have done:
<P>
It's true, the language in the Telecom Act of '96 was careful.  FCC enforcement of the censorship provision <i>(what else can I call it!)</I> was forbidden.  The problem was, it was there in the first place.  We failed because we were worrying about the wrong problem.
<P>
We worried about "porn on the internet;"  or we were vulnerable, in some celestial way, to entreaties for the welfare of our children.  So we let a bill pass that gave progressive government still more authority over our lives.  The "Family" alliance was thinking,<i> Save our Children!,</I> but someone else was thinking,<i> I can do the protecting!</I>    
<P>
We then gave the Fed the implicit charge to go out and protect us some more.  Not the FCC.  Oh no.  The law said they could not enforce.  But there were scads of Federal agencies aching to enforce.  And enforce they did.  If the FCC was barred from enforcement, it was not denied the right of assistance.  And assist they did.
<P>
And those NSA geeks (don't tell me it was just CC boys) busting into my cache?  I knew it would happen eventually.  My encryption engine exceeded the Federal legal rating … and it was in use.  Like the old radar detectors, we all have them;  they're only illegal if you use them.  And since they're too hard to crack in volume, we get by.  We need 512 bits, for plain old privacy.
<P>
So that was how the Telecom language intended to protect us become our scourge:  All porn has to be encrypted, but encryption that works is illegal to use!  Since the porn guys have been giving away 512b engines and keys for free, the Feds say this means most kids can get it<i> (if you ignore the '000s of parental control products!). </I> So our Protectors have their probable cause <i>and</I> their slogan:<i>  For the children!</I>
<P>
I just hope it took them a nice long time to break in.  I left them a nice <i>.gif </I>of Manet's <i>Olympia.</I>  Good thing I've got the latest 1024b kernel on my hand-held.  At least they haven't started search and seizure
<P>
Yet.

<h3>THE MYTHS AND REALITIES OF TRADE PROTECTIONISM</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<P>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1077<br>
April 8, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This year's presidential campaign has raised once again the issue of free trade versus protectionism, with protectionists arguing that reducing foreign imports protects American jobs and benefits the overall U.S. economy. What are the facts?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence that protectionism produces economic benefits that outweigh its costs, but there is plenty of evidence that it does more harm than good. There is near unanimity among economists, for example, that free and unrestricted trade benefits economies while protectionism hurts them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America has a long history of advocating free trade, and, despite the claims of many, has been a free trade country throughout most of its history. When America has strayed from the path of free trade, the result has been economic hardship. Yet America today is on the brink of reviving protectionist policies that have failed in the past. The consequences would be all too predictable: lower living standards for all Americans, higher levels of unemployment, more business bankruptcies, and lingering economic decay.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The policies advanced by opponents of free trade ultimately are based on a number of myths: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #1: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. Today manufacturing measured as a percentage of the U.S. economy is about the same today as it was in 1967.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #2: High manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the cost to the overall economy. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. The cost of saving jobs from foreign competition is higher consumer prices, which harm the economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #3: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. </b>

<b>THE MYTHS OF TRADE PROTECTIONISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The protectionist approach to settling trade disputes with Japan, China, and other countries rests on a number of myths about free trade and trade deficits. These myths are the intellectual foundation of protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #1</b>: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. Opponents of free trade argue that cheaper labor in foreign countries forces American companies to move their operations overseas. They contend that in the long run, America is being de-industrialized. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. First of all, labor is not the only factor in producing manufactured goods. Other factors such as capital, natural resources, and infrastructure also must be considered. If labor was the only or even the most important factor, all the world's manufacturers would be located in such low-wage countries as Haiti, Somalia, and the Dominican Republic. Manufacturers avoid these poor countries because of the many problems that add to the cost of doing business there. For example, port facilities or roads may be inadequate or non-existent, driving up the costs of transporting goods to market; there may be no telephone or fax service; and local and federal taxes may be so high that they cancel out any savings from cheap labor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>America's Manufacturing Might.</b> Even more important, America is not de-industrializing. Manufacturing as a percentage of the U.S. economy is essentially the same today -- about 21 percent of GDP -- as it was in 1967.<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, employment in manufacturing has remained relatively stable over the last three decades. The number of Americans working in manufacturing jobs today (about 10.5 million) is about the same as in the early 1960s.<sup>2</sup>  Thus, even though these jobs represent a smaller percentage of the growing U.S. population, these Americans now are building computers and advanced medical devices instead of working in assembly lines sewing clothes or soldering circuit boards. If it is true that manufacturing is about the same percent of the U.S. economy as it was nearly 30 years ago, and that there are fewer workers as a percentage of the total U.S. population performing those tasks, then it is also true that the American worker is becoming more productive. This is a sign of strength, not weakness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #2</b>: High manufacturing wages must be protected regardless of the cost to the overall economy. Protectionists believe that American manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the costs to the rest of the country. They also argue that foreign competition causes Americans to lose their jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. The cost of saving jobs from foreign competition is higher consumer prices, which harm the economy. For example, when trade quotas were imposed on imported cars in the early 1980s, prices for domestic and imported cars rose by $2,000.<sup>3</sup>  While these quotas may have preserved some auto workers' jobs, they also passed the cost on to the American consumer. Instead of being able to use this money to send their children to college, pay their mortgages, or put food on the table, American consumers are forced to subsidize the jobs of other Americans who cannot compete internationally. In short, protectionism takes money from the many to support the high wages or jobs of the few.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, trying to save a few jobs through protectionism may cause a net loss of many more jobs. When the U.S. imposed import quotas on the auto industry in the 1980s, the price of a new U.S. automobile increased by an average of 41 percent from 1981 to 1984. This was nearly twice the average rate of increase for all consumer prices during that time. While the auto industry can claim that these price hikes saved up to 22,000 jobs, they also prevented many consumers from buying new cars.<sup>4</sup>  In fact, U.S. consumers bought around 1 million fewer U.S. cars after the U.S. imposed import quotas,<sup>5</sup> and the drop in sales forced the auto industry to lay off 50,000 workers in the late 1980s.<sup>6</sup>  Thus, even though 22,000 jobs apparently were saved, the layoffs caused by the price increase actually produced a net loss of 30,000 jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is more, the price increases cost the American consumers $17 billion in higher auto prices. To save just one of those 22,000 auto jobs, American consumers had to pay $772,727. It would have been cheaper if the American taxpayer, through the U.S. government, could have given these auto workers a one-time check for $500,000 and then laid them off. Either way, whether by imposing tariffs or by paying laid-off workers directly, the U.S. government would be subsidizing relatively few workers at great expense to Americans generally.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, the number of retail jobs destroyed by years of import restrictions on textile and apparel products is far greater than the number of jobs created or saved in the textile manufacturing industry. Americans pay 58 percent higher prices for textile and apparel products because of U.S. trade restrictions. This amounts to $11 billion to $15 billion a year.<sup>7</sup>  Thus, while protectionism saved 22,390 U.S. textile and apparel jobs in the 1980s, it cost the U.S. consumer $550,916 per job saved. However, once job losses in other industries, like the retail sector, are added to the equation, the cost of each job saved increases to well over $4 million.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It should be up to individual Americans, not government, to determine how much they pay for consumer goods. It is unfair to ask a school teacher making $26,000 a year to pay $2,000 more for a car to subsidize an auto worker who makes $50,000 a year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #3</b>: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. Advocates of protectionism argue that the United States is losing its technological edge to countries like Japan, mainly as a result of the U.S. dedication to free trade. These advocates argue that foreign competition has forced many U.S. high-tech firms into bankruptcy or out of the business of producing certain goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. America today is the most technologically advanced country in the world, a leader in the production of such high-tech products as advanced audio and video equipment, air conditioners, building and construction hardware, computers and computer software, environmental technology equipment, medical equipment and chemicals, navigational and surveying equipment, and telecommunications equipment. Moreover, American firms are recapturing the lead in many technological fields in which they had fallen behind during the 1980s. 
<p>
Two examples:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Example 1: Semiconductors.</b> Semiconductors are electrical components used to conduct electricity. They are used not only in the most basic of electrical products, such as toasters, but in the most advanced devices, such as supercomputers or orbital satellites. All electrical products incorporate some type of semiconductor, so this industry obviously is vital to the economic well-being of any country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, America is the world's largest manufacturer and seller of semiconductors. Many argue that an aggressive U.S. protectionist policy has raised the industry to its present status. In fact, however, it was U.S. private-sector joint ventures and sound business decisions by the U.S. semiconductor industry that resulted in this current prosperity. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the 1980s, Japan had become America's biggest rival in semiconductors. Japanese firms began to invest aggressively in computer memory chips, trying to beat out the remaining U.S. producers in this area. Sensing an impending downturn in demand, many U.S. firms abandoned production of these relatively low-tech items in favor of more profitable higher-tech products. One such product was the microprocessor. While the downturn in demand for memory chips did occur in the mid-1980s, and the Japanese endured major losses, American semiconductor manufacturers profited because they focused on producing microprocessors, not memory chips.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, after U.S. industry had walked away from the memory chip, sales in Japan dropped. The U.S. responded to this problem in 1986 by seeking a U.S.-Japan agreement that would force the Japanese to buy more semiconductors from the United States. But this agreement had little, if any impact on increased U.S. semiconductor sales in Japan. What did increase American semiconductor sales in Japan was a series of private-sector U.S. joint ventures with Japanese companies. These ventures gave U.S. companies access to crucial Japanese manufacturing techniques and distribution channels, in addition to shared research and development costs. In 1990, there was just a handful of U.S./Japan semiconductor partnerships; by 1994, there where over four dozen. It was these partnerships that enabled American companies to sell more semiconductors in Japan.<sup>10</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Example 2: Steel.</b> In the 1970s and 1980s, America's steel industry was unable to compete with cheaper, foreign made steel. Many steel workers were laid off, some permanently. Today, the U.S. steel industry is stronger, with growing sales and more profitability. Many advocates of protectionism argue that U.S. steel was saved by trade restrictions. In fact, however, protectionism in steel harmed the U.S. economy while failing to help the U.S. steel industry. What did help the U.S. steel industry?  Joint ventures with foreign firms and massive foreign investment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To help the U.S. steel industry cope with shrinking competitiveness in the 1970s, the Nixon Administration imposed relief from imports for a period of three years, during which the industry was supposed to modernize. In 1971, these import restraints were extended for another three years. From 1974 until 1993, the U.S. steel industry was under some kind of government protection. Wages rose from $9.90 per hour in 1970 to $17.46 per hour in 1980, an increase more than 60 percent higher than wage increases in the rest of the U.S. manufacturing sector.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The combination of higher steel wages and 20 years of protectionism cost more jobs among users of steel than were saved in the steel industry.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, Americans paid some $5 billion a year in higher prices. Thus, while protection may have saved jobs in the steel industry, it destroyed jobs in other industries that use steel to manufacture their products. For example, from 1969 to 1980, U.S. manufacturers using U.S.-made steel paid 20 to 25 percent more for their steel than was paid by their foreign competitors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Still, the U.S. steel industry did manage to make a tremendous comeback.<sup>12</sup>  The industry once again is making profits and, after years of modernization, is prepared to compete with foreign steel producers. The reason: Japanese foreign investment poured into the U.S. in the 1980s and gave U.S. steel companies the money they needed to build new plants and adopt more advanced manufacturing techniques. Moreover, private sector joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese steel companies taught U.S. firms how to manufacture steel more efficiently.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #4</b>: Trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial. This is the core idea behind protectionism and managed trade. Advocates of this view argue that trade deficits harm the economy, destroy jobs, and reflect weakness in the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than of weakness. The U.S. trade deficit means that Americans hold more goods than their foreign trading partners, while foreigners hold more U.S. dollars. As the richest country in the world, America consumes goods and services from both U.S. and foreign companies. The influx of foreign goods and services in return for dollars adds to America's wealth. It does not detract from it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans receive imported goods and services that increase their standard of living. Moreover, the dollars sent abroad for the purchase of goods and services typically cannot be spent within those countries. While dollars are traded between countries in financial markets, they are used mainly by foreign consumers to buy American goods and services. Thus, nations use surplus dollars to buy American goods and services, invest in American firms, or purchase U.S. Treasury bonds. These investments create jobs and wealth for Americans, while the purchase of Treasury bonds frees U.S. domestic capital for savings, investment, and purchases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the example of someone who goes to the supermarket and buys $150 worth of groceries. The protectionist believes the proprietor has a trade "surplus" of $150, and the customer has a "deficit" of $150. But this is not the case. The grocer ends up with $150 in currency, while the customer has $150 worth of groceries. It is a mutually beneficial transaction. No one would expect the grocer to buy an equal amount of goods from the customer in order to have an equal balance sheet in exchanged goods. Nor should one expect countries to have an even balance sheet in international trade. The trade deficit represents nothing more than a surplus of foreign goods and services which Americans now own. The value of these goods and services is as much a part of the national wealth as is the possession of U.S. dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another misunderstanding involves the calculation of the trade deficit. At least one-third to one-half of the U.S. trade deficit figure counts U.S. imports from American overseas subsidiaries as part of the deficit. For example, when Ford Mexico sends a motor from its plant to the Ford assembly plant in Detroit, it is counted as an import. However, if Ford then sells an American-made car with a Mexican-made motor in the U.S., there is no corresponding export. Thus, a "deficit" supposedly is created. But why should a car sold in the U.S., even though it has a Mexican-made engine, be calculated as part of the trade deficit?  Most of the money made from this sale stays in the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Trade deficits are not harmful to the economy. If they were, America would not be the economic powerhouse it is today. The U.S. has run a trade deficit for most of its history. For the first hundred years, these deficits were fairly large; nevertheless, throughout this period, growth rates were higher than they are today. Trade deficits did not destroy the economy then. Nor will they destroy it in the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #5</b>: Trade deficits cost jobs. Protectionists claim that trade deficits are a major cause of unemployment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. History shows that, on average, unemployment drops as trade deficits rise. For example, while the trade deficit leaped in 1983-1984 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted, from 9.6 percent in 1983 to 5.5 percent in 1988. When the trade deficit began to shrink from 1989 to 1991, on the other hand, unemployment rose from 5.3 percent to 6.7 percent, and when it began to rise again from 1992 to 1994, unemployment fell from 7.4 percent to 6.1 percent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Looking further back in history confirms that trade deficits do not cause a loss of jobs. Every year the trade deficit increased since 1962, unemployment decreased. Likewise, every year the trade deficit decreased since 1962, unemployment increased shortly thereafter.<sup>13</sup>  Despite the trade deficit, the economy was growing and jobs were being created.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why, then, are some major corporations laying off large numbers of workers?  The answer has nothing to do with trade deficits and everything to do with America's own economic ills. The U.S. economy today suffers from a host of government policies and regulations that are strangling corporate America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faced with a proliferation of environmental regulations, financial reporting requirements, and worker safety laws, American companies are finding it more and more expensive and difficult to comply with government directives. While many regulations may have laudable goals, their implementation is causing severe hardship for America's corporations. This, combined with added costs, causes far more job losses than trade deficits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #6</b>: Prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies. U.S. policymakers often use the managed trade policies of Japan as an example of how a country can eliminate trade deficits, increase living standards, and achieve greater economic stability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. A closer look reveals that Japan's managed trade policies have had mixed results. The real purchasing power of Japanese consumers is at least 20 percent less than that of the American consumer. For example, using purchasing power parity, which takes into account differences in currency values, local prices, availability of goods and services, and inflation, America has a per capita income of $25,860. Japan, however, has a per capita income of only $21,350.<sup>14</sup>  This means that the Japanese have a lower standard of living than Americans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan's lower standard of living can be attributed partly to a highly regulated economy that drives up the cost of living. For example, policies that restrict such imports as agricultural products, beef, and other food items force the average Japanese to spend about 25 percent of his disposable income on food, compared to less than 12 percent for Americans. Spending more on food means less money for housing and other needs. The result: a lower standard of living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Managed trade is not responsible for Japan's prosperity. In fact, Japan's prosperity exists in spite of Japan's managed trade and industrial policies. In the end, the freer trade and market economic policies of the U.S. have produced a higher standard of living in America than in Japan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #7</b>: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits competition from foreign imports and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. Advocates of managed trade argue that closed overseas markets are the chief reason for America's trade deficit, causing enormous economic hardships that result in bankruptcies and lost jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. This scare tactic is employed by U.S. companies to frighten policymakers into taking up their cause in Washington. And what is their cause?  To limit import competition and force foreign countries to purchase a set amount of U.S. goods and services. These companies argue that they are hurt by closed markets overseas. As a result, they want Congress and the Administration to punish American consumers by forcing them to pay higher prices for imported products like automobiles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But if American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter?  The U.S. exported over $783 billion in goods and services in the first 11 months of 1995.<sup>15</sup>  By contrast, Germany exported only $414 billion and Japan only $397 billion in all of 1994.<sup>16</sup>  Clearly, most U.S. exporters experience little if any difficulty finding overseas markets for their goods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the U.S. auto industry. Is it on the verge of bankruptcy today?  It is not. It racked up $14 billion in profits last year. The main reason for Detroit's resurgence was not government coddling. Rather, it is because manufacturers are building better automobiles. This is the result of competition from Europe and Japan. Today, American cars are better built, have fewer flaws, and are bigger sellers than many of their Japanese and European counterparts. For all this, the Big Three auto makers have the free market to thank, not the meddling hand of the federal government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #8</b>: Because the U.S. is unable to sell some goods and services in countries like Japan, these countries must have closed markets. Many protectionists argue that the U.S. has an open market while countries like Japan restrict American imports. Thus, they blame Japan for its trade surplus with the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Japan is no more protectionist than the United States. This is the conclusion of The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><i>Index of Economic Freedom</i></a>, which measures the relative level of economic freedom in over 100 countries. The study concludes that, from a global perspective, Japan and the U.S. have relatively equal levels of protectionism.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The trade deficit with Japan is not nearly as bad as protectionists argue. For example, the commonly reported trade deficit figures measure only merchandise trade. While these figures represent the bulk of the trade between the U.S. and Japan, they also ignore the tremendous trade surplus the U.S. has in consulting, telecommunications, computers, and other services. Thus, the deficit is usually smaller than commonly reported. Moreover, much of the trade deficit with Japan comes from counting the products of Japan-based American companies exporting their goods back home. The profits from these sales go to the stockholders of American companies, not directly to the Japanese.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The truth is that Japan is America's largest overseas export market. Japan imported $69 billion in goods from America in 1995 -- that is more than the U.S. exported to Britain and Germany combined ($22 billion and $19 billion, respectively).<sup>18</sup>  Moreover, on a per capita basis, Japan buys more from the U.S. than America buys from Japan. For example, each Japanese citizen bought $444 worth of U.S. goods and services in 1994, while each American citizen purchased only $441 worth of Japanese goods and services.<sup>19</sup>  But because Japan's population is about 50 percent smaller than America's, a deficit exists. Americans purchase more Japanese goods overall because there are twice as many Americans as Japanese. Thus, a trade deficit exists for many reasons, not just because of -- or even primarily because of -- Japanese protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #9</b>: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy. Protectionists argue that trade surpluses are created intentionally by government policy. Thus, they reason, trade deficits must be dealt with in the same manner -- by government action through tariffs and other forms of protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Those who argue that trade surpluses and deficits are the result of government manipulation do not understand how a market economy works. They ignore, for example, that some countries with scarce natural resources are likely to run a trade surplus because they must import relatively inexpensive unfinished goods and export more expensive finished goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan is a case in point. It must import such raw materials as oil and lumber. These raw materials are used to manufacture more expensive finished products, some of which are exported. Throughout this process, the Japanese are adding value to the imported raw materials by making more expensive finished products for export. The result is a trade surplus. By contrast, the U.S. has abundant natural resources, which in many cases it exports. Thus, most of its imports are finished goods, which are more expensive and worth more than the raw materials that went into making them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #10</b>: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. Protectionists believe the best way to open foreign markets is to threaten trade retaliation. The weapons of choice: special tariffs, duties, and import quotas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. The U.S. has resorted to threats of trade retaliation to open foreign markets, but most of the time they have backfired. The principal U.S. law used to threaten trade retaliation is Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which grants the President the authority to impose punitive trade restrictions on imports. Of the nearly 80 Section 301 cases initiated by the U.S. since 1974, only about 15 were successful. Yet even in these cases, American consumers were saddled with billions of dollars in higher prices caused by higher tariffs and special duties. In the end, all Americans were the losers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #11</b>: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. Advocates of trade protectionism argue that the U.S. should pull out of these and related institutions and agreements because they all infringe on American sovereignty and represent a move toward world government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. A world government would indeed be a grotesque and harmful development, but these agreements or organizations will not lead to such a result.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nothing in any of America's trade agreements, including the NAFTA, can force America to follow any law not previously passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by the President. All of these agreements contain language stating that no decisions made under them can supersede domestic U.S. law. How can a foreign organization like the WTO infringe on U.S. sovereignty if it lacks the power to supersede or overrule U.S. law? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Free trade is, in fact, the antithesis of world government. It depends on the free flow of ideas as well as goods and services. This promotion of freedom worldwide is inconsistent with the centralizing principle of world government.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The driving force behind the protectionist threat of trade sanctions against Japan, China, and other countries is a misguided belief that trade deficits are harmful to the economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Trade deficits are a sign of economic strength. They often represent a growing economy in which jobs and wealth are being created, not lost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another myth that inspires the protectionist is that trade deficits are mainly the result of closed markets overseas. This also is not true. There are many markets for U.S. goods and services overseas. In fact, the U.S. is the largest exporter in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Trade protectionists misunderstand America's position in the international economy. By failing to understand America's massive export strength, they fail to comprehend the implications of America's trade deficit. And they have mistaken the reasons why Japan and other countries have a trade surplus. As a result of these misjudgments, protectionists advocate a trade policy that could threaten the wealth and prosperity of all Americans. Their myths are not merely academic, but profoundly important in a practical sense. Getting the facts straight in this debate is vitally important to the future prosperity of the American people.

<title>Gary Bauer's April, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

April 15, 1996

<p><center>

<i>

&quot;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed;<br>
we are perplexed, but not in despair;<br>
Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.&quot;

<p>

-2 Corinthians 4: 8-9

</i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

I write to you this month on a subject that weighs heavily on
my heart.  That subject is the persecution of believers around
the world, including here in the United States.  As I've learned
more about the nature and extent of this persecution, it has become
increasingly clear to me that as Christians, we must do more for
our suffering brothers and sisters both here and abroad.  From
China to Saudi Arabia to Sudan, one's profession of faith in Jesus
Christ is becoming an ever more dangerous act in the eyes of the
state.  It is time for men and women of faith to speak up!

<p>

Michael Horowitz is one man who has courageously raised his voice
on this issue.  Mike and I go back many years, to the days when
we both served in the Reagan administration.  My primary responsibilities
were education and the family.  Mike's were economic and regulatory
matters in the Office of Management and Budget.  We worked together
on several issues, and I observed the character of this man up
close.  For that reason, it didn't surprise me at all last summer
when Mike Horowitz, who is Jewish, wrote a heart-rending article
on anti-Christian persecution for <I>The Wall Street Journal.</I>

<p>

Mike was appalled by the harassment, physical abuse and
even death being routinely inflicted on Christians overseas.
But he was even more appalled by the continued refusal of our
government to focus on and do anything about this persecution.
And I have been deeply disappointed by the timidity and silence
that unfortunately have reigned among so many Christians in America,
who, myself included, needed to hear the eloquence of Mike Horowitz
to be shaken with the conviction that we must act.

<p>

This past January, I attended a meeting of evangelical leaders
in Washington, DC that Mike cosponsored with Freedom House.  Freedom
House is a widely respected human rights organization, founded
at the outbreak of World War II.  The information they shared
regarding systematic persecution of Christians was overwhelming:

<p><ul>

<li>Incidents of intimidation, arrest, and torture are growing
under various regimes around the world.  The worst offenders are 
Islamic fundamentalist governments and communist regimes. Millions 
of Christians worldwide are routinely subjected to this persecution, 
most of which goes unreported in the United States.

<p>

<li>In Sudan, 1.5 million people have died as a result of the Islamic
north's <i>jihad</i>, or &quot;holy war,&quot; against the largely 
Christian south.[1] The war has displaced another 5 million. Children 
of Christian parents are being conscripted for service in the
Islamic government army.  One mother, of boys eight and nine,
was imprisoned and savagely beaten when she went to retrieve them 
from a <i>mujahadeen</i> training camp.[2] She was pregnant at the 
time. Thousands of children of Christian parents, as young as six, 
have been taken and sold as slaves in Sudan, Libya and elsewhere.[3]

<p>

<li>Three of the most prominent evangelical leaders in Iran were
abducted and murdered in 1994.  The law there effectively prohibits
Christians from attending any kind of religious service, and those 
who dare to evangelize have been arrested, brutally tortured, and 
forced to renounce their faith.[4]

<p>

<li>Christians who flee Iran through Turkey are forced by the American
Embassy there to undergo interviews by Turkish security police who are
sympathetic toward Iran's laws against &quot;blasphemy.&quot;  Many of 
these refugees fail these interviews and face forcible return to Iran. 
American Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) field offices 
commonly treat refugees the same way.[5] In other words, the only things 
we are &quot;exporting&quot; to Iran are Christians!

<p>

<li>The government of Egypt, which has received billions of dollars
in U.S. assistance (our tax money!), has attempted to appease 
domestic Islamic fundamentalists by imprisoning and torturing Christian 
converts and evangelists.

<p>

<li>In China, persecution of the country's estimated 30 million
Christians is a matter of official public policy.  Catholics in the 
People's Republic are permitted to join only the official state church, 
whose bishops are appointed by Beijing and not by the pope. If they 
refuse to &quot;register,&quot; they are routinely imprisoned and
tortured or, in the classic communist style, &quot;re-educated
through labor&quot; -- the official euphemism for doing hard time in 
the labor camps.

</ul><p>

Recently, FRC's chief of government relations, Marty Dannenfelser,
testified before a House International Relations subcommittee
on this plague of persecution.  He made it clear that our government
has not done enough to highlight and to halt these disgraceful
abuses.  We reject the idea that these problems will go away through
quiet diplomacy, or that abuses will only increase if our government
openly criticizes the perpetrators.  History shows that speaking
out is the only way to deter tyrants.

<p>

Our own government must cease its tolerance of the mistreatment
of religious minorities around the world.  Saudi Arabia is a prime
example.  Recently the Saudis pressured the United States about
&quot;objectionable&quot; activities by American nationals stationed
there.  One complaint involved the operation of a U.S.-sponsored
nightclub frequented by American servicemen.  Our government dug
in its heels and refused to bow to Saudi requests to close it.
At the same time, the Saudis demanded that we stop holding Sunday
worship services at our embassy in Riyadh -- that is, on U.S. soil!
To this, the Clinton Administration buckled under.

<p>

I mentioned at the beginning of this letter that the United States
is also troubled by anti-Christian persecution.  The major difference,
of course, is that the examples I am about to cite are not sponsored
or tolerated by our government.  Nevertheless, their impact on
the religious liberties we hold so dear can be just as devastating.
In the past few years, the United States has experienced a wave
of violent attacks on Christian churches.  According to an investigative
report compiled by <I>USA Today</I>, some 25 black churches, primarily
in the South, have been the targets of arson.  The pace of these
attacks is clearly accelerating.

<p>

The wave seems to have begun on April 4, 1993, the 25th anniversary
of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Twelve churches were burned last year, and so far this year at
least seven more have been torched.  In roughly two thirds of
these incidents, no arrests have been made.  This month, of course,
brings another anniversary of Dr. King's death, and many fear
that the attacks on churches will worsen.  Again, the only way
to prevent this tragedy from happening is for each of us to speak
out against these crimes and for the government to bring the 
perpetrators to justice.

<p>

In February, FRC joined with several evangelical, Jewish, Catholic
and civil rights groups in calling for congressional hearings
into these incidents.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has
also begun to investigate them, but the added visibility of Congressional
hearings can serve a number of useful purposes.  After our call
for hearings, the Congressional Family Caucus, whose roster includes
several dozen freshman members of Congress, also issued a plea
for hearings.  As I'm writing this, FRC has received assurances
from House Judiciary Committee staff that in-depth hearings will
occur later this spring.

<p>

FRC is also calling upon the Clinton administration to speak
out forcefully on these events.  Attorney General Janet Reno shoulders
a special responsibility to ensure that potential arsonists know
that the full weight of federal law enforcement will be brought
to bear to end these attacks.  We have publicly urged her to show
the same zeal in pursuing the perpetrators of these incidents
as she has shown in pursuing her theories of conspiracy among
peaceful protestors outside abortion clinics!

<p>

It's too early to know for certain, but these attacks on churches
are most likely motivated by both religious <b>and</b> racial
bigotry.  Anti-Christian bigotry is the American &quot;exception&quot; 
-- the only acceptable form of intolerance in modern America.  Just 
consider how muffled the response was to the invasion of St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York by members of the homosexual group Act-Up.
The Montrose Baptist Church, in suburban Washington, DC, has
also been the target of two suspicious fires in recent years.
It is probably no coincidence that the church was heavily involved
on the pro-life side of Maryland's recent abortion referendum.

<p>

Racial prejudice is obviously at work, too.  The damage it wreaks
on America's social fabric is astonishing.  It makes me wonder
if Americans will ever judge one another by the content of our
character, and not the color of our skin.  Can this hatred that
affronts the gospel of Christ continue to divide our house and
drag this nation down?  Our greatest hope is for spiritual revival
to again sweep our land and to bring about healing through reconciliation
within families and between races.  Then and only then will we
know our country is well on the road to recovery.

<p>

The seeds of ethnic hatred should find no fertile soil in this
land we love. That is why I included the following statement
in the Compact with Our Fellow Americans that appears in my new
book, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

In our work and community life, we promise to elevate a public
ethic of individual merit, regardless of ethnic or national origin, 
or political or religious belief. We will not tolerate the expression, 
public or private, of bigotry on any such basis.  We will judge 
all persons we meet by the content of their character, not the color 
of their skin.

</i>

</blockquote><p>

As this statement suggests, the task of combating religious and
racial hatred is not, first of all, the task of government.  It
is every citizen's task, a battle within the heart that, won there,
cannot be lost in the public square.

<p>

In closing, let me ask that you take up your pen right away and
urge your representatives in Congress to act decisively on these
twin issues.  With a united America behind them, they will be
empowered to act boldly.  In the meantime, let us heed the words
of the apostle Paul and cast off all distress and despair.  Where
we have Christ, we have hope.

<p>

We at FRC feel greatly blessed to be in the heart of our nation's
capital, with the daily chance to address our political leaders
on these vital concerns.  Your friendship and financial support
are part of that blessing, and you have my deepest thanks for
remembering us.  If your circumstances permit, your gift to us
this month will mean so much to our campaign on behalf of family,
faith, and freedom.  Your continued involvement and support are
essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. It's always difficult to end a letter like this with a
little house-keeping, but the enclosures this month require some
explanation.  As you know, FRC communicates with you on a regular
basis. You most likely receive both my monthly letter and <I>Washington
Watch,</I> and perhaps other mailings as well. Our goal
is to ensure that every item we send you is useful to your family.
At the same time, we are keenly aware of our responsibility to
exercise stewardship over the resources you entrust to us.  If
you are receiving any mail from FRC that is not meeting your needs,
this is your chance to let us know.  We look forward to continuing
to send you the timeliest pro-family reports available today.

<p>

Please return the enclosed card at your earliest opportunity and note, 
that while we do hope you will respond, <b>no financial gift is 
necessary</b>. Your reply will aid us in serving you -- and many more 
families besides -- to the best of our ability. God bless you.

<h3>THE CHALLENGE OF REVOLUTIONARY IRAN</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Committee Brief No. 24<br>
March 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent Middle Eastern travels of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan have sparked considerable controversy. Several Congressmen have called for a government investigation of the trip, including Representative Peter King, who gave a persuasive speech on this subject at The Heritage Foundation on March 6.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, I would like to focus on the foreign activities of Iran, which I believe poses the greatest threat to America and to American interests of all the countries that Minister Farrakhan visited. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. and Iran have clashed repeatedly over a wide variety of issues since Iran's 1979 revolution, which brought to power radical Islamic fundamentalists led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Bilateral tensions initially flared due to the November 4, 1979, seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants and the subsequent holding of American hostages for 444 days. Iran-U.S. tensions continue to simmer due to Iran's persistent efforts to export its revolution, Iranian support for international terrorism, Iran's ideological hostility to the U.S., and Iran's military buildup, which includes clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran today looms as the chief threat to American interests in the Middle East. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the military defeat and diplomatic isolation of Iraq, Iran's traditional archrival, has given Iran the opportunity to expand its influence. Although Tehran has toned down its revolutionary rhetoric since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, Iran remains a volatile revolutionary state. Tehran continues to denounce the U.S. as "the Global Arrogance," calls for the expulsion of American influence from the Middle East, seeks to discredit and overthrow moderate Arab governments friendly to the U.S., advocates the destruction of Israel, and adamantly opposes the U.S.-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran also has increased its financial, political, and military support for radical Islamic fundamentalist movements throughout the Middle East and Southwest Asia. It has developed close ties with Sudan, which it uses as a training ground for Islamic militants from throughout the region. In the short run, Iran poses more of an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat than a military threat to America and its Middle Eastern allies. In the long run, however, Iran's military buildup, particularly its development programs for nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weaponry, will pose an increasingly grave challenge to the security of American forces and U.S. allies in the region.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S HOSTILE FOREIGN POLICY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, Tehran has seen itself as the leader of the Muslim world. It has sought to export its revolutionary brand of Islam and to radicalize Muslims everywhere. The U.S., which Khomeini referred to as the "Great Satan," is hated for its support of the Iranian regime of Shah Reza Pahlavi; for its support of Israel, which Iranian radicals seek to destroy; and for its support of moderate Arab regimes such as those in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But regardless of its policies, the U.S. is hated for its values and the powerful influence of its culture, which Iranian revolutionaries believe seduces Muslims and undermines Islam. This ideological motivation explains why Iranian-supported terrorists in Lebanon in the 1980s attacked targets affiliated with the American University of Beirut and Christian churches, in addition to the U.S. Marines serving in the multinational peacekeeping force.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1979, Iran has been more of an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat to its neighbors than a military threat. Tehran has enjoyed only limited success in fomenting revolution, in part because Iran's Shiite brand of Islam is shared by only about 15 percent of all Muslims. The Sunni (orthodox) Muslims who make up more than 80 percent of the Islamic world tend to be more respectful of state authority and distrustful of Shiite radicals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's greatest success has come in war-torn Lebanon, where it helped to create, finance, arm, and train the radical Shiite Hezbollah (Party of God) movement. Several hundred Iranian Revolutionary Guards, the militant shock troops of the Iranian revolution, work closely in support of Hezbollah in Lebanon's Bekaa valley. Tehran also supports less powerful Shiite fundamentalist groups in Iraq, Bahrain, and Afghanistan. But Shiite revolutionaries have seized power nowhere outside Iran. In fact, Shiite rebellions have been crushed in Iraq (1991) and Saudi Arabia (1979), and an Iranian-backed coup attempt was quashed in Bahrain in 1981.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iranian-supported Islamic revolutions, however, now have better prospects for success. The dissolution of the Soviet Union not only has opened up Central Asia to Iranian influence, but also has deprived secular Arab nationalist regimes in Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Syria of a source of political, military, and economic support. The failure of Arab socialism in such countries as Algeria and Egypt has left them with feeble economies unable to absorb the huge number of youths who are entering the labor market. Faced with a bleak economic future, young Arabs are turning to radical fundamentalist movements to find hope and meaning in their lives. Some Arab fundamentalists, radicalized by the Islamic holy war (jihad) against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, have returned home to spearhead anti-government violence in their own countries. Iranian-supported Muslim fundamentalists are well-positioned to exploit the collapse of Soviet communism and Arab socialism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran has established good working relations with several Sunni fundamentalist groups since 1990, including Hamas (the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement); Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine; the Islamic Group of Egypt; and similar groups in Algeria, Jordan, and Tunisia. The opening of Arab-Israeli peace talks at the Madrid Conference in October 1991 gave Iran and Palestinian fundamentalists a common interest in disrupting the U.S.-sponsored negotiations by escalating terrorist attacks against Israel. Iran invited a Hamas delegation to attend an October 1992 international conference held in Tehran to coordinate opposition to the peace process. Tehran subsequently agreed to help train Hamas terrorists, give Hamas $30 million over two years, and permit Hamas to open an "embassy" in Tehran. Israeli intelligence officials estimate that Iran now provides 10 to 20 percent of the roughly $70 million in donations that Hamas receives annually from its supporters around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Tehran has welcomed the terrorist offensive which Hamas launched against Israel in the last month, killing 62 people in four suicide bombings. The state-run Iranian news service called the bombings "God's retribution."  Despite the worldwide revulsion triggered by the bombings, Iran remains one of Hamas' foremost foreign backers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's efforts to reach out to Sunni fundamentalists have been facilitated by Iran's closest ally, Sudan, which is ruled by the only radical fundamentalist regime in the Arab world. Arab officials maintain that Sudan has helped Iran establish ties with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Jordan, the Renaissance fundamentalist movement in Tunisia, and the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S LINKS TO SUDAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran has become the chief supporter and ally of Sudan's National Islamic Front, a Sunni fundamentalist movement that came to power following Lt. General Omar Hassan Bashir's 1989 coup. Sudan, Africa's largest state, offers Iran a strategic foothold to outflank Saudi Arabia and extend its revolutionary influence throughout North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Iranian-Sudanese cooperation escalated following President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's December 1991 visit to Sudan. Hundreds of Iranian military advisers and Revolutionary Guards were dispatched to Sudan to help train the Sudanese Army and internal security forces. Iranians also are believed to be assisting Sudan's radical regime in its long-running war against Christian and animist rebels in southern Sudan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although Iran claims that most of these personnel in Sudan are engaged in construction projects, persistent reports indicate that the Revolutionary Guards are training Islamic fundamentalist revolutionaries and terrorists, primarily from Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia. U.S. officials maintain that Iranians train terrorists in five camps around Khartoum that are equipped and financed by Iran. The Egyptian government contends that several thousand Egyptian fundamentalists have received training from Iranians in Sudanese camps. Egyptian intelligence officials claim to have evidence that Iran was responsible for training and organizing terrorists who have attacked foreign tourists in Egypt. Algeria expelled Iranian diplomats in November 1992 and broke diplomatic relations with Iran in March 1993 after accusing Tehran of supporting Islamic radicals who have waged a bloody guerrilla war against Algeria's military regime that has resulted in the deaths of over 30,000 Algerians since 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sudan has become in effect a "new Lebanon" where Iranian revolutionaries arm, train, and equip Arab fundamentalists for political violence while denying responsibility for their actions. Significantly, Iran's former ambassador to Sudan, Majid Kamal, helped create Hezbollah when he was the Iranian charg‚ d'affaires in Beirut in the early 1980s. But unlike Lebanon, where Iran's freedom of action is constrained by Syria's military domination, the fundamentalist Sudanese government fully shares Iran's revolutionary goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sudan also is a valuable ally for Iran because of its key role in helping Iran to expand its contacts with Sunni fundamentalists, especially Egyptian and Palestinian groups opposed to peace negotiations with Israel. Iranian-supported Egyptian fundamentalists easily can infiltrate the porous Sudanese-Egyptian border, seeking to overthrow the Egyptian government. The Islamic Group, which considers Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman to be its spiritual leader, has launched terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of Egyptians since early 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Egypt is one of Iran's most important targets for subversion because of its historic role as the preeminent Arab power. An Islamic revolution in Egypt would send shock waves throughout the Arab world and incite Islamic revolution elsewhere. Moreover, a radical fundamentalist Egypt would break its peace treaty with Israel and render moot the U.S.-backed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which Iran has denounced as "treason."  As the leading Muslim power unequivocally opposed to Israel's existence, Iran stands to gain much from prolonging the Arab-Israeli conflict.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S SUPPORT OF TERRORISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran is the world's "most active state sponsor of international terrorism and continues to be directly involved in planning and executing terrorist acts," according to the State Department's most recent report on terrorism, <I>Patterns of Global Terrorism, 1994</i>, which was published in April 1995. Iranian intelligence agencies support terrorism, either directly or through extremist groups, primarily aimed against Iranian opposition movements, Israel, or moderate Arab regimes. Tehran has established over 20 ideological and military training camps in Iran, Lebanon, and Sudan staffed by Arabic-speaking Revolutionary Guards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hezbollah, Iran's most important surrogate, has become the "world's principal international terrorist organization," according to former CIA Director James Woolsey, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 28, 1993. The Lebanon-based organization has established groups of supporters as far away as Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, and South America. Hezbollah's long list of terrorist atrocities includes the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks at Beirut Airport, and the kidnapping of most of the 15 American hostages held in Lebanon between 1984 and 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The last American hostages held in Lebanon were released by Hezbollah at Iran's direction in late 1991 after Tehran concluded that it could gain nothing from holding the hostages any longer. Iran's use of terrorism as an instrument of policy remains undiminished, however. In recent years, Tehran has stepped up its terrorist attacks against Iranian exile leaders and Israel. More than a dozen Iranian dissidents have been assassinated in European cities since 1987, including the August 1991 murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in Paris and the September 1992 murders of four Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Iran's terrorist campaign against exiled opposition activists appears to be growing in intensity in recent months. On February 20, 1996, two Iranian exiles were assassinated in Turkey. On March 2, two Sunni Iranian clerics were assassinated in Pakistan. And on March 7, another Iranian opposition activist was assassinated in Baghdad, the sixth killed inside Iraq since May 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Iran's assassins also have struck inside the United States. Iranian political activist Ali A. Tabatabai, the founder of the Iran Freedom Foundation, was murdered at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, on July 22, 1980.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Although Iranians recently have not been caught launching terrorist attacks on American targets, Iran furnishes substantial financial, logistical, and training support to terrorist groups that continue to target Americans. Tehran provided financial support, at a minimum, for some of the Islamic militants arrested for the February 1993 bombing that killed six people at the World Trade Center in New York. Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, the radical Egyptian cleric who inspired and guided the bombers, long has been funded by Iran's intelligence service, according to Vincent Cannistraro, former head of CIA counterterrorism operations. Sheik Omar reportedly was regularly given large sums of money by Iran's delegation to the United Nations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although no direct Iranian participation has been established in the World Trade Center bombing, senior U.S. officials warned in March 1993 that Iranian-backed terrorist groups appeared to be becoming more aggressive. Iran also reportedly has begun cooperating with non-fundamentalist terrorist groups such as the Abu Nidal Organization, a renegade Palestinian terrorist group that has launched some of the bloodiest and most indiscriminate terrorist attacks, such as the December 1985 massacres at the Rome and Vienna airports. Iran also financially supports the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), a pro-Syrian group which it reportedly asked in 1988 to bomb a U.S. airliner in retaliation for the July 1988 accidental downing of an Iranian airliner by the <I>U.S.S. Vincennes</I>. The plot was disrupted by the arrest of a terrorist cell in Germany in October 1988. Libyan agents reportedly then bombed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iranian-supported terrorists have been particularly active against targets in Turkey. The Turkish Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility in 1992 for the murder of an Israeli diplomat and the bombing of an Istanbul synagogue. It also is believed to be responsible for a series of murders of Turkish journalists. Iran also supports the Marxist Kurdish Workers' Party, which has waged a long-running terrorist war against the government in eastern Turkey. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But in recent years it has been Israel that has been the prime foreign target of Iran's terror campaign. Iran was involved in the March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, which killed 29 people. In March 1994, three Iranian agents were arrested in Thailand after an abortive attempt to detonate a truck bomb at the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok. Iranian involvement is also suspected in the July 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 96 people. Iran continues to support Hezbollah's terrorist offensive against Israeli forces along the Lebanese-Israeli border, as well as the terrorist operations of Hamas inside Israel. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Under Iranian tutelage, Sudan has emerged as a leading sponsor of international terrorism. Sudan has given sanctuary to a wide spectrum of terrorist groups, including many Arab militants who participated in the fundamentalist jihad in Afghanistan. Sudan gave Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman sanctuary before he moved to New York. Two Sudanese diplomats were implicated in the aborted plot by eight of the Sheik's followers to bomb the United Nations headquarters in New York. Moreover, five of the eight suspected terrorists arrested for the plot in June 1993 were Sudanese. Sudan's escalating involvement in international terrorism led Washington in August 1993 to add Sudan to the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism, which also has included Iran since 1984. This prohibits the transfer of U.S. military equipment, militarily useful civilian technology, and foreign aid to the terrorist state, strips it of favorable trade privileges, and requires the U.S. to block loans by international financial institutions.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S MILITARY BUILDUP</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran currently poses only a limited conventional military threat to its neighbors. Since the 1979 revolution, its armed forces have been weakened by political purges, huge losses of up to 60 percent of their major weapons systems in the eight-year war with Iraq, and shortages of spare parts for U.S. and Western arms supplied before 1979. But President Rafsanjani has accorded a high priority to building Iran's military strength. Shortly after coming to power in July 1989, Rafsanjani traveled to Moscow to sign a $1.9 billion arms deal that included 48 modern MiG-29 <I>Fulcrum</I> fighters and 100 T-72 tanks. His government, in January 1990, allocated $2 billion per year for five years to buy advanced arms. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's ambitious military plans have sparked considerable concern that Tehran seeks to establish regional hegemony by building its military capabilities far beyond its legitimate defense needs. Iran's long-term objective reportedly is to acquire a modern air force of roughly 300 advanced combat aircraft; a modern army with 5,000 to 6,000 tanks, 2,000 self-propelled artillery pieces, and thousands of armored personnel carriers; and a navy upgraded with three advanced Russian <I>Kilo</I>-class submarines and scores of fast patrol boats armed with missiles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran also has purchased hundreds of ballistic missiles and the technology to produce them from North Korea and China. Tehran has acquired at least 300 SCUD-B surface-to-surface missiles with a range of approximately 185 miles, and an unknown number of improved SCUD-Cs, which have a range of approximately 370 miles. These missiles enable Iran to attack states across the Persian Gulf. Iran also reportedly has agreed to buy 150 North Korean Nodong 1 missiles with an estimated range of over 600 miles. These surface-to-surface missiles are capable of delivering conventional, chemical, or nuclear warheads on targets as far away as Israel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's missile buildup is especially worrisome given Tehran's determined efforts to build weapons of mass destruction. Iran has "the most active chemical warfare program" in the Third World, according to an anonymous U.S. government official quoted in the <I>Washington Post</I> on March 8, 1996. The CIA estimates that Iran has produced and stockpiled up to 2,000 tons of chemical warfare agents, which it used at least once during the Iran-Iraq war. Iran also has an active biological warfare program and is trying to buy biological agents from Europe that could be useful in developing such weapons, according to U.S. intelligence sources. Some U.S. experts believe that Iran already may have produced biological weapons in the form of toxins or anthrax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the West's chief worry is Iran's effort to develop nuclear weapons, which has been making steady progress under the cover of Iran's civilian nuclear power program. CIA Director John Deutch stated in November 1995 that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in as little as four years if it received extensive foreign assistance. American intelligence analysts have reported that Iranian acquisition teams have shopped for weapons-related nuclear equipment and nuclear scientists in the former Soviet Union, concentrating on Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In conclusion, although Iran now poses primarily an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat to American interests in the Middle East and the Muslim world, in the long run Iran will pose an increasingly grave military threat to the security of the U.S., American military forces in the Middle East, and American allies in the region.

<h3> What Are America's Vital Interests?</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner</a>, Ph.D.
<P>
Delivered February 6, 1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Tonight I would like to outline a conservative internationalist foreign policy anchored in the foundation of vital American interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I define those vital interests as developments that could concretely affect the security or economic future of America and our citizens. Before giving you my list of American vital interests, let me first touch upon the growing drift in U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. In other words, let's review current policy.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clinton's foreign policy has been formulated by a group of retreads from the Carter Administration who were uncomfortable, unconvinced, and therefore unsuccessful in waging the Cold War against the Soviet Union. They returned to office with Clinton and believed that they could successfully reorient American foreign policy to harness the American military for what they deemed to be virtuous crusades in far-flung regions of the world. But they neglected the fact that the American people supported distant interventions during the Cold War only on behalf of important American national interests, and specifically to oppose the spread of an expansionist, ideological, totalitarian system that was publicly committed to burying us.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
American foreign policy has drifted dangerously astray, especially since 1993. A large part of the problem is that the Clinton Administration appears to be incapable of distinguishing between America's vital interests and some liberal do-gooders' marginal interests. The Administration too often has resorted to questionable military interventions to promote its peculiar vision of American values in such countries as Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia, where there were no vital American interests at stake.
<p>
<b>The New World Order </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Remember the New World Order that some American foreign policy gurus were hoping to achieve?  The rest of us ordinary folks soon learned that it was long on new and short on order. Some of us have called this the age of chaos.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I can almost point to the very moment when American foreign policy began losing its purpose. It was that defining day in Moscow -- the day when the line at McDonald's became longer than the line at Lenin's tomb. That really happened, and when it did the communism versus capitalism argument was over. The tenor of the discussion in Russia went from "We will bury you" to "Do you want fries with that?"  But with it, too, went America's organizing purpose abroad. Our prior purpose had been containment of the Soviet Union and eventually, for us conservatives, liberation of the captive nations.
<P>
<b>Isolationist Right and Interventionist Left</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the United States has been searching for an intellectual framework for its foreign policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A band of conservative isolationists on the fringe wants America to withdraw from the world altogether, while a suddenly macho band of liberal interventionists seeks to remake Haiti, Rwanda, Somalia, and the rest of the world in its own preening self-image.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The isolationist right thinks that we have few vital interests and so we shouldn't join alliances, which only entangle us. The interventionist left distrusts America's power and our vital interests and seeks to deny them by putting our troops and interests under the authority of the United Nations. Both approaches reflect a defeatist attitude of an America in decline -- a pessimistic attitude that America cannot hold its own in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fringe isolationist right hides behind protectionism, having no confidence that the U.S. can compete in the international world economy. The interventionist left hides behind multilateralism, having no confidence that the U.S. can compete in values and in the integrity of its interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The real problem, it seems to me, is that neither group has any conception of America's true vital interests in the real world today.
<p>
<b>Clinton's Foreign Policy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's foreign policy reminds me of the man who said he wanted to take assertiveness training but that his wife wouldn't let him. It variously and alternately seeks to promote human rights, alleviate human suffering, recreate history by undoing coups, build Western-style nations in places that have no Western values, stop nuclear proliferation with vague unverifiable agreements, and advance democracy and international law while raising the planet's environmental conscience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When not engaged in these activities, the U.S. State Department, under mandates from earlier liberal Congresses issues reports on America's own human rights abuses and bemoans what it calls the historical and continuing oppression of African Americans, Native Americans, and Women Americans. Meanwhile, the U.S. foreign aid bill mandates that U.S. government agencies promote "harmony among diverse racial, religious, and ethnic groups" in foreign countries -- something we can't accomplish or even define at home. Elsewhere in our foreign aid program, it's mandated that we must "include the economic empowerment of women as a factor in the evaluation of projects and programs."  We're even supposed to stop discrimination by foreign governments against people with disabilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Currently, the ultimate foreign policy test is not the vital interests of the American people, but mushy compassion. I commend to you a scathing article in the current issue of the journal <I>Foreign Affairs</I> entitled "Foreign Policy as Social Work," which rakes the Clinton Administration over the coals for its feel-good foreign policy. Written by Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign policy scholar who is no conservative and initially supported the Clinton Administration, the article lambastes the Administration for a misconceived foreign policy that is aimed at relieving suffering in conflict-ridden regions of the world rather than promoting American national interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton presided over three failed military interventions in his first year in office which then set the tone and much of the agenda for this Administration's foreign policy. 
These were:
<P><ul>
<li> The announced intention and subsequent failure to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia and bomb the Bosnian Serbs in May 1993;
<p>
<li> The deaths of 18 U.S. Army Rangers in a failed Special Forces operation in Somalia in early October 1993; and
<p>
<li> The dispatch of a U.S. Navy ship carrying military trainers and its subsequent recall due to anti-American demonstrations in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in mid-October 1993.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Clinton, American foreign policy has been transformed into an international social welfare program. Clinton has expended billions of dollars and scores of American lives in these naive military interventions in Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti -- three countries where the U.S. has no vital interests at stake.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Somalia, the Clinton Administration inherited a humanitarian intervention designed to feed starving Somalians. But while President Bush sent American troops to Somalia to feed people, President Clinton clumsily escalated the mission into a doomed scenario called "nation-building."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Bosnia, Clinton has zigged and zagged so many times, nobody is sure what U.S. policy actually is. But the same mission creep that led to disaster in Somalia is built into the ambiguous U.S. intervention in Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Haiti, Clinton has chosen to commit the U.S. to bring stability and democracy by working with an unstable leader, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in a country that has never had a stable democracy. Slowly, it is dawning even on the President that the only way to sustain Aristide in office is to extend the stay of U.S. troops in Haiti. Our troops have become Aristide's palace guard. The intervention has already cost an estimated $1.9 billion. This is the equivalent of almost $300 for each of Haiti's 6.5 million people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration is a hawk on Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia -- in other words, causes that require only small-scale military actions, enjoy the cover of U.N. approval, and serve no clear-cut strategic interest of the United States. And yet it is a dove when it comes to standing up to North Korea, Iran, or some other hostile power that genuinely does threaten U.S. vital interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That is not all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's feel-good foreign policy focuses on peripheral international issues, often to curry favor with special-interest domestic political constituencies. For example, the Administration actively has intervened in Haiti to court African-Americans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These politically motivated actions are not only an unnecessary waste. They also come at the expense of important American foreign policy interests and defense needs. Humanitarian interventions and nation-building experiments have diverted attention from key items on the American foreign policy agenda.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These key items include:
<p><ul>
<li> Bilateral relations with Russia, whose recent elections have underscored a growing anti-Western backlash;
<p>
<li> China, which is becoming increasingly aggressive and belligerent in East Asia;
<p>
<li> Iran, whose clandestine nuclear efforts and continued export of terrorism have led Congress to seize the initiative and force the Administration to impose trade sanctions;
<p>
<li> NATO, whose future now has become entangled with the future of Bosnia, a military quagmire of uncertain resolution;
<p>
<li> Missile defense, a critical element of national defense that the Administration has woefully neglected; and
<P>
<li> The promotion of free trade, which the Administration allowed to fall by the wayside when it failed to gain fast-track negotiating authority for expanding NAFTA to include Chile.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, the expanding commitment of U.S. military forces to far-flung humanitarian and peacekeeping operations has stretched thin our military forces around the globe. These commitments have also undermined our ability to respond to dangerous threats to our vital interests elsewhere. A recent article in the <I>Washington Times</I> reported that Pentagon officials are concerned that the commitment of 30,000 American troops to Bosnia and the surrounding region will seriously undermine our ability to repel aggression in the Persian Gulf or on the Korean peninsula -- you see, in military and foreign policy, everything is connected to everything else. Thus, the diversion of U.S. combat troops to peacekeeping operations depletes our strategic reserves. It erodes military readiness by interfering with training to sharpen warfighting skills.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the concerns of the Pentagon, the Administration is now considering an additional peacekeeping operation -- the deployment of U.S. troops to the Golan Heights if a peace treaty is signed by Israel and Syria. Such a deployment is dangerous. It will be either too small to defend itself if another Middle East war erupts or too big, further straining our ability to meet other military contingencies around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, it will be an inviting target for a group of terrorists -- or an official party to the treaty (I refer to Syria and not, of course, to Israel). I say inviting target because the U.S. troops would be an especially attractive "trip wire" to bring the U.S. into the conflict or to drive the U.S. home, out of our more appropriate role in the Middle East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, America now has a foreign policy as chaotic as the world itself. I do not believe such a policy can possibly offer the leadership that is needed to protect American interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have a policy of good intentions, as defined by a bunch of mushy-minded liberals. But in foreign policy, good intentions are not enough. We all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. As Mandelbaum noted in his article, "While Mother Teresa is an admirable person and social work a noble profession, conducting American foreign policy by her example is an expensive proposition."  And, I might add, an ineffective and inefficient one at that.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So what is to be done?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
My friends, first of all, the left-liberals in America need to get over this notion that it's somehow embarrassing or even immoral to have vital global interests. The isolationists need to get over the idea that, with Soviet communism gone, we no longer have global interests. The fact is, the United States is a global power. Responsibility as a global power requires us to behave like a global power. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We can protect neither our interests nor our values unless we remain a global power. As we approach the 21st century, we must apply the lessons we learned in the 20th century: It is too dangerous for us to hide and to put our heads in the sand.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe the world longs for America's leadership, the kind of leadership that led Ronald Reagan to stand there in Berlin in 1987 and demand, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"  Each day we find out more and more from Soviet archives how it was U.S. strength that freed the people of the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe the world is a freer, safer, more stable place when the U.S. is actively pursuing its own vital national interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Leadership that we have because we are the world's only remaining superpower -- 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Militarily:</b> America's blue water Navy helps safeguard access to free trade and natural resources not just for the U.S., but for all nations. The guarantee of U.S. military support for the NATO alliance is critical to Europe remaining a free and prosperous community of nations. But that does not mean the U.S. should get involved in a local conflicts like the one in Bosnia. Resolving that thorny crisis is a European interest, not an American interest
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Economically:</b> Not only is the U.S. economy the world's largest, but Americans lead the world economy as both importers and exporters.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Educationally:</b> I don't need to tell you how many students from around the world come to America to study. When these students return home, they take with them experiences that bolster free ideas and free markets in their countries -- and that benefits us all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Technologically:</b> America leads the world in inventions and innovations of all kinds, and the whole world benefits. Look at the personal computer, soon to be as common and affordable as the television set. This tool empowers people everywhere to tap into the enormous wealth of information on the Internet and to share ideas unimpeded by national boundaries.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Entrepreneurially:</b> America's corporations know better than anyone how important it is to remain flexible in a global economy. Hence they are constantly innovating, finding ways to do more, to do it better, and to do it with fewer resources. When the world's largest economy does these things, it is felt around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Culturally:</b> You can travel anywhere in the world and see vivid signs of American culture like popular music and movie stars. Less vivid but more enduring, however, are the ideas of democracy and free markets that the United States has been sharing with the other nations of the world for over two centuries, helping to make the world safer and more prosperous for everyone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe that when America's vital interests are served, so are the values of political and economic freedom worldwide, because to the extent that America is a strong leader protecting its values, those same democratic values are safer and more vital elsewhere in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Here, briefly, are what I believe America's interests to be.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #1: Safeguard U.S. national security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This means, above all, to protect America's territory, borders, and airspace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our borders are not threatened by the likes of Haitian boat people -- a situation created by our own economic embargo of that poor, desperate country. No, the biggest threat to the United States remains long-range missiles armed with nuclear weapons. Our response to this threat should include an anti-missile defense and a broad nonproliferation policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration vetoed Congress's defense bill recently, largely because it contained an aggressive program for building missile defenses for America by the year 2003. Yet Secretary of Defense William Perry just last month finalized plans for building a missile defense system for Israel in five years, using existing technology. To quote Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, "it will be a great contribution to the security" of the Middle East. But I believe it is inconsistent -- no, it is mad for the United States to help allies to defend themselves against missile attacks while denying our own citizens that same capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A broad nonproliferation policy also should be a vital component of American foreign policy. If diplomacy fails to discourage hostile powers from acquiring nuclear weapons, our vital interest could warrant the use of force -- unilaterally if necessary -- to stop renegade nations from becoming nuclear powers. I believe the civilized world would sigh with relief if we decided to eliminate those facilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This also means maintenance of the necessary conventional forces to protect our homeland.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #2: Prevent a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, or the Persian Gulf.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Here threats include expansionist activities by Russia against her neighbors, an expansionist Iraq or Iran, or a nuclear-armed North Korea. And we should not focus simply on immediate threats. Today radical nationalism, Islamic fundamentalism, and -- although not as threatening as its original version -- neocommunism exist in places where the U.S. has vital interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Regarding Europe, it is a false economy to withdraw any more of our 100,000 troops just because Russia is not an immediate danger. To those who say, "Well, we'll just come back if or when Russia is a threat again," I say, "You mean like we did in 1944 on the beaches of Normandy?"  And to those who ask, "Why should America pay anything to defend Europe or East Asia?"  I say, "We're not paying for Europe's defense or Japan's defense. We're paying for <I>our</I> defense."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Far better to keep 100,000 troops in Europe to maintain the peace than to send a million later to fight a war started in our absence. Far better to enter into strategic alliances -- like NATO and our mutual defense treaties with Japan and South Korea -- than to try to go it alone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A word about China: The rulers in Beijing must learn that it is in the national interest of the U.S. to stay a permanent Pacific power. This means that we will not tolerate any forcible activity from mainland China against Taiwan. Taiwan is much more than our 7th-largest trading partner. She has also become the model for a vigorous, democratic, free-market society in Asia. We will not tolerate an invasion, blockade, or aggressive activity by mainland China against Taiwan.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #3: Maintain access to foreign trade.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The greatest danger here comes not from outside U.S. borders but from inside, from those who fear America cannot compete. The protectionists who opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and GATT are pessimists about America's future. They favor the low-paying textile jobs of the past over the higher paying technology jobs of tomorrow. They are blind to the regenerative power of the free market, which they believe in devoutly for the domestic economy but not for the world economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
GATT was central to the Reagan and Bush agendas because those administrations recognized that the U.S. is the world's largest exporter, not just the world's largest economy. Yet some Republicans seem to forget this, and some of them even have edged toward playing politics with free trade. I hope those Republicans return to the party's long tradition of seeking open markets for the benefit of both U.S. consumers and U.S. exporters.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation supported the Clinton Administration on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and we supported it on GATT. We will continue to support further efforts toward expanded free trade, such as expanding NAFTA to include Chile as the next step.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I have confidence that our great nation, with our great people, can compete economically with any country. I am distressed by those who don't have this confidence in America, that we can compete and win.
<P>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #4: Protect Americans against threats to their lives and well-being.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. has an obligation whenever possible to protect American citizens from terrorist activity and other international criminal activity. Yet, if a recent incident is any indication, I don't think the U.S. State Department quite understands this elementary concept.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Terry Anderson, who was held hostage for seven years by Lebanese terrorists, wrote a book on his captivity entitled <I>Den of Lions</I>. While he was writing it, the U.S. State Department refused to turn over any documents it had on his captors for two years because -- get this -- it felt compelled to protect their privacy!  The State Department said it could not give Anderson the documents unless he received written permission from the terrorists for the information's release.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is it any wonder the State Department seems to have a problem sorting out America's vital interests?  As the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, wrote to Secretary of State Christopher on the day after our seismic November 1994 elections, "It's about time there was an American Desk at the Department of State."
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #5: Maintain access to resources.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy depends on foreign oil, which now accounts for more than 50 percent of America's oil consumption and is expected to provide an increasing share of future oil consumption. A threat to our oil supply is a threat to our national interest. Tour the oil fields of Kuwait, as I did three months ago, and you will see first-hand why we must maintain our access to vital natural resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reduced to their basics, then these are America's five vital interests.
<P>

<b>Assertive Multilateralism: A Liberal Oxymoron</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Liberals, of course, often believe that where the U.S. has real interests is exactly where we should tread the lightest because these interests are somehow unseemly. As a result, America's foreign policy recently has pursued what is called "assertive multilateralism" -- a contradiction in terms if I've ever heard one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me add that using force multinationally is no more moral than wielding it unilaterally. The U.N. is filled with governments and dictatorships that do not represent the wills of their people. Why is the U.N. more moral than the U.S. Congress?  Yet President Clinton sought and received U.N. approval for invading Haiti but skipped the U.S. Congress. I believe multilateralism is the abandonment of America's leadership role in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, beyond these vital interests I've just mentioned, America has a number of other important interests, as well as many marginal ones, constantly tugging at us. The U.S. has an important interest in promoting democracy and free markets abroad, especially in regions where old totalitarian or authoritarian empires have collapsed. The more democratic the world becomes, the more peaceful it becomes, and therefore the more congenial for U.S. values and interests. Public diplomacy -- that is, reaching out above governments to tell America's story to the world -- is an important tool for promoting American interests and values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The problem, however, is that the marginal interests -- not the vital ones -- have been driving our foreign policy. This has undermined U.S. credibility abroad and casts doubt on the steadfastness of American foreign policy in many places. This situation will not endure. I'm reminded of what Winston Churchill said during World War II: "You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, but only after they exhaust all other opportunities."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So, in closing, I believe the United States eventually will do the right thing and recognize our own vital interests. We need not deny these interests. The world need not fear them. They are a stabilizing force for peace and prosperity. That we believe in democracy, freedom, and the power of open markets is something of which we should be proud, not ashamed. We should reassert this in a positive and forthright way. Maintaining the strength and the coherent international principles to protect those values is not a luxury. Rather, it is an obligation of the federal government written into our Constitution. It is the most basic obligation of all: "to provide for the common defense... and secure the blessings of liberty."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The poet Carl Sandburg wrote of American destiny that "Always there arose enough reserves of strength, balances of sanity, portions of wisdom to carry the nation through to a fresh start with ever renewing vitality."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe America's vitality and leadership abroad will return, but I think it will take a change of administration to accomplish this. It is a challenge and an opportunity that we, as a great nation, cannot afford to let pass.

<title> Tax Limitation Amendment</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<h2><i>Tax Limitation</i></h2> <br>		             
</center>

Although April 15th is always an important day in the Unites States, this year, this day will earmark a hopeful turn of events.  The Tax Limitation Amendment, one of the first reform acts of the 104th Congress, will go to the House floor on April 15th.  Sponsored by over 166 Representatives, this amendment would require Congress to have a two-thirds majority vote in each house to approve tax-rate increases. <p> 

Senator Kyl (R-AZ) is the driving force behind the amendment for the Senate.  Senator Kyl has proposed that if this bill passes it would need ratification by 38 states in order to become the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. <p>

One of the key factors to passing this bill would not only make it harder for Congress to raise taxes, but would force lawmakers to prioritize government spending.  The bill was written to encourage the elimination of lower priority programs to pay for new proposals as opposed to seeking finances through raised taxes. <p>

Recent surveys and studies have shown that the majority of American voters support the Tax Limitation Amendment.  The bill has also received tremendous backing from many high profile organizations, such as the American Conservative Union, the Christian Coalition, Citizens Against Government Waste, Family Research Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. <p>

Below is a layout of the proposed bill and some of the key reasons why it would stabilize tax laws: <p>

 <p> <br> <br> <br> 
					
					<center>April 15 Floor Vote </center> <p>

Section 1.<p>
	Any bill to increase taxes by increasing the rate or base of any tax may pass only by a two-thirds majority of the whole number of each House of Congress. <p>

Section 2.<p>
	Waiver during periods of declared war or imminent and serious threat to national security declared by a joint resolution.  Any provision which passed subject to the waiver shall last no more than 2 years. <p>

Section 3.<p>
	All votes will be roll call votes. <p>

<p> <br>  <br> 

				 <center>	Talking Points </center> <p>
<ul>
<li>The Kemp Commission on Tax Reform endorsed a 2/3rds super-majority requirement for tax increases. It is an essential part of any tax reform.<p>

<li> One-third of all Americans live in a state with tax limitation in their constitutions: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.  Other states are pursuing similar measures. <p>

<li> In the last decade, taxes in non-super-majority states went up 104%.  In super-majority requirement states, tax revenues went up only 87%. <p>

<li> In the last decade, spending in non-super-majority states went up 102%.  In states with the super-majority protection, spending increased only 95%. <p>

<li> It must be more difficult for future Congresses to raise taxes. Because federal benefits tend to be targeted at specific groups, special interest groups consistently come together to effectively lobby for more spending.  Taxes, on the other hand are spread among many millions of people who would find it difficult to band together as an interest group. The built-in pressure in a democracy is toward more spending.  The super-majority provision successfully balances the pressure. <p>

<li> Four of the last five major tax increases were passed with less than a two-thirds super-majority.  Those taxes added an additional $666 billion to the tax bill for the American taxpayer. <p>

<li> On Day One of the 104th Congress, the House voted 279-152 for a super-majority requirement to raise income taxes -- 11 votes shy of two-thirds.  This important protection, though, only applies during the 104th Congress, and only to the House. <p>

Telecommunications and Finance of the Commerce Committee<br></b><P>
Testimony of <a href="/pff/people/afellow.html#Pitsch">Peter K. Pitsch</a>
<P><br>

<B>Summary of Testimony</B>
<P>
 Important as the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is, important systemic
telecommunications reforms are still needed.  Although some federal and state
regulation remains appropriate, experience has now shown that industries
governed by market forces generally work better than government-run or
regulated ones:<p>
<ul>
<li>    Markets produce objective information on how consumers and producers value
resources and strong incentives to act on this information.  The FCC's delay
of cellular is estimated to have cost America over $80 billion.<p>
<li>    Competitors often use the regulatory process  to delay innovation and
competition by several years or even decades.  Consider customer premises
equipment, long distance yesterday and today, cable, video dial tone, VHF
drop-ins, low power TV, and DBS.<p>
<li>    The pace of technical change, especially regarding digital technologies,
has increased the cost of regulation.  Digital technologies make most
regulatory distinctions between voice and data and video just plain silly.
In accordance with these principles, much of the FCC's current responsibility
should be devolved to the states, transferred to the Department of Justice
and most important of all committed to the marketplace, in the end the true
agency of consumer protection.<p>  
</ul>
First, most federal price and profit regulation of telecom markets should be
eliminated, either because the relevant markets are effectively competitive,
regulation is better left to the states, or such federal regulation is
counterproductive.  Possible forbearance targets recommended by some members
of  the Progress & Freedom Foundation Working Group are attached to my
testimony.  They include tariffing, service bundling, and self-certification
reforms.<p>
Second, the electromagnetic spectrum should be largely privatized. Existing
spectrum licensees should be given freedom to use their spectrum as they see
fit as long as they do not interfere with other licensees--their cochannel
and adjacent channel neighbors.  Unallocated private and underutilized
federal spectrum should be made available in flexible assignments through
auctions.  A detailed proposal for reforming the electromagnetic spectrum
developed by members of the PFF Working Group is attached to my testimony.
Third, much of the FCC's general public interest authority is better
exercised elsewhere.  Attempts to address the broader public interest by
assuring there is adequate children's programming, by regulating mergers, or
by conducting international negotiations should be handled by Congress or
state legislatures in explicit actions or by other agencies such as the
Department of Justice or State.<p>
The case for dramatic reform is now more compelling than ever before.
 Growing global competition, merging markets, and the revolution in digital
and related technologies make the unintended and untoward effects of
government regulation far more costly than in the past.  A regulatory
framework that slows innovation in this area, despite any plausible shortrun
efficiency gains it might achieve, will foreclose a tremendous opportunity
for the American people.
<P><br>

<P>
<B>Testimony</B>
<P>
Introduction<br>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It is an honor to be here to testify before this
Committee about the restructuring of the Federal Communications Committee.
 As you know I worked at the FCC for eight years in the 1980s, first as Chief
of the Office of Plans and Policy then as Chief of Staff to Chairman Dennis
Patrick.  Since then I have been in private practice, an adjunct professor at
Georgetown University Law Center, and an adjunct fellow at The Hudson
Institute and The Progress & Freedom Foundation.  I am a member of the PFF
Working Group that last May proposed eliminating most of the FCC's current
functions over the next three years.  Today I am representing PFF and myself
and no one else.<p>
This Congress and this Committee are to be congratulated for passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 which creates a new legal and policy playing
field based on the presumption that competition, open entry and market forces
should regulate the telecom industry.  Important as that legislation is, and
it is the most important telecommunications legislation of the last 60 years,
important telecommunications reforms are still needed.  Some might benefit
from legislation.  Others only require diligent oversight by this Committee.
I want to address four broad points.  First,  I want to lay out the case for
 reform.  Second, I will list the structural reforms that should be
implemented over time.  Third, I will discuss reforms that the FCC should
undertake today.  Finally, I want to stress the importance of these reforms
to the American people.<p>
Before I begin I want to be clear about what I am saying and not saying: <br>
<ul>
<li>	I am not here to proclaim the end of communications history.  I am not
saying that all communications regulation by all agencies, federal and state,
is inappropriate.  <p>

<li>	Nor am I saying that my policy prescriptions could be implemented
overnight.  Indeed, even with a free hand, it might take two or three years
to transition to a new system.  As an aside,  additional resources should be
given to the FCC to meet the legislation's mandates, but only if this
Committee is satisfied that the FCC is doing everything it should to pare
back through forbearance and privatization. <p>

<li>	My message is not partisan.  My criticisms of the FCC are systemic.  They
cross administrations.  They span the decades.  Time and again and to this
day well intentioned regulation has hurt consumers, often the poor and those
least well represented in the Washington regulatory game.<p>

<li>	Lastly, because in my eight years at the FCC I got to know many FCC
employees first hand, it is important to me to make explicit that my comments
are not intended to be a criticism of  FCC employees, who perform their jobs
in an exemplary fashion.  The cost of the FCC is not salaries.  The
overriding costs of the FCC are the foregone benefits of competition and
innovation.<p>

Why Dramatic Reform Is Needed<br>
Why replace the FCC?  What's wrong with regulation?   Experience has now
shown us that industries governed by market forces generally work better than
government-run or regulated ones--competition regulates prices and profits
better than the administrative process.  Markets produce objective
information on how consumers and producers value resources and strong
incentives to both to act on this information.  <p>
Regulation, in contrast, comes up short on both counts.  Regulators lack the
necessary information and the proper incentive needed to make prudent
decisions that will most benefit consumers.<p>
Consider spectrum allocation decisions, e.g., the cellular mobile radio and
VHF television allocations were billion dollar debacles.  The FCC's delay of
cellular is estimated to have cost America over $80 billion.  Consider too
the government's current  use of the 6 to 10 GHz of spectrum below 30 GHz
spectrum.  Most experts outside government believe that that spectrum is
underutilized.  <p>
A second failing of the regulatory process is that it is often used by
competitors to delay innovation and competition by several years or even
decades.  Few companies and no trade association can resist the temptation to
use the regulatory process to stymie a competitor or delay a new entrant.
 Most of those efforts have injured consumers.  When it comes to
communications pleadings H.L. Mencken's quip is surely right, &quot;It may be a
sin to think evil of others, but it is seldom a mistake.&quot;  Again let's look
at the record.  It's replete with examples of where regulation impeded
competition and new service such as customer premises equipment, long
distance yesterday and today, cable, video dial tone, VHF drop-ins, low power
TV, and DBS.  <p>
The pace of technical change, especially regarding the digital technologies,
has increased the cost of regulation.  In the old days it was ridiculous for
the FCC to allocate land mobile frequencies on a nationwide basis to narrow
industries, such as taxis and forestry management.  The inevitable
consequence was an overallocation of frequencies to taxis in Boise and an
underallocation in New York City and vice versa for forestry management
frequencies.  Digital technologies make most distinctions between voice and
data and video just as silly and far more expensive.<p>
What Structural Reforms Are Needed<br>
What's the answer?  As this Committee and Congress have recognized in the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is to rely more on market forces.  Where
regulation is necessary to check market power, it should seek to preserve the
information-producing  and feedback mechanism of the marketplace.  Subsidies
should be explicit and competitively neutral to minimize their distortive
effect.  Deferring to state regulators and employing case-by-case mechanisms
such as the common law rather than imposing nationwide structural rules will
maximize the opportunity for experimentation.<p>
In accordance with these principles, the current FCC should be replaced with
a much smaller federal agency.  Much of the FCC's current responsibility
should be devolved to the states, transferred to the Department of Justice
and most important of all committed to the marketplace, in the end the true
agency of consumer protection.<p>
FCC regulation can be divided into three parts.  First, there is utility
regulation, that is, the regulation of natural monopoly and universal
service.  Most federal price and profit regulation of telecom markets should
be eliminated, either because the relevant markets are effectively
competitive, regulation is better left to the states, or such federal
regulation is counterproductive.  States should be given principal
responsibility for defining universal service and any federal universal
service subsidies should be made explicit and means-tested.  Regulation of
local exchange facilities should be devolved to the states, subject to
federal guidelines necessary to the development of local competition  and the
assurance that interstate users of local exchange facilities have non
discriminatory access.  I discuss possible forbearance targets below.  
Second, the management of the electromagnetic spectrum should be largely
privatized.  Electromagnetic spectrum allocation decisions should be made
principally by private parties in the marketplace.  Existing spectrum
licensees should be given freedom to use their spectrum as they see fit as
long as they do not interfere with other licensees--their cochannel and
adjacent channel neighbors.  Unallocated private and underutilized federal
spectrum should be made available in flexible assignments.  The assignment of
spectrum should be made through the use of auctions where there are competing
applicants.  I have attached  a detailed proposal for reforming the
electromagnetic spectrum developed by members of the PFF Working Group.  
Third, much of the FCC's general public interest authority is better
exercised elsewhere.  Attempts to address the broader public interest by
assuring there is adequate children's programming, by regulating mergers,  or
by conducting international negotiations should be handled by  Congress or
state legislatures in explicit actions or other agencies such as the
Department of Justice or State.  Regulation of mergers should be done through
antitrust enforcement, not structural rules.  Any federal regulation of
programming content should be by explicit subsidy through legislation or
enforcement in federal court.<p>

Forbearance Actions That Can Be Taken Immediately<br>
The Commission should immediately undertake several deregulatory initiatives
that would benefit consumers, promote competition, and reduce its budgetary
needs.  Some of these initiatives are made possible, indeed required, by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.   Section 401 of the new law adds a new
provision to the 1934 Communications Act, as amended (new 47 U.S.C. section
160) which requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to forbear
from regulating telecommunications carriers or services, under certain
circumstances.  Other initiatives, especially those that do not pertain to
telecommunications services, can be done under previous Commission authority
and discretion.  For example, the Commission can use self certification and
updated licensing procedures to speed up license transfers and reduce its
resource needs.  Other functions, especially handling public inquiries, could
be streamlined and possibly privatized. <p>
As the Commission seeks to promote competition, it should not delay the
forbearance process.  These and other initiatives should be taken to begin
the FCC's smooth transition to a competitive environment.  Congress should
give the FCC  flexibility to adjust its processes and move its personnel to
expedite this process.  An initial list of forbearance and privatization
proposals prepared by members of the PFF Working Group is attached.  Some of
those recommendations are:<br>
Private Carriage Contracts.  Private carriage promotes competition, the
satisfaction of customers' demand for tailored offerings, and the avoidance
of unnecessary regulatory costs.  There is no good reason to require AT&T,
MCI, Sprint, or other long distance firms to file single-customer offerings.
 Typically, these single-customer offerings appeal to the largest
communications customers, firms which spend millions (and, in several
instances, hundreds of millions) of dollars annually, and which have large,
sophisticated in-house communications staff.  Extensive FCC tariffing
requirements thus serve little of the customer protection role traditionally
associated with tariffing.  Instead, those requirements have become at best
an unneeded  expense and, at worst, a means of price signaling and
coordination.<p>

Computer Inquiry Rules.  The new forbearance law should be applied to
Computer Inquiry rules that prohibit carriers from bundling various services
and equipment and impose other unnecessary requirements.  For example, all
long distance and regional Bell operating companies are prohibited from
bundling basic services with either customer premises equipment or enhanced
services.  Also, AT&T and the Bell companies must:<br>
<ol>
<li> get prior FCC approval of enhanced affiliates' interconnection plans.<p>
<li> disclose changes in basic network interfaces.<p>
 <li> file non-discrimination reports allocate joint and common costs incurred in the provision of basic and
enhanced services.<p>
<li>  In all these cases, where the FCC determines the basic
service involved is effectively competitive, the regulation is no longer
necessary or productive.<p>   
</ul>
Dominant Carrier Reforms.  Steps should be taken to simplify FCC price and
profit regulation of telecommunications companies still deemed to command
&quot;market power.&quot;  The FCC needs to move toward a regime of price, not profit
regulation, by adopting a &quot;pure&quot; incentives-based (&quot;price caps&quot;) regulatory
system, along the lines followed by Britain's progressive Office of Telecommunications. 
 The FCC's current approach &quot;caps&quot; permissible prices for
&quot;interexchange access&quot; based on a complicated formula keyed to the prevailing
rate of inflation and forecasted productivity attainments.  But it also
requires local exchange carriers to &quot;share&quot; profits above a pre-determined
level with customers.  By focusing on the appropriate productivity factor and
eliminating the &quot;sharing formula,&quot;  the FCC could discard all the
paraphernalia associated with traditional rate-base or rate-of-return
regulation, such as depreciation regulation and cost allocation rules.
<p>
Sea Change in Approach.  In every telecommunications proceeding underway, the
FCC should ask if the relevant market is competitive.  If so, it should
refrain from regulating or consider how it can adapt regulation to promote
rather than hinder competition.  An illustration of the need for a dramatic
change in outlook is the FCC's proposal to impose mandatory resale on paging
operators.  That  market has numerous competitors and no serious observer
contends that it is not effectively competitive. <p>
This approach should also be taken as to the rulemakings required by the new
law.  Two examples include the rulemakings the FCC must undertake to promote
geographic averaged rates and universal service.  Imposing geographically
averaged rates is inconsistent with competition.   Long distance competition
could be distorted by companies limiting their activities to low cost
regions.  In that case national carriers might find it difficult to compete
in those areas.  Under the forbearance section, the FCC should find that
competitive concerns require any geographic averaging of rates to be limited
and transitional. Similarly, universal service subsidies must be reduced and
targeted to those who need them.  Market-based mechanisms can be fashioned to
phase  out unnecessary subsidies that could distort and impede the
development of competition.<p>

License Transfers and other changes.  The Commission reviews the assignment
and transfer of all broadcast stations.  Instead, it could adopt a
self-certification approach that would put the onus on the buyer who would
certify that all the relevant statutes and FCC regulations have been met.
 The FCC should where necessary clarify its regulations to ease the
certification process and use audits as the basis for determining compliance.
 Alternatively, the FCC could select a self regulating organization (SRO)
which could review all license transfers and assignments.  Self certification
of transfers and assignments would likely be supported by the industry as
evidenced by its endorsement by Broadcasting and Cable magazine.  
<p>
Why Reform Is Important<br>
We are all familiar with the rapid change in the computer industry.  In the
space of five years, IBM lost roughly $70 billion dollars of market
capitalization.  In the same period, many small hardware and software
companies grew exponentially, more than offsetting those mainframe losses.
 Who can seriously question the likelihood that if Apple, Intel, Compaq and
Microsoft had required FCC approval to get to the market, the personal
computer revolution would have been postponed.<p>
The case for dramatic reform is now more compelling than ever before.
 Growing global competition, merging markets and the revolution in digital
and related technologies make the unintended and untoward effects of
government regulation far more costly than in the past.  Heightened
competition has often undercut the rationale for regulation.  Moreover, the
increasing pace of change makes the costs of regulatory delay increasingly
unacceptable.<p>
Fundamental reform of the FCC would unleash innovative and entrepreneurial
forces and would build on the U.S.'s current but perishable lead in the
global digital derby.  Reform of the electromagnetic spectrum, alone, could
promote the development of competition in local telecommunications markets
and create a raft of new wireless digital services and devices.  America is
positioned to leave other countries in a cloud of silicon dust.  A regulatory
framework that slows innovation in this area, despite any plausible shortrun
efficiency gains it might achieve, will foreclose a tremendous opportunity
for the American people.<p>

<title>A Tax Code To Love? -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3> A Tax Code To Love?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>March 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Don't look now but it's that time of the year again. The dreaded tax season is here. To say that most Americans don't like the current tax system understates the obvious. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's because it truly is a mess. Americans struggle to comply with a tax system that has more than 400 different forms. The amount of time individuals and businesses spend collecting all the needed data and filling out all the required forms: an estimated 5 billion hours each year.  What a waste!
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	And compliance isn't cheap. Individuals, families and businesses spend an estimated $200 billion per year on accountants and lawyers to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service. Just think how crazy that is: The government will throw you in jail if you don't pay taxes according to a scheme it has made so confusing you have to hire a lawyer to figure it out! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There has to be a better way. And there is. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By now I'm sure you've heard all sorts of claims about an idea that is frequently discussed by economists, realtors, policy-makers and presidential contenders alike: the flat tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Just so you know, the reason so many people in high places want you to reject the flat tax is because they are the ones leeching benefits from the current system, and they don't want anybody messing with their cash cow.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The flat tax works like this: All taxpayers would pay the same tax rate, for example, 17 percent. No confusing tax schedules, no steep accountants fees; just one form, the size of a postcard. The rich would pay far more in taxes than the everybody else -- contrary to critics' claims -- since, after all, 17 percent of a million dollars is a lot more money than 17 percent of $35,000. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90.html">study</a> by my colleagues at The Heritage Foundation recently showed that the flat tax <a href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/0waisdocid%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th.src%3ATEXT%3A79219%3A1%3Ddiamond%3A210%3B2%3DUSHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th%3B3%3D5136314%2079219%20/usr/wais/data/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th/tl04.house.jul95.wais.data%3B4%3Ddiamond%3A210%3B5%3DUSHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th%3B6%3D5136314%2079219%20/usr/wais/data/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th/tl04.house.jul95.wais.data%3B7%3D%2500%3B">proposed</a> by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., -- one of several proposals under consideration -- would lower taxes on all income groups, especially the poor and middle class. The plan's generous deduction, $33,000 for a family of four, would exempt most low-income households from any federal income tax. Some 24 million families that pay taxes now would pay none under the plan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Also, unlike the current system, which may tax the same dollar up to four different times (the personal income tax, the corporate income tax, the capital gains tax, and the estate tax), dividend and interest earnings from savings and investment would not be taxed. In other words, instead of being penalized for investing your money, you would be taxed just once 3/4 when you earn the money. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This would encourage more Americans to put their money to work in the economy -- and instead of dragging the economy down, the tax system would start revving it up.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Of course, one of the most attractive features of a flat tax is its simplicity. Everyone who has wrestled with a Schedule C or a 1040 form or has had to collect receipts for every charitable contribution in the mad rush to get everything in the mail by April 15 could simply -- and quickly -- fill out a postcard-sized form. What literally once required hours could be done in a few minutes during your lunch hour! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	But before you get too excited, remember: A lot of special interests don't want to part with the advantages (a tax break for this, a loophole for that, a deduction here, an allowance there) that the current tax system gives them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Practically everyone agrees that America's tax system needs a major overhaul. Instead of spending precious time cursing the tax code, perhaps our lawmakers will soon replace it with one that everyone (except the special interests, of course) can love.

<title>Lower Education --  Heritage Commentary</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h2>Lower Education</h2>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever wonder why most young people -- even those who have attended prestige colleges or universities -- don't seem to know a whole lot about life or the world around them? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It could be because in the headlong pursuit of top-rated sports teams, expensive, over-specialized research facilities, and -- let's be frank -- money, America's most prestigious colleges and universities have forgotten their basic task: to teach students something about history, literature, mathematics, the natural sciences, foreign language, philosophy and English. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reason most "Generation Xers" don't come away from college with such a "bottom-line" education is simple: It's no longer required of them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I don't make this accusation lightly. According to a study just released by the National Association of Scholars (NAS), America's leading schools of "higher" education have eliminated most of the core academic requirements once considered essential to a liberal-arts education. At the 50 colleges and universities identified by U.S. News & World Report as "America's best," the commitment to a structured general education "has largely vanished" over the past 30 years. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In short, there has been "a purging from the curriculum of many of the required basic survey courses that used to familiarize students with the historical, cultural, political and scientific foundations of their society," the NAS study shows.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Of course, the study merely quantifies what many of us have been observing about American education for decades: U.S. educators have forgotten what education is all about. According to NAS President Stephen Balch, America is "in danger of losing the common frame of cultural reference that for many generations has sustained our liberal, democratic society."  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to the NAS study, the number of top schools that require what we used to call "freshman English" has dropped to just over one-third. Only 12 percent still require math; only 34 percent require students to study science; only 2 percent require the study of history; only 4 percent have required courses in philosophy; and not a single one of the top schools requires students to study great literature.    
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even the school year has been shortened, from an average of 191 days in 1964 to only 156 classroom days in 1993. 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"To a considerable extent, the structured curriculum was dashed to pieces during the late 1960s and early 1970s when the rage in higher education was a radical libertarianism based on notions of `relevance' and the assumption that a special insight belonged to youth," the NAS study states. As a result, colleges and universities today "can no longer guarantee that students acquire a basic knowledge of their civilization and its heritage." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The product of all this, in the words of my late friend, philosopher <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklink.html">Russell Kirk</a>, is "lax institutions at which every lad and lass can succeed, because all standards for entrance or graduation have been swept away." We end up with students "able to ascertain the price of everything -- but the value of nothing." 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	That's what you get, dear parent, for $10,000 to $25,000 per year and rising, when you send your son or daughter to America's most prestigious colleges and universities.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	If I were you, before I spent that kind of money, I'd get my hands on the NAS study, send it to the president of the college or university your child has chosen, and demand a response.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<h2>FDA Reform</h2>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Comments by  Foundation President Jeff Eisenach  on ABC's Nightline</B><BR>
</CENTER>

<p>
"The United States is unambiguously still today, thank goodness, the leader in medical technology but that intelligence, that human capital is literally getting on an airplane and flying to Europe and setting up shop and setting up households in Europe.<p><p>

"We simply think the process should be decentralized, that much of the work should be moved out of the hands of government bureaucracies into efficient private sector agencies.  But the same level of safety and efficiency ought to be demanded – both by the private sector companies that are doing the certification and also the FDA and in its final approval.<p><p>

Dr. Eisenach was also quoted in the Wall Street Journal on this subject:  "The FDA, instead of being a 'certifier of products' would become a 'certifier of certifiers,' ensuring that the private entities uphold the agency's standards, he said."

<I><FONT SIZE ="+2">W</FONT>elcome</I> to the American Conservative Union's "Legislative Update" page.  On this page you will
find regular updates on the key legislation we are tracking, as the legislation moves from
introduction to subcommittee and committee hearings, subcommittee and committee markups,
and floor action in both the House and Senate.  On any given day, this is where you can get the
latest information available on the key issues conservatives care about.
<P>
As the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, founded more than three
decades ago, the ACU sees its proper role as being the grass-roots lobby for the entire
Conservative Movement.  As such, we are not a single-issue organization.  Our officers, staff, and
-- most importantly -- our members are motivated toward public policy activism by the shared
beliefs explained in the ACU Statement of Principles.
<P>
Because the ACU is a multi-issue, umbrella organization, we monitor and lobby on a wide range
of issues before the Congress.  For ease in tracking those various pieces of legislation, we have
broken them down into four general categories:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Economic and Budget issues (examples:  the Balanced Budget Amendment; the Tax
     Limitation Amendment; the Budget Resolution; tax legislation; health care reform
     legislation; legislation to raise the debt ceiling; the Mexico bailout; etc.)
<LI>Social and Cultural issues (examples:  the Crime Bill; welfare reform; a school prayer
     amendment; abortion legislation; homosexual rights legislation; educational choice; etc.)
<li>Foreign Policy and Defense issues (examples:  ballistic missile defenses; the United
Nations; Bosnia; Haiti; the foreign aid bill; the War Powers Act; etc.)
<LI>Institutional Reform issues (examples:  term limits; campaign finance reform; budget
     process reform; repeal of the 16th Amendment, which instituted the income tax; lobbying
     reform; etc.)

<title>Why the House Health Insurance Reform Bill Would Help Achieve True Health Care Reform - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>WHY THE HOUSE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM BILL WOULD HELP ACHIEVE TRUE HEALTH CARE REFORM</h3>
By John C. Liu<br>
<P>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 271<br>
March 26, 1996<br>
<p>
(Updating <I>Issue Bulletin</I> No. 222, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/ib222.html">"A Guide to Kassebaum-Kennedy,"</a> March 22, 1996.)
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House of Representatives soon will consider major health insurance reform legislation approved by the Committees on Commerce, Ways and Means, and Economic and Educational Opportunities.<sup>1</sup>  The Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996, a legislative proposal being coordinated by Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL), contains many of the structural improvements needed in today's health insurance market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reforms would enable Americans to keep their health insurance should they change or lose their jobs. They also would generate more genuine competition among insurance carriers and other health plan providers, thereby controlling costs through free-market forces. In addition to making health insurance more available and portable, the House proposal would address the more immediate and pressing concern facing millions of Americans -- the affordability of health insurance. It would do this by changing the tax treatment of health insurance, creating medical savings accounts (MSAs), and expanding tax relief for health insurance. This would give Americans more personal choice of health care services and make it possible for more families to own their health plans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Increasing the Availability of Insurance.</b> The House proposal would restrict the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny group health insurance coverage to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. The limitation period on preexisting conditions would be reduced by the length of time that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under any prior plan. In addition, the proposal would prohibit an insurance company from imposing any further preexisting condition exclusions if the employee had been covered under another group health plan at the time coverage was offered, and would prohibit health plans from excluding or canceling coverage for any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status. Thus, workers who changed jobs would no longer be subjected to waiting periods. The absence of portability in group health insurance, now confronting millions of workers who want to change jobs, would be alleviated in the proposed group-to-group provision.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More important, the House bill would help create a consumer-based health insurance system by making individual ownership of health policies much easier. Individuals would be guaranteed health insurance coverage if they met certain specific requirements.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of health insurance in the individual market would be achieved under the bill by forbidding insurance carriers from imposing eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. These rules would guarantee the portability of health insurance for workers and their families in the individual market. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who provides health insurance to another employer who does not will lose coverage. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The concern has been raised that a guaranteed issue requirement would sharply raise the premiums on individual-based policies. Estimates vary, with some projecting increases of 2 to 5 percent, and others placing the increase between 10 and 15 percent.<sup>3</sup>  Because real consumer choice and genuine market competition are virtually non-existent in today's distorted health insurance market, it is inevitable that premiums would increase somewhat in the individual market under a guaranteed issue requirement. And since only employer-based health insurance is completely tax free, individuals who purchase it on their own must pay the entire cost of the higher premiums in after-tax dollars. Without any change in this tax treatment, healthier-than-average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance under a guaranteed issue requirement, while unhealthy persons would be more likely to purchase coverage, driving up average premiums. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fortunately, the House proposal makes two key adjustments in the federal tax code that would help offset the increase in premiums.
<p><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1.) Medical savings accounts.</b> The bill creates medical savings accounts (MSAs). As drafted, MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a significant impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other forms of tax equity Congress should consider, such as the comprehensive system of tax credits proposed in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK) and Representative Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed, MSAs are a good start. They would provide an incentive for healthy individuals to purchase at least catastrophic health insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool to help offset the claims of future unhealthy enrollees.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2) An increased tax deduction for the self-employed.</b> Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. The House bill would increase the deduction to 50 percent by 2003.<sup>4</sup>  While this would help, the federal tax code would remain biased against employees in employer-based health plans who prefer the security of choosing and owning their own plan. The House thus should establish at least a 50 percent deduction for all individuals purchasing health insurance, not just the self-employed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Small Employer Pooling.</b> The House bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase insurance coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>5</sup>  Eighty-five percent of uninsured Americans are in households headed by a worker. The House proposal uses ERISA to preempt any state laws prohibiting groups of employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage through a multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House bill also would eliminate confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has helped insurance swindlers and bogus unions hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. The House proposal would clarify the law and give legitimate self-insured associations (including church plans, franchise networks, trade associations, and certain collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in a state permitting such practices. Alternatively, they could seek federal certification under the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Second, the House bill makes clear that entities created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business rather than ERISA. The states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage when attempting to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers. The wrong way to deal with this would be for Congress to create government-sponsored health insurance purchasing cooperatives and impose new federal regulations. By giving smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the economies of scale available under ERISA, the House proposal would make it much easier for small firms to obtain this expensive health insurance.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House legislation would be a big step toward genuine health care reform because it addresses the principal reason why Americans have been demanding health insurance reform -- their fear of losing current health benefits or being unable to afford coverage. Further, the bill begins to tackle the root cause of the financing problems -- the tax bias against purchasing health insurance outside an employer. By doing this, the House proposal would give Americans the desirable components of health care reform that were the casualties of the battle over the Clinton health plan:  availability, affordability, portability, and -- above all -- the security that comes with personally owned health insurance.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<ol><p>
<li>These three committees have jurisdiction over particular aspects of health insurance legislation. The Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee reported out H.R. 995 on March 6, 1996; the Ways and Means Committee reported out H.R. 3103 on March 19; and the Commerce Committee reported out H.R. 3070 on March 20. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on a final version combining specific provisions from these three bills on March 28, 1996.<p>
<li>Among these requirements:  1) The individual must have been covered under one or more group health plans for at least 18 months; 2) the individual is not eligible for coverage under another group health plan (new employer or spouse's employer); and 3) if eligible for COBRA coverage (or a similar state continuation of coverage program), the individual would have to have elected and exhausted such coverage.<p>

Lehnhard, Senior Vice President, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, testimony before the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. Senate, July 18, 1995.<p>
<li>It should be noted that a similar provision to increase the 30 percent deduction to 50 percent was passed by Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. This proposal was vetoed by President Clinton.<p>
<li>The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA, P.L. 93-406) prohibits states from treating self-insured firms as insurance carriers and making them subject to state regulations.

<body>
<center>
<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Whitewater</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Senator:<br>
        <p>

        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support an unlimited extension of the Special
        Whitewater Investigative Committee when the matter comes to the Senate floor this week.<p>
        
        While it is undeniably true that the Whitewater investigation has been going on for quite
        some time, it is also undeniably true that many in the Clinton White House and the
        Administration have displayed a callous, flagrant disregard for the subpoenas served on
        them.  On numerous occasions, documents subpoenaed months and even years ago have
        miraculously been &quot;discovered&quot; out of the blue.  Just in the past ten weeks, this has
        happened on four separate occasions, with the most recent &quot;discovery&quot; coming just a few
        days ago, when the White House released Counsel Bruce Lindsey's notes of a meeting
        long past.<p>
        
        No rational person could observe this pattern developing and not question whether or not
        the White House was complying fully with the Senate investigation, as the President
        promised it would.  Instead, it looks as if the White House has something to hide, and that
        someone there believes that if they just hold out long enough, the Senate committee will
        run out of time and money, and the danger -- whatever it might be -- will have passed.
        
        For that reason, we urge you to support not only an extension of the Whitewater
        Committee, but an indefinite extension.  Putting a time limit on it -- as some Democratic
        Senate leaders have suggested -- would merely tell anyone continuing to hold back
        documents how much longer they had to hide them before the threat was passed.<p>
        
        The American people want this investigation concluded, but they also want it concluded
        with no doubts left as to the facts of the matter.  Otherwise, the time and money spent
        already would be a waste.<p>
       
<Pre>
                          Yours sincerely,
        
        
               

                          David A. Keene
                              Chairman

<title>GAY 'MARRIAGE': HAWAII'S ASSAULT ON MATRIMONY</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolbl.gif">

<h1>Gay 'Marriage'</h1>
<h2><i>Hawaii's Assault on Matrimony</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>T</font>he Hawaii Commission on Sexual Orientation 
recently voted 5-2 to recommend that same-sex couples be granted 
identical legal status now conferred on married couples.  The majority 
report declared that the denial of the &quot;benefits&quot; of marriage
&quot;purely on the basis of gender&quot; is a violation of &quot;basic
human rights&quot; enshrined in Hawaii's constitution.[1]

<p>

While the Commission's recommendation is non-binding, it
coincides with other pro-homosexual activity in the judicial and
executive branches of Hawaii's state government.  If these efforts
succeed, the institution of marriage will not only be affected
in America's 50th state, but in the other 49 as well.

<p>

In making its recommendation, a majority of the Hawaii Commission
on Sexual Orientation concluded that denial of marriage licenses
to same-sex couples deprived applicants of legal and economic
benefits, including:

<p><ol>

<li>joint parental custody;<br>
<li>insurance and health benefits;<br>
<li>the ability to file joint tax returns;<br>
<li>alimony and child support; and<br>
<li>inheritance of property and visitation of a partner or child in 
the hospital.

</ol><p>

The majority also concluded that legalization of same-sex
&quot;marriage&quot; would be an economic boon to Hawaii, as homosexuals
would flock there to get married.  (Apparently, they ignored the
possibility that traditional honeymooners may choose another destination,
and that more than 97 percent of the population is heterosexual.)

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Making gay 'marriage' legal would<br>
impose it on all the citizens of<br>
Hawaii, and perhaps even on people<br>
in the rest of the United States.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The Commission's minority report took issue with virtually
every assertion made by the majority, and cited medical, social,
historical and legal authorities to make the case that same-sex
&quot;marriage&quot; would encourage homosexuality and therefore
aggravate health problems associated with homosexual behavior,
hurt the island state economically because of possible boycotts,
and undermine the moral fabric of Hawaiian society.  The report
charged the majority with bullying witnesses, altering the official
record of meetings, rudely interrupting minority members and
generally suppressing information.

<p>

The minority concluded that granting marital status to homosexuals
would imperil marriage itself and bring Hawaii into conflict with
the other 49 states.  Its recommendations:

<p><ul><i>

<li>The Legislature should adopt a Constitutional Amendment
preserving marriage and the marital partnership as between one
man and one woman as husband and wife.

<p>

<li>The legal and economic benefits conferred on married couples
in the state of Hawaii should not be extended to homosexual and/or
&quot;common law marriage&quot; couples because the cost is too
great.

<p>

<li>The legal and economic benefits conferred on married couples
in the state of Hawaii should not be extended to homosexual couples
for all the same reasons these benefits are not extended to unmarried
heterosexual couples engaged in &quot;common law marriage&quot;
in Hawaii.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b>
Other relationships have not been<br>
accorded the same status as marriage<br>
because they do not contribute in the<br>
same way to a community. No society<br>
can survive without marriages and<br>
families.
</b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li>Rather than extend marital benefits to homosexual couples,
the legislature should modify statutes defining family to include
all those who share a household, which would include homosexual
couples as families.  However, the cost of doing so must be analyzed.

<p>

<li>The legislature must create a very broad religious freedom
exemption covering religious institutions and individuals who
have religiously motivated objections to treating same-sex partnerships
as marriage-equivalents.

</i></ul><p>

The latter recommendations seem to be fall-back positions
in case the state goes ahead with some sort of change in family
status.  Recommendation &quot;D&quot; is an unwise move toward
redefinition of family, and is surprising in light of the minority's
conclusion that &quot;homosexuality is a psychological pathology
and should not be encouraged.&quot;[2]

<p>

Commissioner Lloyd James Hochberg, Jr., who voted in the
minority, told <i>The New York Times</i>, &quot;Why would we want
to take a pathological condition and make it the equivalent of
heterosexual marriage as a goal that society is teaching children?
Once homosexual marriage or domestic partnership is permitted,
the schools are going to have to teach that it's equivalent.&quot;[3]

<p>

<center><h3>Background</h3></center>

<p>

In May 1993, the Hawaiian Supreme Court ruled 3-1 in <i>Baehr
v. Lewin</i>[4] that the state's exclusion of same-sex couples from
marital status may be unconstitutional because it amounts to discrimination.
Two homosexual men had applied for a marriage license, were denied,
and then sued the state.  The case eventually made its way to
the state Supreme Court, which remanded it to a lower court with
instructions to the state to prove &quot;compelling state interests&quot;
for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples.

<p>

The lower court is expected to rule on the case in July 1996.
If the State of Hawaii loses the case, and the court thereby
legalizes same-sex marriage, it can appeal to the state Supreme
Court. But that is unlikely because the governor and the lieutenant
governor are on record as favoring same-sex marriage and/or domestic
partnerships (legal equivalency of marriage without the term 
&quot;marriage&quot;).

<p>

In April 1994, the Hawaiian legislature overwhelmingly passed
a bill (21-4 in the Senate and 36-12 in the House) reaffirming
the traditional one-man, one-woman definition of marriage.  If
the lower court rules for same-sex marriage, it would strike down
this state law.  A likely reaction would be a voters' drive for
a constitutional amendment to replace the stricken statute.  Meanwhile,
other states are already moving to protect the traditional definition
of marriage.

<p>

<center><h3>Majority v. Minority Reports</h3></center>

<p>

The minority report begins with a wry observation:  &quot;The
irony of this 'minority' report is that its conclusions actually
reflect the view of a majority of Hawaii's residents.&quot;[5]
Indeed, a series of polls revealed that two-thirds of Hawaiians
disapprove of same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot;[6] Even so, many observers
expect the liberal Hawaiian courts to mandate gay &quot;marriage.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Gay 'marriage' is an oxymoron, an<br>
ideological invention designed to<br>
appropriate the moral capital of<br>
marriage and family toward the goal<br>
of government-enforced acceptance of<br>
homosexuality. As such, the term is<br>
a counterfeit and a fraud.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Hawaii has earned a reputation for being on &quot;the cutting
edge&quot; of social experimentation.  It was the first state
to legalize abortion (1970), the first to ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment (1972) and the fifth to offer special employment protections
to homosexuals (1991).

<p>

The majority report, mimicking arguments used by homosexual
activists, compares the same-sex quest for marital status with
the civil rights struggle by black Americans.  Most prominently
cited is an interracial couple's victory in <i>Loving v. Virginia</i>.[7]
In that historic case, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws
preventing marriage between people of different races as violating
the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution.

<p>

But the court never came close to redefining the institution
of marriage itself, which is what would have to occur for same-sex
relationships to be accorded marital status.  The false equation
of a benign, nonbehavioral characteristic such as skin color with
an orientation based precisely on behavior finds no support within
the law.  Perhaps it is no wonder that the majority equates all
sexual behavior.  At the very first meeting of the commission
the majority voted to ban all discussion of homosexuality because
some members might find it offensive or inflammatory.[8] Thus, the
truth about homosexual behavior was deliberately kept out of 
the proceedings.

<p>

The majority report also cites a number of flawed studies
to give the impression that homosexuality and heterosexuality
are essentially no different and have no implications for health
or for the well-being of children.  The report provides no medical
data to sustain its assertion that &quot;testimonies stating [that]
the extension of benefits to same-gender couples would threaten
public health are inaccurate.&quot;  The report also states that
&quot;there is no evidence that children of gay and lesbian parents
develop any differently than [sic] the children of opposite-sex
parents.&quot;[9] In making this point, the report ignores considerable
evidence that children are more likely to experiment with homosexuality
or identify as homosexuals when raised in a homosexual household.[10]

<p>

The majority expresses an odd understanding of the role of
morality and the law when it states, &quot;[W]hile each person
has the right to practice their individual religious and moral
beliefs, they do not have the right to impose those on others.&quot;[11]
Making gay &quot;marriage&quot; legal would impose it on all
the citizens of Hawaii, and perhaps even on people in the rest
of the United States.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Same-sex 'marriage' threatens not<br>
only the integrity of the marital<br>
definition but also religious freedom.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The majority goes on to state, &quot;Under our constitutional
government the fact that some religious [sic] or churches condemn
same-sex marriages does not mean that those religious beliefs
can be imposed on others.&quot;[12] In the very next paragraph, the
report notes, &quot;The Buddhists asked the Commission to support
stable relationships between loving people regardless of whether
those people are the same gender.&quot;[13] So, while saying that
no religion can impose its beliefs on others,  the report openly
and unselfconsciously adopts the Buddhist position.  Incidentally,
the commission itself was formed, then regrouped, only after two
representatives from the Catholic Church and two Mormons were expelled 
on grounds of &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Societal Implications</h3></center>

<p>

In the 1970s, homosexuals unsuccessfully challenged marriage
laws in Minnesota, Kentucky and Washington state.  In the Minnesota
case, the state Supreme Court noted, &quot;The institution of
marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreating
and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the book
of Genesis....This historic institution is more deeply founded
than the asserted contemporary concept of marriage and societal
interests for which petitioners contend.&quot;[14]

<p>

Other relationships have not been accorded the same status
as marriage because they do not contribute in the same way to
a community. To put it bluntly, societies can get along quite
well -- in fact, better -- without same-sex sexual relationships,
but no society can survive without marriages and families.  In
fact, because the term &quot;heterosexual marriage&quot; is redundant,
the term &quot;marriage&quot; will mean in this essay what it
has always meant:  the social, legal and spiritual union of a
man and a woman.  &quot;Gay marriage&quot; is an oxymoron, an
ideological invention designed to appropriate the moral capital
of marriage and family toward the goal of government-enforced
acceptance of homosexuality. As such, the term &quot;gay marriage&quot;
is a counterfeit and a fraud.  It would undermine support for
marriage by ending marriage's unique legal and cultural status.
It would also undermine support for natural families, whose
foundation is marriage.

<p>

Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; threatens not only the integrity
of the marital definition but also religious freedom.  Although
the majority report recommends that religious institutions not
be forced to perform same-sex ceremonies, it offers no defense
for the conscientious Christian, Jew or Muslim (or Hindu or atheist,
for that matter) who will not legally recognize same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; Law carries the potential use of force against 
those who will not abide by it.  If a businessman declines to extend 
marital benefits to same-sex couples, the law would open him to lawsuits
and state coercion.  Schools would be forced to teach the acceptability
of gay &quot;marriage&quot; in family life courses.  Homosexuals'
efforts to adopt children would be made easier if marriage is
stripped of its unique status.

<p>

All institutions except specifically religious ones would
be subjected to state enforcement.  That would include Christian
bookstores, radio and TV stations, and other nondenominational
businesses owned by religious people.  And religious institutions
themselves may enjoy immunity only for a short time.  &quot;Religious
exemption&quot; implies that the policy itself is at odds with
the moral order, but when push comes to shove, the state often
prevails.  For example, the Supreme Court swept away Bob Jones
University's tax-exempt status because the college, citing religious
reasons,  prohibited interracial dating.  The justices said that
the state's compelling interest in ensuring equality overrode
the college's religious views.  Almost all Christians would view
the university's stance as unbiblical, but the point is that religious
freedom is at the sufferance of the courts, which are acting increasingly
like lawmakers instead of law interpreters.  Religious freedom
can be curtailed anytime a court decides the state wants to do
so for &quot;compelling&quot; reasons.  Religious exemptions,
therefore, are most likely a temporary step on the way to total
acceptance of homosexuality.

<p>

<center><h3>Other States Fight Back</h3></center>

<p>

A constitutional conflict looms should the Hawaii court legalize
gay &quot;marriage,&quot; because under the U.S. Constitution's
full faith and credit clause, states must accord reciprocity to
other states in such matters as marriage and drivers' licenses.
So, theoretically, a homosexual couple could marry in Honolulu,
move to California and demand that the Golden State recognize
their &quot;marriage.&quot;  Because states do vary in their marital
requirements (such as minimum age), the general rule has been
to apply the law of the state where the marriage was performed
to determine a marriage's validity,  unless it &quot;violates
the strong public policy&quot; of the state in which the couple
reside.[15]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Observers in some states have already moved to bolster this
common law protection by making the point more explicitly.

<p><ul>

<li>In March, 1995, Utah's legislators voted to deny recognition
of any out-of-state marriages that do not conform to Utah law.

<p>

<li>In South Dakota, a similar bill (H1184) passed the House
of Representatives but failed by one vote to get on the Senate
calendar.

<p>

<li>In Alaska, a bill was introduced in early 1995 to make clear
that &quot;marriage is a civil contract entered into by one man
and one woman.&quot;

<p>

<li>In Minnesota in 1993, a bill (H3016) which specified that
&quot;a marriage contracted between persons of the same gender
and recognized as valid in another state is not valid in this
state&quot; failed in a House committee.

<p>

<li>In New Hampshire in 1994, a bill (SB557) failed in a Senate
committee that would have barred recognition of  marriage &quot;between
persons of the same gender.&quot;  Even this might have proved
ineffective given the ongoing drive by feminists at United Nations-sponsored
conferences on women to redefine gender into no less than five
categories (male heterosexual, female heterosexual, male homosexual,
female homosexual and transsexual/bisexual).

<p>

<li>In early 1996, marriage protection bills were introduced in several 
state legislatures, including California, Idaho and Washington. 
Legislators in other states, such as Alabama, Virginia and Georgia, 
were preparing bills.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>The Importance of Definition</h3></center>

<p>

In all cultural struggles, a primary battleground is the
use of language.  Compromising the integrity of a term or phrase
can advance a particular agenda, or, at least, sow confusion
and uncertainty.  A term such as &quot;marriage&quot; can either
lose the power of its original meaning or be commandeered to mean
something entirely different.  In 1828, Noah Webster defined 
&quot;marriage&quot; as:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The act of uniting a man and woman for life; wedlock;  the
legal union of a man and woman for life.  Marriage is a contract
both civil and religious, by which the parties engage to live
together in mutual affection and fidelity, till death shall separate
them.  Marriage was instituted by God himself for the purpose
of preventing the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes, for domestic
felicity, and for securing the maintenance and education of children.
&quot;Marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled.
Heb. xiii.&quot;</i>[16]

</blockquote>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
One can no more 'expand' a definition<br>
or moral principle than one can<br>
continually expand a yardstick and<br>
still use it as a reliable measure.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A more recent (1981) <i>Webster's</i> definition retains
the essential elements of the earlier version:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage\ a: the state of being united to a person of the opposite
sex as husband or wife b: the mutual relation of husband and wife:
wedlock c: the institution whereby men and women are joined in
a special kind of social and legal dependence for the purpose
of founding and maintaining a family.</i>[17]

</blockquote><p>

No jurisdictional unit in the United States -- town, city,
or state -- recognizes same-sex couples as &quot;married.&quot;
In 1975, Boulder, Colorado granted a marriage license to a same-sex
couple, but it was struck down by a federal court in 1982. Protections
favoring marriage are built into the law and the culture because
of the central importance of the family unit as the building block
of civilization.  In 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court described marriage
&quot;as creating the most important relation in life, as having
more to do with the morals and civilization of a people than any
other institution.&quot;[18]

<p>

However, some jurisdictions are moving toward redefining
the family to include same-sex relationships, and there is a movement
within the legal community to overhaul the definitions of marriage
and family.  A note in the <I>Harvard Law Review</I> in 1991 advocated
replacing the formal definition of family with an elastic standard
based &quot;mainly on the strength or duration of emotional bonds,&quot;
regardless of sexual orientation.  The note recommends redefining
the family through &quot;domestic partner&quot; or family 
&quot;registration&quot; statutes that go beyond the limited benefits now 
conferred by existing domestic partnership laws so as to &quot;achieve 
parity&quot; between marriage and other relationships.[19]

<p>

In 1990, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos appointed lesbian
activist Roberta Achtenberg (later Assistant Secretary of the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under President
Clinton) to chair the Mayor's Task Force on Family Policy.  The
final report of the task force defines the family this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;A unit of interdependent and interacting persons, related
together over time by strong social and emotional bonds and/or
by ties of marriage, birth, and adoption, whose central purpose
is to create, maintain, and promote the social, mental, physical
and emotional development and well being of each of its 
members.&quot;</i>[20]

</blockquote>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
This definition is so vague that<br>
multiple-partner unions are not<br>
excluded, nor any imaginable<br>
combination of persons, including<br>
a fishing boat crew. The whole<br>
point is to demote marriage to a<br>
level with all other relationships.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In this definition, which could reasonably be described as
a formulation by homosexual activists, marriage is no longer the
foundation for families but secondary to &quot;strong social and
emotional bonds.&quot;  This definition is so vague that multiple-partner
unions are not excluded, nor any imaginable combination of persons,
including a fishing boat crew.  The whole point is to demote marriage
to a level with all other relationships.

<p>

To place same-sex relationships on a par with marriage destroys
the definition of marriage altogether.  When the meaning of a
word becomes nonspecific, the exclusivity that it previously defined
is lost.  For instance, if the state of Hawaii decided to extend
the famous -- and exclusive -- &quot;Maui onion&quot; appellation
to all onions grown in Hawaii -- even on, say, Oahu --, the term
&quot;Maui onion&quot; would lose its original meaning.  Consumers
would lack confidence in buying a bag of &quot;Maui onions&quot;
if all onions could be labeled as such.  The same goes for any
brand name. Wine from California could be falsely labeled as wine
from Bordeaux, France, thus destroying the uniqueness of both
appellations.  If &quot;marriage&quot; in Hawaii ceases to be
the term used solely for the social, legal, economic and spiritual
bonding of a man and a woman, the term &quot;marriage&quot; becomes
useless.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A key point to remember is that no one of marriageable age
is prevented from marrying in Hawaii provided they don't marry
blood relatives, underage persons, nonhumans or more than one
person.  Homosexuals are not denied the right to marry; but they
have to fulfill the requirements like anyone else.  They cannot
call a same-sex relationship &quot;marriage,&quot; since it lacks
a basic ingredient -- an entire sex.  The joining of the two opposite
sexes in permanence is the very essence of marriage.  Once the
&quot;one man, one woman&quot; definition is abandoned, there
is no logical reason for limiting &quot;marriage&quot; to two
people or even to people.  Why not have three partners?  Or why
not a man and his daughter?  Or a man and his dog?  The logical
reason to extend &quot;marriage&quot; to homosexual couples has
nothing to do with marital integrity, but only reflects the fact
that homosexuals want the same status regardless of its real meaning.
Anything less, they say, is a denial of human rights.  If so,
then a threesome or a foursome seeking marital status can similarly
claim that their sexual proclivities must be recognized by society
and the law as the equal of marriage or they are facing discrimination.

<p>

<center><h3>The Real Agenda</h3></center>

<p>

Homosexual activist Tom Stoddard acknowledges that &quot;enlarging
the concept to embrace same-sex couples would necessarily transform
it into something new....Extending the right to marry to gay people
-- that is, abolishing the traditional gender requirements of
marriage -- can be one of the means, perhaps the principal one,
through which the institution divests itself of the sexist trappings
of the past.&quot;[21] In other words, while many homosexual spokesmen
say they want only to be left alone to enjoy the benefits of marriage,
Stoddard rightly sees the expanded definition as a way of attacking
the institution itself.

<p>

In 1992, organizers of the homosexuals' 1993 March on Washington
met in Texas to draft a platform of demands.  Known as &quot;the
Texas platform,&quot; it was later toned down to make it more
palatable to a mass audience.  The original section on &quot;family,&quot;
however, is revealing as to the intentions of the movement.  In
addition to Demand No. 40, &quot;the recognition and legal protection
of all forms of family structures,&quot; the writers make Demand
No. 45, &quot;legalization of same-sex marriages,&quot; and Demand
No. 46, &quot;legalization of multiple partner unions.&quot;[22]

An English study also published<br>
in the journal</i> AIDS <i>found that<br>
most 'unsafe' sex acts occur in<br>
steady relationships.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

An enormous body of research indicates that monogamy is not the
norm for the average homosexual.[23] But even when it is, the result
is not necessarily healthier behavior.  A study published in the
journal <I>AIDS</I> found that men in steady relationships practiced
more anal intercourse and oral-anal intercourse than those without
a steady partner.[24] In other words, the exclusivity of the relationship
did not diminish the incidence of unhealthy behavior that is the
essence of homosexual sexual activity.  Curbing promiscuity would
help curb the spread of AIDS and the many other sexually transmitted
diseases that are found disproportionately among homosexuals,
but there is little evidence that &quot;monogamous&quot; homosexual
relationships function that way.  An English study also published
in the journal <I>AIDS</I> found that most &quot;unsafe&quot;
sex acts occur in steady relationships.[25]

<p>

Former homosexual William Aaron explains why &quot;monogamy&quot;
has a different meaning among homosexuals:  &quot;In the gay life,
fidelity is almost impossible.  Since part of the compulsion of
homosexuality seems to be a need on the part of the homophile
to 'absorb' masculinity from his sexual partners, he must be constantly
on the lookout for [new partners].  Consequently the most successful
homophile 'marriages' are those where there is an arrangement
between the two to have affairs on the side while maintaining
the semblance of permanence in their living arrangement.&quot;[26]

<p>

<center><h3>Sexual Revolution: A War on Families</h3></center>

<p>

As the research of the late Harvard sociologist Pitirim Sorokin
reveals, no society has loosened sexual morality outside of marriage
and survived.  Analyzing studies of cultures spanning several
thousand years on several continents, Sorokin found that virtually
all political revolutions that brought about societal collapse
were preceded by sexual revolutions in which marriage and family
were no longer accorded premiere status.[27] To put it another way,
as marriage and family ties disintegrated, the social restraints
learned in families also disintegrated. Societal chaos ushers
in tyrants who promise to restore order by any means.

<p>

Self-governing people require a robust culture founded on
marriage and family, which nurture the qualities that permit self-rule:
deferred gratification, self-sacrifice, respect for kinship and
law, and property rights.  These qualities are founded upon sexual
restraint, which permits people to pursue long-term interests,
such as procreating and raising the next generation, and securing
benefits for one's children.

<p>

In the 1981 Apostolic Exhortation <I>Familiaris Consortio</I>,
John Paul II summarized the importance of marriage-based families
this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The family has vital and organic links with society since
it is its foundation and nourishes it continually through its
role of service to life:  It is from the family that citizens
come to birth and it is within the family that they find the first
school of the social virtues that are the animating principle
of the existence and development of society itself.&quot;</i>[28]

</blockquote><p>

According sex outside marriage the same protections and status
as the marital bond would destroy traditional sexual morality,
not expand it.  One can no more &quot;expand&quot; a definition
or moral principle than one can continually expand a yardstick
and still use it as a reliable measure.[29]

<p>

Marriage-based kinship is essential to stability and continuity.
A man is more apt to sacrifice himself to help a son-in-law than
some unrelated man (or woman) living with his daughter. Kinship
entails mutual obligations and a commitment to the future of the
community. Homosexual relationships are a negation of the ties
that bind -- the continuation of kinship through procreation of
children.  To accord same-sex relationships the same status as
a marriage is to accord them a value that they cannot possibly
have.  Marriages benefit more than the two people involved, or
even the children that are created.  Their influence reaches children
living nearby, as young minds seek out role models. The stability
they bring to a community benefits all.

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

Some people in Hawaii are beginning the process of fashioning
a constitutional amendment to protect their state's law on marriage,
should the courts radically redefine it.  Other states are taking
action to defend their laws regarding marriage.   If more states
strengthen their laws, they would also strengthen the marriage
defenders in Hawaii, who can cite the &quot;compelling state interest&quot;
of heading off a constitutional crisis. At the federal level,
Congress may well consider legislation mandating the one-man,
one-woman definition of marriage for all federal purposes, including
the military, federal benefits, federal agency employment policies,
and the law in federal territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) have applied to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), the multilateral organization that sets the rules for international trade. Taiwan has made substantial progress in its accession negotiations. Although several important economic issues remain, the most significant obstacle to Taiwan's membership in the WTO is not economic, but political. China insists that Taiwan should not join the WTO before China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. prefers that China and Taiwan become members of the WTO simultaneously. Simultaneous accession is, of course, the best possible outcome, but China is not as far along as Taiwan in meeting the criteria for membership. The U.S. should not let China's political sensitivities over Taiwan's membership slow U.S. negotiations with Taiwan. Once Taiwan meets the requisite economic criteria for WTO accession, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise international leadership to support Taiwan's membership, even in the face of China's determined opposition. Indeed, a clear signal to Taipei that the U.S. is willing to exercise such leadership could encourage Taiwan to meet the economic criteria for membership. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. also needs to clarify its position toward the PRC's prospective membership in the WTO. China wants to join for economic and political reasons. It wants not only the benefits of trade, but also the political recognition of its status as a world economic power and its primacy over Taiwan. In contrast, the European Union (EU), Japan, and the United States insist that WTO membership is a commercial contract, not an act of political recognition.<sup>1</sup>  Along with the Europeans and the Japanese, the Clinton Administration correctly insists that China can join the WTO only on "commercially viable terms."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Substantial disagreements remain over the terms of China's accession. In particular, China disagrees with the EU, Japan, and the U.S. on the size and scope of tariff reductions; when China's export-import licensing scheme, known as trading rights, should be abolished; how China's investment and industrial policies should be brought in line with international agreements; whether China should accede to the WTO as a developed or developing country; and what safeguards should be available to limit import surges while the WTO accession agreement is being implemented.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China's desire to join the WTO is an opportunity for the U.S. In addition to ensuring that China meets certain economic standards before acceding to the WTO, the U.S. could offer Beijing permanent, unconditional most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status in exchange not only for economic concessions, but also for dropping its political demands on Taiwan with regard to the WTO. It is in America's interest that membership in the WTO, both for China and for Taiwan, be treated as an economic question.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To further American economic interests, President Bill Clinton should:
<p><ul>
<li> Support Taiwan's accession to the WTO after it meets U.S. demands on outstanding issues. Taiwan's accession should not be held hostage to demands by the PRC.
<p>
<li> Work closely with the European Union and Japan to ensure that China becomes a WTO member on commercially viable terms. In the face of a unified position on the part of the world's major trading nations, Beijing will be more likely to make economic concessions.
<p>
<li> Offer to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in exchange for concessions. The President should ask Congress for discretionary authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Allowing the President to trade unconditional, permanent MFN status, which Beijing would value highly, for concessions on Taiwan's membership in the WTO and on economic issues benefitting the U.S.would increase America's negotiating leverage with China.

</ul><p>
<b>FROM GATT TO THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both China and Taiwan want to join the World Trade Organization because membership facilitates trade and enhances economic growth. Superseding the General Agreement Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the WTO establishes the legal framework for international trade. It also is the international organization which administers such multilateral agreements as GATT, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The WTO requires that member states and territories adhere to certain trade rules. Each member must apply the same tariffs and trade regulations to goods and services from all other members. This is known as the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, members may not discriminate against imported goods in favor of "like" domestically made products. This is known as the national treatment principle. All WTO-related trade agreements are based on these two fundamental principles.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The World Trade Organization is a direct descendent of the International Trade Organization (ITO), which allied leaders attempted to create at the end of World War II. The ITO was intended to prevent a recurrence of protectionism and to set the rules for international trade in the post-war era. In 1946-1947, President Harry Truman negotiated an "interim" agreement, the GATT, with other countries to reduce tariffs and establish a legal framework for international trade.<sup>3</sup>  The GATT was not intended to be a permanent organization, but a temporary instrument of the ITO. However, because the U.S. Senate failed to ratify the ITO charter, the ITO died stillborn in 1950, leaving the GATT forced to function as the world's multilateral trade organization until the WTO was established on January 1, 1995.<sup>4</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Since 1947, there have been eight successful rounds of trade liberalization negotiations under the GATT. The eighth was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in September 1986 and concluded in Marrakesh, Morocco, on April 15, 1994. U.S. legislation implementing the Uruguay Round was signed into law on December 8, 1994.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As in previous rounds, the Uruguay Round achieved substantial tariff reductions in developed countries. It cut tariffs by 38 percent, dropped the average tariff to 3.9 percent, and eliminated some tariffs altogether.<sup>5</sup>  The Uruguay Round also broke new ground in a number of areas:
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Agriculture.</b> For the first time, trade in agricultural products was placed under the GATT. The Uruguay Round mandates the conversion of non-tariff barriers on agricultural products into tariffs. This means that import quotas on foodstuffs must be lifted and replaced by tariffs whose rates are set to allow at least the same volume of imports as under the quota. The Uruguay Round also reduces government financial support for agriculture by 20 percent and cuts the value of export subsidies by 36 percent and the volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent over six years.<sup>6</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Apparel and Textiles.</b> Import quotas on apparel and textiles manufactured in developing economies such as China or India are being phased out over 10 years.<sup>7</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Services.</b> Trade in such services as advertising and tourism is governed by a new General Agreement on Trade in Services, which establishes an MFN principle for all services. However, this agreement applies the national treatment principle only to those services listed by a WTO member in its trade liberalization commitments.  This agreement also mandates additional negotiations on opening markets in such service sectors as financial services, telecommunications, and maritime transport.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Trade-Related Investment Measures.</b> Modest progress was made toward liberalizing foreign investment. Regulations which require that a minimum percentage of a product's "added value" (i.e., that portion of its value normally subject to a value-added tax) be produced within a country are banned. Such regulations are known as local content requirements. Also banned are regulations which require that a minimum percentage of finished goods be exported in exchange for allowing imports.<sup>8</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Intellectual Property Rights. </b>Finally, the Uruguay Round establishes global rules for the protection of copyrights, trademarks, industrial designs, trade secrets, semiconductor layouts, and geographical indications.<sup>9</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During the Uruguay Round, GATT members recognized the need for a permanent multilateral organization similar to the stillborn ITO to supervise global trade. As a result, the World Trade Organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, was established to supersede the GATT. The WTO oversees the implementation of trade agreements negotiated under auspices of the GATT or WTO, periodically evaluates the trade practices of its members, organizes future multilateral trade negotiations, and adjudicates trade disputes arising from WTO-related trade agreements.
<p>
<b>HOW TO JOIN THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A knowledge of the WTO's structure and procedure helps explain the difficulties facing Taiwan. The WTO is governed by a Ministerial Conference, which is composed of the trade ministers of all WTO members and must meet at least once every two years. Between meetings, the Ministerial Conference delegates the power to run the WTO to a General Council composed of representatives of all WTO members and a Director-General appointed by the Ministerial Conference.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Article IX of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization states, "The WTO shall continue the practice of decision-making by consensus followed under GATT.... [W]here a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the matter shall be decided by voting."  The preference for consensus is very strong. Fewer than a handful of votes have been taken in almost 50 years. When a vote does occur, each WTO member has one vote.<sup>10</sup>  Accession of new members requires a two-thirds vote of the membership. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Article XII of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization provides that a member may be either "a [sovereign] state or a separate customs territory possessing full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial relations."  A state or territory applying for membership must submit a memorandum detailing all of its laws, regulations, and policies affecting trade and investment. Once this memorandum is submitted, negotiations for entry start on two tracks. In Geneva, the General Council appoints a Working Party composed of trade negotiators from WTO members, including the U.S., to bargain with the applicant on bringing its domestic laws into line with WTO rules. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Simultaneously, the applicant begins bilateral discussions with individual WTO members on tariff reductions and other market-opening issues. Only after the applicant concludes all bilateral negotiations may the Working Party submit a Protocol of Accession to the Ministerial Conference for approval. The Protocol of Accession is a statement which details all of an applicant's trade liberalization commitments. Consequently, the bilateral negotiations are a choke point in the membership process; any member can veto an applicant simply by failing to conclude the bilateral talks.
<p>
<b>TAIWAN'S BID TO JOIN THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because GATT and its successor, the WTO, allow either sovereign states or autonomous customs territories to apply, Taiwan applied on January 1, 1990, to become a contracting party to the GATT as "The Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu," or "Chinese Taipei."  This lengthy designation was chosen to soothe Beijing's sensitivities about Taiwan, over which it claims sovereignty.<sup>11</sup>  Taiwan was following the example of Hong Kong, which became a contracting party on April 23, 1986. On September 29, 1992, the GATT accepted Taiwan's application and appointed a Working Party to begin membership negotiations.<sup>12</sup>  Since then, Taiwan has participated in eight Working Party sessions and has conducted bilateral negotiations over tariff reductions and market access with 25 WTO members.<sup>13</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China does not object to "Chinese Taipei's" accession to the WTO, provided it does not join before China. In fact, China has offered to sponsor Taiwan's membership as its first act as a WTO member; at the same time, however, because China considers accession to be a political act, it has warned WTO members that it will firmly oppose admitting Taiwan first. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both bilateral and Working Party negotiations with Taiwan have progressed farther than they have with the PRC. Taiwan has agreed to enter the WTO as a developed economy, meaning it would comply with the same standards as the European Union, Japan, and the U.S.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Taiwan has promised to implement all WTO commitments immediately and fully with only a few exceptions, related principally to agricultural products. Taiwan has offered not only to lift all import bans, but also to cut average industrial tariffs from 5.2 percent to 3.8 percent and average agricultural tariffs from 13.3 percent to 11.4 percent. It also has agreed not to raise tariff rates in the future without compensating other WTO members; such compensation may include lowering other tariff rates, removing non-tariff barriers, or liberalizing trade in service sectors.<sup>14</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, five important economic issues remain unresolved in the bilateral negotiations with Taiwan.
<p><ul>
<li> Market Access for Alcohol and Tobacco. The Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau currently maintains a legal monopoly on the manufacture and distribution of alcoholic beverages and tobacco in Taiwan. The European Union and the U.S. are seeking to end the monopoly's discriminatory practices and expand export opportunities.
<P>
<li> Market Access for Agricultural Products. Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, and the U.S. are not satisfied with Taiwan's offer to reduce tariffs and liberalize quotas for agricultural products, especially beef, milk, rice, and various fruits and vegetables.
<p>
<li> Market Access for Motor Vehicles. Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. have yet to reach agreement with Taiwan on cutting tariffs and removing strict quotas on automobile imports.
<p>
<li> Intellectual Property Rights Protection. The European Union and the U.S. find that Taiwan does not sufficiently protect intellectual property rights. Taiwan still requests a two-year phase-in period for implementing the Uruguay Round Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights, while American and European negotiators insist on full implementation immediately upon accession. Taiwan also has failed to meet the American and European demand for full protection of copyrighted materials produced in the last 50 years.
<p>
<li> Market Access for Services. Taiwan's proposal on such services as telecommunications and legal services is also inadequate for the U.S. For example, American negotiators want to remove Taiwan's suffocating restrictions on foreign investment in the telecommunications industry.<sup>15</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During the December 1995 meeting of the Taiwan Working Party, U.S. negotiators handed their Taiwanese counterparts a discussion paper on these unresolved issues. Taiwan is expected to reply before the Working Party's next meeting, tentatively scheduled for late spring 1996.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The optimum outcome would be the simultaneous accession of China and Taiwan to the WTO. However, the slower pace of the negotiations with China may be affecting the pace of talks with Taiwan. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord told a November 9, 1995, briefing at the Foreign Press Center that "we have not reached a point where we have to worry about sequence,"<sup>16</sup> but a more accurate (and perhaps more candid) statement of where things actually stand came from another American official. This official, who requested anonymity, commented after Taiwan's Working Party meeting on December 14, 1995, that "no one in the Working Party has the stomach" to propose delinking the accessions of the PRC and ROC.<sup>17</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

When the question of who should go first does come up, the Clinton Administration merely follows the crowd. As Lord noted, "[the sequence of accession] will be a collective decision of the WTO, not just the United States."  Lord went on to say that "we believe each case should be decided on its own merits" without "any political consideration."<sup>18</sup>  As a European official observed anonymously after the conclusion of the Working Group meeting on December 14, however, "Bilateral concerns with Taiwan should be easy to conclude, [but] the EU is not keen to conclude them because there is a clear sentiment among WTO members that Taiwan's accession cannot take place before China's."<sup>19</sup>  Thus, without determined American leadership, it is doubtful that Taiwan will be permitted to enter the WTO before the PRC. The WTO's consensus-based approach to decision-making gives China a tacit veto over Taiwan's accession.
<p>
<b>THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It will be more difficult for China to join the WTO than it is for Taiwan, if only because Beijing will have to make more fundamental changes in the structure of its economy.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China is now the world's third-largest economy behind the U.S. and Japan. Since 1978, the People's Republic of China has transformed its once-stagnant command economy into a growing mixed economy. Markets have been liberalized, and prices are set largely by the market. While currency inconvertibility and poor statistical data make a precise determination of China's gross domestic product impossible, estimates of its 1994 GDP range from $474 billion to $3.0 trillion.<sup>20</sup>  China's annual real GDP growth rate has averaged more than 9 percent in the last decade.<sup>21</sup>  Furthermore, China's high savings rate, high degree of literacy, and low population growth rate suggest the ability to sustain high productivity and per capita income growth rates in the future.<sup>22</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Economic reform also has stimulated international trade. China's global two-way trade was $20.7 billion in 1978, making the PRC the world's 27th-largest trading economy. In 1994, with two-way trade of $236.4 billion, China became the world's tenth-largest trading economy. Two-way trade between China and the U.S. also has grown, rising from $4.8 billion in 1980 to $48.1 billion in 1994, making the PRC America's sixth-largest trading partner.<sup>23</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Coming to Geneva.</b> China has been seeking to join the GATT and now the WTO for almost a decade. Although the Republic of China was an original contracting party to the GATT in 1948, Taiwan's government withdrew in 1950, following the Communist victory on the mainland and the Nationalist retreat to Taiwan; later, once economic reforms were underway on the mainland, the PRC sought to resume the seat itself. China won observer status in the GATT in November 1982 and formally requested accession to the GATT on July 11, 1986. On February 13, 1987, China submitted the required memorandum describing its trading system, and on March 4, 1987, the GATT Council established a Working Party to negotiate China's accession.<sup>24</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, China launched a major campaign to join the GATT before the end of 1994. Beijing wanted to become a founding member of the WTO because it saw this as political recognition of China's status as a world economic power. The European Union, Japan, and the U.S. insisted that China's accession must be accomplished on "commercially viable terms."  Because negotiators were unable to bridge the wide gap between these two positions, the talks failed to produce an agreement on China's accession.<sup>25</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Almost one year later, on November 10, 1995, Deputy United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky laid out a secret 13-page "road map" on Chinese accession to Beijing negotiators. This document outlined the full range of WTO commitments and identified the basic issues that China must resolve before it can enter the WTO on a commercially viable basis.<sup>26</sup>  These issues include:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Reducing tariffs and opening markets.</b> A wide gap remains between China's current offers on reducing tariffs and the minimum demands of the major trading powers. During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, on November 19, 1995, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced that China would cut its average tariff rate from 36 percent to 24 percent as a "downpayment" on APEC trade liberalization.<sup>27</sup>  China also has indicated a willingness to cut its average tariff rate to 17 percent within three years for industrial products and six years for agricultural products.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
China has not released detailed information on what the new tariffs would be. Therefore, it is difficult to know the exact value of this offer. However, China's average tariff rate, even after this second reduction, would remain high compared to other developing countries such as Brazil (14.3 percent) or Malaysia (9 percent). Moreover, China indicated not only a desire to maintain an industrial policy to protect "infant" industries, but also an unwillingness to liberalize foreign investment rules and import restrictions in the automotive and telecommunications sectors of its economy.<sup>29</sup> 
<P>
<li><b> Trading Rights.</b> China controls imports and exports through a licensing system known as trading rights, which requires companies to receive Beijing's approval for each of their imports or exports. Under the WTO, firms may import or export any product they wish unless that product falls under certain narrowly defined government exceptions. Eliminating trading rights is important because they allow China to negate the value of any tariff concession by refusing to grant import licenses.<sup>30</sup>  In December 1995, China offered to phase out trading rights within five years instead of the eight years it had offered in July 1995.<sup>31</sup>  The U.S. has pushed for a shorter phase-out, possibly two or three years, provided China does not favor domestic firms over their foreign rivals in granting trading rights during the phase-out period.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Investment and Industrial Policies.</b> China's investment and industrial policies violate GATT's national treatment principle. For example, China forbids foreign investment in some industries (such as motor vehicle assembly), requires local partners in others, and discriminates against foreign firms in granting trading rights. China also violates the Uruguay Round Agreement on Investment by requiring that foreign investors in China use domestic components in manufacturing of their products and also by requiring that foreign-owned firms export a large percentage of the products made at their Chinese factories. Finally, China violates the Uruguay Round Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights by requiring the transfer of patented technology as a precondition for approving foreign investment. The European Union, Japan, and the U.S. insist that China terminate these practices upon accession, but the Chinese want a much longer phase-out period.
<p>
<li><b> Developed versus Developing Country.</b> China seeks to enter the WTO as a so-called developing country. The WTO tries to help developing members adjust to global competition by allowing them to adhere to less demanding standards and to take a longer time to implement trade liberalization than is required of developed members. For example, in agriculture, while developed members must cut the value of their export subsidies by 36 percent and the volume of their subsidized exports by 21 percent over six years, developing members are allowed to reduce the value of their export subsidies by only 24 percent and the volume of their subsidized exports by 14 percent over ten years. Similarly, developed members must implement the Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights within one year, while developing members may take up to four years to implement the provisions.
<P>
China argues that it qualifies for admission as a developing country because of its low per capita income. The U.S. and other developed countries counter that China's economy is not small and weak like those of other developing countries; China is already a major exporter. Therefore, the PRC should enter the WTO under the more demanding standards of a developed country.
<P>
<li><b> Protection Against Import Surges from China.</b> The only significant disagreement among the European Union, Japan, and the U.S. concerning China's entry to the WTO is over safeguards against import surges from China during the phase-in period. WTO members may raise tariffs temporarily or impose quotas for up to four years (1) when an import surge threatens a domestic industry and (2) when relief from the import surge may "prevent or remedy serious injury and facilitate adjustment."  This practice is known as a "safeguard."  Generally, safeguards may not be targeted at a specific country; they must be applied equally to all exporting countries.
<P>
Europeans insist that during China's transition period, WTO members must be permitted to impose "safeguard" tariffs or quotas on Chinese exports without having to apply them at the same time to exports from all other WTO members. Furthermore, they want to be able to apply these safeguards against either specific Chinese products or all Chinese exports. The Japanese, on the other hand, have shown little interest in safeguards.
<P>
The American position is more ambivalent. The United States wants a strong accession agreement and would like to have China move rapidly to liberalize its market and adopt strict rules on investment and intellectual property rights. At the same time, the U.S. "road map" suggests a willingness to consider safeguards if necessary.
<P>
China objects to safeguards as a violation of the MFN principle but does not rule them out entirely. It would allow WTO members to invoke safeguards only when the volume of imports of a specific Chinese product grew substantially faster than the volume of imports of similar products from other countries.<sup>33</sup> 
<p>
<li><b> Import Quotas.</b> Referring to Poland's accession to the GATT in 1968 as a precedent, the U.S. "road map" suggests that China should consider adopting import quotas while implementing its WTO commitments.<sup>34</sup>  During Poland's accession negotiations, GATT members struggled over how to create trading opportunities between Poland's non-market economy and their market economies. To solve this problem, Poland agreed to increase its imports from GATT members by seven percent each year and to subject its exports to GATT members to special safeguards. These import quotas encouraged Polish central planners to permit more imports and to abandon some protectionist policies.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
China feels that import quotas are inappropriate during the implementation period. A Chinese negotiator recently stated that "China is in transit from a planned economy to a market economy. Today's China is totally different than Poland thirty years ago."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Jackson-Vanik.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act complicates the U.S. discussions with China over WTO accession. Passed in 1975, this law requires the President to certify annually that countries with non-market economies are allowing free emigration. Congress may overturn the President's certification by passing a joint resolution. Jackson-Vanik was intended to increase the flow of Jewish emigrants from the former Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites to Israel and the U.S. However, following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, Congress began to apply it to China by attempting to revoke China's MFN status.
<P>
The WTO requires that the U.S. grant China unconditional, permanent MFN trade status once it joins the WTO. By preventing this, Jackson-Vanik will force the U.S. to conduct separate negotiations with China to try to duplicate the terms of its WTO accession in a separate bilateral trade agreement. This reduces America's negotiating leverage, allowing China to offer less generous economic concessions to the U.S. in a parallel bilateral trade agreement than other countries would receive under the usual WTO accession agreement.<sup>37</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Chinese Reactions to the U.S. Position.</b> Chinese negotiators greeted the U.S. "road map" as a "positive initiative," but they also warned that substantial differences remain unresolved. An informal meeting of the Working Party convened in Geneva on December 7-8, 1995, and China-U.S. bilateral talks were held the following day. Chinese negotiators agreed to reply to the "road map" by the next meeting of the Working Party on March 18, 1996.<sup>38</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During a February 12, 1996, meeting with Deputy USTR Charlene Barshefsky, Vice Minister Sun Zhenyun delivered China's reaction. Sun reaffirmed that the "road map" was a positive step, but criticized parts of it for making what he claimed were demands that exceed what is required of other WTO members. Sun rejected a U.S. proposal for safeguards against surges of Chinese imports. He also opposed a U.S. suggestion for import targets. China is expected to respond to the other issues raised in the "road map" at the next Working Group meeting.<sup>39</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

So far, American, European, and Japanese negotiators have remained remarkably united in their talks with China. The three major trading powers have insisted that China may not join the WTO as a matter of political recognition; accession must occur on a "commercially viable basis."

<p>
<b>BRINGING CHINA AND TAIWAN INTO THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It will take China longer to join the WTO than it will Taiwan. The PRC has to make fundamental structural changes in its economy to meet WTO standards. The economic concessions Taiwan must make, while significant, are more limited, affecting only certain sectors of its economy. Nevertheless, even if the Taiwanese government decides to make concessions, Beijing's determined opposition to Taiwan's accession before China's and the apparent U.S. willingness to accede to Beijing's desires will hold Taiwan's application hostage to China's wishes.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

WTO-related trade agreements are commercial contracts, and WTO accession is an economic, not a political, act. Any state or territory willing and able to meet the WTO's economic criteria should be free to join. As the world's largest exporter, the U.S. has an interest in seeing that arbitrary political criteria are not applied to WTO applicants. Therefore, to further American economic interests, President Clinton should:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Support the accession of Taiwan to the WTO after Taiwan meets U.S. demands on outstanding issues.</b> If China is making enough progress in the WTO negotiations, the Clinton Administration should help China and Taiwan join at the same time. This would be the best outcome for all parties. However, if the talks with China fail and accession appears unlikely in the near future, the Clinton Administration should support the accession of Taiwan on its own merits, even though this would face China's determined opposition. 
<p>
<li><b> Cooperate with the European Union and Japan to ensure that China becomes a WTO member on commercially viable terms.</b> Close cooperation among the European Union, Japan, and the United States will prevent China from playing one against the others in the accession negotiations. Therefore, cooperation will increase American leverage in negotiating with China. At a minimum, President Clinton must insist that China agree to: 
<p><ol>
<li><b> Implement</b> the principal WTO commitments, publish all trade regulations, and provide an open and fair legal process for adjudicating trade disputes immediately upon accession.
<p>
<li><b> Accept</b> strong safeguard provisions in exchange for a longer time to phase out trading rights and implement other WTO commitments.
<p>
<li><b> End</b> the PRC's practice of forcing foreign firms to transfer technology as a condition of doing business in China. China's market is so huge that Beijing has the leverage to force large industrial firms to surrender to this form of government-sponsored theft.
<p>
<li><b> Enforce</b> fully all existing bilateral trade agreements, especially the 1995 Intellectual Property Rights Memorandum of Understanding.
</ol><P>
<li><b> Offer to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in exchange for concessions.</b> The President should ask Congress for discretionary authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Beijing highly values gaining unconditional, permanent MFN trade status in the U.S. However, keeping China on conditional MFN status subject to annual renewal, as mandated by Jackson-Vanik, provides the U.S. with few benefits. By granting the President the discretionary authority to exempt China from Jackson-Vanik, Congress would strengthen substantially America's leverage in WTO accession talks with Beijing. The President then could offer Beijing unconditional, permanent MFN trade status in exchange not only for relaxing its political demands on Taiwan's membership in the WTO, but for economic concessions that benefit American exporters and investors.
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Jackson-Vanik Amendment harms American interests in a number of ways. First, applying Jackson-Vanik to China is based on a faulty premise. The PRC is no longer a stagnant non-market economy. Rather, it is a growing mixed economy. Proponents of applying Jackson-Vanik ignore the economic reforms that have occurred in China since 1978.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, applying Jackson-Vanik to China is inappropriate. Jackson-Vanik was designed to encourage the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites to lift restrictions on Jewish emigration to Israel and the U.S. However, it is American immigration law, not Chinese emigration policy, that restricts the flow of Chinese emigrants. While millions of Chinese would willingly emigrate to the U.S., American immigration law limits the flow to approximately 25,000 annually. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Third, Jackson-Vanik's threat to withdraw MFN is at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive. MFN tariffs are not a special privilege granted to specific countries; they are the standard rates that the U.S. extends to all but a handful of small countries. Withdrawing MFN would compel the U.S. to apply Smoot-Hawley tariffs on Chinese exports. After the inevitable Chinese retaliation against American exports, there would be a virtual cessation of China-U.S. trade.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Finally, Jackson-Vanik weakens the U.S. bargaining position in the WTO accession talks with China. By preventing the U.S. from granting China unconditional, permanent MFN, it would force the U.S. to conclude a separate bilateral trade pact with Beijing, paralleling China's WTO accession agreement and allowing the PRC to offer the U.S. smaller tariff cuts and fewer market-opening measures than it would grant to other WTO members in its accession agreement.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China are seeking to join the WTO, the former as a sovereign state and the latter as an autonomous customs territory. Although Taiwan is closer to the goal, both have yet to meet the economic criteria for membership. Taiwan sees WTO membership as a commercial contract, while the PRC regards it as an act of political recognition. Beijing therefore opposes Taiwan's accession before its own. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because China's accession is more complicated, negotiations with China may take longer to complete than those with Taiwan. Taiwan's accession to the WTO could be held hostage to the process of internal change in China. Given the commercial nature of the WTO, this would be manifestly unfair. When Taiwan meets the economic criteria, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for its accession, even in the face of China's determined opposition. Taiwan should join the WTO when it is ready, not when Beijing says it can.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<p><ol>
<li>Technically, only sovereign states and autonomous customs territories may join the WTO. However, in the Treaty of Rome, member states ceded their authority over international commercial relations to the European Union. The EU represents all of its member states at the WTO and acts on their behalf in trade negotiations. For the sake of simplicity, this <I>Backgrounder</I> will treat the EU as if it were a WTO member.<p>
<li>There are several important exceptions to the most-favored-nation principle. Customs unions such as the European Union and free-trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are permissible exceptions to the MFN principle. Likewise, developed WTO members may abolish or reduce tariffs on certain industrial goods imported from least developed members. This is known as the generalized system of preferences (GSP). <p>
<li>The GATT was negotiated under authority granted to the President in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 and thus did not require congressional approval.<P>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
        Immigration Reform          </h2>            
       

                                 <BR>


        Wednesday, March 20, 1996:

        <P></center>


        

        On behalf of the more than one million members
and supporters of the American

        Conservative Union, I'm writing to share
our concerns regarding the controversial issue of

        worker verification hotlines as contained
in HR 2202, the immigration reform bill you will

        be considering today and tomorrow.  We oppose
such hotlines, and urge you to oppose them

        as well.  Specifically, I urge you to oppose
the Gallegly amendment, and to support the

        Chabot amendment instead.

   <P>     

        The original version of the bill contained
language mandating a national employment

        verification pilot program, through the institution
of an 800-number hotline attached to a

        database.  Critics rightfully referred to
this as a &quot;1-800-BIG BROTHER&quot; number.

<P>        

        The worker verification provisions in the
original bill have been diluted somewhat.  Instead

        of a mandatory national program, the underlying
legislation now calls for a &quot;voluntary&quot;

        program in which employers could call a national
database to verify whether or not

        prospective workers were eligible for employment.

<P>        

        But what is the point of establishing a pilot
program, on either a mandatory or voluntary

        basis, if not to test its efficacy?  If it
fails, it will have been merely a waste of time and

        money.  But if it succeeds, the likelihood
is great that a move would be made in a future

        Congress to mandate the program nationally
-- something we oppose outright.

<P>        

        To begin, we have a strong philosophical
objection to the entire concept that individuals and

        private employees must phone the Federal
Government to ask permission to work. 

        Moreover, we have serious concerns about
where this might lead.  Once a national

        employee verification hotline is established,
we're only one short step away from national

        identification cards, to &quot;ease&quot;
the burden on the hotline and further combat fraud.  (In fact,

        we've noted with some dismay the establishment
of just such a federal identification card in

        the original version of the companion Senate
legislation, S. 269.)

<P>        

        In addition to our pure philosophical objections,
there are also practical considerations.  As

        we read the legislation, it appears to us
that the heaviest burden likely would fall on those

        businesses that seek to abide by the law;
those who knowingly and regularly flout the law

        by hiring illegal aliens would be no more
likely to abide by this law than they would be

        likely to abide by current law.  Thus, just
as in the case of the Brady Bill (which merely

        mandates that law-abiding citizens must wait
to purchase a hand gun, while criminals are

        not deterred at all from purchasing such
weapons), it is the law-abiding citizens who pay the

        price.

<P>        

        Small businesses do not have the staff or
the resources to keep up with the new mandate. 

        Many would be literally snowed under with
the new requirement.  Those who survive the

        new regulatory burden may see their colleagues'
distress and conclude that disobeying the

        law is a cost of doing business -- thereby
taking law-abiding small business owners and

        turning them into criminals.  Is that what
we want?

        <P>

        The Gallegly amendment would re-institute
the mandatory nature of the verification pilot

        program, while the Chabot amendment would
eliminate the program altogether.  For that

        reason, we urge you to oppose the Gallegly
amendment, and support instead the Chabot

        amendment.  When even a president as liberal
as Bill Clinton says &quot;The era of Big

        Government is over,&quot; how can we justify
the creation of a Big Brother employment

        verification hotline -- even on a trial basis?

<h2>Affirmative Action</h2>
</center>
<blockquote><P> 
For the past thirty years, affirmative-action policies have contributed to the 
balkanization of America by race, sex and ethnicity.   The original intent of these 
policies -- to redress past discrimination -- was a noble one, but the means of redress 
have been fundamentally flawed and the real-life consequences disastrous.  It is time 
to stop counting by race and to re-dedicate this nation to the proposition that we are 
a color-blind society.<p>    

To be sure, racism and discrimination are still ugly stains on the American 
landscape, and where they occur, we should use existing laws to stamp them out.   
But affirmative action as a remedy has outrun its course.  If we continue to count by 
race, hire by race, and admit by race, we will divide by race.  We must renew our 
commitment to the American ideal that we are one people:<i> e pluribus unum</i>.  The 
best way to achieve a color-blind society is actually to be a color-blind society, in law 
and in spirit.<p>

<B>Recent Developments</B><br>
Despite President Clinton's morally bankrupt defense of all federal affirmative-
action programs, public opposition to quotas and the institutionalized 
discrimination of affirmative action programs continues to mount.  Moreover, 
several recent developments have dealt powerful blows to federal policies and 
programs that count by race.<p>  

In June, the Supreme Court ruled in Adarand Constructors v. Pena that federal 
affirmative action programs must meet a standard of &quot;strict scrutiny.&quot;  Under the 
strict-scrutiny standard, the federal government must demonstrate that an 
affirmative-action program is narrowly tailored to redress identifiable past 
discrimination.  Few of the existing affirmative-action programs meet that test. 

In July, Congress introduced &quot;The Equality of Opportunity Act of 1995,&quot; which 
prohibits the federal government from taking race, gender, or ethnicity into account 
in its employment or contracting practices, or in the implementation of any federally 
conducted program or activity. The &quot;Equality of Opportunity Act&quot; is an important 
piece of legislation that, if passed, will guarantee all Americans justice and equal 
treatment under  the law.<p>

Empower America is also a strong supporter of the California Civil Rights 
Initiative, which should appear on the statewide ballot as a referendum in 
November of 1996.   The Civil Rights Initiative prohibits the state of California from 
using race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin as criteria for discriminating 
against, or giving preferential treatment to, any individual. <p>  

In dismantling the racially divisive programs of affirmative action, it is important 
for conservatives to be principled, not opportunistic:  We still need to reach out to 
disadvantaged Americans, especially those living in our inner-cities.  To this end,  
Empower America supports measures that will expand opportunities to the inner-
city poor, including tenant- management housing, empowerment zones, and school 
choice.  We also support redesigning the tax code to make possible broader 
ownership of capital, savings, and credit in the minority community.   Expansion of 
opportunity is necessary to ensure equality of opportunity.<p>

<h2>Outcome-Based Education</h2>
<P><i>March 19, 1996</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
				
There are serious, legitimate concerns surrounding outcome-based education (OBE).  In 
principle, it sounds good.  In practice, however, OBE can be used to undermine parental 
authority and traditional moral and religious beliefs.  This explains why much of the 
criticism of OBE has come largely from parents' rights groups.<p>

A key to understanding outcome-based education depends on making the distinction 
between cognitive outcomes (i.e., the development of intellectual abilities and skills) 
and behavioral and social outcomes (i.e., the shaping of social attitudes, values, and 
interpersonal relationships).<p>

A case can be made on behalf of outcome-based education if it is confined to cognitive 
outcomes; that is, if we objectively measure students' knowledge in the basics -- math, 
science, history, and English.  Some people still believe that OBE can be used to advance 
such ends (a good example of OBE, properly utilized, is the current high school 
Advanced Placement exam, in which students do not get credit for their course unless 
they demonstrate proficiency in a rigorous nationwide test).  This explains why 
conservative education reformers like Chester Finn, Jr. have spoken well of cognitively-
based outcomes.<p>

The real concern is when those in the education establishment use OBE to (1) eliminate 
objective measurable criteria (like standardized tests); (2) do away with the traditional 
subject-based curriculum in favor of an emphasis on things like general skills, attitudes 
and behaviors; and (3) advance their own radical social agenda.  Increasingly, OBE is 
applied to the realm of behavior and social attitudes--becoming, in effect, a Trojan Horse 
for social engineering, an elementary and secondary school version of the kind of 
&quot;politically correct&quot; thinking that has infected our colleges and universities.<p>

Outcome-based education raises a number of questions:  what if parents do not want 
their children to view all lifestyles as equal?  What if a young person has developed 
strong personal convictions based on traditional moral standards?  Will students who do 
not give  &quot;appropriate&quot; responses to desired &quot;outcomes&quot; still be allowed to graduate?  It is 
also worth noting that little in the way of public input is sought when it comes to OBE, 
and it offers no method of accountability.<p>


There are some other problems associated with OBE, including:<p>
<ul>
<li>	The &quot;dumbing down&quot; of classes.  Many of the curricula being developed call for 
teachers to wait for all students to understand all aspects of a subject before moving 
on.  Many parents fear that this will penalize more advanced students.

<li>	Traditional education terms are being reinterpreted.  In some programs, <i>cognitive</i> 
now refers to &quot;a belief system,&quot; and <i>critical thinking</i> refers to &quot;a willingness to 
question everything, including one's deepest convictions, beliefs and relationships.&quot;<p>
</ul>
Some of the confusion surrounding outcome-based education is based on semantics.  The 
conservative education reform movement of the 1980s wanted to focus on outcomes (i.e., 
knowledge gained) instead of inputs (i.e., dollars spent).  The aim was to ensure greater 
accountability.  What the education establishment has done is to appropriate the term but 
change the intent.

In short, the &quot;outcomes&quot; increasingly being measured are not based on objective and 
measurable criteria like standardized tests; the state-desired outcome is increasingly 
based on vague, subjective social aims.  Consider some of the vocabulary that surrounds 
OBE:  words like &quot;openness to change,&quot; &quot;appreciation of the global community,&quot; 
&quot;tolerance,&quot; and &quot;higher-order thinking skills.&quot;<p>

There is a big push in the country on behalf of outcome-based education.  But unless 
some means is found to ensure that it serves the traditional aims of sound intellectual and 
moral education, it should be resisted.<p>

<I>The following remarks were delivered at &quot;The New Majority:  Democratic Governance in a Revolutionary Age&quot; conference, hosted by The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation on January 22, 1996.  The conference explored the possibility of political realignment and asked:  Is there a &quot;new majority&quot; taking shape in America and other western-style democracies?  Who is part of the new majority, what are its beliefs - and how is it related to the transition from an industrial to an information-age economy?  Which (if either) American political party is best positioned to represent it?  And, what impact will it have on the 1996 presidential election?

<p>
Many people infer that the title, The New Majority, has something to do with the recent events in the United States Congress, the development of a new majority, a Republican majority, in the House and in the Senate.  While that event in November 1994 certainly is part of the phenomenon we are describing, the new majority that we are talking about here today is in fact a much larger and broader phenomenon.  One of the underlying premises of the work that we do at The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation is the notion that we are in a time of Big Change, the transition from an Industrial Age to an Information Age, and a series of very profound cultural, economic, political and social changes that accompany that.  On the political side, that clearly will involve the creation of new coalitions, not only in politics, not only in America, but around the world.  
<p>
The new majority that we are talking about here today is an Information Age majority.  It is not yet clear which political party will represent that new majority, whether it will be called Republican, Democratic or by some new name.  Indeed, the politics of 1995 as they have played out have not, in my view, and in the view of many of those you will hear today, represented the politics of the new debate.  
<p>
In many ways, the Republican agenda as it's taken shape and been explained on Capitol Hill more resembles the fiscal conservatism of Herbert Hoover than the vision of Newt Gingrich.  By the same token, the Democratic minority on Capitol Hill appears to much better represent the Welfare State, Great Society message of Lyndon Johnson than the visionary speeches of President Clinton.  
<p>
We are in a time of Big Change.  It is a time of opportunity.  It is a time of danger.  Today we discuss what that means in terms of the shape of American politics, its implications for 1996, and its implications beyond.

<p><CENTER><B>Has there Been a Political Revolution?
by Vin Weber<B><SUP>*</SUP> 
</B></B></CENTER>
<p>
All the time I encounter political associates who argue that if such and such a thing happens, the Republican revolution will be over.  If we nominate the wrong presidential candidate or if Bill Clinton gets re-elected or if we don't get the right conclusion to the budget agreement, then the revolution will be over.  
<p>
I'm here to argue that the revolution <I>is</I> over, that we want the revolution to be over, and that we ought to think of the revolution as being over.  To think of an ongoing revolution is a mistake.
<p>
Revolutions are actions that overturn an existing order. Successful revolutions end quickly and then the revolutionaries get on with the business of rebuilding society consistent with the principles that drove the revolution.  I think it is a political mistake for Republicans to continue to talk about revolution.  It may stir the faithful, but it scares the average voter.  And more importantly, I think it misinterprets and incorrectly analyzes what the state of the country politically is and where we are.  Simply put: the revolution is over, we've won, and it's time to think more seriously about rebuilding society consistent with the principles that brought the revolution to power.
<p>
The first question people might ask is have we really won?  After all, Bill Clinton is still President, much of the Contract With America, perhaps most of it, will not become law until there's a change in the presidency, and there's ample reason to believe that we haven't changed the way the country is governed. I think that's all true. Yet, we have experienced a political revolution in the form of a major intellectual and ideological realignment.
<p>
A fundamental change in the way the voters perceive government, it's usefulness, it's ability to interact successfully with them, it's relationship to individual people and communities:  it is in this sense that I would argue that we had a successful revolution and a successful realignment, and we are now going about the business of rebuilding society.  
<p>
The last genuine realignment was in the 1930's, culminating about three decades of political turmoil in the country featuring Progressives and Populists and Bull Moosers and all sorts of other insurgents within the existing two-party order.  In 1933, Eleanor Roosevelt said &quot;One has a feeling of going it blindly because we are in a tremendous stream and none of us knows where we are going to land.&quot;  At the beginning of the great revolution that became known as the New Deal, with a huge mandate from the voters and being the most ideologically oriented person in the Administration, certainly much more so than her husband the President, Eleanor Roosevelt still had this sense that she was in a dark room and didn't really know where to go.  They were making up the New Deal as they went along.  For us to look back today, 60 years later, we could fall into the trap of thinking that this was all very carefully planned from the outset, the building of what we now call the Liberal Welfare State.  
<p>
It's important for us to understand that this wasn't the case.  You found that they made up quite a bit as they went along. Mrs. Roosevelt reflected most of the thinking of the New Deal: lots of optimism and lots of ideas, but not a clear plan in any sense.  They did, however, have a model that made a lot of sense to them and surprisingly that model really came from corporate America.  Some writers have argued only half facetiously that the real father of the New Deal was not Franklin Roosevelt but Henry Ford. Alvin and Heidi Toffler have written about the impact of what Henry Ford and other captains of industry did around the turn of the century in providing a model for the New Dealers when they went into government. Business was in the process of reorganizing and regimenting America, forcing massive population movements from the country into the city, organizing business along the factory model with hierarchically structured corporate organizations. Standardization was the key word.
<p>
The New Deal planners had this model of corporate America that seemed to be the wave of the future. Top down, hierarchical command and control structures, standardization, regimentation organization: That was how successful enterprises were organized.  It followed that government should be organized in the same way. It helped a great deal that President Roosevelt had the twin disasters of the Depression and World War Two to focus the country's attention, but nonetheless part of the process had been going on for some time.  In short, it just made sense to the American people.  By the end of Roosevelt's first term, people really had a new conception of how government should interact with people, and it was consistent with the other changes that they saw taking place around them.
<p>
Their conception of the proper role of government dominated our politics until 1980. It's imperative to recognize that it was not simply one party - although the Democrats benefited proportionally from it - but both parties basically accepted the same premise about how government should approach problem solving. The notion that the country swung back to the Republicans when Eisenhower was elected really is a misreading if you think about what happened.  Eisenhower, and Nixon as well, simply validated the New Deal, liberal welfare state approach to problem solving by embracing it.  Eisenhower was quite specific in office about saying he did not want to go back and repeal the New Deal.  He wanted to invent &quot;modern Republicanism.&quot;  Nixon, when he was in office, established the EPA, OSHA and imposed price controls.  In both cases, they accepted what had become the conventionalism since the successful Roosevelt revolution, which was that Federal Government activity, centrally structured, hierarchically organized, standardized in approach, was the way in which government operated to solve problems. 
<p>
The first President really not to be a part of that consensus was Ronald Reagan.  It's not that he was successful in rolling it back, but he really did not accept those premises and did not try in any way to expand the liberal welfare state as every President, Republican and Democrat alike, had done from Roosevelt up unto Reagan.  	
<p>

Now, to restate my basic point: I believe that a similar realignment in thinking has occurred.  Just as the realignment of our country's thinking that took place in the 1930's had gestated for 30 years or so with the Progressives and the Populists, there's been a long period of gestation and rejection of New Deal, Great Society liberalism today. It began with Barry Goldwater, who challenged the Republican Party's acceptance of those principles, and culminated in Ronald Reagan, who ran a campaign basically against the Welfare State.  
<p>
What confirmed the realignement was not so much the 1994 elections, but the health care debate earlier that year.  After the Clinton health care plan was interred in September of 1994 by <I>The Washington Post</I>, <I>The New York Times</I> and others, it was interesting to watch the analysis from all of the smarter-than-thou people around Washington - people in the media, people in the think tanks, people in politics - all explaining that, of course the Clinton health care plan was doomed from the start because&#133;fill in the blank.  Either because the President put his wife in charge of it, or because Ira Magaziner had never succeeded in anything, and 15 other reasons why.  Yet the amazing thing about the failure of Clinton's health care plan was that it failed.
<p>
It was the first time that a Democrat President, carrying a substantial Congressional majority, running a campaign based on a promise of a tangible benefit to a middle class constituency, addressing a real problem, failed to deliver.  He couldn't deliver not so much because he simply couldn't control or discipline his Congress, but because public support for it collapsed.  Support for Clinton's plan went from 60 percent plus when he initiated it to about 30 percent when it died.  It went from being the issue that many Democrats thought was going to be their key issue in preventing normal mid-term election losses, to the issue that by the last two or three weeks of the campaign Republican strategists were telling their challengers to use against the Democratic incumbent as symbolizing everything that they wanted to be against.  That's a remarkable transformation.
<p>
The more people learned about Clinton's plan, the less they liked it. They didn't like it because it was bureaucratic and costly and centralized and all those things.  So what's new?  Name me a New Deal Great Society program that wasn't attacked by Republican opponents as being bureaucratic, costly and centralized.  The difference is this time it worked.
<p>
The ratification of this revolution in people's thinking is the fact that President Clinton appears to have accepted it.  He has not reinitiated a new health care proposal, nor does Clinton have any other major new Federal initiatives that he's putting before the Congress.  In his 1996 State of the Union message, the President said &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot;  He talked a good deal about foreign policy success, bragged about the health of the economy, threw up a few liberal slogans on Medicare and Medicaid, but we saw no stirring defense of the Department of Commerce, no call for establishing any new Federal agencies.
<p>
That the President is already acting substantially within the parameters of the new context of American politics validates my argument that the revolution has succeeded.  In this regard, Clinton is less today Franklin Roosevelt or his hero, John Kennedy, than he is the Eisenhower of our new realignment, the first Democratic President to essentially govern within the constraints of this newly realigned country, with in the new thinking about the appropriate role for government.
<p>
The challenge, then, is not necessarily one of &quot;keeping the revolution alive,&quot; but to move ahead as quickly and wisely as we can with the rebuilding of society in the wake of the revolution.  That's hard work because although the public has largely rejected New Deal, Great Society, welfare state liberalism or whatever words you want to add to my description of it, there really is no evidence that they want to go back to a pre-New Deal conception of government.
<p>
Yet there is a great risk for Republicans to conclude this realignment is simply a dismantlingly of government. After all, in the 1992 election not too long ago, Democrats won largely on the issue of insufficient government activism. They argued that President Bush had no agenda domestically or economically, and people wanted more activism from their government.  The third party candidate, Perot, did not talk about diminishing or shrinking government, he talked about getting under the hood and fixing government.
<p>
Some pundits think the tension between an electorate seemingly wanting an activist government in 1992 and one wanting to greatly reduce the size of government in 1994 shows and immature and spoiled public. Supposedly voters want lower taxes and less government while demanding solutions to all the social problems like health care and the environment.  Many pundits say that voters can't have it both ways and are going to have to be forced to make a choice.
<p>
I don't think that's the case.  The public is sending a strong, strong signal to politicians that they want a different way of approaching problems, and they're going to be ready to turn politicians out until they find those people or parties that will devise a new solution, a new way of activism.  I don't have all the answers.  I think the outlines are beginning to come into shape somehow, probably more if you look at governors and mayors than at the federal level. Although some people like John Ashcroft and Dan Coats in the United States Senate are already talking very seriously about how to forge a new domestic policy, bringing in non-governmental organizations, churches and others more actively into the solution of some of our social problems.  Certainly at the level of governors and mayors, you find people like Steve Goldsmith in Indianapolis experimenting with new concepts, utilizing privatization, trying to grab a hold of community and tap non-governmental sources to solve problems.
<p>
There is, just as at the beginning of the New Deal, something to be invented today. We are only beginning to see its outlines.  It'll be very clear to people when they look back on it 20 or 30 years from now, but our challenge is to make sure that we get beyond the dismantling of the state and actually think seriously about how we build a conservative opportunity society, something that replaces the liberal welfare state. The party or people that do that will be the majority for another 40 years.

<CENTER><B>Who Is the New Majority?
by Frank Luntz<B><SUP>*</SUP> </B></B></CENTER>
<p> 
It is not an election itself that causes political revolutions.  If you ask Americans today whether they believe that there's been a change since 1994, three out of four would say not.  So if there's been a revolution, you better wake up the American people.  They don't see it.  Even when the Federal government was closed, 88 percent of Americans said it did not affect them at all.
<p>
Yet there is a new majority taking shape in the electorate.  The best way to understand a majority is to understand what the average American is like. 
<p>
She - because men smoke too much, drink too much, work too hard and die too young - is Jennifer Smith.  She's 32.7 years old.  She's white. She comes from European ancestry.  She lives in a mortgaged suburban home that has three bedrooms and a pet and is heated by natural gas.  She likes living there, but she is thinking about moving to something larger.  Jennifer is a happily married mother at least for now.  The strange thing about survey research is that I know she will become unhappy in about three or four years but I don't have the heart to tell her.  She watches about four hours of TV a day between work and raising a family.  She has a high school diploma, perhaps a little bit of college but she does someday hope to get that college degree.  She works in a service job but has higher aspiration.
<p>
Like her husband, John, Jennifer has her own car, and she drives to work alone each day.  There's a direct correlation, by the way, between those that car pool and registration of Democrats and Liberals. So whenever you see a car pool lane, you know that the people driving it are most likely to be Democrats.  Now the difference between her and her husband is that when they both reach a yellow light, she will stop and he will drive right through.  She attends church once a week, although she occasionally misses a week here and there.  She prays quietly to herself almost once a day, and she strongly believes in God.  Even though she feels the American dream is somewhat alive, Jennifer thinks the nation is in serious trouble and that some country other than America will be the number one economic superpower by the year 2020.
<p>
Emotionally, Jennifer is frustrated and anxious, particularly about crime and the economy, but she is less concerned than her husband.  She believes that the federal deficit is spinning out of control, and she thinks that her elected officials waste 48 cents out of every dollar.  She votes only once every four years.  She hates partisan politics and has very little confidence in the Federal government.  She does not trust politicians, and she's skeptical of the media, of lawyers and of the legal system - although she did follow the O. J. Simpson trial virtually every day.  She doesn't know if the two party system is salvageable, nor does she really care.  However, she does believe that her local community is headed in the right direction and she is somewhat optimistic that her own personal situation will improve.  She and her husband are charitable people; they do give more than one percent of their income to charity. They want to help those that are less fortunate, but they simply don't want their tax dollars going to Welfare.  They don't want the charity to come from Washington, to come from a bureaucracy. She's a patient person, but her patience is running out.
<p>
In short, Jennifer Smith believes in our government in abstract principles - democracy and capitalism for example - but she has little confidence in institutions - the Presidency, the Congress or the courts.  She believes in herself, but she wonders whether society will bring her down.  Jennifer and her 263 million compatriots see the American dream slipping out of their grasp and even farther out of the reach of her children.  She doesn't believe the American dream is dead - in fact, only 15 percent of Americans do - but she thinks it's very sick.  
<p>
(The problem that I have in saying that the new majority has won, that the new majority exists today and that it's in the Republican Party, is that the Republican Party has not successfully appealed to Jennifer Smith.)
<p>
That's a demographic look at the average American.  Now I want to give you an attitudinal look, and I want to start with what the new majority rejects because from a public opinion standpoint it is easier to tell you what they are against than to tell you what they are for.  
<p>
They reject the Federal welfare system above all else.  When you talk to a so-called member of the new majority, if you want to see the emotion and the passion, it doesn't come from a balanced budget.  It doesn't come even from crime.  What makes them really spitting angry - where they start to use four letter words -is the welfare system, how destructive it is, how unfair it is, how vicious it is, and how they want to eliminate it. If there's one great opportunity that Republicans have in 1996, it's to tie the welfare system around President Clinton's neck and sink him with it.  It's like lead boots that the so-called wise guys used to use on informants when they would throw them off some beach down south of Miami.  The welfare system is that around President Clinton's neck.  
<p>
What next makes members of the new majority most angry is the public school system, with increasing Federal control, mediocrity and the fact that there seems to be more bureaucracy to it.  They're angry at a Federal tax code that is anti-work, anti-investments, anti-savings and, when you talk to middle class, anti-success.  They reject the expense of Federal bureaucracy.  It seems to serve its own interest, and what freaked them out is something that came out of a David Letterman routine when he made the comment: &quot;If 80 percent of our Federal workers are non-essential, doesn't that send us a message?&quot; The one thing that I don't understand is why we Republicans did not draw the line back in December and say if they're not essential, why are they here, and if they're not working, why are we paying them? How many of you, if you don't come to work because there's a furlough, if you're not producing day after day and you're out of work for two weeks, three weeks, how many of your bosses or you yourself will get paid?  What are we doing paying people not to work?  It's insanity, and a new majority does not understand that.
<p>
The new majority rejects Federal regulatory-structure red tape.  They do not understand why it takes them so long to fill out forms, why it seems like the government is against them, why a small business can be shut down by OSHA if their toilet paper is one-quarter of an inch too high or too low.  They reject the legal system that has become the most expensive in the world and the most embarrassing at home.  They reject the anti-family mind set that permeates almost all of Washington's social, tax and welfare policies. They reject a government that can't even keep them safe. They reject the Washington ethic that encourages dependency and victimization:  Everyone in America seems to be a victim; It wasn't those poor Mendez brothers fault that they went in and gunned down their parents; They actually went out and reloaded so they could shoot again;  It wasn't their fault; It was society's fault, society to blame.  And, they reject the $5 trillion federal debt that is eroding America's ability to save and invest.
<p>
If there is a new majority, than current politicians, if they wish to succeed, must find a way to communicate to these people, to address their concerns, and not to play in this rhetorical game that we've been in right now. The Republican party is losing this budget debate, and if you think otherwise, then I don't know what TV shows you're watching.  Every day, from Leon Panetta to Donna Shalala, from Robert Reich to George Stephanopolis, they talk about values in the Clinton Administration.  They talk about principles.  They talk about being pro-family, pro-community, and even the President talks about spirituality.  What do Republicans do?  They talk about numbers, and fight over the nuts and bolts.  Any party that wants to lead the new majority cannot do that.  You cannot communicate in trillions and billions when the new majority understands things in hundreds and maybe if it's a mortgage in thousands.
<p>

The central questions the new majority wants answered is:  How many of you believe that you have a better quality of life today than your parents did when they were your age?  And how many of you honestly believe that your children will have a better quality of life than you when they reach your age? 

<p>
Why do so many people answer yes to the first question but not the latter? We have to understand why so many hands went up to the first question and so few hands went up to the second question. If the Republicans are to lead that new majority, as I certainly hope they are, because I don't believe in a third party, then the Republican Party has to communicate to all of you who said yes to the first question but not to the second.

<CENTER><B>Where is American Public Opinion Headed?
by Andrew Kohut<B><SUP>*</SUP> 
</B></B></CENTER><p>

If there's a revolution going on, it's not with the American public. We just see no indication that public opinion is in a revolutionary state.  It's certainly changing.  It's more evolving than being in a state of revolution.
<p>
We've been measuring basic political values since 1987.  Each year we do a major national survey and we ask people about how they feel about the government, the national economy and a whole range of social issues.  We see two persistent trends since 1987: less support or more suspicion of political leaders and more cynicism about the way the political system works, and less support for government solutions to national problems.  Consistently, each of our seven or eight measures which attempt to find out how much support there is for government solutions has shown an erosion of support since the mid-1980's.  In 1987, perhaps the average percentage of our samples saying they supported government solutions was at the 70 percent level.  It's slowly eroded to the 60 or 55 level, but it's still there.  
<p>
There is still clear majority support for Federal government solutions to help the poor, to provide a social safety net, to improve the environment, to deal with the problems of education and to deal with a wide variety of problems.  People no longer look to government to solve new problems.  Bureaucracy is in fact a dirty word, and government is seen more than ever as a court of last resort, but it is indeed seen as a court of last resort, and the American public doesn't want to see it go away. 
<p>
Looking at the past 12 months, what we see most clearly is that the public thinks that the new Republican majority on the Hill is cutting government too fast and too far.  They want welfare reform and they want government reform.  They want government changed, but they don't want to see it go away.  Whether they're correct in their perception, they think that the Republicans are going to do away with government to too great an extent.
<p>

I think the most important thing to recognize about American public opinion besides this discontent with the way government works, but still not a total disconnection from it altogether, is that we're in a cycle.  There's always been a change in the American public opinion between wanting the government to solve problems and not liking government, and when the emphasis is on the problems, then the American public doesn't pay a lot of attention to how inefficiently the Government works, or the downside to Government activity.  
<p>
The emphasis now is not on the problems.  People aren't up in arms about the problems of the poor.  The environment is a concern, but it's not a top concern.  The issues that are paramount to people aren't the kinds of things that were the case in the late 1960's and early 1970's when government programs really grew.  Therefore, there's much greater attention to the shortcomings of government activity and the discontents that have been mentioned here.  But the public has in no way in my view walked away from government.  It still wants government to do things that can't be done by the private sector or people can't do themselves, and the American public continues to feel that if all else fails the government should help solve problems - certainly not in the free form way that the American public felt 20 years ago, but nonetheless it's there.
<p>
The most important thing about the new electorate as we have measured it is not so much the left and the right - which are more clearly etched and defined than 10 years ago - but the fact that the middle has become what we describe it in our latest topology as the detached center, because it is so disconnected in terms of ideological thinking and political thinking from the left to the right.  The detachment isn't so much from political belief as it is from political system. The typical American is a high-school educated, middle-aged woman with no connection to the Republican Party or the Democratic Party and has very contradictory views about governance and issues of strong support of the environment, suspicious about higher taxes, worries about government yet a believer in social welfare.  So when I said there's no makings of a revolution in American public opinion, the nature of that political thinking is not revolutionary in the sense except in its detachment from the two political parties.

<h3>DEFENDING AMERICA: ENDING AMERICA'S VULNERABILITY TO BALLISTIC MISSILES</h3>


An Update by the Missile Defense Study Team ("Team B")<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1074<br>
March 15, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="bg1074t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Recommended Funding for Missile Defense Systems
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1995, The Heritage Foundation convened a Missile Defense Study Team to examine the growing threat of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The Missile Defense Study Team, known as "Team B," released its report <I>Defending America: A Near- and Long-Term Plan to Deploy Missile Defenses</I>, in June 1995, recommending timely, affordable, and technically sound responses to the missile threat, in keeping with the congressional leadership's high priority on ballistic missile defense.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Subsequent events have only reinforced the importance of Team B's recommendations that an effective ballistic missile defense system be deployed at the earliest possible date. In fact, the need for a vigorous missile defense program is more acute than ever. Ballistic missiles carrying mass destructive warheads remain the only weapons that can seriously threaten the territory of the United States. Shorter range or theater ballistic missiles (TBMs) also threaten U.S. forces and bases abroad, and allies in key regions of the world, as potentially hostile states continue to develop weapons of mass destruction and seek to acquire missiles to deliver them.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In February 1991, an Iraqi Scud missile killed 29 American soldiers in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, the largest single loss of American life in the Persian Gulf War. Yet five years later, the U.S. still has no better defense against theater ballistic missiles than the <I>Patriot</I>. To be sure, the <I>Patriot</I> did good service in the Gulf War, helping to neutralize the potential impact of Iraq's Scud arsenal. But it was designed originally as an air defense, not an anti-missile system, and its ability to defend a wide area or population center from ballistic missile attack was deliberately limited.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. still has no defense whatsoever against intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), contrary to what most Americans believe. If an ICBM were launched at the United States today -- by accident or design -- there is not a single thing the U.S. military could do to stop the warhead or multiple warheads from reaching their targets and killing hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Americans. In 1983, President Reagan began the Strategic Defense Initiative to end this utter vulnerability to the world's most terrible weapons. Yet the nation is no better protected from missile attack in 1996 than it was in 1983. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B considered this needless vulnerability in the context of the missile threat to the American people and to their forces, bases, and allies overseas. Team B concluded, unlike the Clinton Administration, that the threat is clear, present, and growing; and that it demands an urgent response.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As the least expensive and most effective solution to this global problem, <I>Defending America</I> recommended accelerated deployment of global wide-area defenses -- at sea within the next three to four years and in space by early in the next decade. These initiatives would restore key ballistic missile defense programs that the Clinton Administration sharply curtailed or canceled in 1993. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A year after the release of the Team B study, the United States remains undefended despite the best efforts of some Members of the 104th Congress -- and will likely remain undefended if the Administration's current policies prevail. Because missile defense remains a vital but unfulfilled national security requirement, The Heritage Foundation asked Team B to reconvene and take a look at what the Clinton Administration and Congress have done -- or failed to do -- to defend America. Team B has revalidated its basic approach of 1995, but also has concluded that the lack of progress in protecting Americans from ballistic missiles warrants this updated report in conjunction with the reissue of <I>Defending America</I>. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consequently, The Heritage Foundation is reissuing the Team B report along with this update, which reviews events of the past year that affect the missile defense effort, analyzes the negative impact of recent Clinton Administration missile defense program decisions, and discusses in more detail the Clinton Administration's negotiations with Russia on re-interpreting the ABM Treaty and extending the Treaty's limits to key theater defense systems.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this update, Team B offers a number of new recommendations to adjust to delays and negative developments in the missile defense program in the past year. The main conclusions are summarized as follows: 
<p><ul>
<li> Congress, and the U.S. Senate in particular, should seek ways to remove the obstacles to effective missile defenses posed by the ABM Treaty, including possible withdrawal from the treaty as the U.S. is entitled to do under Article XV.
<P>
<li> Congress should forego development of ground-based systems for national missile defense and accelerate deployment of sea-based, wide-area defenses. Without artificial performance constraints or limits imposed by the ABM Treaty, this system could counter threats against the U.S. homeland as well as regional threats from theater missiles, beginning by the year 2000. 
<p>

<li> Congress should accelerate the deployment of space-based sensors to enhance the effectiveness of both theater and national missile defense.
<p>
<li> Congress should direct the Air Force to develop follow-on space-based defenses, both kinetic energy interceptors and space-based lasers, to begin deployment early in the next decade. 
<p>
<li> Congress should ensure the Ballistic Missile Defense Office develops an integrated but open architecture for battle management, command, control, and communications to support missile defense systems.
</ul><p>
<b>WHAT TEAM B PROPOSED IN 1995</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1995, The Heritage Foundation Missile Defense Study Team proposed improvements or renewed emphasis in several missile defense program areas, in particular:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Sea-Based Wide-Area Defense.</b> Because the Navy already has invested almost $50 billion in its AEGIS cruisers and their infrastructure, modifications or modernization of the software, battle management system, and interceptors for the missile defense mission would cost only about $1 billion. The U.S. could then begin deploying defenses on AEGIS-equipped naval vessels by the end of this decade. For an investment of $2-3 billion, 650 defensive interceptors on 22 AEGIS cruisers could be at sea by 2001, achieving a limited global missile defense capability for the U.S. and for American forces and allies overseas. Team B pointed out that these highly mobile platforms could defend Americans in all 50 states from a limited long-range missile strike, as well as defend American troops and allies overseas, provided the full technological capability of the Navy missile defense system was not arbitrarily constrained or artificially compromised.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Brilliant Eyes Sensor System.</b> Team B recommended accelerating the <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space-based sensor to begin deployment by as early as 1999. This system would enhance the capability of all wide-area defense interceptor systems, wherever based.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Space-Based Defenses.</b> Team B recommended reviving space-based defense programs canceled by the Clinton Administration to provide deployment options beginning early in the next decade. This approach would be the most effective long-term defense to protect the American homeland and to counter advanced theater ballistic missiles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>ABM Treaty Limits.</b> Team B also recommended that defenses for America and American troops, bases, and allies overseas be built without arbitrarily restraining systems to comply with the outdated ABM Treaty. Codifying the Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) strategy of the Cold War, the ABM Treaty no longer makes sense in a multipolar world of proliferating nuclear powers.
<P>
<b>THE CLINTON RECORD ON MISSILE DEFENSE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Team B members are dismayed at the extent to which the Administration has undermined the ability of the United States to defend itself against the growing threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. It is a widely acknowledged characteristic of President Clinton and officials in his Administration that they say one thing and do another. Nowhere is this disingenuousness more evident than the Administration's position on weapons of mass destruction and their principal delivery systems -- ballistic missiles. 
<p>
<b>The Administration's Declaratory Policy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On November 14, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12938, declaring in part that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering such weapons constitutes "an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States," and that he therefore had decided to "declare a national emergency to deal with that threat."  A year later, on November 15, 1995, he issued a notice of the continuation of this "Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction."  This is a clear and indisputable evaluation of the immediate danger to the U.S. and its interests posed by "the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and the means of delivering such systems."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite this clear and unequivocal statement of U.S. policy, President Clinton vetoed the FY 1996 Defense Authorization Act on December 28, 1995. This legislation contained missile defense provisions intended specifically to meet the threat from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems. President Clinton based his veto primarily on his objection to the missile defense language in the Act, which called for defending all 50 American states by early in the next decade. According to the President, this would be a "costly defense system" against a threat that the "intelligence community does not foresee in the coming decade."  His veto message asserted that the missile defense provisions would "also jeopardize our efforts to agree on an ABM/TMD demarcation with the Russian Federation." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defense Secretary William Perry said on September 20, 1994, when announcing the results of the Clinton Administration's nuclear posture review, that his "number one priority is to put MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction) behind us for good, to replace it with Mutual Assured Safety."  But on May 10, 1995, President Clinton joined Russian President Boris Yeltsin in declaring the ABM Treaty -- which is based on MAD -- a "cornerstone of strategic stability."  Indeed, the Clinton Administration's theological commitment to the ABM Treaty is so strong that it refuses to exploit U.S. technological advantages to build the most effective defenses -- which are also the least costly defenses -- to protect the American people and their overseas troops, friends, and allies.
<p>
<b>More Administration Inconsistency</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Secretary Perry is as inconsistent as his commander in chief. On January 31, 1996, he told the Hoover Institution Board of Overseers that "we are pursuing, in my judgment, robustly, vigorously, a so-called theater missile defense program [which] will give us the capability of defending U.S. forces and U.S. allies against medium-range ballistic missiles. We are moving toward deployment -- the production and deployment of this system on a high-priority schedule where the first of the new generation of such defenses will begin their deployment in a few years."  In a press conference on February 16, the Secretary announced the results of a six-month Pentagon review of plans to defend the American people and their troops, friends, and allies overseas, stating: "I have no higher obligation as Secretary of Defense than to protect our forces and our territory. This program responds to threats as they develop, combines current and evolving technology to face today's threat and will enable us to develop new technologies to face tomorrow's threat from longer range missiles."<sup>2 </sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nevertheless, the content if not the rhetoric of the February 16 announcement was contrary to the clear intent of Congress, which last year increased the Administration's budget request for missile defense and directed that key programs be accelerated.<sup>3</sup>  Instead, the Clinton Administration has decided to slow these programs while cutting 15 percent from its previously planned budget -- a budget that already had been cut by about 60 percent below the missile defense plan of the Bush Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defense experts who were not misled by the responsible-sounding statements in Mr. Perry's February 16 press briefing realize that even the Administration's vaunted commitment to theater missile defense is highly questionable. Secretary Perry announced cuts in funding for both the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the Navy's AEGIS-based wide-area defense and proposed to delay deployment for both indefinitely -- in spite of congressional direction to deploy these two systems by 1999. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Furthermore, the Administration has decided to delay for at least three years a decision to deploy any defense of the American people, a delay that will most likely prove to be indefinite if the Clinton Administration continues in office beyond January 1997. The Administration has canceled or sharply curtailed development of the most effective, least expensive defenses. It is even stretching out development of the programs it is supporting, thereby increasing total system costs. It has reoriented the theater defense programs to the least capable systems, providing only limited protection to overseas troops, friends, and allies and denying the American people the inherent capability that would be afforded by fully exploiting modern technology.<sup>4</sup>  Similarly, deployment of <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space sensors was delayed at least six months while the Administration reviewed how to proceed. In short, the net effect of the Clinton Administration's policies and statements is to undermine deployment of effective theater and national missile defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These developments, apparent from the headlines of press reports from the briefing given on the Friday afternoon before a long holiday weekend,<sup>5</sup> are at sharp variance with last year's Team B report, which concluded that the threat is clear, present and growing. The factual evidence presented in <I>Defending America</I> demonstrated in particular that worldwide defenses against longer range missiles are urgently needed to counter blackmail threats that could limit U.S. involvement in future regional crises involving U.S. national interests. This kind of blackmail was illustrated recently when a Chinese official threatened to destroy Los Angeles if the U.S. interfered with China's feud with Taiwan.<sup>6</sup>  And on March 8, 1996, China conducted missile firing tests offshore near Taiwan's two largest cities as part of an ongoing campaign to intimidate Taiwan. These missile "tests" amounted to a <I>de facto</I> blockade, and further dramatized the use of ballistic missiles as weapons of coercive diplomacy as well as weapons of war.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The incoherence of the Administration's position on missile defense is further revealed by its handling of theater defenses, which it continues to claim are "first priority."  Seeking funds in a shrinking defense budget to offset shortfalls in other procurement accounts, the Administration is slowing its own theater defense program on the grounds that there is no imminent threat.<sup>7</sup>  Yet America's top commander in South Korea, General Gary Luck, asked that the THAAD (Theater High Altitude Area Defense) system be expedited to replace the Patriot system in light of growing tensions with North Korea. But General John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, justified turning down General Luck and delaying THAAD because, in his view, there is no new threat from North Korean missiles.<sup>8</sup>  Also, U.N. inspectors fear that an Iraqi missile program exposed last year is more extensive than previously thought and could enable Saddam Hussein to fire chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons at targets up to 2,000 miles away -- which would include all of the capitals of Europe.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The need for wide-area defenses -- surpassing the capability of THAAD -- could not be clearer. Short-range interceptors like <I>Patriot</I> and the Navy Lower Tier emphasized by the Clinton Administration will be ineffective against 2,000-mile-range ballistic missiles. They will have difficulty defeating even the Gulf War Scud, which broke up on reentry and became very hard to hit as its warhead "cork-screwed" its way toward the Earth. Neither of these theater systems currently being pursued by the Clinton Administration will be at all effective against missiles that release their warheads shortly after their boost phase, while they are rising in rocket-powered flight from their launchers. Yet there are reports that such missiles might be developed and "on the world market within the next five years."<sup>10</sup>  Thus, the missile threat demonstrably continues to grow and the Clinton Administration continues to resist committing the needed resources to protect the American people, their forward-deployed forces, and their allies. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's relaxed view of the threat and its inconsistent actions on missile defense are neither prudent nor responsible. It has become regrettably clear that the Clinton Administration cannot be relied upon to carry out its own stated policy. The President has created a political environment in which words mean nothing, in which the Administration's policy declarations merely conceal the failure to protect Americans against ballistic missiles. The Administration's actions over the past year demonstrate that the American people cannot depend upon the executive branch to fulfill its chief constitutional duty -- to provide for the common defense -- even though the missile threat continues to grow.
<p>
<b>ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE 1995 TEAM B REPORT</b>
<p>
<b>The President's Veto of the Defense Authorization Bill</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In crafting the missile defense provisions of the FY 1996 defense authorization bill, the congressional defense committees focused on limited, ABM Treaty-compliant, ground-based systems for the homeland defense mission. Team B recognizes that staunch supporters of missile defense in Congress chose to focus on ground-based defenses in order to garner the majority needed to pass the defense authorization bill. It was a tactical judgment call designed to "move the ball forward" toward actual deployment of National Missile Defense (NMD), even if only a few yards, and the bill as passed did direct the Clinton Administration to deploy, early in the next decade, a defense for the American homeland.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But on December 28, 1995, President Clinton vetoed the bill precisely because it mandated defending the American people by early in the next decade. The majority that had coalesced around a less than optimum NMD program was not sufficient to override the President's veto, and Congress was forced to strip out the offending section so that the defense authorization bill could be signed into law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While this was a severe setback for the defense of the United States, at least it clarified the missile defense debate. It is now clear that the Clinton Administration and the majority of the Democrats in Congress, who would not vote to override the veto, are willing to risk leaving the American people vulnerable to attack by even a single ballistic missile.
<p>
<b>"Explaining Away" the Need for Missile Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration argues that there is no ballistic missile threat to the American homeland and that there will be sufficient warning to build needed defenses before such a threat develops. In line with these assumptions, the Administration has structured a National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program. Over the next three years, it would develop components of an ABM Treaty-compliant ground-based defense which, in turn, could be deployed in another three years if, in the President's view, developments warrant it. It therefore intends to provide no defense for the American people before 2003 at the earliest. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet American cities can be destroyed today by Russian and Chinese missiles. One wonders whether the Clinton Administration believes it is "politically incorrect" to call attention to such possibilities. Furthermore, authoritative Administration officials testified to Congress last year that rogue states could threaten U.S. cities with long-range missile attack in three to five years -- or sooner if they chose to accelerate their development plans.<sup>12</sup>  Several Senators and Congressmen have expressed concern that the Clinton Administration politicized a recent National Intelligence Estimate so as to suggest a lesser threat to the United States than indicated in this previous testimony.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>The ABM Treaty -- or an ABM/TMD Treaty?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year Team B recommended an honest appraisal of the impediments to effective missile defense, including theater defense, posed by the 1972 ABM Treaty. To its great credit, the congressional leadership has sought throughout the past year to prevent Clinton negotiators from negotiating arbitrary constraints on theater missile defense systems that were never supposed to be limited by the ABM Treaty.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the Clinton Administration appears committed to "strengthening" this treaty. In talks to determine the demarcation between permitted theater defenses and ABM Treaty-limited strategic defenses, the Administration reportedly has accepted the Russian demand to limit the performance of the most promising theater defenses, including the Navy wide-area system. Only Russian recalcitrance and over-reaching in seeking greater restraints on theater missile defense have prevented consummation of the agreement and converting the ABM Treaty into an ABM-TMD treaty. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In demonstrating such a slavish adherence to a narrow interpretation of the ABM Treaty, the Administration in effect is binding the U.S. unilaterally to perceived rather than real treaty constraints. This theological devotion to the treaty has resulted in deliberate "dumbing down" of theater defense designs rather than making the systems as capable as available technology will permit. For example, the Navy wide-area defense is not being designed to exploit high velocity interceptors or external sensor data to maximize its reach, because that capability also would enable the system to defend the United States.<sup>15</sup>  The THAAD system is not being allowed to use any external sensor data to extend its reach and effectiveness.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the President's promise to "work closely with the Congress," he has largely ignored the concerns of Congress in favor of accommodating Russian demands to limit U.S. missile defenses through a renegotiated ABM Treaty. But Members of Congress are becoming increasingly disturbed at the Administration's position. Late last year, Representative Martin Hoke (R-OH) introduced a bill directing the Administration to exercise its rights to withdraw from the ABM Treaty,<sup>16</sup> though it has not yet been debated. More recently, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), introduced a similar bill in the Senate.<sup>17</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 With these bills pending, the stage is set for hearings and a serious debate in both the Senate and the House on these issues vital to the nation's security. If the Administration expands the ABM Treaty to cover advanced theater systems and also agrees to "multi-lateralize" the treaty by including the states of the former Soviet Union, it will be making substantive changes in the treaty. These changes must come before the Senate for its consent. Otherwise, the Senate's constitutional prerogatives in treaty-making will be undermined, as will national security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It has become manifestly clear that no effective defense of the American people can be built consistent with ABM Treaty limits. And if the Administration has its way, no highly effective theater defense will be built either. The Administration has shown clearly that it prefers defending the Treaty to defending Americans.
<p>
<b>TEAM B RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B believes the congressional leadership, having made clear its fundamental differences with the Administration, should press for deployment of the least expensive, most effective near-term defenses technically achievable. Moreover, Team B concludes that the ABM Treaty must be dealt with in a manner consistent with these primary objectives. Recommendations to meet the latest developments are to:
<p><ul>
<li> Review the Clinton Administration's ballistic missile threat assessment and direct a more prudent approach to accelerate the development of appropriate responses;
<p>
<li> Review the role of the ABM Treaty in artificially limiting the development of the most effective defenses now technologically feasible and direct that the most effective, affordable near-term defenses be developed unconstrained by the ABM Treaty and then deployed at an accelerated pace;
<p>
<li> Use all available congressional powers and prerogatives to move the U.S. toward withdrawal from the ABM Treaty after giving six months' notice, which it has the right to do under Article XV;
<p>
<li> Redirect last year's consensus objective of deploying ground-based U.S. homeland defenses by 2003 and focus it instead on beginning deployment of sea-based wide-area defenses by the year 2000, unconstrained by the ABM Treaty;
<p>
<li> Direct the Air Force to accelerate deployment of <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space-based sensors beginning as early as 1999, to enhance the effectiveness of both theater and U.S. homeland defenses;
<p>
<li> Direct the Air Force to develop follow-on space-based defenses -- both kinetic-energy interceptors and space-based lasers -- for deployment early in the next decade;
<p>
<li> Direct the Army to focus its efforts on developing and deploying ground-based theater missile defenses to support overseas U.S. troops and allies; restore the $2 billion recently removed by the Administration from the multi-year THAAD budget; and re-establish 2000 as the initial deployment date;
<p>
<li> Direct the Ballistic Missile Defense Office to assure development of an integrated but open architecture for the battle management, command, control, and communications to support these defense systems.
</ul><p>
<b>Revised Spending Plan</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress's failure to override the President's veto of the FY 1996 defense bill demonstrates the futility of pursuing relatively expensive yet less effective ground-based national missile defenses in the hope of getting at least some anti-missile protection deployed. Team B believes Congress instead should direct the accelerated development and deployment of the most effective sea-based and space-based wide-area defenses. Developing a boost-phase intercept capability with these and other systems also should be a high priority. These systems also will defend American forces and allies abroad, reducing the requirements for ground-based theater missile defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This approach will require that missile defense funds, including those already appropriated and those currently being applied to the Clinton Administration's so-called 3+3 Deployment Readiness Program, be spent instead on sea- and space-based defense programs. The highest priority should be assigned to deploying the Navy wide-area defense beginning in the year 2000. This would provide the earliest U.S. homeland defense. Evolutionary improvements to increase its effectiveness should occur as the relevant technologies mature. This is needed to maximize the system's ability to protect the U.S. homeland. Second, the development of space-based sensors and space-based defenses, both kinetic-energy interceptors and lasers, should be revived and accelerated. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a href="bg1074t1.gif">Table 1</a> provides recommended funding levels, including additional funds in 1996 which can be accommodated by reprogramming funds already appropriated under the National Missile Defense program element from ground-based defenses to sea- and space-based defenses. (The recommended funding is consistent with last year's Team B report, given that six months of FY 1996 already have been lost.)
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As discussed in last year's Team B report, the out-year funding needed for space-based systems will depend on development activities during the next three years. However, Team B continues to believe that the two space-based defense systems are complementary. In fact, for a given effectiveness against advanced threats, it can be shown that the least expensive space-based defense involves both. With the necessary funding, deployment can begin shortly after the year 2000. For planning purposes consistent with this objective, Team B recommends that $1.6 billion, $2.4 billion, and $3 billion, respectively, be budgeted for 1999, 2000, and 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This recommendation to forego continued commitment to a ground-based defense for protection of the U.S. homeland is intended to address the inherent shortcomings of ground-based systems discussed in the 1995 Team B report. In short, they can be overcome by likely countermeasures, they are expensive, and they are difficult to deploy in peacetime -- even more so in crisis or war. The Clinton Administration suggests that a very limited "ABM Treaty compliant" single site defense might cost less than $5 billion.<sup>18</sup>  Team regards this as a waste of scarce missile defense dollars. Such a significant expenditure of funds on relatively ineffective ground-based defenses will only delay building urgently needed, more effective, and less expensive sea-based and space-based defenses. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Team B recommends that FY 1996 funds for National Missile Defense (NMD) be redirected from the ground-based NMD program now planned toward accelerating more effective and less expensive sea-based and space-based wide area defense programs. Future NMD funds should be directed toward providing evolutionary technical improvements to the initial Navy wide-area defense system in order to give it the most capable performance against the full spectrum of future threats to the United States. The NMD budget line should also include about $150 million per year to continue programs to defeat countermeasures and support critical sensor programs that will enhance the midcourse intercept capability of all defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The recommended funding for the technology line would restore key efforts against likely countermeasures. The most important countermeasure anticipated in the relatively near future is a "clustered submunition" that disperses numerous warheads shortly after a missile's boost phase is completed. This countermeasure would overcome the limited theater missile defenses currently being developed by the Clinton Administration. To defeat it would require a boost-phase defense -- that is, destroying the entire missile/warhead package before the submunitions can be released. But all boost-phase defenses that could be deployed in the near term were canceled by the Clinton Administration in 1993. Restoring them therefore should receive high priority. The funding recommended above should be sufficient for a technology demonstration within three years of a high-acceleration boost-phase interceptor like the <I>Raptor Talon</I> concept.
<p>
<b>The Final Hurdle: The ABM Treaty</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B again recommends that Congress do all within its power to restrain the Clinton Administration's penchant for negotiating additional treaty limits on U.S. defenses. Instead, the U.S. should indicate clearly to the Russians that the U.S. intends to provide effective wide area defenses for the American people and their overseas troops, friends, and allies -- and that it would prefer to do so with Russia's agreement. However, the U.S. should be explicitly clear that unless Russia begins to cooperate immediately, it will exercise its right to withdraw from the ABM Treaty and proceed to build defenses unilaterally.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It should be obvious to any competent U.S. negotiator that the Russians will agree only if they believe that the U.S. is prepared to proceed unilaterally. The best way to move in this direction is to announce that the strategic situation has changed significantly since the ABM Treaty was negotiated in 1972 and that, because the new world disorder presents a number of potential threats to America's supreme interests, the U.S. intends to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. If the treaty no longer serves America's national security interests, the U.S. has every right to withdraw, and this right is made clear in Article XV. Once this step is taken the U.S. should proceed to build the effective defenses recommended above as quickly as possible.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration refuses to give serious consideration to building an effective missile defense program, whether to protect the U.S. homeland or U.S. troops abroad. Team B continues to recommend that global defenses be deployed urgently -- initially from the sea and then from space. These are the least expensive and most effective defenses possible, and the U.S. can begin their deployment by the end of the decade if it has the political will to do so. As Team B concluded in 1995, the ultimate issue in the missile defense debate is not technology, nor even cost, but political will.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The test of the nation's political will to defend itself -- and a test of the U.S. Senate's determination to defend its constitutional prerogatives -- will be in dealing with the 1972 ABM Treaty. Some in Congress and the defense community believe the ABM Treaty is not a near-term problem; they think dealing with the treaty can be deferred to some distant future. But they are wrong. The ABM Treaty is stifling the development of today's most capable and effective defense systems and perpetuating the vulnerability of the American people and their troops, bases, and allies overseas. Continuing to appease the Russians in ABM Treaty negotiations delays U.S. efforts to build needed defenses, and may permanently impair American interests. Team B believes that U.S. supreme interests are threatened by realities that are fundamentally different from those of the Cold War. The time has come for the U.S. to exercise its Article XV right and, as a matter of supreme national interest, withdraw from the ABM Treaty and build the needed defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution confers on the U.S. Congress the power and the duty to "provide for the common Defence."  This entails the raising, support, and regulation of the nation's armed forces. In other words, Congress shares the responsibility for national security with the President, the commander in chief. This shared but direct responsibility for the security of the nation is an important element of the constitutional system of checks and balances.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration continues to keep Americans vulnerable while hiding behind a smokescreen of positive sounding but meaningless policy declarations. It is now clear that the Clinton Administration will remain derelict in the duties required of the office of the commander in chief by failing to provide for the common defense. Congress must fulfill its constitutional duty to check the excesses of the executive branch. It must stop the improper attempts to broaden the ABM Treaty and counterbalance the executive's dereliction of duty by pressing for the most capable and effective missile defense technology permits. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Someday soon, it is a near certainty that U.S. forces abroad, and possibly even the U.S. homeland, will come under ballistic missile attack. Such an attack may occur with missiles carrying chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads. If that day comes, the American people will hold responsible all those in positions of public trust who failed to carry out their constitutional and moral duty.

<li>    It is commonly though incorrectly assumed that the technology is most mature for ground-based defenses because such defenses have been under development longest, and that such defenses are the least expensive. In fact, effective wide-area defenses can be deployed sooner at sea and in space. Contrary to conventional wisdom, advances in technology have been flowing from research on space-based systems to ground-based systems, not the other way around. Finally, as discussed in the 1995 Team B report, sea-based and space-based defenses would be far less expensive and more effective in providing the needed wide-area defensive coverage.<p>
<li>    See Senate Select Committee on Intelligence news release, "Senate Intelligence Committee Releases Unclassified Intelligence Assessments," May 1, 1995.<p>
<li>    Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) discussed his misgivings with the "new" NIE in a January 18, 1996, speech at an AIAA conference in Monterey, California (mimeograph). See also Rowan Scarborough and Bill Gertz, "Missile-Threat Report 'Politicized,' GOP Says," <I>The Washington Times</I>, January 30, 1996, p.

 <li>   Over the past year, at least seven letters from the congressional leadership have directed the Clinton Administration to cease its efforts to limit theater and U.S. homeland defenses and to "multilateralize" the ABM Treaty -- even to halt the negotiations that seem determined to proceed in this direction despite repeated statements of congressional concern. See, for example, Bill Gertz, "Deal With Russia Could Hamper Missile Defenses," <I>The Washington Times</I>, December 4, 1995. In one of the most recent letters, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and 12 chairmen of defense and foreign affairs committees and subcommittees wrote President Clinton on February 12, 1996, expressing their strong objections to continuing negotiations with Russia that "will impede our ability to defend America and its interests" and indicating their intent to hold related hearings in the near future.<p>
<li>    Then Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch explained to the Navy League on April 13, 1995, that the Clinton Administration's version of the Navy Upper Tier -- or wide area -- defense was treaty-compliant because it was constrained to use only data from the SPY-1 radar co-located with its interceptors. See Bill Gertz, "Navy Missile Defense Shouldn't Be Issue In Talks," <I>The Washington Times</I>, April 14, 1995, p. A3. What he did not reveal was that this constraint, especially in conjunction with the interceptor velocity limits being discussed with the Russians, limits the Navy system's effectiveness as a theater defense system and precludes it from having a capability to defend the U.S.<p>
 <li>  Kerry Gildee, "Bill Introduced in House Calls for U.S. to Abandon ABM Treaty," <I>Defense Daily</I>, October 18, 1995, p. 77.<p>
<li>   Bill Gertz, "Helms Wants U.S. Out of ABM Treaty," <I>The Washington Times</I>, February 7, 1996, p. A3.<p>
 <li>   The least expensive (perhaps $2-3 billion) and nearest term (perhaps within four years) ground-based defense would involve modifying Minuteman missiles and command and control software to exploit the current Minuteman infrastructure. However, this system would have limited capability against only a few missiles (in his April 27, 1995, testimony before the House Budget Committee, Defense Secretary Perry acknowledged that a defense would be needed against several times this number -- i.e. 10-20 warheads; on September 28, 1995, he told the Regional Commerce and Growth Association of St. Louis, Missouri, that a reasonable attack to design against would include "several dozen missiles"). There are likely to be substantial operational constraints (how would the U.S. persuade Russia that Minuteman defensive missiles launched at North Korean missiles were not Minuteman offensive missiles launched at Russia?), and these missiles would be less effective than sea-based wide-area defenses that could be deployed as soon for the same price -- and defend American overseas troops, friends, and allies as well.<p>
<li>    During the past year, bills that support this policy have been introduced in the Senate by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) and in the House by Representative Martin Hoke (R-OH). Hearings and floor debate could be very useful in firming up a clear U.S. policy regarding the need to move beyond the ABM Treaty and build effective defenses that increase the security of the U.S. and its friends and allies in the post-Cold War world.

<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i><br>
March-April 1996, Number 76</b>


<h2>Big-Government Junkies</h2>
<b>by John P. Walters</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The great budget debate between President Clinton and Congress is about more than the level of federal spending and taxes. The fundamental conflict is over the responsibility for addressing America's great social crises. President Clinton wants Washington -- Congress, federal bureaucrats, federal judges -- in charge. Republicans in Congress argue that Big Government has failed to address the human needs of America. They want to return that responsibility to where it has historically rested -- with families, communities, churches and synagogues, and state and local governments.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The conflict was dramatically illustrated when Clinton threw down the gauntlet last January in his State of the Union address: "I challenge Congress not to cut out support for drug-free schools." In June 1995, the president  vetoed legislation to limit the Department of Education's "Drug-Free Schools and Communities" program. With teenage drug use rising rapidly since 1992, who could oppose antidrug programs for America's youth? But the central question is who bears the responsibility for taking action. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The GOP Congress voted last year to cut by 60 percent the $465-million budget for the antidrug program. With cameras rolling, Clinton vetoed the bill in the Rose Garden and called Republicans "extremists" opposed to drug education. His message shows how federal programs diffuse responsibility and undermine citizenship at the local level. No one doubts the importance of reducing illegal drug use. And the federal government has important responsibilities in the fight against illegal drugs: targeting drug trafficking from abroad, for example, as well as interstate commerce in illegal substances and money-laundering.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But teaching children that drug use is wrong and harmful is primarily the responsibility of parents and local communities -- youth organizations, religious institutions, schools, and police. Federal funding is neither necessary nor sufficient for conveying this lesson by word and deed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, the program in question provides roughly $7.25 per pupil. So by the time this money makes its way through the various state and local bureaucracies, many schools receive less than $3 per student. The president suggests that all those parents and teachers who seek to dissuade young people from using illegal drugs will cease to do so if they fail to receive a federal subsidy of $3 a child.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Drug-Free Schools program began in 1987 during the Reagan administration's expansion of the war on drugs. With good intentions, Congress and the executive branch decided to spend more on federal, state, and local efforts to prevent and treat drug abuse and enforce narcotics laws. Our nation's leaders were particularly anxious to contain the explosion in crack addiction. Later, it became clear that crack use had peaked in 1985 and declined rapidly -- proving that efforts by parents and communities were working long before any federal program tried to "help" them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The federal government increased the appropriation for the Drug-Free Schools program from $200 million in 1987 to more than $624 million in 1992, but paid very little attention to what was actually happening to them. According to former Michigan drug czar Bob Peterson, "The health-education lobby misled educators into believing that drugs only pose another personal health choice. In doing so, federal drug funds underwrote controversial sex-education expansion and condom giveaways and enriched health-education consultants." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before Governor Engler and the state's education department put a stop to it, $32 million in antidrug funds were diverted to the Michigan Model for Comprehensive School Health. More than $81,000 was used to purchase giant plastic teeth and toothbrushes. Kids who brush, said the "experts," do not use drugs. Another $1.5 million was spent on models of the human torso that were used just once. A Washington, D.C., school used federal antidrug money to take its basketball team to a restaurant. According to testimony before a congressional committee, 400 students at Dallas's Sunset High School received "A"s for a federally funded course about substance abuse that never met and had no teacher.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the damage is much greater than fiscal waste. Such federal grants do not empower local communities; instead, they turn the federal government into a tax collector for state and local educational bureaucracies and in so doing make them wasteful and unaccountable to their communities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However well-intentioned, the nationalization of local obligations undermines responsibility and accountability. By claiming that effective antidrug education depends largely on federal programs, President Clinton has done America's youth a tremendous disservice. Parents, teachers, and communities should not leave to the federal government a responsibility that really belongs to them.

<p><center><b><font size=5>Reality check</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We received an interesting invitation to a video conference in Washington honoring Women's History Month, titled &quot;Sexual Harassment 1996: Scholarly Definitions &amp; Everyday Realities.&quot;

<BR><DD>And wouldn't you know that Anita Faye Hill, who charged she was sexually harassed by Clarence Thomas, is the featured special guest panelist. The video conference will take place March 27 at the Biz Net Studios in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Building.

<BR><DD>We're told that Paula Corbin Jones, who has brought sexual harassment charges against President Clinton, will not be participating.

<p><center><b><font size=5>Kooks on kooks</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Democrats are finding that the World Wide Web is an effective means for distributing news, information and even a political jab or two to a large audience.

<BR><DD>Taking a peek at one of the Democratic Policy Committee's well-designed Web pages - http:// www.randomhouse.com/site/ election96/carville/ - we find links to such items as the &quot;Ridiculous Republican of the Week,&quot; the &quot;Republican Hatchet Job of the Week,&quot; the &quot;Republican Myth of the Week&quot; and, last but not least, the &quot;Republican Kook of the Week.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Say anything</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>It's an election year, and President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore certainly aren't fooling anybody, but for the sake of the youth of our nation, that's OK with Sen. Orrin G. Hatch.

<BR><DD>&quot;President Clinton has let the country down because of his failure to lead on the drug issue,&quot; the Utah Republican said. &quot;We have gone from a 'just say no' program under President Reagan to pleading with President Clinton to just say something.

<BR><DD>&quot;If the president is finally beginning to speak out more because it is a political year - I know he just held a conference on some aspects of this problem - then I say it is better late than never. I commend him for it.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Bunning and the boys</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Pitcher-turned-congressman Jim Bunning is one of four baseball greats elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The Kentucky Republican, 64, won 224 games with the Detroit Tigers, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates over 17 seasons.

<BR><DD>Rep. Henry J. Hyde, Illinois Republican, got to deliver the news about the future Hall of Famer's election to the House.

<BR><DD>In doing so, he told the story of when Mr. Bunning was pitching against the New York Yankees, who had a first-base coach named Bob Turley, &quot;a former pitcher who was very skilled at stealing signs. Every time Jim would throw a fastball, Turley would whistle, and the batters knew what the pitch was,&quot; Mr. Hyde noted.

<BR><DD>&quot;Now, the first batter up was Bobby Richardson, and Jim got him out. The second batter up was Tony Kubek, the shortstop. Jim got him out. The third batter stepped in, Mickey Mantle, and Jim walked over to the first-base coach, Turley, and he said, 'If you whistle, I am going to hit him right in the back with a pitch.'

<BR><DD>&quot;Jim took the mound. He got his sign, and he was at the top of his windup when Turley whistled. Jim decided to cross everybody up. He threw a slider. It got away from him, and hit Mantle right in the back. Mantle headed toward the mound with his bat, but decided better of it, and trotted down to first base.

<BR><DD>&quot;The next batter was Yogi Berra. Yogi stepped in, pounded the plate, looked at Jim Bunning and said, 'Hey, Jim, if Turley whistles, I ain't listening.'&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>The Wright stuff</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper, who was the oldest member of Congress when he died in 1989 at 88, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1937. A liberal, he was on Capitol Hill to fight for Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and against Ronald Reagan's conservative revolution.

<BR><DD>Last week, Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, North Dakota Democrat, recalled the week he first set foot in Congress and walked into the office of Mr. Pepper, &quot;and I saw something I have not forgotten.&quot;

<BR><DD>On the wall behind Mr. Pepper's desk, the senator remembered, &quot;was an autographed picture of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight. And it was autographed, 'To Congressman Claude Pepper,' by Orville Wright. ...

<BR><DD>&quot;Then, hanging just above that, was a picture of Neil Armstrong setting his foot on the moon, autographed, 'To Congressman Claude Pepper.'&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>We got you, boys</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>A tremendous audience of 250 people showed up for a news conference recently at which the national retail sales tax was unveiled. The legislation would abolish the Internal Revenue Service, the federal income tax and inheritance taxes, replacing them with a retail sales tax of about 15 percent.

<BR><DD>Republican Reps. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana and Dan Schaefer of Colorado are co-sponsors of the legislation, although fellow Rep. Sonny Bono, California Republican, dropped by to see why the big audience.

<BR><DD>Introducing the former Hollywood entertainer, Mr. Tauzin noted: &quot;You know, when Sonny wrote the song 'I Got You, Babe,' it was really the theme song for the IRS.&quot;

<BR><DD>To which Mr. Bono quipped: &quot;Billy and Dan, you guys have got a lot of courage for sponsoring this legislation, because you know you're going to get audited!&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Pork alert</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We've just examined the 1996 Congressional Pig Book, released by Citizens Against Government Waste.

<BR><DD>&quot;Rolling out the pork barrel and having a barrel of fun has long been one of Washington's more unseemly traditions, and few indeed have shown the will to resist its temptations,&quot; notes the 600,000-member, nonpartisan organization in the introduction.

<BR><DD>First, the criteria for pork: requested by only one chamber of Congress; not specifically authorized; not competitively awarded; not requested by the president; greatly exceeds the president's budget request; not the subject of congressional hearings; and serves only a local or special interest.

<BR><DD>Second, a few examples of pork 1996-style, followed by CAGW reaction:

<UL>
<LI>$395,000 awarded in conference for rice modeling at the University of Arkansas and the University of Missouri. &quot;Uncle Ben, not Uncle Sam, should be funding this research.&quot;

<LI>$3.75 million by the Senate for wood-utilization research from Maine to Oregon. &quot;How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if he had $3.75 million?&quot;

<LI>$1 million by the Senate for outreach for socially disadvantaged farmers.

<LI>$1 million by the Senate for research on the brown tree snake. &quot;The Brown Tree Snake, which is found only in Guam, has not been discovered to be life-threatening to humans, nor does it have the ability to survive in North America.&quot;
</UL>
<p><center><b><font size=5>Real death</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>A government notice states: &quot;According to the National Center for Health Statistics, tobacco, diet and alcohol are the three leading causes of actual death in the U.S.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Talk about reporters</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Carrie Klein, a former aide to Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, Oregon Republican, compiled the congressional index that appears in the 1996 Media Studies Journal, published by Columbia University. One portion notes:

<BR><DD>&quot;Number of journalists accredited to the Senate and House press galleries: 7,142.

<BR><DD>&quot;Ratio of journalists to congressmen: 16:1.

<BR><DD>&quot;Ratio of journalists to senators: 71:1.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Sweet dreams</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Sen. Jesse Helms, North Carolina Republican, was on hand at the White House March 12 to witness President Clinton sign long-awaited legislation to tighten sanctions against Cuba.

<BR><DD>Emerging from the signing ceremony, Mr. Helms encountered a horde of reporters in the White House driveway, one of whom pointed out: &quot;You know, the Cuban government says repeatedly that this law is going to have no impact, that in reality the other governments are not going to pay attention to what it says, on the contrary it's illegal because it goes against NAFTA and GATT. What's your impression? Do you think -&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Well,&quot; interrupted Mr. Helms, &quot;will you deliver a message to the Cuban government for me?&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Well,&quot; replied the reporter, &quot;I can't -&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Dream on!&quot; Mr. Helms told the Cuban government.

<BR><DD>&quot;... but I'm sure they're hearing it,&quot; the reporter said.

<p><center><b><font size=5>Sea to shining sea</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We've intercepted a memo from the U.S. Coast Guard commandant's office that says Transportation Secretary Federico Pena &quot;has requested that the department commemorate Earth Day, April 22, 1996, with a celebration that reaches across the country from headquarters to our field units.&quot;

<BR><DD>It continues: &quot;This is an ideal opportunity to recognize every individual's role and responsibility and to reinforce one of the Coast Guard's most important missions, 'Protecting Our Environment.' This year's theme is 'Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.'&quot;

<BR><DD>The memo directs all field units &quot;to plan and participate in Earth Day festivities either by conducting Earth Day observations at your units ... or by contributing to local community Earth Day celebrations.&quot;

<BR><DD>It also requests that each unit provide in advance to the commandant's office a list and description of planned Earth Day activities.

<BR><DD>The Earth Day tradition was launched in the United States in 1970, shortly after the Cuyahoga River caught fire.

<P>
The mood was euphoric. The tone one of bravado. &quot;We're looking
for horror stories. We're going to change the way things are done
around here!&quot; Thus spoke one Congressman shortly after the
November 1994 election. The targets? The Endangered Species Act,
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, all environmental regulations,
and especially the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<BR>

<P>
By 1996, the mood was sober; the tone confused. Congressional
reformers of the 104th Congress had failed to institute hoped-for
changes in environmental regulations. &quot;The stumbling block
to reform,&quot; admitted a Congressional staffer at a January
1996 retreat, &quot;is the vision thing&quot; - how reformers
define and understand basic environmental policy challenges.<BR>

<P>
What is needed is an environmental vision that combines an appreciation
of the general environmental psyche of the nation with a respect
for the diverse values people hold. This means finding approaches
to environmental problems that economize on the need for consensus
- that limit instances in which non-voluntary collective decisions
are sought - while reinforcing incentives for personal environmental
stewardship. <BR>

<P>
Reformers also need a plausible picture of how the world works
- how one identifies environmental problems, assembles information
relevant to minimizing these problems and maintains incentives
- within firms and among individuals - to apply that information.
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="vision"></a><B>The &quot;Vision Thing&quot;<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The &quot;old vision&quot; that shaped the past quarter-century
of environmental policies offered lofty images of Mother Nature
and a better world. Its language of poetry - and sometimes fear
- captivated the imagination of the American public. And, translated
into public policies, the old vision produced some successes.
<BR>

<P>
But, as Horatio warned Hamlet, &quot;All is not well.&quot; The
record of environmental gains tells only part of the environmental
story. The rest of the story - high costs and growing conflict
- are the driving forces behind appeals for environmental policy
reform. Three features of the old vision made high conflict and
high costs a likely outcome.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="values"></a><B>Values<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
First is the matter of values. The old environmental vision often
implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, portrayed environmental
values as absolute - as somehow more important than other values.
The result has been an endorsement of &quot;zero emission&quot;
goals and remediation standards in which little consideration
is given to costs. &quot;If Mother Nature didn't put it in,&quot;
one California regulator recently told me, &quot;you had to take
it out - everything - that was the goal. This drove us to rigid,
grossly exuberant attempts at clean up.&quot;<BR>

<P>
But this view that environmental values are absolute cannot be
right. Environmental values, while important, are situated among
a cluster of values that constitute quality-of-life. People seek
health, safety, nourishment, shelter, learning, companionship,
aesthetic enrichment and personal accomplishment, along with environmental
protections. And it is often difficult for outsiders - or even
individuals themselves - to know in advance how they would prefer
to trade off among different wants.<BR>

<P>
Most people want all good things, including environmental protection.
Year after year, opinion polls demonstrate (at least in the abstract)
a commitment to environmental values. Any successful reform effort
must appreciate this commitment.<BR>

<P>
But general societal trends do not erase particular differences
among individuals. Environmental values are more important for
some people than for others. And, for any particular individual,
some environmental values are more important than others. A new
environmental vision must depart from the old way of thinking
by recognizing the need to find ways in which individuals and
particular communities can undertake their own balancing among
these many values.<BR>

<P>
Environmental problem-solving is about making choices. The challenge,
however, is not simply one of deciding what's to be done. The
challenge is also one of determining &quot;who should decide&quot;
and &quot;how.&quot; Recognizing that people have diverse values
establishes one constraint in thinking about &quot;who shall decide.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="knowledge"></a><B>The Knowledge Problem<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
A second constraint is what Nobel laureate F.A. Hayek called the
&quot;knowledge problem&quot; - how societies create and access
information relevant to making decisions about the allocation
of time and resources. <BR>

<P>
The old vision viewed the information challenge as one of identifying
general environmental problems and then specifying uniform remedies
to those problems. Information relevant to environmental problem-solving
was perceived to be the sort that could be collected and centralized
within an agency of experts, then translated into a series of
one-size-fits-all regulations that prescribed acceptable technologies,
clean-up methods and single-purpose wilderness management plans.
The result was often an attitude that &quot;bureaucrats know best.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
This old vision was partly right about &quot;knowledge.&quot;
Many environmental problems do involve matters of &quot;general
knowledge&quot; - scientific understanding of facts that are constant
across time and space. Sometimes this scientific knowledge is
a matter of settled understanding: the boiling point of water,
for instance, or the bonding patterns of chemicals. EPA uses this
kind of knowledge to develop ways of detecting chemical concentrations
in polluted soils. <BR>

<P>
In other instances, scientific knowledge is a matter of ongoing
research and scientific contention: What, for example, are the
health hazards of various substances or the effects of carbon
dioxide on climate? Or is concentration of a chemical in the soil
a useful indicator of risk to humans and ecosystems? Much environmental
debate takes place over issues of general knowledge, and these
questions are important. But they are not the whole story.<BR>

<P>
Environmental problems and problem-solving also often involve
what Hayek called &quot;specific knowledge&quot; - the knowledge
of time, place and experience. This information varies by circumstance
and location and may change over time. Specific knowledge is decentralized
- it resides on the factory floor, on a specific farm and at a
particular Superfund site.<BR>

<P>
The impacts of a landfill in the desert will differ from those
near the Florida Everglades. Whether incorporating recycled content
into a package optimizes resource efficiency will depend on the
material, the availability of alternative materials, particular
production processes and other product-specific details. Using
two coats of oil-based paint will have different impacts than
using just one coat.<BR>

<P>
These kinds of details do not reside in the minds of bureaucrats
in Washington - or even within state agencies. Yet this is the
kind of knowledge that is often most relevant to understanding
specific environmental problems and the merits of different remedies.
<BR>

<P>
The narrow framing of the &quot;knowledge problem&quot; captured
in the regulatory reform bills proposed in the early part of the
104th Congress did not address this problem of dynamic and decentralized
information. The first prong of the &quot;knowledge problem&quot;
- how to better incorporate available general knowledge into public
policy - dominated that debate. Proponents of the 1995 regulatory
reform bills viewed the essential problem as one of irrationality.
They called for more professionalism and better planners. The
Big Fix, they argued, would come from the twin icons of rationalism:
hard science and good economics.<BR>

<P>
This emphasis on costs and the denunciation of regulations directed
at trivial risks is common sense stuff. An effort to introduce
better science and economic analysis into environmental decision-making
may yield more efficient and sensible policies.<BR>

<P>
But matters of high cost and poorly chosen goals are really derivative
problems. They are a predictable (and lamentable) product of a
mismatch between top-down, micromanaging decision processes and
the world as it is: complex, dynamic and full of particulars rather
than generalities.<BR>

<P>
A reform agenda that simply superimposes cost-benefit decision
constraints on regulators does not get at the kinds of information
problems inherent in a complex, dynamic world full of location-specific
details. Attending to the knowledge problem means, instead, thinking
about what institutions and decision-making processes will create
information feedback loops and facilitate access to relevant knowledge
of time, place, and experience.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="firm"></a><B>The Individual, the Firm and the Marketplace<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
This challenge brings us to the third feature of the old environmental
vision - its perception of the individual, the firm and the marketplace.
The old vision viewed industry and economic dynamism as a central
cause of environmental degradation. Pollution was not just a problem;
it was evil. And the motives of participants in this economic
growth dynamo were suspect. <BR>

<P>
This view is a recipe for emphasizing sticks, not carrots. It
is also a recipe for emphasizing fines and punishment rather than
problem-solving.<BR>

<P>
As journalist Gregg Easterbrook shows in <B>A Moment on Earth</B>,
his 1,000-plus pages tome on environmental progress, our air and
water are cleaner; wolves again prowl in once-abandoned forests;
and, ospreys fish in once-polluted waters. Easterbrook implicitly
attributes most of these reported gains to three decades of regulation.
Forgotten by Easterbrook and most other chroniclers of environmental
gains is the role that marketplace ingenuity, market prices and
private stewardship have played in environmental progress. This
myopia means the reform agenda has been mostly about fine-tuning
regulations, not rethinking the nation's basic approach to environmentalism.
<BR>

<P>
Yet the incentives promoted by a competitive marketplace have
yielded phenomenal improvements in how efficiently we use resources.
In an essay on technology and environment, Jesse Ausubel reports
that the telecommunications industry now consumes 65 pounds of
silica to create a cable that can carry 1,000 times more messages
than cable made from one ton of copper. A handful of sand versus
a ton of copper represents an environmental triumph of a competitive
marketplace that nudges manufacturers to use less stuff.<BR>

<P>
These trends have occurred in things both great and small. On
the one hand are construction-industry gains, where technology
improvements mean builders can use one-third the materials once
needed to build a high-rise building. At the other end of the
spectrum is the diminutive soda can. In the 1960s, producers required
164 pounds of metal to produce 1,000 soda cans; today they use
around 33 pounds of metal.<BR>

<P>
These gains result not only in &quot;doing more with less.&quot;
They also reduce the &quot;environmental footprint&quot; - the
pollution and waste - associated with producing a given product.
<BR>

<P>
This picture of progress is, of course, imperfect. Two decades
of economic literature have described the &quot;tragedy of the
commons,&quot; in which resources are &quot;owned&quot; by everyone
and thus are essentially owned by no one, since they can be used
indiscriminately by everyone. Under these circumstances, each
person has an incentive to consume as much as possible, as fast
as possible, rather than preserve and protect resources for future
use.<BR>

<P>
This &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; applies to unowned lands;
it also applies to air basins, oceans and many other water bodies.
<BR>

<P>
Sometimes, the resolution to these commons problems lies in clarifying
rights and strengthening markets, as some environmental economists
have argued for twenty years - occasionally successfully. Environmental
writer Tom Wolf describes a &quot;Ranching for Wildlife&quot;
program in Colorado that borrows from the ideas of these environmental
economists. In the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, elk on public and
private lands compete with cattle for forage. The challenge, suggests
Wolf, is &quot;to figure out how ranchers can capture value from
the elk.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Hunters will pay as much as $8,000 for a license to hunt trophy
elk. But until Colorado passed its Ranching for Wildlife law,
landowners were unable to take part in potential revenues from
the sale of hunting licenses. Under Ranching for Wildlife, the
state still &quot;owns&quot; the wildlife, but owners of large
ranches can auction off a designated number of hunting licenses
that guarantee trophy elk. The program, in effect, has partially
privatized elk-hunting rights. Participating ranch owners now
manage their lands to provide suitable habitat for elk. They also
vigilantly guard against poaching of young bull elk.<BR>

<P>
But some problems - and many air pollution problems fall into
this category - are not easily divisible into private &quot;spheres
of stewardship.&quot; And one person's choices directly affect
others. These problems involve situations in which defining and
enforcing individual rights are costly. These high &quot;transactions
costs,&quot; as economist Ronald Coase called them, inhibit the
emergence of contractual arrangements in which all affected parties
voluntarily work out an allocation of rights and responsibilities.
<BR>

<P>
Thinking about the problems of indivisibility and transaction
costs introduces a central challenge for environmental reform.
Fully private, individual decisions are not always possible. Regulatory
decisions are often undesirable, since they suppress localized
information and impose a single-value hierarchy. And reliance
on courts to resolve all disputes about pollution and other social
&quot;nuisances&quot; can be divisive and costly. Needed is a
way of sorting out which collective decision-making arrangements,
under which circumstances, enhance expression of environmental
values at least cost. <BR>

<P>
The old environmental vision fostered passage of command-and-control
laws that gave scant attention to costs and regulated large and
small problems indiscriminately. That vision nurtured laws that
stirred up adversarial relationships between regulators and the
regulated. It formed the basis for a blueprint destined to divide
communities.<BR>

<P>
A new environmental vision must be compatible with a complex,
dynamic world in which quality-of-life comprises many values,
but time and resources, at any given moment, are not infinite.
Under this vision, environmental values are viewed as part of
an array of wants people hold. This vision also appreciates the
importance of decentralized information - information of time,
place and experience - and recognizes that marketplace institutions
(clearly defined rights, competition and market prices) help foster
incentives for stewardship and efficient resource use. But this
vision also recognizes that all environmental problems are not
alike. Some problems are amenable to some form of &quot;privatized&quot;
solution; others require collective - though not necessarily government
- action.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="reform"></a><B>Principles of Reform<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
How might the vision outlined here reshape U.S. environmental
policy? The &quot;vision thing&quot; in itself is not enough to
provide direction to an environmental reform agenda. From that
vision, reformers need to outline some simple policy principles.
Five policy principles are consistent with the vision outlined
here. <BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Decentralization</I>. For three decades, we have
thrust many environmental decisions into the Federal arena. But
for some problems, impacts are strictly local and narrowly circumscribed.
Other environmental problems may impose regional, or even global
impacts. The locus of impact of a problem should help determine
where decision-making authority ought to reside.<BR>

<P>
If most knowledge relevant to understanding specific environmental
problems is location-specific and dynamic, decisions about &quot;how
clean is clean&quot; and what remedies to use should take place
closest to where the problem occurs. For air-emission problems,
that might mean a local air basin. For decisions about cleaning
up an industrial site, that might mean creating processes that
foster bargaining between landowners adjacent to the site and
the site owner. <BR>

<P>
Decentralized bargaining approaches bring to bear relevant local
information. These approaches may also be less likely to drive
decisions toward &quot;zero risk&quot; than centralized decision
processes. In decentralized bargaining situations, citizens face
<I>both</I> the risks associated with a facility and enjoy directly
the benefits - in the form of lower clean-up costs and more job-creation,
for example - associated with a particular remedy. Bargaining
thus serves as a discovery process, revealing more accurate information
about risks and benefits.<BR>

<P>
Unbounded fears may, in fact, be more likely to drive decisions
toward &quot;zero risk&quot; in centralized decision processes.
There, the costs of decisions are spread over an entire population,
but benefits from pursuing pristine clean-ups are enjoyed by those
few near a particular site. The few then have an incentive to
lobby for those benefits, while the many have little incentive
to lobby at all - with obvious results.<BR>

<P>
The contrast between costly Superfund site clean-ups, which have
occurred in a top-down, regulatory framework directed by the EPA,
and more recent local remediation of abandoned industrial sites
through negotiated settlements offers testament to this point.
The locally negotiated clean-ups have, in general, been accomplished
at a fraction of the cost for Superfund sites.<BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Flexibility</I>. Complexity and change characterize
nature and human interaction with it. Traditional regulations
that prescribe technologies or mandate particular clean-up remedies
ignore location-specific and ever-changing information critical
to all production and consumption decisions. To take advantage
of the knowledge residing within a particular plant, or at a specific
hazardous waste site, or on an individual farm, environmental
policies need to foster flexibility, often through the market
process. Performance standards, in contrast to command-and-control
regulations, allow individuals and firms to figure out how best
to achieve the stated standards (to lower overall air pollution
to a certain level, for instance).<BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Problem-solving</I>. The old environmental vision
tended to cast business against environmentalists, the private-sector
against the public sector, regulators against the regulated. The
result was an emphasis on crimes and punishment. According to
EPA Administrator Carol Browner, in fiscal year 1994 the EPA collected
$165.2 million in monetary penalties and $747.5 million in injunctive
relief. The agency pursued 2,246 enforcement actions in a single
year - and these efforts do not include state and local government
enforcement activities.<BR>

<P>
Enforcement efforts, per se, are not unwarranted. But an emphasis
on enforcement that leads to prosecutions of sometimes trivial
procedural violations is costly - and such efforts may inhibit
rather than foster actual environmental improvements. An emphasis
on criminal enforcement even when there is no intent to violate
the law or no gross negligence simply expends scarce dollars on
prosecutions rather than problem-solving.<BR>

<P>
A reform agenda needs to foster information exchanges and technology
development, and bolster incentives of individuals - acting alone
and within public and private institutions - to find ways of mitigating
environmental problems.<BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Balancing.</I> Enhancing quality-of-life requires
optimizing among the many values that people hold. All production
and consumption activities produce residuals. For every residual
generated, some corresponding benefit (from the perspective of
individual consumers) is produced. And all production and consumption
activities involve a series of trade-offs. A dollar spent on pollution
prevention technologies or clean-up is a dollar not available
to invest in other productivity-enhancing endeavors.<BR>

<P>
Trade-offs are not merely between environmental and economic goals.
Many trade-offs are between one set of risks and other risks.
For example, pesticide run-off may contaminate waters, but pesticides
help reduce food spoilage in the field. And less food spoilage
means less food needs to be planted to meet the same consumption
requirements. <BR>

<P>
The September 1995 issue of <I>Risk in Perspective</I>, published
by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, reported that &quot;chlorination
of drinking water is considered one of the most dramatic success
stories in the field of public health.&quot; Chlorination has
helped prevent a whole range of waterborne diseases from chronic
diarrhea to typhoid fever. On the other hand, the Harvard newsletter
cautions that &quot;chlorination is not free of counterveiling
risks....the possibility that these compounds could cause long-term,
chronic effects, including cancer, is now a subject of intensive
research by toxicologists and epidemiologists.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Balancing these risks is not a trivial matter. In Peru, a decision
to reduce the chlorination of public drinking water may have been
responsible for an outbreak of cholera that killed thousands of
people.<BR>

<P>
This problem of trade-offs - and how to get the biggest bang for
the environmental buck - lay at the heart of 1995 Congressional
proposals to institute cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment.
Reform proposals need to incorporate &quot;balancing mechanisms&quot;
- decision processes that foster a balancing of costs against
benefits and establish means for setting priorities. But balancing
may be better achieved through bargaining processes than through
top-down rules that impose detailed analytical requirements on
regulators. <BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Accountability and Stewardship</I>. Economists
Richard Stroup and John Baden conclude that institutions, not
perverse people, are the genesis of environmental problems. Policies
that more closely link the choices that individuals make with
outcomes for those choices strengthen incentives for stewardship
and efficiency. Paying to use resources, for example, establishes
incentives to conserve the same resources.<BR>

<P>
But this linkage applies to public decisions as well. Current
policies that require individuals or firms to set aside land for
wildlife, wilderness and wetlands protection in effect ask these
people to provide a public amenity at no cost to the public. Compensating
private individuals (or firms) in those instances in which they
are asked to provide a public amenity is not merely a matter of
fairness. It also gives property owners a financial self-interest
in protecting habitat and preserving endangered species. And it
gives regulators an incentive to prioritize their efforts.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="do"></a><B>What Can Policymakers Do</B>?<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
An environmental vision must precede policy reform because it
shapes the principles of progress. It provides a basis for developing
principles against which to construct and evaluate different policy
reform tools. It establishes some notion of what reformers value,
and it offers, as Walter Lippman wrote in his 1965 book, <B>Public
Opinion</B>, a &quot;map of the universe&quot; - a sense of the
nature of knowledge and how people create and tap into relevant
knowledge to make decisions.<BR>

<P>
But a vision, and the principles that flow from that vision, are
necessarily abstract. Policy reformers, however, must deal in
specifics. What might an agenda for reform look like?<BR>

<P>
Former EPA chief William Ruckelshaus correctly concluded in his
fall 1995 speech at the Environmental Law Institute's annual awards
dinner in Washington, D.C. that, &quot;despite the current rhetoric
in this city, there is no simple fix, no silver bullet.&quot;
Aligning environmental policies with a new vision that highlights
problem-solving rather than punishment, dynamic use of decentralized
information, and a balancing among many values will require an
overhaul of many current statutes. And it will need to be an evolutionary
process. Three kinds of statutes might start that process.<BR>

<P>
<I>Environmental Devolution Statute</I>. The first step would
include passage of a general statute to devolve responsibilities
and authority for many environmental programs to states. Several
ideas for such a statute have been outlined by the Washington,
D.C.-based National Environmental Policy Institute and other groups.
These ideas serve as a useful starting point. An Environmental
Devolution Statute, focused on most air, water and hazardous waste
regulations, should:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Devolve to the states authority, responsibility and accountability
for setting environmental goals, implementing policy and monitoring
success. Where airsheds or watersheds cross state boundaries,
states would have primary authority for working out acceptable
standards, and the national role would be one of mediator. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Create sunset provisions to phase out existing legislation
<I>as revised environmental laws</I> are introduced. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Create a performance-based system in which the emphasis is
on setting ambient environmental standards, not on the use of
specific technologies. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Establish mechanisms for development of multi-media, facility-wide,
or even community-wide, ambient standards and permitting that
would allow for emission trading among facilities, among different
emission sources within a single plant and even possibly among
different pollution sources. Permits could take the form of contracts
or covenants rather than the more traditional regulatory permits.

</UL>

<P>
The primary purpose of such a statute would be to create procedures
for decentralizing decision-making and developing flexible conditions
in which success is measured by real-world accomplishments, not
by prospective EPA approvals based on modeled predictions of how
EPA thinks different technologies and programs might affect environmental
quality.<BR>

<P>
<I>Civic Environmentalism Act</I>. The second step for environmental
reform would include a Civic Environmentalism Act passed by Congress.
Designed to shift emphasis away from primarily punitive approaches
to policies that promote problem-solving, bargaining and technical
information and information exchange, this act would:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Reform environmental enforcement by clarifying which actions
are subject to criminal penalties and which are subject to civil
and administrative proceedings; tie criminal penalties primarily
to situations in which intent to harm is present; revise sentencing
guidelines so that environmental sentences conform more closely
with guidelines for other, comparable crimes; and, limit dual
prosecutions for the same violation by different agencies. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Create an environmental extension program patterned after
agricultural extension programs in which information and technical
assistance are provided to farmers and businesses to achieve emission
reductions as a substitute for enforcement actions in situations
where neither &quot;intent to harm&quot; nor &quot;gross negligence&quot;
exists. Such programs need not require new expenditures but could
involve a shifting of current expenditures away from punitive
approaches, or they could use proceeds from pollution charges,
or such programs could use private funding. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Facilitate the establishment of local, market-like bargaining
and negotiating processes through which those directly affected
by particular pollution and other environmental harms can negotiate
with the individuals, firms or governments responsible for those
harms concerning appropriate clean-up levels and ambient standards.
Models for these programs already exist within some states, for
some kinds of projects. 
</UL>

<P>
A Civic Environmentalism Act would represent a major departure
from the regulatory approaches established over the past thirty
years. The goal of such an act would be to begin the process of
&quot;privatizing&quot; decision-making regarding some environmental
problems, and creating bargaining approaches for problems such
as Superfund site clean-ups, brownfields redevelopment, Federal
facilities clean-ups, toxic emission standard-setting and other
problems with primarily local impacts.<BR>

<P>
<I>Environmental Amenities Act</I>. The third step in environmental
reform would be an Environmental Amenities Act patterned in part
after the 1995 House proposals for takings compensation to property
owners who lose some (or all) use of their property to provide
public environmental amenities such as wilderness, wildlife and
wetlands protection. The overall purpose of an Environmental Amenities
Act would be to replace the regulatory and punitive approaches
of the current Endangered Species Act and wetlands regulations
developed under the Clean Water Act with market approaches that
create incentives for environmental stewardship and relieve individual
property owners or firms from shouldering the burdens of providing
public amenities at private rather than taxpayer expense. An Environmental
Amenities Act would:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Create requirements for takings compensation in situations
where private landowners are required to provide public amenities;
such provisions <I>do not</I> include compensation against regulations
regarding pollution reduction or mitigation. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Empower states to &quot;privatize&quot; benefits of wildlife
and habitat protection by encouraging use of bounties, competitive
contracts for private entities to provide habitat and wildlife
protection, and other measures that allow private individuals,
firms, ranchers and forest owners to &quot;capture value&quot;
by producing environmental goods. 
</UL>

<P>
The purpose of an Environmental Amenities Act would be to strengthen
accountability - both in the private and public sectors.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="better"></a><B>A Better Future<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
All environmental decisions involve a tug-of-war among competing
values. This includes a tug-of-war among substantive values -
my sphere of values versus my neighbor's and one value versus
another.<BR>

<P>
The tug-of-war also includes juggling among what I call decision-process
values. All decision-making processes experience, to varying degrees
along a continuum, a tension between predictability and flexibility;
uniformity and diversity; certainty and dynamism; anticipation
of all harms and resilience - the ability to respond effectively
when problems arise.<BR>

<P>
For thirty years, however, legislators have opted for environmental
policies that have emphasized predictability, centralization,
certainty and uniformity. These decision characteristics are ill-suited
to a dynamic world in which people hold diverse values and problems
are complex and often location-specific. Such a world requires
decision processes that enhance autonomy, personal stewardship,
flexibility, decentralization, adaptation and resilience.

<title>No More Home Alone - Policy Review - Mar-Apr 96 - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h2>No More Home Alone</h2>

<b>Essays by James Q. Wilson & Kathleen Sylvester call for an end to money for teen moms to live on their own</b>
<p> <b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
March-April 1996, Number 76</i><hr width=50%></center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sociologist James Q. Wilson proposes that unmarried, pregnant girls live in some type of supervised, privately run group home as a condition of receiving government benefits. This, he argues, would help provide the social structure that young single mothers and their children now lack, but desperately need if they are to escape the cycle of dependence. <a href="#syl">Kathleen Sylvester</a> of the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org/">Progressive Policy Institute</a> describes a version of this concept that was approved by Congress last fall as part of its welfare reform package. President Clinton vetoed the bill.<p><h3>James Q. Wilson<br><i>Beginning with Our Children</I></h3><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The American political regime as envisioned by its founders was not supposed to have anything to do with character. It was supposed to enable people living in villages and towns to compose their differences at the national level in order to secure a more perfect union and ensure domestic tranquillity and justice. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It was assumed that it was in private associations (family, neighborhood, and peer groups) and small political institutions (village and town governments) that character could be formed, so the national government could take character for granted. "Men," Madison wrote, "are presumed to have sufficient virtue to constitute and maintain a free republic." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Today, by contrast, we are properly concerned with the issue of character, placed on the national agenda by both political parties. Why is it that the assumptions that influenced the men who gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 are no longer the assumptions we bring to the contemplation of the true purpose of our national polity?<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One reason is that government has gotten bigger. As government gets bigger, it touches all aspects of our lives. As it touches all aspects of our lives, we increasingly put our concerns back on the government. The price of big government is an ever-expanding agenda. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Forty years ago, when I began studying politics, it was inconceivable that the federal government would ever be held responsible for crime, drug abuse, illegitimacy, welfare, civil rights, clean air, or clean water. Today it is responsible for all those things. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not only have our aspirations and the size of the federal government changed, but so has our culture. In many spheres of our lives, we are no longer confident that local private institutions like families, churches, and neighborhoods are sufficient to form a culture that will sustain and enrich a free society. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One of the areas in which this concern has become most sharply focused is illegitimacy. An illegitimacy crisis that affects both blacks and whites has been growing without let up since the early 1960s. It has shaped the profound debate now unfolding in Washington about the relationship between federal welfare programs and the very formation and maintenance of families. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When Title IV, which created the program now known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), was added to the Social Security Act of 1935, it was the least controversial part of that landmark legislation. For years after its enactment, it caused scarcely a national political ripple. The reason was that it gave federal support to a few state programs designed to provide short-term compensation to women who had been widowed due to the First World War or coal-mining disasters, or who had been divorced or deserted by husbands. It nationalized these programs by extending them to the other states. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one expected it would become a way of life and no one ever expected teenagers would apply for it. All that has changed. Today, the typical new AFDC enrollee spends only two or three years on welfare and then moves on. It acts as a stopgap measure to provide for the needs of women and children during a particularly difficult time in their lives. This is the group for whom AFDC was originally intended. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But if you look at the total number of welfare recipients, as opposed to those who enter the roles in any given year, you notice that the typical recipient has been on welfare for 10 years. Increasingly, this has extended into second and third generations. Many come and leave quickly, but a few remain. And the number who remain now constitute the largest share of the whole. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There is a spirited debate about why this should be so. I think it is fair to say that no one can confidently claim to know the answer to this question. It is difficult to sustain the argument that the existence of welfare causes dependency if it did not do so during the first 30 years of its history. Evidence about the effect of state differences in welfare payments on rates of welfare participation is inconclusive. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There has probably been a profound cultural shift that has destigmatized illegitimacy and removed barriers that once inhibited people from remaining on AFDC for long periods of time. Even if we assume that the system of public payments did not cause this phenomenon, it certainly makes it possible. If the system did not exist, the current degree of dependency would not exist.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even if you disagree with that assertion, the system has surely not cured its own defects. Rates of illegitimacy and single parenthood among black and white Americans have risen steadily since the early 1960s and that trend shows little sign of tapering off. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The harms associated with single parenthood and illegitimacy are now so well documented that the evidence need not be reviewed. But let me give you one example gathered by the government itself. A few years ago, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services selected more than 30,000 households across the country, designed to represent a statistical cross section. They interviewed the mother, father, or both about the welfare of their children. Except for the very highest income level, children raised in single-parent households are materially worse off, irrespective of race. They are worse off in terms of educational achievement, social well-being, aggressiveness, and difficulty with the law. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It should not take massive studies to establish this phenomenon. It is evident to many who confront life in hospital emergency rooms, police stations, juvenile courts, or welfare offices on a daily basis. The problem has crystallized in our concern about the unmarried teenage mother. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If you survey the history of families around the world, every culture has had teenage mothers. Indeed, what is striking today is how long many women wait before having children. But what was different in the past is that those girls gave birth as part of an embedded structure: with a husband, parents, grandmothers, aunts, uncles, and siblings. They were part of an extended family or a village in which there were many people who not only helped take care of the child, but taught the mother to be a mother and required that the father be a father. The debate I hear in Washington about reforming the current system is remarkably inattentive to the core fact that young girls living apart from other adults cannot expect much success at raising children alone. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead, the debate is posing questions such as: How do we save money on the welfare budget? How soon can we require recipients to work? How can we use modern technology to go after deadbeat dads? These may all be worthwhile concerns, but they should be viewed as subordinate to the central goal of saving the children whose lives are being destroyed as a consequence of growing up in this environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To solve this problem, we must ask all levels of government and the private sector to do something American government has never had to do before: constitute and support a viable alternative to the traditional family for the children and young women most at risk. One trembles even to utter the phrase "viable alternative," because in the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition, the king with all his legions stops at the threshold of the hut of the very poorest peasant. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We all understand that government cannot raise children. But there is something out there that is not working and government must change its allocation of incentives to give us a fighting chance of solving the problem. Let me suggest a strategy and then indicate how it might be implemented. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We must get young, unmarried, pregnant girls embedded in a social structure under adult supervision. This not only provides their children with a chance for a good start in life, but teaches them how to be a parent and protect themselves from the desperate conditions of gangs, drugs, and crime that often exist around them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I therefore propose that if young, unmarried, pregnant women wish to establish an independent household at public expense, they should be given this support only on the condition that they live in some kind of family shelter or group home managed under private auspices, including religious groups. Part of the welfare reform debate currently raging in Washington focuses on the so-called Ashcroft Amendment, sponsored by Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The amendment states that nothing in the proposed welfare reform bill shall prevent religious groups from providing social services to welfare recipients on an equal basis with secular groups. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is not clear what is meant by "services," or how funds would be transferred to these groups. But it is sending the message to young women that the character of the children they are raising is so important to this society that we insist they raise them in a truly adult setting provided by one of a variety of private organizations. And we will reinforce this by saying that your check cannot be cashed unless it is cosigned by the person who manages the program. You are free to choose the program -- secular or religious -- you wish to join. But we will not fund you to set up an independent household, given what we know about the harm it does to the children. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Up to this point I have said nothing about the other half of the equation -- the men involved. The riskiest policy for a male observer is to act as if this were a problem created by women that could be solved by placing more constraints on women. But let me clarify a few points from the perspective of someone who has been researching the history of families and fatherhood around the world. Men and women differ in their willingness to make a commitment to the welfare of a child. This can be established by the simple fact that in any culture where there are single-parent families, more than 90 percent of them are headed by women. This cannot happen by accident. If it were simply a matter of cultural convention, you would find places where half or more of single parent families were headed by men. But you do not. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Men and women differ due to evolution, biology, and a variety of other factors. But since women care for children when men will not, much of civilization has been devoted to the problem of disciplining males. Society in all cultures has invented a few techniques to get males to play their role. When I was growing up, young unmarried women who got pregnant had a couple of choices. They either went away to live with relatives, had the child, then returned while the relatives raised the child, or they told their fathers and brothers the identity of the father of the child. The father and brothers then told the boy, "Either you marry the girl or we will beat you to death." The other option for the boy was to run away and join the Navy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; None of those options seems to work anymore. The force of custom and shame is no longer as powerful as it once was. The law once played a role in forcing men to take responsibility by requiring that paternity be clarified. Women once played a role by denying sexual access to men unwilling to make a commitment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If you want to summarize in hyperbolic terms what the core problem of character formation is today, it is that the only one of these forces that still operates is the woman's willingness to say "no." In place of law, we have no-fault divorce. In place of custom and shame, we have created a sense that everyone should "do his own thing." And fathers and brothers, far from beating up someone who has impregnated a daughter without marrying her, are themselves busy with other people's daughters. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, this leaves the burden on women. But women should not bear the burden alone; the state should be on their side. To the extent it can, it is desirable for the state to enforce the obligations of paternity. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This has proven to be extremely difficult. For several years, particularly since Congress passed the Family Support Act in 1988, programs have been in place to get states to devise ways of collecting child-support payments from absent fathers. Many states have vigorously pursued the fathers, but have not collected much money. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But again we are moving away from the core problem. The key is not to supply dollars, but to supply the father. It is his presence, not just his money, that has been lost. The average child raised by a mother only sees his father a few times a year. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The problem of reconstituting this character-forming institution cannot be solved by government. But I would suggest that just as we have formed and are encouraging charter schools, we should form and encourage "charter families" --  private-sector groups that are willing to accept government money to provide long-term shelters for young girls who cannot or will not live with their own parents and who have children with no fathers to take care of them. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I have no idea whether this will work. But we must encourage this type of experimentation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Money is going to flow from Washington to the states in the form of block grants. With some degree of restriction, states will have the opportunity to design and implement their own welfare programs. Most states will reproduce less expensive forms of the current system. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But I hope the states will use this opportunity to tear up the old script. Leave the existing system intact for women who need it as a bridge to get through death, desertion, or divorce, and will leave welfare in two or three years. But provide a radically different option, privately run and with a built-in social structure, for those young girls who are now raising the next generation of our children. <P><I><b>James Q.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1863, President Lincoln signed a charter establishing a home for orphans and "unprotected females" --  as unwed mothers were then known -- just a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Last September, during the Senate's contentious welfare-reform debate, there was a rare moment of bipartisan agreement as Senate Democrats were joined by Mr. Lincoln's party in nearly unanimous support of a similar institution: the "second-chance home." In an amendment later adopted by the House of Representatives, the U.S. Congress went on record in support of reviving an old institution -- the maternity home -- in a new form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Second-Chance Home amendment, offered by Democratic Senators Kent Conrad and Joseph Lieberman, would provide $150 million in seed money for states to support community-based residences for welfare mothers under 18. Young women whose own families are unstable would be required to live under adult supervision in these homes with their children as a condition of receiving welfare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This provision was included in the welfare-reform bill vetoed by President Clinton. But the idea and its principles already are attracting broad support. States and communities are not waiting for federal funding. The "second-chance home" may become a new social institution. And even more importantly, it may offer a model for partnerships between government and communities that restore values to social programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One reason that second-chance homes are becoming popular is that they are practical. They are designed to deal with the realities of teen mothers' lives rather than the stereotype that they are simply promiscuous young women having babies to get welfare checks. Remember, these women have been badly nurtured. Many have been subjected to neglect or physical violence. Studies show that as many as two-thirds were victims of rape or sexual abuse at an early age-crimes often committed by males living in the same household. Many suffer from mental and emotional problems. They are easy prey for older men. The Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that almost two-thirds of teenage mothers' babies are fathered by men who are 20 or older.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the life prospects of teenage mothers are severely limited by their lack of socialization: They raise their children as their parents raised them; they model their social behavior after peers from the same neighborhoods. They have few role models for any other life.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For many of these young women, it will take a new home and a new family -- a second-chance home. Communities as varied as Los Angeles, New Albany, Indiana, and Wheeling, West Virginia, are offering such homes. There are several hundred of them around the country, mostly privately funded. While the homes differ in structure, they all offer three common elements that teen welfare mothers need to change their lives: socialization, nurturing and support, and structure and discipline.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These homes offer a genuine social contract. The young mothers must help with household duties, stay in school or job training, and take good care of their children. They must stay drug free and abide by curfews. They learn to manage money and manage conflicts. In return, they get help with day care and health care and schoolwork. They get protection from violent family members and abusive boyfriends. Most importantly, the teen mothers receive the support of caring adults and lessons in everyday living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The notion that government has a fundamental obligation to help these young mothers is one Democrats have long supported. But the idea these young women owe society a reciprocal obligation is one that some in the party have resisted. The welfare debate signaled a change: Many Democrats are ready to abandon the moral relativism that has characterized liberal social policy. While those on the party's far left still argue for an unfettered right to public support, a growing number of Democrats are willing to impose standards on welfare mothers, sending a powerful message that society no longer offers unconditional financial support for women who bear children out of wedlock. Senator Lieberman, in offering his amendment, called a system that supports the birth of children to young unwed mothers "profoundly troubling" and one that "does not reflect the best values of our country." Many Democrats, it seems, are ready to reassert the importance of values in social policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Republicans have traditionally been more comfortable talking about values, but less willing to acknowledge a basic government role in assuring the welfare of citizens in need. And to be sure, many conservative Republicans -- those who would cut off public aid to teen mothers under 18 -- still take the callous and wrongheaded view that the fundamental goal of welfare reform is to punish illegitimacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But Democrats and Republicans in a number of states -- including Massachusetts, Iowa, Maryland, and California -- are working together to create second-chance homes. If these political leaders are wise, they will continue on their bipartisan path: They will support the Democrats' assertion of a fundamental role for government in social problems, and they will heed the Republicans' insistence on the importance of values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whose values? The values of communities. If second-chance homes are created as real "community-based" institutions, they will begin to remedy one of the unintended consequences of the New Deal. For when government assumed primary responsibility for poor families, communities were relieved of obligations to care for their own citizens, and the notion of social reciprocity disappeared. Government became a wedge between communities and individuals, providing each group excuses to ignore its obligations to the other.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second-chance homes should not be "government-run" or purely government-funded. They should be run by community-based institutions, including churches and non-profit organizations. That is how the most effective homes for teen mothers are now run. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Teen Parent Residence in Albuquerque, New Mexico, offers an example. The program, based in a cluster of low-income apartment units subsidized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, costs the state just $67,500 for services to 14 teen mothers and their children for one year. The young mothers, who are enrolled in the federal Job Corps, use their welfare checks to pay below-market rent for the apartments they share. The state pays for an apartment in the cluster for the resident "house mother," for a night-duty nurse, and for some professional counseling services. Virtually everything else comes from the community.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The local health clinic teaches the young mothers about child development. The Agricultural Extension service teaches nutrition classes. Local youth groups offer baby-sitting services. Albuquerque's Hispano Chamber of Commerce not only donates money to the program, it hires the program's graduates. Families from local churches take the mothers and children home for Sunday dinner-and sometimes to Sunday services as well. The young women and children who live in the Teen Parent Residence have become part of the community. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is possible, of course, to spend much more money on residential facilities for young mothers. In New York state, group homes staffed and run entirely by professionals cost more than $50,000 a year per mother and child. While this approach guarantees uniform standards, it also guarantees that the young mothers will live in isolation from their communities. These expensive, bureaucratic institutions reinforce the old paternalistic notion of the left that government can invent a program to solve every problem. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Second-Chance Home legislation takes an important step away from bureaucratic rigidity by specifying that beneficiaries of federal programs can't be discriminated against if they live in these group homes. This means, for example, that young mothers won't lose their food-stamp benefits if they cook and eat together -- something current food-stamp regulations prohibit. In practical terms, it means that a small community-based organization that wants to help four or five teen mothers won't have to apply for federal waivers so young women can keep their food-stamp income and use it to buy groceries for the home. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now as welfare decisions shift to state policymakers, they, too, must resist urges to overregulate and micromanange. Governors and legislators deciding how to set policies for second-chance homes should use these principles for guidelines:
<p><ul><li>	Funding should be used as Congress intended -- as seed money. It should go only to communities that pledge broad community involvement and a match of in-kind services.<p>
<li>	Churches and other religiously affiliated institutions have a long history of service to families; these organizations should be eligible for public funding to continue providing services.<p>
<li>	Evaluate them on what they accomplish. Judge the homes by the number of mothers who don't get pregnant a second time, the number who finish school, and the number who get off welfare. This would allow providers to help teen mothers by whatever means work. <p>
<li>	Government's monopoly over social policy is quickly eroding. In response to this change, government must offer communities a new "bargain." Government must catalyze and support the efforts of communities. At the same time, government policy should be consistent with a declaration by our nation's civic, moral, and community leaders that it is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and men to make babies they cannot support. In this way, government can help reestablish the importance of values -- those of communities and families -- in social policy. That is the best way to define a social agenda for the next century.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;St. Ann's, the institution that Lincoln chartered, still operates today just outside of Washington, D.C. And though the lives of its residents are vastly different from its first beneficiaries, they still meet Lincoln's definition of "unprotected females." They are still young women who need society's support to make decent lives for their children. Politicians of both parties who revere Lincoln should heed his wisdom.<p><I><b>Kathleen Sylvester</b> is the vice president for domestic policy at the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org/">Progressive Policy Institute</a>.</I>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Just weeks after telling the nation, in this year's State of the Union address, that the "era of big government is over," Bill Clinton indicated that the obituary notice was somewhat premature when he delivered his a 20-page FY 1997 budget to Congress. In contrast to the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 (BBA), which he vetoed last fall, the latest Clinton budget would mean $1,927 in higher taxes and $3,155 in higher spending for every household in America over the next seven years. This is the eighth budget plan Clinton has delivered to Congress in a year; and, except for the FY 1996 budget submitted last February (which called for $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade), each has been short on specifics and long on promises.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While Clinton claims his FY 1997 budget will eliminate the federal deficit by FY 2002 using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, it does so only by using the same assortment of smoke, mirrors, and other gimmicks that has made taxpayers increasingly cynical about Washington's commitment to budget-making. Even worse, although the Clinton budget balances on paper, it flinches from making the tough decisions needed to eliminate wasteful and outmoded programs, end welfare as we know it, save Medicare from bankruptcy, or transfer failing federal programs to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The FY 1997 Clinton budget is not the end of big government, it is the embodiment of it. Clinton's plan, for example:
<ul>
<li>Increases federal spending by $361 billion over the next seven years and hikes tax revenues by $526 billion;
<p>
<li>Spends a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, or $306 billion more than the vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995. That means $3,155 more for every household in America;
<p>
<li>Raises a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues over seven years, $187 billion more than the BBA, and $1,927 more in taxes for every household in America;
<p>
<li>Allows $119 billion more deficit spending through 2002 than the BBA, which is equivalent to passing along $1,227 per household in debt to the next generation of American workers;
<p>
<li>Fails to eliminate a single program of any significance;
<p>
<li>Fails to eliminate even one Cabinet-level agency;
<p>
<li>Increases entitlement spending by $365 billion over the next seven years while failing to save Medicare from bankruptcy, end welfare as we know it, or protect states from the exploding costs of Medicaid; and
<p>
<li>Spends $111 billion more on discretionary programs than the BBA while calling for billions more in spending on programs that have failed or become obsolete, that duplicate others, or that should be transferred to state and local government control.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The FY 1997 Clinton budget signals not the end of big government, but the continuation of status-quo government.
<p>

<b>CLINTON 8, TAXPAYERS 0</b><sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite a campaign promise to balance the budget in five years while providing tax cuts for working families, President Clinton has consistently resisted congressional efforts to enact a balanced budget plan with tax cuts. In addition to vetoing the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Clinton presented four budget plans to Congress during 1995 -- each time falling far short of balancing the budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office. After a year of prodding, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan on January 5, 1996. CBO certified -- at least on paper -- that this new proposal would balance the budget by 2002. Closer review of each of the budget plans proposed by Clinton during the past year, however, including the FY 1997 budget, shows that the White House has never been serious about either balancing the budget or providing meaningful tax relief. It seems interested only in finding ways to spend more taxpayer dollars while appearing to agree that the budget should be balanced.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #1</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade. According to CBO, the President's February budget would increase the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The February Clinton budget did propose a few modest privatization initiatives, such as selling the Power Marketing Administrations, portions of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, the Naval Petroleum Reserves, and portions of the National Weather Service. It also proposed terminating a few small programs and consolidating some 270 programs into 27 new programs. In addition, the budget proposed a "Middle Class Bill of Rights" which included a modest $300-per-child tax credit for families that have children below age 13 and who earn less than $60,000 per year. But the Administration did little to fight for any of these proposals. On May 19, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This Clinton plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than his first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, this plan would produce $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second budget plan also included the modest tax cut for families with children in addition to tax deductions for higher education and expanded Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never balance the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform than the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<P>
<b>Clinton Budget #4</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The CBO scored this plan as $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up for its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In other words, the Administration wanted to have it both ways: Claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 18, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #5</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan to Congress. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is likely that Clinton never would have submitted this plan had it not been for the conditions Congress included in the continuing resolution passed on January 5, 1996. These conditions stipulated, in effect, that a bill to provide operating funds for unappropriated federal programs through January 26 would not be sent to the President until he submitted a seven-year balanced budget plan scored by the CBO. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, the fifth Clinton budget falls far short of being credible. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the fifth Clinton budget, most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction fell in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings was to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were "sunsetted" in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget would be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal is reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The sixth Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 9. It moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while boosting the net size of the tax cuts to $85 billion. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings than the last congressional offer and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs. 
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would be reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would force hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Moreover, each plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>
<b>WHAT CLINTON'S FY 1997 BUDGET WOULD MEAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The eight Clinton budgets clearly demonstrate that this President envisions a government that has a balanced budget but somehow remains largely unchanged from government with perpetual $200 billion deficits. In other words, Clinton wants it both ways. He says he wants a balanced federal budget, but he is not willing to challenge the size and scope of government as a credible balanced budget plan requires.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The boldest proposal the Administration can muster is to "reinvent government," which, in practice, amounts to putting a new paint job on a house whose foundation is collapsing under its own weight. American taxpayers sent government a very clear message in the 1994 election: They do not want useless and obsolete programs merely to waste their money more efficiently. They want the budget to be balanced in a timely fashion, and they want the result of this effort to be a smaller, less costly government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton FY 1997 budget would leave less money in the pockets of working families and more money in the hands Washington's big spenders.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It spends money taxpayers cannot afford. The 20-page FY 1997 Clinton budget proposes to "balance the budget" in FY 2002 while boosting spending $361 billion over the next seven years. It would spend a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, $306 billion more than would be spent under the Balanced Budget Act the President vetoed last December. This amounts to $3,155 more government spending for every household in America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It takes more of their money in tax revenues. The Clinton budget assumes federal tax collections will grow an astonishing $526 billion by FY 2002, a jump of nearly 39 percent. Also, the Administration expects the government to collect a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues over the next seven years, $187 billion more than under the BBA. This amounts to $1,927 more in taxes for every household in America. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It adds to tomorrow's debt burden. Because the Clinton budget fails to control federal spending, it would add $755 billion in accumulated deficits to the national debt, even while promising to balance the budget over seven years. Compared to the BBA, this is $119 billion more deficit spending over seven years, equivalent to transferring $1,227 per household in added debt to the next generation of American workers.
<p>

<b>Balancing the Budget Without Lifting a Finger</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As was the case with Clinton's previous "balanced budget" plans, the only way the FY 1997 budget can be made to balance -- at least on paper -- is by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future President and Congress. How does it do this?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>First, the Clinton plan purports to save nearly $596 billion over the next seven years, but less than 40 percent of these savings is achieved during the first five years.</b> The painful task of accomplishing 61 percent of the plan's deficit reduction falls to the first Congress and President elected in the next century. Indeed, some 54 percent of the plan's Medicare savings and 60 percent of its Medicaid savings will fall beyond a possible second Clinton term in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Second, while Clinton claims his budget balances according to Congressional Budget Office assumptions, it does not. Clinton makes his job of balancing the budget in FY 2002 easier by challenging or ignoring CBO assumptions</b>.<sup>2</sup>  For instance, CBO currently projects a $228 billion deficit in FY 2002. Clinton, however, reduces that projection to $221 billion by challenging one of CBO's technical assumptions, thereby avoiding the need to cut $7 billion in spending. Also, Clinton's budget uses Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates of proposed spectrum auction proceeds, rather than CBO estimates, to produce an additional $11 billion in deficit reduction in FY 2002 -- again, to avoid having to produce real spending cuts. The Senate Budget Committee reports that if honest accounting methods were used, Clinton's budget would produce a $9 billion deficit in FY 2002, not the balance the Administration claims.
<p>
<b>Modest Tax Cuts, More Tax Increases</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton budget also manipulates its proposed tax cuts in order to avoid having to make tough choices on curbing spending. The budget proposes a meager $98.5 billion in gross tax cuts over seven years, equivalent to returning just 8 cents of every $1,000 in taxes the government expects to collect. The centerpiece of the plan is a tax credit for dependent children that begins at $300 per child and increases to $500 per child in 1999.<sup>3</sup> However, Clinton "sunsets" the child credit after FY 2001, increasing taxes on these families by over $17 billion in 2002 -- the year Clinton promises to balance the budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton budget proposes to generate $59.4 billion in new tax revenues by "cutting corporate tax subsidies, closing loopholes, and improving tax compliance."<sup>4</sup> This amount exceeds the Administration's proposed seven-year savings in Medicaid ($59 billion) and is nearly 50 percent greater than its proposed welfare cuts ($40 billion). These new revenues effectively reduce the net size of the tax cut package to $39 billion, equal to a cut of just 3 cents for every $1,000 taxpayers will send Washington over the next seven years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One of the major contributing factors in the Clinton budget's ability to "balance" the budget in FY 2002 is the temporary nature of the tax cuts combined with the permanent nature of the new tax revenues. The new tax measures purportedly generate $11.9 billion in FY 2002. When this amount is added to the $17 billion tax hike on families resulting from the unseating of the child tax credit, the result is $29 billion in deficit reduction, roughly 15 percent of Clinton's total deficit savings in FY 2002. Again, there is no need to make tough choices on real spending cuts.
<p>

<b>The Failure to Address Exploding Entitlement Growth</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regrettably, Clinton proposes no credible solutions to the serious problems facing the nation's major entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare. The meager savings the Administration proposes to achieve from these programs fall far short of stemming the tide of red ink in the near term -- and far short of the fundamental changes needed to keep these programs from collapsing. The White House has been warned repeatedly of the need to curb runaway entitlements:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;CBO projects that, if nothing is done to slow the overall growth of entitlement programs, they will grow by $465 billion over the next seven years, a 63 percent increase. Worse yet, CBO expects entitlements to consume 57 cents of every dollar spent by the federal government in 2002 -- over 8 cents more than is spent today.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The long-term forecasts reported by the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, headed by Senators Robert Kerry (D-NE) and John Danforth (R-MO, now retired), are even more troubling. These projections suggest that entitlements will become a liability that cannot be sustained by the federal government, by the economy, or by the taxpayers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some examples of the Commission's findings:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Example:</b> "The gap between Federal spending and revenues is growing rapidly. Absent policy changes, entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will consume almost all Federal revenues in 2010. In 2030, Federal revenues will not even cover entitlement spending."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> "By 2030, unless appropriate policy changes are made in the interim, projected spending for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Federal employee retirement programs alone will consume all tax revenues.... If all other Federal programs (except interest on the national debt) grow no faster than the economy, total Federal outlays would exceed 37 percent of the economy. Today, outlays are 22 percent of the economy.... "<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> "The share of Medicare Part B cost paid by enrollees as monthly premiums has been shrinking since the program began. When the program started, the enrollee and the Federal government had a 50-50 partnership -- each paid 50 percent of the cost. Today, the Federal government pays 70 percent of Part B costs; by 2030 the government's share is projected to increase to 92 percent."<sup>7</sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Entitlements grow as a share of budget. </b>Under the proposed FY 1997 Clinton budget, overall entitlement spending would increase by $365 billion (nearly 50 percent) over the next seven years. While the Clinton plan would slow the aggregate growth rate of these programs to an average of roughly 6 percent per year from a CBO-projected average of 7.2 percent per year, entitlement programs will increase substantially as a share of the overall federal budget. Currently, mandatory programs consume 48.7 cents of every dollar spent by the federal government. The Clinton budget plan would increase the share of federal spending dedicated to these programs to 58.8 cents of every federal dollar by FY 2002.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One reason is Clinton's failure to address significantly the systemic problems within these programs. The other reason is that Clinton's budget plan achieves more than 55 percent of its overall deficit savings from discretionary programs -- which comprise just 36 percent of federal spending. As these annually appropriated programs shrink as a share of total spending, a greater share of the federal budget is consumed by "uncontrolled" entitlement spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Medicare is left at risk.</b> In April 1995, the Medicare Trustees issued a warning that the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund was in severe financial imbalance and that Congress should take "timely action to establish long term financial stability for the program."<sup>8</sup> Indeed, recent figures from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) show that in 1995, the HI program paid out $35.7 million more in benefits than it took in through the HI payroll tax, thus forcing HCFA to reduce the trust fund's accrued balance to pay its bills. This is a sign that the HI trust fund, which is expected to go bankrupt by the year 2002, could face a financial crisis even earlier than has been feared.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these warning signs, the Clinton Administration's Medicare reform proposal falls short of restoring the long-term solvency of the program. Even though the President's budget promises to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by $124 billion over the next seven years compared to CBO projections, it provides too few details to justify such claims. The plan purports to allow beneficiaries more choices from the private sector, but it does not replace today's defined benefit program with a defined contribution program that truly gives America's seniors an unprecedented opportunity to choose their own health plan and range of benefits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Furthermore, the President's budget proposal maintains a heavy taxpayer subsidy of Medicare's Part B premiums by requiring beneficiaries to pay only 25 percent of Part B program costs. The original Part B program required beneficiaries to pay premiums which reflected one-half of program costs. Maintaining the taxpayer subsidy at 75 percent means there are not enough incentives to encourage enrollees to compare the costs and benefits of more efficient private alternatives with the costs and benefits of the Part B program. The more the subsidy is reduced, the more level the playing field between private-sector plans and government. The elderly would have incentives to choose more efficient plans in the private sector. The likely result: not just a reduction in the subsidy, but a significant reduction in gross budget outlays for Medicare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>More Medicaid costs are shifted to the states.</b> The Clinton Medicaid reform proposal would exacerbate the crisis facing most state governments: growing Medicaid costs that are siphoning off precious resources from such other priorities such as education, prisons, and infrastructure. Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated that "if no changes are made to current law, the states and the District of Columbia probably will need to raise taxes or cut other spending by $146 billion over seven years in order to meet their mandated obligations."<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton's proposal would control federal Medicaid costs by some $59 billion over seven years by implementing a "per capita cap" on the amount Washington sends to states to provide health care for the poor and elderly. But this purported reform retains Medicaid's existing entitlement structure by maintaining most of the current eligibility requirements in Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Maintaining these federal strings could impose an additional $47.4 billion in Medicaid costs on already financially strapped states.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Limiting federal Medicaid expenditures while increasing the financial exposure of the states is irresponsible. The President's proposal does not allow states the flexibility they need to design benefit packages or other major program parameters. If the federal government is going to cap its Medicaid expenditures, the states must be allowed to establish new benefit packages, provider reimbursement systems, and -- most important -- eligibility criteria. While the Administration's proposal allows for some limited changes in managed care enrollment, it represents a large unfunded mandate to the states because they will not have the freedom to control costs as dictated by the federal per capita caps. The magnitude of an such an unfunded mandate will vary from state to state because of differences in population. However, a large state, such as California, could face additional costs of $4.4 billion from the per capita cap.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Welfare reform ignores the root causes of poverty.</b> The Clinton welfare reform proposal will hardly make a dent in the massive federal welfare system that has cost taxpayers $5.5 trillion since 1965. The federal welfare system is a vast network of 78 interrelated, overlapping, means-tested programs designed to assist poor or low-income Americans. The cost to all levels of government was $350 billion in 1994, with Washington contributing 72 percent. This amounts to $3,400 for every taxpaying household in America.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton proposes to trim the welfare state by an unnoticeable $40 billion over the next seven years. Real reform would send programs back to the states with only a few necessary strings attached, but the Clinton plan keeps the existing structure of federal anti-poverty programs and talks vaguely about giving flexibility to the states. Clinton also talks in tough terms about imposing real work requirements on welfare recipients but the reforms drafted by the Administration contain only sham work requirements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The most serious flaw in the Clinton welfare plan is its failure to address one of the major root causes of poverty: illegitimacy. Since 1965, the percentage of children born out of wedlock has grown from 7 percent of all children to 32 percent -- an almost five-fold increase. Rather than deal substantively with this problem, the Clinton plan simply tries to address the symptoms by spending more on job training and child care programs. 
<p>
<b>Spending Initiatives That Outweigh Spending Cuts</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While stating that "government should not do for individuals what they can do for themselves," the Clinton budget outlines a sweeping agenda of spending initiatives in areas such as education, high technology, crime fighting, and the environment. Remarkably, the discussion of this new spending falls under the heading "Spurring Economic Growth," thus confirming the Administration's strange and obsolete notion that directed government spending, not private spending, is the key to creating jobs and economic growth. Nowhere, however, does Clinton's budget provide even a hint of how it intends to achieve the $297 billion in discretionary spending cuts that comprise 55 percent of its deficit reduction plan. These details, presumably, will be outlined in the Administration's full FY 1997 budget, due to be published this month.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton's spending initiatives would add yet another layer of bureaucracy to the hundreds of failed programs currently funded in the federal budget in areas the President claims are priorities. Clinton has an obligation to explain to taxpayers why these hundreds of existing programs have failed, and why they have not been eliminated, before trying to justify pumping even more money into these areas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some of these new spending priorities include:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Job training.</b> The budget proudly states that the Administration has shifted more money into job training programs and would increase funding for Skill Grants for dislocated workers. Yet: 
<p><ul>
<li>The General Accounting Office (GAO) reports that 14 separate federal departments and agencies currently fund some 164 job training programs at a cost to taxpayers of roughly $25 billion per year. Moreover, the few controlled studies that have been conducted show that these programs have little or no success either in putting people to work or in raising their wages.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Education.</b> The Administration claims it has shifted more money to education programs such as Goals 2000 and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program. Now Clinton wants new programs to "connect every classroom to the information super-highway," in addition to expanded work-study for college students, merit scholarships for high school students, and charter schools. Yet: 
<p><ul>
<li>The Department of Education already manages roughly 240 programs, dozens of them targeted to the same students for whom Clinton would create new programs. Indeed, Goals 2000 does little to benefit students; it primarily funds state bureaucracies and duplicates many programs currently operated by the states. Also, many states already are experimenting with reform initiatives such as charter schools and do not need Washington's help. Moreover, there are some 240 programs targeted to "at-risk youth" scattered throughout such agencies as the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Labor. Creating more programs targeted to these young people only adds to the bureaucracy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Science and technology "investments."</b>  The Clinton budget places great emphasis on maintaining Administration's investments in high-technology spending. Yet:
<p><ul>
<li>These myriad "investment" programs have turned out to be little more than expensive corporate welfare. There is evidence to suggest that these programs not only do not create jobs, but actually may induce the recipient corporations to downsize their research and development departments.<sup>11</sup> Many corporations figure there is no reason to fund their own R&D if Washington will pick up the tab for them.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Crime.</b> The Clinton budget "fully funds the President's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) initiative," which the Administration claims will put 100,000 new police officers on the street. Clinton claims this program is responsible for the hiring of 23,000 new policemen to date. Yet:
<p><ul>
<li> The problem with Clinton's promise to put 100,000 new police officers on the street by 2000 is that the math does not work. The 1994 crime bill, which authorized the COPS initiative, provided $8.4 billion in federal funds over six years, enough money either to put only 20,000 permanent new policemen on the street or to pay 100,000 officers less than $15,000 per year. Since police officers make more than the minimum wage, state and local governments that accept these federal funds will have to finance the remaining cost themselves -- a cost that could total $28 billion over six years.<sup>12</sup> Congress would change this program from a matching grant to a simple block grant, allowing local governments to use the funds for other law enforcement-related purposes such as purchasing equipment, paying overtime, and establishing neighborhood programs. Clinton has rejected these reforms, and the reason is obvious: Block granting the funds will not force local governments to pay for Clinton's campaign promises. 
</ul>
<p>

<b>Discretionary Spending "Cuts"</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton FY 1997 budget proposes to spend $111 billion more on discretionary programs than the Balanced Budget Act the President vetoed, while claiming to save $297 billion over seven years from these programs. How can this be true?  The truth is these savings are calculated from the CBO "baseline," which projects higher spending on discretionary programs in future years. Thus, simply freezing aggregate spending on these programs at FY 1995 levels "saves" $258 billion over seven years. The roughly $40 billion in additional "savings" (bringing the total to $297 billion) is due to Clinton's proposal to spend less in future years, below what was spent in 1995. However, the Clinton budget would implement 95 percent of these cuts in FY 2001 and FY 2002, thus leaving the tough decisions to a future President and Congress.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The era of big government is far from over. The Administration's repeated use of gimmicks and accounting ploys to "balance the budget" casts doubt on its sincerity in negotiating a balanced budget plan with Congress. At every turn, Clinton fought attempts to cut spending, or even to reduce the growth in spending. Clinton challenged CBO's conservative economic assumptions because they required greater savings to balance the budget. In other words, he wanted more money for favored programs while claiming to support a balanced budget. Clinton repeatedly called on Congress to reduce the size of the BBA's tax cut package, not because eliminating the tax cuts would balance the budget any faster (say in five years rather than seven), but because smaller tax cuts would allow more money for government spending. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Early in the morning of March 8, China fired three nuclear-capable missiles into two areas close to the Republic of China on Taiwan as part of missile "tests" that will last until March 15. Moreover, from March 12 to March 20, China will hold large-scale naval military exercises that use live ammunition, also in an area close to Taiwan. These military actions are targeted at the ROC's March 23 presidential election and mark an escalation in Beijing's campaign to intimidate the citizens and leadership of democratic Taiwan. Beijing has designed the missile tests to emphasize China's ability to blockade Taiwan. The three missiles fired on March 8 fell into two zones astride Taiwan's two largest ports, and Beijing has warned commercial air and sea traffic to steer clear. The tests threaten both Taiwan's economic well-being and the safety of its citizens. They also stand as test of Washington's leadership and resolve, and challenge America's historic interest in maintaining freedom of the seas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration's March 10 decision to dispatch U.S. Navy aircraft carrier groups to waters near Taiwan to deter possible Chinese escalation was correct. Congress's response to these latest threats against Taiwan also has been strong. Speaker Newt Gingrich, for example, said they amounted to "an act of terror."  But while State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns called the missile tests "reckless and potentially dangerous," another State Department official told <I>The New York Times</I> the tests did not amount to an act of terror. Washington should protest China's missile intimidation in the strongest terms, reaffirm America's commitment to defending freedom of the seas, review U.S. commitments to Taiwan as stipulated in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, and accelerate the introduction of U.S. missile defense systems into Asia.
<p>
<b>CHINA'S MISSILE CAMPAIGN TO THREATEN TAIWAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;China is the only Asian country using nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate its neighbors. The tests which will last from March 8 to March 15 mark the second time China has employed missiles to threaten the people of Taiwan. Last July 21 to 26, China launched four 1,125-mile-range DF-21 missiles and two 375-mile-range M-9 missiles into an area roughly 90 miles north of Taiwan. Both the DF-21 and the M-9 are designed to carry conventional, chemical, or nuclear warheads. So far, the M-9 has been used in the latest tests, which target two areas of roughly 500 square miles each. One target area is located about 30 miles off the northern coast of Taiwan, east of the port of Keelung. The second is 47 miles directly west of the southern port of Kaohsiung.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Clear Escalation of Tension.</b> The new missile tests mark a clear escalation in China's pressure against Taiwan. The location of the northern target area raises the possibility that Chinese missiles may fly over Taiwanese territory, possibly even the capital city of Taipei. The failure of one M-9 missile in last July's exercise also raises the danger of an accidental strike on Taiwan. Moreover, the March tests follow months of threats. For example, during an early 1996 trip to China, former Clinton Administration Pentagon official Charles Freeman reportedly was told that China "has prepared plans for a missile attack against Taiwan consisting of one conventional missile strike a day for 30 days." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As also occurred in July, the current tests are taking place alongside large-scale Chinese ground and naval exercises in areas near Taiwan. The latest exercises have featured practicing the largest airborne assault ever conducted by China, as well as a huge amphibious exercise aimed at Taiwan. And from March 12 to 20, naval exercises using live munitions will take place close to major air and sea routes in the Taiwan Strait.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Virtual Blockade.</b> These new missile tests and naval exercises amount to a blockade of major air and sea lanes critical to Taiwan's survival. The southern port of Kaohsiung and the northern port of Keelung account for about 70 percent of Taiwan's trade, and exports account for about 40 percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product. Because of these tests, some shipping will have to be diverted. Moreover, about 30 flights a day that use routes near the northern test site will have to be re-routed. China's missile intimidation has damaged Taiwan's economy and threatens the economic confidence of the people of Taiwan. The March 4 announcement of the missile tests caused the Taiwan stock market to drop by 62 points the next day; the stock market has fallen 625 points since July 1995. The missile tests also have caused panic buying of gold, and the Taiwan government has had to reassure people that food and fuel have been stockpiled in the event of a blockade. Missile strikes or damage to shipping will further depress investor confidence and cause shipping insurance rates to skyrocket.
<P>
<b>TIME FOR WASHINGTON TO SHOW RESOLVE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;China's latest missile tests challenge America's interests in Asia. For over two centuries, the United States has defended freedom of the seas and stood for freedom of commerce. Indeed, these principles have been at the heart of America's open door approach to Asia and China. By using its military to create a virtual blockade near Taiwan's two major ports, and forcing a diversion of international air and sea traffic, China is challenging an enduring and vital American interest. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing's actions also stand as a challenge to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). Section 2 of the TRA states that "It is the policy of the United States to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United States."  Section 3 directs the President "to inform Congress promptly of any threat to the security or economic system of the people of Taiwan.... " The tests also call into question the very basis on which the U.S. established relations with China: the assumption that Taiwan's status would be resolved peacefully by the Chinese themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Above all, these tests are a challenge to American leadership and resolve in Asia. For over half a century, the United States has stood as the ultimate guarantor of stability and security in Asia. Given the stakes involved, the Clinton Administration's initial response to China's missile diplomacy was tragically weak. The Administration offered only a mild rebuke to China's missile tests in July 1995. Responding to the announcement of the current round of missile tests, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns argues that it is not "credible" to describe the missile tests as a blockade of Taiwan's ports. The Administration has yet to be as critical as former Clinton Administration CIA Director James Woolsey, who said the tests amount to a "de facto temporary and partial blockade [which is] aggressive, indefensible, dangerous.... " The Clinton Administration should undertake a stronger response to China's missiles. The U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li>Strongly reject Beijing's use of military force. Since the U.S. is the only power able to deter China's threat to peace, the Administration should make clear to China that military action against Taiwan may undermine the basis for continued peaceful U.S.-PRC relations. The Administration should remind Chinese leaders that normalization of relations was premised on the peaceful resolution of Taiwan's status. The U.S. should tell China that its use of force against Taiwan threatens peace in Asia. 
<p>
<li> Reaffirm America's vital interest in the freedom of the seas. The Administration should inform China that its missile tests near Taiwan pose an unacceptable threat to internationally recognized freedom of the high seas and airways. Ships from the Japan-based 7th Fleet, now dispatched to international waters near Taiwan, should remain in this region after the March 23 election, both to deter China and to underscore U.S. commitment to freedom of the seas. The U.S. also should consult with Asian allies and friends regarding possible sanctions against Chinese sea and air carriers in the event the missile tests harm ships or aircraft.
<p>
<li> Report to Congress that China is posing a danger to Taiwan's economic system. These missile tests constitute an attempt to blockade Taiwan's ports and airports. They could presage a more deliberate attempt to blockade Taiwan. In accordance with the TRA, the Clinton Administration must report to Congress that these actions pose a threat to Taiwan's economy. 
<p>
<li> Sell Taiwan defensive arms consistent with the TRA. China's missile threats against Taiwan point to an urgent need for missile defense in the ROC. Thus, to enable Taiwan to defend itself against any possible missile attack, the U.S. should offer to sell the ROC the Patriot PAC-2 GEM missile defense system. This is the most modern operable missile defense system in America's arsenal. If China persists with its missile threats, the U.S. should sell Taiwan more advanced missile defense systems as they enter U.S. service. 
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing's latest missile tests near Taiwan's two major ports are, for Washington, an unacceptable escalation in China's attempt to undermine the free and democratic spirit of the people of Taiwan. These threatening tests, combined with large Chinese naval exercises, also constitute a direct challenge to key U.S. interests, including the peaceful resolution of Taiwan's future and maintaining the freedom of navigation in Asia. As the only nation capable of deterring China, the U.S. should strongly protest China's missile threats, reaffirm the freedom of the seas by deploying the 7th Fleet, and sell missile defense systems to Taiwan.

<h2>A Cop Next Door</h2>
<b>by Walter Oleksy</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1991, the police department in Columbia, South Carolina, began offering low-interest mortgage loans to any officer willing to live in a high-crime or deteriorating neighborhood. One rundown house whose street address was 911 caught the attention of Officer James Brown. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I told my wife, 'That house is meant for us,'" he says. Brown's wife and two young children weren't so sure. The one-story brick house needed repairs, and the neighborhood was suffering frequent burglaries.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The department offered the Browns a mortgage loan with a 4 percent interest rate and no money down. Their only out-of-pocket expense was $5 for a credit check. They bought the house for $70,000, including $28,000 in renovation costs, and have lived in it happily for more than four years. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I dreamed of having my own home, but never thought it would happen," says Brown. "My neighbors say they see a big difference since my family and I moved in and I park my squad car out front. They tell me they sleep feeling safer, knowing I'm living here with them. I think the police homeowner program is great for me and the city."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Brown did not know it at the time, but by buying and moving his family into the "911 house," he became one of the first police officers in the nation to take part in a small but growing and  successful element of community-policing programs across the nation. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Police homeownership in high-risk neighborhoods is community-oriented policing at its very best," says Columbia police chief Charles Austin. "People in problem areas of our city used to complain that police aren't really sensitive to the problems of the community. 'Police don't live here,' they would say, 'so they don't really care what happens here.' Now they know that police officers live among them and do care."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Austin says the program is a major ingredient of his community-based policing plan. Overall crime rates have decreased 16 percent since 1991, and he attributes much of that  drop to the new home loan program, which induced 11 officers to move into some of the city's high-crime neighborhoods.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Like most other cities, the fight against crime and deteriorating homes leads the list of needs," says Richard J. Semon, Columbia's community-development director. He says that the program has also furthered the goal of revitalizing the city's housing and promoting homeownership.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The results have been overwhelmingly positive: The ongoing presence of police can help sustain or renew a sense of stability to a community. Suzanne House, a neighbor of one of the Columbia policemen in the program, agrees. "We had police at our community meetings, but it wasn't quite the same, if they didn't live here. With a police officer and his family living here and parking his squad car in front of his house, it's made a big difference. It makes us neighbors feel more safe."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"There used to be a crack house a block away," says Columbia resident Brooks Dickerson. "Since a policeman moved in here, it's gone. The neighborhood's much quieter now." The program is improving neighborhoods in part because it transforms the attitudes of police patrolling those neighborhoods. "I used to just work the neighborhood," says Officer Charles Rowson. "Now I give it 150 percent more, because my family and I live here. I no longer leave it after my shift and figure it's someone else's problem." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"It makes you a better police officer if you live in the area you patrol," says Corporal Randy Blackwell. "I rode my patrol car around the area for several years, but didn't live there. Since I own a home in the neighborhood and know the people who live here, I have a totally different opinion of it and them. The city of Columbia is no longer just a place where I go to work. It's where I live. You take a different interest in it, if you live where you work."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Young police officers and their families like the loan program because the low-interest and no-money-down mortgages offer them a chance to own a home years earlier than they otherwise could afford. The home loans include generous rehabilitation funds for older, rundown homes. The buildings, once prime candidates for demolition, are remodeled into attractive like-new homes both inside and out, including brand-new kitchens and landscaping.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It wasn't difficult to persuade Columbia bankers to support the effort. "Every bank we approached responded by saying yes," Semon says. "They agreed to provide 50 percent of financing below market rates, and each volunteered to do at least one loan." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Public-private partnerships do work," says Wayne Lovelace, a vice president of First Citizens Bank of Columbia. "We get a good loan, we address a social need, and a responsible buyer gets a house they couldn't otherwise afford. We're glad to be part of the program." As a result of the program, Columbia's police department has won a prestigious "Innovations in Policing" award from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, based in Washington, D.C.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since Columbia began its program, other cities have begun similar projects. In Sarasota, Florida, a homeownership program aimed at stabilizing certain neighborhoods offers participants up to 100 percent of the financing of a low-interest loan with no down payment and a take-home police car. Chicago's city council last year approved a program to assist police officers who buy homes in low and moderate-income neighborhoods. Suburban Elgin, Illinois, has offered a similar program since 1992.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has designed its own version of the concept, in cooperation with the police department and the Police Foundation, a research group in Washington, D.C. The program offers low-interest, 30-year, fixed-rate loans with no down-payments to police officers who move into designated neighborhoods and carry out certain community-oriented policing activities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Dubbed the "3-2-1 Program," the financial incentives to officers depend on the crime rates of the neighborhood in which they choose to reside. In the more desirable Area 3, 3-percent mortgages are offered with a $300 application fee, three loan points, and no loan forgiveness. In Area 2, officers may receive 2-percent mortgages with a  $200 application fee, two loan points, and one year of loan forgiveness for every two years of residency. In the high-crime Area 1, participants in the program can get 1-percent mortgages with a $100 application fee, one loan point, and a year's forgiveness for each year of residency. Every officer is assigned a patrol car, which he must park in front of his home when off duty. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nineteen officers who chose to participate in the program confirm that it makes people in the community feel safer, deters crime, and involves officers more deeply in the community they have sworn to protect. New Jersey's legislature is now considering a statewide version of the program. "Cops and crime can't coexist in the same neighborhood," says James Kennedy, the executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In many departments and cities, attempts to require officers to reside in the city they serve have become extremely contentious. Homeownership incentives may achieve a similar result without coercion. "When police officers are integrated into the fabric of the community," says Hubert Williams, the president of the Police Foundation, "they will get information that they could never get if they lived on the outer boundaries. And information is the life blood of a police department. The residency requirement is not very effective right now. We simply need another approach, and police homeownership in high-risk or deteriorating neighborhoods is proving to be a successful solution."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Police should be part of a community," says Richard Semon, the director of Columbia's community-development department. "Police homeownership is not the entire solution, but it is one effort, one piece of the puzzle. We think it is a vital part of the solution of deterring crime and revitalizing our neighborhoods."<p><I>For more information about this program, contact <b>Richard Semon</b>, community development director, Community Services, City of Columbia, 1225 Laurel St., Columbia, S.C. 29217.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the great debate about affirmative action that is about to begin, opponents of racial quotas and preferences must be prepared to offer a better way of opening opportunity for racial groups that have historically been victims of discrimination. The answer is high academic standards for everyone, a solution that the Clinton administration is, unfortunately, resisting.<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The greatest tragedy of public education today is the low expectations it sets for poor children, especially blacks and Hispanics. The prevailing assumption among teachers and principals in all too many poor neighborhoods seems to be: "These kids can't learn, and even if they do, society is so racist that there's no opportunity for them anyway."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why study hard if your teacher doesn't think you can learn? Racial quotas and preferences reinforce this defeatism by sending the message that blacks and Hispanics can succeed academically and economically only if they are held to a lower standard than Asians and whites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the experience of countless schools and teachers shows that, when much is expected of them, black and Hispanic children can achieve at a very high level. Test scores for racial minorities can rise by quantum jumps without the ugly practice of "race-norming," where test scores for blacks and Hispanics are artificially raised to compensate for their racial status.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consider the track record of Rafe Esquith, a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Hobart Elementary School in Los Angeles, near the site of the 1992 riots. Most children at Hobart are poor immigrants from families that don't speak English; 80 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, 2 percent African-American. Three-quarters have single parents, and many come from alcoholic families. But by the end of the sixth grade, his students have finished a year of algebra and classical literature -- including eight of Shakespeare's plays. His junior thespian crew, the "Hobart Shakespeareans," have performed with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company. Their performance of Measure for Measure will open the World Shakespeare Congress in Los Angeles this June.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How does Esquith bring out the best in his class? The same way outstanding teachers always do. He sets high standards, and gives his students the help they need to meet them. "I put my heart and soul into my teaching, and the kids know that. I demand the same from them." Esquith begins teaching his class of 40 students at 6:30 a.m. and teaches straight until 5 p.m. (They even eat lunch in the classroom.) By teaching his youngsters to solve difficult math equations and to read and perform Shakespeare early on, Esquith trains his kids to take on challenges that at first seem impossible.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The result: Last year, in the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (a test administered to the Los Angeles Unified School District), his fifth-graders achieved average scores in the 98th percentile, while the school itself scored in the 64th percentile, and the district in the 47th percentile. On the English test, they scored in the 92nd percentile, while the school overall scored in the 47th percentile, and the district in the 35th percentile. His sixth-grade class produced similar results -- even though all of Esquith's students speak English as a second language, and, but for his devotion, most would be written off as "slow" or "troubled."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Esquith's devotion to his students doesn't stop when they graduate from elementary school. On weekends he gathers his former students to prepare them for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The walls of his classrooms are filled with banners of colleges and universities like Harvard and Berkeley, institutions his students have gone on to attend; their names appear next to their respective schools. Most of these students are the first in their family ever to attend college.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Esquith's story is compelling, not only because his students do well, but because he proves that high expectations and hard work produce results. His students may be poor, but they will be able to compete in the marketplace on a level playing field because they are well educated, and Esquith -- the recipient of the Walt Disney Outstanding Teacher of the Year award in 1992 -- can trump most private-school teachers any day. Esquith's secret -- which seems to be well kept from most of the education establishment -- is his conviction that poor, inner-city kids can learn, and that the keys to educational success are high standards and hard work.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another example of the "aim high and achieve" model is Holy Angels Elementary School, described as an "oasis in the middle of the desert" by Jolene Pearl, a professor of education at Spring Arbor College. Every year, Pearl takes her students to Holy Angels to show them that a successful school need not be housed in a safe, affluent white neighborhood. Nor does it take a fortune to keep its door open. The 108-year-old South Side Catholic institution sits in the Kenwood-Oakland neighborhood of Chicago, where three out of four people live in poverty and violent crime is the rule rather than the exception. Holy Angels's enrollment includes 1,256 students -- all of whom are African-American -- from preschool to eighth grade, each paying a tuition of $40 to $45 per month. The school's motto: "Where Proud Black Youngsters Produce and Achieve." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I feel like I'm in a war zone," replies Sister Helen Struder, the school's principal, when asked how she feels about the location of her school. You'd never guess that from the students' performance. A comparison of scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills published by the Chicago Public Schools shows that, in 1994, the number of Holy Angels eighth-graders scoring above the national norm in math was quadruple the average number of eighth-graders at the three area public schools on the same test. The data also show that twice as many Holy Angels eighth-graders scored above the national norm in reading as did the average of the three area public school eighth graders. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How did this happen?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Sister Helen, who has been on the school's staff since 1960, before reaching her post as principal a year ago, believes that the secret to the school's success is threefold: its basic curriculum (mathematics, English, reading, science, and social studies), its strict discipline (it teaches respect for self and others and holds students responsible for their actions), and its high academic expectations for its students. Instead of making excuses for the children, Sister Helen and Holy Angels teachers expect them "to paddle their own canoes." Instead of offering an array of extracurricular classes or dumbing down its curriculum to increase the "self-esteem" of its African-American pupils, Holy Angels offers a strict diet of math and reading and expects students to get the job done. The principal believes that "by success you build self-esteem."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one can attest to the success of a school like Holy Angels or a teacher like Rafe Esquith better than Barbara Lerner. A lawyer and psychologist, she was an outspoken advocate of the "minimum competence testing" movement in the late 1970s -- a grass-roots movement demanding that no student be allowed to graduate from high school without first passing a test proving he or she had mastered basic skills in reading and math. Lawyers from the Center for Law and Education at Harvard and a bevy of other "experts" tried to convince the federal courts that this requirement was unconstitutional because in Florida -- the first of many states to adopt such a test -- 80 to 90 percent of African-American students failed it on the first few tries. Lerner's 1983 testimony in <I>Debra P. v Turlington</I> (the case challenging Florida's minimum competence test) convinced the courts that minimum competence testing provided just the push these kids needed, pointing out that by the fifth attempt, more than 90 percent of them passed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Lerner noted in a 1991 article in Commentary, children who mastered the basics went on to improve their scores on more advanced tests like the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) too, because "[m]inimum competence is the entry ticket in the race for advanced competence and, as in any race, increasing the number of entrants increases the number who cross the finish line." That, she argued, is why the SAT scores of African-American students rose by more than 47 points between 1980 and 1989. Lerner believes that the only way to expand the success of the minimum competence exam is to make it the standard for grade-school graduation, and also to require children to pass an advanced competence test like the SAT to graduate from high school. Such a test would go beyond literacy and numeracy to measure abstract reasoning and problem-solving ability with both words and numbers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Minimum competence tests have repeatedly been challenged in the courts by legal-services and civil-rights groups that contend, in Lerner's words, that the test "would hurt minority students the most, as a disproportionate number of them would fail the test and be denied high-school diplomas. That would stigmatize them for life, do severe damage to their self-esteem and motivation, and close off all further academic and career opportunities, locking them into a permanent underclass. The result would be a widening of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in American society, deepening our racial divisions and moving us away from equality and justice." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration makes a similar argument. In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education investigated Ohio's policy of requiring students to pass a ninth-grade proficiency test to see whether it violated the civil rights of minority students. Thanks to pressure from Republican congressman William Goodling, who depicted the Department of Education's involvement in Ohio as an "unwelcome intrusion into a state's education practices," the investigation was halted. But lawsuits and policies challenging advanced competency abound, and efforts to make earning a high-school diploma contingent upon passing a stringent exam bear a heavy political risk -- mainly because, at first, many students are likely to fail the tests. Currently, according to a 1995 report by the North Central Regional Education Laboratory, 17 states require all their high school students to pass some form of graduation test. Michigan, New York, and Tennessee offer state-endorsed diplomas, and New York, Ohio, and Tennessee offer honors diplomas.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;New York is one of the few states that has made huge strides in this area. Last year, thanks to Ramon Cortines, former chancellor of New York City's public schools, standards and accountability were reinstalled as the centerpiece of education in New York City. Cortines mandated Regents-level classes in mathematics and science for most incoming high-school students-to be phased in for sophomores, juniors, and seniors in the following three years. (Regents are college-level courses recommended by the state's education department and overseen by the Board of Regents. Students who take the achievement tests that correspond to the classes qualify for a Regents diploma.) Cortines's plan immediately eliminated many "bonehead" courses -- as he characterized them -- which typically had large minority enrollment. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to a report by the Hudson Institute, Education Reform 1994-1995, the results of the first year reveal that the course-failure rates rose among African-Americans and Hispanics, but also that the number of minorities taking and passing the more rigorous courses increased greatly. The enrollment of African-Americans in college-preparatory science rose by 129 percent and Hispanic enrollments by 265 percent. Compared with the previous school year, more than 6,500 additional African-Americans and 7,000 Hispanics passed the Regents science courses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly 50 percent more Hispanics took the test in 1995 than in 1994, and 2,033 passed it (280 more than the year before). About a third more African-American students took the exam, and 2,532 passed it (184 more than the year before). Cortines's bold efforts received a boost last year when State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills required that all New York City students not enrolled in Regents courses do so. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regents courses put pressure not only on students, but also on teachers. Many of the complaints about Cortines's and Mills's efforts come from educators unfamiliar with teaching Regents-level courses. But as Kay Toliver, an award-winning math teacher from East Harlem Tech puts it, the pressure to perform pays off.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;She should know. For 30 years, Toliver has been teaching elementary school and junior-high-school math at Public School 72/East Harlem Tech, a school for pre-kindergarten through eighth grade with 792 students, 88 percent of whom are Hispanic. She teaches pupils in grades four through eight in a program called the Challengers, designed for teaching mathematics in an integrated curriculum that emphasizes communications skills, history, and problem solving. She says she considers high expectations vital to success, "especially for students who are constantly being told they are 'disadvantaged' and who may have the impression that mathematics in particular is a subject beyond their abilities."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Every student can succeed in mathematics, even if [he or she has] never before been successful," Toliver wrote in the Journal of Negro Education. "I let my students know two things from the beginning: (1) I am with them to teach, and (2) I expect to be met halfway." She's determined to eliminate the stigma attached to poor minority students as underachievers. "I believe [that] the greater the problems surrounding the students, the more important it is that they triumph in their education and thus receive the key to a better life." Last spring, her fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-graders averaged above the 50th percentile on New York City's annual standardized math test, while the school scored in the 30th percentile.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1993, an award-winning PBS documentary, Good Morning Miss Toliver, brought her efforts to a wider audience. Since then, she has given many teacher-training workshops, and the Foundation for Advancement in Science and Education, in Los Angeles, has underwritten two sets of teacher-training videos featuring Toliver.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No wonder a good portion of her students end up in such elite schools as the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics. Perhaps forcing students to take Regents-level courses will result in the creation of many more teachers like Kay Toliver. Yet until more states decide to follow New York's lead in devising and mandating courses and exams like the Regents, teachers like Toliver will need to take on the challenge by expecting more from their students.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Brother Bob Smith, the principal of Milwaukee's private Messmer High School, sets similar standards of excellence. "We won't allow students to perform poorly because they are poor, black, or from single-family homes and have often suffered years of neglect," he says. "Our kids are evaluated and reviewed in the middle and at the end of each quarter. Our kids see themselves as students, not as black and white or members of a group." Messmer has 320 students, of whom 65 percent are African-American, 10 percent are Hispanic, and 25 percent are white or of other ethnic background. And how does Brother Bob's "no-nonsense" recipe fare? Forty of his 52 juniors taking the PSAT last fall scored in the top 30th percent nationally, his African-American students hold the same grade-point average as the school's white students, 98 percent of his students graduate, and 80 percent move onto college. All this at a per-pupil cost less than half that of any of the public high schools in the Milwaukee school system.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Opponents of race-based affirmative action are constantly challenged to offer viable alternatives. Their answer often includes myriad empowerment ideas, such as school choice and vouchers, each of which has been carefully crafted to address specific aspects of the problems affirmative action has failed to solve. As the accomplishments of Rafe Esquith, Sister Helen Struder, Ramon Cortines, Kay Toliver, and Brother Bob Smith demonstrate, promoting high standards is an idea that will boost achievement in a way affirmative action never has and never will. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These educators refute the fears of the civil-rights establishment that high expectations will forever tarnish the spirit of minorities, and are proof that the best kind of "affirmative action" is that which will teach children the discipline they need to advance in the educational and professional arena.<p><I><b>Nina H.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Over the past few decades, government welfare programs have 
been designed to lift the burden of caring for the poor from ordinary people, by allowing them to write a 
check to pay the professionals who would solve problems. It is time for government to reassert a healthy 
pressure on the American people: Congress should phase out federal-assistance programs and push states to 
develop ways for individuals and community-based groups to take over poverty-fighting responsibility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our predecessors understood the Constitution’s charge to 
provide for the common defense but to promote the general welfare -- by ensuring an environment within 
which individual and community action could flourish. When, for example, Congress in 1854 passed a bill 
for federal construction and maintenance of mental hospitals, President Franklin Pierce vetoed the bill. 
“Should this bill become law, that Congress is to make provision for such objects, the foundations of 
charity will be dried up at home,” he said.


<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Pierce's veto was sustained. His concern about “dried up” 
charity was typical of the era: Municipal aid to the poor could dry up private charity; state relief could dry 
up city aid; federal programs could dry up state efforts. Hardly the way to promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the mood of that era -- not to mention the Constitutional 
vision for addressing social needs -- has been lost. The concept of the modern welfare state placed 
responsibility for fighting poverty not at the lowest level but the highest. National entitlement programs 
came to dominate the social-services scene. The reversal of Pierce’s doctrine was so complete that even 
conservatives in the 1980s, who favored reducing the growth of welfare programs, still talked of the 
importance of maintaining a federal safety net. They did not understand that the federal safety net was not 
only inefficient, but conceptually mistaken.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<I>What?</I> Criticize the safety net itself? Yes. When I took 
my children to the circus recently, I realized how infrequently the Ringling Brothers safety net is used. For 
an acrobat, a fall to the safety net is a failure; if he falls stunt after stunt, he will be fired. Most people 
during the Depression had the psychology of the acrobat: The newly installed federal safety net was to be 
used only when the choice was between it and a hole in the ground. But over time, as attitudes softened and 
welfare programs expanded, that desire to avoid using the safety net was often lost. The destigmatizing of 
welfare in the 1960s meant that the acrobats no longer needed to strain for those extra inches, because the 
audience would still applaud even if they fell into the safety net every time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What America needs is not a safety net but a vast variety of 
small trampolines, suited to individual needs, movable so as to be present for individual crises, and 
providing a level of bounce fitted to the skill level and psychology of the individuals they are designed to 
save. Government’s role under such a plan is clear: Get rid of constraints on the construction and 
movement of trampolines, and -- if it does not appear that enough trampolines will be produced -- provided 
incentives to get more. In that way, government can promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What would this mean in terms of practical policy? Nothing 
short of a revolutionary proposal: We must place in the hands of state officials all decisions about welfare 
and the financing of it, and then press them to put welfare entirely in the hands of church- and community-
based organizations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Under this radically decentralist proposal, Congress would 
acknowledge that even the block-grant concept violates common sense -- far better to leave the money in 
the states in the first place. Congress would acknowledge that block grants reduce accountability, for the 
goal of block grants is to free state governments from centralized control, but it also tends to free them 
from taxpayer control because the funds are viewed as “free money” blown in from Washington. Congress 
would acknowledge that block grants tend to breed scandal; without real accountability to either the 
national capital or the state’s citizenry, funds are wasted and pressure mounts for Congress to attach not 
just strings but ropes to hold the sides of the box together.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In this scenario, a bold Congress, pushed hard by the 
newcomers of 1994 and 1996, would not fall into the same old trap and recentralize. Instead, Congress 
would pass, effective at the end of the block-grant era, a massive tax cut, with federal taxes decreasing by 
the amount no longer block-granted. (A side benefit: If Congress moves toward a flat tax, the tax rate could 
be set lower than is currently anticipated.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States would then use their own taxing authorities to implement 
new programs, or duplicate the old ones if they choose to do so. If a new Congress were to make that 
decision in 1997, states would have four years to plan for the post-federal welfare era. They could tax 
residents adequate amounts to care for the poor, but provide incentives for citizens to contribute sizable 
amounts of time or money to local poverty-fighting charities by providing exemptions to the new tax.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is not as if a dollar-for-dollar replacement for the $350 billion 
annual cost (in 1994) of federal and state welfare spending (70 percent of it coming from Washington) is 
necessary: We know that much money is wasted and worse than wasted, actually causes harm. Yet, if more 
trampolines are needed, we should not be opposed theoretically to governments, once they have worked to 
reduce barriers, also working to promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The best way for legislatures to do this would be to offer the 
average taxpayer a deal as follows: “Come the year 2001, under the Welfare Replacement Act of 1997, 
your federal tax burden will be reduced by an average of $3,000. We certainly do not want to be accused of 
being cruel or mean-spirited, so we will raise state taxes by an average of $2,500. However, we also want 
to promote personal involvement with community-based organizations that offer effective compassion to 
the poor, and if you provide to such an organization a combination of money and time totaling at least 
$3,000 -- thus leaving the quantity of societal commitment to the poor unchanged -- you will be exempt 
from the new tax.”
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This would obviously represent a sweeping change from the 
current system. Now, taxpayers who itemize can deduct from their taxable income the contributions they 
make to a wide range of religious, charitable, and educational organizations, at their marginal tax rate (the 
lowest is 15 percent, the highest is 39.6 percent). This is helpful, but not good enough, and movement 
toward a flat tax might eliminate that deduction anyway. Under the new system proposed here, states 
would push taxpayers in a massive way to become involved with groups that provide direct social services 
to the poor, and offer exemption from taxation for such purposes to those who were helping others in their 
own way.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At least 11 critical questions about such a revolutionary 
departure from current practice immediately arise:
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>What percentage of taxpayers would choose to support local 
charities and thereby gain exemption?</I></b> That is very difficult to predict, but with four years of 
preparation it is likely that many would, resulting in a tremendous boost to nonprofit finances and a large 
increase of citizen involvement. Those who did not become involved would pay the new tax, and states 
could use that fund to pay for any missing trampolines.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Would church-based and community-based organizations be 
ready to expand or replicate themselves in order to make use of their new resources in a new 
century?</I></b> They would have time to prepare, and the encouragement of a new system would blow 
away the “compassion fatigue” that has built up over the years. 
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Would acceptance of exemption-creating contributions force 
poverty-fighting charities to accept governmental control?</I></b> At the moment, charitable 
organizations that seek government grants come under government oversight; some church-related 
programs have gained financially but lost their souls in the process. Even nonreligious charities accepting 
public funds have been forced to treat all of their clients bureaucratically, within the parameters set by law 
and regulation, rather than dealing with each human being on an individual basis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The advent of “new tax” exemptions would not automatically 
free up religious groups and other community-based institutions to participate as equals in the social 
services sector. Despite precedents set by the GI Bill and other programs that allowed consumer choice, the 
ACLU would not be amused by the removal of secular liberalism from its established, privileged place.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Still, the offer of an exemption (signifying a right not to pay 
because of other services rendered) is as clear a hands-off statement as a legislature can make. Exemptions 
offer a greater degree of protection than deductions, credits, or especially vouchers, since the latter requires 
government not only to overlook revenue but to send out checks. A political coalition strong enough to 
obtain tax exemptions should be strong enough to keep them from being abused by antireligious zealots.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Wouldn’t some exemptions from taxation go for funds sent to 
phony, needless, or simply ineffective projects? Wouldn’t these cases be cited by partisans of the 
welfare state as reasons for opposing the exemption system?</I></b> Certainly, and those cases would 
make an impact on people who are startled to find that some among their fellow human beings are foolish, 
incompetent, or gullible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Markets work not because everyone exercises perfect 
judgment, but because, on balance, most people make good judgments most of the time. Even with all the 
anticipated human error, a charitable sector in which the funds are allocated by individual private decisions 
is likely to be less wasteful than the current system. Besides, with more resources at stake, more careful 
analysis of charitable effectiveness is likely to become common. Publications that examine charities the 
way a Consumer Reports examines products would emerge.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Wouldn’t acceptance of volunteer time as part of the 
exemption-creating contribution open the door to fraud?</I></b> It is true that proof regarding the 
giving of money tends to be clearer than that concerning time, the valuation of which can be complicated. 
Still, emphasis on the crucial meaning of compassion -- suffering with -- is vital, and a plan that provides 
incentives for contribution of money but not time is incomplete.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many groups already keep records of volunteer hours, so 
bookkeeping would not be an insurmountable problem. Corruption could be kept to a minimum by keeping 
the general credit for exemption purposes at the level of the minimum wage -- enough to provide a bit of 
compensation for work time lost and to signify societal commitment to compassionate action, but not 
enough to promote widespread cheating.
<P>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>What would happen to health care for the poor?</I></b> 
Medicaid is the single biggest element of current federal and state welfare expense; of the $324 billion that 
federal and state agencies spent on welfare in 1993, $132 billion went for that one program. And yet, many 
cities have free or sharply-reduced-price clinics where some dedicated doctors and nurses volunteer their 
time. What can governments do to help such organizations?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Jackson, Mississippi, the Voice of Calvary Family Health 
Center sees about 8,000 patients each year, and would like to expand its operations or start other clinics 
like it. Center director Lee Harper contrasts her clinic with higher-budgeted state operations and concludes, 
“When you have more money, you tend to waste more.” Still, she needs more funds. Job one, however, is 
getting more hours from volunteer doctors, dentists, and nurses. “If we get the health professionals, we’ll 
get the money.”
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such an urgent need translates into a specific proposal that 
could be implemented at the federal level in lieu of all the macro-reform proposals of the 1990s: Give 
medical professionals tax credits for hours regularly worked at clinics. If a typical doctor, dentist, or nurse 
worked one day every two weeks at a clinic or in a similar way spent time to provide health care to poor 
individuals, billions of dollars in medical expenses could be saved. Participating health personnel, in 
return, could receive a tax credit equivalent to 10 percent of their salaries. Such a credit could be the 
cornerstone of the personal alternative to bureaucratic health-care plans that are rightly regarded with 
skepticism.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why substitute a state tax (with exemptions) for a federal 
one? Why not simply reduce taxes and allow individuals to spend the money as they see fit?</I></b> 
Advocates of individual rather than governmental responsibility have the personal emphasis right, but will 
a reliance merely on individual goodwill and effort lead to the production of enough trampolines? For 
those who emphasize original sin rather than natural goodness, there is a middle ground between 
government and individual: Call it societal responsibility, within which government requires payment but 
leaves to the individual taxpayer how the money shall be spent.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>Will it be possible to restrict tax-exempting contributions to 
those organizations that are actually engaged in fighting poverty and its associated 
pathologies?</I></b> In some cases the correct category will be obvious, but in others careful judgment 
will be required. For example, it would seem that general donations to a college or a private school should 
not be used for exemption purposes, but donations to a college or school scholarship fund for poor students 
should be. General donations to a church should not produce an exemption, but those to the church’s 
specific poverty-fighting endeavors (an anti-addiction program for example) should be. General donations 
to a hospital should not; donations to a free or reduced-rate clinic for the poor should.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such categorization would be necessary, even though it could 
cut into the individual flexibility that straightforward tax reduction would allow. No matter how carefully 
state legislatures define the new tax category for poverty-fighting organizations, officials would have to 
write and apply regulations implementing the new tax. That authority potentially could allow a state 
agency to exclude organizations that it did not favor for ideological, theological, or political reasons. Some 
organizations might change what they do and the way they do it in order to conform to the regulatory 
standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such a threat does not mean that the new system could not 
work. It does mean that eternal vigilance will continue to be the price of liberty.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why not rely on pure voluntarism to do what is 
necessary?</I></b> The seeds of welfare replacement are already planted; if we wish to move quickly 
enough to save a generation of children during the first decade of the 21st century, those seeds need lots of 
water. If men were angels, no incentives for goodness would be necessary, but devolution to the states and 
further devolution through an exemption system is a good way for human beings to shift resources from 
the public sector to the private sector. Such a shift would provide a pool of capital for worthy charities to 
use in replicating themselves and thus replacing the welfare state.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stimulation of voluntarism through tax exemption is an 
impure tactic, but our predecessors in this country, with their realistic view of human nature, were not 
above using impure motives to promote virtue. Colonial settlers who took in a poor person received 
compensation from the township, and some of them may occasionally have profited a bit (although that 
would be more than made up for by the time they spent mentoring the needy person). A farm family that 
adopted an orphan gained a farm hand, though the economic advantage was outweighed by the hard task of 
being new parents to someone who had grown up under tough conditions.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why require $3,000 to receive the exemption from payment 
of $2,500?</I></b> If some people hesitate to give (in money or minimum-wage time) the greater amount 
necessary to receive an exemption, that is fine; the quality of their giving would probably be low. Some 
personal contribution by the taxpayer is important to build a sense of involvement with and responsibility 
for the work of the charitable organization. The goal is to have as many taxpayers as possible think through 
their giving, and not merely respond to direct-mail appeals.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why would taxpayers be expected to make better decisions on 
groups to support than government officials have?</I></b> Competition has made the American 
economy the strongest in the history of humanity, and the American political system the envy of the world. 
The American people have proven themselves capable, on average and over the long haul, of making good 
economic and political judgments. Taxpayers who invested $500 of their own money and time in order to 
direct $2,500 to satisfying projects would be likely to make equally good judgments in the charitable 
sphere.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Decisions about where funds shall go would no longer be a 
function of political struggles over the budgets of government agencies, but would result from the 
decisions of millions of individual donors. Independent charitable organizations would for the first time in 
generations be on a level playing field with those groups favored by government. Some errors would 
occur, but there is every reason to expect this system of delivering assistance to the needy to be far more 
effective than the current model of top-down government monopoly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Yes, some innovators would fail, but isn’t it better to win a 
football game 50-14 than to play so defensively as to fall into a 3-3 tie? Given the growing number of 
damaged children and ruined adults under our current regime, isn’t it better to take the rational risks that 
could liberate millions, rather than suffer constant winter without Christmas?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, decentralization offers the best shot for each state to 
innovate in the way that is right for its unique population and specific problems. Since we do not know 
precisely which legislative plan would best promote the offering of individual compassion, an emphasis on 
state-level action maximizes the opportunity to find out for sure which tactics work best. Furthermore, 
there may be greater opportunity to move quickly in some states than in Washington.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While each state would have to sort out its particular 
problems, all must face, for example, rising rates of illegitimacy. Abstinence programs are a start. When 
pregnancy nevertheless results and marriage does not, states should foster group-living arrangements for 
women while pregnant and during the year or two afterwards, so that those who would otherwise be alone 
will have a support network. States should challenge biases against adoption, and stress the advantages to 
the child of adoption at birth (or up to age two, at the latest). Having a baby out of wedlock should not 
bring with it the reward of any governmental cash payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No public-policy measure can take the place of the personal 
changes that are necessary to raise high the standard of American compassion. With supportive laws and 
rules compassionate individuals can make real progress toward reducing some of our most serious social 
pathologies, but the crucial change is still the one that goes on in each individual soul, not in the federal or 
state capitols.

Gingrich plan puts focus on Clinton
</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>By Donald Lambro<BR><font size=1>
The Washington Times</font><HR WIDTH=30%></center>

<BR><DD>Republican leaders, decrying "the looming Clinton
recession," are crafting a legislative agenda for the campaign
year that focuses on economic growth, jobs, incomes and some
issues favored by social conservatives.
<BR><DD>GOP leaders on
Feb. 23 also began fine-tuning their message in an attempt to
better explain how their party's proposed budget and tax cuts
can help average working-class voters worried about a
declining economy.
<BR><DD>House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who
has been keeping a low profile during the early rounds of the
Republican primary fights, laid out the new message Feb. 23 in
a memorandum to GOP leaders that sought to ally his party
with growing voter anxiety and anger over job losses and
stagnant or falling incomes.
<BR><DD>"In the first caucus and
primary votes of 1996, the American electorate reminds us
clearly that the failing Clinton economy has short-changed
American workers and their families. Republicans understand
this anger," Mr. Gingrich said.
<BR><DD>Last year Republicans
passed tax and spending cuts to "allow families to keep more
of their hard-earned income" and to spur economic expansion
and job creation, he said. But in the end these and other
reforms to strengthen the economy "died at the tip of Bill
Clinton's veto pen."
<BR><DD>Haley Barbour, Republican National
Committee chairman, also attacked Mr. Clinton's economic
record Feb. 23, saying the "looming Clinton recession" was the
result of the president's decision to raise taxes in 1993 and
increase government regulations. "No wonder wages are
stagnant -- the government got your pay raise. It's no surprise
there are fewer jobs; the government is soaking up most of the
money that could be used for job creation," he said in a speech
to the Conservative Political Action Conference.
<BR><DD>"The
growing Clinton recession -- with its wage stagnation and
economic insecurity -- is the result of Clinton's high-tax,
big-government policies," he said.
<BR><DD>The combined
RNC-House Republican attacks are part of a new, coordinated
strategy to maintain a drumbeat of attacks on the White House
and the Democrats "from now until the November elections,"
GOP officials said.
<BR><DD>"Our message got lost last year in
the budget negotiations. We did not effectively explain what
our reforms would mean to average Americans. We need to
make sure that doesn't happen this year," said a senior House
GOP official.
<BR><DD>Mr. Gingrich's broadside came at a time of
increasing division and debate among the GOP presidential
candidates over the party's message, and increasing evidence
that GOP primary voters are responding to the economic
anxiety issues that Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes have raised
in their campaigns.
<BR><DD>The Gingrich memorandum came as
welcome news to his GOP colleagues in the House, who have
been urging him to speak out much more forcefully against Mr.
Clinton and the Democrats to counter the primary fights that
have been dividing his party.
<BR><DD>"I'm glad he's speaking
out, finally. We need his voice in this debate about where we're
going," said Rep. Helen Chenoweth, a freshman Republican from
Idaho.
<BR><DD>Mr. Gingrich and his chief deputies continued to
work late last month on a new legislative strategy and a
stronger marketing plan aimed at highlighting policy
differences with Mr. Clinton in the campaign, especially
economic policy.
<BR><DD>His party's case for tax cuts and
fiscal reforms to spur economic growth was bolstered Feb. 23
by new government statistics showing the economy grew by
only 0.9 percent during the last three months of 1995. He also
acknowledged that the GOP has not done a good job of
connecting with the economic concerns of middle-class
families.
<BR><DD>"We must be prepared to communicate our
response to legitimate voter anger in a clearer and more
forceful manner than we have done so far," the speaker
said.
<BR><DD>"We are with the American people now and will
produce legislation that addresses their concerns throughout
the spring and summer."
<BR><DD>GOP officials who attended Mr.
Gingrich's strategy meetings last month said they were
focusing their agenda for the rest of the year on issues that
would "get the economy moving," create jobs and improve
incomes. Most of the agenda will be drawn from the "Contract
With America," including tax and budget cuts, curbs on
entitlements, and regulatory relief for
businesses.
<BR><DD>Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the GOP's
chief deputy whip, was assigned to develop a "market-driven"
health care reform plan that will include medical savings
accounts and provisions to allow workers to keep their health
care protection when they change jobs.
<BR><DD>"We want to
make sure that middle-class Americans can get health
insurance if they lose their job. We'll probably bring it up
before this summer," Mr. Hastert said.

<H2>Charities on the Dole</h2>

<b>by Kimberly Dennis</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Those who expect America’s charities to replace government as a 
provider of social welfare ought to look a little closer. They will find that the so-called independent sector, 
which receives between one-quarter and one-third of its funds from taxpayers, isn’t so independent after 
all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In fact, many social-service agencies actually receive most of their 
funding from government. Save the Children owes 60 percent of its budget to the generosity of taxpayers, 
Catholic Charities 65 percent, CARE 78 percent, and the United Cerebral Palsy Association more than 80 
percent. Topping this list is the inaptly named Volunteers of America, which receives 96 percent of its $51-
million budget from government sources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal government now channels $39 billion a year in grant 
money through nonprofits. New York’s social-service economy employs more people than Wall Street. 
Private social-service agencies actually represent the city government’s largest group of vendors.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The government–nonprofit complex doesn’t just consume taxpayer 
money. It uses that money to lobby for government programs that would consume even more taxpayer dollars. Congressmen <a href="http://www.house.gov/istook/welcome.html">Ernest Istook</a> and David McIntosh have drawn widespread attention to this problem through their efforts to limit federal  
financing for nonprofits that engage in political advocacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We now know that the American Association of Retired Persons, 
which must share some of the blame for our teetering Social Security system, received $74 million in 
government funds in 1994. The Environmental Defense Fund, an advocate of stringent business regulation, 
got $500,000 in government support. The National Council of Senior Citizens, which received $71 million 
courtesy of taxpayers, recently spent much of its energy lobbying Congress on behalf of President 
Clinton’s health-care proposals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tax-funded nonprofits also compete with the very profitmaking 
businesses whose taxes support them. In Pennsylvania, a nonprofit hospital that receives government funds 
operates a marina. In New York, government-funded housing competes with private development, and 
homeless shelters crowd out cheap single-room-occupancy residences. In our nation’s capital, George 
Washington University, a nonprofit institution that receives public funds, operates a hotel and a restaurant.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nonprofits that compete with businesses to provide of goods and 
services take advantage of tax exemption in many ways. In 1993, the Children’s Television Workshop 
received $22.5 million in tax-free royalties from the sale of Sesame Street products. A Sesame Street store 
just opened in an Indianapolis mall; one can only wonder how the owners of the toy shop a few doors away 
feel about losing business to a store that generates tax-free revenues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The independent sector’s natural affinities should lie with the business 
sector. After all, its vitality depends on the wealth business creates. But as more and more support for 
nonprofits is channeled through government, the independent sector’s allegiances have shifted to Capitol 
Hill and the federal bureaucracy. It is not just that these institutions think their well-being (and hence 
society’s) depends on a generous government. They also view for-profit ventures as second-rate, morally 
inferior, and perhaps even evil. They’d rather see people eat in a soup kitchen than in a diner, live in a 
“habitat for humanity” than in a trailer park.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are, of course, many small, innovative, and values-driven grass-
roots charities that are addressing human needs much more efficiently than failed federal programs and 
social-service agencies. These groups mostly avoid government money, because they know that 
government support comes with strings attached.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These strings involve more than just paperwork and regulations. 
Government support also changes charities’ incentives, giving them reasons to keep caseloads up instead of 
getting them down by successfully turning around peoples’ lives. It distorts their missions. It turns lean, 
cost-effective organizations into bloated bureaucracies, and dilutes their spiritual or religious message. In 
instances where the Salvation Army decided to accept government funds (which constitute about 15 
percent of its revenues), it stopped requiring church attendance as a condition of its assistance. 
Unfortunately, this experience is all too common. The charity that stays genuinely independent from 
government is still the exception.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although charities are supposed to offer an alternative to government 
provision of social welfare, they have become so dependent upon and aligned with government that they 
no longer represent a way out of the welfare state. If we place our faith in private nonprofits as they are 
currently organized, we are in for a big disappointment. Before we can rely on charities to help us 
dismantle government, they must wean themselves off the dole.

<I>The following remarks were delivered at &quot;The New Majority:
 Democratic Governance in a Revolutionary Age&quot; conference,
hosted by The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation on January 22,
1996.  The conference explored the possibility of political realignment
and asked:  Is there a &quot;new majority&quot; taking shape in
America and other western-style democracies?  Who is part of the
new majority, what are its beliefs - and how is it related to
the transition from an industrial to an information-age economy?
 Which (if either) American political party is best positioned
to represent it?  And, what impact will it have on the 1996 presidential
election?</I>
<P>
<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<B>by <a href="#webe">Vin Weber </a></B>
<P>
Along with the United States itself, America's key allies are
transforming themselves away from the industrial age that has
dominated the past century just as surely as they moved away from
the agrarian age in an earlier time.  While the outlines of the
new era are yet to be determined, we know that it will be overwhelmingly
influenced by the information technology that is now upon us -
every day we hear something new about the Internet, Cyberspace
and virtuality.
<P>
The private sector has been learning the lessons of the new age
for more than a decade. General Motors, IBM and AT&amp;T have
learned that bureaucratic, centralized organizations must be replaced
because success in the information age demands decentralization
and empowerment.  Government too must remake itself for a new
age.  The idea that programs run by a bureaucracy concentrated
in Washington, D.C. is the preferred method for addressing the
nation's problems is no longer tenable.
<P>
As the people remake government for the 21st century, three major
trends become clear: devolution, diffusion and connection. Devolution
is sending power and responsibility to the lowest level possible
for effective decision-making.  Shifting from Federal to state
or local control is just a trickle today. Diffusion is relying
on non-governmental organizations or individuals to perform many
of the functions government usurped during the industrial era.
 The use of vouchers, privatization, voluntary organizations,
charities and churches are among the tools of diffusion. The final
trend is connection. This has less to do with government than
with individuals. We must return to the sense of community we
once had.  The most important people are those closest to you.
You must want to help - and feel a responsibility for -  yourself,
your family, your friends and your neighbors.
<P>
Remaking government in such a manner is indeed a democratic revolution.
 Often times it appears that the leaders of such a revolution
are radicals, acting alone in the woods.  Yet if we look around
the world, we see that different cultures and political traditions
are facing basically the same set of facts as they too make the
transition to the information age. In bringing together the leading
agents of political change in America, Great Britain, Japan and
Canada, we found that to a remarkable degree their ideas reinforce
each other.  In their own way and working within their own political
traditions, they describe similar goals for achieving the best
form of government for the information age.
<P>
These leaders also demonstrate how important correct political
management is.  The degree of change required in government organization
is so great that delaying it, stifling it or trying to stop it
will only hurt citizens.  Yet in America, President Clinton has
adopted the rhetoric - &quot;the era of big government is over&quot;
- while actually governing in the opposite manner.  In Britain,
the democratic revolution is at risk by the Tory Prime Minister.
And in Canada, the Conservatives went from governing the country
to having only two seats in the Parliament after they failed to
offer the correct policies of progress.
<P>
As Americans debate the proper role of government in the 21st
century, it is important for them to see models of success and
failure.  By bringing together four remarkable leaders, we hope
to discover some lessons ourselves.
<P>
<h3><a name="age">The Age of New Realities</a></h3>
<B>by <a href="#ging">Newt Gingrich </a></B>
<P></a>
In thinking through what is similar that is driving Canada, Britain,
Japan and America, I think there are three large realities that
will shape everything else we're doing for a very long time.
<P>
The first is the world market.  The world market is going to impose
continuing pressure for competitive modification.  All of the
western democracies - and here I will include Japan as a western
democracy - are faced with the same challenge: how to become dramatically
more productive as societies in order to compete in a 21st century
market in which China and other countries such as Thailand, Pakistan
and India will be playing more and more competitive roles.   This
goes much beyond manufacturing, into the whole question of education,
of tax codes and of entrepreneurship.  The Europeans, frankly,
have been less successful at such adaptation, which is reflected
in very high unemployment rates.  Yet the world market will apply
continuing pressure, and America and Japan are going to face that
pressure fully as much as the Europeans.  
<P>
The second reality is the rise of the information age.  Alvin
and Heidi Tofler describe it as the Third Wave, and it is at least
comparable to the rise of the industrial world that Adam Smith
was writing about in the late 18th Century. It is a change so
large that it will force us to rethink everything we're doing.
 The degree to which we can do that in an open, positive, conscious
way will be dramatically better than if we just stumble into it.
The rise of an information age or of a Third Wave civilization
is going to affect every society on the planet, and I think all
of us have to get used to that and have to figure out therefore
what is it we're doing.  For instance, a new species was recently
discovered in Laos in the national park.  National parks are a
19th century American invention that have rapidly spread across
the planet.  They are an example of what happens as you go through
this kind of modification. All of us are going to find ways to
deal with the information age; they're going to turn out to be
remarkably similar over time, but those societies which are on
the cutting edge will have higher incomes and greater choices.
 Those societies which resist the information age will have lower
incomes and fewer choices.
<P>
The third thing challenging all of us is an expanding definition
of human.  If you go back to the 18th century, basically propertied
white males counted and everybody else was relatively less important.
Yet over the last 200 years, we've had a continually expanding
sense of what does it mean to be human.  As we get to a point
of including everybody and deciding that we're prepared to spend
resources to include them, we're going to be challenged with a
greater and greater intensity to deal with the question, how do
we include everyone to the fullest of their ability and how do
we compensate for those who might have been genetically or otherwise
disadvantaged?  
<P>
Those three factors, the world market, the information age and
the expanding definition of being human, are realities for all
societies and particularly for all democratic societies.  There
are also three facts that industrial societies in particular face.
<P>
The first fact is the failure of state central planning. The collapse
of the Soviet Empire demonstrated this most clearly.  Many of
our friends on the left bitterly regret that it failed and prefer
to ignore its demise.  The Clinton Administration is the last
stand in this country of a genuine belief that centralized planning
makes sense. But the fact is it just failed.  
<P>
The second fact is the failure of secular bureaucracy.  It turns
out that as ways of saving human beings, secular bureaucrats are
among the least successful.  We need to say that more often. 
For example, when our President talks about investing in education,
we should first say, all right, if you're spending $9,000 per
child in Washington, D.C., maybe the problem isn't money.  But
we're not willing to be blunt enough and tough enough about the
obvious failure of secular bureaucracy as a delivery system for
dramatically improving human beings.
<P>
The third fact is the failure of emphasizing redistribution over
production of wealth.  Going back in some ways to 19th century
French socialism, there has been a fascination with redistribution
of wealth, particularly by those who don't produce well.  Emphasized
by the news media and the academic classes - both of whom believe
it's wonderful to spend somebody else's money - the result has
been a focus for the last 70 years on the notion that if only
we accepted the finite limit of wealth and then redistributed
it, everybody would be better off.
<P>
In truth, the objective, historic, long-term fact is that societies
that focus on creating wealth outstrip societies that focus on
redistribution in improving the lot of the poorest people.  That's
an objective fact historically.  Societies that focus on getting
rich bring everybody up at a dramatically faster rate than societies
that focus on redistribution. In fact, if you try to raise the
bottom in a static model you rapidly get resistance from everybody
else, because, by definition in a static model, only achieving
it not by sharing the new wealth, which people are rather comfortable
doing, but by taking away from people what they already have.
<P>
Thus my core critique of the left as I think it is emerging in
the late 20th century is that: first, the state central planners
have failed; second, secular bureaucracies don't transform people;
and third, emphasizing redistribution is a dead loser in helping
the poor compared to focusing on the production of wealth.  This
leads me to seven principles that may be peculiarly an American
formulation.
<P>
First, that there's a spiritual basis of freedom.  There's a reason
that the Founding Fathers said we're endowed by our Creator. 
In fact, being human is a spiritual, not a biological fact, and
may be the most important thing that distinguishes us from purely
biological organisms.  If you don't have a system that says there's
a spiritual basis for being human, you have only a lawyer's definition
of human rights and that's a very shallow framework.  
<P>
Second is that we believe in the power of technological advance
to increase the potential for human goals. You get a better environment
over time and a better approach to helping the poor with a higher
technology society rather than with a Luddite approach. The truth
is that if you go back to the beginning of the Neolithic period,
over time and as a general principle, more technology is better
than less.  On balance technology tends to be used more for good
even though it can also produce gun powder and atomic weapons.
 
<P>
Third, the power of the entrepreneur and the free market to create
wealth is extraordinary.  Whenever possible it needs to be optimized.
 Entrepreneurs and the free market are likely to create more wealth
for more people and therefore over time actually improve a lot
of the poor better than either redistribution or secular bureaucracies.
 
<P>
Fourth is the importance of the individual and families.  That
is the core argument for tax cuts: who spends your money better,
you or a secular bureaucracy? We don't emphasize the moral content
behind tax cuts enough.  This is a moral fight.  Should you have
the right to your resources or should somebody you've never met
have the right to your resources, and if so, what's their claim?
 Why should they have the right to take from you? Yet we lack
the courage because we are still in a leftist world in which we
believe the money belongs to the government and who are we to
give you back your own money.  I think we need to be much more
aggressive and much more assertive in saying there's a moral basis
for tax cuts.  It's called individual freedom and the right of
families to spend their own money.  
<P>
Fifth is the power of volunteerism, which is in many ways a peculiarly
American contribution to the modern world.  Best described by
de Tocqueville, it is another argument for lower taxes.  How can
you be a volunteer if you're indentured to the state? If we want
more volunteerism, we need to leave more resources with those
who would volunteer.  It's a moral cause that requires we ask:
which does a better job of helping people, secular bureaucracies
or the variety of volunteer methods of reaching out?  
<P>
Sixth is the importance of appropriate government.  I am not an
extreme Libertarian.  I in fact believe there are many things
we want the government to do - protect our borders, stop the drug
trade, insure public health.  I'd like to make sure, for example,
that we don't go back to having yellow fever or malaria on a grand
basis.  These are not small things.  It is a very strong government
that can defend its borders, stop epidemics and maintain an honest
dollar.  I am for a strong government, but I'm for an appropriate
government. That means minimum bureaucracy, maximum free enterprise
and a tax code which encourages volunteerism and encourages families.
 
<P>
Lastly is the importance of language and grammar.  It goes back
in a sense to Orwell's argument in the <I>Politics in the English
Language,</I> which is an essay that every would-be revolutionary
should read.  The fact is that the left steals our language. 
The left defends the most grotesque destruction of human beings
in the modern social state by arguing that we would be cruel to
the poor by liberating them from the very shackles which the leftists
fasten on them.  I can imagine nothing worse for an American child
than subjecting them to the welfare system of Washington, D.C.,
and it's not for lack of money.  It is because the system is inherently
destructive of human beings. I can imagine nothing more liberating
for the children of Washington than to abolish their schools tomorrow
morning and replace them with a scholarship for every child of
$9,000 and allowing them to go to any school that wants to charge
them and actually teach them how to read and write.

<h3><a name="rev">The Conservative Revolution</a></h3>
<B>by <a href="#redw">John Redwood </a></B>
<P>
With so many conservatives meeting to discuss revolution, it's
as if Edmund Burke could turn up at the Communist International.
 Should I be meeting like this with all of you with such an agenda?
 Yes, of course I should and we should, for only those who recognize
the revolutionary power of change as we hurtle toward the next
millennium have a chance of seizing the democratic mandate and
of conserving what is best in our traditions.
<P>
It was not we conservatives, after all, who unleashed the dynamic
hurricane of the third industrial revolution, nor was it western
conservatives who carried a keynote to government in the Philippines,
took to the streets in Romania and swept aside the Communists
or who tore down the blocks in the Berlin Wall hand by hand. 
It was the force of the people themselves in all their infinite
ingenuity and their diversity.  It was we conservatives who stood
firm for the principles and truths which now inspire so many around
the world, the truths of free trade, freedom under the law, of
one man, one vote.  We owe President Reagan and Prime Minister
Thatcher a debt of gratitude for standing up to the mighty U.S.S.R.
and precipitating its collapse from within while the Liberals
would have none of it, and if they had had none of it, we would
live in a much less interesting world.  
<P>
The mighty forces of change have given us hope for a better world,
a world free of Communist tyranny, a world where more look to
the ballot box to resolve their differences, a world where more
can hope to enjoy the fruits of global capitalism.  Never have
so many looked forward to such riches before.  
<P>
But those same forces have generated great feelings of insecurity
in western electorates.  So fast is change that people fear for
their own jobs.  Where will I be working next year they ask. 
What new things must I learn to carry on working?  Will I have
a job at all?  In the United States and the United Kingdom, fears
about jobs are allied to worries about the stability of the traditional
family.  All too many children will go to bed tonight in New York
or in London in a home with no father.  All too many children
are born into a home which has never known the presence of a father.
 And all too many modern marriages are straining to breaking point.
 
<P>
In such a world, voters look to politicians not just to lead a
revolution, but to reassure.  They want us to waive magic wands
to remove the uncertainties.  They see a bloated public sector
that is arrogated itself men, money and management in a stunning
array of powers, services and agencies.  They expect such a colossus
to help and protect them, but all too often they are bitterly
disappointed.  
<P>
Free schooling may be provided but some children fall further
and further behind because they are not well taught.  Free health
care is provided but only sometimes if you're prepared to queue
and wait a year.  Each subsidy in government intervention fails
to stop redundancies.  Incomes are taxed ever more highly to meet
the unsatiable demands of the expanding state.  The numbers on
welfare grow as more miss out on the technological roller coaster.
 
<P>
It was that American, John Kenneth Galbraith, who complained of
private affluence and public squalor as he rallied a former generation
to a program of more government.  Today we are running the risk
of private squalor and public affluence.  We have certainly reached
in many western societies public waste and enforced private prudence.
 The take home pay of government and the numbers on its payroll
has far expanded far more rapidly than that of most others.  
<P>
People feel let down by many traditional politicians.  As government
has grown, there has been a wish to hold office but shuffle off
responsibility.  In Europe, the European Commission is never to
blame for anything.  When something goes wrong, it seeks others
to be scapegoats.  Many politicians now wish to make elections
matters of image and presentation rather than of substance.  The
sound bite rules the airways even though it may not come from
the heart of he who uttered it and rarely comes from his pen.
 As a result, the people, the electors, come to fell manipulated,
cheapened or cheated.  
<P>
Conservatives must never lose faith in the people, and we must
never lose the faith of the people.  We must look them in the
eye and we must tell them the truth.  Spin doctors should not
be paid to lie, for that way only breeds mistrust.  I believe
a conservative revival is not only possible but vital to the continued
prosperity, discipline and success of advanced societies.  Newt
Gingrich has shown how quickly people will return to our colors
if they are held high and if the army is given a sense of direction.
 For the army to march, for the conservative's recruiting sergeant
to flourish, it needs clear principles, a record of success, a
strategic as well as a tactical purpose.  Only a conservative
agenda can today deliver this.
<P>
The first task of conservatives is to conquer government itself,
to gain some control over the scale and complexity of modern administration.
 Government has to be brought to answer and to bow to the court
of the people.  
<P>
The second task is to cut taxes as the cost of government come
down.  Advanced countries cannot compete with the developing world
if their tills are raided too often by the tax gatherer.
<P>
The third task is to remove obstacles to business success.  We
need freedom from too many rules and regulations so that enterprise
has a chance. Fourth is to ensure that the tax, benefit and legal
systems put families first, buttressing them rather than undermining
them.
<P>
The fifth task is to promote global trade and welcome the third
industrial revolution.  It will generate many more jobs.  It makes
working from home possible.  It could empower the house bound,
liberate the busy, even enliven the bored.  It is more opportunity
than threat.
<P>
Finally, the sixth task is to be true conservatives in protecting
and embellishing all that is best in our different inheritances.
 For Britain, that means the English language, our ancient and
modern noisy democracy, and our great institutions from Oxford
University to Botts Hospital now 900 years young.  For the United
States, that means living up to the sonorous words of Washington,
Jefferson and Lincoln on the rights of man and the pursuit of
happiness.  And for Canada, that means keeping together their
special federation and preserving Canadian identity, for a sense
of belonging matters more today than ever.    
<P>
As conservatives who understand the third industrial revolution,
we are not promising people an end to commercial change.  We cannot
and will not stand like some modern King Kanute and demand that
the software recedes.  We must embrace technological change and
free our people to prosper from it.  But to reassure them, we
must keep alive the flames of our own unique constitutions.  We
must remind people why they belong to families and communities
as well as to the global marketplace.  They gain their security
from the one and their prosperity from the other.  
<P>
Many of you must remind Americans why they should be proud of
America from sea to shining sea.  I must remind my fellow countrymen
why we should be proud to be British with the mother of parliaments
and mother of the free.
<P>
<h3><a name="japan">The Japanese Restoration</a></h3>
<P>
<B>by <a href="#mats">Iwao Matsuda </a></B>
<P>
Revolution is not a word that we Japanese like to use with regard
to our country.  In 1868, when a dynamic group of young reformers
took over the government, abolished feudalism and created the
political, economic and educational institutions of a modern nation
state, they chose the word restoration, not revolution, to describe
what they were doing.  History calls their achievement the Meji
Restoration.  
<P>
Today, when once again Japan needs top to bottom changes in its
political, economic, educational and social institutions, the
key word is reform rather than revolution.  Yet clearly the changes
that Japan requires are revolutionary.  If our program succeeds,
we will have brought about a revolution that will complete what
began with the Meji reformers more than 100 years ago.  It will
embody the most far reaching changes that our country has ever
known and enable us to join the ranks of  the world's normal democratic
states.  
<P>
What is a normal democratic state?  It is first of all a democracy.
 What we have in Japan today is democracy a la Japanese.  We have
the institutional forms of parliamentary government but the circumstance
is rather different from what is regarded as normal in American
and European democracies.  Ours is based on consensus politics
and a mentality that tends to exclude outsiders.  The goal of
the New Frontier Party is to bring about in government alteration
between two political parties that will compete with each other
on the basis of policy, not factions or personalities.  
<P>
For almost the entire post-war period, a single party - the Liberal
Democrats - held exclusive power.  Their monopoly was broken in
July 1993, when a group of reform minded Liberal Democrats rebelled
against the party leadership and established a new party.  I was
one of those Liberals.  Together with other opposition parties,
we won the general election and established a coalition government.
 Yet soon the Liberal Democrats made a deal with their sworn enemies,
the Socialists, and returned to power.  
<P>
To oppose what we regarded as this unholy alliance, all major
opposition parties except the Communists came together in December
1994 to establish the New Frontier Party.  Today, at least in
form, we have the beginning of a two party system.  On one side
stands the government, a coalition of Liberal Democrats, Socialists
and a minor party.  What holds this coalition together?  In my
view, it is a common desire to enjoy the perks  of government
power.  They mouth the slogans of reform but in fact they want
to keep their vested interests.
<P>
By contrast, the New Frontier Party is dedicated to the cause
of change.  We call for wide-ranging changes in politics, in the
economy, in education, in society.  In politics, we were partially
successful during our brief one year in power.  We changed the
election system from one of modified-seat election district to
one which has 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional-representation
seats.  The first election under this system will be held sometime
before the summer of 1997.  It may not immediately bring about
a permanent two party system, but we are convinced that over time
minor parties will fade away.  The present Socialist Party will
be the top candidate for extinction.
<P>
The New Frontier Party's platform calls for clear choices in politics.
 We want to end government by bureaucracy and bring about government
by the people's elected legislators.  We will reduce the number
of ministries from 20 today to 15 after we come to power, and
we will have legislators taking a much more active load in their
ministry.
<P>
Our partnership with the United States is primary (of course with
Canada and England also).  The Cold War has ended but East Asia
remains a dangerous and uncertain place.  China is a huge question
mark, but more unpredictable and therefore more dangerous is North
Korea.  Asia needs the American security presence.  Yet the Japan
we want is one where we assume a much more active partnership
than the existing government.  We will raise our voice louder.
 We may not always agree with the United States, but we will never
forget that we are allies.  We want a permanent seat on the United
Nations Security Council, and we pledge to play a leading role
in its affairs.  The United Nations is far from perfect, but it
is the only international forum we have, and we want to be active
to make it better.  We will not shy away from peace keeping duties.
<P>
At home, we want small government at the center and more power
devolved to local entities. We will have about 300 local authorities
nationwide, small enough to be close to the borders, large enough
to carry out effective government, for which we will replace the
present hodgepodge of 47 prefects and more than 3,200 cities,
towns and villages.
<P>
In the economy, the principal weapon for reform will be deregulation.
 We have no illusions about the difficulty of our task.  Japan
has been a regulated society for more than 1,000 years.  We have
a lot of people, little land, and few natural resources for everyone
to share in an economy of scarcity.  There have to be regulations
and on whole people have accepted these regulations.  In modern
times, the concept of fairness, of equality, has taken precedence
over the concept of individual freedom.  We are a society without
large gaps between rich and poor, management and it's workers.
 We would like to keep it so, but not at the cost of stifling
individual freedom and individual initiative.  We want to experience
the kind of wave that has lifted the American economy and keeps
it far ahead of the others.  That is a wave that does not depend
upon manufacturing production. We need better ideas.  We need
better information.  We need to know how to put information to
work in a more efficient way for each one of us.  In short, we
need freedom.
<P>
I say this is a difficult task because most of us recognize the
need for change.  Many are afraid of living in a society with
few regulations, in a society where each individual will have
to be more self-reliant and take greater responsibility for his
own actions.  Nevertheless, there's no other way for Japan to
move into the 21st century and survive unless people become convinced
that the only alternative to deregulation is continued decline
and eventual extinction.
<P>
Educational reform may be the most important of the reforms we
propose.  Universal education involves one of the great achievements
of the Meji reformers.  Japan today is one of the world's most
literate nations, but our education remains in the 19th Century.
 It emphasizes rote line, stuffing the student with all sorts
of relevant and irrelevant information which he can regurgitate
in written examinations.  We need education that will foster self-reliance
and individual creativity.  The primary emphasis must be allowing
the individual to develop.  Education is an area which we may
not see results for 10 years or more, but we must begin now for
we are already far behind the leaders in this field.  
<P>
Underlying all these reforms is a need for a change in society
itself. How do we move from decisions by consensus into the essence
of democracy?  This is a making by the majority.  Ultimately,
we can only achieve our goals by a revolution within each individual
consciousness.  That takes time, but that is a task to which we
have dictated ourselves.
<P>
<h3><a name="three">The Three Revolutions</a></h3>
<P>
<B>by <a href="#mann">Preston Manning </a></B>
<P>
Our subject is a world in revolution.  Reformation might be the
gentler word.  Perhaps we can talk about revolution through reformation;
that's the Canadian way of seeking the middle. I begin by asking,
which revolution are we talking about? I ask this because it seems
to me there are several revolutions going on in the world at the
same time, and it is important to distinguish them and to think
through the relationship between them.  
<P>
The first revolution is the conservative revolution, the rejection
of Socialism, of liberal interventionism, of the ideology of the
master state in favor of market based solutions to economic problems,
of more personal responsibility for social security, balanced
budgets and limited governments. Examples, of course, of this
revolution are the factory example in Great Britain and the Contract
with America, a program of the new Republicans here in Washington.
 
<P>
In my country, Canada, this conservative revolution is also in
progress, but proceeding more slowly and sporadically, which is
the Canadian way.  We start, of course, with revolution; is it
a provincial or federal responsibility? At the provincial level
it is being led by conservative parties in the Province of Alberta
and the Province of Ontario, but at the national level the federal
Conservative Party has virtually disappeared.  Therefore, at the
national level the conservative revolution is being managed or
mismanaged by a pragmatic liberal administration that is not at
all enthusiastic about leading such a revolution but is being
pushed along by a third party, namely, the Reform Party.  If all
of this sounds confusing, it is, but it arises from the fact that
we Canadians are extreme moderates and tend to protect ourselves
from the excesses of revolutions by entrusting their management
to people who do not believe in them.  
<P>
So that's a synopsis of the conservative revolution that is in
progress in our country, but there is another revolution which
is going on in the world at the same time. There have been allusions
to it by other speakers, and this I will refer to as the structural
revolution, and in my country, this revolution is as pronounced
as the conservative revolution.  
<P>
The structural revolution has two conflicting components.  On
the one hand it is characterized by the removal of the internal
and external barriers to trade, the aggregation of local and provincial
economies into national economies, and then the aggregation of
those national economies and identities into larger global structures
like the North American Free Trade Area, the European Union or
the Asia Pacific Economic Community.  At the same time that the
aggregation into bigger and bigger units is going on, of course,
more and more people and more and more countries want to affirm
and exercise more local and personal control over social services
and cultural policies that directly affect the quality of their
own lives and their cultural and personal identities.  Thus, in
that respect, they identify more with smaller and more homogeneous
units of political organization - local governments and communities
- based often on regional or racial or linguistic or cultural
distinctiveness.  
<P>
In Canada, therefore, at the same time that our national economy
is being integrated into the North American global economy, this
structural revolution manifests itself in the form of regional
alienation in western Canada, Quebec separatism, talk of maritime
union in our atlantic provinces, provincial premiers demanding
more decentralization of federal power, and large municipalities
contemplating city-state status.  In other words, the ground behind
Canada, and I'd suggest many other countries, is moving in two
different directions, like the big crustal plates that geologists
tell us are the cause of earthquakes.
<P>
The challenge of governments includes the challenge of designing
structures capable of absorbing those stresses and strains. Five
years ago, the alignment of political parties in the Canadian
Parliament that could have been described on the traditional left-right-center
axis. Today it could be just as well described as consisting of
traditional federalists - mainly liberals - defending the old
nation-state structure, separatists from Quebec seeking extreme
devolution, and new federalists - reformers - seeking to create
the more flexible federal state that can handle both of these
forces in the 21st century.  
<P>
Perhaps both the conservative revolution and the structural revolution
are simply aspects of a broader revolution, the democratic revolution.
 For me it is this democratic revolution which is the ultimate
revolution and which should end up being the distinguishing revolution
of our times.  All over the world, ordinary people are seeking
to get more control in their own hands or in the hands of institutions
they can influence over the facts that most directly affect the
quality and content of their lives.  Thus they will support the
conservative revolution to the extent that it limits the spending
and taxing powers of governments and leaves more dollars in the
pockets of citizens, if this is done equitably.  They will support
the conservative revolution to the extent that it redresses the
intrusiveness of the liberal, social policy state, provided the
old intrusions are not replaced by new intrusions.
<P>
Public support for the structural revolution, for enlarging markets
to stimulate economic growth, to create better jobs for people
with higher incomes, and public support for strengthening the
power of local government at the expense of larger and more distant
governments, is also it seems to me a manifestation of this broader
democratic revolution. If those larger and more distant governments
necessary to manage our national and international affairs are
to retain their legitimacy, they must take steps both to facilitate
a new division of powers between themselves and the lower levels
of government and they themselves must become more democratic,
more representative, more accountable and more responsive to the
people that they serve.
<P>
I am personally supportive of the general direction of the conservative
revolution and the structural revolution, but I believe that their
success or failure will ultimately be measured by the extent to
which they serve the cause of the democratic revolution, a democratic
revolution which I suggest is happening in Canada and virtually
every other country in the world.

<h2>Taking a Byte out of Disability</h2>
<b>by John Hood</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While cleaning up the hard disk on my computer recently, I came 
across an accessory that I had never noticed before called "Text to Speech." Intrigued, I opened it and 
discovered that my relatively low-end computer could convert standard text files into speech. It can read 
aloud whatever I wish, from a brief newspaper column to a massive document.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The voice sounds very much like the one you hear throughout A Brief 
History of Time, a movie based on the book by scientist Stephen Hawking. Struck down by a debilitating 
illness that robbed him of speech and most of his mobility, Hawking has nevertheless become the world's 
most celebrated physicist and cosmologist. His extraordinary accomplishments were made possible by 
technologies that allow him to operate a computer -- and even, through it, to speak to movie audiences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's amazing to me is not that such technologies exist, but that they 
are so commonplace as to be installed in a run-of-the-mill personal computer like mine. In fact, 
inexpensive programs and devices have dramatically expanded the economic opportunities of disabled 
Americans, not only improving their own lives but allowing all of us to benefit from previously untapped 
talents and resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mark Beckwith of Greenville, Maine, is a quadriplegic. But he is also a 
draftsman for the Log Home Co., thanks to innovative products from a Massachusetts firm called Dragon 
Systems. For less than a thousand dollars, you can purchase DragonDictate and run sophisticated computer 
programs by voice. The system converts each word it hears into text by piecing together the word's 
components and then comparing the combination with acoustic models in its built-in vocabulary list. By 
speaking key commands such as "Shift-Alt-F4," the user can operate spreadsheets, word processors, and 
even the drafting programs that Beckwith uses to design house-building plans.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other low-cost computer devices that aid disabled users include screen-
magnification software ($200 to $600), Braille-output printers and translators ($2,100 to $4,000), and 
head-pointer or Morse-code systems that allow severely disabled people to issue computer commands 
($500 to $1,400).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Toward the opposite end of the cost scale is another product that helps 
quadriplegics accomplish tasks, called EyeGaze. Developed by LC Technologies in Fairfax, Virginia, it 
allows users to turn on appliances, run machinery, type letters, and play video games with eye movements. 
The device uses beams of light to translate movements into computer commands. Even at a price of 
$25,000, EyeGaze offers many seriously disabled people opportunities they never thought they had.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The market for products to enable physically handicapped workers -- 
ranging from speech synthesis and voice-input systems to robotics, deaf relays, Braille text displays, text 
telephones, monitoring devices, and environmental controls -- includes such major players as IBM, AT&T, 
Xerox, Nynex, Digital Equipment, and Apple. Thought of more broadly, products ranging from 
pharmaceuticals to ergonomic office furniture are also part of this effort to empower the disabled. Prozac 
and other antidepressants have helped many workers keep their jobs and improve their performance. Pain 
relievers allow employees with arthritis and similar ailments to perform work without enduring 
excruciating pain. Redesigned desks, chairs, and other equipment have done the same for those with 
chronic back problems, who make up about 15 percent of all people considered "disabled."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many observers who have taken notice of American businesses' 
interest in this market have attributed it to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), enacted in 1990 and 
fully implemented in 1994. The ADA, among other things, requires businesses with 15 or more employees 
to give "equal access" to all disabled workers and consumers. Portrayed as a civil-rights measure no less 
important than the 1960s legislation against racial discrimination, the ADA may have attracted the 
attention of some firms that otherwise wouldn't have entered the market for disabled-enabling products. 
But its overall effect on the employability of the disabled is a great deal more complicated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For one thing, the ADA has mainly affected not hiring but firing. In its 
first two years, about half of all ADA claims involved alleged wrongful discharges, while only 12 percent 
charged discrimination in hiring disabled workers. In one case, a senior executive with terminal brain 
cancer who had been fired was awarded $222,000 because his employer could not prove in court that he 
was unable to perform the essential functions of his job. In all too many cases, it appears, workers 
discharged for a variety of reasons have added the ADA to their other legal means of obtaining large 
severance payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Second, the targeted beneficiaries of the ADA include very few of the 
seriously disabled Americans that both proponents and opponents of the law tend to talk about. About half 
a million Americans are wheelchair bound, but almost 50 million Americans are considered "disabled" for 
the purposes of the ADA. They include those with relatively minor physical or mental infirmities. And they 
make up the vast majority of plaintiffs in ADA lawsuits alleging wrongful termination.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Third, the ADA may actually hinder rather than advance opportunities 
for disabled workers. It's harder to prove discrimination in hiring than wrongful termination -- that's why 
lawsuits alleging the latter are so much more common. Rather than face the potential legal consequences of 
letting a disabled worker go, even for perfectly appropriate reasons, some employers may well want to 
limit their exposure to such suits by not hiring the disabled in the first place, accepting the risk of 
noncompliance on the hiring side in order to avoid the much greater risk of wrongful termination suits. 
And their caution may be vindicated by the rash of spurious ADA claims by people claiming to be disabled 
by obesity, kleptomania, sex addiction, severe body odor, and "multiple chemical sensitivity." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact is that efforts to expand opportunities for disabled people far 
predates the ADA. The term "disabled" is itself relative, meaningful only according to the tasks one wants 
to perform and the technology available to help one do so. We now have more people living with physical 
and mental infirmities than ever before. In the past, those born with birth defects often didn't make it past 
infancy. Injuries that today lead to loss of limbs or motor control used to be deadly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On the other hand, the number of people who are functionally disabled, 
especially as it relates to employment, is surely lower. For most of human history, persons lacking nimble 
fingers or strong backs had little prospect of making a living. The advent of farm implements and simple 
devices such as looms increased the number of people who could perform work quickly and easily, thus 
increasing the standard-of-living for all. Similarly, until the invention of eyeglasses, an enormous number 
of human beings became virtually unemployable at an early age.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Thanks to modern machinery and appliances, many jobs no longer 
require great physical strength and endurance. Now, the Information Age promises to expand the 
boundaries of human potential even further, as the mind -- not the body -- becomes the most valuable asset 
a worker or entrepreneur can bring to the marketplace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is true even for the hardest cases. Researchers at Rutgers and 
Princeton universities have found that computers have significantly enhanced job opportunities and 
boosted earnings for many people with spinal-cord injuries. The researchers found that, all else held equal, 
people who have computer skills at the time of their injuries generally return to work more quickly than 
those without such skills. They also discovered that disabled workers with computer skills suffer no 
disparity in pay versus their counterparts without disabilities, while those without such skills do get paid 
less.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Modern computer technologies are mostly the product of competitive 
private markets, not government programs or regulations. By decisively shifting the source of economic 
value to ideas and away from physical exertion, computers and other information technologies have helped 
Americans with serious disabilities far more than has the ADA. Indeed, while the percentage of the 
disabled who are employed rose, especially among women, in the 20 years preceding the passage of the 
law, it has since leveled off. The National Organization on Disabilities studied the issue in 1986 and again 
in 1994, finding that the percentage of working disabled stayed roughly the same, given the margin of 
sampling error: 33 percent in 1986 versus 31 percent in 1994. Of course, there could be many explanations 
for this, but as Brian Doherty of Reason magazine concluded, "there is certainly no evidence, despite all 
the costs, that the ADA has helped" the disabled gain employment.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Private firms have incentives to develop, manufacture, and market 
products to empower disabled workers regardless of government regulation. There is already significant 
consumer demand for these items. The disabled want them to improve their own prospects and quality of 
life. And their potential employers have an incentive to create jobs for the most talented and hard-working 
individuals. Long before the advent of the ADA, companies such as Du Pont and Marriott discovered that 
efficiently accommodating the needs of disabled workers can boost performance and employee morale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Many employees with disabilities have really overcome many 
obstacles to being successfully employed and have shown lots of perseverance and creativity in showing 
how a job can be done," says Lana Smart of the National Center for Disability Services.
Indeed, there is an important qualitative difference between the way regulators approach workplace 
disability and the way private firms and individuals do. For regulators, the disabled represent a cost that 
must be imposed on unwilling businesses. In the private market for labor, however, finding ways to 
unleash the creative talents of the disabled can yield significant returns for firms, workers, and consumers. 
The disabled are viewed as potentially valuable assets, rather than potentially costly liabilities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It may be true that some severely disabled individuals cannot be 
profitably employed today, because the costs of doing so exceed the value of the work they can do. But 
they used to think that about the nearsighted, the slender-bodied, and the club-footed. It must not be 
forgotten that people have always found ways to eliminate those barriers to employment, without the 
prodding of government regulators.

<h2>En Banc Hearing on Spectrum Allocation</h2>
<b>Before the Federal Communications Commission</b><P>
Statement of <a href="/pff/people/afellow.html#Pitsch">Peter K. Pitsch</a>
<P><br>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
The overarching goal in managing the electromagnetic spectrum
should be to maximize its value to the American people. As in
other areas of our economy, the best means of achieving efficient
use of this resource is to rely principally on market forces.
<P>
There are three fundamental problems with the current system.
They span the 60-year history of <a href="http://www.fcc.gov">the FCC</a> and continue to this
day. They are systemic. One, the FCC like other central planners
lacks the information necessary to make efficient decisions. Two,
the administrative process has been used by special interests
to delay competition and innovation. Three, the current system
has held fallow or underutilized a substantial portion of the
spectrum for government purposes.
<P>
The simple solution to the current spectrum gridlock is to give
existing and new spectrum users more operational and technical
flexibility to use their spectrum the way they see fit so long
as they do not interfere with their cochannel and adjacent channel
&quot;neighbors.&quot; Once a licensee is given the freedom to
use its spectrum for a broad range of uses, the licensee has a
strong economic incentive to consider the relative merits of alternative
uses. The more flexibility the licensee has, the more likely it
is that its use will be the highest and best use reflecting the
spectrum's true opportunity cost to society. 
<P>
In <a href="/pff/telecom_revolution.html">&quot;The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity,&quot;</a>
the Progress &amp; Freedom working group (of which I am a member)
proposed two fundamental spectrum reforms. First, unallocated
private sector spectrum and underutilized government spectrum
should be made available to private users. The spectrum should
be structured in highly flexible parcels with minimal government
constraints. These parcels should give the legal protection and
freedoms that attach to property, viz., technical and operational
freedom, protection from trespass or unlawful takings, and the
ability to assign, lease or sell. Where there are mutually exclusive
bids for these new parcels, winners should be selected by auctions.
<P>
The second way to achieve spectrum reform is to deregulate or
privatize existing spectrum users. As with the newly allocated
spectrum, the Congress should move to give existing users full
flexibility to use their spectrum subject to interference and
international treaty constraints. Licensees should be encouraged
to negotiate with their &quot;neighbors&quot; to reach mutually
beneficial agreements on possible new uses of their spectrum.

<P>
The time has come for the FCC to dramatically reform the spectrum
process. Spectrum gridlock is a primary obstacle to the full exploitation
of the computer revolution. Few things will promote wireless computer
applications and local telephone competition as much as driving
down the cost of spectrum by several orders of magnitude. A centrally-planned,
government-run allocation system probably never made sense. It
has cost Americans billions of dollars in foregone wealth and
prosperity, but the accelerating pace of technical change and
the increasing complexity of the spectrum allocation decisions
that have to be made make the case for dramatic reform more compelling
than ever before.
<P>
<B>Testimony</B>
<P>
It is an honor to have this opportunity to speak before the Federal
Communications Commission on one of the most important telecommunications
opportunities facing America--reforming our management of the
electromagnetic spectrum. I do not come recently to this issue.
I was in the thick of FCC deliberations on spectrum policy in
the 1980s, first as Chief of the FCC's Office of Plans &amp; Policy
for Chairman Mark Fowler and second as Chief of Staff to Chairman
Dennis Patrick. During those years I strongly espoused reforms
that would give licensees more technical and operational control
over how they use their spectrum and the use of auctions for initial
assignments where there are mutually exclusive applications. Since
then I have consulted for various telecom companies on spectrum
and other FCC-related issues.
<P>
Most recently, I and several other analysts from a wide range
of think tanks helped write The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation's
report on the FCC, &quot;The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity.&quot;
In it, we recommended privatizing spectrum management.
<P>
The overarching goal in managing the electromagnetic spectrum
should be to maximize its value to the American people. As in
the rest of our economy, the best means of achieving efficient
use of the spectrum is to rely principally on market forces. In
my brief remarks today, I would like to catalog various types
of failure systemic to the current centrally-planned, government-run
spectrum regime, then identify the two ways in which spectrum
reform can be achieved, and lastly spend a few moments discussing
the tremendous importance of spectrum reform to America's economic
and competitive prospects.
<P>
There are three fundamental problems with the current system.
They span the 60-year history of the FCC and continue to this
day. They are systemic. One, the FCC like other central planners
lacks the information necessary to make efficient decisions. Two,
the administrative process has been used by special interests
to delay competition and innovation. Three, the current system
has held fallow or underutilized a substantial portion of the
spectrum for government purposes.
<P>
First, determining efficient use is a complex task requiring vast
amounts of continually updated information that is hopelessly
beyond the abilities of an administrative process. Markets, of
course, &quot;parallel-process&quot; information gathered by millions
of businesses and consumers to continually provide price signals
on the relative usefulness of the myriad competing demands and
uses of spectrum. In the case of spectrum, the information required
to make the necessary tradeoffs is greater than in most other
areas of the economy, because the pace of technological development
has created a raft of new uses for &quot;wireless&quot; communications
and new ways in which spectrum can be efficiently deployed. The
comparative advantage of markets is greater in such dynamic situations.
<P>
As a result, the FCC has consistently made simplistic and overly
rigid decisions that misallocated spectrum, created inefficient
industry structures, and locked in outdated technical standards.
For example, in the 1950s the FCC dramatically underallocated
spectrum to VHF television reducing the availability of television
channels and impeding the development of a third, fourth and fifth
national television network. In the 1970s it long delayed and
then underallocated spectrum to cellular mobile telephony, creating
only two cellular companies. This delay alone cost America $85
billion dollars. Time and again it imposed a nationwide grid that
did not account for local differences--underallocating forestry
spectrum in Idaho and overallocating it in New York City and vice
versa for taxicab spectrum. Finally, the FCC locked in an analog
technical standard for cellular telephony that was 20 years old
and out of date by the time the FCC got around to assigning cellular
licenses.
<P>
The second systemic failure of the current spectrum regime is
its susceptibility to capture by special interests opposed to
innovation and competition. In the face of political pressure,
the FCC has again and again delayed the allocation of spectrum
to innovative new services. Examples include Direct Broadcast
Television, so called &quot;wireless cable&quot;, low power TV,
VHF drop ins, and new FM channels. Few companies and no trade
association can resist the temptation to use the current regulatory
scheme to disadvantage new competition or innovation. H.L. Mencken's
quip applies with full force, &quot;It may be a sin to think evil
of others, but it is seldom a mistake.&quot; The sad reality is
that in this &quot;regulatory game&quot;, the established concentrated
economic interests typically triumph over the amorphous and diffuse
interests of consumers.
<P>
The FCC's &quot;public interest&quot; regulation of spectrum has
been used as a weapon against consumers. Regulated companies frequently
have embraced special public interest obligations in exchange
for protection from competitors and innovation. This &quot;taxation
by regulation&quot; by unelected regulators, followed by the inevitable
<B>quid pro quo</B>, has been extremely costly to consumers. Any
such deals should be made explicitly and only by Congress.
<P>
The third systemic failure of the current system of spectrum management
is the underutilization of spectrum by the government sector.
While there is some debate on how much spectrum is effectively
denied to the private sector, there can be little doubt that it
is in absolute terms a huge amount. Many governmental uses of
spectrum are vital; others are not. All of these uses should be
justified economically. Today government users of spectrum have
access to spectrum at far less cost than that available to non
government users. Recall that in the recent PCS auctions the winners
paid over $7 billion for 60 MHz of PCS spectrum. Moreover, because
government users do not operate under a profit incentive and often
have difficulty funding the use of new spectrum efficient technology,
they are probably far less efficient than private users.
<P>
The simple solution to the current spectrum gridlock is to give
existing and new spectrum users more operational and technical
flexibility to use their spectrum the way they see fit so long
as they do not interfere with their cochannel and adjacent channel
&quot;neighbors.&quot; The logic of this reform is easily illustrated.
Typically, a licensee has two choices: (1) use its spectrum for
a narrow purpose with the specific technology that the FCC has
designated or (2) give it back to the FCC. Given this choice,
the current spectrum use will be economic to the licensee as long
as it has any positive value. In economic terms the &quot;opportunity
cost&quot; of the spectrum to the licensee is zero. The cost to
society, of course, is the most valuable alternative use that
is foregone. Importantly, technological developments and the elimination
of other regulatory barriers has been dramatically increasing
the value of these alternative uses.
<P>
Once a licensee is given the freedom to use its spectrum for a
broad range of uses, however, the licensee has a strong economic
incentive to consider the relative merits of alternative uses.
The more flexibility the licensee has, the more likely it is that
its use will be the highest and best use reflecting the spectrum's
true opportunity cost to society.
<P>
In &quot;The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity,&quot;
the Progress &amp; Freedom working group proposed a four-part
plan to reform spectrum management. For sake of brevity, this
plan can be reduced to two mechanisms. First, the FCC should make
unallocated private sector spectrum and underutilized government
spectrum available to private users. The spectrum should be structured
in highly flexible parcels with minimal government constraints.
These parcels should give the legal protection and freedoms that
attach to property, viz., technical and operational freedom, protection
from trespass or unlawful takings, and the ability to assign,
lease or sell. Of course, these new users should be subject to
antitrust and other laws that apply to businesses generally. Where
there are mutually exclusive bids for these new parcels, winners
should be selected by auctions. The use of simultaneous multiple
round auctions should allow users to aggregate spectrum (both
in bandwidth and geographically) to reduce the costs of introducing
equipment, resolving interference disputes, and marketing a new
service.
<P>
A few words about auctions are in order. They are the most efficient
means of assigning licenses where there are mutually exclusive
applicants for three reasons. First, they make assignments more
quickly than administrative hearings and lotteries. A three-year
delay imposed by comparative hearings or lotteries can easily
wipe out a full one-fourth of the present value of the license.
Second, they assign the spectrum to those who are most likely
to put it to its highest valued use. Third, they make these assignments
at less cost to society. Instead of using scarce resources in
expensive lotteries and comparative hearings, applicants compete
by adding zeros to the size of the transfer payment they are willing
to make to the government.
<P>
Note that the primary value of auctions is not that they raise
money for the government. Care should be taken that auctions do
not become an obstacle to the principal goal of reducing spectrum
scarcity. Spectrum should be released as rapidly and efficiently
as possible, even if that reduces the government's auction proceeds,
because the goal is to free up spectrum for the benefit of the
American economy. Indeed, if the FCC is doing its job right auction
prices for comparable parcels of spectrum should fall over time.
<P>
The second way to achieve spectrum reform is to deregulate or
privatize existing spectrum users. As with the newly allocated
spectrum, the FCC should move to give existing users full flexibility
to use their spectrum subject to interference and international
treaty constraints. Licensees should be encouraged to negotiate
with their &quot;neighbors&quot; to reach mutually beneficial
agreements on possible new uses of their spectrum. This approach
creates a private incentive to &quot;reallocate&quot; spectrum
and take on the vested interests that can be counted to oppose
new competition and innovation. (Evan Kwerel and John Williams
of the FCC have illustrated one way in which this approach could
be used in the UHF spectrum.) Likewise, the government agencies
should be encouraged to sell or sublease their spectrum to the
private sector.
<P>
Those who see privatizing existing spectrum as a government &quot;giveaway&quot;
miss the point. The existing users have for the most part purchased
their spectrum in the resale market. It is not fair, efficient
or politically feasible to require them to pay for their spectrum
again. Furthermore, top down grants of flexible spectrum will
be difficult because the existing users will collectively oppose
the release of hundreds of MHz in flexible allocations. Privatizing
existing spectrum will create a competition among existing licensees
to move &quot;beach front&quot; spectrum from its current &quot;land
dump&quot; uses. In this parlance, the current &quot;beach property
owners&quot; may not appreciate these efforts, but they will not
be able to stop them. Indeed, they might well choose to join them.
In the end, America's &quot;beach-consuming public&quot; will
benefit.
<P>
It should be noted that these approaches do not require all or
nothing. You can do them in degree. In fact the Commission, under
Chairmen Fowler, Patrick, Sikes and Hundt, has increasingly utilized
the concepts of flexibility and private negotiation. Examples
include giving cellular licensees flexibility, allowing ITFS licensees
to lease spectrum to wireless cable operators, allowing FM radio
stations to use their subcarriers for paging and other uses, allowing
PCS licensees to buy out microwave licensees in their license
areas, opening the eligibility of SMRS licensees, and consolidating
land mobile pools. Working within the limits of the administrative
process and the current law has been a difficult task and they
and their fellow commissioners and many key staffers deserve credit
for what they have done.
<P>
The time has come, however, for the FCC to dramatically speed
up this process. A centrally-planned, government-run allocation
system probably never made sense. It has cost Americans billions
of dollars in foregone wealth and prosperity, but the accelerating
pace of technical change and the increasing complexity of the
spectrum allocation decisions that have to be made make the case
for dramatic reform more compelling than ever before.
<P>
We are all familiar with the rapid change in the computer industry.
In the space of five years, <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a> lost roughly $70 billion dollars
of market capitalization. In the same period, many small hardware
and software companies grew exponentially, more than offsetting
those mainframe losses. Who can seriously question the likelihood
that if <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a>, <a href="http://www.compaq.com">Compaq</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> had required FCC spectrum
to get to the market, the personal computer revolution would have
been postponed.
<P>
In the same way, spectrum gridlock is a primary obstacle to the
full exploitation of the computer revolution. Few things will
promote wireless computer applications and local telephone competition
as much as driving down the cost of spectrum by several orders
of magnitude. Fundamental spectrum reform would build on the U.S.'s
current but perishable lead in the global digital derby. America
is positioned to leave other countries in a cloud of silicon dust.
A regulatory framework that slows innovation in this area, despite
any plausible shortrun efficiency gains it might achieve, will
foreclose a tremendous opportunity for the American people.

<TITLE>On the Road to Digital Freedom -- PFF

<a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<br>
<h2>On the Road to Digital Freedom</h2>
<P>

The Telecommunications Act of  1996 (TCA) represents the most
sweeping reform of telecommunications law in more than 60 years.
 In principle, the new legislation will enable local telephone
companies, long distance companies, cable TV companies, direct
broadcast satellite providers, over-the-air broadcasters, cellular
companies and a host of others to compete against one another
to provide all sorts of communications and information services
in the converging market for digital information and information
technology.  The potential benefits for consumers and for America's
position in the world are beyond calculation.
<P>
The key word in the previous sentence, however, is <I>potential</I>.
 As some commentators have noted, TCA is not, in and of itself,
a deregulatory bill.  Indeed, it mandates over 80 new rulemakings
by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and delegates
significant authority to state regulators.  If the FCC and the
states use their authority to reduce regulation and encourage
competition, TCA can lead to an efficient, deregulated regime
for the new digital information marketplace and put America on
the road to digital freedom.
<P>
But TCA does not mandate such a result.  In most cases, it gives
the FCC and the states authority to deregulate, but it does not
require that they do so.  For example:
<UL>
<LI>Regulators will oversee the opening of local telephone markets
to competition.  Along the way they will have to address many
difficult technical and economic issues including interconnection,
unbundling, number portability, resale, dialing parity and right-of-way
access.  The nature and pace of the transition is left largely
to regulatory discretion.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Regulators will also implement very broad provisions designed
to change dramatically the current system of &quot;universal service&quot;
subsidies, aiming to target them more to low income households,
collect them in a competitively-neutral fashion and otherwise
reduce them where possible.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 provides that the FCC &quot;shall
forbear&quot; from regulating where public interest criteria are
met.  How the FCC uses its discretion in implementing this provision
will have a dramatic impact on the pace of deregulation.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The final days of legislative debate spotlighted the importance
of issues associated with the electromagnetic spectrum.  In coming
months, both the FCC and Congress will consider how current spectrum
management practices should be reformed.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The smoothness and even success of the transition to a competitive
digital marketplace will depend upon how well these issues are
handled.  The consequences for America's future are enormous:
 
<UL>
<LI>Digital information products and services are the most rapidly
growing segment of the world economy, expected to account for
$1 trillion or more in sales by the year 2000.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Technological advances in these areas are the driving force
behind a global transition from an industrial age economy to an
information age economy, literally transforming every aspect of
the world economy, and society itself.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The social consequences of the transition are profound, and
implementation of TCA will have profound consequences for how
digital technologies are made available to all segments of the
population.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>America's leadership in the world, and ultimately its national
security, are dependent on continuing its leadership role in information
technology. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<h3>The Working Group</h3>

<P>
Early last year House Telecom Subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields
asked the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation for its recommendations
on reforming the Federal Communications Commission.  PFF assembled
a &quot;working group&quot; of top-flight telecom experts and
scholars, many of whom had been senior staffers at the FCC for
several years.  The working group includes:
<UL>
<LI>Dr. Robert Crandall, Brookings Institution;
<LI>Dr. Jeffrey Eisenach, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>James Gattuso, Esq., Citizens For A Sound Economy;
<LI>Dr. Thomas Hazlett, University of California, Davis;
<LI>Peter W. Huber, Manhattan Institute;
<LI>Dr. George A. Keyworth, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>Dr. Thomas Lenard, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>William C. Myers, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>Peter Pitsch, Esq., Hudson Institute;
<LI>Kenneth Robinson, Esq.;
<LI>Gregory Sidak, Esq., American Enterprise Institute; and

Last May, the working group produced  a replacement model for
the FCC entitled <I>The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity</I>.
 This report outlined an approach for eliminating much of the
current regulatory apparatus and replacing the FCC with a smaller,
leaner oversight agency designed to promote competition.   The
working group report played an important role in educating public
policy leaders and members of the public about the nature of the
transition to a digital environment, and served as the focus of
PFF testimony before both Congress and the FCC; members of the
working group met with leaders in both Houses of Congress on numerous
occasions to brief them on their findings.
<P>
In 1996, Congress has again turned to the working group, with
the chairs of the major oversight committees in both Houses requesting
specific assistance from PFF with respect to issues ranging from
spectrum management, to forebearance, to the structure of the
FCC itself.  FCC Chairman Reed Hundt has also sought PFF's input
and advice.
<P>
<h3>The Project and its Activities</h3>

<P>
PFF's May 1995 report concluded that the pace of technological
change has fundamentally changed the political economy of regulation.
 Innovation has made effective competition possible throughout
the telecom market.  It has also dramatically increased the cost
of regulatory delays and impediments.  The FCC needed to be replaced
by a new, smaller, more focused agency.  
<P>
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has provided the means and
added impetus for achieving this goal.  The new legislation requires
state and federal regulators to assure that a competitive 14-point
checklist of conditions are met in local exchange markets, before
allowing the regional Bell operating companies to enter the in-region
long distance and equipment manufacturing markets.  The implementation
of the interconnection, network unbundling, and related pricing
issues will be major battlegrounds.  This process is important
to the efficient development of local telecommunications competition
and the expeditious development of additional competition in long
distance and equipment markets.  
<P>
Fashioning universal service reforms will present a stiff political
challenge.  Many interests will press for the expansion of the
definition of universal service.  If these subsidies are not reduced
and targeted, a competitively-neutral system that does not impede
new technology will be difficult to achieve.  The legislation
sets forward specific universal service principles to be observed,
but also gives the FCC considerable latitude to reform the system.
 A convincing record and strategy will be needed to carry out
true reform. 
<P>
To free up needed administrative resources and eliminate counterproductive
regulation, the FCC will need to forbear from regulating in many
areas.  Suitable areas for deregulation will need to be identified
and justified.  At the same time, the FCC will be wrestling with
a raft of other issues ranging from antenna preemption to video
services provided by telephone companies. 
<P>
The legislation has also created an enormous opportunity for the
FCC to spur local telephone competition and the development of
 new wireless services by making more spectrum available through
market mechanisms.  Practical ways of dealing with interference
and other objections to &quot;dezoning&quot; the spectrum will
need to be developed.  Alternative mechanisms of freeing up spectrum,
such as variants of the PCS overlay approach and a more &quot;bottom-up&quot;
approach used in the case of Nextel, will need to be closely examined
and appraised.
<P>
In short, much more detailed work will be needed to effect a smooth
transition to a truly competitive digital information marketplace.
 The updated FCC replacement project will provide a detailed plan
of action building on the new legislation, focusing both on the
implementation of TCA and the need for additional legislation
to further speed the transition.  Given TCA's reliance on devolution
to the states, a telecommunications model for state law and regulation
will also be developed.  Specifically, <I>On The Road to Digital
Freedom</I> will provide important research in six main areas:
<UL>
<LI>The FCC role in creating competitive market conditions in
local telecommunications markets;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The FCC role in assuring universal service goals are met;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Spectrum management reforms that could be undertaken by the
FCC or legislated by Congress;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Specific areas in which the FCC should forbear from regulating;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Specific areas of FCC regulation that Congress should eliminate
or transfer to other agencies; and,
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The role and specific direction the states should take in
speeding the transition to a competitive digital marketplace.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The project will produce three major written products and three
related events.
<P>
A draft update of the replacement model for the FCC will be produced
by mid-April, 1996.  This first effort will focus on spectrum
and forbearance issues and be timed to inform expected hearings
in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on spectrum and
FCC restructuring issues.  It will provide the basis for a PFF
strategic summit in mid-April on the implications of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996.  
<P>
The final draft of the FCC replacement report will be completed
by July 1996, prior to Congress' August recess and the Foundation's
August Aspen Summit, at which the report will be presented and
debated.  
<P>
Finally, an expanded stand-alone report on state regulatory issues
will be completed by November 1996 and released in time to inform
state legislative deliberations in 1997.  State telecommunications
licensing and regulation recommendations will be presented to
state legislative leaders at a winter workshop, perhaps hosted
in conjunction with the American Legislative Exchange Council.
<P>
In addition to these reports and events, the Foundation will maintain
a site on the Internet, at which key issues will be presented
and debated; will arrange expert testimony before appropriate
state and Congressional legislative committees, upon request;
issue Progress on Point alerts, as appropriate; and otherwise
inform the national debate on telecommunications and information
technology policy.
<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation will provide overall direction
for the project and will have ultimate responsibility for the
final product.  From PFF, the project team will include Dr. George
A. Keyworth, II, Chairman; Dr. Jeffrey Eisenach, President; William
Myers, Vice President for Policy; and Dr. Thomas Lenard, Senior
Fellow and Director of Regulatory Studies.  Peter Pitsch, Esq.,
now an adjunct fellow at PFF, will direct the project.  Participation
of other working group members is expected to provide input on
all important aspects of the project.

<h2>In the Trenches of A City's War on Poverty</h2>
<b>by Kim A. Lawton</b>
<p><p><P></center>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For Marcia, release from a California prison was 
both a blessing and a curse: She suddenly had to figure out how to care for herself and her infant 
son. An abuser of heroin and cocaine for more than 20 years, she had few job skills or prospects. 
She had been on welfare, but balked at returning to that treadmill. And if she checked into a drug 
treatment program, she probably would be separated from her baby. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I knew that I was going to begin using [drugs] again . . 
. and I knew that I didn't want to do that," says Marcia, who asked not to be fully identified. "I 
just was tired of it all." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then she heard about House of Grace, a residential 
program in San Jose for abused, homeless, or addicted women. It is one of the few recovery 
programs in the county that allows mothers to stay with their children. As soon as Marcia and her 
son moved into the program's renovated apartment complex in December 1994, house director 
Denise Lutcher got actively involved in her life. Lutcher and her staff went to work assessing 
Marcia's physical, emotional, vocational, and spiritual needs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For residents like Marcia, that list of needs is 
usually long. Women receive counseling, attend recovery classes, complete their education, and 
learn life skills such as managing a budget and caring for their children. But they must also 
follow a clear set of rules. They must wean themselves from welfare and other government aid 
within six months. They are permitted no televisions or telephones in their rooms. A resident 
who fails her weekly drug test just once faces immediate expulsion. And the women must attend 
Bible classes and chapel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The program helped me to get a hold of my life 
because of the tools they teach," says Marcia. Today, at 42, she is entering the final phases of her 
recovery program at the House of Grace. She has enrolled in a local college, where she is earning 
top grades in a program on computing and information systems. She holds a part-time job. Her 
son, now two, is flourishing in a community with other stable parents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	House of Grace typifies the strategy -- and the 
success -- of a community-based and religiously rooted approach to helping the urban poor. It is 
one of several programs set up by CityTeam Ministries, a private, nondenominational Christian 
agency working in the inner city of San Jose. Last year, CityTeam administered a budget of $7 
million and a staff of nearly a hundred, and provided intensive, on-going help to more than 5,000 
individuals and families -- all without a dollar of public funds. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As noted in a recent Hudson Institute report, the 
agency has transformed itself to meet the changing social needs of San Jose. As the city grew 
from a small industrial town in the 1950s to a world technology capital, it drew thousands of 
poor Anglo, Vietnamese, and Latino families, out-of-work laborers, gangs, and crack addicts. 
Meanwhile, CityTeam evolved from a homeless shelter for white, middle-aged alcoholic men 
into a comprehensive program for homeless and drug-addicted women, children at risk, and 
entire families living in or on the edge of poverty. And it has done so by mobilizing an army of 
volunteers and donors, energizing a committed and innovative staff, and applying an intensive, 
holistic approach to solving problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Each of CityTeam's programs combines a 
philosophy of compassionate intervention mixed with strict accountability, an emphasis on long-
term changes in destructive behavioral patterns, and a strong religious underpinning. The Bible is 
the main guide both to morality and to practical living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While some state agencies were devoting a lot of 
time and money to providing the homeless with food and housing, CityTeam began to focus on 
drug and alcohol addiction -- which it considers the root causes of most homelessness -- and in 
1983 established a residential recovery program. While most state-funded recovery programs last 
about 30 days, CityTeam staff believe more time is needed for permanent changes; participants 
remain in recovery programs for between 18 and 24 months. And while government-supported 
rehabilitation programs demand that staff members have degrees in social work, the rescue 
mission's house manager is himself a former crack addict and a graduate of the group's recovery 
and Christian training programs; he's now completing his master's degree.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Field workers realized that preventing addiction 
meant reaching children before they began using drugs. From this insight emerged a youth 
program that includes Camp May-Mac, a summer camp for at-risk inner-city children. 
Throughout the year, CityTeam keeps about a thousand kids busy with regular recreational 
activities, neighborhood clubs, tutoring, leadership development, and Bible studies. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even here their approach is unconventional: The 
group's youth workers actually move into the troubled neighborhoods of east San Jose in order to 
build stable relationships with children at risk. CityTeam President Pat Robertson says kids know 
where the organization's workers live and know that they can reach those workers anytime, day 
or night. "[We] are not just commuting in and out," he says. "The problems of the community are 
our problems."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Whole families are helped through the agency's 
family-relief center, where counselors distinguish urgent and immediate needs from long-term, 
underlying issues. Volunteers distribute food, clothing, and furniture, provide rent assistance, 
assemble holiday food boxes and kits of school supplies, and teach English as a second-language 
to Spanish and Vietnamese residents. Volunteers also act as unofficial caseworkers, following up 
with client families. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Harry Brown, the vice president for administration, 
says CityTeam's extensive volunteer network enables the agency to provide a level of support 
and personal help that rivals publicly funded programs in the city. CityTeam volunteers -- about 
3,000 in any year -- are involved in everything from baby-sitting to tutoring to prayer. Most 
volunteers are recruited through local churches or ads. While some volunteers work only once a 
year, others offer a regular commitment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CityTeam applies the same targeted grass-roots 
approach to fundraising as it does to delivering social services. Most staff members spend up to 
eight hours a week fundraising, providing the agency with about 40,000 active donors -- an 
impressive base for a local charity -- with average contributions of less than $200. "It's Joe and 
Sally Smith at 50 bucks a month who sustain our organization," says Brown. "It's possible 
because there are a large number of stakeholders who believe in the goal and are willing to 
participate in the process."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to a 1995 study by Independent Sector, 
an umbrella group for nongovernmental organizations, most private charities rely heavily on 
direct government subsidies. But Robertson says that because of CityTeam's strong religious 
emphasis, the ministry consistently refuses to accept any government aid, which imposes rules 
against proselytizing clients and discriminating among job applicants. At CityTeam, all staff 
members must share the agency's evangelical Christian beliefs; most programs require 
mandatory chapel attendance or Bible studies and encourage involvement in local churches. "We 
focus on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ and how that influences life on a practical 
level," says Curt Floski, the director of the Rescue Mission and Recovery Program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Staff members say the religious component, with its 
emphasis on personal transformation, is indispensable. An internal 1992 study seems to 
corroborate that: Of the men who had graduated from CityTeam's addiction-recovery program 
between 1986 and 1992, more than 60 percent were still "working and clean and sober." National 
experts have found that among low-income and low-education groups -- the agency's principal 
client population -- recovery success rates typically remain below 16 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Can the CityTeam approach be duplicated in other 
urban areas? The group launched a branch outside Philadelphia in the mid-1980s, and it has 
earned high marks from community leaders. "They have done more to end human suffering in 
Chester [Pennsylvania] than any other organization I know of," says Jack Holefelder, the 
president of the Delaware County Chamber of Commerce.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In San Jose, CityTeam has established the 
International Center for Urban Training. Through seminars, instructional manuals, and work in 
agency projects, trainees learn about the group's holistic service philosophy. The staff also teach 
techniques for fundraising, volunteer recruitment, strategic planning, public affairs, and 
government relations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Officials say they are committed to developing 
models of ministry that can be broadly replicated to help the poor. "One of the things you find is 
that needs out there are relatively common, and the solutions that apply to them also have 
relatively common applications," Brown says. "You have to have a set of core values [relevant] 
to the issues, and then you have to consistently implement those values." And the vital dynamic, 
Robertson says, is personal involvement and intervention: "Programs are best done at the local 
level when you can look people eyeball to eyeball." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The people who challenged Marcia to change made 
a crucial difference in her life. For the first time, she says, she learned that she possessed both 
abilities and responsibilities -- and that it was time to offer them to her family and community. 
Now she spends her evenings teaching "life skills" seminars to other women living at the House 
of Grace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Marcia learned it was possible to walk away from a 
life of addiction, and she has remained drug free. And most importantly, she says, she acquired a 
spiritual foundation for her life. "It's everything that I needed," she says, "things that I lacked for 
so long, or that I was too medicated to even realize were missing."

<title>Welfare Reform and the Death of Marriage – Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>WELFARE REFORM AND THE DEATH OF MARRIAGE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 22, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress is considering adopting a welfare reform plan 
recently put forward by the nation's governors. Unfortunately, the governors’ plan blithely ignores 
America’s No. 1 social problem: the catastrophic rise of illegitimacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly a third of  American children born last year were 
born out of wedlock. The illegitimate birthrate is now rising one percentage point every year. In the 
black community the out-of-wedlock birthrate is now 69 percent. This figure astounds even Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who first issued his prophetic warnings about the erosion of  
marriage among blacks in the early 1960s. Moynihan’s warning was dismissed at the time, but the 
breakup of the black family and the accompanying social calamities have far outstripped his worst 
nightmares. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Ominously, the illegitimate birthrate among whites is 
now edging toward 25 percent, almost exactly equaling the black rate when Moynihan first raised 
his alarm. The white family is now teetering on the same precipice, heading rapidly toward the 
same lethal decomposition that devastated black communities in the late 1960s and 1970s.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Family collapse is the root cause of other social problems: 
poverty, crime, drug abuse, and school failure. Children born out of wedlock are seven times more 
likely to be poor than are those born to couples who stay married. Girls raised in single-parent 
homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out of wedlock when compared to girls 
from intact non-welfare families. And a boy from a single-parent home in the inner city is twice as 
likely to engage in crime when compared to a similar boy who is poor, but living with a father and 
a mother.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nation’s governors have responded to this grim 
reality by ignoring it. In unveiling their welfare reform plan they have declared that there are three 
“key elements” to real welfare reform:  1.) providing more government-funded day-care;  2.) 
increasing child-support payments from absent fathers; and 3.) imposing time limits and work 
requirements (with lots of loopholes) on welfare recipients. The rise in illegitimacy and collapse of 
marriage do not merit even a token comment, let alone aggressive policies, from the governors. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Thus, over the last year, the welfare debate has 
undergone a radical metamorphosis from a focus on combating illegitimacy to a focus on providing 
public support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Eschewing the issue of 
illegitimacy entirely, the governors’ plan instead appears as preparation for a future in which 
marriage plays a sharply diminished role, and the government is heavily involved in meeting the 
needs of an burgeoning population of single-parent families.  The triumph of the left on this aspect 
of the debate has been complete: Fighting illegitimacy is “out” and funding government day-care is 
“in.”
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some would argue that federal action on illegitimacy is 
unneeded: If left alone, the governors will, on their own, tackle the problem. But the governors’ 
silence speaks volumes. Few, if any, governors have made reducing illegitimacy a central theme of 
reform; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. But by refusing to acknowledge or mention 
the collapse of marriage and the rise of illegitimacy in their plan, the governors are implicitly 
condoning and (through paralysis) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. They 
are clearly embarked on a path that will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born 
out of wedlock and raised in government day-care centers. This is not reform. It is a national 
disaster.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The governors’ plan, borrowing heavily from the 
“reform” schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals, dovetails with the interests of 
America’s huge welfare bureaucracy -- an industry that thrives on social decay. While the plan will 
trim the growth rate of welfare spending slightly in the near term, by failing to deal with ballooning 
rates of illegitimacy it sets the stage for an explosive rise in welfare and social-service spending in 
the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nor are the governors alone. Under its recently passed 
legislation, Congress is committed to spending nearly a half trillion dollars over seven years to 
subsidize and support illegitimacy and single parenthood through multiple welfare benefits, day-
care, job training and other services. Under the congressional plan, government will spend $1,000 
to subsidize single parenthood and illegitimacy for each dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The governors’ welfare reform plan would distort 
priorities even further. When the dust settles on welfare reform, even token efforts to fight 
illegitimacy will have fallen by the wayside.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is a tragedy. Marriage in America is dying. The 
governors have prepared not a rescue plan but a coffin. Many in Congress now seem resigned to 
assuming roles as undertakers. The simple fact is that “welfare reform” is nonsense as long as the 
illegitimate birth rate continues to rise. The silence of the governors on the issue is deafening. The 
welfare debate has become like a tea party on the Titanic in which the participants politely refrain 
from mentioning that the deck is tilting 40 degrees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Vision and leadership are sorely needed -- and are sorely 
lacking.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The destruction by Cuban MIGs of two U.S.-registered civilian
aircraft flying over international waters in the Florida Straits
on February 24, 1996, proves once again that Fidel Castro will
never allow real economic and democratic reforms in Cuba. The
Castro regime is lying when it claims that the downed aircraft
were inside the 12-mile territorial limit recognized by international
law. The first aircraft shot down was approximately five miles
north of Cuban airspace, and the second was at least 16 nautical
miles north of Cuban airspace. Four American citizens were killed.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As usual, the Clinton Administration’s rhetoric was sharp, but its initial actions were timid.  In fact, the President did not get tough with Castro until it became clear that there was strong bipartisan support in Congress for immediate tightening of the economic sanctions against Castro.  As a result, on February 28, 1996, the Administration and Congress finally reached agreement on a new version of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (H.R. 927, the "Libertad" bill) that is much tougher than the House and Senate versions passed last fall.  The new provisions include:
<p><ul>
<li> A section that gives the weight of law to all executive orders and regulations regarding Cuba, thereby ensuring that the economic embargo against Cuba cannot be lifted by presidential order unless there is a democratic transition in Cuba without Castro.
<p>
<li> The mandatory denial of U.S. visas to anyone -- corporate officers, principals, or shareholders -- who acquires or uses American-owned property confiscated in Cuba by the Castro regime.
<p>
<li> The inclusion of Title III, allowing U.S. citizens to use American courts to sue foreign companies and individuals who buy confiscated property in Cuba.  This was not in the bill approved by the Senate last fall.  However, to win Clinton’s support, congressional negotiators agreed to language that gives the President the authority to waive the implementation of Title III for six-month periods.  Since the waiver can be renewed, this means that Title III could be delayed indefinitely.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Administration and Congress hailed the compromise package as the toughest bill ever passed to bring about the demise of Castro.  However, while passage of the "Libertad" bill is a major step forward, Castro'’s regime is not likely to be very impressed.  In addition to tightening economic sanctions against Cuba, the U.S. government should make it clear to Castro that any further violations of international law or unprovoked military attacks against American citizens will be countered with appropriate and decisive force. Specifically, the U.S. government should:


























<P><ul>
<li><b> Announce that the U.S. will enforce international laws in the region.</b> This means that Cuba's so-called Air Defense Zone ends
at the 12-mile limit established by international law, not the
24th parallel as claimed by the Castro regime. The U.S. should
make clear to Cuba that any more attacks against civilian aircraft
or boats outside Cuba's 12-mile territorial limit will prompt
an immediate and proportional response by America's armed forces.
To make sure Castro gets the point, U.S. warplanes should patrol
the Florida Straits below the 24th parallel and should respond
to any provocation by Cuban air, sea, or ground-based forces both
immediately and forcefully. A similar policy was pursued with
regard to Libya. In February 1986, U.S. Navy aviators shot down
two Libyan MIGs threatening them in international airspace over
the Gulf of Sidra.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Inform Castro that a new refugee crisis will be considered a
hostile act against the national security of the United States.</b>
The Castro regime has agreed to abide by the immigration act signed
in 1995 between the U.S. and Cuba. This agreement stipulates that
up to 20,000 Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute;s will be issued visas
annually, that the Castro government will not permit any new mass
departures by sea of illegal Cuban immigrants, and that any Cubans
intercepted at sea by U.S. naval forces will be repatriated to
a Cuban port. The U.S. should insist that all aspects of this
agreement be respected by all parties. <BR>

<P>
<li><b>Ban all cash remittances to Cuba from the U.S.</b> This undoubtedly
would affect many Cubans who depend on regular remittances from
their relatives in the U.S., but it also would deprive the Castro
regime of a source of hard currency that now totals over $500
million a year.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Prohibit all visits to Cuba by American citizens.</b> This prohibition
should include journalists, academics, and business people and
should be extended to include visits by way of third countries.
Similarly, Cuban journalists, academics, and other professionals
should not be granted visas to visit the U.S. until the Castro
regime allows independent Cuban professionals and opposition leaders
the same travel privileges it allows its communist apparatchiks.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Declare that U.S. countermeasures are aimed at Castro, not the
Cuban people.</b> Radio and television broadcasts to Cuba on Radio
Mart&iacute; and TV Mart&iacute; should be expanded to inform
the Cuban people that U.S. economic sanctions are directed not
at the Cuban people, but at Fidel and Raul Castro. To undermine
the Castro regime's efforts to rally the support of the Cuban
people with anti-American communist propaganda, the U.S. should
launch a vigorous, sustained effort to inform them that when Castro
leaves power, the U.S. will lift the trade embargo, quickly restore
Cuba's most favored nation status, and remain committed to supporting
the economic and democratic reconstruction of Cuba. To make sure
the broadcasts are beamed into Cuba, U.S. aircraft with broadcasting
equipment should be stationed permanently in the international
skies over the Florida Straits to break the Cuban government's
jamming efforts. Any aggressive acts against these aircraft by
Cuban forces should be countered immediately by American Navy
and Air Force units patrolling the area.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Impose tight controls over the activities and movements of Cuban
officials in the U.S.</b> Efforts by the Castro regime to spread its
lies and propaganda in the U.S. should be banned. If the regime
does not allow democratic and human rights groups to meet freely
and openly in Cuba, and does not allow Americans to participate
in such meetings, the U.S. should not allow Cuban officials to
participate in any similar events within the United States. Moreover,
any Cuban official who violates this restriction should be expelled
from the U.S.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Declare that the U.S. opposes activation of the nuclear reactor
in Cuba.</b> The U.S. should make clear to Castro that America will
not allow Cuba to build and operate a nuclear reactor on the island,
even if the reactor is to be used only for electrical power generation.
Since 1991, construction of a nuclear reactor near Cienfuegos,
about 130 miles east of Havana on Cuba's southern coast, has been
stopped by a lack of funding to complete the project. Three-quarters
of the construction needed to finish the project has been completed.
The plant is not the same design as the Chernobyl reactor; it
more closely matches safer ones built in East Germany during the
Cold War. However, these plants were shut down by West German
officials after unification because of their poor safety record,
and the unfinished reactor in Cuba has been built with faulty
rods and shoddy materials. If completed, Cuba's reactor could
pose a broad safety risk to U.S. lives and property in Florida
and the U.S. Southeast Coast.

True social security
</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%></center>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<br><dd>
Want to save the Social Security system? Start privatizing it. If that sounds like the advice of some crazed conservative with a political death wish, then think again. In February, the New York Times reported that a Clinton administration advisory panel is on the verge of recommending that a portion of workers' payroll taxes be invested in the stock market. Some members of the panel would even allow workers to make their own investment decisions.
<br><dd>
"Our proposal," said Sylvester Schieber, an employee benefits specialist and member of the Advisory Council on Social Security, "would give people the widest choice of investment options. People could invest their Social Security money as they invest the money in their individual retirement accounts. Beyond the floor of protection provided by Social Security, we should let people participate fully in this economic miracle that we call America. It's paternalistic to assume that people cannot take action in their own self-interest."

<br><dd>
Washington, of course, is filled with well-intentioned paternalistic types who presume to know more about what's good for people than the people themselves. That includes saving for retirement. In all likelihood, someone with a similar mindset on the council leaked the news of its draft findings in order to rally opposition to it. That's just the way Washington works. The 13-member panel, which was appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala in June 1994, is scheduled to issue its findings in the spring.

<br><dd>
According to the Times, there are at least two key recommendations in the current draft. First, eight of the 13 members favor shifting some portion of Social Security investments from long-term, interest-bearing government securities into common stocks. Edward Gramlich, professor of economics and dean of the University of Michigan's School of Public Policy, rightly notes that stocks have significantly outperformed bonds over the long term. Panel member Robert Ball, a Democrat and former Social Security commissioner, would invest up to 40 percent of program revenues in the market based on recommendations by a board of government money managers.

<br><dd>
Second, some panel members actually favor creating an individual account for each person covered by Social Security. Although Social Security would still hold the accounts, beneficiaries would choose from, say, 10 options on how the account would be invested.

<br><dd>
These aren't the only issues at stake here. The level of Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes, the eligibility age of Social Security recipients, changes in benefits and the timing of any reforms in the program would all have to be taken into account should the federal government decide to implement them. In that regard, reformers should keep a couple of things in mind. First, the sooner the reforms, the easier it would be to accommodate them. Waiting until Social Security is on the verge of going broke, as it will if the program continues at present, would require drastic changes in eligibility, taxation and benefit requirements.

<br><dd>
Second, the Social Security program today is nothing more than a transfer of tax funds from one generation to the next. Unlike other investment instruments such as stocks, therefore, investing in Social Security is nothing more than a bet on the willingness of future workers to pay payroll taxes. Given its choice, the Clinton administration's advisory council would rather bet on the stock market.

February 22, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></CENTER>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> The budget debate between President
Clinton and Congress is about a lot more than the current level
of federal spending and whether or not taxes should be raised.
It's about who should be responsible for addressing America's
social problems. For example, who should take care of America's
drug problems?</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> President Clinton wants Washington
-- Congress, federal bureaucrats, federal judges -- in charge.
The congressional leadership argues that big government has failed
to address America's human needs. They want to return responsibility
to where it has historically rested -- with families, neighborhoods,
communities, churches and synagogues, and state and local governments.
</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> The president's position was illustrated
when he threw down the gauntlet in his State of the Union address:
&quot;I challenge Congress not to cut out support for drug-free
schools.&quot; Clinton was referring to June 1995, when he vetoed
legislation to limit the Department of Education's &quot;Drug-Free
Schools and Communities&quot; program. With teenage drug use rising
rapidly since 1992, the president has calculated that Congress
can't successfully oppose anti-drug programs for America's youth.
But this completely ignores the question of who is responsible
for taking action.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  Because the congressional leadership believes
the federal government should let communities tackle their own
problems, it voted last year to cut the $465-million budget for
Clinton's anti-drug program by 60 percent. With cameras rolling,
Clinton vetoed the bill in the Rose Garden and called Republicans
&quot;extremists&quot; opposed to drug education. In other words,
as far as the president is concerned, Congress' opposition to
federal anti-drug programs equals opposition to doing anything
about the teen drug problem. </FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Of course, no one doubts the importance
of reducing illegal drug use. And the federal government has important
responsibilities, including bringing international drug traffickers
to justice, stopping interstate commerce in illegal substances,
and cracking down on money-laundering schemes. </FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> But teaching children that drug
use is wrong and harmful is primarily the responsibility of parents
and local communities -- youth organizations, religious institutions,
schools and police. Federal funding is neither necessary nor sufficient
for conveying this very personal message to children on a consistent
basis.</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Moreover, the program in question
provides just $7.25 per pupil each year. By the time this money
makes its way through the various state and local bureaucracies,
many schools receive less than $3 per student. The president suggests
that all those parents and teachers who seek to dissuade young
people from using illegal drugs will cease to do so without a
federal subsidy of $3 a child.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Drug-Free Schools program began
in 1987 during the Reagan administration's expansion of the war
on drugs. Our nation's leaders were particularly anxious to contain
the explosion in crack addiction. Later, it became clear that
crack use had peaked in 1985 and then declined rapidly -- proving
that efforts on the part of parents and communities were working
long before any federal program tried to help them.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Yet, the federal
government increased funding for Drug-Free Schools from $200 million
in 1987 to more than $624 million in 1992, paying little attention
to what was happening to the money. Meanwhile, according to former
Michigan drug czar Robert Peterson, &quot;The health-education
lobby misled educators into believing that drugs only pose another
personal health choice. In doing so, federal drug funds underwrote
controversial sex-education expansion and condom giveaways and
enriched health-education consultants.&quot;
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  Before Michigan
Gov. John Engler stopped it, $32 million in anti-drug funds was
diverted to the Michigan Model for Comprehensive School Health.
More than $81,000 was used to purchase giant plastic teeth and
toothbrushes. Kids who brush, said the &quot;experts,&quot; do
not use drugs. Another $1.5 million was spent on models of the
human torso used just one time. In Washington, D.C., a school
used federal anti-drug money to take its basketball team to a
restaurant. And according to congressional testimony, 400 students
at Dallas' Sunset High School received &quot;A&quot;s for a federally
funded course about substance abuse that never met and had no
teacher.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; However well-intentioned, the nationalization of efforts
to solve problems that should be dealt with on the local level
undermines local and national responsibility and accountability.
By claiming that effective anti-drug education can only come through
federal programs, President Clinton has done America's youth a
disservice.</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Parents, teachers and community
leaders should stop leaving to the federal government a responsibility
that really belongs to them. </FONT>

<font size=6>Liberalism's Last Stand</font><br>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>February 23, 1996<BR>
</FONT>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Liberals are making a big deal out of President
Clinton's rebounding poll numbers, seeing in them a repudiation
of Congress' conservatism. Nice try, but the budget battle between
Congress and the White House - the occasion for the president's
popularity spike - is actually liberalism's last stand.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Traditionally three pillars have propped up the
liberal nanny state: the federal tax system, entitlement programs
and special-interest pork. The budget debate, by placing the national
focus squarely on fiscal sanity and common sense, has dealt a
severe blow to all three.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Start with entitlements. Even after the 1994 elections
gave conservatives control of Congress for the first time in a
generation, nobody expected lawmakers to tackle the No. 1 enemy
of fiscal restraint: entitlement spending. Yet one year later,
serious efforts are underway to reform three of the four largest
entitlement programs: Medicare, Medicaid, and cash welfare (known
as Aid to Families with Dependent Children).  </FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Liberals are willing to go to incredible lengths
to defend the status quo -- for example, by lying about Medicare
&quot;cuts&quot; when spending would rise from $4,800 to $7,100
per beneficiary. Entitlements used to be the liberals' ace in
the hole when Americans thought the &quot;rich&quot; were funding
them. But now that we know who's really paying -- our children
- even Americans who believe strongly in the entitlement programs
concede we have to make reforms.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Further frustrating liberals is the fact that the
days of freewheeling pork-barrel spending are coming to an end.
While Congress' 1996 spending bills contain their share of pork,
there's a lot less than in the past. The transportation appropriations
bill, for example, eliminated all &quot;highway demonstration
projects,&quot; which cost taxpayers millions of dollars a year.
As the traditional beneficiaries of the pork-barrel system liberals
are grieving its impending demise.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Finally, there's taxes. It is inconceivable that
anyone but the most hidebound liberal would argue that America
needs a tax hike. On the contrary, the debate today is not over
whether to cut taxes, but by how much. This is true even though
Congress is in the midst of a historic effort to balance the budget.
Liberals hoped the need to eliminate the deficit would compel
Americans to accept high taxes as a necessary evil, at least for
the time being. Not so. Most Americans want both a balanced budget
and tax cuts. If that means cutting spending more, so be it.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Moreover, the budget debate is only the first round
in the larger fight over taxes.  As those of us who served on
the Kemp Commission on tax reform (which recently came out in
support of a flat tax) know full well, the current system has
virtually no defenders. Not only is it too costly, forcing Americans
to send an average of one-fourth of their income to Washington,
but it is unfair, overly complex, anti-investment and punitive.
 How in the world are liberals going to defend such a system?</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Liberals love to point out that the 104th Congress
has accomplished only a small part of its agenda. Yet from a conservative
standpoint this is a huge victory. By simply changing the terms
of the debate, conservatives both in and out of Congress have
seen to it that the country's inexorable march toward bigger government
has been halted in its tracks.  </FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> On the issues that matter -- taxes, entitlements,
and the corrupt and costly pork-barrel system -- the conservative
philosophy has routed liberalism. That's why the budget debate
 which is really a proxy for the larger battle over the size and
scope and government -- is liberalism's last stand.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=6>FDA: The Smoking Police<BR>
</FONT>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Is the government supposed to protect us from everything
that could possibly harm us? Or are there some areas where we
should be responsible for taking care of ourselves?</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Take teenagers and smoking. The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and its Commissioner David Kessler are getting ready to
pounce on America with a litany of new regulations aimed at stopping
teens from smoking. </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> The FDA's proposed restrictions include:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Banning cigarette vending machines and self-service
displays in stores;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Requiring tobacco companies to launch a $150
million-per-year nationwide TV ad campaign to discourage underage
smoking;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Banning the use of tobacco brand names on T-shirts,
hats, keychains and lighters; and</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Banning brand-name sponsorship of sporting events,
such as the Virginia Slims tennis tournament.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Of course, we all agree underage teenagers shouldn't
smoke; that's not the issue. The issue is whether the FDA should
launch yet another extravagant regulatory crusade whose nuisance
value will likely outweigh any benefits. </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Remember: this is the FDA that conducted the 1991
raid that captured 24,000 half-gallons of Citrus Hill &quot;fresh
choice&quot; orange juice, all because the agency didn't like
the way the o.j. was labeled! Are the food and drug police now
going to swoop down on every mom and pop grocery store to make
sure teen employees aren't smoking in the boy's room? </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Apparently so. Since 1990, the FDA's staff has grown
from 7,600 to 8,700, and its budget has ballooned from $598 million
to $760 million. They've got to do something with all that extra
manpower and money.</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> So, now they're going to send out an army of regulators
whose job will be to make sure mom and pop conceal cigarettes
from view - as if this ever stopped a teenager from doing something
he or she was determined to do. Store workers will have to take
time out to deal with every tobacco transaction, since cigarettes
will only be sold from behind the counter and not from self-service
displays. The watchdogs will probably even send in teenagers paid
to test the system. If something slips through the cracks, out
come the handcuffs!</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Come on. American University student and former
Heritage Foundation intern Jennifer Murray may have said it best
in a recent essay when she accused President Clinton of forgetting
what it's like to be a teenager. &quot;Formula-One racing cars
painted with tobacco company logos, billboards at sports events,
advertisements in magazines (particulary of those men on horseback)
- none of these had anything to do with my [former] tendency to
light up,&quot; Jennifer confessed. &quot;The main contributor
was something President Clinton's 'solutions' would only encourage:
rebellion.&quot; The new federal regulations, far from preventing
teens from smoking, &quot;by focusing additional attention on
the forbidden, could actually entice them,&quot; Jennifer warns.
 </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Isn't there someone more qualified than the FDA
orange juice police to address this issue? Such as parents?</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Let's get real. As Jennifer pointed out, &quot;Banning
cigarette ads and vending machines will do more for President
Clinton's wavering image than it will for teens.&quot; Does anyone
really believe the president is lying awake at night worrying
about teen smoking? I kinda doubt it. But he is worried about
being popular in an election year. </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Smoking sure isn't as popular as it used to be.
And everybody cares about kids.</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> You do the math.<BR>

<h2>Revolution</h2>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a>
<P>
<P>
&#147;Revolution&#148; is one of those words.
<P>
Arguably, it is an American sacred word, like Freedom and Democracy,
Progress and Liberty.  But how we trivialize, and in turn, are
terrified by it!
<P>
It is a word perfect in its diminutive:  The HealthRider is a
&#147;revolutionary&#148; product;  Connecticut&#146;s state government
calls recycling &#147;the next American Revolution;&#148;  each
new electoral shift is hailed as a &#147;revolution.&#148;  We
like revolution as Progress Plus, as long as it stays in the comfort
zone of the familiar, and what we know as the good.  It is Big
Change we control.
<P>
Which is clearly what revolution is not.
<P>
We know this too, so we love the word, but we are afraid of it
too.  We love the revolution we made.  But after 1776 came 1789.
 Big Change was Shanghaied.  High-octane <I>Pilgrim&#146;s Progress</I>
was ditched for the <I>Beau Savage</I>, who led a descent into
the primitive, to The Terror.  Our sober, civic revolution was
stolen by firebrand French wordsmiths.
<P>
And the word itself was abducted too.  Passed from Robspierre
to Rosa, from Lenin to Stalin to the Khmer Rouge, the word has
stayed blood-red, like the roses, cockades, and little red books
that are its symbols.
<P>
We Americans have never recaptured revolution.  We lay claim only
to a patch of thin turf by the great shore, that strip of change
at the edge of Progress.  We are wary now, even afraid, of change
beyond Progress.  We no longer know what to do with revolution.
<P>
But we cannot escape it.  Big change is here:  brought not by
barbarians at the gate, but by ourselves.  We are the barbarians
of big change.  We are the red-capped <I>sans culottes</I>.
<P>
America is again making revolution, and spreading it across the
world.  This revolution should not be confused with political
plots or electoral sallies against an Old Order.  This revolution
is much bigger than that;  like the industrial revolution, it
promises a transformation of America life.  But as tidally overwhelming
as it feels, it is no less of our own making.  And clearly, there
are those who are making it happen, just as there are those who
would sacrifice everything to hold its onset back just one more
day.  Like any revolution.
<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation&#146;s monthly lunches offer
us a chance to talk about Big Change as revolution.  They were
inspired by the fermentive talk that came before the first Bastille
Day&#150;those notorious <I>salons</I>&#150;but they are not meant
to imitate the outcome.  The logo roses on our <I>Notes From Salon
&#145;89</I> are meant to remind us of two things.  First that,
though it was stolen way back when, the word is now up for recapture.
 And second, the shock of other times tells us that revolution
is not about freeze frame shots from <I>Dr. Zhivago</I> or <I>A
Tale of Two Cities</I>.  Revolution is not some far away, long
ago story, so removed from us as to be nothing more than material
for a Hollywood meringue.
<P>
Revolution waits in the wings of every age.  It comes rarely,
but it comes for a reason.  Revolution is the moment when change
long pent up at last tears the fabric of life;  when all the elements
that allow us daily to accommodate to change, for a moment, fail.
 Revolution is the brief, free space between two worlds, and our
time in that space allows us to make the journey from old to new.
<P>
And who knows?  Perhaps Progress will prevail somehow, and the
Big Change will be managed and massaged so that, when it is over,
we never knew what happened.  It is possible.
<P>
Every fiber of mind teases and coaxes us down that road.  But
we don&#146;t need to worry about continuity:  we must confront
the equally possible prospect of its <I>absence</I>.
<P>
And to see possibility, we need to recapture the word:  Revolution.
 Part of that comes when we talk about it &#133; which is what
we intend to keep doing at our lunches.
<P>
We hope you will let us know if you are interested in joining
us.

<title>Agriculture Reform; Can House Succeed Where Senate Failed? -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<center>

<h3>AGRICULTURE REFORM: CAN HOUSE SUCCEED WHERE SENATE FAILED?</h3>

John E. Frydenlund<br> 
Director, Agricultural Policy Project<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Issue Bulletin No. 221<br>
February 28, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The House of Representatives this week will consider 
H.R. 2854, the Agriculture Market Transition Act, to reform the nation's farm programs. This bill is 
companion legislation to the Senate-passed farm bill, S. 1541, the Agricultural Reform and 
Improvement Act of 1996, which falls far short of significant reform. S. 1541 also includes many 
costly nutrition, rural development, and environmental provisions that were added to get it passed 
in the Senate. Lawmakers in the House now have the opportunity to rectify the deficiencies of the 
Senate bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Both S. 1541 and H.R. 2854 replace traditional subsidies 
for the four major crops -- wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice -- with a system of fixed, declining 
payments through the year 2002. They also would eliminate acreage reduction programs. These 
reforms would give producers the needed flexibility to make planting decisions based on the 
demands of consumers rather than on supply controls from Washington, which have idled millions 
of acres of productive U.S. farmland and undermined U.S. agricultural competitiveness in world 
markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; However, both bills also retain the marketing loan 
provisions for the four major crops, in addition to soybeans. Marketing loans allow producers to 
repay to the government only what they receive for their crops, even if it is less than the amount of 
the loan, and pocket the difference. Retaining these marketing loans means that cotton and rice 
producers, in particular, would be able to circumvent the payment limitation. Leaving this 
mechanism in place runs the risk that future loan rates might exceed the market-clearing level, 
causing the United States either to lose export markets or to force the taxpayer to finance wasteful 
government-stimulated overproduction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Furthermore, neither the Senate-passed bill nor the bill 
pending in the House reforms the $1.5 billion-a-year Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); 
instead, both merely cap it at the current 36.4 million acres. Only about 7 million of the acres in the 
CRP are highly erodible, while the majority -- or close to 20 million acres -- constitute some of the 
most productive land in the United States. The remaining acres are quite capable of sustainable 
production if used in conjunction with appropriate conservation practices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Senate bill also retains permanent law. This means 
that, if no further legislative action is taken before 2002, farm programs would revert to the 1938 
and 1949 Acts, leading to the return of traditional subsidy and supply control policies. As reported 
out of the House Agriculture Committee, H.R. 2854 repeals permanent law. If the Senate provision 
prevails over the House version, supporters of a centrally planned agriculture in the future could 
point to any slight downturn in commodity prices or land values as justification for returning to 
government controls. The only way to prevent a return to these failed policies is to repeal 
permanent law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Unfortunately, both S. 1541 and H.R. 2854 reauthorize 
the sugar and peanut programs for seven years, with only inconsequential reforms. Although both 
bills do terminate marketing allotments for sugar and implement a one cent-per-pound penalty on 
forfeited sugar, they also freeze the support price at a level roughly twice the world market price 
rather than legislate any real reduction or phase-down. In the case of peanuts, for instance, both 
bills reduce the quota support rate from $678 a ton to $610 a ton, still well above the world price, 
and fail to reform the restrictive quota program. Moreover, while the Senate bill also fails to reform 
the dairy program, the dairy provisions included in H.R. 2854 actually would expand the extent of 
government regulation and intervention in the U.S. dairy industry.<sup>1</sup>
<p>

<b>Costly Add-ons to the Senate Bill</b> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Several costly items are attached to the Senate bill. S. 
1541 authorizes an additional $1.4 billion for a new Environmental Quality Incentive Program, 
supposedly intended to make it easier for farmers and ranchers to apply for assistance with 
conservation projects. The Senate bill also reauthorizes the food stamp program for seven years 
without any reform. Although traditionally considered in conjunction with the commodity 
programs, the food stamp program was added to the bill on the Senate floor to gain additional votes 
and without any consideration of how this might affect overall reform of the welfare delivery 
system. Finally, S. 1541 creates a new Fund for Rural America, authorizing $300 million for the 
next three years to be used for housing and infrastructure grants and loans. None of these provisions 
is included in the House bill. As there is no need to move these provisions at this time to meet the 
deadline of the 1996 crop season, they should be dealt with in a separate piece of legislation. 

<p>
<b>The House's Opportunity</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The House is expected to consider H.R. 2854, the 
Agriculture Market Transition Act, as early as February 28. If the House Rules Committee 
approves a rule allowing for amendments, there would be an opportunity to provide greater reform 
in the House bill than was achieved in the Senate. If there is such a rule, the House can achieve real 
reform of agricultural policy by taking the following actions:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Conservation Reserve Program.</b> The House should include a provision that would 
give producers the flexibility to remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program. 
Farmers holding CRP contracts on such land should be given the option to withdraw from the 
program. The millions of sustainable acres in the program should be eligible for planting now, 
when demand for U.S. grain and oilseeds is at record levels. The government should not stand in 
the way of this opportunity to produce for strong prices and growing markets.
<p>
<li><b>Sugar and Peanut Programs.</b> Real reform of these programs can be accomplished by 
providing market-driven transitional phase-downs of support prices and elimination of restrictive 
quotas and allotments. Without such reform, the existing sugar cartel -- a handful of wealthy 
processors -- will continue to determine who has the right to produce sugar in this country, and the 
peanut quota system will continue to restrict production to a limited few, based on inheritance.
<p>
<li><b>Dairy Program.</b> The House should scrap the provisions in H.R. 2854 which expand 
government regulation and intervention in the U.S. dairy industry and replace that section of the bill 
with a program that phases out the subsidy system and eliminates the archaic Milk Marketing Order 
system. To phase out the subsidies without getting rid of the marketing orders means that the 
government continues to manipulate the dairy markets and to determine winners and losers, putting 
dairy farmers in certain regions of the country at an unfair disadvantage.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Marketing Loan Program.</b> The House should eliminate the marketing loans for 
wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, and oilseeds, thus eliminating the huge payments that circumvent 
the payment limitations and go primarily to the wealthiest farmers. 
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; With minor exceptions, the Senate has failed to reform 
agricultural policy in its version of the farm bill. However, the House has an opportunity to make 
significant changes in the bill reported out of the House Agriculture Committee. Lawmakers should 
seize that opportunity to craft a farm bill that lets farmers and consumers in the market, rather than 
bureaucrats in Washington, determine what should be grown and produced in America and where 
that production should take place.

<center><h2>The Diceman Cometh: Will Gambling be a Bad Bet for Your 
Town?</h2>
<b>by Ronald A. Reno</b>
<p>
   <b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
 March-April 1996, Number 76</i>
       <hr width=50%></center><p>



&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Flush with a handful of money he had just won at a bowling 
tournament, Joe Koslowski invited some friends to celebrate with him at the nearby Atlantic City casinos. 
Joe, then 16, and all his buddies were allowed in despite the age limit of 21. Once inside, Joe's good 
fortune continued; he parlayed his bowling winnings into a couple of thousand dollars.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After his initial success, Joe returned to the casinos frequently. 
His winning streak eventually ended, but his taste for the thrill of gambling did not. Once out of cash, he 
opened credit accounts under family members' names, using cash advances from the credit cards to 
gamble.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The whole scheme finally came crashing in on Joe last year, 
after he had amassed $20,000 in debt. Now at age 20, Joe, who had no prior criminal record, is serving 
time in a Pennsylvania federal prison for credit-card fraud. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Joe is one of tens of thousands of young people who fall 
victim to America's gambling obsession every year. At least three-quarters of the nation's teens engage in 
some form of gambling. Much of it, of course, is fairly innocuous and occurs among peers: weekend poker 
games, betting on football, the annual NCAA basketball tournament pool. Adolescents have become 
increasingly adept, however, at gaining access to state-sanctioned gambling -- lotteries, casinos, electronic 
poker -- which often becomes a bridge to compulsive or addictive behavior. In 1995, University of 
Minnesota researchers reported that more than half of underage Minnesota teens surveyed had participated 
in some form of legalized gambling. An earlier survey of Atlantic City high-school students revealed that 
nearly two-thirds had gambled at the city's casinos. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is becoming painfully apparent that the only jackpot 
awaiting many of these young people is a life out of control: More than a million adolescents are already 
addicted to gambling, according to Durand Jacobs, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Loma Linda 
University Medical School and an expert on youth gambling. Further, Jacobs says, the gambling addiction 
rate among teens is three times that among adults.  In a recent review of major youth-gambling studies in 
North America, Howard Shaffer, director of the Center for Addiction Studies at Harvard Medical School, 
concluded that roughly one in six teens experiences gambling-related problems, while about 6 percent are 
actually addicted, or pathological, gamblers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The New Jersey Council on Compulsive Gambling, which 
operates a national toll-free hotline (1-800-GAMBLER), reports that callers under 21 phoned the hotline 
4,300 times in 1994, accounting for 11 percent of total calls. Ed Looney, the council's executive director, 
says many of these young people find themselves in desperate straits. He tells of a call regarding a 16-year-
old who had slit his wrists after losing $6,000 -- four years of newspaper delivery earnings -- on the lottery 
in a single day. He tells of the college student from the Midwest who dropped out of school because he lost 
his tuition money gambling; of the 19-year-old New Jersey youth who sold his car for a fraction of its 
value so he could get back into the casinos; of the numerous calls from kids too scared to go back to school 
because they can't pay back their bookies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 The phenomenon of youth gambling is not entirely new, but 
its rapid growth and startling magnitude is alarming. Says Valerie Lorenz, head of Baltimore's Center for 
Compulsive Gambling, "We never saw a teenage gambler 10 years ago. Now we see them regularly." 
Moreover, the most addictive forms of gambling -- eagerly promoted by more and more state governments 
in search of tax revenue -- can produce ripple effects in young lives that undermine families, communities, 
and civic order. As we move into the next century, Shaffer says, "We're going to have major issues with 
youth gambling that will equal or eclipse the problems that we have with substance abuse." 
<P>
<b>A Slippery Slope?</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Experts draw a distinction between the "problem" gambler 
and the "pathological" gambler. According to Shaffer, pathological gamblers exhibit three basic 
characteristics: an inability to stop gambling despite massive losses, a sense of lost control, and a 
compulsion or craving to gamble. Problem gamblers can be affected in less severe ways, including 
difficulty concentrating, failure to fulfill family, school, or work obligations, general irritability, and 
sleeplessness. The two, however, are closely connected. Shaffer refers to problem gamblers as being "in 
transition," either moving toward or away from pathological gambling behaviors. Individuals may 
frequently move in and out of these designations. It is estimated that 1 to 3 percent of the adult population 
are pathological gamblers, but nearly twice that number are problem gamblers.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Probably 90 percent of the population can gamble 
"recreationally," but a significant minority cannot. Moreover, all forms of gambling can be addictive for 
teens, as well as adults, though they vary in their potency. The most addictive, such as electronic poker, 
contain the element of rapid "action" and occur in relative isolation, Shaffer says. Video gambling and slot 
machines are inherently more dangerous than bingo or the lottery. But the lottery frequently serves as a 
gateway to other gambling activities for teens. Once exposed to even a relatively benign form of gambling 
such as the lottery, many find themselves craving greater excitement. Studies bear this out: Participation in 
other forms of gambling is higher in those states that have lotteries.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many problem and pathological gamblers -- adolescents or adults 
-- become debtors. Once they get in over their heads, teen gamblers follow the cue of their elders: They 
turn to crime. Jacobs contends that at least one in 10 juveniles has used illegal means such as stealing, 
shoplifting, selling drugs, or prostitution to obtain money to pay off gambling-related debts. A 1994 study 
of Massachusetts youth found that 5 percent had been arrested for gambling-related problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite the extent and impact of youth gambling, Jacobs says, 
the level of public awareness is "absolutely abysmal." A few recent high-profile press reports, along with a 
meeting last spring of the North American Think Tank on Youth Gambling Issues at Harvard, have begun 
to bring the issue to the public's attention. Teens themselves remain largely unaware of the dangers 
associated with gambling. Shaffer found that only one-quarter of Massachusetts youth surveyed rated 
gambling as potentially dangerous, compared with 60 percent or more who perceived the dangers in 
alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Gambling in all its forms is proving to be nearly irresistible to 
a rising generation that frequently tells pollsters of its apprehensions about a bleak economic outlook. 
Traditional forms of gambling such as church bingo have generally  been able to restrain compulsive 
betting. Government promotion of gambling, including the $350 million states spend advertising the 
lottery, has been more pernicious. It communicates to young people the subtly destructive notion that the 
work ethic is passé, that all they need is "a dollar and a dream," as one lottery advertisement puts it. 
Perhaps that's why an average of 200,000 minors have been turned away from Atlantic City casinos every 
year for the past decade, according to figures from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Another 
24,000 underage gamblers are escorted from the casino floor annually. Many more gamble in the casinos 
undetected. Ironically, many state lotteries are pitched to the electorate as a honey pot for public education. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"By sending young people the message that they need to 
gamble to get ahead," Shaffer says, "we're telling them not to study calculus, not to study science, and we 
shouldn't be surprised that America is now falling behind other cultures in terms of intellectual pursuits."
<p>
<b>A National Compulsion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If young people follow the lead of the adult gambling culture 
around them, they'll squander much more than their intellectual energy. Americans will legally wager 
more money this year than they will spend on groceries -- some $500 billion. That number represents a 
3,000 percent increase since 1976. Utah and Hawaii are the only states that prohibit all forms of gambling, 
though Hawaii is considering casinos. Casinos are now legal in about half the states and constitute nearly 
half of total gambling revenues, which are growing at the rate of 15 percent annually.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"America is on a gambling binge," says Congressman Frank 
Wolf, who is pushing legislation to establish a national commission to study the effects of legalized 
gambling. The growth will undoubtedly continue, at least in the short run, as state and local governments 
scramble for an even bigger slice of the gambling revenue pie. In 1994, governments received $1.4 billion 
from casinos alone. Lotteries contributed another $10 billion to state coffers. That same year, revenue-
hungry state legislatures considered more than 1,600 gambling-related bills.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unfortunately, government's addiction to gambling has been 
transmitted to the public. Nationwide, it is estimated that about 10 million Americans have a gambling 
habit that is out of control. A recent surge in the number of problem and pathological gamblers is strongly 
correlated with the explosion of legalized gambling opportunities. An unlikely source for a case study is 
Iowa. A 1989 survey indicated that 1.7 percent of Iowa residents were problem or pathological gamblers. 
Shortly thereafter the state added riverboat casinos and casinos on Indian lands and also expanded 
parimutuel wagering. A subsequent survey last year showed the percentage of Iowans with a serious 
gambling problem had ballooned to 5.4 percent. An additional 78,000 Iowa adults had become hooked on 
gambling in that six-year period.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Iowa study is consistent with other findings. John Kindt, a 
professor of commerce and legal policy at the University of Illinois, says that when gambling activities are 
legalized and made accessible to new jurisdictions, increases in the numbers of addicted gamblers range 
between 100 and 550 percent. These newly created addicts are turning in overwhelming numbers for help -
- help that the mental-health community is ill-equipped to supply. According to the National Council on 
Problem Gambling, there are fewer than a hundred treatment programs nationwide for pathological 
gamblers, as compared with some 13,000 such programs for alcoholism and other substance-abuse 
problems. Tens of thousands are seeking help through local Gamblers Anonymous groups; GA has added 
four hundred new chapters in the United States in the last five years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee last 
September, American Gaming Association (AGA) president Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. claimed that the 
gambling industry is making substantial efforts to address the problem. So far, however, little has been 
done. "The casino industry is heavily dependent on the revenues of psychologically sick people," says 
Earl Grinols, an economist at the University of Illinois, who calculates that more than half of a casino's 
take comes from problem and pathological gamblers. University of Minnesota researchers found that a 
mere 2 percent of gamblers in that state accounted for nearly two-thirds of all money spent on the state's 
casinos, charitable pulltab games, lottery, and the like.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Experts warn that the number of gambling addicts has yet to 
crest. In fact, Jacobs predicts that it will be the nation's fastest-growing addictive behavior. In addition to 
greater availability of traditional gambling venues, the emergence of hi-tech video gambling machines, 
gambling on the Internet, and interactive telephone and television gambling will undoubtedly contribute to 
the problem. These addictions will come with enormous social and economic price tags, as social scientists 
and researchers -- and millions of families -- have already discovered.
<p>
<b>Gambling with the Family</b> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In August 1993, Mike and Sharon James (not their real 
names) and their two preschool children left a successful business in East Liverpool, Ohio, for promising 
job prospects in Charleston, S.C. The couple had been in Charleston one month when Sharon received an 
overdrawn notice from the bank. Puzzled, she contacted the bank to clear up the "error"; the couple had 
several thousand dollars in their checking account set aside for a down payment on a house.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Sharon discovered that her husband of 10 years had made 
several withdrawals in recent weeks, many in the neighborhood of $1,000. When she questioned Mike, she 
learned that he had spent the money on South Carolina's ubiquitous video poker machines. Despite 
Sharon's pleas and attempts at treatment, Mike couldn't kick the habit. He squandered the family's 
remaining savings, hocked many of their possessions, even cashed in the children's savings bonds, and left 
the family $20,000 in debt. Finally, Sharon filed for divorce. Mike wound up in the county jail for 
delinquency in child-support payments and for writing bad checks.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"This man was a wonderful person, a very caring father," 
says Sharon. "I really believe he didn't realize what he was doing, because he was never like that before. 
This addiction just grabs you and twists you. It destroyed him and us."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similar stories abound in gambling communities across the 
nation. Yet the scope of the problem is tragically underestimated, largely because so little research has been 
undertaken regarding gambling's impact on the family. The meager available data comes primarily from 
surveys of small groups of compulsive gamblers seeking treatment. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Last year the Illinois Council on Compulsive Gambling 
surveyed nearly 200 Gamblers Anonymous members and found that 16 percent were divorced due to their 
gambling addictions; another 10 percent had separated as a result. In an earlier study of spouses of 
compulsive gamblers, Valerie Lorenz discovered that 78 percent had threatened separation or divorce, and 
half had carried through on their threats. Jacobs surveyed 850 high-school students in Southern California 
and found that children of compulsive gamblers were almost twice as likely to experience the trauma of a 
broken home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Harrison County, Mississippi, the hub of the state's casino 
industry, the number of divorces rose from 440 in 1992 to nearly 1,100 in 1993, the first full year after 
casinos. Judge William L. Stewart, who has served on chancery court along Mississippi's Gulf Coast for 17 
years, says he knows gambling to be a factor in about a third of the divorce cases he now oversees. "Other 
than the general decline of morality in society, I don't believe there has been a single factor [affecting 
divorce rates] like this. It's just not a normal thing. This thing is huge. It has a tremendous effect on a 
community." 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Spousal and child abuse and neglect are other problems 
attendant to gambling addictions, as reports from social-service agencies in gambling communities 
consistently attest. The Gulf Coast Women's Center in Biloxi, Mississippi, has averaged 400 additional 
crisis calls per month since the advent of casinos there. Central City, Colorado, reported a six-fold rise in 
child protection cases in the year after casinos arrived. Jeffrey Bloomberg, former state's attorney for the 
Deadwood, South Dakota area, cited a similar increase in his September 1994 congressional testimony, and 
described how children were being left in cars all night while their parents gambled. Earl Grinols points out 
that Nevada led the nation in deaths of children attributable to abuse from 1979 to 1988, a period when 
casino gambling was illegal everywhere else except in Atlantic City. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Children of compulsive gamblers also suffer in other ways. 
Jacobs found that such youth have a greater propensity for substance abuse, lower academic achievement, 
juvenile delinquency, and poorer mental health. They are also far more likely to develop gambling 
addictions themselves. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Compulsive gamblers are at much greater risk for other 
harmful behaviors. According to Henry Lesieur, about half of compulsive gamblers experience problems 
with alcohol and substance abuse. Lesieur also notes that compulsive gamblers are five to 10 times more 
likely to attempt suicide than is the general population. The National Council on Problem Gambling states 
that 20 percent of compulsive gamblers attempt suicide. Many succeed. A 19-year-old Iowa college 
student, a St. Louis-area housewife and church volunteer, and an Illinois businessman are a few of the 
recent self-inflicted casualties that have received press attention, but hundreds of others go relatively 
unnoticed year after year. Nevada has the highest suicide rate in the nation. In Gulfport, Mississippi, 
attempted suicides rose more than 200 percent in the first two years of casinos, while suicide attempts 
soared from six to 66 in nearby Biloxi in the first year alone. Family members of compulsive gamblers are 
also at greatly increased risk for suicide, according to Lesieur.
<p>
<b>Showdown in River City</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Over the last decade the gambling industry has done a 
phenomenal job of selling itself as an economic elixir to communities strapped for revenue. Inflated 
promises of jobs, tourism, and additional tax monies have seduced politicians and citizens in dozens of 
states and communities. The numbers, however, are beginning to catch up with the gambling forces. As 
Americans become more aware of the societal devastation wrought by legalized gambling, the industry is 
finding it increasingly difficult, and ever more expensive, to peddle its wares. In recent elections, gambling 
interests have outspent opponents by margins of 10, 20, even 50 to one, and are still losing far more often 
than not.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Jefferson City, Missouri, which voted for casino riverboats in 
1992, voted them out last November. Fledgling efforts are underway in Louisiana, Wisconsin, and 
elsewhere to repeal legalized gambling. Even the industry's own polls show that gambling's acceptance 
appears to be waning.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The issue, however, is far from decided. Gambling interests 
have targeted several key states again this year -- California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, and Texas, among others - for expansion. In New York, the gambling lobby last year helped 
introduce a form of keno called "Quick Draw." It puts casino-style gambling right in front of teens, 
appearing in bowling alleys, supermarkets, and even candy shops to lure kids into shooting high-tech craps. 
If these and other efforts are successful, it will be a sure bet that millions more Americans -- many of them 
children -- will slip into addiction, and the destitution and darkness that go with it. 
<p>

<p>
<b>Crimeland </b>
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The gambling industry has launched a major offensive to try to 
convince Americans that they don't know what they know: Gambling breeds crime. The industry has hired 
a handful of law-enforcement officials and academics to assert that gambling is no more conducive to 
crime than Disney World. It's a Mickey Mouse argument.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Data from gambling communities points to an overwhelming 
link between legalized gambling and criminal activity. Three years after the arrival of casinos, Atlantic 
City rose from fiftieth to first in the nation among cities in per capita crime. Nevada continually ranks near 
the top in crime per capita.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The experiences of newer gambling communities mirror those 
of Nevada and Atlantic City.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Within five years of permitting limited stakes casinos in 
Deadwood, South Dakota, serious crimes jumped 93 percent. Mississippi's Gulf Coast welcomed casinos 
in August of 1992. After a year, bank robberies had increased from one to 13, and armed robberies tripled. 
In Ledyard, Connecticut, home of the nation's richest casino, rape, robbery, car theft, and larceny all 
increased more than 400 percent in the first three years after Foxwoods opened.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The fact is in every city that casinos have been introduced in 
any significant way, crime in the streets has gone up, and there has been a marked rise," says 
Massachusetts attorney general Scott Harshbarger. Frank J. Kelley, Michigan's attorney general for more 
than 30 years, told the International Conference on Gambling in 1994 that "there has never been an issue 
that has disturbed me any more than the proliferation of gambling in our state."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Last October, Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran 
Jr., issued a notable report on the gambling-crime link. Curran concluded: "[C]asinos would bring a 
substantial increase in crime to our State. There would be more violent crime, more crimes against 
property, more insurance fraud, more white collar crime, more juvenile crime, more drug and alcohol-
related crime, more domestic violence and child abuse, and more organized crime."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The gambling industry insists that the crime link is solely a 
factor of more people visiting these communities. The testimony of the law-enforcement community, 
gambling's demonstrated ties to organized crime, and the millions of gambling addicts who become 
criminals as a result of their addictions attest otherwise. One might say the gambling industry's denial of 
these facts is just plain Goofy.
<p>

<b>Cashiering Casinos</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite shoestring budgets, grass-roots groups in dozens of states 
are doing a surprisingly effective job of stalling the gambling juggernaut:
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mirage Casinos finally cut its losses at more than $10 million 
and left Bridgeport, Connecticut, late last year after failing in its four-year push to construct the nation's 
largest casino. With support from the media and the governor, and a non-stop public-relations barrage, the 
casino deal looked like a sure thing. But the dogged persistence of various anti-gambling groups prevailed.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion (PAGE) has 
employed a two-pronged strategy to thwart riverboat casinos. PAGE gathered about 44,000 petition 
signatures, which it presented to the governor at a widely publicized press conference. PAGE has been 
working behind the scenes with key legislators, from both the Democratic and Republican parties, to keep 
gambling bills from reaching a vote.
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eleven different casino companies hired lobbyists last year in 
hopes of squeezing casinos into Maryland. They had planned to close the deal by this spring. Maryland's 
No Casino group derailed the plan largely via a series of anti-casino rallies held around the state last fall. 
Gambling lobbyists have now forsaken their attempts to get casinos in Maryland.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Last November, voters in Washington state trounced Initiative 
651, which would have allowed unrestricted gambling on Indian lands.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fifty gambling lobbyists descended on Virginia last year to 
push for riverboat casinos. Virginians Deserve Better blunted their efforts by joining with dozens of 
minority pastors in targeted areas of southern Virginia.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Florida's No Casinos is preparing to repel the gambling 
industry's fourth casino initiative, expected this fall. No Casinos has built a broad coalition including 
liberal and conservative religious groups, law-enforcement officials, business and political leaders, and 
tourism interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Rev. Tom Grey, coordinator for the National Coalition 
Against Legalized Gambling, says state-based affiliates prevailed -- via referendum, the legislature, or the 
courts -- in 21 of 23 contests over the last couple of years.

Curdling the cream in the Clinton coffee
</FONT></center>
<br><dd>
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. The front page of The Washington Times on the morning after New Hampshire was a caution correctly read in the White House, where, despite the hired bravado of the president's regiments of lawyers, the fog shrouding Bill Clinton's view of November grows thicker, the knot of fear in Miss Hillary's tummy expands to the size of an artichoke-y.
<br><dd>
<I>Buchanan wins New Hampshire vote/Stuns Dole;/Alexander a strong third</I>. This was the stuff of good cheer all around: dissension in the enemy's camp, a cracking coalition, rage in the ranks, mutiny at the officers' club. You couldn't blame the president and Miss Hillary for the smiles that sweetened their morning coffee.

<br><dd>
But here's the smaller headline that curdled the cream in that coffee: <I>Arkansas bankers indicted for loans/Fraud suspected in Clinton races</I>. The front page of The Washington Post, for once, offered scant solace: <I>Arkansas bankers indicted in scheme/to help fund 1990 Clinton campaign</I>.

<br><dd>
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

<br><dd>
The amnesia epidemic that has swept through the White House -- there's been nothing like it since the AIDS epidemic swept through San Francisco like Epsom salts -- continued Feb. 22 as Harold Ickes, with the rattled mien of a flustered Ichabod Crane, couldn't remember much about anything, beginning with why the White House only last week found another hundred pages of Whitewater documents it had said were lost. "Inadvertent," Mr. Ickes described it.

<br><dd>
One of the panelists noticed the notation, "DK Draft," and asked whether this meant that Donald Kendall, the president's lawyer for bank-robbery affairs, had written it. Mr. Ickes, in the White House refrain now so familiar to all, replied that he didn't remember. Of course.

<br><dd>
Mr. Ickes demonstrated the testiness and combativeness that White House aides cower before, particularly when he employs testiness and combativeness to protect Miss Hillary. Once he dropped his mask of toughness. Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina recalled that his father was known in FDR's Cabinet as "Honest Harold," and asked him, in the down-home vernacular: "If God had granted him to be in this room, would he say, 'Boy, you're doing a good job,' or, 'Son, you're with the wrong crowd, get out,'?"

<br><dd>
With an ever so slight crack in his voice, the son replied: "I think he would have approved of what I was doing, because we've done nothing wrong."

<br><dd>
Another panelist wondered about another passage in the notes which the White House has only now deigned to turn over to the Senate Whitewater committee: An investigation, said one notetaker, "may result in focus on friends and associates of the president, begin to 'squeeze' them, and some may be subject to indictment."

<br><dd>
Mr. Ickes, a labor lawyer in New York before he came down to help Hillary dismantle American medicine, insisted that not only did he not know who wrote the memo, he didn't even know what the term "squeezed" meant. How would a New York labor lawyer have ever heard about putting the "squeeze" on a witness?
<br><dd>
During a break in the testimony, Mr. Ickes' own pleader, the ubiquitous and expensive Uncle Bob Bennett, who is also the president's lawyer for bimbo eruptions, couldn't imagine why anyone would think his client had done anything wrong.
<br><dd>
&quot;I don't know what's wrong with that,&quot; he said of Mr. Ickes' answer. &quot;This is a big piece of cotton candy. You bite into it and there is nothing there.&quot;
<br><dd>
Expensive pleader or not, Mr. Bennett sounds as if he's having difficulty persuading himself. And over at the White House, the president's press agent, Mike McCurry, took pains to underscore the need for presidential aides to make sure they turn over all Whitewater documents. Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, &quot;doesn't want documents dribbling out. He wants everyone to turn everything upside down and produce whatever needs to be produced.&quot;
<br><dd>
Sure he does. But what he really doesn't want is anything to enhance the perception, now deeply ingrained in the Washington consciousness, that what the Clintons are producing is not documents but alibis, excuses, and yarns.
<br><dd>
This week the Senate must decide whether to extend the Whitewater committee's life and writ. Even Chris Dodd, the panelist from Connecticut and the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee (talk about your conflicts of interest) says he's &quot;troubled&quot; by the White House delays but naturally he sees &quot;nothing of substance&quot; to justify an extension. Says he, invoking an odd analogy: &quot;This has gone on longer than the O.J. Simpson trial.&quot; But everyone knows that if Bob Dole can't manage to win this one, he's outta here.
<br><dd>
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

<h3>THE EMERGING INTERNATIONAL MAFIA</h3>

By <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/grassley.html">Sen. Charles Grassley</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even as America wages a fierce battle against organized 
criminal gangs here at home, the threat to U.S. interests from an emerging international crime cartel 
grows more serious every day. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Groups like the Colombian Cartels, the Asian Triads and the 
Italian Mafias -- long destabilizing factors in their host countries -- are becoming significant players 
on the international stage, carrying out their criminal activities across borders and threatening the 
stability and interests of numerous countries.  In short, they have become an international security 
threat.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fresh evidence of this growing threat comes from Colombia, 
where President Ernesto Samper is under pressure to resign for allegedly taking massive campaign 
contributions for his 1994 presidential race from the Cali cocaine cartel. Whether these particular 
charges are true or not, groups like the Cali cartel -- which is already responsible for up to 80 
percent of the cocaine that reaches the United States -- are increasingly able to operate above the 
law, buying off or even killing the government officials who are supposed to work with U.S. law-
enforcement agencies to crack down on crime.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's worse, the cartels, triads and Mafias are now forging 
alliances with criminal organizations in Russia, Mexico and Nigeria, giving these organized crime 
syndicates a truly international reach.  They are becoming an international crime corporation with 
illegal franchises spanning the globe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The ability of these groups to operate with complete 
disregard for local or international law -- not to mention common decency -- now threatens to 
destabilize a number of countries, especially poor states that are trying to implement economic and 
democratic reforms.  By corrupting government officials and undermining legitimate business 
enterprises, these criminal cabals threaten to set back progress in developing nations by many years, 
and in the case of Russia, could forestall reform indefinitely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The list of crimes the new international criminal 
organizations are involved in is long.  They traffic in drugs, people, and chemical, biological and 
nuclear material.  They perpetrate billions of dollars worth of fraud against banks, businesses and 
governments.  They destroy lives, undermine economies, diminish confidence in political and 
economic reform, and spread corruption and violence.  In short, they have become an international 
security threat. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What to do?  Clearly, we need to devise a new foreign policy 
to deal with these criminal groups -- to put them out of business and in jail.  In his recent speech to 
the United Nations, President Clinton acknowledged the growing threat posed by international 
criminal groups and called for stronger efforts to fight these organizations.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such efforts must achieve several goals: dismantle the major 
criminal groups, stiffen the penalties for engaging in international crime, and foster international 
cooperation to counter the actions of criminal elements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At home, U.S. policy-makers can take concrete steps to help 
meet these goals.  We must beef up intelligence capabilities against key groups and their leaders.  
We must work with other countries to strengthen their legal systems and police forces.  We must 
enhance our ability to monitor the flow of money to prevent criminal organizations from abusing 
international financial and banking systems.  And we must increase international awareness of the 
threat these groups pose and forge a united front to bring them to justice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No country is immune from the debilitating influence of 
international organized crime. The political corruption scandals in Colombia and Italy, the 
challenge to democracy in Russia, the brazen ruthlessness of the Mexican Mafia, and U.S. streets 
awash in drugs -- all are the product of ruthless criminal organizations willing to trample human life 
and dignity in their rush for ill-gotten gain. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the most powerful country on earth, the United States has 
an obligation to lead the world in crafting a tough, international response. Just as President Bush 
cobbled together a coalition to counter the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, so too must President 
Clinton start to work with any interested nation in challenging the threat posed by the new 
international crime cartels.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unlike Colombia, the United States has not yet faced a 
political threat from international criminal activity.  But we see the impact of the international 
crime on our streets every day, in the wasted lives and drug violence tearing our cities apart.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Cold War may be over, but America still has enemies in 
the world. Emerging international crime cartels are simply the latest.  The United States cannot 
afford to ignore this problem, but must begin to fashion a foreign-policy response as tough as the 
stand we take against criminal groups here at home.

<a name="mender"><h2>Marriage Menders</h2></a><br>
<b>by Elizabeth Schoenfeld</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A report last year by the Council on Families in 
America characterized America's culture of divorce this way: "Relationships between men and 
women are not getting better; by many measures, they are getting worse. They are becoming 
more difficult, fragile, and unhappy. . . . The promises of the divorce revolution proved empty, 
its consequences devastating for both adults and children." Researchers predict that roughly half 
of existing marriages will break up, and nearly three out of five new unions will end in divorce or 
permanent separation. For many couples, such odds can make their sacred vows seem more like a 
crapshoot.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Along with the problem of illegitimacy, failed and 
failing marriages are at the root of the nation's worst social ills. But what can we do about it? 
Public policymakers need to reconsider the legal regime governing marriage and divorce, from 
reform of no-fault divorce laws to longer waiting periods for divorcing parents. In the next issue 
of <i>Policy Review</i>, we'll examine which states have the lowest divorce rates, where 
legislatures are trying to make divorce more difficult, and other efforts to reverse the 
proliferation of divorces. 
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Public policy, however, is only one part of any 
solution. Over the past 20 years, research has revealed or confirmed the elements of successful 
marriages. Many programs, support groups, and therapy techniques are now available to 
strengthen even the most troubled relationships. The religiously based Marriage Encounter and 
Family Life weekend retreats, for example, have renewed the faith and commitment of thousands 
of couples. In the pages that follow, we profile a few of the ideas for forming more perfect 
unions, in the hope that they take root in families, communities, and religious congregations 
around the country.
<p>
<a name="div">
<b>Divorce Buster</b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the 1960s, as divorce rates began to climb, many 
family counselors began to see divorce itself as a therapeutic option of first resort. Therapist 
Michele Weiner-Davis recalls a fellow counselor who claimed that 90 percent of the marriages in 
his practice were dead on arrival. Weiner-Davis herself used to believe that many marital 
problems were insurmountable.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No longer. "The vast majority of relationship 
problems are solvable and the vast majority of marriages are worth the effort required to make 
them work," she writes. "Now I do whatever I can to help people find solutions to their marital 
problems so that they can stay together."
<p> 
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Why the change? Weiner-Davis says she's seen up 
close the suffering and disillusionment that can come with divorce. And blaming one spouse as 
the source of the problems, she says, is a mistake, because "it doesn't take into account the roles 
both partners play in the deterioration of the relationship." Bad habits and behaviors developed 
over years go with them when they end the marriage.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I don't believe in 'saving marriages,'" she says. "I 
believe in divorcing the old marriage and beginning a new one -- with the same partner." With 
that creed in hand, Weiner-Davis pioneered the use of Solution-Oriented Brief Therapy (SBT) in 
marriage counseling. Unlike traditional therapy methods, which tend to focus on problems and 
on the past, SBT emphasizes solutions. For example, rather than encouraging couples to talk 
about childhood disappointments and how they may be affecting their relationship, SBT asks 
them to define what they want to accomplish in their reconciliation, and then to devise a strategy 
for meeting these goals.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In her own practice, Weiner-Davis has found that 
SBT can salvage at least four out of five seriously troubled marriages. She says that couples can 
begin to turn their relationships around within a month, even if only one spouse wants to save the 
marriage. She promotes SBT in her recent bestseller, <i>Divorce Busting: A Step-By-Step 
Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again</i> (Fireside).

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For information about SBT therapists, send a self-
addressed stamped envelope to Michele Weiner-Davis, P.O. Box 197, Woodstock, Ill. 60098. 
Tel.: 815-337-8000. Also available is a home-study course with six audio cassettes and a 
workbook called Keeping Love Alive.</i>
<p>
<a name="lang">
<b>The Language of Diplomacy </b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One of the most common reasons marriages break 
up is that husbands and wives don't know how to communicate or handle conflicts. The problem 
may be not what you fight about, but how you fight. The good news is that just about anyone -- 
even the most emotionally inept -- can learn skills in communication and conflict resolution. 
There are numerous seminars to prevent divorces and enhance marriages. Here are three that are 
especially well researched and effective. In each of them, participants follow the curriculum in 
small groups and then huddle with instructors for individual coaching.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>PREP.</b> "We have a Geneva Convention for 
the way we conduct warfare," says Howard Markman, the director of the Center for Marital and 
Family Studies and developer of the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP). 
"What we need is a sort of Geneva Convention for handling marital conflict." PREP supplies just 
that by imparting rules that couples can use to negotiate the minefields of marriage, including 
calling "timeouts" when a conflict gets out of hand and taking turns listening to each other. The 
"how-to"s of conflict resolution are taught in a five-session workshop that offers plenty of 
practice and coaching. PREP recently won a four-year grant from the National Institute for 
Mental Health to train clergy in administering the program. The PREP approach can be 
previewed in a book called <i>Fighting for Your Marriage: Positive Steps for Preventing 
Divorce and Preserving a Lasting Love</i>, by Howard Markman, Scott Stanley, and Susan L. 
Blumberg (Jossey-Bass).
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For information about counselors trained in the 
PREP approach, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to PREP, Inc./Referrals, 1780 S. 
Bellaire Street, Suite 621, Denver, Colo. 80222. Tel.: 303-750-8798.</I>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>	Couple Communication.</b> More than 
500,000 couples have been helped by this program, which provides practical skills in four to six 
sessions. The program uses tools such as the "Listening Cycle," which helps spouses ascertain, 
for example, whether they are really listening to each other or just waiting for their turn to talk. 
Developed by Sherod Miller, Phyllis Miller, Daniel Wackman, and Elam Nunnally at the 
University of Minnesota, the curriculum is praised by therapists for being easy to use.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For more information, call 1-800-328-5099, or 
write to Interpersonal Communication Programs, Inc., 7201 S. Broadway, #11, Littleton, Colo. 
80122</I>.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>	Relationship Enhancement Therapy.</b> 
Pioneered by Bernard and Louise Guerney, this approach stands out for long-term effectiveness 
when measured against marriage-enrichment programs, including Marriage Encounter. In part, 
its success can be attributed to the greater length of its program (nine to 10 weeks of two-hour 
sessions), but it also provides a unique emphasis on the teaching of empathy.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	There are a few RE centers around the country, but 
Bernard Guerney, its originator, can be reached in Bethesda, Md., at 301-986-1479.

<a name="better">
<b>Better Wed Than Dead</b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Couples may want to think twice before saying "I 
don't." Recent research indicates that getting a divorce could kill you. For men, "being divorced 
and a nonsmoker is only slightly less dangerous than smoking a pack or more a day and staying 
married," says David B. Larson, the president of the National Institute for Healthcare Research, a 
think tank located in Rockville, Maryland.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Divorced men are twice as likely as married men to 
die prematurely from cardiovascular disease, four times more likely to die from suicide, and 
seven times more likely to die from pneumonia. Divorced women, on the other hand, have lower 
fatality rates than their married counterparts, but are more likely to suffer acute or chronic 
disease. And both sexes face a greater likelihood of accidental death for six months before and 
after divorce.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Separating spouses aren't the only ones to suffer the 
medical effects of a divorce. Children of divorce are 50 percent more likely to develop asthma, 
and 20 to 30 percent more likely to suffer an injury. And the deleterious effects last long beyond 
childhood. One long-term study at the University of California at Riverside found that people 
whose parents divorced before they were 21 faced a one-third greater risk of dying in any given 
year. Men whose parents had divorced had a median life span of 70 years, while those whose 
parents stayed married lived 10 years longer; for women, the figures were 82 versus 86 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you value your health, get regular exercise, eat 
plenty of fruits and vegetables -- and stay married. Of course, tense marriages carry their own 
health risks: A study by researchers at Ohio State University has found that couples who engage 
in fierce fighting suffer impaired immune systems.
<p>
<a name="count">
<b>Counting the Costs </b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Anyone interested in family issues but intimidated 
by the dense prose of academic journals will appreciate a recent book from the National Institute 
for Healthcare Research. Need to know how divorce contributes to health-care costs or the 
relationship between marital disruption and juvenile delinquency? It can all be found in <i>The 
Costly Consequences of Divorce: Assessing the Clinical, Economic, and Public Health Impact of 
Marital Disruption in the United States</i>, by David B. Larson, James P. Swyers, and Susan S. 
Larson. This 282-page manual is a mother lode of up-to-date research on everything from 
changes in attitudes about marriage and divorce to the morbidity consequences of divorce to the 
ingredients for marital satisfaction.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some of the reasons examined for marital instability 
may not surprise: premarital pregnancy, short courtships, exposure to divorce as a child. "Those 
who marry before age 20," the book notes, "are twice as likely to divorce as those who wait until 
their twenties." But contrary to conventional wisdom, there is growing evidence that those who 
live together before marriage will experience poorer quality marriages and higher divorce rates 
than those who do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The book also gathers the latest data on the effect of 
religious commitment on marriage. One study found that marital dissolution among white men is 
three times more common for those who never attend church than those who attend at least twice 
a month. Protestants and Catholics as a group have higher divorce rates than Jews, but within 
each faith, the decisive issue is the degree of religious commitment. Part of the reason, 
researchers suggest, is that "those who actively participate in their church have a wide network of 
friends and associates to turn to for help in times of distress."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although packed with social-science data, this book 
is surprisingly friendly to the lay reader -- call it Cliff Notes for policy analysts. And it's a 
bargain at $40.

<b>A Modesto Proposal</b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We can save 90 percent of all marriages in America," 
boldly asserts Michael J. McManus, an ethics and religion columnist. Considering that the 
United States is the divorce capital of the world, that sounds like a pipe dream. But McManus, a 
sort of avuncular modern-day prophet, has seen what works -- and what doesn't -- in the 
marriage-making business. Calling churches little more than "blessing machines," he takes them 
to task for what he sees as an abject failure to support and nurture marriages (see his article "Veil 
of Tears," <i>Policy Review</i>, Winter 1994).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To counter this trend, McManus has drafted a 
practical blueprint for organizing congregations to adopt a united Community Marriage Policy, a 
sort of civil compact that requires prospective newlyweds to meet minimum standards of 
preparation and marriage enrichment. The bottom line: Participating churches pledge not to 
marry couples who refuse to enroll in the premarital program. McManus reasons that, since 
almost three-quarters of first marriages take place in a religious setting, church is a strategic 
place to begin rolling back divorce rates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	McManus also encourages congregations to locate 
"mentoring couples" to help the engaged and newly married in their midst -- giving them advice 
on making their marriages and families work. "There are some 350,000 churches in America," he 
says, "and every one of the them has couples with solid marriages who've never been asked, 
trained, equipped, or inspired to do this job." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This church-based strategy is taking root -- and 
seems to be bearing fruit. In 1986, Modesto, California, became the first city to institute a 
Community Marriage Policy. Since then, about 40 towns from Fairbanks, Alaska, to 
Montgomery, Alabama, have enacted such policies. After Modesto established its Community 
Marriage Policy, divorce rates dropped by 15 percent, and Peoria, Illinois, has experienced a 20 
percent decline in its divorce rate since the churches in town signed a marriage policy in 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For a fuller explication of the Community Marriage 
Policy idea, read McManus's book, <i>Marriage Savers: Helping Your Friends and Family 
Avoid Divorce</i> (Zondervan). Marriage Savers not only spells out ideas for organizing 
churches, but also is one of the best all-around resources for anyone who wants to throw a 
lifeline to a friend, a family member, anyone who seems to be drowning in America's culture of 
divorce.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Though moralistic in tone and filled with biblical 
references, the book brims with optimism. McManus also offers a set of six videotapes based on 
the book and a study guide aimed at church groups for a total price of $199.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For more information about putting together a 
Community Marriage Policy, contact Michael J. McManus, president, Marriage Savers Institute,

<p>
<a name="show">
<b>Showcasing Success </b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Between 800 to 1,200 people in the marriage-saving 
business -- mentor couples, religious leaders, and marital therapists -- will trek to Fort Worth, 
Texas, for the Second International Marriage Enrichment Conference, May 23 through May 25. 
Designed to showcase some of the leading marriage-building techniques, the conference will 
include workshops on communication skills and marriage preparation, as well as more than 40 
seminars on topics ranging from the special needs of parents of preschoolers to maintaining 
sexual intimacy after recovery from a heart attack. The event is cosponsored by the Association 
for Couples in Marriage Enrichment (A.C.M.E.) and several other marriage groups.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For more information, contact Bobbye and Britton 
Wood, the event's coordinators in Fort Worth. Tel: 817-924-8509, fax: 817-927-7749. </i>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Woods also serve as copresidents of A.C.M.E., 
a nonprofit, nonsectarian membership organization based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 
This group was founded in 1973 by David and Vera Mace, a husband-and-wife team of marital 
therapists. The organization also acts as an informal clearinghouse for those interested in 
marriage-renewal efforts nationwide, and promotes marital support groups in local communities. 
Consisting of more than 1,100 couples, the organization puts out a bimonthly newsletter and 
coordinates weekend retreats, skills-learning classes, and seminars.

NAACP, thousands of colleges and universities, and countless other private organizations. As Americans 
turn away from reliance on Washington, they are once again applying Yankee ingenuity by building 
private institutions to address our great cultural crises. Already we are seeing new experiments such as 
privately funded voucher programs that enable poor schoolchildren to escape inadequate public schools, 
organizations that seek to rehabilitate prisoners through religious conversion, and groups such as Promise 
Keepers that aim to instill responsibility among fathers and husbands.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I always knew what I wanted to do when I grew up: I always 
wanted to be a cop. Growing up in Boston, I admired the police and the responsibility they took for others. 
From my earliest years, when police officers helped me across the street on my way to school, they were 
strong role models. It was a natural thing for me to emulate them.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For a lot of kids today, it's not so simple. Many kids are 
alienated from the police, and their peers reinforce the alienation. Instead of seeing cops as assisting 
people, they see them as authority figures to be defied. Before many young people mature and finally 
realize that they'd like to have police careers, they already have police records. It's a tragic waste of kids 
who could have made good, even great, police officers. It's also a big problem for society because -- as 
demographers warn -- the late 1990s will bring an increase in the youth population and a likely rise in the 
crime rate.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For all these reasons, I have a dream of developing a youth 
police career path to provide the children of New York City with police role models in their developmental 
years. By exposing kids to positive interactions with police, the career path would help keep them focused 
and directed in their teen years and simultaneously ensure the police department of a stronger field of 
candidates from which to choose.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Although we would continue to reach into elementary schools 
with antidrug programs, the official police youth career path would begin with kids in their early teens, 
who could attend a youth academy for six weeks in the summer beginning at age 12. The academy would 
familiarize them with the police department and heighten their interest in police careers while giving them 
a strong dose of antidrug and antigang education. The NYPD ran a successful pilot youth academy in 
Brooklyn last summer with 150 attendees, and we've raised the funds, from private and government 
sources, to enroll a thousand attendees from all over the city this summer.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After the youth academy, we would recruit kids into the next step in a youth career path -- the Law 
Enforcement Explorers, a division of the Boy Scouts of America, open to young men and women ages 14 
to 21. Now established in 66 of the New York City police department's 97 precincts, transit districts, and 
housing service areas, the NYPD Explorers serve about 2,000 young people with a program of character 
building, citizenship training, and physical fitness. 

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While participating in the Explorers, young people could also 
attend a specialty high school for students interested in policing, fire fighting, and other public-safety 
careers. A public-safety high school, now in the early planning stages, would show young people how their 
academic work builds toward their desired careers and use examples from police and other public-safety 
agencies as teaching tools. It would also surround them with like-minded students with similar goals, 
exerting a very different and more beneficial kind of peer pressure.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NYPD is raising the qualifications for police officers this 
year, requiring candidates to have 60 college credits and to have reached the age of 22. In a continuation of 
the youth career path, students attending colleges in the City University system could serve as police 
cadets, a police internship offering college credits for working in unpaid, part-time positions with the 
NYPD. The department would also assist cadets in finding part-time paying jobs in the private security 
industry or in the New York City school security system, both of which have had difficulty in recruiting 
quality personnel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In either capacity, cadets could practice the skills of projecting 
authority, mediating conflicts, and defusing potentially violent situations. Another advantage of using them 
in the school security system -- which Mayor Giuliani is planning to place under the direction of the NYPD 
in the near future -- is that these young security guards would serve as role models to the next generation of 
young people. Unlike the cadet program we have now -- which provides stipends to 320 cadets a year out 
of city and federal funds -- this program would earn its own way. By the time the cadets were ready to 
enter the police department, they'd have a significant work history, college background, and police 
training. They would probably require less training at our police academy, and would certainly be better 
prepared for the discipline and lifestyle of police work. Our academy would thus build a police force from 
a better base of candidates.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Peer pressure leads many young people astray. In some of the 
more impoverished neighborhoods, just hanging out on the street corner can be a career path straight to 
crime. Through the police youth career path, we would offer the kids the opportunity to hang out with us. 
If we capture them early, it can make all the difference in the world. The kids get a focus and a goal, 
private security and school security get better employees, and the city gets a much better crop of candidates 
for police officers. The department would have a larger pool of minority candidates and a larger pool of 
candidates who live in the city. The very group -- teenagers and young adults -- that is predicted to cause 
all the law-enforcement problems in the late 1990s can begin to be part of the solution. In my dream, 
everybody wins.

<b><i>A Great-Books Junior College</i></b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My idea is to create a new one- or two-year junior college for 
bright students (or even not-so-bright students) to earn the education they did not receive in high school 
and won't get in college. Actually I heard this idea first from Hillel Fradkin of the Bradley Foundation. But 
it's a good one, and I think it can work.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I begin with reference to a resource of which I am painfully 
aware: a cohort of unemployed Ph.D.s of (academically) conservative bent who are well educated in the 
works of great authors. To these political philosophers could be added others in history, literature, 
languages, science, and mathematics to teach a curriculum encompassing all that is necessary and 
fundamental and currently neglected or perverted in higher education.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This junior college would draw inspiration partly from disdain 
for political correctness and dislike of the educationists' notion of "self-esteem." But it would also be 
devoted to the love of learning and powered by the enthusiasm of youth. Its graduates could go on to name 
universities with prestigious degrees, football teams, and alumni associations. At these institutions, most of 
them now tired and corrupt, they would be welcomed -- or at least tolerated -- as something fresh, new, and 
strong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	American education today is perhaps too weak even to resist 
its chosen enemies -- those who believe in quality. A new institution like this would serve a need and make 
a point. All it requires, really, is an entrepreneur.

<b><i>"Pick Up Your Room"</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This one is going to be tricky. I dream of seeing the revival of 
the institution of childhood. That would mean: Children would be taught to clean up their rooms before 
they started on the environment. Their ability to keep domestic peace would be valued over their opinions 
on world peace. A 12-year-old would own a gun only to hunt squirrels. The streets would be safe for 
children to play outside, unwatched, until dusk. They could get into scrapes with other kids without 
activating a battalion of police and social workers. Girls would be left alone to have tea parties if they 
wished, and boys to play with war toys.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the schools, teachers would be more concerned about a 
child's grades than his self-esteem. Sex would never be considered "safe." Television, even -- or especially 
-- public television, would never be considered educational. Children would address their teachers -- and 
all adults -- as Mr. and Miss, or as "Sir" and "Ma'am," and not, like impertinent phone solicitors, by their 
first names.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, a revival of the institution of childhood implies a 
revival of the institution of parenthood. Mothers and fathers might by tired, nagging, grumpy, and 
uncomprehending -- but they would be present. A baby sitter would once again be called a baby sitter and 
not a "caregiver." During the day, she would sit in furry slippers in the living room, watching soaps. She 
certainly would not be expected to hold degrees in Early Childhood Education, because nobody would 
imagine that a baby sitter could substitute for parental love, attention, and discipline.

<b><i>A Dream That Won't Die</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream is not a new one. It is now 40 years old. It is a 
dream of institutional change that will enable parents to choose the schools their children go to. It is a 
dream of a private educational industry that can  compete on equal terms with our present system of 
elementary and secondary schooling -- a governmental monopoly dominated by the teachers' unions for the 
benefit of its officials and members, not of the students.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, a parent who chooses to send his child to a private 
school is required to pay twice for his child's schooling -- once in the form of taxes and once in the form of 
tuition. This imposes a heavy burden on lower income classes and ensures that only the well-do-to are free 
to choose. We can and should remedy that inequity by allowing students who choose to go to private rather 
than public schools to receive scholarships or vouchers equal to a substantial fraction of what the state 
would have been required to spend.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No institution in our country is as technologically backward as 
schooling. We school children today just as we did 200 years ago: A teacher in a classroom instructing a 
group of students. Some schools have added computers but, in the main, have not made effective use of 
them. If we opened the gate to widespread competition, we would enjoy a dramatic change in technology. I 
cannot predict what that change would be, any more than one could have predicted the consequences of 
breaking up AT&T's monopoly on telephone service, or of inventing an elementary personal computer in a 
garage.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similarly, a widespread scholarship system of the kind I 
describe would open the door to an influx of innovative enterprises offering different kinds of schooling to 
attract customers. Faced with competition, the public schools would have to improve or close down. No 
doubt some would be unable to stand the heat, but others would rapidly improve. The result would be a 
large, creative, highly developed, private educational industry that offers schooling for every taste, plus a 
vastly improved but somewhat smaller public-school system. A widening gap between the earnings of less 
skilled and more skilled workers threatens our social cohesion; an improvement in the quality of schooling, 
especially for lower-income families and the so-called underclass, would make a major contribution to 
closing that gap.

<b><i>Private Science Funding</i></b>

<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The visionary institution builders of the last century 
bequeathed us not only orphanages and schools but observatories and research universities; not only 
institutions to uplift the unfortunate but also ones to explore the universe. Since the end of World War II, 
however, science has become dependent upon government as a funder and direct employer. The results 
have been mixed: We've enjoyed a tremendous expansion of knowledge and suffered the inevitable 
corruption spawned by the bureaucratic process, which favors the cautious, the well-known, and the 
politically connected.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fortunately, government is beginning to lose its quasi-
monopoly on scientific funding. Since the explosion of commercial opportunities in the biological sciences, 
Wall Street has become a major source of research money. Meanwhile, the new fortunes of our age, and 
some philanthropic innovators, are creating models for 21st-century scientific philanthropy.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most striking example may be the privatization of the 
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) since Congress defunded it in 1993. With money from such 
technology entrepreneurs as David Packard and William Hewlett (founders of Hewlett-Packard), Paul 
Allen (Microsoft), and Gordon Moore (Intel), the reborn Project Phoenix continues to scan the skies with 
radio telescopes, seeking signs of life.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Quite unlike bureaucracies, the rich are quirky. Their tastes in 
science may be eccentric -- witness the experiment in living known as Biosphere II. And as the MacArthur 
Foundation's "genius grants" demonstrate, they may endow trendy leftism along with innovative, cross-
disciplinary science and true iconoclasm. Such is the trade off we tolerate in exchange for dispensing with 
the application forms, the lobbying, the disciplinary boundaries, and the scientific conservatism of 
government grantmaking.

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Wealthy benefactors often have a personal interest in what 
they fund. Michael Milken suffers from prostrate cancer. His millions have energized the search for a cure, 
thanks to quick-turnaround grant-making -- a total of $25 million -- and another $4 million in philanthropic 
"venture capital" to create a consortium for pooling resources and data. I hope we shall see many more 
such experiments.

<b><i>Metropolitan Home</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our fragmented metropolitan areas have come to resemble 
battlefields where national corporations, developers, county planning boards, historical societies, 
environmental lobbies, and neighborhood groups slog it out. City planning nowadays means staking out 
one's own turf and keeping interlopers at bay, be they Wal-Mart, the builders of affordable housing, theme 
parks, or simply development in general. Some have proposed federal regulations to mandate regional 
quotas for housing or to force metropolitan cooperation. The last time we attempted top-down city 
planning was in the 1960s. These disastrous, federally funded renewal programs bulldozed neighborhoods 
and erected acres of public housing -- much of which is now dysfunctional. That is not the way.

<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps the last successful effort to improve American cities 
was the nationwide movement for civic amelioration during the first two decades of this century. The 
movement was spearheaded by business leaders, municipal politicians, social reformers, and architects, and 
found its chief impetus in the American Civic Association, founded in 1903. If only we could find the will 
-- and the spirit -- to develop a civic association for the 1990s.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is not about "saving the cities." Our old, decaying urban 
areas are just part of the problem. Nor is it about recreating a lost urban past. We must first recognize that 
our new metropolitan way of life will take us in new directions. A revived civic association could provide a 
vision for an urban future that seems to be missing today. It would also encourage dialogue among the 
warring metropolitan factions. I propose a national organization with local chapters, bound by the principle 
that only citizens acting locally have the power to improve their surroundings. Communities -- unlike 
markets -- don't just happen; they have to be earned.

<b><i>A Capitalist Labor Movement</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most important private institution created by American 
society in the early decades of the 20th century was the American labor movement. The greatest 
institutional need in American society as the 20th century ends is for a new labor movement.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Though the phrase "cold war" entered the English language after 
World War II, a cold war between democratic capitalism and totalitarian communism had begun decades 
before World War II and lasted for decades after it. Capitalist society won that war for political and 
military as well as economic reasons, but to the extent that victory can be stated in economic terms, it was 
the victory of capitalism's private labor movement over communism's worker state. Communism was never 
militarily defeated, and the hunger in the former communist states for Western-style political democracy is 
moderate. But eventually the most repressive regimes in history were overwhelmed by worker demands for 
the abundance enjoyed by the West.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, the condition of Western workers is in steady 
deterioration for reasons that the early labor movement would be incapable of addressing. Capital is 
organized across national boundaries; labor is not. In an unequal contest, labor grows more disorganized 
and weaker in the West, most especially in the United States, with each passing year. Wages stagnate, 
benefits are eliminated, the work week lengthens, safety conditions worsen.

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, capital scours the world for the cheapest, most 
disorganized, most easily exploited labor -- including child labor, prison labor, and even outright slave 
labor. Unless this deterioration can be arrested, we may see once again the desperate conditions that in the 
late 19th century made the worker state seem a reasonable alternative.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What would a new capitalist labor movement -- private, just as the 
first one was private -- look like? I don't know, but thanks to mutual funds and pension plans, stockholders 
and workers are increasingly the same people.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new stockholders have not found a way to collectivize 
and mobilize their capital on behalf of themselves as, simultaneously, labor. If they could do this, they 
might be seen as creating a new kind of labor movement. The strike would not be the tool of choice for this 
labor movement; but if the movement could impose its will in other ways, the middle class that the first 
labor movement played so large a part in creating might begin to recover from its current, precipitous 
decline.

<b><i>Hand Up for Homeless</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Bill Williams was living in the alleys of Long Beach this time 
last year. He was well educated and had exceptional verbal skills, but used his "smarts" to do little jobs 
until he had enough money to buy his drugs for the day. He would "zone out," promising himself that 
tomorrow he would change. This went on for three years.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Finally, one day he called "Info Line" and was told about 
P.A.T.H. (People Assisting the Homeless) in West Los Angeles. He lied about having been drug free for 30 
days and was admitted to Phase I of P.A.T.H.'s residential program.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today he is an account executive at a publication called 
Senior Life. He has his own apartment and drives a company car.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today Bill Williams and hundreds like him are hard-working, 
taxpaying members of society. Why? Because representatives from churches, synagogues, and the business 
community met 10 years ago and decided that they would try to do something to help the growing numbers 
of homeless people gravitating toward the affluent Westside of Los Angeles.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Residents of the P.A.T.H. home-site are required to seek 
employment immediately. They are also obliged to keep the building clean and do their own laundry; in 
return they occupy a room in a newly remodeled building -- a safe and cheerful environment. A tight 
spending constraint limits them to a bus pass and $10 a week for incidental expenses.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Members of the P.A.T.H. community have recently learned to 
write resumés, contact potential employers, and acquire computer skills at P.A.T.H.'s Job Access Center 
located in the same building.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While at P.A.T.H., men and women (and children over four) 
live with others who are also determined to change their lives. Peer pressure and support, a small but caring 
staff, an executive director with a "staff sergeant" approach and confidence that "tough love" works -- all 
these contribute to a rehabilitation/success rate that exceeds 90 percent. P.A.T.H.'s board of directors raises 
half its budget in the private sector, and possesses the courage and vision to make P.A.T.H., as one resident 
called it, the "Rolls Royce of homeless programs."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The people who started P.A.T.H. had a dream. Prompted by 
the needs of the community, they decided to help people who had a chance to return to the mainstream. 
Other communities could emulate P.A.T.H. There are many other folks like Bill Williams who need a hand 
up, not a handout.

<b><i>Venture Capital for Charter Schools</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Suppose you believe in the continuing importance of public 
education but deplore the heavy hand of centralized school bureaucracy and reject the Progressive-era 
vision of "the one best system." What do you do? One answer is charter schools -- described by education 
historian Diane Ravitch as "semi-autonomous, public entities that are freed from most bureaucratic rule and 
regulations by state and local authorities in return for a commitment to meet explicit performance goals."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nineteen states now have laws authorizing charter schools, 
and hundreds have come into existence. Still, it's hard to get them launched; high start-up costs discourage 
all but the hardiest parents, teachers, and nonprofits. Here as elsewhere, lowering the barriers to 
entrepreneurship would pay rich dividends in the future.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I'd like to see private institutions emerge in every city to 
provide seed money, on a competitive basis, to local coalitions willing to plan and execute new kinds of 
public schools. The tax code should permit tax credits, up to a limit of (say) $100, for contributions to these 
institutions. Foundations would be important players. I wouldn't rule out public-sector contributions to 
these institutions -- but only in the form of one-time endowments.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fledgling Fund for New York City Public Education, 
while not exactly in this mold, illustrates the possibilities. Of an applicant pool of about 175 would-be 
educational innovators, according to the New York Times, "at least 10 will be awarded start-up grants of 
about $125,000 each, paid in installments over three years." Many others will get technical assistance. And 
dozens of new coalitions, catalyzed by the possibility of early assistance, may choose to proceed even 
without it.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While the debate over vouchers rages across the ideological 
battlefront, can't we come together around the modest but important goal of liberating entrepreneurial 
energy within the public-school sector?

<b><i>A College for My Children</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Inevitably, my most cherished dream involves my three children.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I'd like to believe that by the time they're ready for college 
(the oldest is now nine) there might be a college worth attending, without threatening their sanity and 
decency with the current mania for politically correct lies. There's simply not enough time for my kids to 
count on the sweeping changes that are desperately needed in virtually all the institutions of higher 
education in this country. But we do have a chance to capture (or even to create) one elite college or 
university as a haven and an example.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To accomplish this, traditionalists and conservatives must 
organize and pool their resources. Last year, when Yale University arrogantly returned a $20 million gift to 
Lee Bass because that donation would have required a focus on Western civilization as uniquely worthy of 
attention, I decided that my alma mater could henceforth do without my own modest contributions.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Instead, I would like to combine those resources with funds 
from thousands of other disillusioned university alumni who want to establish an alternative to the trendy, 
libertine, left-wing hegemony of the Ivy League. It's time that loyal graduates of Harvard and Stanford (not 
to mention Vassar and Amherst) woke up to the fact that their admirable and instinctive support for 
institutions that once nurtured them involves not only a tragic waste of money, but the continued 
endorsement of the most destructive forces in American life. Corporations must also recognize that their 
huge contributions to elite educational institutions are funding attitudes and activities that undermine the 
very survival of the free-enterprise system.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those who dissent from the prevailing statist and relativist 
pieties should assemble their resources and use that power to steer one selected institution in a more 
positive direction. Maybe $20 million wasn't enough to influence Yale, but let's try raising the ante, and 
focus on a somewhat smaller target -- say, for the sake of argument, Dartmouth or Williams (two gorgeous 
campuses!). It should be possible at least to install a new administration at an appropriate campus that 
would mobilize the forces of the market and offer a first-class conservative/moderate alternative to the 
prevailing folly. With 30 or 40 elite institutions hewing to an identical left-wing line, wouldn't one 
university, positioned self-consciously toward the right, enjoy an instant competitive advantage, attracting 
the finest students and faculty? And speaking of faculty, if corporations could be persuaded to endow 
chairs generously, think of the intellectual dream team that might be assembled under one academic roof. 
Perhaps one could lure away the brilliant fellows of <a href="/heritage">Heritage</a> (or AEI or Hoover 
or Cato) for a few years of inspired teaching. How about Bill Bennett as president? For key academic

	The remarkable achievements of little Hillsdale College -- in remotest rural Michigan, with only 
1,200 students and no graduate school -- give some indication of the potential for this scheme. Under the 
inspired leadership of President George Roche, Hillsdale has pursued a courageous conservative path, 
refusing all government aid and exerting surprising national influence. It is also earning a constantly 
improving reputation for academic excellence. If no established "big name" campus can be successfully 
coopted, with priceless assets of atmospheric mystique and proud traditions (which are being trashed every 
day), then the resources accumulated for that purpose might well be pumped into the Michigan institution 
to enable it to step boldly into the academic major leagues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Looking at higher education today, there's an obvious 
opportunity. It makes no market sense for every elite institution to target students and professors with the 
same liberal values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By the same token, it makes no market sense for every TV 
network, or news division, or movie studio, to target precisely the same consumers of popular culture. 
There should be room for more wholesome, more conservative alternatives, and money to by made by 
offering them -- but that's another dream. . . .

<b><i>Public-Private Job Training</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If, as President Reagan said, "the best social program devised 
is a job," then those without jobs, or without the skills that employers demand, need some help to acquire 
those skills and join productive society. We need programs that work with the private sector to provide 
well-constructed and economical training in job skills. The best example of this that I know of is "Jobs for 
America's Graduates" (JAG).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	JAG grew out of the successful "Jobs for Delaware's 
Graduates" (JDG), a program I created in 1979 while governor of Delaware. JDG, a nonprofit partnership 
charged with preparing, counseling, and placing high-school seniors in career jobs, was so successful that it 
spawned JAG for the purpose of spreading Delaware's success throughout the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Having helped 175,000 young people, JAG today is one of the 
largest organizations of its kind, and one of the most successful. Ninety percent of the at-risk young people 
enrolled in JAG graduate from school, and within nine months, the proportion that has found a job, enlisted 
in the military, or enrolled in post-secondary education or training is 80 percent -- 30 percentage points 
above the results for non-JAG youths with similar profiles. JAG achieves these results at a cost of just 
$1,200 per participant, less than one-third the average cost of similar programs around the nation. The 
taxes paid by the participants upon joining the workforce more than pay for the program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	JAG works because it is overseen by and responsible to the 
private sector, because its leaders are accountable for results, and because the young people themselves 
must meet the employability standards of businesses and take charge of their lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Supporting America's youth, reducing the cost of social 
programs, and protecting the future base of our taxpayers are good, sound, conservative principles. As we 
approach the 21st century, "Jobs for America's Graduates" puts these principles to work.

<b><i>Report Cards for Schools</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Colin Powell went to public school in the Bronx. Like so 
many other Americans, he owes his start in life to that great institution, free public education. But today, 
not all schools give kids enough chance to succeed. At some public schools in the Bronx, textbooks are in 
such short supply that children have to share in class, and afterward the books are collected and sent down 
the hall to another waiting class. Are spending cuts to blame for the shortage? No.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	From 1980 to 1993, for example, spending on New York City 
public schools increased 148 percent, even though the number of students increased only 3 percent. Even 
after taking inflation into account, New York City spent 37 percent more per pupil in 1993 than in 1980.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Spending on central administration grew almost five times as 
fast as spending for regular classroom teaching. Too much of our education funds went for bureaucrats, not 
books; administrators, not educators; red tape, not learning aids.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The problem is not merely citywide, it is statewide: From 
1980 to 1993, school enrollment in New York declined by 9 percent, but spending shot up by 142 percent. 
School districts spent more and more and taxed local residents again and again. Yet many teachers have to 
reach into their own pockets to pay for classroom supplies.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is not to spend more, but to spend more wisely. A 
school report card would help parents and taxpayers hold school boards accountable for how our scarce 
education dollars are spent and how well students perform. School boards should be required to publish 
one annually on every school under their purview, with figures on spending per pupil and students' 
performance on standardized tests. Parents and taxpayers have a right to know how their schools stack up 
and whether their education dollars are producing results.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	School report cards should be a new addition to an important 
American institution -- public school. Parents, taxpayers, and teachers need to hold school boards and 
elected officials accountable for spending, so that scarce education dollars are used wisely to give every 
child a chance in life.

<b><i>Faithful Professions</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Writing of Americans in the early 19th century, Tocqueville 
observed not that they were great institution-builders nor that they were great organizers, but that they had 
mastered the "science of association," which he thought necessary to the maintenance of civil society itself. 
He chose the term "association" carefully, for it invokes not just the structure through which individuals act 
together, but also the very act of coming together and, for Tocqueville especially, the community of 
opinion and sentiment that collective action at once depends upon and helps to form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I note this because for each of my "dreams," the need is 
clearer than the institutional or organizational means of addressing it. First, I think that achieving peace in 
our current culture wars depends on transcending the hostility toward religion that now seems entrenched 
in the secular professions: law, medicine, journalism, teaching. As a first step, perhaps like-minded 
individuals within the ranks of each profession would associate, dedicated to informing their professional 
activities with the witness of their religious faith. Whether or not such association begins among members 
of the same church or denomination -- though the movement might be stronger if it does -- it must become 
ecumenical, or federative, if it is to succeed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My second hope is that society reestablish respect for the 
vocation of mothers and dissolve the pernicious, ubiquitous social pressure upon mothers to leave their 
children with someone else and go make money. Here the organizational means to the end seem even more 
elusive -- a "Home Makers" on the model of "Promise Keepers" doesn't quite seem fitting -- although the 
freedom of mothers to nourish and nurture requires fathers to resume their duty to provide and protect. 
These tasks involve in no small part recovering the wisdom once embedded in tradition now abandoned, 
and then bringing that wisdom to life in contemporary circumstances. In this, the current wave of 
institution-building differs from the Progressive urge to remake society in the then-clear light of modern 
science, but it also recalls in a way the task that faced Tocqueville's Americans as they marched across an 
untamed continent, bringing civilization as they knew it to a savage land.

<b><i>Motor Trend for Schools</i></b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Twenty years from now, the failures of government-run 
schools will be so obvious that America will have either moved to a voucher system or else be in the 
process of doing so. Yet there are no final victories in politics, so friends of educational choice must work 
over the next 20 years to create a civic infrastructure to nurture this new design for freedom. All Americans 
-- not just parents -- ought to be able to trust that fraud in the educational marketplace will be punished, 
and that educational incompetence will be identified, so that parents can choose to take their children 
elsewhere. Yet because the workings of the invisible hand are so alien to education, voluntary nonprofit 
groups simply must be part of this process.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Inspired perhaps by Margaret Thatcher's prochoice reforms, 
the British government publishes "League Tables," which rate school performance nationwide. Such 
watchdogging can be useful, but the experience of "Goals 2000" in the past six years reminds American 
conservatives that politicians can abuse or even invert any assessment function left in their control.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So America circa 2016 will need a range of nongovernmental 
entities rating schools' performance by various criteria and publicizing their findings. For years, Americans 
have relied on Consumer Reports to help them evaluate everything from potholders to pickup trucks. And 
Money and Motor Trend, to name just two magazines, have both carved out commercial niches for 
themselves as guides to investments and automobiles, respectively. Yet because education will always be 
more than just a commodity, those who would lead America to a renaissance of citizenship should 
encourage religious, fraternal, and neighborhood groups—whether or not they themselves choose to 
participate in the voucher-driven education market—to issue their own report cards on school performance.

<b><i>Group Homes for Welfare Moms</i></b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The best way to reform welfare, as I suggested in <i>The 
Dream and the Nightmare</i> in 1993 and in a series of articles since, requires the creation of a new 
institution -- a national network of communal hostels, or group homes, for welfare mothers and their 
children. Such hostels would focus on the welfare of children, not the job prospects of young women. The 
hostels would provide structured, caring environments for nurturing citizens with consciences and the 
ability to learn. By the time today's underclass children are in Head Start, let alone school, it's very late to 
begin teaching the cognitive and moral categories that are learned in early childhood, that families 
normally teach, and that underclass children don't adequately acquire. Without mastery of these categories, 
it is hard to think, to apply yourself, and therefore to learn.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The hostels should have rules of conduct for the mothers who 
live there, to help them get control of their lives, but above all to ensure the order and structure children 
need. In the same vein, the hostels should require mothers to take daily workshops in child rearing to learn 
some of the basics that young underclass women often don't know: that babies cry because they have 
needs, not because they are "bad"; that children need to be talked to and responded to, not ignored and not 
hit, if they are to grow up able to function as members of society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No doubt such a system will discourage many unmarried 
women unable to support babies from having them -- a worthwhile result. No less important, the smaller 
number of babies born under such circumstances, despite all of society's discouragement, will get a fair 
chance to grow up happy and productive citizens. However sweeping this reform, it must be weighed 
against today's dreadful welfare system, which condemns millions of children to grow up with so much 
human talent unawakened, lost to themselves and to society.

<b><i>A Religious Reawakening</i></b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most of our nation's great problems stem from a decline in 
morality. A string of unbalanced federal budgets nearly four decades long reflects a moral failure to live 
within our means. A rapidly growing $5-trillion national debt evinces the immorality of one generation 
imposing an unpardonable burden on future generations to pay for what essentially amounts to bread and 
circuses. The pretense of the charity of the welfare state represents our immoral struggle to live at the 
expense of others. Part and parcel of this welfare state is the intergenerational extortion of the young and 
yet-to-be-born by older Americans through Social Security and Medicare. Then there is the politics of 
"entitlement" that has spawned unprecedented dependency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Governments cannot patch up the public and private 
imprudence that scars the modern American landscape. The ameliorative action government can take is to 
eliminate those programs and laws that have undermined traditional values and morality. Just as language 
evolved intrinsically, without government direction or control, so did moral or ethical standards. Honesty, 
restraint, self-reliance, and social cooperation evolved as standards because they produced greater 
tranquillity and generated more wealth than their counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Much of our moral code has religious roots. Government 
attack on religion, under the contrivance of adhering to the "Establishment Clause," has played an 
important role in the decline of morality. It is religious teachings that bolster the moral standards against 
lying, treachery, deceit, fornication, adultery, confiscation, and instant gratification. Religion promotes 
loyalty to family, friends, and community. Marxists and those in America who see the state as supreme find 
moral relativism far more friendly to their agenda than the absolutism of religion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream of an American moral reawakening will reduce 
both the size and scope of problems we now call on government to solve. The problems that remain will be 
dealt with more compassionately through family, social organizations, and community as they were for 
most of our history.

<b><i>Work Requirements for Public Housing</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream is that sometime soon, the billions of dollars 
invested in public-housing bricks and mortar will be transformed into the sites of regenerated central-city 
working neighborhoods. There is reason to believe we have the ability to bring about such a change. Right 
now, although not a desirable place to live for most families, public housing embodies a large public 
subsidy to each family who benefits from it, equal in many instances to the monthly AFDC cash grant 
itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But although the cash value of a public-housing subsidy 
makes it a boon of sorts, free or almost free housing fosters an attitude that one's apartment unit, and by 
extension the surrounding project, are not worth the effort of maintaining standards. Destructive behaviors 
by residents and those in the surrounding community reinforce and reflect this attitude.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I envision reforms to require work as a condition of living in 
public housing, either in the private sector or in a community-service job to improve one's housing site or 
perform other neighborhood building activities. In the welfare-reform field, we have discovered the power 
of universal work requirements and expectations. In the current environment, individuals improving their 
lives through work are isolated and demoralized by those in the larger dependent environment around 
them. But public-housing sites have the potential to create a controlled physical space where expectations 
of work are enforced. For the formerly idle, enforced work initially may not be pleasant, but at least 
everybody will find themselves in the same boat.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beginning in March, residents of Milwaukee's largest public-
housing project will receive welfare payments only in proportion to required work completed; over time, 
this work requirement will be a condition of their lease as well. Fashioning work requirements to improve 
and build urban communities of the future will be our major challenge.

<b><i>New TV Shows</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	First, I propose two television productions. One would be 
called America's Legal Nightmares, and would expose myriad real-life instances of citizens persecuted by 
the state -- by the EPA, for example, or by Child Protection Services. The second, American Stories, is 
Michael Medved's companion idea; this program would celebrate individuals who have transcended 
personal hardships.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, before we can launch any systematic efforts to develop 
private charity, we must establish a reliable, independent referee of charities' effectiveness and reliability. 
The few organizations that track private charities lack the resources to follow any but the largest ones. 
When they evaluate a charity's finances, they must rely on its own accounting, for which the rules are 
notoriously lax and potentially misleading. We need to establish explicit financial reporting standards for 
501(c)(3) public charities and fund organizations both to evaluate and rate them by Marvin Olasky's 
criteria of effective compassion, and disseminate these findings, perhaps on the Internet.

<b><i>A Revival Parallel to the Evangelicals</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklink.html">Russell Kirk</a> 
wrote, culture arises from the cult. Nonreligious people can be good people, as many a Stoic proved. But 
there never were very many Stoics. Human nature being what it is, most people need a religious foundation 
for their morals, if their morals are to be sound. Only the Transcendent has power enough to overcome 
their natural inclination to "do their own thing."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It follows that if America's culture is to be rescued from the 
sewer into which it has fallen, we need a revival of religion. In theory, a number of religions offer a sound 
moral basis; it should be no surprise that the Confucian cultures of East Asia believe we could learn some 
things from them. But it is difficult to envision Confucianism or another non-Christian religion suddenly 
sweeping America. For reasons of history, if a religious revival is to happen here, it will be Christian. The 
choice is that or nothing.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such a revival has in fact been under way for some time, 
spearheaded by the Protestant Evangelicals. They have done fruitful work, and the fact that there is any 
resistance at all to the destroyers of our culture is largely their doing. However, much of the citizenry 
remains beyond their reach. For many reasons, these people are uncomfortable with either the Evangelical 
message or the Evangelical style. No one is at fault for this; it is a fact of life that people differ.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I dream of an effort parallel to the Protestant Evangelical 
revival, not in competition with it. Both would be aimed at the unchurched, not each other.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The new effort would be led by a real new order; a new religious 
order, similar to older orders such as the Benedictines, the Cistercians, and the like. It would be liturgical, 
apostolic, and sacramental, but it would not be part of any of the four churches with those characteristics 
(the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and orthodox remnants of the Anglicans and Scandinavian 
Lutherans). It would be supported by all of them, it would draw from all of them, and it would be 
recognized as legitimate by all of them. But the key difference is that it would not require anyone to join 
any organization to partake of a liturgical and sacramental religious life led by clergy who were part of the 
apostolic succession. In our sad times, it is probably necessary to say that this new order would adhere 
rigorously to the creeds and the doctrines of the Church as laid down and universally accepted before the 
split of 1054 a.d. And it would preach and practice, within the limits of human frailty, traditional Christian 
morals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It would dismiss with complete disinterest all the turf fights, 
jurisdictional squabbles, historic slights, and other ephemera that stand between the liturgical, apostolic, 
and sacramental church and people hungry for that church. It would thus bolster the sound elements, not 
only within our own culture, but in other nations as well.
