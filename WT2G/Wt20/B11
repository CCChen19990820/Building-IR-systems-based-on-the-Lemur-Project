Answer to the question.  You needn't post if academies weren't included.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some SDA schools (and Columbia Union College in particular) have large </i><br>
<i>&gt; enough minority populations that (Anglo) parents do not want to send </i><br>
<i>&gt; their children there and are sending them to other colleges instead.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1)  Is this happening at any local SDA schools that you know of?</i><br>
<p>
Is this supposed to include academies as well?  There was a dwindling<br>
white population at Takoma Academy (where I attended 4 years ago).<br>
They often went to Highland View or Shenandoah boarding academies <br>
instead though.  TA, located within the DC beltway, is becoming more<br>
and more of an inner city school.  I think the reasoning stemmed quite <br>
a bit from that.  Kinda the idea of, if you have the money, keep the<br>
kids out of the higher danger zone.<br>

In the past few months, a conversation with a high-level church administrator<br>
on the topic of race relations yielded the following point:<br>
<p>
Some SDA schools (and Columbia Union College in particular) have large <br>
enough minority populations that (Anglo) parents do not want to send <br>
their children there and are sending them to other colleges instead.<br>
<p>
Questions:<br>
<p>
1)  Is this happening at any local SDA schools that you know of?<br>
<p>
2)  If it is happening, is it due to racism or just white SDA's abandoning <br>
SDA schools all together?<br>

I just heard the same report about a shootout between <br>
federal agents and a heavily armed "cult group" in Waco,<br>
Texas.  Apparently 4 agents and at least one group member<br>
were killed.  The group is the Branch Davidians, and the <br>
confrontation apparently started when agents tried to arrest<br>
the leader, Vernon Howell, for violation of gun control laws.  <br>
The report did identify this group as an offshoot of the SDA <br>
church.  Hopefully someone else knows more...<br>

After giving info to the list last evening, I went home and watched the<br>
news.  It appears that it was not the Davidian SDA's that were involved<br>
in the shootout, but the Branch Davidians.  This appears to be the group<br>
listed in Melton's encyclopedic work as the Branch SDAs (p. 513), who<br>
have a po address in Waco, TX.  This is merely a splinter of a splinter<br>
(the Davidians, or "Shepherd's Rod").<br>

I have not heard the news, but yesterday there was an article in the<br>
paper about this.  They identified the cult as Davidians, a branch offshoot<br>
of the 7th day Adventist church, that moved it's headquarters to waco in<br>
1935.  The current leader, claims that he is Christ.  The cult was heavily<br>
armed, and belives that thier 24 year old leader is the only one who can<br>
open the 7 seals of revalation.  He claims to have been married since 1984<br>
and has 2 children.  However, former members of the cult, say that he has<br>
bragged about having sex with underaged children, and has fathered many<br>
of the commune's children.  I was going to post the entire contents of the<br>
article, but left it at home.  Last night was the pits.  I worked about<br>
6 hours trying to straighted up the plumbing in my house, and still don't<br>
have water, so was quite tired and distracted this morning.<br>
<p>
Cheers<br>

Yesterday when I read all the comments about a shootout in Texas I can't<br>
say I was expecting to hear any more about it than what I'd heard on the<br>
net. But cult violence is cult violence and has worldwide appeal. So when<br>
I watched the news last night (Monday) I was interested to note that there<br>
was some time spent on the issue. (I didn't notice any associations of the<br>
group to SDAs though.)<br>
<p>
What I did notice was that it was of particular interest to Australians<br>
because there were two Australians amongst the group. They showed pictures<br>
of these twins Nicole and Peter, then they showed an interview with the<br>
leader from last year (claiming he was Christ and talking about guns etc)<br>
then they came back to "the Gents" - the parents of Nicole and Peter. <br>
<p>
That was when it hit me. I knew Nicole.<br>
<p>
I don't usually see people that I know on the 6 o'clock news! Nicole<br>
was a first year student at Avondale College with me in 1987. She lived<br>
just down the hall in the dormitory. I have a picture of her in my<br>
photo album, sitting with a whole bunch of other girls in my room.<br>
<p>
Then she left College. No one could talk her out of going. We all wondered<br>
how we had failed her. One girl took a worship one night talking about<br>
Nicole and saying how she would show real interest in spiritual things and<br>
ask deep questions but everyone was too busy being superficial and trendy to<br>
take any of that seriously.<br>
<p>
So now I hear of Nicole again - and I feel a bit shook-up!<br>
<p>
Does anyone else know anyone caught up in such a thing?<br>
Why do people get involved in such groups?<br>
<p>

Some time ago Lola asked why individuals go to the seminary when they<br>
don't want to.  I asked several seminary students who work in my<br>
department, and this is some of what I heard.  There are several aspects<br>
to this situation, and these are some of them.<br>
<p>
The first is, Is the ministry a calling or a profession?  If it is only<br>
a calling, and professional training is not necessary (and this is the<br>
position of some individuals and even of some conferences--obviously<br>
including Kentucky)--then why go to the seminary.  However, I believe<br>
there are good reasons to consider the ministry both a calling and a<br>
profession.  A person can feel called to work in the legal field, but<br>
certainly won't become a lawyer without a degree and passing the bar.<br>
We've tried to have it both ways in the church, but the trend has been<br>
toward requiring professional training--you can't become a doctor<br>
without an M.D. and you can't become a minister without an M.Div.  This<br>
is not to say that these degrees guarantee adequate professional<br>
practice, but they should guarantee that an individual has learned the<br>
basics of the profession.  This is also not to say that an individual<br>
can't "minister" without a professional degree, what it does say is that<br>
they aren't a "professional clergyperson" with a "union card."  Of<br>
course this gets further confused when ordination (which is what really<br>
matters) can be gotten without the professional degree, and unlike in<br>
many professions, hiring organizations don't require it.  There has been<br>
some attempt by the seminary to give a degree "in the field" to those<br>
without it.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure I'm qualified to comment on whether or not what they learn<br>
in their academic program is worth learning.  However, I can state that<br>
being a minister in these days is a very complex job, and it would<br>
appear to be very useful to have a working knowledge of a number of<br>
branches of knowledge (including psychology and management) in addition<br>
to the more "theological" disciplines.  In recent years greater<br>
attention has been paid to trying to integrate the curricula of the<br>
college religion programs with that of the seminary so that there is<br>
less duplication, that students are adequately prepared for the<br>
seminary, and that the whole thing is more like one seamless program.<br>
But the basic question remains:  Is there a basic core of knowledge that<br>
all clergy should know? and of course the related, Are they getting it<br>
with the current program.<br>
<p>
My personal observation is that many seminary students don't seem<br>
grateful that the church (at great expense) has given them this<br>
opportunity at a bargain-basement cost (very low tuition/costs, and<br>
often living expenses).  Those of us who have had to pay for our own<br>
advanced education find this hard to understand.  Some really don't seem<br>
to have the ability and/or desire to learn.  Others find it inconvenient<br>
to move to a distant location for their education.  Others have what I<br>
call "center of the universe" mentality--I already live at the center of<br>
universe, why should I spend 2 years in that snowbank?  Yet others for<br>
whatever reason don't find the content/quality of the education to their<br>
liking.  So you can see, it leaves lots of room for bitching!<br>
<p>
Well, this has been more of a stream of consciousness monologue, but<br>
those are a few of my thoughts.<br>

<i>&gt;All this talk about laws I find interesting!  I am currently doing resurch</i><br>
<i>&gt;to write a 7 to 10 page paper on Romans 6:12-14.  The vs. 14 states that</i><br>
<i>&gt;we are no longer under law [at all] but under grace.  I have been stuck on</i><br>
<i>&gt;that more than any other part of the verses.  I'm not sure how to take</i><br>
<i>&gt;that.  Reference to Ex. 20? or all of the OT laws  or what?  (at all was</i><br>
<i>&gt;added for my emphases)</i><br>
<p>
What would happen if we asked a well studied orthodox Jew to set asside<br>
his Jewish biases against Christian and then to take Paul's Greek and<br>
translate this passage of scripture into English.<br>
<p>
The Greek used is Nomos, which our hypothetical Orthodox Jew would<br>
translate into Torah.  "We are not under the Torah . . . ."  Consider<br>
Paul's audiance and Jewish custom and we see that Paul is saying that<br>
"we are not under the system of Jewish Torah", that is, as Christians<br>
we are not under the entire system of Jewish law.  Torah/Nomos does<br>
not mean Ten Commandments.  Torah translates "revelation".  It has an<br>
entirely different meaning than "law" means to modern Christians.  It<br>
means the entire system of Jewish practice.<br>
<p>
For example:  On one hand the Sadducees insisted that Torah was nothing<br>
more nor less than the books of Moses taken at face value.  On the other<br>
hand the Pharisees insisted insisted on far more, even to the point<br>
that a Rabinical student could come up with something profound that<br>
would be accepted as something that God had said to Moses at Mt. Sinaii.<br>
This was the oral law.  Torah = law of Moses + the traditions past<br>
and future of the Oral law.  Part of this oral law included over 1000<br>
statements on how the Sabbath was to be kept.<br>
<p>
Here is a passage of scripture that shows that Paul taught a distinction<br>
between Jewish Torah and God's Torah:<br>
<p>
     "and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those who<br>
     are  under  the law [nomos], as under the law [nomos], that I might win<br>
     those who are under the law [nomos]; "to  those  who  are  without  law<br>
     [anomos],  as  without  law  [anomos]  (not  being without law [anomos]<br>
     toward God, but under law [ennomos] toward Christ), that  I  might  win<br>
     those  who  are without law [anomos]; "  --  1 Cor 9:20, 21  (NKJ) (NIV<br>
     similar)<br>
<p>
To me it is clear that Paul is saying that we are not under the  Torah/Nomos<br>
of Judaism and yet we are under the Torah/Nomos of God.  To insist that Paul<br>
tosses out the baby with the bath water is  to  insist  that  this  text  in<br>
Corinthians  is incomprehensible, or at least contradictory.  Is Paul speak-<br>
ing nonsense, or does this text make clear that Paul  does  not  dispose  of<br>
God's  law as some would have us believe.  Note again 1 Cor 7:19 -- "Circum-<br>
cision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping of the commandments<br>
of  God is what counts."  Also --  "What shall we say, then?  Shall we go on<br>
sinning so that grace may increase?  By no means!  We died to sin;  how  can<br>
we  live  in  it  any longer?"  (Rom. 6:1,2)  Paul and other NT writers make<br>
clear that sin is the transgression of God's law (Rom. 4:15;  1  John  3:4).<br>
And  so  we  must search out what is the Torah law of God as being something<br>
quite apart from the Torah law of the Pharisees.  Certainly, we would<br>
agree that the Ten Commandments is part of God's law.  And we would agree<br>
that the majority of Jewish traditional practice (Torah/Nomos/Law) is not<br>
part of "God's Law".  The fullness of God's law, found in the Bible, is for<br>
each of us to search out.<br>
<p>
     "They worship me in vain; their teachings are but the  commandments  of<br>
     men.   You have let go of the commandments of God and are holding on to<br>
     the traditions of men.  And he said to them: traditions!"  (Mark 7:7-9)<br>
<p>
Jesus also said He did not come to change even the punctuation of  the  law.<br>
He kept God's law perfectly and yet did not subscribe to the traditions.  "I<br>
know that his commandments lead to everlasting life.  Whatever I say is what<br>
the Father has told me to say."  (John 12:50)  His coming here to this earth<br>
did not change even the punctuation of  [God's]  law.<br>
<p>
The baby must not go out with<br>
the bathwater and Paul does not do so.  This becomes clear  if  we  discover<br>
Paul's enthusiasm for God's law (Rom 7:12, 22, etc).<br>
<p>
At the same time, it is not law keeping, even of God's Law, by which we earn<br>
salvation  but rather because we Love Him who died while we were yet sinners<br>
with rags for righteousness.  To make light of that in disobedience of  what<br>
He would have us to do is to assume our salvation presumptuously.<br>
<p>
     "If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love; even as I have<br>
     kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.  (John 15:10)<br>
<p>
Let Him be our perfect example, even in how He kept the Law of God.<br>
<p>

Hi Steven,<br>
  Sorry to bother you with this, but, I just wonder if you or<br>
anyone else on SDAnet has the most up-to-date listing of FTP<br>
sites and mail servers<br>
Thanks<br>

In the month of February we put 254 messages through SDAnet, an all-time<br>
record.  We lost several subscribers in the process who couldn't take the<br>
traffic.  I don't plan to have that much traffic every month.<br>
You may notice that several times in the past few days I've skipped <br>
the morning mailing.  This saves time for me and traffic for you,<br>
because the more messages arrive the more people respond to.  Traffic <br>
breeds traffic.<br>
<p>
Those who are still digging out from the backlog of last month's messages,<br>
there is still the weekly digest which gives the traffic to you in four<br>
humungous weekly chunks rather than 254 separate messages.  Bear this in<br>
mind.  And for the creative and fertile who want less traffic, SDA-L<br>
is a blank slate waiting for someone to do something with it.<br>
<p>
But I hope all of you stay on, and join us in the next exciting chapters<br>
of SDAnet.  The board is working hard on technical issues, and we hope<br>
to have a bunch of improvements soon, perhaps even shorter opening headers!<br>
<p>

Have you tried the Archie server that was developed out of McGill U in<br>
Canada.  I forget how to actually talk to one of the archie servers.  We<br>
have links to it in our gopher server that I use.  If you know what you<br>
are looking for you can try searching for it with archie.<br>
<p>
If you can't find archie or a gopher search option, you can telnet to<br>
edmund.cs.andrews.edu and login in as library (there is no password).<br>
This will put you directly into gopher.  Option 10 from the top level<br>
menu is searches.  From the searches menu, you can search for an exact<br>
name with option 1 or a substring match in option 7.  I use option 7,<br>
the substring match myself, just in case there are version numbers<br>
tacked on the end or something.<br>

I found it interesting to read Harvey's comments about various attitudes<br>
held by seminary students. It seems that some things are the same no <br>
matter which half of the world you live in (at least in Western society).<br>
<p>
At Avondale College there is always a percentage of ministerial students<br>
who feel that they were called by God to minister, and so why should any<br>
academic requirement stand between them and their calling. Some of these<br>
guys find the more esoteric subjects very difficult, and many do not have<br>
a strong academic background. There are always casualties along the way,<br>
students who feel strongly called and yet can't pass Greek II or Systematic<br>
Theology or whatever.<br>
<p>
I have often wondered why God only ever seems to call people to be <br>
official church leaders. Surely a person doesn't have to have a degree<br>
to be a spiritual leader, and surely a person can be a spiritual leader<br>
without being the pastor. I would like to see some of those who feel <br>
called to be leaders take on that responsibility as best they can in<br>
their current state, whether they're plumbers or professors. A call<br>
to minister doesn't equate with a call to the seminary.<br>
<p>
Those are my thoughts, anyway. What do you think?<br>
<p>

When I contacted the General Conference Communications Dept. early<br>
Monday morning, they had already sent notices to the press disclaiming<br>
any relationship between the SDA Church and the Davidians. If you notice<br>
statements appearing in the New York Times, AP, USA Today and other<br>
media, the disclaimer reached the media in time to be included in the<br>
early reports. The Communication Dept. had contacted all major media<br>
outlets, including print and electronic. They should be commended.<br>
<p>
However, it remains to be seen if the official church will suffer<br>
by being connected in name with the story. This, of course, is of great<br>
interest to those of us in professional public relations. The church has<br>
a good name (as revealed in various national polling organizations) and<br>
I'm sure we are all jealous that it be guarded carefully. <br>
<p>
Although it is unfortunate to be connected with this story, undoubtedly<br>
most of the public see this group as a fanatical, extreme group. But <br>
isn't this the impressional of Adventism the was painted by the<br>
Australian press during the Lindy Chamberlain story? <br>

Just a comment on the Davidian cult and bad press for SDA Church.  The LDS<br>
church has suffered many times when fanatical extremist polygamist groups<br>
appear in the news.  (The cult that killed two federal agents about 3 years<br>
ago after bombing an LDS chapel. The LeBarons.)  The general public typically<br>
picks up on fanatical cults and automatically equates their views with the<br>
church from which they split.  The next time SDAs think about the LDS church<br>
and associate it with polygamist cults, remember this experience with the<br>
Davidians and the SDA Church.<br>
<p>
A thoughtful study of other churches and what they really believe will avoid<br>
a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br>

Hi people,<br>
<p>
     since there is so much interest in the shootout in Texas,<br>
i thought you would be interested in this article, which was<br>
on the front page of today's Straits Times, the main English<br>
Newspaper here in Singapore. It was also the biggest article<br>
on the front page (because of photos).<br>

4 FEDERAL AGENTS KILLED IN SHOOTOUT WITH CULT<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
Waco (Texas) - A raid on the compound of a religious cult to arrest its<br>
leader erupted into a bloody gun battle here on Sunday, leaving 4 federal<br>
agents dead and at least 15 injured.<br>
     The cult's 33-year old leader, who claims that he is the biblical<br>
Messiah, told a local radio station that one child inside the walled<br>
compound had been killed in the shootout and that several other people were<br>
hurt. But a standoff prevented any independent confirmation of his account.<br>
     The battle erupted after more than 100 agents, seeking to arrest the<br>
leader on a weapons charge, emerged from hiding in livestock trailers at<br>
about 9:30am on Sunday and entered the fortified 31-hectare compound, 16km<br>
outside Waco. The agents, caught off-guard by a hail of gunfire, retreated<br>
after 45 minutes of shooting and called for a truce to carry their dead and<br>
wounded away by ambulance and helicopter. They then negotiated with the<br>
group by phone.<br>
     Hours after nightfall, the standoff continued. David Koresh, the<br>
group's leader, said in a rambling interview with Cable News Network that<br>
he would release children in the group two by two if radio stations played<br>
his religious messages. There was no immediate response from the<br>
authorities, but federal officials said late on Sunday night that two<br>
children had left the compound.<br>
     But at 7pm, three members of the sect came out of the compound and<br>
began shooting at agents, said a spokesman for the federal Bureau of<br>
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Washington, which conducted the raid. One<br>
was killed and one captured.<br>
     Koresh told CNN that he himself had been "shot through the guts".<br>
     The bureau had been planning the raid for months and had rehearsed it<br>
several times, said Mr Ted Royster, special agent for its Dallas field<br>
office, at a news conference here on Sunday afternoon. But members of the<br>
sect, the Branch Davidians, had clearly learned of the raid in advance.<br>
     Mr Royster said "I cannot tell you what went wrong. It appeared as<br>
though they were waiting for us." He did not elaborate.<br>
     It was one of the largest operations ever mounted by the bureau, a<br>
Treasury Department agency that enforces federal law on trafficking in<br>
illegal weapons, alcohol and tobacco. And it was "the greatest loss of life<br>
ever suffered by the bureau", Mr Royster said, his voice breaking.<br>
     The battle came a day after the local newspaper, The Waco Tribune-<br>
Herald, carried a long report on the sect, calling attention to the weapons<br>
and discussing accusations by former members that Koresh sexually abused<br>
girls in the compound. Mr Royster said the timing of the raid on Sunday was<br>
not related to that report. The bureau had been investigating the cult for<br>
nearly eight months.<br>
     The federal agents had warrants to search the Davidians' compound for<br>
guns and explosives and to arrest Koresh, a musician whose followers<br>
believe that he is Jesus Christ. - NYT,UPI<br>

<p>
Well, i'm glad the article didn't mention the words "Seventh-day Adventist."<br>
Anyway, since there was so much violence and loss of life, a film will<br>
probably be made about it. <br>
     As for me, it is just another of many signs of the times about which<br>
our Lord spoke, the news is full of them, and it just means that we'd<br>
better get our act together, get cracking and let people know about God and<br>
the gospel, because there isn't much time left.<br>
<p>
Mt 24:4-14<br>
 4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive<br>
you.  5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall<br>
deceive many.  6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that<br>
ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is<br>
not yet.  7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against<br>
kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in<br>
divers places.  8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.  9 Then shall<br>
they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be<br>
hated of all nations for my name's sake. 10 And then shall many be<br>
offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 11 And<br>
many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 12 And because<br>
iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 13 But he that<br>
shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 14 And this gospel of<br>
the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all<br>
nations; and then shall the end come. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Mt 24:21-30<br>
21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning<br>
of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. 22 And except those days<br>
should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's<br>
sake those days shall be shortened. 23 Then if any man shall say unto you,<br>
Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. 24 For there shall arise<br>
false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders;<br>
insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. 25<br>
Behold, I have told you before. 26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you,<br>
Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret<br>
chambers; believe it not. 27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east,<br>
and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man<br>
be. 28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered<br>
together. 29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun<br>
be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall<br>
fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: 30 And<br>
then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all<br>
the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in<br>
the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Luke 21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and<br>
lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Matt 28:19-20 19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in<br>
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20 Teaching<br>
them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am<br>
with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. (KJV)<br>

This was even mentioned (in German) on the German short-wave station<br>
Deutsche Welle.  However, there was no reference to the Seventh-day<br>
Adventist Church.<br>

A call to serve does not necessarily mean a call to the organized church<br>
work.  I agree with Tony.<br>
How long are we lay people going to leave ministry up to the few?  They<br>
seem to have forgotten that ALL Christians are gifted ministers--or at<br>
least should be.  We the lay people have bought into their understanding<br>
and see ourselves as benchwarmers and givers of offering.  <br>
Nothing is farther from the New Testament truth.<br>
<p>
Yours for a whole church.<br>

Hi people,<br>
<p>
     I sent in a front page article from today's Straits Times<br>
about the Texan happenings. Apparently there's more stuff about it<br>
on page 8, which i didn't notice earlier. Here it is:<br>
     There are 2 articles in a big box occupying most of the page,<br>
the box is labelled "Shootout in Texas".<br>
<p>
NO WAY IN: Federal agent retreats in face of fire<br>
(some sequential pictures of an armed man on a roof failing to get<br>
in through a window and being shot at instead)<br>
<p>
CULT WELL-ARMED TO DEAL WITH ATTACK BY OUTSIDERS<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
WACO (Texas) - Members of the apocalyptic Branch Davidians cult<br>
were well-prepared for any assault by outsiders, a local newspaper<br>
which had been investigating the group said. The Waco Herald-<br>
Tribune discovered that the cult's followers had a large arsenal of<br>
high-powered weapons.<br>
     And they routinely held paramilitary exercises at their<br>
heavily fortified 31-ha Mount Carmel farm which even had a watch<br>
tower.<br>
     On sunday, about 100 federal agents found out just how well-<br>
prepared the cult was. When the officers, who were wearing bullet-<br>
proof vests, tried to storm the cult's buildings, they were beaten<br>
back by a hail of gunfire which killed four agents and wounded at<br>
least 15 others.<br>
     And later, a spokesman from the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and<br>
Firearms (ATF), which organised the raid, confirmed that at least<br>
one agent had been hit by gunfire from a 50-calibre machine gun<br>
normally used against tanks and aircraft.<br>
     Two of the three helicopters used during the raid were also<br>
hit by gunfire, apparently from a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle.    <br>
The cult is also believed to have explosives on the farm.<br>
     The branch Davidians has its origins in Los Angeles, where<br>
founder Victor Houteff split from the Seventh-day Adventist church<br>
in 1933.<br>
     Mr Houteff, a Bulgarian immigrant, left a teaching position<br>
with the church because of conflicts over his theological views,<br>
notably his interpretation of the Book of Revelation.<br>
     In Waco, he established the original Mount Carmel Centre and<br>
preached that the second coming of Christ was only a year away,<br>
according to Baylor University religion professor Bill Pitts, who<br>
has written several papers on the cult.<br>
     Even though the years passed without incident, Mr Houteff's<br>
following totalled more than 1000 by the time he died in 1955.<br>
     His wife, Florence, took over the leadership, predicting that<br>
April 22, 1959 would mark the end of the world.<br>
     When the date came and went, the group split, with most<br>
choosing to follow rival prophet Ben Roden and his new<br>
organisation, the Branch Davidians.<br>
     History repeated itself when Mr Roden died in 1978. His wife,<br>
Lois, took over the leadership of the group, which split again in<br>
1984.<br>
     Mr Vernon Howell, who now goes by the name David Koresh, took<br>
most of the members with him and has led the cult since then.<br>
     It is now estimated at 75 members male and female.<br>
     Former members of the cult told the Tribune-Herald that Mr<br>
Koresh abused both adult and child members of the cult and claimed<br>
at least 15 wives.<br>
     Meanwhile, the Seventh-day Adventist church denied strongly<br>
any connection with Mr Koresh's group and deplored what happened<br>
near Waco. - Reuter,UPI,NYT.<br>
<p>
CULT LEADER SAYS HE IS THE LAMB IN THE BIBLE<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
WACO (Texas) - Vernon Howell, leader of the Branch Davidian cult,<br>
believes he is the lamb referred to in the Bible's Book of<br>
Revelation, according to the Waco Herald-Tribune.<br>
     Howell, now known as David Koresh, and his followers say he<br>
alone can open the so-called seven seals, setting loose events<br>
which they believe will end mankind and propel Koresh and his<br>
followers into heaven.<br>
     Koresh, 33, told the newspaper over the weekend in a copyright<br>
series: "If the Bible is true, then I'm Christ."<br>
     He also believes in free love.<br>
     The firefight on Sunday was the second at the farm. Koresh and<br>
seven other cult members were accused of attempted murder after a<br>
1987 gun battle with a former leader.<br>
     The seven followers were acquitted, and charges against Koresh<br>
were dismissed after his trial ended with a mistrial. - UPI,NYT.<br>
<p>
--------------------------End of article---------------------------<br>
<p>
Well, the GC comms department did well in getting the disclaimer<br>
into the press so fast. The thing that puzzels me is why it took 2<br>
days for the news to be printed here. I also wonder why they give<br>
so much space in the papers, to an event which, nowadays, is<br>
relatively insignificant(to us here in Singapore) compared to other<br>
happenings in the wider world. Anyway, it still isn't a good thing<br>
for the SDA church.<br>
     I am quite sure that some people will come and ask me about it<br>
and i will have to explain to them that SDAs don't even use guns in<br>
the army. And i wouldn't be surprised if our church is going to be<br>
put under surveillance by agents of the authorities.<br>
     A lot of people, especially other Christians, think we are a<br>
"cult" and this prejudice will not be lessened even though it was<br>
a splinter of a split off from the SDA church which behaved like<br>
that. I think it is quite unfair to think bad of SDAs just because<br>
of the Lindy Chamberlain case (which itself reeks of religious<br>
prejudice) or because of some wacky terrorist splinter group, and<br>
take little notice of the organised terrorist tactics of the IRA and<br>
other so-called Christian groups, for instance.<br>
     Speaking of prejudice, i think it is largely based on<br>
ignorance, because our church is so little-known. The obscure<br>
Branch Davidians have got more published about them, their origins<br>
and so on, in today's papers than the SDA church has had as far<br>
back as i can remember.<br>

Interesting post on Romans 6.  My only question is how does this view of<br>
being under the law correlate with the point I brought up earlier about<br>
the apparent equivalence of under the law and serving sin? <br>

Without permission.  A few more details than Beng's post from Singapore<br>
(wow! coverage way out there)<br>
<p>
WACO, Texas -- The roots of the Branch Davidians date to 1934, when a<br>
disgruntled Seventh-day Adventist split with the church over interpretation<br>
of biblical teachings.  Dissidence and even violence have continued in the<br>
group over the years.<br>
   Members of the sect were involved Sunday [..nothing new..]<br>
   Koresh, who claims to be the Christ, has led the sect since the mid 80's.<br>
   The sect began when Victor Houteff, a Bulgarian immigrant who joined the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist church in 1918, split from church leaders when they<br>
accused him of disrupting an Adventist Sabbath school with his dissident<br>
views.  The sect moved from Los Angeles to Waco in 1935, the year after it<br>
began.<br>
   The Seventh-day Adventist church, which lists worldwide membership of<br>
more than 5 million, has renounced the offshoot and Koresh, who changed his<br>
name from Vernon Howell.  ["renounced" is probably not the right word here<br>
since that suggests a one-time affiliation (??) - fgc]<br>
   Baylor University religion Professor Bill Pitts, who has written several<br>
papers on the Branch Davidians, said Houteff's theological views, especially<br>
his interpretation of the book of Revelation, did not fit the views of the<br>
Seventh-day Adventists.<br>
   Several people followed Houteff when he left the church, Pitts wrote.<br>
   In 1942, Houteff changed the group's name [evidently it had some name<br>
before - fgc] to Davidian Seventh-day Adventists because he believed the<br>
restoration of David's kingdom in Palestine was imminent, Pitts said.<br>
   When Houteff died in 1955, his wife, Florence,, assumed power.  She came<br>
out with her own religious predictions, saying that the new kingdom would come<br>
April 22, 1959.<br>
   Hundreds of followers joined the group, disposing of their property and<br>
businesses.  It was estimated to have 1,400 members during this period.  But<br>
the April 1959 deadline came and passed, and the Davidians splintered, with<br>
most members going with a rival prophet, Ben Roden, who called his group the<br>
Branch Davidians.<br>
   When Roden died in 1978, his wife, Lois, took over leadership.  She led<br>
the Davidians until another split in 1984, when members were torn between<br>
Lois Roden's son, George, and Koresh, who later took most of the members<br>
with him.<br>
   Continued rivalry between the two men lead to violence, including a 1987<br>
gunbattle at the group's compound that led to attempted-murder charges<br>
against Koresh and seven others.<br>
   The seven were acquitted, and a mistrial declared in the case of Koresh.<br>
Charges against him later were dismissed.<br>
   In 1989, George Roden was charged with the murder of a 56-year-old<br>
Odessa, Texas, man.  The following year, he was innocent by reason of insanity.<br>

I have been reading this discussion of the seminary with some interest. <br>
It must be noted that although most go to the seminary for their MDiv,<br>
some do go there for other degrees in upper level theological studies. <br>
Last year I was sturggling with the notion of what I was going to do after<br>
I graduated from Iowa.  Should I go to beSeminary for an MDiv.  I<br>
realizied that that was not for me.  Instead I have felt called to go to<br>
seminary to get an M.A. in Religion.  I guess my point is that not all<br>
those going to Seminary and "called" as such maybe be there for a<br>
minsterial degree. <br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
	Guess what ? I agree with both of you two here on this point<br>
as well. One dimension to this problem however is that on many occasions<br>
the leadership discourages any form of activity on the part of lay members<br>
that is not directed by themselves personally. Some seem to think that<br>
their authority is being undermined when any work is done without <br>
their explicit direction.<br>

[Steve, if you see more than one of these, no problem skipping mine.]<br>
<p>
March 2, 1993, Arizona Republic quotes AP's Scott Rothschild on the<br>
continuing stand-off near Waco, front-page continuing on second.<br>
Final 3 paragraphs in the article:<br>
<p>
    At 18, Koresh, who changed his name from Vernon Howell, joined<br>
    the Seventh-day Adventists in Tyler and was expelled two years later.<br>
<p>
    "We are not surprised at what happened in Waco," said Lynn Ray,<br>
    a church elder.<br>
<p>
    Cyril Miller, president of the church's Southwestern Union<br>
    Theological Center in Burleson, said, "He was a kook, a genuine<br>
    religious fanatic that [sic] was almost totally irrational."<br>
<p>
Anyone know who Lynn Ray is?  A SDA local church elder in Tyler?  Elsewhere?<br>
An elder in the Davidians or Branch Davidians?  By "church elder" did the<br>
writer perhaps mean an SDA leader in denominational employ?<br>
<p>
I don't recognize the name Cyril Miller nor a Southwestern Union<br>
Theological Center nor anything SDA in Burleson.  Is this an erroneous<br>
reference to Southwestern Adventist College in Keene?<br>

<i>&gt;     Cyril Miller, president of the church's Southwestern Union</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Theological Center in Burleson, said, "He was a kook, a genuine</i><br>
<i>&gt;     religious fanatic that [sic] was almost totally irrational."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't recognize the name Cyril Miller nor a Southwestern Union</i><br>
<i>&gt; Theological Center nor anything SDA in Burleson.  Is this an erroneous</i><br>
<i>&gt; reference to Southwestern Adventist College in Keene?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Cyril Miller is president of the Southwestern Union Conference of<br>
Seventh-day Adventists.  He either is or has been on the board of<br>
Andrews University, the Seminary Executive committee.  He used to be<br>
president of the Texas Conference of SDA.<br>

This is a copy of the news GC news release as is being distributed at<br>
Andrews University to the faculty and staff.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The following is a news release from the General Conference concerning the</i><br>
<i>&gt; incident in Waco, Texas:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Waco, Texas, Group Has No Connection with Seventh-day Adventist Church</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      SILVER SPRING, MD--"Branch Davidians" in the news today have no </i><br>
<i>&gt; connection with the Seventh-day Adventist Church.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Several Splinter groups away from Victor Houteff who was disfellowshipped</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the Seventh-day Adventist Church and its ministry at Los Angeles in 1929.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Vernon Howell assumed leadership of the current Waco group in 1988 after being</i><br>
<i>&gt; acquitted following a shoot-out with George Roden.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      The 1988 gun battle was in dispute of the Mount Carmel property near Waco,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Texas, which George said was his, following the death of his father Ben in 1978.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Through the years, the group--which has changed leaders and membership as</i><br>
<i>&gt; further splinters were developed--have called themselves The Shepherd's Rod,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Davidian Seventh-day Adventists, Branch Davidians, and The Davidians.  Not</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of them is know to hold membership in a Seventh-day Adventist Church at</i><br>
<i>&gt; Waco or any other place.  Howell was disfellowshipped from the Tyler, Texas,</i><br>
<i>&gt; congregation in 1981.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Leaders of the various groups have included Victor Houteff's widow</i><br>
<i>&gt; Florence, Ben roden, Lois Roden, George Roden, and Vernon Howell.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Seventh-day Adventist total more than seven million in 206 countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; worldwide.  They promote the sanctity of the family, practice allegiance to</i><br>
<i>&gt; government, observe the seventh-day (Saturday) Sabbath, believe in a second</i><br>
<i>&gt; advent of Christ, follow a non-violent lifestyle, and acknowledge Christ as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Judge of the universe.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;      While North American membership exceeds 783,000, about nine of every</i><br>
<i>&gt; ten Adventists live in other nations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

Cyril Miller really is a good standing SDA leader, and there are<br>
SDA school and church in Burleson.  Whether it houses the offices<br>
I'm not sure.  They're very close if not.  Haven't heard of Lynn,<br>
but then, I haven't lived in Burleson for several years.  It's<br>
about 20-30 miles from Keene.<br>

Prior to General Conference in Indianapolis, the SDA General Conference<br>
Communications team carried out a successful publicity campaign  to<br>
prepare a city not acquainted with SDAs for the major onslaught of SDAs<br>
from around the globe.<br>
<p>
As I recall, they ran a series of announcements/ads on local television,<br>
professionally produced, about who SDAs are, why they are coming to the city,<br>
when they are coming, etc. They met with print press officials and supplied<br>
information about eh organization and created a laison. When GC happened, I<br>
followed the press coverage carefully. There were articles on everything from<br>
SDAs from the Soviet Union, Pitcarin (and stamps from there), fruit stands<br>
running out of fruits and vegetables, vegetarianism, the technoguts of<br>
feeding thousands of vegetarian meals in just a short time, etc. etc.<br>
<p>
Stories (negative) which otherwise could have receive high play didn't.<br>
For example, there were groups demonstrating there from other organizations<br>
such as the Indiana Athiests, etc. etc. Now, most people in Indianapolis<br>
who attend to the media probably know who SDAs are. The church owes a<br>
great deal to the quiet, behind-the-scenes operation of the Communication<br>
Dept., which spent money wisely on a tight budget and worked closely with<br>
the media in advance. <br>
<p>
This is an example of good public relations. In many cities across America,<br>
communications secretaries are doing the same thing when a church holds a<br>
stop-smoing clinic, sends relief to Hurricane Andrew victims. etc. The<br>
Knoxville News-Sentinel ran a full-color 8 X 10 photo above the fold on<br>
the front page on the church's relief efforts. Of course, the local news-<br>
paper has also run front-page stories this year on the babies that got<br>
switched in the Adventist hospital at Greenville and the resulting <br>
lawsuit. <br>
<p>
Pam Harris<br>
<p>
[Unfortunately, as I understand it, within a few months after GC<br>
there was a giant brouhaha in the Indianapolis churches, leaving them<br>
unable to capitalize on this good PR.  R. Helzerman is from there<br>
and is a member of SDAnet, he has given some details to SDAnet before <br>
on this situation.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt;Tony writes:</i><br>

<i>&gt;I would like to see some of those who feel called to be leaders</i><br>
<i>&gt;take on that responsibility as best they can in their current state,</i><br>
<i>&gt;whether they're plumbers or professors.  A call to minister</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't equate with a call to the seminary.</i><br>
<p>
	I couldn't agree with you more Tony.  While I do believe that if<br>
	we lift seminary completion to high status, then discriminatory practices<br>
	during or after enrollment, based solely on a persons' skin color, age,<br>
	or gender, strikes me as AntiCHRIST-like.<br>
<p>
	Isn't it interesting that Jesus faced the same thing for not being formally<br>
	educated in the schools of the prophets?  Are we better than our Master?<br>
	Can we expect the human heart, that worships human achievements,<br>
	fame, to treat the children better than our Lord was treated?<br>

Lynn Ray, quoted in versions of the Keresh story as being from Tyler,<br>
Texas, was an active member when I lived there in the mid-1980s. He is<br>
a successful businessman with no ties whatsoever to the Davidians, but a<br>
regular member of the Tyler SDA Church. <br>
<p>
Does anyone know if Shirley Burton (Communications Director for the SDA<br>
Church) has an e-mail address?<br>

FYI  The M.A. in Religion is an academic degree.  It may be taken in one<br>
year if the candidate has a B.A. Theology.  Otherwise it takes 2 years.<br>
Its main purpose is to prepare candidates for entrance into Ph.D.<br>
programs.  The degree is offered in NT, OT, Theology, and Mission.<br>
It is not ministerial preparation, since there are no practics.<br>
The M.Div. program is designed to train pastors who are facing a most<br>
demanding calling and profession--being all things to all people, and<br>
above all, responsible to God.  It takes 27 months and includes <br>
practical responsibilities in a church, as well as theoretical courses<br>
in pastoring.<br>

I believe it was Raylene who mentioned that she knew someone who had<br>
joined that group.  I was reading the New Times yesterday, and it noted<br>
that Koresh made to recruiting tours in California and Australia.  Maybe<br>
the friend joined through one of these. <br>

Last night on the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour, a Professor at UC Santa<br>
Barbara who is an expert on cults was interviewed concerning the origin<br>
of the Branch Davidians and specifically concerning their relationship<br>
to the SDA Church. He said that in 1942 a group of SDA's objected<br>
to the Church's relaxing of their pacifist stand toward WWII. This <br>
group felt that the Church should hold a stronger pacifist stand (I assume<br>
tis relates to participation in the military.). They then broke off<br>
from the Church and formed the Branch Davidians. This is the first<br>
that I've heards this story. Does anyone know if this is true?<br>

What ever the case, the deeper question is how is the church going to<br>
approach damage contorol.  I noticed that on the news this morning, the<br>
reporter went out of his way to "make it completely clear that this group<br>
has nothing to do with the current Seventh-day Adventist church"  It sounds<br>
like damage control is engaged, and working.  One of my co-workers (a very<br>
good friend), who is very aquainted with the SDA church, having gone through<br>
a Revelation Seminar, and known a SDA pastor very well, walked into my cube<br>
and jokingly told me that my phone had been ringing, and he thought about<br>
answering it, and saying that I was up in a compound in Waco, and no one<br>
knew what I was doing.  Later he came by and ribbed me about "my folks<br>
up in Waco".  I happen to know this guy very well, so I took it for what it<br>
was, a bit of joking.  He had taken the time to go to the library sunday<br>
and researched the Branch Davidian's, and gave me a run down on the history.<br>
We had a good visit, but it still was uncomfortable, and I wonder just how<br>
many other incidents, both joking and serious have happened to others.<br>
Cheers<br>

<p>
Yes, we even got news coverage of the Waco shootout out here in Hong<br>
Kong.  Following is a article from the Hong Kong edition of the<br>
International Herald Tribune.<br>
<p>
A SECT PUNCTUATED BY VIOLENCE<br>
By Gustav Niebuhr  (Washington Post Service)<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON--The history of the Branch Davidians, the religious sect<br>
whose members shot it out with federal agents in Waco, Texas, is<br>
marked by end-of-the-world predictions, frequent schisms and a long<br>
war of words with the Seventh-day Adventist Church.<br>
  An internal power struggle led to a gunfight between leaders of the<br>
sect in 1987.<br>
  The Branch Davidians, headquartered in a fortress-like enclave near<br>
Waco, have 2,000 to 3,000 adherents nationwide.  They trace their<br>
history to the visionary prophecies of a charismatic Los Angeles<br>
minister who was kicked out of his own denomination.<br>
  The Bulgarian-born Victor Houteff was defrocked by Seventh-day<br>
Adventist authorities for asserting he had been appointed by God to<br>
"cleanse" the denomination of false believers, according to Shirley<br>
Burton, spokeswoman for the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which is<br>
based in Silver Spring, Maryland.<br>
  Although a number of Branch Davidians are former Seventh-day<br>
Adventists, the sect has been strongly disavowed by that church, which<br>
is well-established in the mainstream of American religion and has 7.6<br>
million adherents worldwide.<br>
  The church was begun in 1863 by some former followers of William<br>
Miller, who had predicted that Jesus Christ would return to Earth in<br>
1844.  Adventists, who can now be found in more than 200 nations and<br>
are known especially for their medical schools and hospitals and<br>
emphasis on health, celebrate a Saturday Sabbath and hold that<br>
Christ's Second Coming will soon occur.  The church, however, does not<br>
believe in setting dates for that event, Mrs. Burton said.<br>
  Throughout much of their history, Branch Davidians have clung to a<br>
distinctive reading of the biblical book of Ezekiel, in particular,<br>
the passage in which an angel is sent to place a mark on the foreheads<br>
of the righteous inhabitants of Jerusalem to spare them slaughter by<br>
invaders.  The sect has believed that the passage applies to the<br>
modern Seventh-day Adventist Church, and that the "destroying angel"<br>
will come among its ranks, separating the few true believers from the<br>
rest, said Bill Shea, a Seventh-day Adventist researcher.<br>
  As a result, the sect, operating with evangelical zeal, has taken<br>
its beliefs directly to local Adventist congregations, passing out<br>
pamphlets in the parking lots and buttonholing the faithful after<br>
services, all the while warning that the denomination's leadership is<br>
corrupt, both he and Mrs. Burton said.<br>
  "They prey in a very parasitic form on Adventist churches and<br>
Adventist members," Mr. Shea said.<br>
  "They feel the modern Adventist church is an apostate," he added.<br>
"So the relationship has been one of ongoing antagonism."<br>
  Shortly after his defrocking, Mr. Houteff established his<br>
headquarters in Waco and named the sect the Shepherd's Rod.  He told<br>
his followers that God would soon set up his true church in Palestine<br>
and that Mr. Houteff would serve there as Christ's lieutenant, Mrs.<br>
Burton said.<br>
  The sect has suffered periods of turmoil since Mr. Houteff's death<br>
in 1955.  At one point, members expected the former leader to be<br>
resurrected, according to news reports and Adventist officials.  In<br>
1959, after Mr. Houteff's widow, Florence, unsuccessfully predicted a<br>
divine slaughter of "wicked" Seventh-day Adventists and the<br>
establishment of God's kingdom among the true believers, leadership<br>
passed to one of the followers, Benjamin Roden, Mrs. Burton said.<br>
  Mr. Roden changed the sect's name to the Branch Davidians and led<br>
the group until his death in 1978, when he was succeeded by his widow,<br>
Lois.  The sect went through several years of trauma starting in 1984<br>
when members split over whether they should be led by the Mr. Roden's<br>
son George, or a new member, Vernon Howell.<br>
  Mr. Howell--who was involved in the shootout Sunday--eventually<br>
established his supremacy, but not without violence.  The rivalry led<br>
to a gun battle in 1987 between Mr. Howell and his supporters and<br>
George Roden, according to news reports.  After the incident, seven of<br>
Mr. Howell's followers were acquitted of attempted murder.  Mr.<br>
Howell's trial ended in a hung jury and the dismissal of the charges.<br>

I only saw one mention of this on the SDANet.  The Frederick Maryland church<br>
burned down last Sunday.  The timing of this event was enough to make the fire<br>
department suspect arson, but on Monday they determined that the fire was<br>
started by a faulty transformer.<br>
<p>
These days is not uncommon for churches to be fire bombed.  There was some<br>
concern that the events in Texas would cause someone to bomb one of our<br>
churches.  There have been some threats.  I don't know if there were any new<br>
threats after the events last Sunday or not.<br>

I Read the other day in the Adventist Commentary that the Shepherd Rod<br>
movement broke up into many splinters after the founders death.<br>
<p>
Would it be fair to say that The "Branch Davidians" are the main branch of<br>
that movement today?<br>

I just read in the newsmagazine "Newsweek", that Pope Pius XII is on the road<br>
to canonization. There is uproar over this because Pius "(who reigned from 1939<br>
to '58) was publicly silent during the Holocaust."  I must confess my <br>
ignorance<br>
on this... what is canonization?<br>
<p>
[Canonization is the process of the Catholic church declaring a person <br>
to be a saint.  SCT]<br>

Well Woody, I also have had comments re this Texas shootout.<br>
<p>
There is one other Christian (besides myself) in the Chemistry Department. He<br>
used to be caught up in a very legalistic offshoot of the Presbyterian(?)<br>
church (as a minister) but left.<br>
<p>
Yesterday he was making comments to the effect that "Well I suppose you must<br>
have had a lot of questions about the Texas shooting?". (And apart from him<br>
I hadn't). I replied to the effect that I hadn't (and why should I have <br>
anyway) and he started with the breakaway from the SDA church story. (I'm<br>
sure this guy things SDA's are really weird). But fortunately I had read<br>
lots of history of the cult in SDAnet so could answer his claims with some<br>
degree of knowledge! <br>
<p>
I almost get the impression that it is the other Christians that think we're<br>
weird more than people without any religion at all - or maybe the others are<br>
just more polite?!<br>

I don't think that a stand with regard to the Holocaust is a criteria<br>
the Catholic church uses to decide whether someone 'deserves' to become<br>
(or be declared) a saint.<br>
<p>
The last cannonization of the founder of the Opus Dei movement (a native<br>
Spanish) is perhaps a clear indication that the church is rapidly<br>
moving towards the 'political right' and abandoning its short-lived<br>
'compromised with the poor'.<br>
<p>
Patricio Navia.<br>
<p>
(the canonization of people has become a more common practice during<br>
the past few years, in October 1992, the Pope while visiting the<br>
Domincan Republic cannonized several latin American bishops, nouns<br>
and laymen.  In fact, and just as a 'trivial note' a Chilean noun<br>
will soon be cannonized in the Vatican and in Chile there are several<br>
travel agencies offering plans to attend the ceremony andtake the<br>
opportunity to travel around Europe).<br>

<i>&gt; to the SDA Church. He said that in 1942 a group of SDA's objected</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the Church's relaxing of their pacifist stand toward WWII. This </i><br>
<i>&gt; group felt that the Church should hold a stronger pacifist stand (I assume</i><br>
<i>&gt; tis relates to participation in the military.). They then broke off</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the Church and formed the Branch Davidians. This is the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I've heards this story. Does anyone know if this is true?</i><br>
<p>
Sounds majorly confused.  The facts that have come to SDAnet so far<br>
show that Houteff et al split off prior to WWII.  I had not understood<br>
that his group was named Shepherd's Rod at one point (I even got<br>
something from them, unsolicited of course 8-), a few months back) before<br>
switching to Davidians.<br>
<p>
As for the pacifist item:  During WWI, Germans SDA young men were being<br>
conscripted into the Kaiser's army.  Given that conscientious objectors were<br>
not given any quarter, an appeal was made to the GC to opine whether SDA<br>
young men should refuse to serve (no option to just not bear arms) or to<br>
serve it whatever capacity they were assigned.  The GC evidently said<br>
it was OK to serve, given the tough situation.  Numerous Germans disagreed<br>
with this "relaxing of the pacifist stand" and felt that the church<br>
should hold "a stronger pacifist stand".  This group split off to become<br>
the Reformed Seventh-day Adventist Church in protest over the compromise.<br>
I have no idea what their attitudes and positions are at this time.<br>
<p>
The background for my info is this:  In 1987, a family moved to this<br>
area and started attending our church.  They were members of the Reformed<br>
SDA church.  During an elders meeting, the pastor discussed with us re<br>
how to handle the application for membership in our church.  We moved<br>
to Oregon before they were brought into membership, so I don't know the<br>
rest of the details, but I distinctly recall our pastor, Bill Bassham,<br>
preaching a sermon on the fallout that results from compromise, in which<br>
he specifically touched on the events surrounding the split off of the<br>
Reformed SDA church.<br>

Any users of the EGW CD-ROM?  Whatzit cost?  Is it worth it or would you,<br>
to someone contemplating its purchase, recommend sticking with the 3<br>
volume index?  How well done is the search &amp; display software?  How would<br>
it compare to Bible search &amp; display software such as QuickVerse,<br>
PC Study Bible, or OnLine Bible, in terms of interface, ease-of-use?<br>
<p>
Finally, any CD-ROM drives to recommend or avoid?  DAK claims to have<br>
good ones for relatively low $$.  Thx.<br>

A coworker of mine, made it a point to stop by my office yesterday.<br>
He's from a Catholic (dad)/Jewish (mom) home, and is disillusioned<br>
about religion in general.  We had a good visit, and he shared some<br>
jokes about "Kooks" in religion, making a special point to say that<br>
he didn't believe the SDA church was "Kookie".  Then we fell into a<br>
discussion about the lack of coverage (in comparison) over the World<br>
Trade Center bombing.  Ultimately concluding that all these "Davidian"<br>
ethnic cleansing, legalizing mistreatment of other people, are but<br>
*symptoms* of the diseases of pride, greed, and self-exaltation = hearts<br>
without the testimony, and passion for JESUS and his love.<br>

It's been interesting to read the conversation on the Unix nets<br>
about the shootout in Waco.  Most of it is actually supportive<br>
of the Branch Davidians, asking what business did the government have<br>
going in shooting, especially since they had no proof that any illegal<br>
weapons were at the compound.  Koresh evidently has a license to own most <br>
if not all of the weapons he does.  <br>
<p>
Others have focused on the religious liberty issues this raises,<br>
wondering who will be next with such a raid.<br>
<p>
Marcus Stringer asks, why is our church so little known?  I think it <br>
is because our church has developed an inferiority complex about being <br>
different from the world, while at the same time we have assimilated to it.<br>
If our churches were all places where people could know the love <br>
of Jesus Christ  (some are now, but not enough), we wouldn't have to do <br>
PR or have parades or bake sales or whatever.  People would be breaking <br>
down the doors.  (For that matter, if we could hold half of the visitors<br>
we already get, our churches would soon be too small.)  <br>

Hello fellow netters.  I have never posted anything on the net, but I sit back<br>
and listen to a lot.  I'm currently a student at the University of Maryland<br>
seeking a degree in computer science.  I'm a baby SDA for I joined the church<br>
about 4 years ago. <br>
<p>
Actually, I'm making this post for a friend of mine, Richard Kajiura, who <br>
works at the Communications Department for the General Conference under the<br>
supervision of Shirley Burton.  He was wanting some responses to the following<br>
question.<br>
<p>
  We were all created in God's image, what does this mean to you?<br>
<p>
The answer should be in 60 words or less.  Approximately 5 responses will be<br>
chosen to be put into the NAD Adventist Review which is the monthly issue<br>
which goes to most North American Adventist homes.  He needs the responses by<br>
March 10.  If your article is chosen, the Review will be wanting a picture<br>
of you to be printed along with your response.  This is actually an experi-<br>
mental posting, for the Communications Department is considering subscribing<br>
to CompuServe for further posts of this nature.  Your responses are valuable<br>
so the Review staff can see the value of Internet mail and it's uses.  You<br>
should also include your full name and telephone number with area code so<br>
the Review staff can contact you if you are picked.  Because of this, you<br>
may want to mail your responses directly to me.  <br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
 Tony L. Donley<br>

Actually, Cyril Miller was the Texas conference president for a while, then<br>
moved up to union president.  I think that the reference given, is perhaps<br>
the union headquarters.  The Texas confrence headquarters is in Avarado,<br>
not very far away.<br>

[From Ron Vyhmeister]<br>
Following is the text of a copyrighted article on the situation of the<br>
Battle Creek Adventist Hospital.  It seems a real possibility that we<br>
may lose this historical institution.  I'm curious about people's<br>
feelings on the subject.  Taken from Battle Creek Enquirer, Feb. 6.<br>
<p>
<p>
Ailing Adventist Hospital exploring link with BCHS<br>
By Mark Mayes<br>
<p>
Rocked by millions of dollars in losses the last two years, Battle Creek<br>
Adventist Hospital is looking for help.<br>
<p>
The hospital's president, Ronald Brown, has approached Battle Creek<br>
Health System (Sisters of Mercy) officials about combining efforts to<br>
keep local psychiatric services going.<br>
<p>
"Over the last couple of years, the hospital has not operated<br>
profitably," Brown said, "The hospital doesn't really have a financial<br>
safety net as some organizations do."<br>
<p>
A logical place to turn was BCHS, the area's largest health-care<br>
provider, Brown said.<br>
<p>
BCHS has never been in the psychiatry business but got involved to<br>
make sure psychiatric services are available in Battle Creek, BCHS<br>
President Stephen Abbott said.<br>
<p>
"We're concerned about maintaining psychiatric services in this<br>
community," Abbott said, "How that is done could take many forms."<br>
<p>
Before talks between the hospitals began, Adventist tried to deal with<br>
its financial crisis from within, making major restructuring changes<br>
and cutting workers from about 320 to 210 since the end of 1991. More<br>
layoffs are possible.<br>
<p>
Officials from Adventist and BCHS have been talking for two months.<br>
But decisions on whether the organizations will merge are up in the<br>
air, Brown said.<br>
<p>
Brown said Adventist Hospital, is not for sale and a decision has<br>
not been made about the building's future.<br>
<p>
"We're looking to find the best way to integrate some of our programs<br>
or services into their delivery system," Brown said, "We really don't<br>
have all the answers because we really don't know what all the options<br>
are at this point."<br>
<p>
But a decision will have to be made soon, Brown said.<br>
<p>
"We're talking months, not years, at this point," he said.<br>
<p>
The major problem for Adventist Hospital, the largest regional<br>
mental health and addicion-treatment center in Southwest Michigan,<br>
is a loss of patinets.<br>
<p>
The hospital is providing more treatment on an outpatient basis than<br>
ever before and patients are not staying in the hospital as long as<br>
they used to.<br>
<p>
The length of the average hospital stay was down neraly 50 percent<br>
last year alone.  Adventist hospital uses about half of its 155 beds<br>
on a regular basis, Brown said.<br>
<p>
In recent years, the hospital began to branch out from its traditional<br>
role of providing inpatient care.<br>
<p>
In 1991, while celebrating its 125th anniversary, the hospital built a<br>
rehabilitation center and gymnasium to provide facilities for<br>
occupational therapy.<br>
<p>
It also began an organized effort to expand its outpatient programs.<br>
It moved the New Day Center Addiction and Treatment Passages and<br>
psychological services from the hospital to 333 E. Columbia Ave.<br>
<p>
Abbott said some of the facilities at the Adventist Hosptial would<br>
be critical to providing psychiatric care.<br>
<p>
"But we, as hospitals, don't need all the space that we used to,"<br>
he said.<br>
<p>
Combining the efforts of BSHS and Adventist follow a health-care trend<br>
forced by rising health-care costs and pressure from business and<br>
insurance companies.<br>
<p>
"Twelve years ago, Battle Creek was a four-hospital town," Brown said.<br>
"Essentially, with the way health care has moved, Battle Creek is the<br>
size town that needs one integrated health-care delivery system.<br>
<p>
"And I think that's the way it's coming together."<br>
<p>
--------------------------<br>
This has been updated to mean that the hospital is either merging or<br>
closing. Either way, the Battle Creek Adventist Hospital will cease<br>
to exist. Any comments, what do you think?<br>
<p>
[It wouldn't be the first time the church has lost Battle Creek<br>
Adventist Hospital (formerly Sanitarium).  It was out of denominational<br>
hands from 1907 through the late 1960's.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt;It's been interesting to read the conversation on the Unix nets</i><br>

<i>&gt;going in shooting, especially since they had no proof that any illegal</i><br>

<i>&gt;if not all of the weapons he does.</i><br>
<p>
Well, the newspaper said that an ATF agent was hit by a round from a<br>
50-calibre machine gun. I may be wrong, but I doubt you can get a licence<br>
for that, even in Texas.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Others have focused on the religious liberty issues this raises,</i><br>
<i>&gt;wondering who will be next with such a raid.</i><br>
<p>
Well, it appears to me, that they got raided not because of their religion,<br>
but because they broke the law. This of course, raises the question of<br>
where to draw the line between religious liberty and the law of the land.<br>
Should religious liberty include being allowed to own an arsenal of<br>
dangerous weapons and using them to shoot at people?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Marcus Stringer asks, why is our church so little known?  I think it </i><br>
<i>&gt;is because our church has developed an inferiority complex about being </i><br>
<i>&gt;different from the world, while at the same time we have assimilated to it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;If our churches were all places where people could know the love </i><br>
<i>&gt;of Jesus Christ  (some are now, but not enough), we wouldn't have to do </i><br>
<i>&gt;PR or have parades or bake sales or whatever.  People would be breaking </i><br>
<i>&gt;down the doors.  (For that matter, if we could hold half of the visitors</i><br>
<i>&gt;we already get, our churches would soon be too small.)  </i><br>
<p>
Actually, that is very true. If we have not the love of Jesus, then we<br>
are nothing. All our truths and so on are good and necessary, but without<br>
love, it'll all amount to nothing. Our job, first and foremost, is to<br>
show people what God is like, to lift Christ up before mankind, that He<br>
may draw all men to himself, and to help them get to know Jesus personally.<br>
If the world only knew the love of God, i'm sure most of them would be<br>
attracted by it. Once a person really knows Christ, is really convicted<br>
and converted, i'm sure God will be able to lead them to His true church.<br>
	Having said that, i think PR is still necessary for the church,<br>
to let people know more about what the church stands for and of its<br>
character and activities, because there are still a lot of people who<br>
don't know very much about SDAs and they hear all sorts of funny ideas<br>
about us and this might make them harder for us to reach later on. And<br>
PR is not only about dispelling prejudice, it is about letting people<br>
know about the gospel we have and about the love of God.<br>

Yes I am back from holiday in GOA, India.<br>
<p>
In GOA there is two Adventist schools, one in Panjim and an other in Vasco da Gama<br>
We wewre at sabbathschol in the school in Vasco; SDA Busy Bee High School. <br>
Interesting to note is that as SDA is supporting the school with some 300<br>
students, only the principal and one teacher are adventists, the other are <br>
local people without SDA background (60% of population are Catholics, since<br>
Goa is an former protuguese colony). The school cannot afford to pay the salaries<br>
SDA teachers require. I am thinking about the question why have and support with<br>
missionary money that kind of work.<br>

A coworker of mine, made it a point to stop by my office yesterday.<br>
He's from a Catholic (dad)/Jewish (mom) home, and is disillusioned<br>
about religion in general.  We had a good visit, and he shared some<br>
jokes about "Kooks" in religion, making a special point to say that<br>
he didn't believe the SDA church was "Kookie".  Then we fell into a<br>
discussion about the lack of coverage (in comparison) over the World<br>
Trade Center bombing.  Ultimately concluding that all these "Davidian"<br>
ethnic cleansing, legalizing mistreatment of other people, are but<br>
*symptoms* of the diseases of pride, greed, and self-exaltation = hearts<br>
without the testimony, and passion for JESUS and his love.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
That lack of coverage is apparent here too, in fact, the Waco shootout<br>
has eclipsed almost every other foreign news story of its type, even<br>
the events in the Balkans or Somalia. There's something in the papers<br>
*every* day about the Waco incident. Yesterday there was more than 1 page<br>
of articles abouut the Brach Davidians and also other "cults", and the<br>
SDA church was mentioned more than i like, although they didn't call us a<br>
cult. It seems that stories of cults interest the public a lot.<br>
	Well, as for that bit about it being symptoms of a godless heart,<br>
its quite true, in fact you only have to look around and watch people to<br>
see all that stuff. There is so much selfishness, ruthlessness and hostility<br>
and distrust in this world, its rotten to the core, thats why we have a song<br>
called "This world is not my home" because we can't feel at home here.<br>
	Education and legislation, culture and society, these all have their<br>
sphere of influence and use, but when it comes to transforming the heart,<br>
changing the character, implanting right motives, morality and altruism,<br>
these are all of little effect and God is THE ONLY answer.<br>
	Well, like your friend, its easy to get disillusioned with religion,<br>
because most of it is indistinguishable from the darkness of this blighted<br>
world, but all who seek the truth honestly shall find it.<br>

Thanks Dave for your thoughtful comments about the law.  I am not capable of<br>
reading the Greek in context and appreciate your  interpretation.  Your post<br>
raises some thoughts in my mind.<br>
<p>
You suggest that we can use this interpretation of the law (nomos) to split<br>
out a core of the law that is divine and leave behind the baggage of human<br>
tradition.  The divine component of the Law is to be followed whereas the<br>
human tradition is of no value.  The grace of Christ is the source of<br>
salvation however.<br>
<p>
I would like to suggest a more radical interpretation.  Paul seems to suggest<br>
in Romans 6 that the Law (nomos, however it may be interpreted) is not<br>
relevant to my salvation.  My salvation is "in Christ".  Jesus Christ saves<br>
me because of his freely offered grace which is given to me if I accept it. <br>
The Law is now obsolete because Christ paid whatever penalty the Law was to<br>
exact.  It's main purpose now is as a schoolmaster to point me to Christ.  <br>
My keeping of the law, while a necessary component of behavior for a follower<br>
of Christ, is not the source of my salvation.  Put another way, even if a<br>
human could live his/her own life completely free from transgressing the law<br>
eternal life would not be obtained.  Just think about it; we Adventists do<br>
not believe in an immortal soul, we believe that death is the end of us until<br>
God calls us back to life.  A perfect life, lived without sin is still<br>
subject to death (for example, Christ).  Once we are dead only an act of God<br>
can recreate us, so regardless of perfect adherence to the law we still are<br>
saved by GRACE.<br>
<p>
This leaves us with what I like to think of as the "Boarding Academy<br>
problem", that being " How are we going to get Christians to follow the rules<br>
if they are no longer required to?"  To solve this problem we need to<br>
reconsider what Grace is and what it's action is on the person who accepts<br>
it.  Accepting God's Grace is not a glib trite experience but rather is a<br>
life changing event that reorients the whole direction of ones life.  When I<br>
realized the enormous meaning of Christ's sacrifice, and what risks He took,<br>
and what love He demonstrated I was awestruck.   Gone were trivia such as<br>
whether it is o.k. to go out to eat on Sabbath and in its place was a desire<br>
to know who Christ really is and to be like Him.  Don't misunderstand me,<br>
behaving like Christ is a constant challenge, but the focus is on Christ,<br>
rather than the law.<br>
<p>
These posts never seem to be short!!!  I am curious what the rest of you<br>
think regarding all of this.<br>
<p>
Thanks for reading,<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
The news regarding Battle Creek Adventist Hospital (BCAH) is not surprising.<br>
My mother has worked there for about 20 years.  I worked there during academy.<br>
Mom recently was forced to retire due job cuts there in January.  She is not <br>
in any way bitter toward BCAH.  It was a good place to work.  I rather enjoyed <br>
it there myself, although I wouldn't want to scrub pots and pans for a living<br>
the rest of my days. :)<br>
<p>
It really is a shame to see the Hospital's fortunes wane.  It continues to <br>
provide a necessary service to southwestern Michigan.  Unfortunately, while<br>
the services may be needed, the money is not available to pay for them.  <br>
<p>
I have not worked there for quite some time, so am not qualified to comment<br>
on the current spiritual climate of the care given there.  The question needs<br>
to raised (and is almost certainly being discussed by BCAH administrators):<br>
Can BCAH fulfill its mission if not owned or controlled by SDA's?<br>
<p>
This would be a good time to examine on the net just what we mean by <br>
"distinctive Adventist health care."  I need to look into this myself.  The <br>
latest Adventist Review (March 4, NAD edition) caries an article by Robert <br>
Folkenberg regarding Adventist health care.  This is a good place to start.<br>
<p>
I have a lot of good memories from Battle Creek.  They are in a significant<br>
way related to the many people employed there over the years, not to mention<br>
the other institutions in the area which, in part, serve the families of those<br>
employees.  Battle Creek Academy will suffer if BCAH closes.<br>
<p>
Maybe my brother Ron, who is also a Battle Creek Academy alumnus, can add to<br>
the discussion.<br>

Hello all,<br>
<p>
I am interested in setting up an anonymous ftp site for the EGW CD-ROM.  I was<br>
surprized to find out that the EGW estate has copyrights on all of that stuff,<br>
and I might just get in trouble for doing that!?  Anyone know anything about<br>
this statement?  Seems to me that we'd want to just plain give all of this<br>
away like we do with Desire of Ages.  Perhaps there's some sensative material<br>
on the disk, I don't know.<br>
<p>
thanks,<br>
<p>
dan<br>
<p>
P.S. Anyone going to the Amazing Facts Lay Evangelism Seminar in June?<br>

<i>&gt; Well, it appears to me, that they got raided not because of their religion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but because they broke the law. This of course, raises the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt; where to draw the line between religious liberty and the law of the land.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Should religious liberty include being allowed to own an arsenal of</i><br>
<i>&gt; dangerous weapons and using them to shoot at people?</i><br>
<p>
Weapons, dangerous or not, are not bad in and of themselves.  It's the people<br>
who use them and how they use them that can be bad.<br>
<p>
Why shouldn't religious liberty be extended to those with guns?  As long as<br>
no illegal activity is performed with them, and as long as no laws of the land<br>
are broken, then they should be entitled to the freedom of religion.  Our<br>
constitution guarantees it.<br>
<p>
Just because someone has dangerous weapons in their posession is no offense.<br>
It is possible to get licenses for fully automatic weapons (at least it used to<br>
be possible a few years ago).  I don't know if this includes 50-cal machine guns<br>
or not.<br>
<p>
As for using them for shooting at people, I would say that Koresh and company were <br>
shooting out of self defense.  They were not shooting at innocent people.  The <br>
laws of this land do allow shooting people out of self defense if the persons <br>
attacking you are doing so illegally...such as someone trying to murder or rape <br>
you, etc.  I don't believe this applies in Koresh's situation since he was firing<br>
on law enforcement officers (although he obviously would have a different opinion <br>
on this).<br>
<p>
I am not condoning Koresh's actions in any way, simply trying to address the comment <br>
that just because you own/possess dangerous weapons and/or shoot at people means <br>
you should have your religious liberty deprived.<br>

<i>&gt;eh?"  Writes...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any users of the EGW CD-ROM?  Whatzit cost?  Is it worth it or would you,</i><br>
<i>&gt;to someone contemplating its purchase, recommend sticking with the 3</i><br>
<i>&gt;volume index?  How well done is the search &amp; display software?  How would</i><br>
<i>&gt;it compare to Bible search &amp; display software such as QuickVerse,</i><br>
<i>&gt;PC Study Bible, or OnLine Bible, in terms of interface, ease-of-use?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Finally, any CD-ROM drives to recommend or avoid?  DAK claims to have</i><br>
<i>&gt;good ones for relatively low $$.  Thx.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I recently purchased the EGW CD-ROM.  I paid around $425, but I had a $50<br>
discount that was on a back page of the Review about 4-5 months ago.  I<br>
believe the discount was available through March of this year so look for<br>
it.  I think the search feature works well and is reasonably fast.  I<br>
prefer the Windows program to the DOS program.  My system is a 386/40,<br>
Diamond Stealth Video Card (this improved screen speed), NEC-25 CD-ROM<br>
drive (it was packaged with a sound card and speakers, Media Vision's<br>
Fusion CD product).  I've seen the DAK inexpensive CD product and it is<br>
probably comparable.  I was concerned about the EGW CD-ROM and CD-ROM drive<br>
compatibility, but the latest drives appear to have settled on current<br>
drive standards so have no problems.  I've purchased a variety of CD-ROM's<br>
since with no compatibility problems.<br>
<p>
I'm very happy with the CD-ROM.  Not being a bookworm, having the<br>
computer do the searching form me has helped tremendously.  As I said I<br>
prefer the Windows search program.  It's good, but parts of the<br>
program could be better.  BTW, by getting the CD-ROM now, you are suppose<br>
to get the next upgrade free.<br>

I agreed with much of what Ron Swensen had to say in his comments about<br>
God's Torah vs Jewish Torah, in his response to my post.<br>
<p>
It is too bad that so many people seem to think that if something is<br>
not a means of salvation, then its not worth bothering with.  Frankly,<br>
I call this legalism, the other side of the coin of legalism -- some<br>
people are legalists because they think works will save them.  Others<br>
are legalists in that they don't do things because its not a work of<br>
salvation -- if it won't save me, why bother.<br>
<p>
A text that EGW quoted from time to time:<br>
<p>
   "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.  <br>
   He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, <br>
   and the truth is not in him."  (1 John 2:3,4)<br>
<p>
Frankly, there is an abundance of texts that should make it clear that<br>
the God's Torah was not done away with at the cross:<br>
<p>
First some from the OT:<br>
<p>
   "And now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you but to fear <br>
   the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the <br>
   Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to observe <br>
   the Lord's commandments and statutes that I am giving you today for your <br>
   own good?"  (Deut. 10:12,13)<br>
<p>
   All his commandments are sure . . . . They stand fast for ever and ever.  <br>
   (Ps. 111:7,8)<br>
<p>
   "There is a way which seems right unto a man, but in the end it leeds to <br>
   death."  (Prov. 14:12; 16:25)<br>
<p>
   "If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law, even his prayers are <br>
   detestable."  (Prov. 28:9)<br>
<p>
   Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.  <br>
   For God will judge every deed including every hidden thing.  (Eccl. <br>
   12:13,14)<br>
<p>
Consider this next text.  If Paul does indeed do away with God's law,<br>
then Paul is unfit to be a prophet or evangelist or book writer of the<br>
New Testament.  He is not a man of God.  But Paul does not do away with<br>
God's law.  Paul does uphold God's law.  He simply does away with the<br>
notion that law keeping = salvation.<br>
<p>
   "To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this <br>
   word, it is because there is no light in them."  --  Isa 8:20  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
Back to OT texts:<br>
<p>
   "The earth is also defiled under its inhabitants, because they have <br>
   transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, Broken the everlasting <br>
   covenant."  --  Isa 24:5  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our <br>
   king; it is he who will save us."  (Isa. 33:22)<br>
<p>
   " . . . . He will magnify the law, and make it honorable." (Isa. 42:21)<br>
<p>
   "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove <br>
   from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.  And I will <br>
   put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to <br>
   keep my laws."  (Ez. 36:26,27)<br>
<p>
   "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected <br>
   knowledge, I also will reject you from being priest for Me; Because you <br>
   have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children."  -<br>
   -  Hosea 4:6  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
New Testament:<br>
<p>
   "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I <br>
   have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.  I tell you the <br>
   truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not <br>
   the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law <br>
   until everything is accomplished. Anyone who breaks one of the least of <br>
   these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called <br>
   least in the kingdom of heaven,  but whoever practices and teaches these <br>
   commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  For I tell you <br>
   that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the <br>
   teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of <br>
   heaven."  (Matt. 5:17-20) (See Luke 16:17) (See Isa. 42:21)<br>
<p>
   Not every one who says Lord Lord will enter into the kingdom of heaven; <br>
   but he that doeth the will of my Father.  (Matt. 7:21-23) (Also Luke <br>
   6:46) (Also Rom. 2:13)<br>
<p>
   "And it happened, as He spoke these things, that a certain woman from the <br>
   crowd raised her voice and said to Him, "Blessed is the womb that bore <br>
   You, and the breasts which nursed You!"  But He said, "More than that, <br>
   blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!""  --  Luke <br>
   11:27,28  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "I know that his commanments lead to everlasting life.  Whatever I say <br>
   is what the Father has told me to say."  (John 12:50)<br>
<p>
   He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me.  He <br>
   who loves Me loves my Father.  I will love him and manifest myself to <br>
   him.  (John 14:21)<br>
<p>
   "If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love; even as I have <br>
   kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.  (John 15:10)<br>
<p>
   "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin.  <br>
   Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin."  (John 15:22)<br>
<p>
   "You are my friends if you do what I command."  (John 15:14)<br>
<p>
   " "But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a <br>
   sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are <br>
   written in the Law and in the Prophets. "--  Acts 24:14  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, <br>
   but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous"  (Rom. <br>
   2:13)<br>
<p>
   The behavior of non Christians can bear witness that God's law is <br>
   written in their hearts.  This will be revealed on the judgement day <br>
   when God will judge man's secret thoughts.  (Ro 2:14-16)<br>
<p>
   Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith?  Not at all!  Rather, we <br>
   uphold the law."  (Rom. 3:31)<br>
<p>
   "What shall we say, then?  Shall we go on sinning so that grace may <br>
   increase?  By no means!  We died to sin; how can we live in it any <br>
   longer?"  (Rom. 6:1,2)<br>
<p>
   "Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?  Or <br>
   do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus <br>
   were baptized into His death?  Therefore we were buried with Him through <br>
   baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the <br>
   glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  For <br>
   if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly <br>
   we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection,"  --  Rom 6:1-5  <br>
   (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under the law, <br>
   but under grace.  What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law <br>
   but under grace?  God forbid."  (Rom. 6:14,15)<br>
<p>
     [Not under the law because sin is no longer our master.  Paul is<br>
     not saying here that sin is not our master because there is no<br>
     sin because there is no law.  Jesus and not sin is our master.]<br>
<p>
   "For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by <br>
   the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, <br>
   because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God."  (Rom. <br>
   8:13-14)<br>
<p>
   "Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping <br>
   of the comandments of God." (1 Cor 7:19)<br>
<p>

   homosexuals, thieves, greedy, drunkards, slanderers, swindlers - none of <br>
   these will inherit the kingdom of God.  11 - "And that is what some of <br>
   you were.  But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified <br>

   "No temptation can come upon you that is not common to man: but God is <br>
   faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; <br>
   but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be <br>
   able to bear it."  (1 Cor. 10:13)<br>

   "If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge <br>
   of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful <br>
   expectation of judgement and of raging fire that will consume the <br>
   enemies of God."  (Heb. 10:26,27)<br>

   "But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, <br>
   and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it <br>

<p>
   "For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is <br>
   guilty of breaking all of it.  For he who said,  "Do not commit <br>

   "The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to <br>
   reserve the unjust unto the day of judgement to be punished:  "This <br>
   is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful <br>
   nature and despise authority."  (2 Peter 2:9,10)<br>
<p>
   "Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear <br>
   brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.  He <br>
   writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these <br>
   matters.  His letters contain some things that are HARD TO UNDERSTAND, <br>
   which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other <br>
   Scriptures, to their own destruction.  Therefore, dear friends, since <br>
   you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried <br>
   away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position.  <br>
   But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus <br>
   Christ.  To him be glory both now and forever! Amen."  (2 Peter 3:15-18)<br>

   "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.  <br>
   He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, <br>
   and the truth is not in him."  (1 John 2:3,4)<br>
<p>
   "Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.  He <br>
   who says, "I know Him," and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, <br>
   and the truth is not in him.  But whoever keeps His word, truly the love <br>
   of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.  He who <br>

I just received this email from a friend... what if any is our SDA <br>
church's stand<br>
in this?<br>
<p>
[From Marcus Stringer.  This post is not complete, part of it got cut <br>
off on its way to me.  The Oregon Citizens Alliance was the group which <br>
sponsored the anti-gay referendum in the State of Oregon last fall.  <br>
As I recall, that referendum was defeated.  I know of no church <br>
position on the issue.   SCT]<br>
<p>
Here are the two press releases and the text of the anti-gay initiative in<br>
Idaho, as filed by the Idaho Citizens Alliance and the Oregon/"United<br>
States" Citizens Alliance. All information is public domain and may be<br>
freely distributed/reproduced.<br>

UNITED STATES CITIZENS ALLIANCE<br>
Post Office Box 407<br>
Wilsonville, Oregon  97070<br>
(503) 682-0653<br>
<p>
(Press Statement of March 4, 1993 at Boise, Idaho By Lon Mabon, Chairman,<br>
United States Citizens Alliance)<br>
<p>
Today is an exciting day for conservatives in the great Northwest.  Today,<br>
the vision of a strong grassroots conservative movement that was begun in<br>
Oregon, has grown to become a national vision.  Today, I am pleased to<br>
announce that the newly born Idaho Citizens Alliance will make its maiden<br>
voyage into the political arena.<br>
<p>
With the actions that are begun today comes a call to conservatives in Idaho<br>
and across America to begin to work together as a national movement.  We<br>
stand in solidarity with every conservative community from the good folks of<br>
Tampa, Florida who recently repealed a "sexual orientation" ordinance to the<br>
courageous voters of the pro-family state of Colorado.<br>
<p>
Idahoan's this is your opportunity to join in the wave of the future as the<br>
conservative majority in this wonderful nation begin to take back America<br>
for traditional values.<br>
<p>
I would like to turn this meeting over now to a man who you will get to know<br>
very well over the coming months; a man with whom I have had the pleasure to<br>
serve in this effort to preserve our heritage.  he is a man of integrity and<br>
strength, the founding chairman of Idaho Citizens Alliance, Mr. Kelly<br>
Walton.<br>

This is either from the Denver Post or the Boulder Daily Camera<br>
<p>
Embattled minister takes to airwaves<br>
<p>
LAPORTE -- A LaPorte minister has begun broadcasting nightly sermons via<br>
shortwave radio from his church after the state seized the church's property<br>
in a squabble over an election law violation.<br>
        Pete Peters and supporter Steve Wray have been sleeping at the<br>
LaPorte Church of Christ since it was seized Friday.  Peters remained at the<br>
church Wednesday.<br>
        The state says Peters owes $10,115 in fines for sponsoring political<br>
ads without registering as a political action committee.<br>
        Peters said he doubts the state will stop at seizing church property.<br>
 ----------<br>
Pete Peters is said to be the author of "Death Penalty for Homosexuals,"<br>
It is also being questioned if he is affiliated with one of the White<br>
Supremacist groups (White Aryan Resistance?).  He actually gets 30 minutes a<br>
week of air time here in the Bay Area (Sunday Mornings on KPLA-AM (770) from<br>
9:30 to 10:00).  Last week he explained how high taxes are caused by<br>
America's refusal to condemn homosexuality...<br>
<p>
Does anyone in Colorado know more about this?<br>

<p>
Has anyone ever heard the story of the Bangkok, Thailand SDA hospital?<br>
If you haven't, I can get you a copy of it (its pretty long...20-30 pgs)<br>
to you.  It is pretty amazing.  We picked it up when my wife and I visited <br>
there back in 1987.  It is an amazing story of how they were in financial <br>
struggles and being threatened to close down.  They took a long hard look <br>
at their situation and decided that maybe they were not following God's <br>
plan and counsel as provided by EGW writings.  So they decided to put God <br>
to the test and try implementing changes that were found in EGW's writings.  <br>
Most all the changes centered around what they did on the Sabbath.  They <br>
realized that the Sabbath was not being differentiated from any other day <br>
of the week (sound familiar...in reference to other SDA hospitals around <br>
the US?).<br>
<p>
So they mades changes, such as not charging patients who came in on Sabbath,<br>
they scheduled no surgury for Saturday unless absolutely necessary for life.<br>
There were other changes, which I can't recall right now.  But within a year<br>
or two they had turned their financial picture around so dramatically that<br>
they are now expanding their services and adding rooms, etc.  They definately<br>
feel that it was a result of the changes they made in their attitude about<br>
Sabbath observance.<br>
<p>
I think alot of the SDA hosipitals have totally lost the vision of what they<br>
should be doing as a witness to the community.  They treat health care as<br>
simply a business, not a witnessing tool.  They don`t rely enough on natural<br>
remedies instead of on man made remedies.  Why do they serve meat in some of<br>
the institutions?  Why do they charge for meals on Sabbath in the cafeteria?  <br>
<p>
When I hear of hospitals in financial trouble, I usually like to take a look<br>
at their observance of Sabbath.  How can God bless an institution when they<br>
don't follow His counsel and distinguish themselves from other medical<br>
institutions in the area?  <br>
<p>
I have no idea what the BC hospital does on Sabbath or if they serve meat or <br>
disregard other counsel or not, but I am simply raising the question since I <br>
don't live out there or have not visited it.<br>
<p>
Just my thoughts...<br>
<p>

February's Focus on the Family contained this gem, from its inteview with<br>
Bob Vernon, former LAPD asst chief:<br>
<p>
   I like the way my son put it during his senior year in college.  That<br>
Christmas he said, "Dad, it's like this," stretching his hands out flat in<br>
front of him.  Then he put one about eight inches below the other and slowly<br>
moved both of them down toward his right leg.<br>
   "This is how it is with a lot of Christians," he told me.  "Every day,<br>
we're keeping our eye on the guys in the world, and we figure as long as<br>
we're a cut above them we're okay.  But guess what?  They're going<br>
downhill, so if we keep our eyes on them, we're coming down several<br>
notches, too, as far as our morality is concerned.  We have unwittingly<br>
taken a position of comparing ourselves with the rest of the world.<br>
And as long as we're a little better than they are, we figure we're okay --<br>
but we're really not," said my son.<br>
   I thought, That's really wise for a college kid.  We need a plumb line<br>
to let us know when we're wrong, or else we'll slip into the behavior<br>
of the rest of our culture and not even be cognizant of it.<br>

<i>&gt; The background for my info is this:  In 1987, a family moved to this</i><br>
<i>&gt; area and started attending our church.  They were members of the Reformed</i><br>
<i>&gt; SDA church.  During an elders meeting, the pastor discussed with us re</i><br>
<i>&gt; how to handle the application for membership in our church.  We moved</i><br>
<i>&gt; to Oregon before they were brought into membership, so I don't know the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rest of the details, [..]</i><br>
<p>
A friend's question let me know that I left things hanging more unclear<br>
than I intended.  By "rest of the details", I meant that I did not know<br>
by what means they were brought into membership; that is, whether it was<br>
delicate or straightforward (there are elders from my local church who<br>
are on this list who would know).  Suffice it to say that they (the family)<br>
are active members and make a valued contribution (especially taking on the<br>
youth group 8-).<br>

<i>|It's been interesting to read the conversation on the Unix nets</i><br>
<i>|about the shootout in Waco.  Most of it is actually supportive</i><br>
<i>|of the Branch Davidians, asking what business did the government have</i><br>
<i>|going in shooting, especially since they had no proof that any illegal</i><br>
<i>|weapons were at the compound.  Koresh evidently has a license to own |most </i><br>
<i>|if not all of the weapons he does.  </i><br>
<p>
Where do these people get there news?!!  The raid was not because Koresh<br>
illegally owned guns, but to arrest him for various other illegal<br>
activities, some of which was his marrying many different wives, and<br>
child abuse.  The reason they needed guns was a result of the Branch<br>
Davidians' violent nature.  They had an ATF agent infiltrate the group<br>
for four months.  He reproted on the incredible number of guns, the<br>
militaristic style, and the survivalist attitude of the Branch<br>
Davidians.  They didn't go in shooting, but went in with guns because<br>
they didn't want to get shot back at.  They had to shoot because they<br>
were shot at (the news tape is pretty clear about this). Obviously the<br>
ATF underestimated the Branch Davidians (although the ATF is saying that<br>
the Branch Davidians must have been tipped off). <br>
<p>
<i>|Others have focused on the religious liberty issues this raises,</i><br>
<i>|wondering who will be next with such a raid.</i><br>
<p>
The raid was not religiously motivated.  It has religious overtones<br>
because David Koresh is trying to make it that way.  It should be noted<br>
that Koresh has been in trouble with the law before.  He took over that<br>
compound with weapons from another fanatical religious nutcase who now<br>
sits in prison.  Koresh was charged with assault, but the charges were<br>
not pursued because the government was after the guy who is now<br>
currently in prison.   Branch Davidians are the equivalent in<br>
Christianity that radical Moslem factions are in the Moslem Religion.<br>
<p>
<i>|Marcus Stringer asks, why is our church so little known?  I think it </i><br>
<i>|is because our church has developed an inferiority complex about being </i><br>
<i>|different from the world, while at the same time we have assimilated to it.</i><br>
<i>|If our churches were all places where people could know the love </i><br>
<i>|of Jesus Christ  (some are now, but not enough), we wouldn't have to do </i><br>
<i>|PR or have parades or bake sales or whatever.  People would be breaking </i><br>
<i>|down the doors.  (For that matter, if we could hold half of the visitors</i><br>
<i>|we already get, our churches would soon be too small.)  </i><br>
<p>
Why is our church so little known?  Read Nietzsche.  "God is dead" in<br>
our society.  For most people God is not needed.  The Idea that God's<br>
love will win them over has been used over and over yet we have few<br>
results.  Our problem is that we have no clear definition of what "God's<br>
love" is.  We use examples that describe it, but this never entails a<br>
complete definition.  When the love doesn't work then it must not have<br>
been "God's love" right.  I think this becomes a useless phrase that we<br>
fall back on.  If you look at the well known religions of the world,<br>
they are moslty due to political history (i.e. they control governments,<br>
or did at one time).  Since we advocate separation of church and state,<br>
we will never have the same impact.  <br>
<p>
	Further, I'm not convinced that we need be concerned about getting such<br>
large numbers in our church, or be so well known.  I think it is better<br>
that we concern ourselves with how we, as a church, can be beneficial to<br>
 society.  This will do much more than any PR campaign.  When we get off<br>
our pedestal of "we need to convert the world because only we know how<br>
to worship God," then we will have a church that people see as being<br>
"hey aren't they a neat group, look at what they are doing."  <br>
<p>
	The University Church in Loma Linda California is now involved with<br>
helping the police combat gang influence (no they are not spying and<br>
then turning them in).  They meet gang members to better understand why<br>
they join gangs, they go on activities with gang members such as<br>
camping, and they have the opportunity to teach them social, and<br>
cognitive skills to help them assimilate.  Never, do they go in to teach<br>
them about the SDA religion;That is not the reason for their project. <br>
This is just one activity that the church is involved with.  The church<br>
actually has many projects that they devote to helping the community.  <br>
Bill Lovless, head minister, actually has a section of the church<br>
service discussing their progress, and it is never "how many new members<br>
have we enrolled." The surrounding community knows the SDA church, the<br>
newspaper writes about them with all of their projects, and people don't<br>
feel that they have to watch out for the "sales pitch."  Is this God's<br>
love?  Maybe, but there is no reason why anyone has to be an SDA, or<br>
even Christian to do these things.  The church does them because they<br>
feel that they should provide a benefit to society, not suck people out<br>
of society.   Sometimes it is better to just do what is "human" than<br>
what is "Christian."<br>

I haven't heard anything else by Michael Card, but his lullabyes are<br>
_wonderful_!!  My daughter is a little young yet to really appreciate<br>
them, but I play the tape because I love them so much.  Terrific words<br>
about children and Jesus and sleep.<br>

Oh soul are you weary and troubled,<br>
no light in the darkness you see?<br>
Theres light when you look at the Savior,<br>
and light more abundant and free!<br>
<p>
Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look FULL<br>
in his *wonderful* face.<br>
And the things of earth will grow strangely<br>
dim, in the light of _his_ glory and grace.<br>
=================================<br>
Your post is so true.  Not only do we go downhill when we keep our eyes on the<br>
unconverted "world", but even *more* dangerously, we go downhill looking at<br>
our moral deeds, worshiping our self-supplied righteousness (filthy rags)<br>
THINKING that we are on our way to heaven.<br>
<p>
It's exciting to remember that Jesus is so high, that we can't get over him.<br>
He's so low, that we can't crawl under him.  And he's so wide, that we can't<br>
sneak around him.  When all of our hee-hawing is over, we must face _Him_.<br>

David B wrote _Much_  :  )<br>
======================<br>
Thanks for the post.  I can now locate some texts which have eluded me<br>
for some time... I'd like to add something.<br>
<p>
THE LAW:<br>
God said...<br>
<p>
Don't worship things, self, or other people, only worship me - because I'm<br>
the lover of your soul - worshiping things will make you greedy, selfish,<br>
and you'll try to be self-sufficient.  I've made you so that you need me.<br>
<p>
Please, don't even worship the symbols I've made... for they only to<br>
_point _ to me.  Worship _me_, I'm jealous for your attention.  Worshiping the<br>
symbols will make them more like curses than the blessings they were<br>
intended to be.<br>
<p>
Don't misuse my name.  Don't be careless with it, or you'll be guilty.<br>
You're a Christian, so don't go out of this house talking and living in<br>
opposition to my motives, my underlying principles and my character.<br>
<p>
Remember our family time.  I've marked the day... it's special.<br>
This reminds us all of our relation.  We belong to each other, as I continue<br>
explaining in the rules below....<br>
<p>
Be respectful to your parents, for they gave you birth!  Even when you<br>
disagree, or go separate ways - remember they aren't just any ole' people,<br>
they're your *parents*.  Have integrity, stand up for something, or you'll<br>
fall for anything.  Better yet, think well about what you stand for.  I know<br>
you'll make them proud, and if not, then you'll make _me_ proud.<br>
<p>
I'm not going to tolerate any murdering.  Your business isn't to cleans<br>
each other off the face of the earth.  I'm going to show you later, in greater<br>
detail, why this is so important.  The way this works is that even if you hate<br>
your brother, you have already murdered in your heart.  You don't even have<br>
to hate or swing the bat, just fail to stand against it, and you will <br>
be just as<br>
guilty.  Don't kill his drive to better himself in this life or in the <br>
life to come.<br>
We are going to love each other and in _this_ family.  Oh, I forgot, because<br>
we're members of this family, we are going to love those who don't love us,<br>
do good to people who do bad to us, pray for those who use us....<br>
<p>
I don't want you, hopping from spouse to spouse, spitting upon the covenants<br>
you make to each other.  They are supposed to reflect my covenant, my<br>
relationship with you.  You're special to me.<br>
<p>
Don't take things which don't belong to you.  Don't be greedy.  Work for what<br>
you need and *share* if your sister want's or needs the extra.  You do love<br>
your sister don't you?  Don't swipe away the opportunities for her to have a<br>
better life now and forever.<br>
<p>
Now one thing we don't tolerate in this house, is lying.  Tell the truth!<br>
If it hurts you, tell the truth!  Don't say things about each other <br>
which are not true.<br>
And if you don't know what the truth is, *find out*, before you make a mistake<br>
and paint a false picture.<br>
<p>
Don't lust for things which belong to your neighbor.  If you do, then <br>
you might<br>
want to take it away.  And I've already *told* you about stealing, <br>
killing, lying...<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Well, it appears to me, that they got raided not because of their religion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; but because they broke the law. This of course, raises the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; where to draw the line between religious liberty and the law of the land.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Should religious liberty include being allowed to own an arsenal of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; dangerous weapons and using them to shoot at people?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Weapons, dangerous or not, are not bad in and of themselves. It's the people</i><br>
<i>&gt;who use them and how they use them that can be bad.</i><br>
<p>
I am one who is interested in guns and shooting things. I also agree that<br>
weapons are not bad in themselves, even if they were invented to be used<br>
as weapons.   However, i think that if dangerous weapons are readily<br>
available in abundance, the likelihood of their being used on people<br>
increases, because people who want to use them for bad purposes or who<br>
use them carelessly are unfortunately in abundance too. I guess i am not<br>
used to the idea of weapons being so freely available as they are in<br>
the USA. Where i come from, gun control is very strict and i think even<br>
those who can get a licence for a gun are not allowed to store their<br>
weapons at home, in case they get stolen; they keep them at police stations<br>
or gun clubs i think. The local gangsters usually have to make do with<br>
knives, bottles, and other home-made weapons for their turf wars. Gunshot<br>
wounds are rare in Singapore. Here, catapults are banned and one can be<br>
arrested for carrying around a hunting knife and gun-running is a<br>
capital offense.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why shouldn't religious liberty be extended to those with guns?  As long as</i><br>
<i>&gt;no illegal activity is performed with them, and as long as no laws of the land</i><br>
<i>&gt;are broken, then they should be entitled to the freedom of religion. Our</i><br>
<i>&gt;constitution guarantees it.</i><br>
<p>
I think that guns and religious liberty are usually seperate issues, unless<br>
the religion has something to do with guns. As far as i know, guns do not<br>
form part of most people's religions. There are a few survivalist groups<br>
like the Branch Davidians, i suppose, whose religion calls for them to be<br>
armed for the end of the world or whatever. I suppose if they are legally<br>
owning and using guns, the law should leave them alone. Conflict would arise<br>
only if they illegally own guns or use them illegally and then claim that<br>
they should be allowed to do so because of religious liberty.<br>
	Speaking about constitutions, i know more about yours than i do<br>
about mine. Yours is old and established but mine is changing all the time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Just because someone has dangerous weapons in their posession is no offense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is possible to get licenses for fully automatic weapons (at least it</i><br>
<i>&gt;used to be possible a few years ago).  I don't know if this includes 50-cal</i><br>
<i>&gt;machine guns or not.</i><br>
<p>
Well, Woody Knapper informs me that you can indeed legally procure a 50-cal<br>
MG and even a fully operational battle tank. I used to think that full-auto<br>
weapons couldn't be gotten legally because i read somewhere that some people<br>
buy semi-auto Uzi SMGs or Colt AR-15s and illegally modify them to fire<br>
full-auto.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As for using them for shooting at people, I would say that Koresh and company</i><br>
<i>&gt;were shooting out of self defense.  They were not shooting at innocent</i><br>
<i>&gt;people.  The laws of this land do allow shooting people out of self defense</i><br>
<i>&gt;if the persons attacking you are doing so illegally...such as someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;trying to murder or rape you, etc.  I don't believe this applies in Koresh's</i><br>
<i>&gt;situation since he was firing on law enforcement officers (although he</i><br>
<i>&gt;obviously would have a different opinion on this).</i><br>
<p>
They would be shooting out of self-defense if the ATF men were going to<br>
shoot at them first, which i think unlikely.<br>
	As for shooting in self-defense, is it still legal if the person<br>
attacking you is not going to kill you but perhaps rob or rape you?<br>
 - just curious.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am not condoning Koresh's actions in any way, simply trying to address</i><br>
<i>&gt;the comment that just because you own/possess dangerous weapons and/or</i><br>
<i>&gt;shoot at people means you should have your religious liberty deprived.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, that was not the meaning of what i said. I was asking where to<br>
draw the line when religious liberty conflicts with the law of the land.<br>
When i made that statement(refer to the top of this article for the quote)<br>
i had assumed that owning arsenals and shooting people were illegal.<br>
<p>
For example, if it was part of somebody's religion to take cocaine or to<br>
conduct human sacrifices, and if these activities are illegal, should the<br>
adherents of that religion be allowed to do these things on the grounds of<br>
religious liberty or arrested for breaking the laws of the land?<br>
<p>
regards,<br>
	beng<br>
<p>
[Well, the Smith decision in the US in 1989 made it illegal to take peyote<br>
as part of one's religion.  And the Supreme Court will soon rule on if <br>
animal sacrifice ought to be banned.  Stay tuned.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt;I have no idea what their attitudes and positions are at this time.</i><br>
<p>
I've been told that SDAs aresupposed to be conscientous objectors, but not<br>
necessarily pacifists. They help with the war effort in non-combattent<br>
vocations. I am still trying to make sense of this. While one may not do<br>
the actual squeezing of the trigger, one may be the clerk who types the<br>
order to kill or be the driver who drives the ammunition to the front.<br>
<p>
Ideally, SDAs should serve as medics or perhaps do bomb disposal, or<br>
something which actually helps save lives, but nowadays, even medics are<br>
required to be armed, because they are prime targets for enemy snipers;<br>
now not many people bother about the Geneva convention.<br>
<p>
Here in Singapore, we are fortunate in that the SDA church has a certain<br>
level of understanding with the ministry of defense in that they post our<br>
young men to non-combattent vocations and do not require them to use<br>
weapons. In some other countries the SDAs have to choose to serve in the<br>
armed forces with no regard to their religious scruples of face lengthy<br>
prison terms or other punishments, and some really get a lot of<br>
persecuition.<br>
<p>
I have also herd that up in Myanmar, some of the Karens have converted to<br>
Adventism, but some of these still fight for their lives, against the<br>
Yangon regieme, whith whom they are in the midst of a war. I am not judging<br>
them or anything, i just want to note that the churches' stand on this<br>
issue doesn't seem to be a hard and fast rule everywhere.<br>
<p>
I wonder what Mrs White had to say about wars and fighting and SDAs.<br>
I only remember that she said something about the American civil war.<br>
If anyone has any thoughts about all this, i'd be glad to hear them.<br>

I would again like to address the issue of making the Ellen White<br>
database available via the Internet.  It is my understanding that many<br>
of the original writings are now in the public domain (no longer<br>
protected by copyright); however, this does not apply to the<br>
compilations done after her death (copyrights held by the publishing<br>
houses).  I expect that the machine-readable database itself is also<br>
copyrighted.  The purpose of copyright is to protect the investment of<br>
the originators of intellectual property.  I think we have a legal and<br>
moral obligation to respect copyright and abide by provisions for fair<br>
use.  In general I see the next few years as being years of conflict<br>
between that is technically feasible and legal and financial restraints<br>
placed by producers of information.  In this case, we need to recognize<br>
the investment made by the publishers, and by the White Estate (i.e. in<br>
having all the keyboarding done).  It is unfortunate that at least one<br>
Adventist-related organization has already stolen at least part of the<br>
database and is marketing it themselves.  I do not believe the White<br>
Estate is trying to protect sensitive information or to "make a bundle."<br>
Nor do I believe that they want to enter into litigation.<br>
<p>
However, even if they don't want to "make a bundle," they do want to<br>
recoup their original investment and to have funds to improve the<br>
product.  I think they should be commended for making this a<br>
self-supporting project rather than looking for a church handout.  They<br>
money has to come from somewhere.  At present, I believe they have just<br>
about amortized their original investment.  However, they would like to<br>
produce a new edition (with corrections to mistakes found) as well as to<br>
eventually produce a disc that also includes the unpublished writings.<br>
                                                        ^^^^^^^^<br>
[WHOA!!!  When the volumes of "Manuscript Releases" came out a couple years<br>
ago, there was quite a bit of noise that this was the last of the unpublished<br>
writings and that everything was now in print.  Just what unpublished<br>
writings are you referring to, Harvey?   SCT]<br>
<p>
<p>
I hope we can find a win/win situation where the White Estate's needs<br>
can be met, as well as our interest in making the database available<br>
over the Internet.<br>
<p>
While it might be technically possible to do this without their cooperation<br>
(even I suppose from a country that does not honor US copyright) I do<br>
not believe that would be the right thing to do, and I would urge that<br>
it not be done.  They are understandably cautious in their approach to<br>
this.  Just on Friday, I was writing a belated followup letter to Tim<br>
Poirier at the Washington office (after a visit I had with him in<br>
November).  They want to know more about the Internet (so far the only<br>
Internet connection to the GC is at the GC library).  I hope in the next<br>
few weeks to get Bill Fagal of the White Estate branch office here going<br>
with the Internet (between my online catalog and his dissertation this<br>
hasn't happened yet even though his computers are on the campus fiber<br>
optic network through the library system, and could certainly access the<br>
Internet).  Bill is quite interested in computer technology and would be<br>
a good ally.<br>
<p>
Some questions have been raised about the software for this product.<br>
Because the White Estate has a branch office on our campus (in fact, it<br>
is located in the basement of the library), the James White Library<br>
itself has not felt a need to duplicate what's already available in this<br>
building, therefore I have no personal experience with the software.<br>
However, my library colleages from other institutions feel that the software<br>
itself is not very user-friendly.  That, combined with the purchase of<br>
this product by many novice computer users, led the White Estate to<br>
conclude early on that they were not capable of providing personal<br>
assistance in software support.  They therefore contracted with the<br>
software company to provide this support.  As a result, a substantial<br>
portion of the purchase price goes to that company for software use and<br>
support.  One of the options I will be exploring with the White Estate<br>
is to make their database available using some other software engine so<br>
that we would not have to make arrangements for use of this particular<br>
3rd party software.  <br>
<p>
Several entities (including the publishers) would be involved in this<br>
negotiation, and I continue to urge patience.  In addition, I would note<br>
that purchasers of the product read the license agreement very carefully.<br>
My own experience with such products is that they are usually licensed<br>
for one user, with multi-user licenses sometimes available, but for an<br>
additional fee.  Again, this is usually software-related.<br>
<p>
In conclusion, I hope to be able to spend more time on this project in<br>
the next few months (I will be visiting Washington later this month and<br>
hope to visit the GC at that time).  I believe patience will pay off.<br>
<p>
On another topic, I understand that several other schools in the DC area<br>
have seen large reductions in Anglo students (Sligo School and J. N.<br>
Andrews School come to mind).  I believe something similar has happened<br>
at Atlantic Union College.  However, whether this means that white students<br>
drive by that school (so to speak) to go elsewhere or whether this is<br>
due to chaning demographics in particular areas or regions is hard to<br>
say.  That church demographics show increasing presence of non-Anglos is<br>
beyond dispute.<br>

[From Drew Corrigan]<br>
<p>
Hi All,<br>
<p>
A friend of mine received an item of unsolicited mail - apparently a part of<br>
a large "to the householder" mailing - the other day. This was a booklet<br>
which claims to be extracts from a book written over 100 years ago by <br>
E.B.White. The title is something like "Will America Survive" (though this<br>
is not the title of the original work). The full book is offered for $9<br>
and copies of this booklet for $2. A business called "Four winds Trades" is<br>
given as the place to order copies. What caught my friend's attention is<br>
that the booklet is right down the line with what the WCoG believes.<br>
<p>
Has anyone heard of or does anyone know anything about a "E.B.White"? (Not, <br>
Ellen G. White, but distinctly, E. B. White. - at least according to my <br>
friend.)<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Drew.<br>
<p>
[E. B. White was an American author of children's books including <br>
'Charlotte's Web' and 'The Trumpet of the Swan'.  But somehow I doubt<br>
this would be the same E.B. White.  SCT]<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Just an update of news coverage over here.<br>
<p>
The weekend papers featured 2 full page articles on this issue. The articles<br>
went into substantial detail regarding the Branch Davidians relationship<br>
with the SDA church. Especially mentioned was Koresh's  prophetic interp. and<br>
how this to some extent was derived from the SDA church.<br>
<p>
The articles also looked at Koresh's life since childhood and mentioned<br>
how he mainly recruited his followers from the SDA church and made two<br>
recruiting trips to Australia.<br>
<p>

I am always interested to know who has posted the message I have just <br>
read, but often get to the end only to find no signature. Now I know<br>
I'm lazy, but I just hate searching through the thirty header lines full<br>
of @ signs and colons (don't you love VMS) looking for the name. Please<br>
take pity on me and sign those posts!<br>
<p>
Thanks a lot<br>

[From Tony Dyson]<br>
I'm with Beng on this one. I see the Branch Davidian shootout as another<br>
indictment against the way firearms seem to be so much a part of American<br>
society.<br>
<p>
A friend of mine was a student missionary in Thailand last year, and whilst<br>
there he met a few American sm's. He recounted to me their shock and <br>
disbelief that he had not only never fired a gun in his life, but that his<br>
lack of firearms did not worry him at all and that he didn't feel oppressed<br>
or insecure. <br>
<p>
I applaud the historic stand that America has taken for liberty and freedom<br>
of speech, thought and action. Looking at the results of &gt;200 years of<br>
"liberty", though, I question the way it has been implemented. Koresh has<br>
been quoted as criticizing the governments of Britain, Australia and other<br>
countries for depriving their citizens of firearms, which are necessary for<br>
self-defence. He sees this as oppression of the people. Well, due to my <br>
government's oppressive stance, I am unlikely to face the business end of a <br>
.50 calibre machine gun, licensed or unlicensed.<br>
<p>
The entire firearms debate leaves me slightly bemused, since I personally<br>
have never desired to own or fire one, and I see few legitimate uses for<br>
them in Western society. Obviously, though, there are other Christians<br>
who do feel differently, so it is unlikely that the Christian church will<br>
lead any disarmament crusade. Perhaps we'll have to leave that up to the<br>
new age movement!<br>
<p>
Anyway, the SDA church administration should be very careful what they<br>
publish regarding some of the other splinter groups and "independent<br>
organizations", just in case they are as well prepared for battle as the<br>
Branch Davidians!  ;-&gt;<br>

<p>
-----------<br>
<p>
Isn't that a positive, constructive approach? I don't like being negative,<br>
but I sometimes get the feeling that we as SDAs are worrying far too much<br>
about "distinctives" and institutional survival that we are neglecting the<br>
basics of Christian living. Surely the most important principle of all<br>
is that of being Christ's disciple.<br>
<p>
We can either expend all our energy arguing over just what that means,<br>
or we can "just do it". In the words of a good friend of mine, God gave<br>
us so many good things, that if we spent more time chasing those we wouldn't<br>
have any time to worry about the things that aren't so good. <br>

As a reference librarian, it's always frustrating to try to answer a<br>
second or third hand reference question, as was the question about E.B.<br>
White.  The problem is that often a question needs to be corrected<br>
before it can be answered, and this is hard to do when you can't query<br>
the person with the most information.<br>
<p>
My first approach was to scan titles in OCLC, the huge database of over<br>
23 million bibliographic items that most libraries use to catalog books.<br>
I didn't find anything that fit (but then the question indicated that<br>
this might not be the correct title).  I also had no success with Books<br>
In Print, although I did find that Four Winds Press publishes a lot of<br>
children's books.  In searching OCLC I also found 98 titles published<br>
between 1839 and 1954 by anyone with the initials E. B. White.  Almost<br>
all of these were from the 20th century, and most were by the famous<br>
author of children's books and _The Elements of Style_ and _New Yorker_<br>
author.  Other interesting titles were _The Lady Is Cold_ and a 1929<br>
title, _Is Sex Necessary?_ (maybe they needed such a title that year!).<br>
Without further information I don't think I can accomplish much more in<br>
the national bibliographies (incidentally, I also checked the massive<br>
print _National Union Catalog_ but can't really search for initials and<br>
didn't want to check all of the authors with the last name of White and<br>
a first name beginning with E--although I did notice quite a few<br>
entries for an author whose first name was Ellen!).<br>

Friends of ours were with us  for  Sabbath  dinner  and  I  showed  him  the<br>
following  letter.   He  said  he had received a copy some time ago.  He had<br>
called Mervyn Maxwell to verify that it was not  a  fabricated  or  modified<br>
letter.   Maxwell  was  surprised  that  copies  of  the  letter  were being<br>
circulated, saying he would have changed very little if he had know it would<br>
be circulated.  An officer of the NAD had asked for his feedback on Our Firm<br>
Foundation.   Hense his letter.  The  NAD  officer,  receiving  the  letter,<br>
asked  him  not to circulate it.  Evidently someone at NAD had slipped out a<br>
copy and my friend had received a copy.  What follows is Maxwell's  revision<br>
following   his   discovery  that  the  original  letter  had  escaped  into<br>
circulation.<br>
<p>
-------------------<br>
<p>
On Disciplining Hope International<br>
<p>
Some  general  and  specific  observations,  based  on   a   letter   to   a<br>
denominational  leader  in  response  to  a  request  of  his.  By C. Mervyn<br>
Maxwell, May, 1992.  Revised November, 1992.<br>
<p>
I do not agree with  everything  in   Our  Firm  Foundation.   I  receive  a<br>
complimentary  copy  every month, but I do not subscribe to the magazine and<br>
have never sent a donation.  Ron Spear has called me on the phone  a  number<br>
of  times  over  a  period of several years, but I have never called him.  I<br>
would rather the magazine didn't exist.  But I must add  that  a  number  of<br>
Seminary teachers, I among them, appreciate quite a bit of what is published<br>
in the paper.  Though we deeply regret the critical spirit that  appears  at<br>
times  and  oppose the one-time article on tithing, we nonetheless with that<br>
the best of Our Firm Foundation could appear in the Adventist Review.<br>
<p>
I would like to see the  magazine  voluntarily  cease  publication  sometime<br>
soon,  but I feel that for the time being it fills a useful place in feeding<br>
Christ's sheep.<br>
<p>
In response to your letter requesting my assistance, I make bold to  suggest<br>
several procedures which church leadership might adopt.<br>
<p>
1. Feed the Sheep's Four Hungers.<br>
<p>
The  Review  has  carried  a  variety  of  warnings,  especially  the  Perth<br>
declaration,  aimed against Our Firm Foundation and other private publishing<br>
ventures.  Recently it has published an insert on "Independent  Ministries."<br>
What  I have not yet seen, but would like to see, is an exploration into the<br>
reasons why these private publishing ventures succeed with their publics.<br>
<p>
Career malcontents are going to publish critical materials  no  matter  what<br>
any  committee  comes up with, and neither spiritual appeals nor demagoguery<br>
will  make  them  stop.   If  the  Committee  is  trying  to  reach   career<br>
malcontents, it might as well quote Nehemiah and refuse to waste its time.<br>
<p>
I therefore assume that the Committee is trying to  reach,  not  the  career<br>
malcontents,  bu  the loyal and reasonable church members who send donations<br>
to support the independent publishers.   So  let  us  ask,   "Why  do  these<br>
readers  support  these  private  publishers?"   I'd  like  to  propose four<br>
reasons, four legitimate hungers.<br>
<p>
a. A hunger for what appears to be solid food.<br>
<p>
Our Firm Foundation is notable for its lengthy doctrinal  articles  and  for<br>
its  republished  appeals  by  Ellen  G. White.  Evidently, then, people are<br>
supporting Our Firm Foundation because they want to read  lengthy  doctrinal<br>
articles and they want to read earnest appeals written by Ellen G. White.<br>
<p>
b. A hunger for prophetic interpretation and application.<br>
<p>
Several  of  the   independent   papers   consist   largely   of   prophetic<br>
interpretation  and  application.   Evidently,  then,  people  pay for these<br>
papers because they want to read articles on  prophetic  interpretation  and<br>
application.<br>
<p>
c. A hunger for the serous use of Ellen G. White.<br>
<p>
The conservative publications quote the Ellen G.  White  writings  copiously<br>
and do so as if they regarded the writings as authoritive.<br>
<p>
d. A hunger for sincere repentance by church leadership.<br>
<p>
It is easy to dismiss the Pilgrims Press as merely salacious and  erroneous.<br>
I  assured  you that I don't subscribe to it and only rarely even see a copy<br>
of it.  But a very large number of Adventist church  members  in  the  North<br>
American Division [NAD] are aware that some local and general church leaders<br>
are opinionated, selfish, and power hungry.   Some  of  our  church  members<br>
hunger  for  evidence  of  humility  and  the  character  of Christ in their<br>
leaders.<br>
<p>
Of course, a lot of our NAD members don't have these four hungers, or  don't<br>
have  all  of  them.   And some of them scarcely read any of our papers, not<br>
even their Union papers or the Review.  On the other hand, some are  excited<br>
by Spectrum, with its (a) criticism of Ellen G. White,  (b) rejection of the<br>
sanctuary doctrine  (c) campaign for social activism in  preference  to  the<br>
three  angels'  messages,  and   (d)  advocacy  of a millions-of-years post-<br>
creation-of-life chronology.<br>
<p>
But these people aren't sending their tithe to Our Firm Foundation, so  they<br>
aren't in the Committee's focus.<br>
<p>
Speaking about those who, I presume, are in the Committee's focus, my  first<br>
suggestion  for  reclaiming  the  loyalty of people who read the independent<br>
publications is that as promptly as possible  the  North  American  Division<br>
acknowledge  as legitimate the four deep hungers I have listed and meet them<br>
with<br>
<p>
(a) solid, sound doctrinal articles,<br>
<p>
(b) solid, sound prophetic interpretation and application.<br>
<p>
(c) appropriate respect for the inspired authority of Ellen G. White, and<br>
<p>
(d) evidence of humility  and  character  of  Christ  as  needed  among  our<br>
leaders.<br>
<p>
I have heard (the information may be incorrect) that one of the reasons  the<br>
Committee prepared its big book against the independent publications is that<br>
"third  world"  ministers  are  basing  sermons  on  articles  in  Our  Firm<br>
Foundation.  But of course they are!  Our Firm Foundation appears to meet at<br>
least three of the four hungers.  By contrast, the Adventist Review ---<br>
<p>
a. usually offers little dollops not over six type-written pages in length.<br>
<p>
b. pays only sporadic attention to the fulfillment of prophecy,<br>
<p>
c. virtually never cites Ellen G. White for authoritative direction, and<br>
<p>
d. admits the failings of denominational leadership  only  in  extraordinary<br>
areas of finance (e.g., Davenport and Harris Pine Mills).<br>
<p>
In response to intense criticism,  the  Review  has  commendably  begun  the<br>
Anchor  Point  series;  but  this  series  occupies  only  a fraction of the<br>
available pages.<br>
<p>
To stop Our Firm Foundation, make it seem unnecessary by feeding the sheep's<br>
four hungers.<br>
<p>
2. Avoid Discrimination<br>
<p>
The Quiet Hour accepts some tithe.<br>
<p>
The Voice of Prophecy accepts some tithe.<br>
<p>
The people at Hope International know that the Quiet Hour accepts some tithe<br>
and that the Voice of Prophecy accepts some tithe.  Many other people either<br>
know this or assume it.  If the Committee clamps down on Hope  International<br>
and  not  on  the Quiet Hour and the Voice of Prophecy, it will be guilty of<br>
discrimination.  Worse, it will likely be ineffective -- and will  even  run<br>
the  risk  of  having Our Firm Foundation publish the facts about QH and VOP<br>
and embarrass leadership.  (Added later:  I do not for a moment suggest that<br>
leadership  ought  to  crack  down  on either the QH or the VOP, even though<br>
acceptance of tithe by both of them is contrary to voted NAD  policy.   They<br>
are both doing a noble work and should be encouraged.<br>
<p>
(When Elder Tucker in the 1950s accepted a  call  to  Berrien  Springs,  the<br>
Northern  California  Conference refused to let him take the Quiet Hour with<br>
him from Oakland.  Because the NCC had given the QH a small fraction of  its<br>
operating  cost,  it  persuaded itself that it had full rights of ownership.<br>
Elder Tucker felt abused but stayed loyal.  He waited till the QH in Oakland<br>
failed  through inept leadership before resuming it in Michigan; and when he<br>
resumed the QH in Michigan, he resolved he would never again accept a  penny<br>
from  church  leadership but would, if possible, raise money for the church.<br>
And this he and his sons after  him  have  done,  with  utmost  loyalty  and<br>
devotion.   To  discipline  the  QH for occasionally accepting tithe -- like<br>
Mrs. White did -- from people whose hungers are not being met by leadership,<br>
would be a peculiarly abusive demonstration of "kingly power.")<br>
<p>
Now let me enlarge on the concept of discrimination.<br>
<p>
If our leadership is going to defrock conservatives, it absolutely  must  be<br>
even  handed  and  defrock  supporters  of Spectrum.  (Who the principals of<br>
Spectrum are can be identified by a glance inside any front cover.)<br>
<p>
And what about administrators who promote intercollegiate sports in defiance<br>
of  NAD  policies?   Let us grant that the General Conference has a right to<br>
define where tithe should be paid.  Very well, but if leadership is going to<br>
defrock  conservatives  for  defying  denominational policies on where tithe<br>
should be paid, what is leadership going to about the college  staff  which,<br>
scarcely waiting for the ink to dry on the NAD policy restricting extramural<br>
competition ran an ad on the back of Insight  saying  (as  close  as  I  can<br>
remember), "Meet you at Court Side?"  The college ad listed both the old and<br>
the newly added opportunities at their college for extramural competition.<br>
<p>
If leadership is going to defrock conservatives for defying  "denominational<br>
policy" in regard to where tithe should be paid, what is leadership going to<br>
do about the presidents of the Carolina Conference and the  Southern  Union?<br>
Denominational policy requires Conference presidents and Union presidents to<br>
respond "normally within three weeks" to appeals from  workers  who  request<br>
the  Conciliation  Process.  A certain pastor in the Carolina Conference has<br>
appealed at least five times for the Conciliation Process over a  period  of<br>
nearly  four  years,  but  has  been  given  a  deaf  ear,  in  disregard of<br>
denominational policy.  I have a drawerful of evidence literally, that  this<br>
pastor  has  probably  been  treated  insensitively  and  unfairly.   I have<br>
appealed as a Seminary Professor to the  leaders  directly  involved  asking<br>
them  to  appoint  an independent third party to look into the situation and<br>
see if there might be a basis for the pastor's complaints; but all that each<br>
of  these  (otherwise  effective)  brethren has done in response has been to<br>
consult together and report to me (or not report at all) that everything has<br>
been done just right.  The pastor in question has been fired and is in debt,<br>
with a wife who may well be developing cancer that  they  cannot  afford  to<br>
treat.   Two  individuals who are closer to the pastor than I am, two people<br>
who for many years have been very loyal tithe-paying Seventh-day Adventists,<br>
are  currently  sending  their  tithe  directly  to  this  pastor.   You can<br>
appreciate the fact, that nothing the Committee publishes  on  tithe  paying<br>
will  persuade  these  two  people  to follow "denominational policy" on the<br>
Conciliation Process.  I think you can see their point.<br>
<p>
One other theme, who is speaking out officially in favor of the loyal, tithe<br>
paying  Seventh-day  Adventists  who  for  decades have supported our church<br>
schools and our missionary magazines and the Voice of  Prophecy,  etc.,  who<br>
are  now  deeply  pained  to  attend  their  own  churches  because  of  the<br>
"evangelical  burlesque"  (so-called  Celebration)  going  on  there  in   a<br>
misguided  attempt  to retain the unconverted?  Who is speaking out on their<br>
behalf?  If in a given conference no one is speaking out  on  their  behalf,<br>
can  conference leadership in good conscience blame these loyal tithe-paying<br>
Seventh-day Adventists if, after paying their tithe to  the  conference  for<br>
decades,  they now send some of it to someone who does have courage to speak<br>
out?<br>
<p>
I don't agree with these people  who  don't  pay  all  their  tithe  to  the<br>
conference.   I  only  say that if the Committee is serious about persuading<br>
such members to return to paying all their tithe to the Conference, then the<br>
Committee  should persuade Conference leadership to speak up on their behalf<br>
in respect to the worship- entertainment issue.<br>
<p>
The Committee, I say, must do all  in  its  power  to  avoid  discriminating<br>
against  easy  conservative  targets  while neglecting to tackle the serious<br>
problems that so deeply concern the easy conservative targets.<br>
<p>
3. Evaluate Actual Losses.<br>
<p>
Inasmuch as the tithe is a minor bone of contention, I should  like  to  ask<br>
the  Committee to find out just how much money the NAD is actually losing to<br>
the independent publications.  Is the amount worth the  blood  that  may  be<br>
shed by a frontal assault?<br>
<p>
To determine the money being lost to the NAD, tallying up the income of  the<br>
independent  publications  isn't  good  enough.  It is my current impression<br>
that many of the Adventists who are sending donations to these  publications<br>
would not start sending their money to the Conferences if these publications<br>
were today shut down.  So long as their four  hungers  persist  unsatisfied,<br>
they   will  send  their  money  elsewhere  or  bide  their  time  till  the<br>
publications are replaced with other independent publications.<br>
<p>
What I'm trying to say in this section is that  the  loss  of  offerings  to<br>
these  publications  is  not due to the existence of the publications but to<br>
the doubtful quality of the Review and the apparent  lack  of  humility  and<br>
repentance among some of our leaders.<br>
<p>
I would also like to urge  that  the  amount  of  money  these  publications<br>
receive  is  relatively  small, and that the proportion of tithe involved is<br>
very small.<br>
<p>
Suppose Hope International, the largest  publisher,  does  actually  receive<br>
$1,250,000  a  year  as  Ron  Spear, when I asked him, told me that it does.<br>
Well, the  total  church  contributions  made  by  NAD  Adventists  is  over<br>
$600,000,000.  So Ron Spear gets only 1/500th (0.2%), a sizable amount to be<br>
sure, but scarcely enough to credit him with holding up the general progress<br>
of the cause.<br>
<p>
But what about the tithe he receives, the increment  of  his  earnings  most<br>
zealously  targeted  by  denominational  leadership?  Spear says (I am told)<br>
that only about 10% of his $1,250,000 represents tithe.  By nature he  seems<br>
to  be  an  open man with figures, but let's suppose that the tithe total is<br>
closer to 20%.  Twenty percent of $1,250,000 is $250,000  ----  whereas  NAD<br>
Adventists  give $400,000,000 tithe each year.  So let's figure it out.  The<br>
tithe that creeps  into  Hope  International  represents  at  most  1/1600th<br>
(0.0625%) of total NAD Adventist tithe paying.<br>
<p>
Against the  amount  of  money  that  might  be  regained  by  opposing  the<br>
independent  publications,  the  Committee  will  want to weigh the value of<br>
souls who may become discouraged by a denominational outburst.  What will it<br>
profit  the  church  to  gain  several thousand dollars buy lose hundreds of<br>
souls?<br>
<p>
Leadership in Australia has waged an  all  out  campaign  against  long-time<br>
Seventh-day  Adventists  who  believe  that Jesus was a son of David (rather<br>
than a copy of Adam) and was an Example that by God's grace we can  emulate.<br>
This  bitter  campaign  has  neither  lassoed  the  "concerned Brethren" nor<br>
persuaded them.  If it has done anything,  it  has  made  the  leaders  hard<br>
hearted and the "CBs" desperate.<br>
<p>
It is almost inevitable that castigating Hope International  will  save  the<br>
church  almost  no  money  and  will make many of our laity more hostile and<br>
frustrated.<br>
<p>
4. Remove the Offense.<br>
<p>
You said in your letter that the Committee dealing with  Hope  International<br>
wants  to be "balanced."  This is commendable; and I expect the objective is<br>
sincere.  You ask my comments in a desire to achieve this end.  Inasmuch  as<br>
you asked, let me continue to oblige.<br>
<p>
What about  Spectrum,  which  I  have  already  mentioned,  and  its  parent<br>
organization,  The  Association  of  Adventist  Forums?   If  you don't read<br>
Spectrum, I don't blame you.  But you probably made an  exception  and  read<br>
about Elder Folkenberg and the anonymous donors in the August 1991 issue.<br>
<p>
Is it all right for Spectrum to be sharply critical of  leadership  but  not<br>
for Pilgrim's Press to be critical?<br>
<p>
Far, far more seriously, what about "Growing Up  with  Beasts"  and  "Social<br>
Reform as Sacrament of the Second Advent" in the May 1991 issue of Spectrum?<br>
These articles reinterpret the beasts of Revelation as social ills  and  the<br>
"remnant" as social activists!<br>
<p>
Has the Committee no concern about the  very  prophecies  which  define  our<br>
existence as a movement?<br>
<p>
The Committee should surely savor the relish with which the Spectrum's March<br>
1992  issue,  on  pp.  63-64,  reported  that  Seventh-day Adventist Kinship<br>
International won its trademark  case  with  the  General  Conference.   The<br>
Committee  should  then  read  the  articles  about Desmond Ford and by Ford<br>
himself beginning on pp. 9 and 12 of the March issue.<br>
<p>
Inasmuch as this letter is no longer private correspondence, I  am  deleting<br>
the  names of certain individuals whose behavior and theology are strikingly<br>
out of harmony with normal Adventism.  But I have privately called  them  to<br>
your attention.<br>
<p>
In the meantime, what about the seven papers written by  honor  students  at<br>
Walla  Walla  College  in  the  spring  of  1991 that have received deserved<br>
notoriety?  I understand that Elder Folkenberg has reproved the WWC religion<br>
faculty,  and  I am glad to hope that the report is true.  But will there by<br>
any real change at WWC?<br>
<p>
Very seriously:  What are our people to expect  of  Adventist  education  as<br>
long  as  strong  supporters  of  Spectrum serve as college presidents?  The<br>
president of Atlantic Union College is the man who publicly praised  another<br>
of  our  retired  educators  for  coming out in favor of a millions-of-years<br>
post-creation-of  life   chronology?    Can   we   reasonably   expect   our<br>
conservatives to support our schools?<br>
<p>
As earnestly as I am capable of saying it, if the Committee is serious about<br>
reclaiming   the  loyalty  of  those  people  who  support  our  independent<br>
conservative publications, I urge it first of all to set about removing  the<br>
most obvious offenses.<br>
<p>
Many of our administrators are by nature committee men rather than  theology<br>
men.   By  nature,  they  apparently have no real awareness of the deep pain<br>
being endured by thousands of our loyal north-American  believers.   I  mean<br>
PAIN.  Attending sermons that ignore and often defy the Adventism which they<br>
committed themselves to years ago, is an extremely sever trial.<br>
<p>
5. Review Our History<br>
<p>
Our Firm Foundation, like some of our other  independent  publications,  (1)<br>
worries  about  a  "new  theology"  that it says arose in the 1950s.  It (b)<br>
emphasizes that Jesus had the same human inheritance as we all have,  rather<br>
than  having  been  created  as  clean  as  Adam.   And  it  (c) talks about<br>
perfecting our characters in preparation for the second coming.<br>
<p>
These emphases annoy a branch of our conservatives just as they  also  annoy<br>
our  liberals.   These  annoyed  conservatives almost angrily scold Our Firm<br>
Foundation for emphasizing doctrines that are "not generally agreed  on"  in<br>
our denomination.<br>
<p>
But does their distaste for Our Firm Foundation on these points  prove  that<br>
the magazine is wrong on these points?<br>
<p>
I have taught a course in the development of Seventh-day Adventist  theology<br>
for  over  twenty  years, requiring me to do constant research.  I have also<br>
lived at the Seminary with my antennae out for the same length of  time  and<br>
have  served  as a minister since 1946.  I can say unequivocally that in the<br>
1950s Adventist theology as taught in our NAD centers did undergo a  change,<br>
one  that  can  be attributed especially, but not exclusively, to two of the<br>
editors of Questions on  Doctrine  and  to  at  least  two  fascinating  and<br>
influential  but  highly  controversial  Seminar professors.  This clear and<br>
definite change has been perpetuated and (we must  recognize)  distorted  by<br>
students  of  these  professors who rose quickly to positions of educational<br>
and administrative prominence.  Yes, indeed, there is a "new theology,"  and<br>
Our Firm Foundation is historically correct when it refers to it as such.<br>
<p>
Perhaps, however, we should say more precisely that certain views which  had<br>
been   held  for  some  time  by  a  small  minority  were,  in  the  1950s,<br>
reformulated, given  new  emphasis,  and  taken  up  by  a  group  of  those<br>
Adventists who enjoyed the advantage of attending our schools.  I believe in<br>
our schools, of course (I teach in one), but I observe that the  theological<br>
cleavage  which  exists  today  among conservative NAD Adventists is largely<br>
between those who have studied the writings of non-SDA  theologians  in  our<br>
colleges  on  the one hand and, on the other hand, those who, deprived of an<br>
SDA college education, have confined their study mostly to the Bible and the<br>
writings  of  Ellen  G.  White.   I  AM  REPEATEDLY  STRUCK WITH THE WAY NEW<br>
CONVERTS, FRESH FROM THE STUDY OF THE BIBLE AND ELLEN G.  WHITE,  SIDE  WITH<br>
THE  OLDER  SDA  THEOLOGY,  WHILE SO-CALLED "SECOND-" AND "THIRD-GENERATION"<br>
ADVENTISTS TEND TO SIDE WITH THE NEW  THEOLOGY.   (emphasis  added)    [caps<br>
instead of the underlining provided in Maxwell's revision]<br>
<p>
I should add that language by the QOD editors in defense  of  their  product<br>
set  an  ugly  stage  that  leadership  still needs to sweep clean.  The QOD<br>
editors were deeply embarrassed to have the Evangelicals discover that  many<br>
Adventists  did  not  agree  with  QOD's new theology.  In response, the QOD<br>
editors cruelly denounced the conservatives as a "lunatic fringe."  I knew a<br>
lot of those lunatics and respected them highly.  They included the fine PUC<br>
teachers who set the tone of my ministry.<br>
<p>
Leaders can say things like this, yes; but it seems  hardly  reasonable  for<br>
them to expect people they call lunatics to enjoy paying them their tithe.<br>
<p>
The cry is often raised by the  new-theology  conservatives  that  Our  Firm<br>
Foundation  and  similar publications are terribly wrong when they insist on<br>
the view that Jesus was not given a  pre-fall  nature  like  Adam's.   These<br>
new-theology  conservatives say that the publications are wrong in that they<br>
insist on a view of Christ's nature  that  has  never  been  accepted  as  a<br>
Fundamental Belief of the church as a whole.<br>
<p>
But if the denomination has never taken an official stand on these subjects,<br>
why is it wrong for the old-theology conservatives (like Ron Spear and Colin<br>
Standish) to publish articles on them, but  perfectly  right  for  the  new-<br>
theology  conservatives  to  do  so?  Old-theology conservatives such as the<br>
editors of Our Firm Foundation are frequently criticized for bringing up the<br>
issue.  But let's face it; they didn't start the argument!  The argument was<br>
started publicly by  the  1949  edition  of  Bible  Readings,  by  the  1957<br>
publication of Questions of Doctrine, and by certain Seminary professors and<br>
others in the years that followed.  And the pot has been kept boiling by the<br>
new-theology  liberals  and  conservatives,  who  now control several of our<br>
magazines and colleges.<br>
<p>
One recalls the old quip "You started the fight when you hit me back."<br>
<p>
The fact that new-theology people control the  chief  NAD  publications  and<br>
colleges  represents  choices  made by entities of the NAD.  Choices involve<br>
consequences.  If NAD entities have chosen such editors and presidents,  NAD<br>
must   expect   a   reaction.    It  is  in  my  opinion  irresponsible  and<br>
unsportsmanlike for NAD to choose partisans of new-theology views which have<br>
not  been  officially  accepted  by the General Conference and then cry foul<br>
when loyal church members evidence in favor of the old-theology views  which<br>
they committed themselves to when they became Seventh-day Adventists.<br>
<p>
6. Assess the Implications of Voluntaryism.<br>
<p>
I have just spoken about the  convictions  of  people  who  adopted  certain<br>
understandings   when   they   became  Seventh-day  Adventists.   If  church<br>
leadership thinks the time has come to teach different views from the  views<br>
being  taught  when  these people became Seventh-day Adventists, that is one<br>
thing.  But to treat people as rebellious, heretical, disloyal, and legalist<br>
because  they  choose  to  continue to believe what they sincerely committed<br>
themselves to years ago, seems gross and boorish.<br>
<p>
Commitment is precious, and church membership is sacred.<br>
<p>
Church membership is also entirely voluntary.<br>
<p>
Payment of tithe and offerings in  the  Seventh-day  Adventist  movement  is<br>
totally  unenforceable.   Loyalty  is  unenforceable.   Ours  is a voluntary<br>
movement.<br>
<p>
Members will pay or will not pay tithe as they please.  They will  be  loyal<br>
or disloyal as they please, and no one can force them to be any different.<br>
<p>
How important, then, that our leaders seek consensus rather  than  political<br>
victories.   Our  previous  General  Conference  presidency  was  marked  by<br>
increasingly sharp politicization at the expense of consensus.  You and  the<br>
Committee are painfully aware of this.<br>
<p>
If leadership wants to settle for, say, a vote of 60%, let it do so.  No one<br>
can  stop  it.  But let leadership recognize that when it settles for 60% it<br>
runs the real risk of alienating many of  the  other  40%.   Alienation  and<br>
loyalty are opposite principles.<br>
<p>
The trouble with administrating a voluntary organization  on  the  basis  of<br>
major-fraction  votes  is that the volunteers who are unconvinced may simply<br>
stop being volunteers.  How much better,  how  very  much  better,  for  the<br>
church to move slowly enough and persuasively enough to secure consensus!<br>
<p>
One of the seething causes of the current wave of unofficial publications is<br>
frustration  with  disenfranchisement.  Church leadership, apparently intent<br>
on  retaining  our  educated  liberals,  has  found  ways  politically   and<br>
editorially to give several of the denomination's colleges, periodicals, and<br>
key administrative positions to educated  liberals.   Time  after  time  our<br>
conservatives,  the  ones  who  still read the Spirit of Prophecy, have been<br>
frustrated.  Their articles have been rejected  by  denominational  editors.<br>
And  even  when  they  have written "letters to the editor," too often their<br>
letters haven't been published unless a contrary letter  was  available  for<br>
publication next to theirs, to make their letters look foolish.<br>
<p>
All of  this  maneuvering  has  left  many  of  our  thinking  conservatives<br>
frustrated.  But they love our church more than they love their money.  They<br>
are alarmed at the way things are going  because  they  care  enough  to  be<br>
alarmed;  and  so,  well,  they speak up through their own publications, and<br>
they put their money where their mouths and hearts are.<br>
<p>
They are, after all, volunteers, generous, giving volunteers who support the<br>
kind of Adventism they believe in.<br>
<p>
7. Conclusion.<br>
<p>
It is my conviction, as I said in the beginning, that  Our  Firm  Foundation<br>
ought  to  close  down  -- not be closed down.  We ought not to need it.  We<br>
ought to have an Adventist Review that feeds our people's legitimate hungers<br>
without needing Our Firm Foundation.<br>
<p>
The Review -- and also our colleges, pastors, and teachers  --  should  feed<br>
our people's hunger for solid, sound doctrinal instruction, for solid, sound<br>
material dealing with the fulfillment of prophecy, and for solid respect for<br>
the inspired authority of Ellen G. White.  And our administrators should use<br>
the columns of The Review to make earnest confession, acknowledging specific<br>
wrongs and offering specific restitution.<br>
<p>
The Committee (it seems to me) should persuade  leadership  to  act  without<br>
discrimination,  removing  offenses, and counting the possible gain in money<br>
against the possible loss in souls.<br>
<p>
In brief, in dealing  with  the  supporters  of  Our  Firm  Foundation,  the<br>
Seventh-day  Adventist movement needs to display strong, clear headed, moral<br>
leadership.<br>
<p>
God give us moral leadership, armed by faith, winged by prayer, and informed<br>
by  the  Spirit  of  Prophecy,  its soul cleansed and its influence enhanced<br>
where necessary through public confession and repentance<br>

<i>&gt; From: Trevor Tompkins &lt;tt17+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: Re: Thoughts on the Waco standoff</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; |It's been interesting to read the conversation on the Unix nets</i><br>
<i>&gt; |about the shootout in Waco.  Most of it is actually supportive</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Where do these people get there news?!!  The raid was not because Koresh</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegally owned guns, but to arrest him for various other illegal</i><br>
<i>&gt; activities, some of which was his marrying many different wives, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; child abuse.</i><br>
<p>
It's interesting that the child abuse/polygamy didn't come up until after<br>
the BATF's initial assault failed.<br>
<p>
It's also interesting that they occurred *at all*, since the BATF's<br>
jurisdiction extends only to "Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms".<br>
<p>
The child-abuse allegations, btw, were investigated a while back by the<br>
local sheriff.  He drove over to the farm, told them that there were such<br>
allegations and asked to be allowed in to look for evidence.<br>
<p>
No violence, they cooperated, no evidence found.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; The reason they needed guns was a result of the Branch</i><br>
<i>&gt; Davidians' violent nature.</i><br>
<p>
Other than the "civil war" among the BD factions in 1987, what violent<br>
nature.  (Their neighbors don't seem to be worried about the threat that<br>
they pose to the community.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; |Others have focused on the religious liberty issues this raises,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |wondering who will be next with such a raid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The raid was not religiously motivated.  It has religious overtones</i><br>
<i>&gt; because David Koresh is trying to make it that way.</i><br>
<p>
The media, if not the BATF (although they, too, are working that angle)<br>
are using their religious differences from the mainstream to justify the<br>
operation.<br>
<p>
Here in the U.S., such deviation has often been enough justification for<br>
local, state, and federal governments to do things that would not otherwise <br>
be tolerated.<br>

I have not had the time to follow all the posts on the Waco battle.<br>
So excuse me if this is redundant.<br>
<p>
This week-end I heard an explanation about their guns.  Their philosophy<br>
comes from Ezekiel 9, regarding the man with the writing kit followed<br>
by the five men with destroying weapons.  They start killing at the<br>
alter.  According to the Davidians, they are the killing team and<br>
the SDA GC is the alter at which they are to start.<br>
<p>
If this has already been discussed then email would be appreciated.<br>
Else, can anyone confirm/deny this for SDAnet.<br>

I wonder what is the general opinion out there.  Do we believe that the church<br>

would say that we have left the distinctives and do not follow them enough.<br>
the Liberal would probably say that that is all we talk about.  I guess we<br>
never hear what we want to hear enough, and we always hear too much that which<br>
we do not want to hear.  I guess I would agree that we could spend more time<br>
teaching the basics of CHristian living, but do we spend too much time on<br>
distinctives?<br>

Perhaps this information already made the net and I didn't see it --<br>
I seem to have missed some of the messages on this topic.  However, in<br>
case nobody has already mentioned it, this information on the Branch<br>
Davidian cult (like in Waco) came from someone interviewed on National<br>
Public Radio.  The Branch Davidians (BD) began to separate from the<br>
SDA church in Southern California in the late 1930s.  In 1942 they<br>
officially split off over the subject of pacificism -- the BD were<br>
completely pacifist at that time and the regular SDA church was not.<br>
Obviously something happened in the intervening years.  There are about<br>
1500 BDs in the US and about that many more elsewhere in the world.<br>
The 1500 US members are spread across about 7 congregations, one of<br>
which is in Waco, Texas.  Apparently none of the others is prone to<br>
stockpiling arms, and the Waco branch were influenced in that direction<br>
by their leader.  This is not the first time there has been shooting<br>
down there -- when we lived in Oklahoma there was a shootout between<br>
followers of two divergent prophets of the BD in Waco.  Nobody was<br>
killed, or even harmed seriously in that outbreak however.  This David<br>
Koresh guy had practiced his group in an endtime scenario when he<br>
believed the forces of the world would attack them because of their<br>
beliefs.  Obviously, when they were stormed by the agents it looked<br>
as though that time had arrived.<br>
<p>
Sorry if this was already well-known by everyone.<br>

I think we need to start concentrating on the positive aspects of this.<br>
It seems funny, but this week kicks off the largest evangalistic effort<br>
in the history of the Texas conference.  It has been in the planning for a year.<br>
It involves 20-30 crusades to be held in Houston Texas.  The SS superintendant<br>
called me friday evening about 7 p.m. and asked me to substitute for him, as<br>
well as to teach the main ss class.  Said Mission Spotlight would take llmost<br>
of the time.  Well, it did not come.  In a conversaion with our pastor, he<br>
related the events of the past week, so I got him up front to tell about them.<br>
I spent a good deal of time talking about SDA-NET, and how it was providing<br>
a good clearing house for information dealing with the waco thing, and <br>
presented our efforts.  Beng should know that I specificaly mentioned his<br>
continual updating of the Singapore coverage.  Any way, our pastor was<br>
watching the news when the initial announcment came over the air last<br>
<p>
Sunday.  He immediatly called the station, and requested that they take the<br>
words "Seventh-day Adventist background" off the screen in conjunction with<br>
the story, which they did.  The station called him up for an interview, but<br>
he declined because he did not want to as a representative of the SDA church,<br>
promote the connection, which he felt that he would be doing.  Later another<br>
station called him up, and he gave them the same response.<br>
<p>
The local newspaper called him up, and told him that they wanted to do a<br>
complete in-depth coverage of the Seventh-day Adventist church, and would<br>
he be willing to give an interview.  After assuring him that they would not<br>
bring the branch davaidians into the article, he spent an hour and a half<br>
talking with the reporter, detailing adventist history.  The reporter asked<br>
him if there were any contridictions in the bible, whereupon he said that there<br>
were some apparent contradictions, and gave him the example in revalation<br>
where it says that the wicked are completely burned up, and then says that<br>
they burn for ever and ever.  He then proceeded to reconcile those with each<br>
other, explained how they were NOT a real contridiction, and wound up involved<br>
in a bible study with the guy.  I have not seen the article, but I am going<br>
to try to find a copy of it.  If we are careful, we as a church may be able<br>
to take advantage of the publicity surrounding this event, to show our unique<br>
point of view.  There has been a decidedly increased awareness of the <br>
Adventist church, with our offical disclaimers and all, and if we seize the<br>
moment, we should be able to turn some of the publicity to our advantage.<br>
especially, by contrasting our beliefs with those of the Davidains.<br>
<p>
It turns out that there are 8 people in waco who are ORIGIANL Davadian<br>
association of Seventh-day Adventist.  Apparently the waco group split<br>
and part of them moved off to this 77 acres outside of waco, that they are<br>
now calling Ranch Apocolypse.  the origianl Davidians apparently still attend<br>
the waco church, and have regained control over the remaining 7 acres of the<br>
origianal Mt. Carmel site, where they carry on thier publishing activities.<br>
<p>
The fact that they meet with the local adventists should be some cause for<br>
alarm I would think.<br>
Cheers<br>

<i>&gt; From: med10014@nusunix3.nus.sg (TANG BENG YONG)</i><br>
<i>&gt; To: st0o+@andrew.cmu.edu</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: Re Pacifism</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been told that SDAs aresupposed to be conscientous objectors, but not</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessarily pacifists. </i><br>
<p>
Here in the U.S. we've made an even finer distinction, mostly because of<br>
the way terminology is (was) used for draft classifications.<br>
<p>
Conscientous objectors (classification 1-O) are people who refuse to have<br>
anything at all to do military duty.  In the past, they used to go straight<br>
to jail, do not collect $200.  Later they were offered, and usually accepted,<br>
non-military service of some sort.<br>
<p>
One level away from this was the 1-AO ("conscientious cooperator"), those<br>
who would accept military service, but no combat position.  SDA's in the<br>
U.S. seem to moslty have gone that way (with a minority either taking 1-O<br>
or 1-A on either side).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They help with the war effort in non-combattent</i><br>
<i>&gt; vocations. I am still trying to make sense of this. While one may not do</i><br>
<i>&gt; the actual squeezing of the trigger, one may be the clerk who types the</i><br>
<i>&gt; order to kill or be the driver who drives the ammunition to the front.</i><br>
<p>
In most cases this would not be correct: a truck driver, engineer, typist,<br>
etc., would be at least possibly combat-related: they all receive weapons<br>
training.  (And in the Marines, for example, *everyone* is a rifleman first,<br>
and whatever second.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ideally, SDAs should serve as medics or perhaps do bomb disposal, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; something which actually helps save lives, but nowadays, even medics are</i><br>
<i>&gt; required to be armed, because they are prime targets for enemy snipers;</i><br>
<i>&gt; now not many people bother about the Geneva convention.</i><br>
<p>
Which must explain why most of my friends from academy and college who saw<br>
service in Viet Nam (or, previously in WW2 or Korea who were SDA at that<br>
time) who were medics on the front line didn't carry a weapon.  (There were<br>
some advantages here: without the normal weapon/ammo load, they could carry<br>
more medical supplies, and they weren't distracted by having to think about<br>
trying to defend themselves.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Here in Singapore, we are fortunate in that the SDA church has a certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; level of understanding with the ministry of defense in that they post our</i><br>
<i>&gt; young men to non-combattent vocations and do not require them to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons. </i><br>
<p>
Works here, too.  But it isn't automatic, you would have to request non-combat<br>
positions.<br>
<p>
Actually, now that the military is all-volunteer now, you won't have the<br>
option.  It's one thing to be drafted, it's something else entirely to volunteer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In some other countries the SDAs have to choose to serve in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; armed forces with no regard to their religious scruples of face lengthy</i><br>
<i>&gt; prison terms or other punishments, and some really get a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; persecuition.</i><br>
<p>
Up until WW1, this was the situation in the U.S.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have also herd that up in Myanmar, some of the Karens have converted to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Adventism, but some of these still fight for their lives, against the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yangon regieme, whith whom they are in the midst of a war. I am not judging</i><br>
<i>&gt; them or anything, i just want to note that the churches' stand on this</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue doesn't seem to be a hard and fast rule everywhere.</i><br>
<p>
The Bible itself makes a clear distinction between offensive and defensive<br>
use of force.  (Ought to be good for a healthy discussion... :} )<br>

A few years ago I posted a sort of parable about two husbands, this was<br>
posted to s.r.c.<br>
<p>
The first husband was meticulous about the birthdays of family members<br>
and their wedding anniversary.  Full blown celebration for each event.<br>
But the rest of the year he was not a very attentive husband, being more<br>
of a workaholic with his job.  His marriage eventually failed.<br>
<p>
The other husband, by way of illustration, was watching TV and the talk<br>
show host was interviewing the author of a new book.  The book documented<br>
the results of a questionaire in which one of the questions was -- would<br>
you divorce your husband because he never bothered with birthdays and<br>
anniversaries.  The unanimous answer from the wives was that they would<br>
not divorce their husbands over that.  And so the 2nd husband resolved<br>
immediately that he would make himself completely aloof from these<br>
events in the lives of his family -- reasoning that -- why bother if<br>
its not going to cost me my marriage.  That attitude led to the neglect<br>
of other things and . . . . . .   If it seemed that something would<br>
not cost him his marriage he couldn't be bothered.   His marriage ended<br>
in divorce.  Not because his wife dumped him, in fact she tried<br>
desperately to energize the marriage.  Rather, the husband simply<br>
became increasingly aloof from his marriage and family.  The time<br>
came when his interrests were caught up with another woman, in fact<br>
he came to celebrate her birdays, and . . . . .<br>
<p>
These two husbands illustrate two forms of legalism.  The first husband<br>
kept the law as if it would preserve his marriage.  But the day by<br>
relationships throughout the year meant nothing to him.  His marriage<br>
failed.<br>
<p>
The second husband was also a legalist in that he could not be bothered<br>
with anything that would not immediately cost him his marriage.  The<br>
second husband started out as an attentive husband and father.  But<br>
his attitude of getting by on the minimums led to his eventual divorce.<br>
<p>
Both kinds of legalism can cost us our salvation.  Certainly Jesus<br>
would have us married to him.  But too often we let the marriage fail.<br>

Below is one of the newspaper report I found:<br>
<p>
The media in Hong Kong reported the shootout in detail.  The leader of the<br>
cult is David Koresh, 33, who previously went by the name Vernon Howell and<br>
is said to believe he is Jesus Christ.  His group is called "Branch<br>
Davidian".  Koresh told the CNN television network by telephone that he<br>
would release two children each time the radio station played the tape he<br>
dictated to federal agents.  The tape is about the group which believes in<br>
free love and that the end of the world is near.  4 FBIs and 2 of Koresh's<br>
followers were killed during the shootout.<br>
<p>
The group claimed that it was a branch of SDA but SDA declined to have any<br>
relations with this group.  "Branch Davidian" was founded in LA in 1933 and<br>
was actually separated from the SDA church at that time.  The founder was<br>
from Bulgaria and he believed Jesus would return in 1934.  After his death,<br>
his wife prophesized that Jesus would return on April 22, 1959.  Then the<br>
group was divided into two and "Group Dividian" was one of them.  Koresh<br>
started to lead the group in 1984.<br>
<p>
Looks like Koresh has nothing to do SDA.  It was the founder of the cult who<br>
was once an SDA.<br>
<p>
Hope this mail can give you some information about the cult.  There are<br>
plenty of information I found but that was written in Chinese.<br>

Thanks for the doctrinal statement.<br>
I've perused it and find it quite interesting.<br>
In many regards, my beliefs are quite similar<br>
to those stated in this document.<br>
<p>
As you probably realize, the most "distinctive"<br>
distinctives in this document are those which<br>
are directly traced to Ellen G. White.  I have<br>
an honest question:  What relative weight is given<br>
the teachings of EGW which are not directly<br>
substantiated by the scriptures, compared to that<br>
which is clearly taught in the scriptures?  By <br>
and large, does the average man (or woman) in the<br>
SDA church place the same emphasis on the prophecies<br>
of Ellen White?  Is adherrence to her teaching a<br>
test of fellowship?<br>
<p>
Thanks for considering my questions.<br>
<p>
In Christ,<br>
Scott Hinks<br>

<i>&gt; Steve Timm writes:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, the newspaper said that an ATF agent was hit by a round from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 50-calibre machine gun.</i><br>
<p>
There's been no followup on that report.  On the other hand, since the<br>
media were there filming the initial assault, it's been possible to<br>
review the video.  The .50 BMG has a *very* distinctive sound...and that<br>
sound is nowhere evident.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I may be wrong, but I doubt you can get a licence</i><br>
<i>&gt; for that, even in Texas.</i><br>
<p>
The National Firearms Act of 1934 set out the rules for legal ownership<br>
of full-auto firearms.  You *can*, except in a couple of states like<br>
California and New Jersey, get a permit to purchase and own full-auto<br>
firearms.  It costs a lot, requires an extended permit process including<br>
an extensive background check.<br>
<p>
Oh yes, since 1934 there have been all of three occurances of legally-owned<br>
(as per NFA-34) full-auto firearms involved in criminal use.  Or so I<br>
understand...I've only been able to find real references for two.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, it appears to me, that they got raided not because of their religion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but because they broke the law. </i><br>
<p>
But what law?<br>
<p>
The BATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) deals only in those<br>
items.  They're part of the Treasury department, and are basically tax<br>
collectors.<br>
<p>
Initially, they reported that they (BATF) reported that they were serving<br>
a warrant issued to *search* the compound for reported firearms violations.<br>
<p>
Rather an energetic search, it seems to me.  Oh yes, the BATF issues those<br>
Class III (full-auto) permits and collects the taxes on them.  If, as has<br>
been said, the .50 was owned by Koresh, and if Koresh does really have a<br>
Class III firearms permit...the BATF would have issued the permit.<br>
<p>
Allegations of child abuse and polygamy were brought up later to justify<br>
the raid.  (Don't ask *me* why...these aren't crimes under the BATF's<br>
jurisdiction.)  Don't forget, the local sheriff investigated the child<br>
abuse allegations a while back.  Drove over to the farm, asked to look<br>
around to see if there was any evidence that they might be true.  No<br>
shooting either way, no violence, ...<br>
<p>
I am beginning to fear that the BATF has been other than perfectly frank<br>
with us regarding their motives and goals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This of course, raises the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt; where to draw the line between religious liberty and the law of the land.</i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Should religious liberty include being allowed to own an arsenal of</i><br>
<i>&gt; dangerous weapons and using them to shoot at people?</i><br>
<p>
Don't mix the two.  Ownership is one thing.  Harming others is something<br>
else entirely.<br>
<p>
We don't punish people (*God* doesn't punish us) because they might<br>
possibly hurt someone, but punishment is supposed to result from the<br>
*act* of harming another.  Otherwise, we'd *all* be in jail, or be<br>
lost forever.<br>
<p>

<i>|&gt; Where do these people get there news?!!  The raid was not because Koresh</i><br>
<i>|&gt; illegally owned guns, but to arrest him for various other illegal</i><br>
<i>|&gt; activities, some of which was his marrying many different wives, and</i><br>
<i>|&gt; child abuse.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|It's interesting that the child abuse/polygamy didn't come up until after</i><br>
<i>|the BATF's initial assault failed.</i><br>
<p>
Would you expect them to announce a raid?  Contrary to the first<br>
posting, the ATF stated that they did have reason to believe that there<br>
were illegal firearms and explosives.  So I was wrong,  the other<br>
allegations were another side story about the so called messiah.<br>
<p>
<i>|It's also interesting that they occurred *at all*, since the BATF's</i><br>
<i>|jurisdiction extends only to "Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms".</i><br>
<p>
Right!<br>
<p>
<i>|The child-abuse allegations, btw, were investigated a while back by the</i><br>
<i>|local sheriff.  He drove over to the farm, told them that there were such</i><br>
<i>|allegations and asked to be allowed in to look for evidence.</i><br>
<p>
<i>|No violence, they cooperated, no evidence found.</i><br>
<p>
Of course there is no evidence, the witnesses believe he is the son of God.<br>
  <br>
<i>|&gt; The reason they needed guns was a result of the Branch</i><br>
<i>|&gt; Davidians' violent nature.</i><br>
<p>
<i>|Other than the "civil war" among the BD factions in 1987, what violent</i><br>
<i>|nature.  (Their neighbors don't seem to be worried about the threat that</i><br>
<i>|they pose to the community.)</i><br>
<p>
And apparently the civil war in 1989, according to "A current affair" (I<br>
know there not the most reliable).  However, do you need more than a<br>
civil war that involved military styled shootings?  Also, if you see the<br>
pictures on the news, the neighbors are nowhere in sight. I live closer<br>
to violent areas than the BD's neighbors.<br>
<p>
<i>|&gt; |Others have focused on the religious liberty issues this raises,</i><br>
<i>|&gt; |wondering who will be next with such a raid.</i><br>
<i>|&gt; </i><br>
<i>|&gt; The raid was not religiously motivated.  It has religious overtones</i><br>
<i>|&gt; because David Koresh is trying to make it that way.</i><br>
<p>
<i>|The media, if not the BATF (although they, too, are working that angle)</i><br>
<i>|are using their religious differences from the mainstream to justify the</i><br>
<i>|operation.</i><br>
<p>
When a religion not only advocates violence against others, but also<br>
uses it, I think that is a religious difference from the mainstream to<br>
justify such an operation.  The rest, such as Koresh preying on<br>
psychologically weak, His unjustified claims of being the Messiah, and<br>
telling his followers that God wants the women of the church to be his,<br>
just adds to incredibleness of it all.<br>
<p>
<i>|Here in the U.S., such deviation has often been enough justification for</i><br>
<i>|local, state, and federal governments to do things that would not otherwise </i><br>
<i>|be tolerated.</i><br>
<p>
In this case the deviations match what we often call organized crime,<br>
but in this case they are called, Branch Davidian.  There are all kinds<br>
of organizations in the U.S.  The one's that should be shut down are the<br>
one's that break the laws set up in our society (like organized crime). <br>
 Just because an organization is "religious," doesn't mean can it break<br>
these laws.  Religious organizations can believe what they want to, but<br>
if these beliefs turn into actions that break laws, then they need to<br>
taken to task just like any other organization.  If the Branch Davidians<br>
were a telemarketing firm (and I don't see much difference beside the<br>
violence) they would have the same action taken against them.  In fact,<br>
there was a raid recently that did, just that.  And the telemarketers<br>
didn't even shoot anyone.  They did prey on innocent people for their<br>
own benefit however.<br>
<p>
I certainly don't think the government always acts correctly (not even<br>
half the time).  But so far, this particular case reveals a group of<br>
people who do not think that they need to follow the same laws as we do<br>
(they probably also don't mind the attention either).<br>

To SDAnet,<br>
<p>
For those who are curious:<br>
<p>
San Jose (California) Mercury News have printed articles and opinions<br>
on the Branch Davidians every single day since March 1.  It's been<br>
covered in the front pages (about five or six day for the past eight<br>
days) and in the religion section (this past Saturday), along with few<br>
opinion sections, including a letter to the editor by an SDA minister.<br>
Apart from the minister's remark, I only saw two references to SDA --<br>
once in the Mar 1's first page, and the other in the religion section.<br>
<p>
In Yomiuri Shinbun -- a Japanese daily newspaper -- there were only<br>
two articles on the Waco incident for the past week (up to Mar 7), and<br>
the only denomination mentioned was Seventh-day Baptists(!!) -- not<br>
once about SDA.  In fact, the two articles never made the front pages<br>
(things like bribery scandals and strong yen did).  The English<br>
version of Yomiuri Shinbun had two front page articles on it (Mar 2<br>
and 3), but they dealt only with the Branch Davidians.  Yomiuri<br>
America (published in Japanese, once a week, exclusively on American<br>
news -- this includes Canada and Latin America) was completely silent<br>
this past Friday about Waco.<br>

It is my understanding that the Davidian Branch is an off-shoot of the Shepherd<br>
's Rod. The Shepherd's Rod is an off-shoot of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.<br>
They broke away during the first half of this century. One of the Davidian's<br>
stated goals was to stockpile enough arms so they could destroy the SDA's whom<br>
they considered to be apostates and their mission was to destroy the apostates.<br>
Aparently the ATF division (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) of the Federal<br>
Government took exception to the large number of arms they had assembled.<br>
<p>
Please correct me if I am wrong!<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This week-end I heard an explanation about their guns.  Their philosophy</i><br>
<i>&gt; comes from Ezekiel 9, regarding the man with the writing kit followed</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the five men with destroying weapons.  They start killing at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; alter.  According to the Davidians, they are the killing team and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the SDA GC is the alter at which they are to start.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If this has already been discussed then email would be appreciated.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Else, can anyone confirm/deny this for SDAnet.</i><br>
<p>
Wow! is this true ?<br>
<p>
They must be really wacky <br>
<p>

[From Drew Corrigan]<br>
<p>
Earlier I asked about the identity of "E.B.White". Unfortunately my friend<br>
got it wrong - it was Ellen G White who authored the booklet he received in<br>
his mail. His further comments were:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; After mentioning the pamphlet to a couple of other people here, it appears</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the SDA have blanketed at least the entire province of Nova Scotia</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a bulk mailing of the pamphlet.</i><br>
  [...]<br>
<i>&gt; In any case, it gives me pleasure to see a document containing a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard-hitting bible-based truth being direct-mailed to all the homes in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the province. The booklet is pretty hard on the Catholic Church however,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and may loose some effectiveness by quickly polarizing anyone who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; sympathetic to Catholicism.</i><br>
<p>
Just clearing up the confusion,<br>
<p>
Drew. <br>

I have read the posts about pacifiscm with some amusment and also some<br>
aprehension.  The church that my wife and I attended when we became<br>
adventists was located outside of an Air Force base on which I was<br>
stationed.  They never mentioned the fact that the church took a <br>
pacifistic stance.  I subsequently heard about it after I left the<br>
Air force and resumed civilian life.  I was upset that people took<br>
such a strong stance on it and that I had never heard about it before<br>
I have since just let the issue drop but feel that either I was <br>
decieved by the church or there is a wide disparity in positions<br>
held on this issue.  <br>
<p>
I worked with nuclear weapons and carried arms in the Air Force and <br>
would do it again today if I had it to do over again.  I would also<br>
support any one of my children entering the military if they so<br>
chose to do so in what ever capacity they would chose.  I feel strongly<br>
about my rights to bear arms and have recently been shopping for firearms.<br>
I fear from the descusion that I read on SDAnet I fall despretly short<br>
on the christian lifestyle ladder because of my beliefs.  Is the church <br>
really such a strong "peace" church or is the tone of the conversation<br>
just much stronger then the actual beliefs?<br>
 <br>

SDANetters:<br>
<p>
Help me either substantiate or dispell a rumor I've heard when I attended<br>
church last Sabbath. <br>
<p>
There was a report that, as an aftermath to the shootout, a number of<br>
residents burned down a SDA church in Waco. This particular member of<br>
the church also told me that the pastor here at North Shore Chicago<br>
knows about it, but won't say anything lest it caused an uproar.<br>
The pastor had his start as a student pastor in the Waco area, and<br>
is very familiar with the Branch Davidians' activities. <br>
<p>
Why was it not in the press, I asked the person. He said that, because<br>
the media is so hung up on the incident itself, they didn't take<br>
notice of the retributions going on.<br>
<p>
BTW, the president of the Illinois Conference sent to all comm secy's,<br>
including me, a copy of a press release re BD and its differences<br>
and history with the SDA church last Friday. I'd use it in my<br>
newsletter, but, by the time the April issue comes out, I'd hope the<br>
Waco incident would be resolved. At this rate, though, David Koresh<br>
may have more believers in his divinity outside of his compound. Sigh!<br>

Take a medic who repairs combat troops. Those troops whose lives have been<br>
saved then go back to fight some more. So the medic is doing just as much<br>
to aid the killing as "the clerk who types the order to kill" or the truck<br>
driver carting the ammunition.<br>

The local paper reported that most of the automatic weapons were purchased<br>
as normal semi-automatic weapons (example AR-15, which is the civilian semi<br>
auto only version of the M-16), and then were converted by the group to full<br>
auto.  The conversion for the AR-15 is fairly straight forward.  Replace the<br>
ar-15 bolt with an M16 bolt (legeal), replace the hammer with an M16 hammer<br>
(once again legal), replace the disconnector with an M16 selector lever<br>
(again legal), install the auto-sear. (Illegal without getting the BATF<br>
permit.)  Plans are available for manufacturing an auto-sear that drops in,<br>
requiring no modificaton to the reciever.  Now, it should be said that you<br>
CAN get in trouble for installing the bolt, hammer, disconnector and<br>
selector lever, but it is leagal to buy them.  The M-16 bolt is a better<br>
bolt.  However, it requires all parts to be truly functional.<br>
<p>
This conversion is strictly Illegal unless you have the permit, and go <br>
through the background check.  It seems that this is what the group did.<br>
No way to trace the weapon, simple to do (a file, drillpress, hacksaw and<br>
vice, and a level of knowlege that any high school student posses).<br>

----&gt;<br>
I have read the posts about pacifiscm with some amusment and also some<br>
aprehension.  The church that my wife and I attended when we became<br>
adventists was located outside of an Air Force base on which I was<br>
stationed.  They never mentioned the fact that the church took a <br>
pacifistic stance.  I subsequently heard about it after I left the<br>
Air force and resumed civilian life.  I was upset that people took<br>
such a strong stance on it and that I had never heard about it before<br>
I have since just let the issue drop but feel that either I was <br>
decieved by the church or there is a wide disparity in positions<br>
held on this issue.  <br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I can understand how you felt there, Russell. Perhaps your fellow<br>
church members didn't want you to feel that you didn't fit in as<br>
a part of the church group, and couldn't think of a non-critical<br>
way to tell you that they were not in favour of carrying arms. <br>
Besides, as you have suggested, I think there *is* a wide disparity<br>
in positions held on this and many other issues.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
I worked with nuclear weapons and carried arms in the Air Force and <br>
would do it again today if I had it to do over again.  I would also<br>
support any one of my children entering the military if they so<br>
chose to do so in what ever capacity they would chose.  I feel strongly<br>
about my rights to bear arms and have recently been shopping for firearms.<br>
&lt;---- <br>
<p>
Surely a person can be anti-war and anti-violence and still bear arms<br>
in the military, just as one can be anti-abortion and still be pro-choice.<br>
I myself, were I to join the military, would not refuse to serve in a<br>
combatant role, although I doubt that I would relish the experience. (The<br>
real thing is a bit of a far cry from Falcon 3 and AOTP, which I do relish).<br>
<p>
At the same time, I was one of those who posted to the net regarding guns.<br>
In my *personal* opinion, a firearm is an item of hardware designed <br>
specifically to maim or kill another living creature, and I am opposed<br>
to their proliferation in society around me. I have friends who feel<br>
differently, and they are still my good friends. Besides, you have to<br>
understand that I have grown up outside the U.S., and I think that my<br>
attitude to various things reflects that.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
I fear from the descusion that I read on SDAnet I fall despretly short<br>
on the christian lifestyle ladder because of my beliefs.  Is the church <br>
really such a strong "peace" church or is the tone of the conversation<br>
just much stronger then the actual beliefs?<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I could be wrong, but I think most Christians are in favour of peace. But<br>
basic human rights is another thing we are all in favour of. Sometimes we<br>
have to choose between a set of poor options, and try to select the best<br>
one. Just as an example, I can cite the current situations in Iraq, Bosnia<br>
and Somalia. To be "pacificist" to the extent that others can be oppressed<br>
I believe to be wrong.<br>
<p>
The carrying of arms is an issue which you can argue about until the<br>
ethernet melts, but outside of a situation requiring an actual decision it<br>
is all fairly academic. As I said, I am strongly opposed to the proliferation<br>
of firearms in society, but were I to live in a place where my life was in<br>
danger, maybe I would own one myself, and learn how to use it. I don't know.<br>

<p>
Two anecdotes re private bearing of arms:<br>
The head deacon of the church I attended in Oregon runs an auto body shop.<br>
He has a good size shop, with many specialized, expensive tools.  A few<br>
years back, his shop was broken into and several thousands of dollars<br>
worth of tools were stolen.  He started sleeping over in his shop.  One<br>
night, an intruder cut through an aluminum garage door and entered.  He<br>
was challenged by my friend to drop his knife and spread-eagle.  Instead,<br>
the intruder charged my friend, to attack him.  My friend pulled out his<br>
pistol and shot the intruder in the leg, disabling him; clear self-defense.<br>
My friend offered to resign his position as head deacon, but the church<br>
board felt that was not necessary.<br>
<p>
Re arms and sports:  A friend of mine in Southern Ontario, Canada, has<br>
been Canadian National Champion several times in his marksmanship specialty,<br>
distinguished himself at the Olympics, and was World Champion during a<br>
non-Olympics year.  He gives a powerful testimony on God's leading in his<br>
life, and draws parallels between the disciplines required to become a<br>
champion and the disciplines of the Christian life.  Mature youth have<br>
appreciated his testimony; unfortunately, others feel talking about discipline<br>
and self-denial is a drag.  Since hanging up his rifles, my friend has<br>
switched from being a medal winner to being a soul winner.<br>

<i>&gt; This is not at all a simple issue.</i><br>
<p>
Not at all.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Take a medic who repairs combat troops. Those troops whose lives have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; saved then go back to fight some more. </i><br>
<p>
Well...<br>
<p>
Troops lightly wounded enough to be sent back into fighting soon often<br>
don't need the medic much at all.<br>
<p>
The ones that really need the medic's services are more likely to<br>
be people who won't be coming back for quite a while, if at all.<br>
<p>
People who would otherwise have died.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So the medic is doing just as much to aid the killing as "the</i><br>
<i>&gt; clerk who types the order to kill" or the truck driver carting</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ammunition.</i><br>
<p>
I would disagree, at least partly: the medic isn't normally doing<br>
anything to supply the tools of war to the troops who have to do<br>
the killing. You might argue that it just frees up another man to<br>
take weapons and fight...except that it's very seldom the case that<br>
the government's resources are so constrained that they can't just<br>
conscript a few more to make up the difference.  Your choosing to<br>
not serve is unlikely to result in any fewer, or any more, troops<br>
being eventually sent into combat.<br>
<p>
Looks to me like a juggling match.  If I refuse to serve when called<br>
up, most likely I'll be put in a small room for the duration (in<br>
earlier times I'd just be shot, as happened in U.S. during the Civil<br>
War), and they'll just select another hapless sort, who, if not<br>
choosing to forego weapons training, might well turn out to be a<br>
poorer medic, being distracted with the competing urges to do his job<br>
and provide a measure of his own self defense.<br>
<p>
My choice was to try to reduce the sum total of suffering, if called<br>
up.  Most of my friends called up made the same choice, a few didn't.<br>
<p>
My father served during WW2 as a navy medical corpsman, basically taking<br>
the same choice.<br>
<p>
It's something that should be left up to the choice of the individual,<br>
and respected either way.<br>

<i>&gt; pacifistic stance.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not an etymologist (is that the right word?), but, given the denotation<br>
of pacifist, I think pacifist may not be an entirely correct characterization,<br>
even tho we may speak of the SDA church as being pacifist.  As they used to<br>
say in English class, compare &amp; contrast our stance vs Mennonites &amp; Quakers.<br>
<p>
Perhaps our stance was not brought up to you for two reasons:<br>
1) Whether or not one bears arms in private or in the military is not a<br>
test of fellowship, to the best of my knowledge.  Re the first case:<br>
for example, many pioneer missionaries needed guns to protect against<br>
marauding animals.  However, as to military service, the historical stand,<br>
in my experience, is to strongly recommend serving in a non-combatant role (the rationale has been worked out over many years).  In your case, your<br>
role was chosen before you became an SDA, so there was no need to press<br>
the issue, but leave it up to you.  Some SDAs have, I believe, bore arms<br>
during wartime.  It is my understanding that one of the main Pathfinder<br>
leaders in Yuma, Arizona, has been a gunnery training officer for the Marines<br>
(just recently retired).  I also recall Guide magazine, back in the 60s,<br>
publishing a story about an SDA youth in South America who had no choice<br>
but to bear arms, did so while praying not to have to go into combat,<br>
and how the Lord used him to protect the general's family, etc.<br>
Of course, there are also stories about those who served as non-combatants.<br>
2) Since it is a personal decision, your pastor decided to let you grow<br>
in Christian maturity and make the decision in your/God's own time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I was upset that people took</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a strong stance on it and that I had never heard about it before</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps because of the non-combatant recommendation and whereas the vast<br>
majority of SDA young men choose not to bear arms, many suffering persecution<br>
on many occasion as result, some folk may feel that those who chose<br>
otherwise betray the faith; thus they speak out strongly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is the church </i><br>
<i>&gt; really such a strong "peace" church or is the tone of the conversation</i><br>
<i>&gt; just much stronger then the actual beliefs?</i><br>
<p>
I would suggest the latter is closer, given my comments above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I feel strongly</i><br>
<i>&gt; about my rights to bear arms and have recently been shopping for firearms.</i><br>
<p>
Final comment:  When my wife and I were overseas as missionaries, there was<br>
a riot at our school, stemming in part over tribal rivalries but directed<br>
at the missionaries over alleged preferential treatment.  Several of the<br>
missionaries came very close to being killed, and there was great damage<br>
to property.  Some of the missionaries took up machetes and lead pipes.<br>
My wife and I did neither, prefering "feathers" (see Ruth 2:12, Ps 36:7;<br>
57:1; 61:4; 91:4).<br>

If any pacifists there be in the SDA church, they certainly don't go<br>
to my local church in Illinois.  One of the leading families in the church<br>
had a grandson in the Gulf war, and another had a son in the National Guard<br>
that almost got sent.  The first Sabbath during the gulf war was marked <br>
by marked and long prayers for our troops and none for the Iraqi civilians.<br>
A yellow candle was conspicuously burning on the communion table.<br>
<p>
After the Desert Storm operation was over and this soldier returned to <br>
visit the church that had written him many letters and prayed many prayers,<br>
there was quite the celebration in church, the pastor doing everything <br>
but wrapping himself in the American flag.  God help me, I felt like<br>
going on stage and burning the American flag.  (I didn't.)  <br>
<p>
The media such as the Adventist Review was not immune to cheerleading<br>
during the gulf war, either.  The Adventists in the war that were<br>
casualties<br>
got newsbreak mention, even press releases from the GC communication<br>
department.  We've still never heard what happened to the SDA church <br>
in Baghdad (there was one, I understand).  Nobody mentioned that Iraq<br>
was one of the few countries in the Gulf that allows some measure of <br>
religious freedom.<br>
<p>
People will not believe that our church recommends against combatancy<br>
if we continue to lionize the soldiers who shoot.  The Review coverage<br>
plus the four-part feature on Ronald Tull which appeared in Insight magazine <br>
tell the real story of where we stand.  Not to mention that many SDA pastors<br>
are chaplains in the National Guard and Army Reserves in addition to their <br>
regular duties.  Too often Adventism and Americanism are combined,<br>
with disastrous results to both.<br>

Having overcome the ugly picture on the front of their first album to<br>
continue on a successful tour, they are now ready to put out a second<br>
album, this one makes them look almost as good as they do in real life.<br>
Again this album is produced by Billy Smiley.  The influences from <br>
White Heart, being both their producer and touring partner, are obvious.<br>
However, there are some important differences.<br>
<p>
For those who have been hiding for the last two years, Rachel Rachel<br>
is an all-female Christian rock band, comprised of Brynn Beltran (keyboards)<br>
Cheryl Jewel (lead vocals), Jennifer Sparks (Sparky) drums, <br>
Heli Sterner (guitars+vocals) and Jennifer York (bass).  Their music<br>
is straight-up rock and roll with well-harmonized three and four part vocals.<br>
<p>
Highlights from this album are "In Your Arms" and "You Are Always There".<br>
It's well-produced, well-written (they write most of their own stuff)<br>
and well-performed.  If you liked their previous album, you'll like this <br>
one better.  If you liked anything that White Heart or early Margaret Becker<br>
has done, you'll like this, too.  Although I must say I have heard <br>
this album four times now and still none of the songs have stuck with me.<br>
<p>
Steve's rating  2.5 thistles on a scale of -5 to 5<br>

There's quite a bit of Adventist-bashing going on in bit.listserv.christia<br>
otherwise known as the CHRISTIA mailing list.  I don't normally subscribe<br>
to that list, but I picked it up in a newsreader just to follow this <br>
thread and respond to it.  Anyone who subscribes or reads that list,<br>
I can use help.  It's possible to subscribe by sending <br>
<p>
SUB CHRISTIA Yourname<br>
<p>
to LISTSERV@ASUACAD<br>
<p>
but I wouldn't unless you're a real glutton for traffic--they turn over <br>
60-100 messages a day.<br>

Being from Austin, Texas (right in the heart of the Texas Republic) our<br>
paper has followed this standoff daily. This last Sunday's paper had about<br>
75% of the first section dedicated to numerous articles about this. In<br>
fact, one page was dedicated to two articles about SDA beliefs. Quite well<br>
done, I thought.<br>
<p>
One article caught my attention regarding the weapons that Koresh has. It<br>
is legal to buy a 50m machine gun in Texas. A local gun store owner has<br>
one in his store. You do have to have a license though and approved by the<br>
BATF. It seems Koresh must have been getting his arsenal illegally. The<br>
tip off to the BATF that this arsenal existed was a UPS package that broke<br>
open upon delivery to the compound and revealed grenade casings. Seems<br>
there is an unscrupulous (sp?) weapons mail order firm in Florida under<br>
investigation.<br>

The following is a chart I put together a couple of years ago for s.r.c.<br>
And I posted it to SDAnet.  This last weekend I attended a series of<br>
meetings by Larsen.  Excellent studies from the Bible and EGW.  One of<br>
his topics was a study from the Bible and EGW on how Jesus is the<br>
perfect and complete sacrificial atonement.  Also his perfect priestly<br>
atonement.  Before the cross there was the sacrifice of lambs and the<br>
mediatorial role of the priests, preceded by the Patriarchs.  After<br>
the cross we have the perfect "lamb" slain once as well as the perfect<br>
High Priestly work of Atonement of Jesus.  The point he was making is<br>
that we can accept the Calvinist position of Jesus dying a perfect and<br>
complete sacrificial death of Atonement, replacing the death of lambs<br>
slain from the foundation of the world.  But we also believe in the<br>
perfect work of priestly atonement that Jesus serves in the heavenly<br>
temple built without human hands.  While Jesus death was a perfect<br>
and complete work of sacrificial atonement, we also believe in His work<br>
of priestly Atonement which replaces that of the Old Covenent priests.<br>
<p>
So, I came home and fired up my MAC and researched the texts to incorporate<br>
into my chart.  So, here is an update:<br>

I have heard much discussion about Desmond Ford since joining the church<br>
but have never been able to read anything written by him to make a <br>
personal informed desision about his ideas.  I have always felt it wrong<br>
to judge a persons ideas when taken 4th or 5th hand.  Does anyone<br>
out there know how I can get some information or books written by him<br>
or maybe an adress for his organization.        <br>
<p>
I have heard what Ron Spears and Colin Standish say about his beliefs<br>
but feel that may not be the whole story.<br>
<p>
Thanks in advance<br>
<p>

I'm sure that research has been done on the relationship of the SDA<br>
church and the military.  In the U.S. this history goes back to the<br>
Civil War, when church authorities tried to prevent Adventist young men<br>
from being drafted.  I don't remember, but this may have had to do as<br>
much with Sabbath problems than it did with a real pacifist belief.<br>
Most Adventists, including Ellen White, had been real abolitionists<br>
(to the point that Ellen White said that the Civil War was a punishment<br>
to the North for having tolerated slavery for so long).  These were New<br>
England reformers after all.  While SDAs have never been as strictly<br>
pacifist as the Amish (many of whom live not far from here in Northern<br>
Indiana), there certainly is a long history of at least a modified<br>
version of it.  To deny this or try to cover it up is not a credit to<br>
our history.  I believe Seminary professor George Knight recently gave a<br>
paper on this topic at a conference at Goshen (Ind.) College.<br>
<p>
By the time of World War II (the war of my father's generation), the<br>
church had made an accomodation with the military/government complex in<br>
the form of serving as I-AO (non-combatants in the military),<br>
particularly as medics.  This was promoted by the Medical Cadet Corps,<br>
which was an organization where old and young Adventists could play at<br>
being soldiers and also learn something about what lay ahead of them (at<br>
least the young men).  I believe this organization lasted into the late<br>
'60s or early '70s.  The '60s generation was not prepared for this type<br>
of lockstep approach, and it was really at that time that I believe the<br>
church really began to support the concept of supporting individual<br>
choice.  For some, this meant becoming true conscientious objectors and<br>
doing alternate service.  If I had been older or had a lower lottery<br>
number, that is the route that I would have taken.  But it also opened<br>
the door wider for SDAs to take combatant roles.<br>
<p>
This became much more widespread after the reinstitution of the<br>
volunteer army after Vietnam.  Economic incentives may have played a<br>
part in some of these individuals' decision to enlist.  Many no doubt<br>
experiences Sabbath problems.  I am one of Maxwell's reprobates who<br>
writes for Spectrum (though Mervyn and I get along just fine on a<br>
personal basis), and in my survey of SDA colleges newspapers at the time<br>
of the Gulf War, I found the same thing as Steve did--far more overt<br>
support for the war and the warriors than one would expect, given the<br>
church's historic position.  On the campus here at Andrews there was a<br>
fascinating response from many of the foreign students (who in the past<br>
have been shocked by the patriotic activities and "showing the flag"<br>
during Pathfinder Sabbath).  These students were truly shocked that the<br>
American church was taking such a pro-military stand (and Pioneer<br>
Memorial Church also glorified its heroes).  Some, like the Germans,<br>
knew that historically their church had been split over this issue (and<br>
the Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement begun).  Given their history,<br>
it was not surprising that the Germans were pacifistic, but many other<br>
nationalities supported this, indicating to me that this is something<br>
that our missionaries had probably originally taken to these lands as<br>
part of our beliefs and practices.<br>
<p>
In this country, I wonder how much this pro-military stance is related<br>
to the drift toward fundamentalism found in some segments of the church.<br>
A few years ago I was in Huntsville for the 4th of July and went to a<br>
performace at a Baptist Church--a patriotic extravaganza including<br>
fireworks--in the church!  I don't know of any Adventist churches that<br>
would do this (though a local black SDA church participated in the<br>
Baptist performance), but I'm sure there are many sympathizers.  In<br>
North America, we sometimes forget that we are a minority in a world<br>
church, and that Adventism and America are not the same.  Sometimes I<br>
wonder if our practice has as much to do with avoiding Sabbath problems<br>
in the military as it does with actual belief that serving in the<br>
military is wrong, in much the same way as it is easier to be an<br>
Adventist in the medical professions (where almost by definition there<br>
are no Sabbath problems) than in other professions.  I would like to<br>
think that Adventists are less violent than the general public, and I<br>
suspect that far fewer of us own guns than do our neighbors.  If for<br>
nothing else, this would distance us from such kooks as Koresh.<br>

I have followed with some interest the "American" discussion about non-combatancy<br>
I am also a little surprised - for me adventism has always meant not bearing <br>
guns (well maybe hunting). When I made my military service in the<br>
60's (in Finland), I applied for a service not wearing guns. That was granted<br>
very easily - the service time was some 13 moths instead for normal 8. I <br>
counted that as a sacrifice for my beliefs. I declared that I will not do any service<br>
service on Sabbaths either and that was also granted; provided that i dissappeared<br>
from the garrisons during Saturdays.<br>
<p>
In my unit with som 800 men there was  som 20 who were conscientius; SDAs, Baptists<br>
Pentecostals etc. Today here in Finland altogether some 6000 men decline<br>
to go to military service, mainly because of ethical reasons (or as some militar<br>
people think because of comfort).<br>
<p>
Wel we have to accept that the Adventist culture is different in different parts<br>
of the world (Here in Finland we go swimming on Sabbath! 8-) )<br>

I heard Donahue had a show dedicated to the Branch Davidians business.  I<br>
gather there were former members of the group there and one was supposedly<br>
a former SDA member.  I heard our church didn't come out very well.  Does<br>
anyone know more about this? <br>

In the ongoing discussions on the CHRISTIA list, Ruben Gonzalez<br>
(who has been a big help on our side) has brought up the point that<br>
what SDA's say about the Catholic church is no different than what<br>
the various reformers have said, and brought out a various list<br>
of reformers who referred to the pope as Antichrist, including Luther,<br>
Wesley, and others.  <br>
<p>
I have heard this many times, but don't know where to find the reference<br>
on such.  Can anyone help?<br>

Having been brought up in the flatlands of Michigan, where we were brought<br>
up to learn that wearing a wedding band was a Sin Against the LORD,<br>
and ran several people out of church for that reason, I was deprived of <br>
the Sabbath School lesson that tells one how to wear a wedding ring.<br>
I find myself rather lost interpreting the present situation, because<br>
I never learned how and where a wedding ring was supposed to be worn.<br>
Not that I plan to wear one myself anytime soon, but since I went <br>
through the SDA colonies while the "watch code" was still sort of in effect,<br>
I need to interpret the new "ring" code.<br>
<p>
Which hand is a wedding ring supposed to be worn on?  What about these <br>
people who have an extra ring with some translucent rock attached?<br>
What about people who have rings on all their fingers--what does that mean?<br>
And why does the ring seem to be declining in culture at large as a symbol <br>
of marriage just as it is making its ascendancy in SDA-land?  Is <br>
this another example of the older generation permitting what they were not<br>
allowed as young people?  Or is it the case, like jazz music, where<br>
the cultural connotations are different now than when it first came out<br>
so now it can be permitted?<br>

As is often the case, people attacking the SDA church in discussions focus on<br>
the don'ts of Adventism.  Particularly one attacker has raised the subject<br>
of unclean meats.  This is something I don't have a good answer for.  <br>
The Adventist view on clean and unclean meats points back to Genesis 7<br>
to show that the regulations of clean and unclean were known to Noah and <br>
thus predate Sinai.  But in Genesis 9, where God gives Noah instruction<br>
in diet, we read in vs 3, 4  "Every moving thing that is alive shall <br>
be food for you;  I give all to you, as I gave the green plant.<br>
Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood."<br>
<p>
In light of this, how is our doctrine defensible.  I'm not trying to tear<br>
down our doctrine, I want to know the answer.<br>

    I'm sure that research has been done on the relationship of the SDA<br>
    church and the military...  <br>
<p>
I recently joined this net so have not seen the earlier messages in<br>
this thread, but ...<br>
<p>
Ron Lawson, an SDA sociologist at Queens College, NYC, has done<br>
research on SDA and its relationship to the military (both official<br>
and practice).  He is "chaplain" of our Assoc of Adv Forum chapter in<br>
Greater NY (meets weekly on the campus of Columbia University,<br>
Manhattan, St Paul's Chapel, Sat 10:00-12:00).  Ron has done a lot of<br>
sociological work on the SDA church around the world and is working on<br>
a book about the church.  He has interviewed officials from every<br>
division and every union in the world and many local conferences,<br>
missions and other institutions over the last several years.<br>
<p>
In a recent meeting Ron described some of his work on SDAs and<br>
military and we had a response from Elder Tull (I believe that is the<br>
right spelling, he was Ministerial Secr of NJ Conf but has since taken<br>
a Pastorship in Paradise Valley, CA).  Elder Tull's son was the sole<br>
survivor of an attach on his Marine tank during Desert Storm and he<br>
talked about his attitudes concerning his son's service (he supported<br>
his son and saw God's protection in his survival).<br>
<p>
Ron's findings were very interesting.  The US history is reasonably<br>
well known but he has collected a lot of data on the relationship in<br>
other parts of the world -- which has varied enormously.  Ron recently<br>
published his work but I do not have the reference.  I could get the<br>
citation if this would be of interest to the group.<br>
<p>
The non-combatant option is nearly unique to the US.  Elsewhere, the<br>
variation runs from cases in which nearly every Adventist serves <br>
as combatants to countries where the Church insists on conscientious<br>
objection and nearly every Adventist (at least male) serves time in<br>
prison for it.  Sometimes the position changes very quickly such as in<br>
Korea, where until recently many SDAs served time in prison for<br>
refusing to serve and then, in a very abrupt reversal, we now provide<br>
military training with weapons on the campus of our college (we would<br>
have lost government approval of the college if we refused to provide<br>
training).<br>
<p>
It seems that our position has often had less to do with any<br>
principles and more to do with public acceptance/image and the<br>
advantages vs disadvantages of government cooperation.  As the church<br>
(in many countries) has become more mainstream, there has developed a<br>
pressure to perserve (or create) a positive image and acceptance by<br>
the public.  Where cooperation with the government has brought better<br>
acceptance and sometimes other accommodations and where there has not<br>
been a firm position based on universally accepted principles we seem<br>
to have moved toward cooperation (on this as well as other issues).  <br>
<p>
Since I do not look to my church to determine my position for me, such<br>
changes don't bother me deeply, but I feel badly for others who have<br>
felt compelled to pay a high personal price (prison, ...) for<br>
maintaining the church's position and then have that abruptly change.<br>

I saw part of the episode yesterday (3/11), and unfortunately, I was<br>
saddened by the former member of our SDA church.  He attended LLU as a<br>
religion major hoping to become a minister.  However, because he is<br>
blind, the hierarchy (at LLU?) told him that he would NOT be an effective<br>
minister, so he left the church.  Anyway, he was recruited by Koresh's<br>
father-in-law (if I recall correctly), and joined them for a while.  He<br>
has since left the BD's and is living in Australia.<br>
<p>
If anyone else has any information, or a videotape or transcript of that<br>
Donahue show, I would greatly appreciate it.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I was reading in Joe Crews book, "Answers to difficult bible texts."  The<br>
title is something like that, I cannot remember exactly.  He    answers<br>
this by keying in on the phrase ""as I gave the green plant."  He says<br>
that there are poisonus plants that God did not give to man so when God<br>
said I give you the green plant, He was talking about the "good" green<br>
plants, or those plants that were good for food.  Then the corelation is made<br>
to meats.  I beleive he talked about roaches and rats and how God does not<br>
want us to eat these things because they are detrimental.<br>
<p>
It all depends on your view of our keeping the health laws.  Are we doing<br>
it to be healthy, or are we doing it to follow some law.  Some say we are<br>
doing it to be healthy and yet we eat many things that are detrimental to<br>
our body.  Really to not eat unclean meats should of necessity cause us to <br>
eat correctly, because our reason is to be healthy.  Therefore, we should<br>
be exercizing, if we are refraining from unclean meats to be healthy.<br>
<p>
If we are refraining from unclean meats just to follow a law, we do not<br>
need to worry about such things as exercizing or eating healthier.  If<br>
we do this, however, I believe we miss the whole idea of the Health <br>
Message.<br>

Regarding eating any moving thing right after the flood.<br>
<p>
  * Vegetarian seems to be all thats promoted before the flood.<br>
<p>
  * Right after the flood, with a totally baren landscape, there<br>
    would be little to eat.<br>
<p>
  * God said meats were made available to shorten their lifespans.<br>
<p>
  * After that we see the unclean meats clearly defined.<br>
<p>
So, at best the Noah and flood argument applys to the desert island<br>
scenario where starvation is the other alternative.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, the Bible stories of God providing.  And of course<br>
Daniel and his friends did so much better without the kings food.<br>
Was the king serving pork?  Of course we cannot say for sure.  Was<br>
it simply rich sweet/fat vege foods?  Again, we cannot say for sure.<br>
But I think its very likely that foods forbidden to Israelites was<br>
the issue and so very probably unclean meats.  So Daniel and his<br>
friends resorted to a vegetarian diet and did incredibly well compared<br>
to those eating what the king ate.<br>

<i>&gt;In the ongoing discussions on the CHRISTIA list, Ruben Gonzalez</i><br>
<i>&gt;(who has been a big help on our side) has brought up the point that</i><br>
<i>&gt;what SDA's say about the Catholic church is no different than what</i><br>
<i>&gt;the various reformers have said, and brought out a various list</i><br>
<i>&gt;of reformers who referred to the pope as Antichrist, including Luther,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Wesley, and others.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have heard this many times, but don't know where to find the reference</i><br>
<i>&gt;on such.  Can anyone help?</i><br>
<p>
Well, i don't know if this is of help, but E G White quotes quite a few of<br>
the reformers in "The Great Controversy" and you can use the index or the<br>
CD ROM to look up where she quotes them. Some editions of the GC also<br>
give the reference from where she took it.<br>
<p>
	Other interesting stuff about what the reformers said about papists<br>
can be found in "Daniel &amp; Revelation" by Uriah Smith, SDA bible commentary<br>
vol 7 (front articles) and in vol.9 - the bible student's source book(look<br>
under "heretics", "antichrist", "reformation", "luther" etc.).<br>
<p>
	The translators of the 1611 English Bible refer to the pope as "that<br>
man of sin" and speak of "popish persons" who want to keep the populace "in<br>
darkness" from the bible (see their forward at the front of the KJV).<br>
<p>
	Speaking of antichrist, i have a book by catholics which contains<br>
some of their prophecies by various catholic prophets and from the bible.<br>
Some of it is pretty far out, one which caught my eye was a prophecy about<br>
antichrist by one Dionysius of Luxemberg (died 1682) who said that, among<br>
other things, the antichrist will teach the world that "Saturday is to be<br>
observed instead of Sunday, and he will change the 10 commandments."<br>
<p>
	I don't know how it goes in Christia but i would like to caution<br>
against getting into hot debate with catholics or their allies. Says Mrs.<br>
White:<br>
	"We should not, upon entering a place, build up unnecessary barriers<br>
between us and other denominations, especially the Catholics, so that they<br>
shall think we are their avowed enemies. We should not create a prejudice in<br>
their minds unnecessarily, by making a raid upon them..."<br>
	"There should be no going out of the way to attack other<br>
denominations; for it only creates a combative spirit and closes ears and<br>
hearts to the entrance of the truth. We have our work to do which is not to<br>
tear down but to build up. We are to repair the breech that has been made in<br>
the law of God. It is the nobler work to build up, to present the truth in<br>
its force and power and let it cut its way through prejudice and reveal<br>
error in contrast with truth. There is a danger that our ministers will say<br>
too much against the Catholics and provoke against themselves the strongest<br>
prejudices of that church. There are many souls in the Roman Catholic faith<br>
who are looking with interest to this people;..."<br>
	"Let not those who write for our papers make unkind thrusts and<br>
allusions that will certainly do harm, and that will hedge up the way and<br>
hinder us from doing the work that we should do in order to reach all<br>
classes, the Catholics included. It is our work to speak the truth in love,<br>
and not to mix in with the truth the unsanctified elements of the natural<br>
heart, and speak things that savor of the same spirit possesed by our<br>
enemies. All sharp thrusts will come back upon us in double measure.....<br>
Over and over the message has been given to me that we are not to say one<br>
word, not to publish one sentence, especially by way of personalities,<br>
unless positively essential in vindicating the truth, that will stir up our<br>
enemies against us, and arouse their passions to a white heat..."<br>
<p>

debates, see "Evangelism" pgs 573-577, 162-167)<br>

In the U.S., the wedding ring is usually worn on the fourth finger of<br>
the left hand.  [That's where I wore mine until I lost it in the garden<br>
about a year ago.  I still hope to find it before we move to a new house<br>
later this year.]  Many, if not most, Europeans wear theirs on the fouth<br>
finger of the right hand (and don't understand why Americans use the<br>
left--or gauche/sinister--hand for this--sorry southpaws!).  Some<br>
people, mostly female, also wear an engagement ring (usually with a<br>
stone).  I believe in the past that the custom in some areas was for the<br>
wife to wear a wedding ring but not the husband.  This may have grown<br>
out of the concept of the wedding ring as a token of ownership.  In<br>
recent years I think there has been a growing trend for both husband and<br>
wife to wear wedding rings.<br>
<p>
I don't know where Steve's statistics come from about the incidence of<br>
wedding ring wearing.  Many of our married students at Andrews (and most<br>
of the European ones) wear wedding rings.  When I meet people<br>
professionally, they are often wearing a wedding ring (including the<br>
men).  There are lots of cultural differences in the world at large, in<br>
the church at large, and in the church in North America on this.  I have<br>
heard that there are still churches where this is a no-no.  Yet others<br>
feel very strongly about its symbolism.  I remember when I was in<br>
library school at Chapel Hill just before I came up here, I put my ring<br>
away (figuring it would not be the thing to do).  It was surprising how<br>
many people noticed and concluded that Coral and I had split up.  We<br>
need to be tolerant of other people's convictions.<br>

     I heard on the radio yesterday that there will be elections in<br>
Australia this Saturday.  Not only that, but voting is manditory<br>
($20 fine if you don't vote).  What do you think about voting on<br>
Sabbath?  Also, perhaps someone down under could tell us whether<br>
or not there is ample opportunity to do your voting during non-Sabbath<br>
hours?<br>

<i>&gt;I have followed with some interest the "American" discussion about</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-combatancy I am also a little surprised - for me adventism has always</i><br>
<i>&gt;meant not bearing guns (well maybe hunting).</i><br>
<p>
Yes i am a bit surprised too. The national media here sometimes publishes<br>
views that the west, and especially America, is decadent, unruly, and given<br>
to much crime, violence, drugs and moral peversion, and therefore urge<br>
this as a warning against copying all the values and customs of the west,<br>
like human rights and so on. Of course, i know that views of this sort are<br>
biased, hypocritical, and usually politically motivated; but (and no offense<br>
meant to anyone) from all the _bad_ news, America does appear to be a violent<br>
war-like society, with people getting shot at for sounding a car horn and<br>
all that, although i still think and hope that violence there is localised<br>
and still rather the exception than the rule. Of course, there is more<br>
violence all over the world nowadays, Singapore is no exception, but somehow,<br>
i always expected, at the back of my mind, that America was founded by<br>
Christian people, on Christian principles, and so would be more peaceful<br>
and civilised than some other places, although i probably saw that this was<br>
not the case.<br>
	Well, America has been styled the policeman of the new world order,<br>
since it is the only superpower left, and nowadays, policemen need guns i<br>
suppose. Still, imagine what it will be like when the lamb-like beast<br>
speaks like the dragon.<br>
	And serving with guns, it is seldom a black-and-white clear cut<br>
issue, i suppose, and has to do a lot with individual beliefs, after all<br>
each must live with their own conscience. That it is not a test of<br>
fellowship in the SDA church shows, i suppose, that it is not a hard and<br>
fast rule everywhere and there is considerable variance in views about<br>
bearing arms in the armed services. And in actual combat, it gets even harder,<br>
because the situation is so extreme and so unnatural that many moral issues<br>
become hard to decide. Is there such a thing as a "just" war?  Or is it just<br>
a war. What does it justify? Does the ends justify the means?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When I made my military service</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the 60's (in Finland), I applied for a service not wearing guns. That</i><br>
<i>&gt;was granted very easily - the service time was some 13 moths instead for</i><br>
<i>&gt;normal 8. I counted that as a sacrifice for my beliefs.</i><br>
<p>
Here, the length of service varies according to educational qualifications.<br>
The higher qualified people serve 2 1/2 years and the others 2 years. I just<br>
finished my full-time servie in June last year and am now a reservist, a<br>
part-time soldier, till i'm 40 years old.<br>
	Well, it must have meant quite a lot to you to have to serve 1 1/2<br>
times as long as other people because of your beliefs. Here we are quite<br>
fortunate in that there is no official penalty for SDAs who choose not to<br>
bear weapons and not to work on Sabbath, although we sometimes still get<br>
Sabbath problems and harrassment of various sorts from some superiors. In<br>
the early days in the 60s, it was a lot worse for SDAs, who were subjected<br>
to detention and other punishments because of Sabbath and bearing arms.<br>
	In some other countries, Korea for example, not bearing arms means<br>
a lengthy jail term or other penalties. I heard that in the US up until<br>
world war 1, some of them were even execuited because of this.<br>
	Presently in Singapore, there is relative tolerance of SDA practices<br>
in the armed forces. Interestingly it is the Jehovah's Witnesses, who are<br>
banned in Singapore and considered a subversive cult, that are imprisoned.<br>
	I quite admire their faith and determination in willing to undergo<br>
that. Well, they believe in totally not doing National Service at all and<br>
refuse to take the oath of allegiance to the Republic or the Armed Forces<br>
and so end up in detention barracks for 3 years i think. But i understand<br>
that they are considered prisoners of conscience and kept appart from the<br>
other inmates and treated relatively humanely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I declared that I will not do any service service on Sabbaths either and</i><br>
<i>&gt;that was also granted; provided that i dissappeared from the garrisons</i><br>
<i>&gt;during Saturdays.</i><br>
<p>
Wow! i wish they had such a proviso here! My superiors were kind enough to<br>
let me _not_ stay in camp on most Saturdays and so i could attend church<br>
almost every week. My friend who is still serving NS is not so fortunate.<br>
He never comes to church nowadays because he is not allowed out on Sabbath,<br>
although he is excused from working on that day.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In my unit with som 800 men there was some 20 who were conscientius; SDAs,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Baptists Pentecostals etc. Today here in Finland altogether some 6000 men</i><br>
<i>&gt;decline to go to military service, mainly because of ethical reasons</i><br>
<i>&gt;(or as some militar people think because of comfort).</i><br>
<p>
Well, in my unit there were 2 other SDAs (i can't tell you how many men<br>
were in my unit because that would be considered a breach of security).<br>
As far as i know, SDAs are the only conscientious objectors serving here.<br>
Here, no one is allowed to decline millitary service. We have to produce<br>
a letter from the church to certify that we are practising SDAs (there<br>
is a list of definitions such as non-smoking, tithe paying etc.) before<br>
they will make provisions for us to serve without weapons etc, to reduce<br>
the chance of people using religion as an excuse to avoid combat vocations<br>
or work on Saturdays. Anyway, when i enlisted, i didn't want to avoid<br>
National Service at all, and was actually quite enthusiastic about it,<br>
but when i got in, it wasn't much like what i expected.<br>
	Well, perhaps i'll write about the time i was threatened with a<br>
court-marshall because i refused to do a physical fitness test on Sabbath.<br>
Somebody on SDAnet asked me to tell about it to encourage people with<br>
Sabbath problems, and all this talk about the army reminded me of it.<br>
Well, that will be another story.<br>
	<br>
<i>&gt;Wel we have to accept that the Adventist culture is different in different</i><br>
<i>&gt;parts of the world (Here in Finland we go swimming on Sabbath! 8-) )</i><br>
<p>
And i hear that in India, they play drums for worship service music! And<br>
my local church doesn't allow any flesh food, even "clean meat" on the<br>
premises! And somebody told me that some tribes people in a remote part of<br>
the world, go to church practically naked! Yes, culture does vary a lot.<br>
What is considered proper in one culture might not be viewed as such in<br>
another, but God understands all cultures and all languages so i don't<br>
suppose He minds it.<br>

It seems like the world's questioning eye is focusing<br>
more intensely on religion...<br>
<p>
"Should 'religion' remain a part off federal civil rights?"<br>
I've been asked this pointed question, and would like<br>
to hear some responses.  Actually I need help.<br>
The argument is quite cutting because one's "religion"<br>
per se, is not like race, or gender.  We who are "born"<br>
into families which practice certain beliefs, "choose"<br>
our religion.<br>
<p>
Also, it is pointed out that religious groups have<br>
extra-ordinary financial recourses, and political clout.<br>
Thus, they should be considered as non-minority, and<br>
should not receive the same protection.<br>
<p>
Any comments would be appreciated.<br>

If you have access to them, the many volumes of Merle D'Aubigne's _History<br>
of the Reformation_ (I think there is more than one set similarly titled)<br>
is sure to provide a plethora of quotes about the reformers' views of the<br>
Roman Catholic Church.<br>

I just got this report of the fire at the Frederick, MD church which<br>
Carlos Medley mentioned on Sunday.<br>
<p>
The fire at the Fredrick church caused an estimated $3,000,000 damage.<br>
The cause is unknown. The newer school building was not significantly<br>
damaged. The sanctuary and SS classrooms were a total loss.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
I would appreciate it if some of you folks would answer these questions.  I<br>
am formulating a sermon on the topic "The Relevance of Prophecy" and would <br>
like to gauge the importance of prophecy to contemporary Seventh-day <br>
Adventists.<br>
<p>
Questions:<br>
<p>
  To what degree is a correct understanding of Biblical prophecy important to<br>
  your daily experience as a Seventh-day Adventist Christian? <br>
<p>
  What about prophecy makes it this important?<br>
<p>
You relatively brief answers would be very much appreciated.<br>

<i>&gt;"Should 'religion' remain a part off federal civil rights?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;I've been asked this pointed question, and would like</i><br>
<i>&gt;to hear some responses.  Actually I need help.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The argument is quite cutting because one's "religion"</i><br>
<i>&gt;per se, is not like race, or gender.  We who are "born"</i><br>
<i>&gt;into families which practice certain beliefs, "choose"</i><br>
<i>&gt;our religion.</i><br>
<p>
In fact, the position of freedom of religion in law  has been gradually <br>
eroded by the Supreme court over the last couple of years.  But I was not<br>
aware that we had the protection of Civil Rights law to start with.<br>
The First Amendment rights of free exercise of religion are different from<br>
the civil rights afforded to minority groups.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, it is pointed out that religious groups have</i><br>
<i>&gt;extra-ordinary financial recourses, and political clout.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thus, they should be considered as non-minority, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;should not receive the same protection.</i><br>
<p>
Civil rights are not only to protect minorities.  Witness women, who <br>
are a majority, still needing civil protection.  What these people <br>
may be trying to suggest is "Churches are not victims of society."<br>
For that I would say that civil rights should not be limited to victims.<br>
<p>
There were enough religious killings in the early history of USA,<br>
and are still enough going on elsewhere (Bosnia) to justify protection<br>
against what might happen.<br>

I'm surprised that there hasn't been any reaction on the list yet to<br>
Maxwell's letter given the number of topics he covered.  I'll take a<br>
crack at a few of them.  In general, I believe in the legal concept of<br>
race ipsit loquiter (the thing speaks for itself).  I think it is safe<br>
to report that all seminary faculty do not share his views (although a<br>
former dean did his best to fill the seminary with this type of<br>
conservative, and they still have a hammer-lock on two of the seminary<br>
departments).  I wonder at the ethics of distributing another's<br>
correspondence without his permission (by paper or in machine-readable<br>
form).  Perhaps by the time it reached the net, it was considered to<br>
already be in the public domain (Mervyn tells me that Pilgrim's Rest<br>
published it).  Actually, he may rather enjoy the notoriety.  However, I<br>
think care should be taken to preserve privacy.  I too called Mervyn to<br>
verify its authenticity (although internal evidence did not suggest that<br>
it was not authentic), and he seemed somewhat surprised that it had been<br>
distributed on the net.<br>
<p>
While I disagree with him on many issues, and agree on a few, I think<br>
some larger issues are raised, most importantly the same question that<br>
currently faces the Republican Party (similarly being held hostage by<br>
conservatives):  How large is the tent?  Like Mervyn, many old time GOPers<br>
don't recognize the party of the 1992 convention.  Our Anabaptist<br>
friends in Northern Indiana and elsewhere ask the same question:  Where<br>
should the fences be?  At the excellent Menno-Hof visitor's center in<br>
Shipsewana, IN, there is a slide presentation with this very theme<br>
discussing beliefs and practices of Amish, Hutterite and Mennonite.  All<br>
three answer the question somewhat differently.  Apparently, Maxwell<br>
wants a small tent/close fences.  In fact, fellow travelers have found<br>
it so distasteful to meet and fellowship with the "liberal" academic<br>
religion scholars in the professional society Andrews Society of<br>
Religious Studies (for many years the SDA professional society in<br>
religion) that they formed their own Adventist Theological Society,<br>
underwritten generously by outside funding.  They have a separate<br>
meeting from ASRS, but often in a nearby location and at the same time.<br>
This last fall, ATS even declined to have a joint church service with<br>
ASRS in a Seventh-day Adventist church in San Francisco.  Little wonder<br>
that some fear schism.<br>
<p>
Maxwell's call appears to be a demand that the church give in to the<br>
conservatives because some of them have always believed that way and<br>
because they are loyal and tithe-paying.  I expect that many others who<br>
do not agree with them also fit these categories.  It is interesting<br>
that in the book "Issues," which the church published to explain its<br>
position about these ministries, the church made a strong plea for<br>
toleration.  I was surprised and pleased.  I do not believe the church<br>
has "defrocked" anyone except in the most extreme circumstances.  If<br>
anything, they have bent over backwards to be tolerant, especially<br>
toward the conservatives.  Maxwell would like to equate Spectrum with<br>
Our Firm Foundation.  As a regular contributor to Spectrum, I find his<br>
views extreme.  ATS and its allies would like to define their beliefs as<br>
being mainstream/orthodox, and define everyone else as unorthodox<br>
(certainly including those wicked people at Spectrum).  Maxwell has<br>
studied enough denominational history to know that the church has<br>
changed many of its positions over time (including the trinity,<br>
rejection of the shut door, etc.).  He is right that the church changed<br>
emphasis in the 1950's--away from perfectionism and toward a more<br>
orthodox view of salvation by grace.  It is debatable that this change<br>
was a bad one (attacks on "Questions on Doctrine" and charges of "new<br>
theology").  What ever happened to the concept of "Present Truth"?  Even<br>
though my aesthetic sensibilites are offended by Celebration-type<br>
worship I don't think a judgmental attitude (they're unconverted) is at<br>
all helpful.<br>
<p>
This whole current discussion (including the NAD response) raises the<br>
issue of the role of a free press in the SDA church.  I do think that<br>
it's important to have some sources of information that are not<br>
controlled by church entities (perhaps this list serves some of that<br>
purpose?).  However, it also raises the problems of divisiveness and<br>
spreading of incorrect information (which is not impossible in the<br>
"official" press).  In any case, we need to read critically.  Many in<br>
the church have difficulty doing this.  <br>
<p>
As president of a local club, I know some of the problems in running a<br>
voluntary organization.  It's simply not always possible to get<br>
consensus.  We have members who are mad that we have our orchid show at<br>
a nuclear plant.  One won't come to the show, another quit the club<br>
entirely.  You can't please everyone all the time.  It's best to<br>
emphasize what we have in common rather than our differences.  At least<br>
in the Anglo church in North America, we have a multi-polar situation.<br>
It isn't simply conservatives vs. liberals.  As I noted above, I<br>
strongly agree with Maxwell on some issues and just as strongly disagree<br>
on others.  Another person would agree or disagree on other issues.  <br>

 From what I have read the verse actually is not speaking of all animals<br>
there,b ut at the same time it did not seem to be making the usual<br>
clean/unclean distinction.  I believe some one at Andrews is is writing<br>
there dissertation on the whole food buisness.  SaAA preview of this was<br>
in G. Hasel's article in the Adventist Theological Society publication a<br>
while back.  I don't have a copy and never got a chance to really read it.<br>
 Maybe some one knows where to find a copy of this and provide more<br>
information.  Ian Brown. <br>

Steve,<br>
<p>
Here is a reference I found where Luther explicitly singles out the papacy as<br>
being the Antichrist.  I have not had time to look for similar quotes from <br>
other reformers.  There really is a voluminous quantity of literature <br>
concerning the reformation.  There is a fair amount available at the library <br>
here at Purdue; and Purdue is certainly not a theology school!<br>
<p>
Tim Swensen<br>

----------------------<br>
<p>
In the introduction to the volume cited below, it is explained that Luther<br>
was excommunicated in 1520.  Specifically, a bull was issued by a commission<br>
including Eck and Cajetan on June 15, 1520, "condemning 41 specific errors <br>
ascribed to Luther."  It was entitled "Exsurge Domine" ("Arise, O Lord") and it<br>
"demanded that he retract his heresies within sixty days after publication of <br>
the bull in Germany on pain of excommunication, and warned all Christians to<br>
reject these heresies and burn Luther's books."  In response, Luther burned<br>
"a number of books which supported papal supremacy, including a copy of the<br>
canon law.  Finally, as though acting on a sudden impulse, he tossed into the <br>
fire a copy of the bull, 'Exsurge Domine.'  Soon thereafter he published in <br>
German his pamphlet 'Why the Books of the Pope and His Disciples Were Burned.'"<br>
<p>
<p>
The following is excerpted from "Why the Books of the Pope and His Disciples<br>
Were Burned," taken from Volume 31 of "Luther's Works"; Helmut T. Lehmann, <br>
general editor, Harold J. Grimm, editor of this volume, Lewis W. Spitz, <br>
translator of the section quoted below; copyright 1957 by Muhlenberg <br>
Press, Philadelphia.<br>
<p>
********************************<br>
<p>
{In italics, denoting a claim which Luther will respond to:}<br>
<p>
The pope does not derive authentic existence, strength, and dignity from<br>
Scripture, but Scripture from him, which is one of the main articles.<br>
<p>
{Luther's response:}<br>
<p>
Therefore, as a true Antichrist he deserves to have Christ from heaven itself <br>
destroy him together with his government, as Paul predicted [II Thess. 1:7-10].<br>
<p>
These and similar articles which are without number -- all of them aim at <br>
exalting the pope above God and man.  Everyone, even God and the angels, is <br>
subject to him, while he is subject to no one, so that even his disciples say<br>
he is an extraordinary creature, being neither God nor man (perhaps the devil<br>
himself).  So now the saying of Paul is fulfilled, "the man of lawlessness is<br>
revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself against every<br>
so-called god or object of worship ... by the activity of Satan," and son on<br>
[II Thess, 2:3-12].  When he calls him a man of lawlessness and a son of <br>
perdition, he does not mean his person alone, for that would cause little <br>
damage, but rather that his government is nothing else than sin and perdition <br>
and he will rule only to lead all the world to sin and hell.  It can readily be<br>
observed, then, and is clear from such articles that nothing except sin and <br>
perdition have come into the world through the pope, and more keeps coming<br>
daily.<br>
<p>
Those very men who observe canon law, although in out-of-the-way places, have<br>
confessed that it smells of nothing but greed and power.  That is true indeed,<br>
and whoever does not want to lie must admit it.  For if you want to know in a <br>
few words what the canon law contains, then listen.  It is, to put it briefly,<br>
the following:<br>
<p>
The pope is a god on earth over everything heavenly, earthly, spiritual, and <br>
secular, and all is his own.  No one is permitted to say to him:  "What are<br>
you doing?"<br>
<p>
That is the abomination and stench of which Christ speaks in Matt. 24 [:15]<br>
<p>
...<br>
<p>
Now the fact that no one or few people have been permitted to speak out to the<br>
pope about his abomination is not amazing, for it has been announced that he <br>
will have all those burned who oppose him and that he will have the consent of <br>
all the kings and princes.  If the seduction of the Antichrist were so gross <br>
that everyone could notice it, or so trifling that the kings and big-wigs would <br>
not be most distinguished men in, then the prophets and apostles would have <br>
cried out and written so much and so earnestly in vain.<br>
...<br>
<p>
Thus God has also blessed no city on earth with so much grace and so many <br>
saints as Rome and did more for her than for any other.  Therefore she, too, <br>
like Jerusalem, in gratitude to God, must do the greatest harm and give the<br>
world the true and most destructive Antichrist who does more harm than the<br>
good which Christ has done before.  That is the way it happens.  And it must<br>
all transpire in the name and under the pretext of Christ and of God, so that <br>
no one believes it until Christ himself comes and enlightens such darkness with<br>
the light of his advent, as St. Paul says [II Thess. 2:8; I Cor. 4:5].<br>
<p>
...<br>
<p>
Hereby I also wish to embrace all the articles as Christian and true which were<br>
damned and burned in the last bull by the nuncio of Antichrist now come from <br>
Rome and on the other hand to charge just as many articles of the pope with<br>
being antichristian and unchristian as the number of my articles which have<br>
been condemned.<br>

My interrest in Jewish Torah began when a Jew on t.r.m. objected to  one  of<br>
my  posts,  introducing  himself  as a Pharisee.  I have confirmed that many<br>
Orthodox Jews claim to be Pharisees.  Which leads to my finding that we  can<br>
learn a lot about Paul and what he has to say (Paul was a Pharisee and pupil<br>
of Gamaliel) by learning about modern Jews and what  they  find  to  be  the<br>
Torah.   Torah is a Hebrew word meaning "revelation" and is translated "law"<br>
in most Bibles.  In the Greek the word is Nomos, which is translated  "law".<br>
It  would be even clearer if you read the books.  But perhaps these selected<br>
quotes will serve to show that Torah to the Pharisee is equal to the  entire<br>
system  of  Judaism,  including  the  Law  of Moses plus the Oral law.  This<br>
system of Torah includes, for examle, over 1300 laws pertaining  to  Sabbath<br>
keeping.<br>
<p>
"This is the Torah", by Rabbi Alfred J. Kolatch:<br>
<p>
     p. 2 -- The Torah is the centerpiece of Judaism and the key  to  Jewish<br>
     survival.  Although  not every Jew is familiar with the contents of the<br>
     Torah or observes its commandments, all Jews recognize  the  centrality<br>
     of  the  Torah  in  Jewish religions life and its function as the moral<br>
     guide of the Jewish people.<br>
<p>
     p. 2 -- What made it possible for this relatively brief book [the Torah<br>
     scroll]  to  achieve such a high level of importance?  How did one book<br>
     come to be so revered that Jews in every century have been  willing  to<br>
     sacrifice  their  lives  rather than violate its teachings? p. 3 -- The<br>
     Rabbis chose to embellish the scant text and thus add  to  the  mystery<br>
     surrounding  the  event.  Rabbi Abahu, for example, notes that when the<br>
     Torah was given, the world lapsed into silence.  No one  spoke.   Total<br>
     silence.  Birds did not chirp . . . .<br>
<p>
     p. 3 -- Other Rabbis proposed that  the  Torah  was  not  intended  for<br>
     Israel  alone but was to be the property of the entire world.  Comment-<br>
     ing on Exodus 20:15, "And all the people saw  the  Voices,"  one  Rabbi<br>
     asked,  "Why  is  the  plural,  Voices,  used  in this verse when quite<br>
     clearly the reference is to the Voices of God.   The  singular,  Voice,<br>
     should have been used."<br>
<p>
     continuing p. 3 -- Rabbi Yochanan explains that we  are  to  understand<br>
     from  the  plural  usage  that the one Voice, the Voice of God, divided<br>
     itself into seven, and the seven  grew  and  expanded  and  emerged  as<br>
     seventy  Voices  so that all seventy nations of the world would receive<br>
     the message at the same time.   To  Rabbi  Yochanan  the  Torah  was  a<br>
     universal document, the heritage of all mankind.<br>
<p>
     pp. 4, 5 -- The Rabbis sought to insure that the sanctity of the  Torah<br>
     would  be  preserved.   They did so by "building a fence [seyag] around<br>
     it.  This "fence" is constructed of laws and  regulations  designed  to<br>
     preserve  the  message  of  the Torah and safeguard its teachings.  The<br>
     Rabbis also sought to encourage respectful treatment of  the  Torah  by<br>
     mandating how each scroll was to be written, and by whom, and upon what<br>
     kind of material.  They also established regulations  governing  public<br>
     readings: when the Torah should be read, how much of it should be read,<br>
     and by whom.  And they specified precisely  how  the  Torah  should  be<br>
     housed and how it should be dressed.<br>
<p>
     continuing p. 5 -- Perhaps the  greatest  factor  contributing  to  the<br>
     longevity  of  the  Torah  is the conscious effort made by great Jewish<br>
     intellectuals to prevent it from becoming obsolete  or  irrelevant,  as<br>
     has  happened  to  many  famous documents of antiquity.  In a perpetual<br>
     search for new meaning, the Torah  was  constantly  studied,  analyzed,<br>
     probed.  Every  sentence,  every  word,  every letter was dissected and<br>
     examined.  Was a word missing in a sentence?  Was a letter missing in a<br>
     word?   Was  a  word  or a phrase repeated unduly?  If so, what was the<br>
     significance of this occurrence?  Was there a hidden, deeper meaning to<br>
     the text?<br>
<p>
     According to some scholars, it was Ezra the Scribe, of the  fifth  cen-<br>
     tury B.C.E., who initiated this analytical method of Bible study.  They<br>
     base this on the statement "Ezra 7:10).   The  word  "study,"  say  the<br>
     scholars,  implies that Ezra analyzed the Torah text in order to deter-<br>
     mine what the words were intended to teach.<br>
<p>
     Scholars of the next ten centuries, through the  end  of  the  talmudic<br>
     period  (fifth  century  C.E.),  followed  in  the  footsteps  of Ezra.<br>
     Through constant examination they extracted new meaning from old  words<br>
     and learned profound lessons from episodes that had hitherto been unex-<br>
     plored.  The result was that the Torah became a 'Torat Chayim', a  liv-<br>
     ing Torah, as it has often been called.<br>
<p>
     On the golden rule, p. 13 --  In  his  commentary   Mikra  Ki-pheshuto,<br>
     Arnold Ehrlich observes that it is a serious error for anyone to assume<br>
     that the word "neighbor" refers to anyone but an Israelite.  He  argues<br>
     that  when  the  Torah says "Love your neighbor as yourself,"  it means<br>
     love only your neighbor who is like yourself -- namely, "one who is  an<br>
     Israelite, just as you are an Israelite."<br>
<p>
     p 15 -- The range of interpretation that has been given  the  Torah  by<br>
     commentators  from  earliest  talmudic times to the present is vast and<br>
     impressive.  And yet, diverse as the interpretations often may be, they<br>
     are all within the authentic tradition of Judaism.<br>
<p>
     Thus, it is evident that there are numerous  legitimate  approaches  to<br>
     achieving  an understanding and appreciation of the Torah.  The Midrash<br>
     put it very well long ago  when  it  said,  "There  are  seventy  faces<br>
     [facets]  to  the  Torah."  To which other Rabbis have added:  Whatever<br>
     any diligent student offers as an interpretation of the  Torah  may  be<br>
     considered  as  if  it,  too,  came  from  Sinai.  Professor Abraham J.<br>
     Heschel summed it up when he wrote: "Judaism is a minimum of revelation<br>
     and a maximum of interpretation.<br>
<p>
     p. 23 -- The Rabbis were puzzled that the Torah was given to the  Chil-<br>
     dren of Israel on the top of a small mountain in the midst of the wild-<br>
     erness of Sinai rather than in the Promised Land, the  future  Land  of<br>
     Israel.   They  concluded that the wilderness was purposely selected so<br>
     as to indicate that the  teachings  of  the  Torah  were  not  intended<br>
     exclusively for Israel but for the benefit of all mankind.<br>
<p>
     pp. 28,29 -- According to an early Jewish legend, before God  gave  the<br>
     Torah  to  Israel  he  offered it to many tribes so they would never be<br>
     able to say, "Had God given us the Torah, we would surely have accepted<br>
     it."<br>
<p>
     continuing p. 29 -- God approached the  Children  of  Esau  and  asked,<br>
     "Will  you  accept  the Toray?"  "What is written in it?" they queried.<br>
     "You shall not murder," God replied.  The Children of Esau  asked,  "Do<br>
     you plan to deny us the blessing bestowed upon our father Esau?  He was<br>
     blessed with the words, 'By your sword  shall  you  live.'   We  cannot<br>
     accept the Torah [because it denies us the right to commit murder]."<br>
<p>
     God then went to the Children of Lot and offered them the Torah.  "What<br>
     is  written  in  it?"   they asked.  "You shall not commit unchastity,"<br>
     God replied.  "We are descended from unchastity," they responded.   "We<br>
     cannot accept the Torah."<br>
<p>
     Then God approached the Children of Ishmael and said, "Will you  accept<br>
     the  Torah?"  "What  is  written  in  it?"  they asked.  "You shall not<br>
     steal,"  God replied.  "Will you deny us the blessing of  our  father?"<br>
     they  responded.   "Our  father  was  promised  that  'his hand will be<br>
     against every man.'  We cannot accept the Torah."<br>
<p>
     Then God came to Israel and said,  "Will you accept the Torah?"   "What<br>
     is  written  in  it?"  they asked.  God answered, "It contains 613 com-<br>
     mandments [mitzvot]."  The Children of Israel responded, "Al; that  the<br>
     Lord has commanded we shall do and obey."<br>
<p>
     p. 34 -- Kabbalists, particularly from the  sixteenth  century  onward,<br>
     were  fond of probing every word and letter of the Torah, searching for<br>
     new insights and ferreting out new meanings.  In examining verse 37  of<br>
     Exodus  12,  which states that 600,000 adult Israelites were freed from<br>
     Egypt, the kabbalists concluded that that number also  applies  to  the<br>
     number of interpretations possible for every word in the Torah.  "Every<br>
     word in the Torah has 600,000 facets,"  they said, a conclusion arrived<br>
     at  based  on  the  biblical  statement that each person present in the<br>
     Sinai wilderness (exodus 12:37) experienced the Revelation in  his  own<br>
     way.<br>
<p>
"The Jewish Book of Why", by Alfred J. Kolatch:<br>
<p>
     p 17 - Circumcision is considered more important than  any  other  com-<br>
     mandment.   The  Rabbis state in the Talmud that circumcision outweighs<br>
     all other commandments in the Tora;  consequently,  no  deviation  from<br>
     biblical law is permitted.<br>
<p>
     Reading from the prophets when reading the Torah was banned.  The "pro-<br>
     phets" were once considered secular.<br>
<p>
     The Talmud refers to a new convert as "a  child  newly  born"  (Yevamot<br>
     48b)<br>
<p>
     "Judaism in the Beginning of Christianity", by Jacob Neusner  who  says<br>
     he is a "believing Jew":<br>
<p>
     p. 42 -- The Pharisees had developed, for their part, a  peculiar  per-<br>
     ception of how to live and interpret life, which we may call an "as if"<br>
     perception.  In very specific ways the Pharisees claimed to live as  if<br>
     they were priests, as if they had to obey at home the laws that applied<br>
     to the Temple.  When the Temple itself was  destroyed,  it  turned  out<br>
     that  the  Pharisees  had  prepared  for  that tremendous change in the<br>
     sacred economy.  They continued to live as if--as if the Temple  stood,<br>
     as if there was a new Temple formed of the Jewish people.<br>
<p>
     p. 51 -- The Pharisees claimed to be authoritative because they  taught<br>
     a  philosophy  that  derived  from  Moses  at  Sinai.   They  therefore<br>
     preserved a "chain of tradition" reaching back from their  own  day  to<br>
     the  authority  of  remote  antiquity.  Their piety was centered on the<br>
     revelation of Moses.<br>
<p>
     p. 57 -- The laws that made a sect sectarian  were  those  that  either<br>
     were  interpreted and obeyed by the group in a way different from other<br>
     groups or from common society at large, on the one  hand,  or  were  to<br>
     begin  with  observed  only  by  the group, on the other. In the latter<br>
     category are the purity laws, which take so large a place in  Pharisaic<br>
     corpus.  One primary mark of Pharisaic commitment was the observance of<br>
     the laws of ritual purity outside of the Temple,  where  everyone  kept<br>
     them.  Eating one's secular, that is, unconsecrated, food in a state of<br>
     ritual purity, as if one were a Temple priest in the cult, was  one  of<br>
     the two significations of party membership.  The manifold circumstances<br>
     of every day life required the multiplication of concrete rules.<br>
<p>
      . . . . we note that the Pharisees claimed laymen are better  informed<br>
     as to purity and Temple laws than the Temple priesthood.<br>
<p>
     p. 58 -- . . . . all meals required ritual purity.  . . . .   The  set-<br>
     ting  for  observance  was  the field and the kitchen, the bed, and the<br>
     street.<br>
<p>
     p. 58, 59 -- Once the focus of piety through sanctification shifted out<br>
     of  the  Temple, a new opportunity for women opened up.  We recall that<br>
     women had gained access only to the  outer  precincts  of  the  Temple.<br>
     They  could  never approach the altar; they could not do the things men<br>
     could do.  Even if they were  members  of  the  priestly  caste,  their<br>
     standing  in  the  temple  was exactly the same as that of the lowliest<br>
     daughter of the subordinated castes, for instance, the child of a  cou-<br>
     ple  legally  not  permitted  to  marry.    But  with the emphasis upon<br>
     observing the rules of cultic cleanness,  hence  eating  food  in  holy<br>
     meals  not only in the Temple but also in the home, everything shifted.<br>
     For all of the evidence of this period takes  for  granted  that  women<br>
     prepared  meals.   Accordingly,  women  gained  a  central  role in the<br>
     correct observance of the rules governing cultic cleanliness.   Let  us<br>
     not  miss  the point:  if you keep these rules, you eat your food as if<br>
     you were a priest, so you enter the status  of  holiness.   It  follows<br>
     that  women  now enjoyed the power to secure sanctification -- and this<br>
     in the very context  from  which,  in  the  Temple  itself,  they  were<br>
     excluded.  The paradox is striking.<br>
<p>
     p. 59 -- What this meant in practice was that women could  not  prepare<br>
     meals  for their families for about a week each month.  The alternative<br>
     was that during the wife's menstrual period, the family simply ate  its<br>
     ordinary  food not in a condition of cultic cleanliness at all.  It was<br>
     no sin, but it also represented a considerable comedown.<br>
<p>
     p. 60 -- . . . . . Menstruating women therefore  had  to  take  special<br>
     care  to demarcate the places in which they walked, sat, and stood dur-<br>
     ing a week each month.<br>
<p>
     p. 61 -- . . . the stress of the Pharisee on  the  minutiae  of  cultic<br>
     law,  observed  even outside of the cult, expresses a profound yearning<br>
     for sanctification by participation in the holy and eternal life of the<br>
     Temple.<br>
<p>
"Back to The Sources", by Barry W. Holtz  [A large  book  that  meticulously<br>
details Judaism]<br>
<p>
     p. 12 -- In the Jewish tradition  statements  about  study  countlessly<br>
     multiply.   Across time and space they abound without end.  One can say<br>
     with little hesitation that Torah and its study is the  dominant  reli-<br>
     gious  preoccupation  throughout the history of Judaism, at least until<br>
     modern times, and for many even now. . . . .  The world,  according  to<br>
     the  ancient rabbis, rests on three pillars -- study, worship, and good<br>
     deeds.  And which of these is the greatest?  Study -- since from  study<br>
     the others can be deduced.<br>
<p>
     continuing p. 12 -- "Torah for the Jewish tradition is  a  multifaceted<br>
     term.  On one level it refers to the first five books of the Bible, the<br>
     content of the scroll found in any synagogue.  In another more expanded<br>
     sense, Torah is the Hebrew Bible as a whole.  But Torah stands for more<br>
     than one text or one book.  Torah is revelation, the entire  revelation<br>
     and  the  entire  activity  of Jewish study throughout the generations.<br>
     When the rabbinic sages speak of the Written Torah and the "Oral Torah"<br>
     (the  Oral Torah being the commentaries and holy texts of later genera-<br>
     tions) as both being given at Mount Sinai, they mean  to  suggest  that<br>
     all Jewish study is Torah and all Torah has the validity of revelation.<br>
     Its authority  rests  with  God,  but  its  agents  are  human  beings.<br>
     Throughout time Jews have always seen their primary occupation as being<br>
     part of this devotion to study, this ongoing revelation."<br>
<p>
     pp. 13, 14  -- Truth is given once and for all, and  it  is  laid  down<br>
     with  precision.  Fundamentally,  truth merely needs to be transmitted.<br>
     The originality of the exploring scholar has two aspects.  In his spon-<br>
     taneity,  he develops and explains that which was transmitted at Sinai,<br>
     no matter whether it was always known or whether it was  forgotten  and<br>
     had  to be rediscovered.  The effort of the seeker after truth consists<br>
     not in having new ideas but rather in subordinating himself to the con-<br>
     tinuity  of the tradition of the divine word and in laying open what he<br>
     receives from it in the context of his own time.  In other words:   Not<br>
     system  but commentary is the legitimate form throughout which truth is<br>
     approached. -- In "The Messianic Idea in Judaism (New  York:  Schocken,<br>
     1971), pp. 282-304<br>
<p>
     Continuing on page 15 -- ". . . . . Of course every interpretation that<br>
     ever  will  be  was  known  at  Sinai, was intended by God.  Isn't this<br>
     within God's power?"   "But things are probably more complex than that,<br>
     too.  .  .  . . "The rabbinic writers, however, surely approached their<br>
     task with a degree of humility uncommon to our age.  In fact,  part  of<br>
     the  purpose  of statements such as "Torah, Mishnah, Talmud and Aggadah<br>
     -- indeed even the statements some bright student will some day make to<br>
     his teacher -- were already given to Moses on Mount Sinai" (quoted from<br>
     Midrash Tanhuma by Scholem in the essay mentioned above) . . . . . . ."<br>
<p>
     p. 16 -- For the rabbis all interpretations are essentially old -- they<br>
     are  already  known  at  Sinai after all.  And yet this antiquity, this<br>
     essential "unoriginality," does not seem to limit or  hinder  the  rab-<br>
     binic  reader.  Indeed, it seems to inspire him to even greater heights<br>
     of "originality."  The antiquity of Torah is its great allure.   Rather<br>
     than  inhibit  the  interpreter  with a sense that there is nothing new<br>
     under the sun, it encourages his daring and resourcefulness.<br>
<p>
David Dictionary of the Bible, fourth revised edition, by John D. Davis:<br>
<p>
     pp. 630, 631 -- At first, when one incurred great danger in joining the<br>
     party, the Pharisees were men of strong religious character.  They were<br>
     the best people in  the  nation.   Subsequently  Pharisaism  became  an<br>
     inherited belief and the profession of it was popular, and men of char-<br>
     acter very inferior to that of the original members of the sect  joined<br>
     its ranks.  With the lapse of time also the essentially vicious element<br>
     in the system developed and laid the Pharisees, as commonly represented<br>
     by  the  members of the sect, open to scathing rebuke.  . . . . .   Yet<br>
     they always numbered in their ranks men of perfect  sincerity  and  the<br>
     highest character.<br>
<p>
     p. 703 -- In opposition to the Pharisees, who laid great stress on  the<br>
     tradition  of the elders, the Sadducees limited their creed to the doc-<br>
     trines which they found in the sacred text itself.  They held that  the<br>
     word  of  the written law was alone binding (Antiq. Xiii. 10, 6).  They<br>
     held to the letter of Scripture, even when it led to  severity  in  the<br>
     administration of justice (xx. 9, 1).<br>
<p>
Manners and Customs of the Bible, by James M. Freeman:<br>
<p>
     p. 634 -- The Pharisees were especially distinguished for  belief in an<br>
     Oral  Law  of  Moses, as well as a Written Law.  This Oral Law was sup-<br>
     posed to be supplementary to the Written Law, and,  with  various  com-<br>
     ments  added from time to time, had been handed down by tradition.  The<br>
     Pharisees had great veneration for this traditionary code, and for  the<br>
     traditionary interpretations.  They placed them in authority on a level<br>
     with the Written Law, and even above it.  See note on Matt. xv, 3.<br>

Steve,<br>
<p>
I don't have any info for you, but I'd like to say this.<br>
<p>
PLEASE don't belittle the significance of Christ's life, and principles.<br>
What I mean is this.  Limiting "Anti-CHRISTlikeness" to a single person<br>
or political/religious/social office does disservice to the significanc<br>
of what Christ exemplified in his life.  It also gets us into lots of<br>
unnecessary trouble, in name calling.  Sure, point out how the papal<br>
system is against the very foundations of Christ's character, and<br>
principles, but don't fail to give an equally passionate argument for,<br>
all other things which are "anti-CHRIST-like."<br>

There has been discussion about new covenant and law of freedom <br>
in Finnish newsgroup.  I'm not (now) asking what includes law of<br>
love, which we can find also from old testament (Deut. 6:5,...).<br>
My question is now when law was given first time and where bible<br>
tells it.  As I remember EGW has written that law (= ten commandments)<br>
was given (at least known) before Sinai.  Of course there must have been<br>
law before that as sin has existed.  Some refers to Noachdic laws or<br>
something else (which has not much place in the adventist interpretation, <br>
I suppose).<br>

Our doctrine is defensible on the basis of health.  I recognize the Levitical<br>

Two more Questions might help us put this into perspective:<br>
<p>
1.  Did this all of a sudden come up?<br>
2.  Or have the believers there known for some time?<br>
<p>
If the former (1), they should give to Caesar what's Caesar's, and <br>
celebrate their role<br>
as a stewards in this earth by voting.  Remember, this is _our_ Father's world.<br>
<p>
If the latter, then we should pose more questions.<br>
<p>
	What did the believers do?  Did they write the president, or<br>
	their political leaders to have the option of voting on another day?<br>
	If nothing, why?<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, the position of freedom of religion in law  has been gradually</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;eroded by the Supreme court over the last couple of years.  But I was not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;aware that we had the protection of Civil Rights law to start with.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;The First Amendment rights of free exercise of religion are different from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;the civil rights afforded to minority groups.</i><br>
<p>
As for civil rights protection, the civil rights laws of both the <br>
federal and state<br>
governments _do_ protect people from private acts of discrimination based<br>
upon their religious affiliation.  Section 2000a of Title 42, United <br>
States Code,<br>
prohibits discrimination in places of pubic accommodation, not only on the<br>
basis of "race, color, and national origin," but also on the basis of <br>
"religion."<br>
Section 2000e of the same title prohibits discrimination on the basis <br>
of religion<br>
as an unlawful employment practice.  The federal Fair Housing Act, in Section<br>
3602 of Title 42, United States Code, prohibits discrimination in the sale or<br>
rental of housing on the basis of religion, in addition to forbidding <br>
discrimination<br>
on the basis of race, color, sex, familial status, handicap, or <br>
national origin.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Civil rights are not only to protect minorities.  Witness women, who</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;are a majority, still needing civil protection.  What these people</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;may be trying to suggest is "Churches are not victims of society."</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;For that I would say that civil rights should not be limited to victims.</i><br>
<p>
Actually they are arguing that many religious groups are claiming victimization<br>
by society (ie. civil rights requirements, equal employment opportunity <br>
programs,<br>
liability charges based on doctrines taught, and it's effect on social <br>
structure),<br>
thus sanctioning the legislation of religion as protection for <br>
religious groups.<br>
I for one on the one hand believe, to a degree, that *some* religious groups<br>
_are_ victimized by "society", and on the other hand, other groups <br>
distort their<br>
victimization in order to misinterpret the spirit of the  First Amendment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;There were enough religious killings in the early history of USA,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;and are still enough going on elsewhere (Bosnia) to justify protection</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;against what might happen.</i><br>
<p>
I don't like killings period, but most religious killings where done by <br>
self-appointed<br>
religion police groups (ie. witch hunters, the offended by husbands who <br>
wife-kiss<br>
in public, murderers of *negro* loving Quakers, etc...).  The same ones who,<br>
themselves, fled Europe's religious police.  My understanding (and it might be<br>
wrong) is that the spirit of the law  is for no religion being sanctioned<br>
(above another) by government.  My biggest worry is knowing that somehow,<br>
my church - which I've been "born", and continually "choose" to be my church,<br>
won't be immune to the increased skepticism.<br>

<i>&gt;      I heard on the radio yesterday that there will be elections in</i><br>

<p>
As long as I can remember, elections have been on Saturdays in<br>
Australia.  There is a fine, and it's about $50, if you don't vote.<br>
<p>
There is plenty of opportunity for pre-poll voting, whether postal<br>
or in person, and one of the reasons that you can give for requiring<br>
a pre-poll vote is that of religious beliefs.<br>
<p>
Most (?)  Adventists cast pre-poll votes.  There is a pre-poll voting <br>
station every election it the Memorial Church in Cooranbong (the town <br>
that has Avondale College and the Sanitarium Health Food factory complex.)  <br>
This caters for the large number of Adventists who do not wish to vote on<br>
Sabbath.  Sometimes, depending on the time of year, the sun sets before<br>
pollig closes and Adventists vote then.<br>
<p>
Personally, I don't have any problem with voting on Sabbath - I believe<br>
that it is part of my duty to at least my fellow man, if not God.  I<br>
like to vote beforehand if possible just to save the hassle of going <br>
through the process on Sabbath.  It is usually faster to pre-poll vote <br>
(fewer people around - it took me about 30 minutes this Sabbath.)<br>

I should point out another possible source.  I am not sure how good it is,<br>
but it could be useful.  The source is Froom's Prophetic Faith of our<br>
Fathers.  It is several volumes and I think it more than just the<br>
reformers.  I know it is at the University of Iowa (actually they happen<br>
to have two sets of it) so it maybe at other public universities. <br>

Prophecy is important to me as I am a very curious and want to know what<br>
might happen next.  Also, I see a proper understanding as enchancing to<br>
faith when the events occur and it could act against possible deception<br>
(particularlly in the area of how the second coming occurs) as events come<br>
to a climax.  Of course, this is a limited view of prophecy.  If we look<br>
at EGW we see relevance in the area of enhancing our understanding of the<br>
Scriptures and reminding us of issues in the Bible we might have<br>
overlooked.  I hope this is helpful.  Ian. <br>

I've been teaching a course on the end of the world mentality this spring, so th<br>

provide me with some background on the Branch Davidians?<br>
<p>
I am in the Theology Dept. at Valparaiso University, in the field of New<br>

the leader of the cult in TX, was a Seventh-Day Adventist until i believe 1987<br>
 when he was disfellowshipped.  I heard an Adventist on CNN talking about the<br>
situation.  He was an extreme radical and basically got kicked out of the<br>
church.<br>
<p>
That is not my concern.  My concern is this.  If we are to take the bible and<br>
the spirit of Prophecy seriously, then we know that things like in Waco TX<br>
will happen to US, the ones who are standing for truth.  I do not see David K<br>
as anything other than an enemy of GOD,  God did not ask us to hoard up weapons<br>
, but it places a stigma against Adventist's as a whole.<br>
<p>
but in the future, we will be called the radical ones, accused of terrible<br>
crimes against God and man.  What will we do when we see our fellow Christians<br>
and friends acused of terrible things. And listen to horrible claims on CNN,<br>
about YOU and ME.<br>
<p>
And what does this say about GOD?  when people say, "Why should I listen to you<br>
, you people are connected to that Cult in Texas."  How can I as a Christian<br>
continue.  this type of thing i believe, will be the thing that will lead many<br>
out of the church.<br>
<p>
think about this.  THE ONLY PRESS THAT THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH HAS<br>
RECEIVED IN THE RECENT PAST HAS BEEN A CONNECTION TO A CULT WHERE CULT MEMBERS<br>
WERE KILLING GOVERNMENT AGENTS.  This is NOT good.<br>
<p>
To me this should serve as a call to arms, so to speak, to show the world the<br>
wonderful things about the God we serve. and the beauty of the Advent Message.<br>
<p>
thanks for putting up with my rambling.<br>

Happy reading.  It is all fascinating stuff.  I especially like his book<br>
on the Sabbath, called _The Forgotten Day_.  His commentary on Revelation<br>
is lovely also -- puts Christ at the center of all the prophecies.<br>

The creator knew what he was doing.  You will notice that the meats that<br>
are forbidden, are those of scavengers/carnivors.  Both classes of animals<br>
concentrate toxins, and deseases.  After the flood, GOD allowed the<br>
eating of meat because apparently there was little vegetation left, and<br>
he knew it would shorten sinful man's life span.<br>

Well I voted on the Monday before the election. Yes, voting is mandatory<br>
(unfortunately), and elections are *always* on Saturday, but it is<br>
absolutely no problem to get a pre-poll vote. You can either walk into<br>
an electoral office and vote, or apply for a postal vote. There are <br>
various things which can make a person eligible for a pre-poll vote, and<br>
one of them is "religious beliefs".<br>
<p>
In fact, at Cooranbong, where there is a very high density of SDAs, a<br>
special pre-poll voting booth is set up for a week at one of the local<br>
churches every election time. <br>
<p>
Unfortunately none of these things help improve the quality of the<br>
political candidates.<br>

Election day in the United States is always on a Tuesday, but in the <br>
Presidential nominating process the primary elections and caucuses are <br>
on different days.  The Michigan caucus has been on Saturday for the<br>
last few elections.  As a result I was not able to participate when I lived<br>
there.<br>

Even in the more conservative circles in Australia, I don't think the<br>
wearing of wedding rings has ever been an issue. For the woman, that is.<br>
Until recently, SDA ministers were not permitted to perform double ring<br>
ceremonies. This has always seemed a little strange to us here, since<br>
most of the grass roots membership didn't feel in themselves that there was<br>
any real difference between a woman and a man wearing a ring. Perhaps that<br>
stance was a carry-over from the U.S., where it seems that wedding rings<br>
have been and are controversial. Anyhow, double-ring ceremonies are now<br>
the norm inside and outside of the SDA church. I know of no trend outside<br>
the church away from wearing wedding rings, either.<br>

wedding band goes on left ring finger (next to little finger).  Goes way<br>
back to the time when no one knew much about anatomy, it was thought that<br>
there was a "heart channel" that connected the ring finger to the heart.<br>
Two rings, one plain or small stone, one large stone.  (engagement ring<br>
and wedding band).  Generaly, depending on the amount of money the groom has<br>
, the engagement ring will have  a small stone, and the wedding band may<br>
or may not have a stone.  Adventist guidlines are an unadorned  (plain<br>
wedding band).  Generaly it is "permitted" to wear a wedding band  in <br>
conditions where the culture demands it, or in a situation where there<br>
might be some mistake about ones marital status.  An example is a young<br>
married women in a secular college.  Most men automatically conclude that<br>
any woman not wearing a wedding or engagement band, is available.  It helps<br>
fend off unwanted advances.  There are other symbols in other conditions<br>
and cultures that serve the same purpose.  Rings on other fingers have no<br>
particular meaning, other than ornamentation or carrying wealth. (rings<br>
were originally conceived as a conveinient way to carry wealth without<br>
a major risk of losing it.).  When I got married, (to a nice adventist<br>
gal) neither one of use wanted a ring.  I would wear one, but my wife would<br>
not.  So, I wanted to get her a stone instead.  Just a plain un-mounted<br>
stone.  I *REALLY* wanted an alexanderite (fantastic, wonderful stone), but<br>
when I discovered that carrat for carrat it was nearly 2 times as expensive<br>
as diamond, I backed off.  Instead, she said that she wanted a cedar chest.<br>
I wound up buying an antique cedar wardrobe (which is much used and treasured)<br>
and a 1/2 Krugerand gold coin.  Turns out that she has felt guilty about<br>
owning the coin for years.  Something with EGW having said that we should not<br>
have silver and gold, but should sell them.  We still have the coin, but<br>
one day we probably will sell it.  It stays in a ring box, in a secure place.<br>

When I spoke of the world "moving away from the wedding ring code just<br>
as the SDA church is embracing it", I refered to the trend that many<br>
women who are not married are now wearing wedding rings or similar-looking<br>
rings to make you think they are.  I certainly have not seen the abandonment<br>
of the ring anywhere.  And there are some women who wear so many rings<br>
you can't tell what they are all for.<br>
<p>
As long as we're on the subject, time was that male earrings, either one or<br>
both, conveyed a significant message.  But it seems that this code in the <br>
"world" may be breaking down as well.  Are male earrings supposed to mean<br>
anything anymore?  Will this be the next "non-ornamental piece of metal"<br>
we recognize now that the wedding ring has joined the broach, the stick-pin,<br>
the tie-tack, the cuff-link, and the gold watch as acceptable?  Has this<br>
trend reached the major salt shakers of Adventism as yet?<br>

Perhaps the clue to this is in Genesis 7:2,3. God speaking to Noah...<br>
"Take with you seven of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate,<br>
and two of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, ..."<br>
<p>
If this really is what God said to Noah, then clearly there was a distinction<br>
even then between different kinds of animal. Some were considered clean, and<br>
others unclean. Maybe it was unecessary for God to say,"Now, Noah, only eat<br>
the clean animals". Or maybe it just wasn't necessary for that to be <br>
recorded in the scripture.<br>
<p>
I don't know about you, but when I read Genesis the single biggest thing that<br>
strikes me is how much is not said. Particular as an SDA who has grown up<br>
with EGWs supplementation of the stories, and with Uncle Arthur's books, I<br>
am always surprised how little is actually there in the text. It is unlikely<br>
that a "watertight" case (pardon the pun) could be given regarding the diet<br>
given to Noah after the flood.<br>
<p>
Besides, surely something doesn't have to be "doctrine" for it to be good<br>
sense. Does it really matter whether the clean vs unclean is just a part<br>
of the ceremonial law, or something more? It seems to me that noone besides<br>
SDAs would be interested in the distinction anyway, since SDAs are part of<br>
a minority in the way they treat OT law. <br>

To SDAnet<br>
<p>
The Australian Elections are held on Saturday (Sabbath) and it is<br>
compulsory to vote. There is ample opportunity for both postal <br>
voting and access to pre-election day polling booths. Near<br>
Avondale College polling booths are available for about 3 days<br>
prior to the election day. The same is true near the Sydney<br>
Adventist Hospital. Postal voting is available for approx<br>
three weeks before the poll.<br>
<p>
This has been available at least as long as I have lived in<br>
Australia (30 years) and I think that it is similar in New Zealand.<br>
<p>
I think that most SDAs are happy with the situation. I know that some<br>
folk refuse to vote, and this is accomplished by casting an invalid<br>
paper. Mind you it is easy to do an invalid paper for the senate<br>
where there is sometimes over 100 names, each of which has to be<br>
numbered if you are not voting for one of the major parties.<br>
<p>
Incidently, the Labor Party won another term yesterday.<br>

Re: enlisting in the military, nobody has brought up the issue of the<br>
cost of our schools!  I know many premed and predental students who<br>
prayerfully considered all possible options for paying for their<br>
postgraduate training at Loma Linda and finally joined the military<br>
in order to get through medical or dental school.  Some just served<br>
their required time, but others have pretty much made the military a<br>
career.  If Adventism is upset by its members being career "warriors"<br>
then we should do something to make it more affordable to go to school<br>
without the help of the government.<br>

The recent discussion on wedding rings reminded me that the<br>
question of jewellery had to be resolved in our own house in the<br>
last twelve months. My daughter brought home a boyfriend who<br>
wears two earings in one ear. He is also kind, thoughtful<br>
studious, respectful to us, respects my daughter, goes to church,<br>
takes part in services etc. Somehow a couple of bits of wire in the ear<br>
no longer seem all that significant anymore.<br>

<p>
Yes, we even got news coverage of the Waco shootout out here in Hong<br>
Kong.  Following is a article from the Hong Kong edition of the<br>
International Herald Tribune.<br>
<p>
A SECT PUNCTUATED BY VIOLENCE<br>
By Gustav Niebuhr  (Washington Post Service)<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON--The history of the Branch Davidians, the religious sect<br>
whose members shot it out with federal agents in Waco, Texas, is<br>
marked by end-of-the-world predictions, frequent schisms and a long<br>
war of words with the Seventh-day Adventist Church.<br>
  An internal power struggle led to a gunfight between leaders of the<br>
sect in 1987.<br>
  The Branch Davidians, headquartered in a fortress-like enclave near<br>
Waco, have 2,000 to 3,000 adherents nationwide.  They trace their<br>
history to the visionary prophecies of a charismatic Los Angeles<br>
minister who was kicked out of his own denomination.<br>
  The Bulgarian-born Victor Houteff was defrocked by Seventh-day<br>
Adventist authorities for asserting he had been appointed by God to<br>
"cleanse" the denomination of false believers, according to Shirley<br>
Burton, spokeswoman for the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which is<br>
based in Silver Spring, Maryland.<br>
  Although a number of Branch Davidians are former Seventh-day<br>
Adventists, the sect has been strongly disavowed by that church, which<br>
is well-established in the mainstream of American religion and has 7.6<br>
million adherents worldwide.<br>
  The church was begun in 1863 by some former followers of William<br>
Miller, who had predicted that Jesus Christ would return to Earth in<br>
1844.  Adventists, who can now be found in more than 200 nations and<br>
are known especially for their medical schools and hospitals and<br>
emphasis on health, celebrate a Saturday Sabbath and hold that<br>
Christ's Second Coming will soon occur.  The church, however, does not<br>
believe in setting dates for that event, Mrs. Burton said.<br>
  Throughout much of their history, Branch Davidians have clung to a<br>
distinctive reading of the biblical book of Ezekiel, in particular,<br>
the passage in which an angel is sent to place a mark on the foreheads<br>
of the righteous inhabitants of Jerusalem to spare them slaughter by<br>
invaders.  The sect has believed that the passage applies to the<br>
modern Seventh-day Adventist Church, and that the "destroying angel"<br>
will come among its ranks, separating the few true believers from the<br>
rest, said Bill Shea, a Seventh-day Adventist researcher.<br>
  As a result, the sect, operating with evangelical zeal, has taken<br>
its beliefs directly to local Adventist congregations, passing out<br>
pamphlets in the parking lots and buttonholing the faithful after<br>
services, all the while warning that the denomination's leadership is<br>
corrupt, both he and Mrs. Burton said.<br>
  "They prey in a very parasitic form on Adventist churches and<br>
Adventist members," Mr. Shea said.<br>
  "They feel the modern Adventist church is an apostate," he added.<br>
"So the relationship has been one of ongoing antagonism."<br>
  Shortly after his defrocking, Mr. Houteff established his<br>
headquarters in Waco and named the sect the Shepherd's Rod.  He told<br>
his followers that God would soon set up his true church in Palestine<br>
and that Mr. Houteff would serve there as Christ's lieutenant, Mrs.<br>
Burton said.<br>
  The sect has suffered periods of turmoil since Mr. Houteff's death<br>
in 1955.  At one point, members expected the former leader to be<br>
resurrected, according to news reports and Adventist officials.  In<br>
1959, after Mr. Houteff's widow, Florence, unsuccessfully predicted a<br>
divine slaughter of "wicked" Seventh-day Adventists and the<br>
establishment of God's kingdom among the true believers, leadership<br>
passed to one of the followers, Benjamin Roden, Mrs. Burton said.<br>
  Mr. Roden changed the sect's name to the Branch Davidians and led<br>
the group until his death in 1978, when he was succeeded by his widow,<br>
Lois.  The sect went through several years of trauma starting in 1984<br>
when members split over whether they should be led by the Mr. Roden's<br>
son George, or a new member, Vernon Howell.<br>
  Mr. Howell--who was involved in the shootout Sunday--eventually<br>
established his supremacy, but not without violence.  The rivalry led<br>
to a gun battle in 1987 between Mr. Howell and his supporters and<br>
George Roden, according to news reports.  After the incident, seven of<br>
Mr. Howell's followers were acquitted of attempted murder.  Mr.<br>
Howell's trial ended in a hung jury and the dismissal of the charges.<br>

Terry L Anderson writes:<br>
<i>&gt;The non-combatant option is nearly unique to the US.  Elsewhere, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;variation runs from cases in which nearly every Adventist serves </i><br>
<i>&gt;as combatants to countries where the Church insists on conscientious</i><br>
<i>&gt;objection and nearly every Adventist (at least male) serves time in</i><br>
<i>&gt;prison for it.  Sometimes the position changes very quickly such as in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Korea, where until recently many SDAs served time in prison for</i><br>
<i>&gt;refusing to serve and then, in a very abrupt reversal, we now provide</i><br>
<i>&gt;military training with weapons on the campus of our college (we would</i><br>
<i>&gt;have lost government approval of the college if we refused to provide</i><br>
<i>&gt;training).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It seems that our position has often had less to do with any</i><br>
<i>&gt;principles and more to do with public acceptance/image and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;advantages vs disadvantages of government cooperation.  As the church</i><br>
<i>&gt;(in many countries) has become more mainstream, there has developed a</i><br>
<i>&gt;pressure to perserve (or create) a positive image and acceptance by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the public.  Where cooperation with the government has brought better</i><br>
<i>&gt;acceptance and sometimes other accommodations and where there has not</i><br>
<i>&gt;been a firm position based on universally accepted principles we seem</i><br>
<i>&gt;to have moved toward cooperation (on this as well as other issues).  </i><br>
<p>
This raises the question of how far to go in making compromises with<br>
governments or communities in order to stay legal or to have their favour.<br>
It is understandable to want to avoid trouble with the authorities --<br>
it is harder to run a church when you have to go underground: no premises,<br>
no official business, and everything has to be done covertly, like some<br>
cults do it, not to mention that it is harder to get converts or do<br>
evangelism. I bet when the really serious persecuition starts, a lot of<br>
Adventists will leave the church.<br>
	Still, how far should we go in compromising our principles or<br>
standards?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Since I do not look to my church to determine my position for me, such</i><br>
<i>&gt;changes don't bother me deeply, but I feel badly for others who have</i><br>
<i>&gt;felt compelled to pay a high personal price (prison, ...) for</i><br>
<i>&gt;maintaining the church's position and then have that abruptly change.</i><br>
<p>
Well, i feel quite bad for the Koreans who do not believe it right to<br>
serve as combattents and then find that the church organisation is not<br>
backing them up. It must be like trying to be a Sabbath keeper in a<br>
Sunday church. When i was facing difficulties in the army, i called up<br>
the pastor and he spoke to my officer to try to explain our stand and to<br>
tell him that i was not in fact a fanatic freak. I also got a lot of<br>
prayer support and moral encouragement from fellow church members. All<br>
that helped me a lot and kept me from freaking out under the stress.<br>
I wonder how it would be like if the church had not had the same stand<br>
as me. I would have felt a lot worse i'm sure.<br>
	Perhaps thats how the reformed SDA church split happened in Germany.<br>
<p>

Thanks Steve for the switch back. Sorry for all the confusion. I did pick <br>
up most of the messages from AOL last evening. That is ok of course on the <br>
back messages.<br>
<p>
Wanted to share a couple of things with the net from messages that I have <br>
gleaned the last week or so.<br>
<p>
Wedding rings: I am not sure exactly about the tradition of wearing wedding <br>
rings on left hand.  I do know that the tradition is that there is a <br>
"nerve" ( I believe that is correct) that runs from that finger to the <br>
heart! I am not sure if it is still the "vogue" but it used to be if a <br>
woman was divorced and single she would wear her wedding rings on her right <br>
hand.<br>
<p>
Law: (Romans 6:14) Sometimes I think that we "nit-pick" on these "law" <br>
texts. Most of the time we can get at the context quite easily. In my <br>
reading of Romans 6 I have the idea that Paul was talking about the method <br>
of salvation. Keeping the law was not a method of salvation. The law does <br>
not save us or can it forgive sin. In my greek text the article "the" is <br>
not there. It's immaterial to try to figure out if Paul was talking about <br>
the moral law, ceremonial law, civil law, health laws. Paul is not <br>
referring to any law in particular but to law as a principle. We are under <br>
grace as a method of salvation.<br>
<p>
<p>
society seminary training is very necessary. Those ministers that slip <br>
through into the ministry without the seminary training are at a <br>
disadvantage. Sometimes they themselves cause their own problem. By this I <br>
mean that I have known of some  pastors without seminary training who never <br>
feel equal with pastors that have the sem. training. They feel insecure and <br>
are alway trying to measure up to the other ministers. I have know of at <br>
least one in Michigan that became a work-a-holic because he never felt he <br>
was doing enough and wanted to do everything by himself -- never could <br>
delegate anything -- He became sick mentally and physically serveral times <br>
in his ministry till he retired.<br>
<p>
Pacifists: I scanned over the messages on this subject. I hope that we are <br>
making a distinction between the  classifications of 1AO and 1O. Before I <br>
went into the service during the Korean war I had to "fight" to get my 1AO <br>
classification.  I was living in Miami, Fla at the time and in my draft <br>
board section there were a lot of Jehovah Witnesses that claimed to be <br>
ministers and thus were trying to get exempt from serving at all. I had to <br>
appear before the draft board in Miami and explain to the committee that as <br>
an SDA I was not objecting to serving in the service of my country but <br>
would like to serve in the Medics and save life rather than take it. I <br>
received the 1AO classification without any problem. I indicated to the <br>
committee that Adventists were Conscientious Cooperators really. We just <br>
would prefer not to carry arms.<br>
<p>
I received orders after my basic training at Ft. Meade, MD to serve as a <br>
typesetter ( civilian profession) on the Stars and Stripes newspaper in <br>
Tokyo, Japan. However, when I got to Japan there was such a need for medics <br>
and since I had that training my orders were changed and I landed up in <br>
Korea. I was attached to the 7th Division and in particular to a rifle <br>
company. I saw a lot of action and was awarded the Combat Medical Badge, <br>
Korean Service Medal with one Bronze Star, and the United Nations Service <br>
Medal. Our division was under the command of Gen. Douglas McArthur and <br>
fought our way up to the Yalu river just short of going into China at which <br>
time President Truman fired Gen. McArthur and we had to pull back to the <br>
38th Parallel. When I returned home I served in the reserves for 8 years. <br>
Just prior to the Desert Storm war I applied to get back into the service <br>
as a Chaplain but my request was denied because of my age. I considered <br>
myself a normal 7th-day Adventist and certainly would object very much to <br>
being classifed as a Pacifist!!<br>
<p>
It was a great honor to serve my country. While in Korea I advanced from a <br>
litter bearer to Chief Medical Aidman in my company. I had several 7th-day <br>
Adventists under my command. Some of them trained without weapons like I <br>
did while others trained with weapons. I always felt that it was their <br>
decision and respected them for it. To me to work as a medic in the field <br>
-- carrying a weapon was a nusiance when you were trying to patch up the <br>
wounded. It was a nusiance when you were trying to carry wounded back to <br>
the Aid station. A 45 cal. pistol was handier because you could carry that <br>
on your gun belt. However the range of a 45 was not that great!! I carried <br>
no weapons though.<br>
<p>
Any comments anybody concerning the above comments?<br>

Tim Swensen asks regarding --&gt;&gt; Subject: Relevance of Prophecy<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would appreciate it if some of you folks would answer these questions.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;am formulating a sermon on the topic "The Relevance of Prophecy" and would </i><br>
<i>&gt;like to gauge the importance of prophecy to contemporary Seventh-day </i><br>
<i>&gt;Adventists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Questions:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  To what degree is a correct understanding of Biblical prophecy important to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  your daily experience as a Seventh-day Adventist Christian? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Without a correct understanding of Biblical Prophecy, you have a LARGE void in<br>
the belief system of Adventism.  It is this prophetic base that leads many to <br>
understand why Adventists are so special (not all, but many).  This also implies<br>
that many already know the Lord and just are having further truth unfolded to<br>
them.<br>
<p>
If you want to see what a correct version of the truth will give you, just look<br>
at the rest of the evangelical world.  They do NOT have a correct understanding<br>
and are "blown about by every wind of doctrine."  I have watched my in-laws over<br>
the last few years.  They are pentecostal believers.  They started out with an<br>
overwhelming belief in the writings of various conservative "prophets" or such.<br>
<p>
Since the fall of Communist Russia, there has been a backpedeling in their <br>
knowledge.  There is a search for commonality.  A desire to "offend no one" no<br>
matter what.  Doctrine is no longer important in their belief systems.  There<br>
is a great break down in what makes them "different" from other beliefs or even<br>
other sects of Christianity.<br>
<p>
Our message of the certainty of prophecy has been the backbone of our beliefs.<br>
<p>
Without this certainty, there would be NO SDA's today.  Why?  Because 1844 would<br>
not have occured.  There would have been no study by William Miller.  There <br>
would have been no real urge to study the prophecies.  Of course, we know that<br>
God's hand is in this and that is WHY the study actually went forward and to<br>
the conclusion that it did.<br>
<p>
We also have the continuation of the prophecies that are leading us forward to<br>
that great and glorious day.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  What about prophecy makes it this important?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Prophecy is a direct revelation of God.  It is the one thing that I can point to<br>
today and say, "See, here is where God has lead in the past.  Because of this I<br>
can trust God to lead me in the future."  Without prophecy I have no idea where<br>
we would be today.<br>
<p>
I can tell you, that without prophecy:<br>
<p>
	- the Hebrews would not have been looking for a redeemer from Egypt<br>
	- the wise men would not have been looking for the Messiah<br>
	- Abraham would not have looked for a son<br>
	- Adam would have died without hope<br>
	- David would never have been king<br>
<p>
Prophecy is sure.  It is the future revealed Word of God to us.  It gives me<br>
hope, looking at how God has dealt with us in the past, that He will do the same<br>
for us in the future.  It lets me know that Jesus is coming again.  It tells me<br>
that while the future may be filled with sorrow, Jesus is the Overcomer and the<br>
matter is sure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You relatively brief answers would be very much appreciated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Hard to be brief about such a wonderfully important subject.<br>
<p>
Yours in Christ,<br>
<p>
Russell<br>

<i>&gt; In the ongoing discussions on the CHRISTIA list, Ruben Gonzalez</i><br>
<i>&gt; (who has been a big help on our side) has brought up the point that</i><br>
<i>&gt; what SDA's say about the Catholic church is no different than what</i><br>
<i>&gt; the various reformers have said, and brought out a various list</i><br>
<i>&gt; of reformers who referred to the pope as Antichrist, including Luther,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wesley, and others.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have heard this many times, but don't know where to find the reference</i><br>
<i>&gt; on such.  Can anyone help?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
See Froom's "Movement of Destiny" for an exaustive account<br>
<p>
I think you may also find some stuff in (the sometimes, but not always useful <br>
book) Questions on Doctrine, and I'm not sure if Mervin Maxwell also mentions<br>
as few in His books "Daniel" and "Revelation".<br>
<p>
Also please help out on the CHRISTIA list, I've spent too much time<br>
on there all ready and need to get some work done of my own.<br>
<p>
[I would say that the discussion has died down on the CHRISTIA list<br>
and we probably don't need to stir it up again.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<p>
For those of you who are unaware of what *YOU* are all being accused of here<br>
is a little sample. [these are excepts from may, very long anti-SDA postings]<br>
<p>
(Just to stir some of you up)<br>
<p>
<p>
Ruben.<br>
<p>
--------------<br>
This has been a very light touch on the Seventh-day Adventist church.  I<br>
hope it has answered some questions and has helped you see the kind of<br>
group the Branch Dividians came from.  The Dividians are extreme, but they<br>
came from a church of extremes, and come by their strangeness honestly.  If<br>
you know a Seventh-day Adventist, pray they will be set free from their<br>
bondage of legalism and health reform strictures.<br>
<p>
The entire Seventh-day Adventist church is founded on legalism and<br>
legalistic aspects.  If you take that away, and remove their errant beliefs<br>
regarding the final judgment and 1844, there is no reason whatever for that<br>
church to exist.<br>
 <br>
It is true that other churches do spawn cults like the Dividians, but you<br>
generally find the rabid cults coming from the rabid and cultish churches,<br>
not the mainline Protestant nor the Roman Catholic churches.  (Remember,<br>
this is a general statement, not meant to be completely accurate.)<br>
 <br>
Now, the real legalism of the Seventh-day Adventists comes through.  They<br>
teach that keeping of the Sabbath will not effect salvation.  They also<br>
teach that the saved person will keep the law, hence, they will keep the<br>
Sabbath.  A bit of reverse logic will show us that they also teach that if<br>
you don't keep the Sabbath, it is a sign that you are not saved, or are<br>
ignorant.  They don't often state that negative, but I have heard it from<br>
at least five Adventist pulpits, and it is said in so many words in many of<br>
the writings of their so-called prophet, Ellen White.<br>
<p>
First of all, there is no link between a high fat diet and cardiovascular<br>
disease.  A brand new Harvard Medical School study of 90,000  nurses showed<br>
that dietary fat intake and heart disease were unrelated.<br>
 <br>
The SDA church insists that the Roman Catholic church changed the day of<br>
worship from Saturday to Sunday, this is pure bunk.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
If you say that Christ is keeping the OT law in the believer, then it is<br>
still legalism, a terribly insidious form of legalism, and just as wrong as<br>
overt legalizm.<br>
 <br>
White declared that many things were sins, and here is a partial list:<br>
  - Dancing,<br>
  - Theatre,<br>
  - Card playing,<br>
  - Tabacco,<br>
  - Alcohol, all forms,<br>
  - Coffee, tea, Leviticus 11 unclean meats,<br>
  - Immodest clothing, (never clearly defined),<br>
  - Excessive marital relations, (never devined at all),<br>
  - Sattath breaking,<br>
  - forgetting things, (yup, you read right),<br>
  - Being sick,<br>
  - Having doubts,<br>
<p>
Their health programs stil revolve on the writings of White.  Many of those<br>
writings were copied from health reformers of the mid ninteenth century.<br>
Many of them are just plain wrong, but the SDA church holds to them with<br>
great tenacity.<br>
<p>
 They believe the Old<br>
Testament law is still in force and is binding on Christians. <br>
<p>
Adventist theologians will say loudly they believe in salvation by grace<br>
alone, but when the rubber meets the road, their prophet insists that the<br>
Sabbath must be kept, or the indivisual is lost.  The theologians try to<br>
get around this, but the church leadership will not let them, so they are<br>
hamstrung by ellen White's 100,000 pages of false prophecy.<br>
 <br>
Why do I say they are a dangerous cult?  Because they claim to have the<br>
gospel and don't even know what the gospel is.  They believe they are in<br>
the last days of Earth's history and insist that salvation is by grace, but<br>
insist on works to prove that grace. <br>
<p>
In 1888, a couple of men barnstormed the church with the doctrine of<br>
"Righteousness by Faith."  This issue is still a diving teaching in the<br>
church today.  What these men, mainly Waggoner and Jones, taught was a<br>
confusion of Protestand and Catholic theology, foreign to both, and<br>
friendly to none.<br>
<p>
The thing that is most noticable about SEventh-day Adventist doctrine is<br>
their legalism.  They are fanatic about keeping the Sabbath.  While many<br>
will eat out on Sabbath, many won'e ewven cook food, rather preparing it<br>
the day before, as their prophetess, Ellen White, instructed.<br>
 <br>
The SDA church has a very strong subculture, much like the Latter Day<br>
Saints and the Jehovah's Wittnesses. <br>
<p>
This division of the moral from the ceremonial law is one of the basic<br>
errors of the Seventh-day Adventist doctrinal structure.  That posting was<br>
very good, lots of texts, but it proves nothing.  I once wrote up a chart<br>
such as that, and even had more texts, but it was wrong, dead wrong.<br>
 <br>
Again, as in the health reform issue, the keeping of a Sabbath day holy is<br>
for control, not worship.  The church thinks it is for worship, but it is<br>
not.  It is easy to build a subculture around such stringent doctine.  it<br>
is easy to identify the "insiders" of the group by their behavior, this is<br>
at the base of the keeping of the "Moral" law by the Seventh-day<br>
Adventists.<br>
 <br>
How can you say the Seventh-day Adventist body of doctrine is not<br>
legalistic when the very name of the church embodyes the keeping of the<br>
fourth commandment?<br>
 <br>
The main body of the SDA church is legalistic.  They will not work on<br>
Sabbath, they generally will not go to the movies, nor drink any alcohol,<br>
nor drink coffee, nor smoke.  If asked, they will say these things are<br>
sins.<br>

There is plenty of opportunity to vote earlier than the final election date.<br>
You cna get a postal vote, or you can go into an electoral office and place<br>
your vote. They do ask you for a reason and accept religious reasons as a reason.<br>

This is in response to Ian Brown's question about work being done here<br>
at Andrews on unclean meats.  One of the doctoral students informs me<br>
that Jiri Moskala, a doctoral student from the Czech Republic, is<br>
working on Lev. 11 under Gerhard Hasel's direction.  However, this<br>
student is currently in the Czech Republic.<br>
<p>
The reference to the journal article is as follows, "The Distinction<br>
Between Clean and Unclean Animals in Lev 11:  Is It Still Relevant,"<br>
_Journal of the Adventist Theological Society_ (Autumn 1991, vol. 2,<br>
number 2, pp. 91-125).  That's more theology than I intend to read this<br>
afternoon!  It does not appear to refer to Gen. 9.  The conclusion<br>
follows:<br>
<p>
"The results of our study indicate the following: (1) The dietary law of<br>
Leviticus 11:2-23, 41-45 (Deut. 14:3-20) is part of the universal law<br>
provided in the Old Testament which is independent of the<br>
ceremonial/ritual law.  (2) Its placement in Leviticus 11 is due to<br>
"catchwords" and alrger literary and compositional patterns and thematic<br>
concerns within its immediate and larger pentateuchal contexts.  (3) Its<br>
linkages with the creation account and the flood narrative within the<br>
context of the universalism of Genesis 1-11 is assured in terminological<br>
and thematic grounds.  (4) The special language of "clean/unclean,"<br>
"detestable," and "abomination" and their relationships join it to<br>
universally valid divine law.  (5) The contextually explicit rationale<br>
of "holiness" and "redemption" joins the dietary law to the "holy<br>
nation" theme upheld in the New Testament for all true believers who are<br>
the spiritual "holy nation" that is separated unto God to be "holy . . .<br>
in all your conduct" (1 Pet. 1:15).  Holiness manifests itself in holy<br>
conduct.  It reveals itself among many things in a continuous<br>
distinction of what God has designated to be proper for human<br>
consumption.  In consuming foold appropriate for God's "holy" people,<br>
the church constantly manifests its Lord in an ongoing _imitatio dei_.<br>
In the Bible God is the ground for ethics, and God's true people live a<br>
life of godliness, a life of holiness, because they are a "holy people"<br>
(Exod. 19:6; 1 Pet. 2:9).<br>
<p>
I should let the thing speak for itself.  However, let me add several<br>
facts, which may or may not be relevant.  Hasel's major theme in his<br>
study is the "remnant."  He is the former dean of the seminary, who was<br>
removed by the board at the request of the president.  I cannot remember<br>
any public reasons being given for this, although it was widely believed<br>
that his actions promoting a "conservative agenda" played a major role<br>
in this.  He has been very active in the Adventist Theological Society,<br>
and this is from their journal.  As I pointed out in a previous post,<br>
this organization split from the general organization of SDA religious<br>
academics.  Membership is only by invitation and after swearing fealty<br>
to a rigid set of beliefs.<br>

SDAnetters,<br>
<p>
I wrote--<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I was saddened by the former member of our SDA church.  He attended LLU</i><br>
as a religion major hoping to become a minister.  However, because he is<br>
blind, the hierarchy (at LLU?) told him that he would NOT be an<br>
effective minister, so he left the church.<br>
<p>
Marcus Responded--<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I didn't see the show, but unlike Michael, I'm not saddened _by_ the</i><br>
former member of the church, I'm saddened _FOR_ him.  Right now, I feel<br>
empathy for him, his anger and pain, which he might have felt when<br>
treated so *UN*Christlike, by a church which prides itself for its<br>
doctrines and "the truth".  Just shows that we must turn our eyes from<br>
the church and set them on Jesus ALONE.<br>
<p>
My rebuttal--<br>
I'm sorry that I didn't correctly read through my editing, but as they<br>
say, Haste Makes Waste.  What I meant when I said that I was saddened,<br>
was that I was saddened by the fact that we have such hypocritical people in<br>
the church which I was born into and have known all my life to be the<br>
only church that I should believe!  (Now I wonder if I should believe in<br>
a church where there are hypocrites galore!) I have always known that<br>
there will<br>
be hypocrites in every church, but I never really knew that they would be<br>
so high UP (in the administration of the church)!  When I heard that<br>
those people around him said that he would not make a good preacher, it<br>
turned my stomach!  Sure, he may be blind, but he felt that GOD called<br>
him, and that the Holy Spirit was leading him, and that he did not get<br>
his calling from some two-bit fortune cookie or secret decoder ring from a<br>
Cracker-Jack box.  And then to be turned down, by people you believe are<br>
not supposed to be biased, that just made me burn up with anger! <br>
I feel that a person who is "called" to preach, should be allowed<br>
to do so, regardless of age, sex, or even physical "advantages"!  This<br>
just shows how much our church needs to learn before we can even<br>
consider calling ourselves the "remnant" of God's chosen people.  There<br>
are TOO many people who will not practice what they preach in our church<br>
and I for one am tired of hearing one thing from the Pulpit and beyond<br>
(the administration), yet seeing something totally different going on.<br>
Obviously, these people in our church need to evaluate what in the world<br>
they believe and why.  They need to quit talking about Jesus and act<br>
more like Him.<br>
<p>
Now that I have gotten off my soap box, I hope that I have made myself<br>
clear.<br>
<p>

re male earrrings:<br>
<p>
	Current social definition, left is right (that is, earring in the<br>
left ear, the person is straight.  In the RIGHT ear, the person is gay.<br>
I'm not sure about both ears, I have heard 2 diffrent ones on that, one is<br>
the person is bi-sexual, the other is that the person is gay, but is out<br>
of circulation.  Used to be, the left ear indicated a pot-head.<br>

Just a thought I had recently...<br>
<p>
We have lots of literature on "how to answer a JW" and "how to answer a<br>
mormon", discussing the differences in interpretation between SDAs and these<br>
other groups. Personally, I would benefit from a similar publication<br>
entitled "How to answer a CB". (Just in case CB is a purely Australian term,<br>
it means Concerned Brethren, and has come to stand for the hard-line<br>
conservative SDAs in the church here.)<br>
<p>
If, as Maxwell said in his letter, there are a large number of "new<br>
theology" adherents employed in the church administration and its<br>
educational institutions, then perhaps some of them could get together<br>
and produce a publication aimed specifically at the differences between<br>
their interpretation and that of the "old theology". I personally would<br>
not be at all concerned if the references to Great Controversy etc were<br>
few and far between, but all points would need to have strong scriptural<br>
support.<br>
<p>
Of course, the first step would be to clear up whether or not there is<br>
indeed a "new theology" at all. Maxwell says there is, and I am inclined<br>
to agree. But some are reluctant to discuss the issue. Bill Shea visited<br>
Australia last year, and I attended a meeting where he spoke on "Schism<br>
in the Adventist church". I was a little surprised when he didn't refer<br>
at all to the current "crisis" during his address. I was even more <br>
surprised when he ducked a direct question from the floor, to the effect<br>
of "There are currently two distinctly separate theological groups within<br>
the SDA church. Do you consider that this could result in some kind of<br>
schism?" Shea's reply was that there are far more than just two groups, <br>
and many of the groups can't agree, but that he didn't think it was any<br>
big deal. What he said was true, but in my opinion it showed a reluctance<br>
to face up to the situation.<br>
<p>
I am a believer in the concept of present truth, and I believe that there<br>
is always room for growth and development. Although I have never heard<br>
anybody define what the "new theology" is, from what I can gather I think<br>
it describes my understanding of God. But I do need some help when it<br>
comes to "answering the CBs"! <br>

We have about six members who have joined SDA-L this month.  If you would<br>
please post to the net and let us know who you are, so we can include<br>
you in the directory, we'd appreciate it much.<br>
<p>
Welcome and enjoy your stay.<br>
<p>
PS:  SDA-L is unmoderated, but that also means it has no agitator<br>
to stir up traffic when traffic is low.  So if you want to see more messages<br>
on SDA-L, post more.<br>

I am looking for a trustworthy person with the time and the inclination to <br>
do me a small favour.<br>
<p>
[For non-IBM PC types, a GUS is a Gravis Ultra Sound board, the premier<br>
sound board for the PC.  SCT]<br>
I am interested in purchasing a GUS, and I'm wanting to compare the price<br>
here in Australia with the cost of getting one shipped out from the US.<br>
Is there anybody on SDAnet who might be willing to (a) inform me what<br>
the current going price is over there, and (b) buy one and ship it out<br>
to me if it turns out to be worthwhile?<br>
<p>
I know this request is not really a part of the "charter" of SDAnet, but<br>
I'm hoping it gets through because I would be a little nervous about<br>
sending x hundred dollars to just anyone.<br>
<p>

I don't know much about the type of people that Koresh recruited. It may be<br>
that many of them believed that the SDA church was Babylon. I am convinced<br>
however, that not everyone with Koresh was of that mode. The person I know<br>
who is over there at the moment, Nicole (her twin brother Peter having now<br>
been reported as shot in the earlier round of firing) was never that sort<br>
of person as far as I was aware. I understood her to be serious about<br>
religion, and insightful perhaps, but I never associated her with those<br>
that were especially critical of the church. That is only one of many though.<br>
<p>

I find it interesting that most of the "anti" stuff on christia has <br>
been posted by an ex-SDA. It actually sounds like the same guy that<br>
appeared on Donahue, although the fact that both are blind doesn't<br>
necessarily mean anything. So the point is that most of his feelings<br>
regarding EGW are probably based on his experiences as an SDA.<br>
<p>
Whatever else may or may not be true regarding EGW, I'm convinced that<br>
her writings have been criminally used and abused by SDAs. Some of it<br>
has been honest mistakes made by well-meaning people, but probably some<br>
of it also by those wishing to add "authority" to their own personal<br>
hobbyhorse. The lady must turn in her grave sometimes.<br>
<p>
 From what I've read, she was actually quite a lovely person, quite the<br>
opposite of what guys like Dan seem to think. Blaming Spectrum, Walter Rea<br>
and Ronald Numbers for the problem isn't really fair either. You won't<br>
hear many Spectrum writers "using EGW as a club". Mostly they seem to<br>
be trying to paint a *more* reasonable portrait of EGW than what has<br>
sometimes been portrayed. As for Rea and Numbers, or Rea at least, they<br>
may be a bit like Dan - just reacting to an unfortunate misuse of EGWs<br>
role and her writings.<br>
<p>
I sometimes wonder whether the way the misuse of EGW has caused some to<br>
stumble relates at all to the text about the millstone around a person's<br>
neck. Gruesome, I know, but it's in the Bible!<br>

Yes, I do have a question for you Paul.<br>
<p>
You say you definitely do not wish to be classified as a pacifist. How<br>
would you describe a pacifist? <br>
<p>
As I said in a previous post, I would have thought a person could be<br>
"pro-peace" and "anti-war", and yet still agree to serve in the military,<br>
since there are other ills worse than war, such as persecution and <br>
oppression. When I said I though most Christians would classify themselves<br>
as pacifists, I meant "pro-peace" and "anti-war".<br>

Just to update the story a little, this blind gentleman is a member<br>
of my church.  He and his wife left the Branch Dividians, taking<br>
quite a few of the members out with them.  They are now actively<br>
involved in my local SDA church.  Over the last few weeks, they have<br>
been intervied on almost all the local tv current affair shows.<br>

I found this in a newsgroup here on the UIC system.  It is copyrighted<br>
material, but can be reposted for discussion.  I think the statement<br>
made about SDA's, and response by Cyril Miller could clear some things<br>
up.<br>

        WACO, Texas (UPI) -- A central Texas farm turned lethal Sunday when a<br>
30-minute gunfight left four federal agents dead and at least 14 others<br>
injured as they tried to serve a search warrant at a religious cult's<br>
heavily fortified compound.<br>
        Four agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms died after<br>
arriving at hospitals in Waco, 10 miles from the scene of the bloody<br>
shootout, officials confirmed. Fourteen other ATF officers were<br>
hospitalized.<br>
        ATF Special Agent in Charge Ted Royster of Dallas told a news<br>
conference there were reports of injuries inside the compound, but no<br>
one inside had requested medical attention. He said negotiations were<br>
continuing.<br>
        ``We want to bring the situation to an end. There are ongoing<br>
negotiations between negotiators and Mr. Koresh (the leader). We want to<br>
get his people out of there first. We have constant telephone contact.''<br>
        Royster said there were 70 to 75 people in the compound. About 30 are<br>
males, eight are juveniles, the rest are females.<br>
        ATF asked Dallas radio station KRLD to broadcast a statement so it<br>
could be heard in the compound. It read, ``ATF will not initiate any<br>
aggressive action. Negotiations are going on and both parties are<br>
seeking a peaceful resolution of the situation.''<br>
        Royster said ATF had been investigating the cult for nearly eight<br>
months and the raid had been planned for weeks. He said gunfire erupted<br>
before agents could make any verbal contact with those inside.<br>
        ``We practiced for it. They drilled over and over again, and we had<br>
our plan down... we had a diversion down. All went into effect, and they<br>
were waiting,'' he said.<br>
        ``We know of them buying firearms, and we have heard of explosives at<br>
the compound,'' ATF spokesman Tom Hill said in Washington. ``We went out<br>
there to serve the warrant and look for the devices.''<br>
        The warrant named Vernon Howell, who also uses the name David Koresh,<br>
according to Royster. He is the 33-year-old charismatic leader of the 75<br>
so-called Branch Davidians who live in the 77-acre Mount Carmel<br>
compound.<br>
        In a telephone interview with CNN, Howell said he was ``shot in<br>
several places.'' Asked how he was feeling, Howell said: ``Weakening.''<br>
Several times during the interview, his voice broke and his breathing<br>
was labored.<br>
        He said he had given authorities a message to be broadcast over an<br>
area radio station. ``''We'll send two children out every time they play<br>
the message,`` Howell said. ''I'll send two children out every time<br>
until they're all gone.``<br>
        Asked if his followers inside the compound were well armed, Howell<br>
said, ``Yeah, we're heavily armed.'' He declined to reveal any details<br>
of weapons inside the compound.<br>
        The siege began at 9:30 a.m. CST, when 150 to 200 federal, state and<br>
local law officers arrived to serve the warrant and look for illegal<br>
firearms or explosive devices at the fortress-like compound equipped<br>
with a watch tower.<br>
        When the officers arrived, backed up by three helicopters, they were<br>
met with immediate gunfire, Royster said. Officers dressed in bullet-<br>
proof vests and carrying shields stormed the compound and a 30-minute<br>
gunfight broke out.<br>
        Royster said after the initial gunfight, a ceasefire was negotiated<br>
with Howell to allow the ATF to remove its wounded from the<br>
headquarters.<br>
        Heavily-armed ATF agents picked up and carried their wounded from the<br>
compound. Some of the injured were placed atop the hoods of ATF vehicles<br>
for transport to where helicopters could airlift them to Waco hospitals.<br>
        Among the arms at the compound was reportedly a 50-caliber machine<br>
gun which could easily have downed one of the helicopters. Two of the<br>
helicopters were hit by gunfire, Royster said, apparently from a semi-<br>
automatic AR-15 rifle.<br>
        Dramatic KWTX-TV videotape showed one ATF officer lying on the roof<br>
next to a window after two other officers had gone inside. A torrent of<br>
gunfire ripped through the wall and he rolled down the roof to a ladder<br>
to escape.<br>
        KWTX-TV reporter John McLemore, who witnessed the firefight with a<br>
camerman, said he used his vehicle to transport three wounded federal<br>
agents from the scene of the bloody battle after officers yelled for<br>
help.<br>
        ``Somebody yelled 'Hey, television get an ambulance.'' I ran back to<br>
the truck, and then I heard a couple of shots hit the truck. I called my<br>
news director and told him we need every ambulance you can get out here.<br>
``<br>
        The cult moved to the Waco area many years ago and came to public<br>
attention this weekend with a copyright series published in the The Waco<br>
Tribune-Herald.<br>
        The cult, estimated at about 75 members male and female, is awaiting<br>
the end of the world, the newspaper reported. Howell, the latest leader<br>
of the cult that moved from Los Angeles in 1935, claims to be Christ.<br>
        Former members of the cult told the Tribune-Herald that Howell abuses<br>
both adult and child members of the cult and claims at least 15 wives.<br>
Howell denies these charges, saying he has had only two children.<br>
        The Branch Davidians is an old off-shoot of the Seventh-day Adventist<br>
Church, but the Seventh-Day Adventist Church strongly denies any<br>
connection with Howell's group which was founded in 1934 by Victor<br>
Houteff.<br>
        At Fort Worth, a spokesman for the Seventh Day Adventist Church said<br>
they have no connection with Howell's group and deplore what happened<br>
near Waco.<br>
        Cyrill Miller, president of the church's southwest region, said,<br>
``There are absolutely no connections whatsoever with the Seventh-Day<br>
Adventist Church -- never have been and never will be.''<br>
        Local welfare workers visited the cult's compound at least twice last<br>
year to talk to the children there, former cult members told the<br>
Tribune-Herald. Juvenile officils refused to discuss details of their<br>
investiglation.<br>
        Howell and his followers believe he is the lamb referred to in the<br>
Bible's book of Revelation, the newspaper said. His followers say he<br>
alone can open the so-called Seven Seals, setting loose events that the<br>
Branch Davidians believe will end mankind and propel Howell and his<br>
followers into heaven.<br>
        Howell told the Tribune-Herald, ``If the Bible is true, then I'm<br>
Christ. But so what? Look at 2,000 years ago. What's so great about<br>
being Christ? A man nailed to the cross. A man of sorrow acquainted with<br>
grief. You know, being Christ ain't nothing. Know what I mean? ... If<br>
the Bible is true, I'm Christ. If the Bible is true. But all I want out<br>
of this is for people to be honest this time.''<br>
        The cult was founded in Los Angeles when Houteff left the Seventh-Day<br>
Adventist Church because his interrpetation of the book of Revelation<br>
disagreed with the church's view. It has had several leaders and<br>
divisions since Houteff's death in 1955.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; re male earrrings:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Current social definition, left is right (that is, earring in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; left ear, the person is straight.  In the RIGHT ear, the person is gay.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure about both ears, I have heard 2 diffrent ones on that, one is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the person is bi-sexual, the other is that the person is gay, but is out</i><br>
<i>&gt; of circulation.  Used to be, the left ear indicated a pot-head.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cheers</i><br>
<i>&gt; Woody</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- </i><br>
<p>
Well, if a man has earrings in both ears, it depends on how many<br>
earrings, and on which ear.  As long as a man has one more earring on<br>
his left ear, he is considered straight.  But if even numbers on both<br>
ears or more earrings on his right ear, he is supposed to be gay (of<br>
course, there are wierd people out there, so watch out for those few<br>
exceptions to the rule :-D).  <br>

Hi,<br>
<p>
Just my tips on how to answer a CB   ;^)<br>
<p>
Its really easy and you don't need to get all of the liberal/new theology<br>
people to put in any effort. Just go to any evangelical and ask them<br>
to supply some of their standards anti-SDA proof texts.<br>
<p>
In fact I've got heaps of them saved up from all of my encounters<br>
with evangelicals. I could post them if you like  :^)<br>
<p>
There are some really good ones going around on bit.listserv.Christia<br>
at the moment :^))<br>
<p>

I am not surprised that Bill Shea thought that there is no danger of imminent<br>
schism in the SDA church.  He has expressed the same sentiments to me in <br>
small group conversation.  I understood him to say that the various groups,<br>
the right-wing ones specifically, are parasitic on the main church, and if <br>
they were to destroy their host, they could not survive.  <br>
<p>
The essential problem that has to be conquered in dealing with these people<br>
is one of communication.  We must first of all realize that the discourses<br>
in such magazines as Our Firm Foundation were at one point the major form<br>
of communication that existed in the church, and the alligator-skinned<br>
SDA's of that era were used to it.  Alden Thompson in his book "Inspiration"<br>
shows how various SDA literature of the 20's and 30's promoted the concept<br>
of verbal inspiration of the Bible and Ellen G. White, in direct<br>
contradiction to what EGW said.  The fundamentalist tendency in Adventism<br>
arose in parallel to the rise of fundamentalism in America.  To many people<br>
verbal inspiration is still the way to treat the inspired writings, and <br>
most critics of EGW are those who, having exploded the verbal inspiration <br>
myth, conclude that there is no inspiration there at all.<br>
<p>
So, on one side we have the DADs (Do As Demanded) who apply the doctrine <br>
of creeping inspiration:  Mr. X. says you should believe such a way,<br>
and Ellen G. White said he was right, and since I agree with Mr. X,<br>
therefore my will is the word of the Lord and you are going to burn a<br>
few minutes longer in hell.  <br>
<p>
On the other side we have the MOMs  (Mirror Of Me) who also refer to<br>
inspiration in an absolute sense, but reject and fight it in such a way<br>
as to exclude any other interpretation.  "Ellen G. White ate meat once<br>
so she didn't practice what she preached and I can do what I want."<br>
<p>
There is little common terminology between the two groups.  The recent<br>
flashpoint issue (since 1957) has been the nature of Christ.  One group <br>
argues that Christ had a sinful nature, the other that He did not.<br>
 Neither side knows what they mean by the term "nature", nor does either<br>
side mean the same thing by it.  the "CB's" find it incomprehensible <br>
that Christ could be in any way different from the humans of His day<br>
"This would give Him an unfair advantage."  Their opponents think<br>
that for Christ to have a "sinful nature" would be impossible because<br>
"then He would have had to sin."  They never stop to think that both <br>
positions could be wrong, and that by extension, any blending of the <br>
two answers is also wrong.   <br>
<p>
So I think that the first key is to show respect, if not concurrence,<br>
with whatever view of authority the person may have.  The second key<br>
is to make sure that your terms are defined similarly.  The third<br>
is to not get so tied into binary logic to ignore other possible solutions.<br>
<p>
"Faith and love" can be turned into legalism if one is not careful.<br>
I will always remember a gentleman in a church I went to who emphasized<br>
with a scowl "The only important thing is to show the love of Jesus Christ."<br>
This is the same person who told me "if the visiting young people are<br>
going to take the seats of the old ladies who have had them for years,<br>
then they <br>
shouldn't come at all."  It is, however, a measure of my conservative<br>
communication credentials that he was telling me all this thinking I might<br>
be a sympathetic ear, not realizing that I had organized the youth rally<br>
that had so ticked him off.  Having been through 22 years of Michigan<br>
Adventism,<br>
I can always speak the conservative language even in the modern age when <br>
God isn't a Republican anymore.<br>

I'm associated daily with Fermilab.  Fermilab's organizational chart is <br>
different from a typical organizational chart in that prestige and <br>
power is derived not so much from what you say or the office you hold,<br>
but the type of physics you do.  Fermilab's goal is to do high-energy<br>
physics.  Most of the top-level people they hire are physicists because<br>
they are needed and because it's easier to justify budget for physicists<br>
than some other kinds of employees.<br>
<p>
This leaves us with a laboratory where physicists are in charge of<br>
everything.  A physicist in charge of directing the digging of water<br>
and sewer lines.  A physicist  (many, in fact) in charge of computing.<br>
A physicist as assistant director for finance.  Another physicst as<br>
assistant director for construction.  You get the idea--if the job can<br>
be performed<br>
by a physicist, it is performed by a physicist, and sometimes even when <br>
this job assignment is not optimal, for instance, assigning a physicist like<br>
myself to do electronics debugging.<br>
<p>
I think the point is clear, and the analogy to the SDA church and<br>
the job placement of pastors is a one-to-one mapping.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am looking for a trustworthy person with the time and the inclination to </i><br>
<i>&gt; do me a small favour.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [For non-IBM PC types, a GUS is a Gravis Ultra Sound board, the premier</i><br>
<i>&gt; sound board for the PC.  SCT]</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am interested in purchasing a GUS, and I'm wanting to compare the price</i><br>
<i>&gt; here in Australia with the cost of getting one shipped out from the US.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is there anybody on SDAnet who might be willing to (a) inform me what</i><br>
<i>&gt; the current going price is over there, and (b) buy one and ship it out</i><br>
<i>&gt; to me if it turns out to be worthwhile?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I know this request is not really a part of the "charter" of SDAnet, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm hoping it gets through because I would be a little nervous about</i><br>
<i>&gt; sending x hundred dollars to just anyone.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tony</i><br>
<i>&gt; [Watch out for import duties, and if you would put it in writing for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-SDA, do it for a net member as well.  SCT]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Tony,  I'll be happy to check out the prices for the GUS here in the<br>
Portland Oregon USA area.  I let you know some prices in a few days.<br>

Religions of Christendom have erred on both sides of the question<br>
of the nature of Christ.<br>
<p>
 1) Those, such as the JW and Mormons who see less than full<br>
    divinity in Christ.  Some, for example, finding Jesus to<br>
    be the created or birthed brother of Lucifer.<br>
<p>
 2) Those, such as the Catholics, who in various different ways<br>
    have their various versions of the immaculate conception.<br>
    The Catholics claim this through His "perfect" mother Mary.<br>
    The Protestants claiming, without scripture, that Jesus<br>
    was born with a nature that was better off than Adam before<br>
    he fell.<br>
<p>
1) Uriah Smith is said to have subscribed to some of the first type<br>
   of error.  So, there were and probably are SDAs who err on that side.<br>
<p>
2) Much more common are the SDAs who claim the preAdam position.<br>
<p>
1) There are lots of folks out there who are quick to insist that<br>
   any church that falls short on the divinity of Jesus is a Cult.<br>
<p>
2) But many of these same people insist that it was utterly impossible<br>
   for Jesus to have failed in His mission, that is to have sinned.<br>
   Is this not "denying the power", is this not denying that Jesus<br>
   was tempted in ALL points?<br>
<p>
What about the texts that say that those who deny that Jesus came<br>
in the flesh are Antichrist?  It seems incredible to me that John,<br>
when he penned those texts, would have endorsed the preAdam position.<br>
I find it incredible that John could have seen Jesus as having<br>
benefited by advantages greater than Adam's and yet said that<br>
those who deny that Jesus came in the flesh are Antichrist.<br>
<p>
1) So, on one hand, churches that fall short on the divinity of Christ<br>
   are considered Cults.<br>
<p>
2) But 1 John and 2 John make clear that those who deny the humanity<br>
   of Jesus are Antichrist.  That sounds worse than Cult to me.<br>
<p>
In our church's eagerness to escape the "cult" stigma, have we rushed<br>
over to the other side?  Yes!  Has that improved our doctrine? NO!<br>
<p>
Perhaps one of the problems is our definition of sin.  Prebe, of<br>
Amazing Facts, clarifies the issue.  The source of the issue comes<br>
from Catholic doctrine that defines temptation to be sin even before<br>
a baby is old enough to understand what a temptation is.  By this<br>
definition, the only possible way by which Jesus could be sinless<br>
was for Jesus to be born of an immaculate (sinless) Mary.  But if<br>
sin only comes when a person understands right and wrong and is<br>
tempted and then yields to the temptation, then Jesus need not, by<br>
definition, have been birthed by either of the two forms of immaculate<br>
conception.  If we insist that temptation == human nature == sin<br>
then "He was tempted in all points like as we are" is an incredibly<br>
mistaken text for a Bible writer to pen.  If temptation == sin<br>
then Jesus sinned on all points like as we are.  If we accept that<br>
Jesus did not sin.  If we accept that Jesus was tempted like as<br>
we are.  Then clearly  Temptation =/= sin.  Sin can only be in<br>
the yielding to that temptation.  And so it is possible for Jesus<br>
to have our human nature, to have emptied Himself of His divinity,<br>
to be tempted just like we are.  And yet not have sinned.<br>
<p>
A favorite rebutal at this point is EGW's statement about Jesus<br>
not having any propensity to sin.  I have a Webster's dictionary<br>
that was published (a re-print) while EGW was still alive.  Propensity<br>
is used as a religious term that would fit well with the gansters<br>
of Miami Florida drug running fame.  Paul says often enough that<br>
"in Christ we cannot sin".  Jesus was constantly close to His<br>
father, never stepping out on His own.  As long as Jesus was "in"<br>
His Father, He could not sin.  If Jesus had stepped out on His own,<br>
as He could have done, then He would have been just as vulnerable<br>
as we are when we go it alone.  Consider the enormous struggle<br>
He went through in the garden of Gethsemene, to the point of<br>
drops of blood dripping from His forhead.  Can we contemplate<br>
that scene and insist that He was not tempted to abandone us,<br>
to abandone His ficcle disciples who did not seem even to care.<br>
Gethsemene is clearly a scene of Jesus human nature, of victory<br>
over temptation.<br>
<p>
It is interresting that "Issues" says the human nature of Christ<br>
is a "moot" issue.  And yet when Walter Martin confronted Adventism<br>
he saw things quite differently.  After having studied us at great<br>
length he made it clear to the SDA delegation that he was willing<br>
to leave us out of his upcoming cult book in spite of our belief<br>
in the Sabbath, the state-of-the-dead, and a lot of other things.<br>
But he came down strong on his point that we went in his cult book<br>
if we held to the human nature of Christ.  Read his "Kingdom of<br>
the Cults" and you see this confirmed.  He puts SDAs in the appendix<br>
of his book explaining why he did not write us up as a cult in spite<br>
of the Sabbath, the State-of-the-dead, . . . . . .  And explaining<br>
that while certain SDAs (that our leadership refer to as the lunatic<br>
fringe) insist on Jesus human nature, sanctuary, etc doctrines<br>
that the SDA leadership has come around to his position.<br>
<p>
So, "issues" is quite wrong to insist that this is a "moot" issue.<br>
They may be correct to say that leadership and laity are divided on<br>
this.  But it is a mistake to say its "moot".  Saying that anyone<br>
who makes an issue of it is divisive.<br>
<p>
What is interresting is the virtual unanimity of SDA writers on the<br>
nature of Christ before Walter Martin came on the scene.  And how<br>
that now our official church position is that its divided and "moot".<br>

I am formulating a reply to several of the points that were brought up<br>
in the post of the excerpts from CHRISTIA or whatever.  I feel obliged to<br>
point out that Ellen White never ever considered herself a prophetess or a<br>
prophet.  She explicitly went out of her way to make that known in several<br>
places in her writings.  Neither does she have the same relation to the <br>
Adventist church, as say Mary B. Eddy does to the church that she founded.<br>
The Seventh-day Adventist church CAN stand alone on the bible, with or without<br>
Ellen White in the picture.  Sola Scriptura...  My personal feeling is that<br>
we should recognize that we feel that EGW provided guidance that was inspired<br>
to the church in it's formative years.  She also brought to gether much<br>
contemporary material and integrated it.  Once again, we believe under God's<br>
guidance.  I personlly feel that we should drop the swearing of allegence<br>
to the inspration of Ellen White that is contained in the baptisimal vows<br>
that are taken by a new member.  I'm not avocating abandoning EGW, but rather<br>
feeling that our church can stand alone on the bible.<br>
Cheers<br>

[My apologies to longtime SDAnet readers who endured a discussion similar<br>
to this in fall of '90.  SCT]<br>
Dave points out one of the most important points to remember in discussing<br>
the nature of Christ.  Namely, His constant connection to the Father.<br>
Were Christ to drop that connection, then His human nature might have<br>
succumbed to the temptations and we would all be done for.<br>
<p>
The key paradox within the discussion of this issue to me is this.<br>
<p>
1)  Christ was somehow more than a man, otherwise any man could have been<br>
the Messiah and died for our sins.  Yet...<br>
<p>
2)  The Bible says that Christ was "tempted in all points like as we are,<br>
yet without sin."  <br>
<p>
What reconciles these two positions?  The connection (relationship) to <br>
God is something that Christ had from birth which we do not.  That is <br>
the idea of being "born in sin."  Yet this is not an "unfair advantage"<br>
because the same power which He has He offers to us, so we can also overcome.<br>
<p>
If I understand the arguments of the two sides correctly, this should make<br>
both of them mad.<br>
<p>
The second important idea is that a "sinful nature" does not necessarily <br>
mean that one cannot help but sin.  Some would say that sin is defined <br>
only by action.  I'm not sure about that, but I don't think one sins just <br>
by the act of being born.  There are many alcoholics who haven't had <br>
a drink in years.  Alcoholism is just one tendency (which some evidence<br>
indicates is inherited) that can be overcome through God's grace.  <br>
What about becoming "recovering sinners?"<br>
<p>
Anyway, one needs to be aware that different people define sin differently.<br>
Also consider the background of the theologians who thought up the ideas<br>
of immaculate conception and original sin.  These were celibate men who <br>
believed the sex act itself was sinful, in fact the original first sin.<br>
Therefore any conception would be sinful (and the pregnancy a "punishment"<br>
for the woman) unless there were some intervention by God, as in the case <br>
of Mary.  Even Catholic writers such as Aquinas argued against such a view.<br>
Such a doctrine of original sin leads directly to infant baptism,<br>
the idea that the soul is supplied at fertilization of the egg, and the <br>
militant Catholic anti-abortion stance.  There's more information on this<br>
in Peter DeRosa's book "Vicars of Christ"  (He's a former Catholic priest.)<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
But do you get the situation where, for instance, the division treasurer<br>
gets ordained because it's policy to have an ordained person as<br>
division treasurer?  (Would you give your accountant an honorary degree<br>
in physics so that he would be acceptable as assistant director for<br>
finance?)<br>
<p>
Of course, (in the church) this is probably a pragmatic approach to the<br>
problem of finding a suitably qualified person for jobs such as this<br>
without changing the policy book.  But it does have some drawbacks, such<br>
as automatically excluding women from the top positions.<br>

I wonder if there is any official church policy that states that <br>
the conference officers must be ordained?  There's at least one <br>
department director at the GC (Shirley Burton) who is not.  One bit of<br>
SDA history that we tend to forget that the first president of the first <br>
conference that was organized  (Michigan) was William S. Higley, a layman.<br>
We are also seeing in some conferences a trend away from ordaining the<br>
treasurers who have not had previous ministerial experience.  The<br>
decoupling<br>
of ordination from high church office is one of the goals which must be<br>
accomplished if we are to progress towards the equality of women in <br>
the SDA church.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, the trend is much more likely to be to bestow an honorary<br>
degree in accounting on whatever minister is named the treasurer,<br>
than vice versa.<br>

Someplace I heard that St. Patrick was one of the early Christians<br>
in the British Isles who insisted on keeping the Sabbath.  Whether<br>
or not that is true, I offer this reading, written by Richard Harris<br>
and popularized by Wintley Phipps in SDA circles.  <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
"There Are Too Many Saviours On My Cross"<br>
<p>
A dramatic spoken reading written and performed by Richard <br>
Harris on his album, "Slides" copyright 1971 by ABC Records.<br>
<p>
This was written with regards to the fighting in Northern <br>
Ireland which was particularly bloody around that time. <br>
I think its application is much more universal.<br>
<p>
<p>
There are too many saviours on my cross<br>
lending their blood to flood out my ballot-box<br>
with needs of their own.<br>
<p>
Who put you there? <br>
Who told you that that was your place?<br>
<p>
You carry me secretly naked in your hearts, <br>
and clothe me publicly in armour, saying<br>
"God is on our side,"<br>
Yet I openly cry<br>
"Who is on My side?  Who, tell Me who?<br>
You who buried your sons and crippled your fathers<br>
whilst you buried My Father in crippling His Son."<br>
<p>
The antiquated Saxon sword, rusty in its scabbard of time,<br>
now rises.<br>
You gave it cause in My name, <br>
bringing shame to the thorned head that once bled for <br>
your salvation.<br>
I hear your cries in the far-off byways, and your <br>
mouth pointing north and south, <br>
and my Calvary looms again, desperate in rebirth.<br>
Your earth is partitioned but in contrition <br>
it is the partition in your hearts that you must abolish.<br>
<p>
You nightly watchers of Gethsemane, <br>
who sat through my nightly trial delivering me from evil,<br>
now, deserted, I watch you share your silver.<br>
Your purse, rich in hate, bleeds my veins of love,<br>
shattering my bone in the dust of the Boxside <br>
and the Shaghill Road.<br>
<p>
There is no issue stronger than the tissue of love,<br>
no need as holy as the palm outstretched in the <br>
run of generosity, <br>
no monstrosity greater than the anger you inflict.<br>
<p>
Who gave you the right to increase your fold while<br>
decreasing the pastures of My flock?<br>
Who gave you the right?  Who gave it to you, who?<br>
and in whose name do you fight?<br>
<p>
I am not in heaven,<br>
I am here, hear Me.<br>
I am with you, see Me,<br>
I am in you, feel Me,<br>
I am of you, be Me,<br>
I am for you, need Me.<br>
I am all mankind, only through kindness will you reach Me.<br>
<p>
What masked and bannered men can rock the ark <br>
and navigate a course to their own anointed kingdom come?<br>
Who sailed their captain to waters that they troubled <br>
in My font, sinking in the ignorant seas of prejudice?<br>
<p>
There is no virgin willing to conceive in the heat of <br>
any bloody Sunday.<br>
You children, lying in cries on Derry streets, <br>
pushing your innocence into the full-flushed face of Christian guns,<br>
battling the blame on each other,<br>
Do not grow tongues in your dying dumb wounds speaking My name.<br>
I am not your prize in your death,<br>
you have exorcised Me in your game of politics.<br>
<p>
Go home to your knees, and worship Me in any cloth, <br>
for I was never tailor-made.<br>
And who told you I was?  Who gave you the right to think it?<br>
Take your beads in your crippled hands.<br>
Can you count My decades?<br>
Take My love in your crippled hearts.<br>
Can you count the loss?<br>
<p>
I am not orange, I am not green,<br>
I am a half-ripe fruit, needing both colors to grow into ripeness,<br>
and shame on you to have withered my orchard!<br>
I, in my poverty, alone and without trust, <br>
cry shame on you and shame on you again and again<br>
for converting Me into a bullet and shooting Me into men's hearts.<br>
<p>
The ageless legend of My trial grows old, and the youth of your pulse,<br>
staggering shamelessly from barricade to grave, <br>
filing in the book of history My needless death one April,<br>
Let Me in My betrayal lie low in My grave, <br>
and you in your bitterness lie low in yours,<br>
for our measurements grow strangely dissimilar.<br>
<p>
Our Father, who art in Heaven, sullied be Thy Name!<br>

I was going through some old SDAnet mail that had especially interested me<br>
at the time and found the following, written by Woody:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It is important however, that you stand up for your principles.  Let me give</i><br>
<i>&gt;you an example.  I worked for 18 months selling computers and laser printers</i><br>
<i>&gt;for a store here in town.  I told my boss up front, that I would NOT be doing</i><br>
<i>&gt;any show duty from sundown Fri. thru sundown Sat.  Additionaly, I told him that</i><br>
<i>&gt;I absolutly would not attend any function for any reason where alcholic drinks</i><br>
<i>&gt;were served or consumed.  I was sucessfully able to maintain this in spite</i><br>
<i>&gt;of some pressure.  I found that he was accommodating.  I did attend a christmas</i><br>
<i>&gt;party once.  He arranged to have the happy hour/cocktail bar open about 30 to</i><br>
<i>&gt;45 minutes late, so I would be able to enjoy some of the food.  when the bar</i><br>
<i>&gt;opened, I left.  </i><br>
<p>
I can't say I'd ever thought of this stance! I am obviously in a different<br>
position to you as I am a mere student and not a salesperson or other<br>
professional of the suited variety. I have gone to the bar and to their BBQs<br>
and socialized with friends at Uni, I have eaten with them in a pub while we <br>
were attending a conference in Melbourne, and at the same conference I stood <br>
beside a poster of my research project at a poster session (drinking orange <br>
juice) while most others were over-indulging in free beer. It is true that I <br>
have never been with them in any serious drinking sessions but I have found<br>
it interesting to hear some of them "confessing" to me when they drank too<br>
much and saying they really shouldn't, and others saying that I'm really not<br>
missing anything.<br>
<p>
I can't imagine being able to avoid such situations, feeling that a label of<br>
"antisocial" could be given to me which may be worse as far as presenting<br>
Christianity in a positive light goes. But that is just my decision or<br>
impressions of the moment.<br>
<p>
Why did you decide, Woody, to take this position? When you did so, did you<br>
know others who had done the same thing? I'd also be interested to know how<br>
others enjoy(?!) interaction with non-SDAs when the social mode so often<br>
involves a glass of wine/can of beer.<br>
<p>
Thanx.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; I wonder if there is any official church policy that states that </i><br>
<i>&gt; the conference officers must be ordained?  There's at least one </i><br>

<p>
How do you define a conference officer ( A person that gets a salary <br>
from a confernce or a person whose name is in the yearbook under that conference).<br>
<p>
There are many people that gets salary that are not ordained, and there is<br>
also many (including myself) who has a title (information secretary), who do not<br>
get any salary - I at am not ordained.<br>
<p>
If you again talk about ministers, then there are many cvlassses of ministerhonorary etc<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Now that the discussion on bible translations is well and truely<br>
over. Not that I wish to restart it again! I have mannaged to put together <br>
a more extensive comparision of various bible versions. (but not exhaustive)<br>
Like what I had posted earlier with the same verse from various<br>
translations with the discrepancies highlighted. <br>
<p>
The list is long!! (about 52k) So I won't post it. I will email it<br>
to those who are interested. About 80% of the verses have some attached<br>
comments highlighting the ommissions / modifications.<br>
<p>
<p>
Here is a sampling of what its like. (as they say try before you buy)<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------<br>
	<br>
This one has got to be one of my favorites :^)<br>
<p>
<p>
1 John 4:3 <br>
<p>
KJV	And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come_in_<br>
	the_flesh_is_not_of_God: and this is that spirit of antichrist,<br>
	whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is<br>
	it in the world. <br>
NIV	but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus ****************<br>
	********* is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, <br>
	which you have heard is coming and even now is already <br>
	in the world.  <br>
ASV	and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus *********************<br>
	********* is not of God: and this is the (spirit) of the antichrist, <br>
	whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the <br>
	world already.  <br>
<p>
Now the spirit of ANTIChrist is  that which says Jesus did not come IN THE <br>
FLESH ! however these modern bibles testify against themselves that they <br>
are from antichrist because they deny (by omission) that Jesus came IN THE<br>
FLESH !!!!<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------<br>
1 Tim 3:16 <br>
<p>
KJV	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was<br>
	manifest_in_the_flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,<br>
	preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up<br>
	into glory.<br>
NIV	Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared<br>
	in a body ****, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was<br>
	preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken<br>
	up in glory.<br>
<p>
<p>
Yep once again the NIV denies that Jesus came in the FLESH.<br>
Why does Satan hate this doctrine ??<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Acts 2:30 <br>
<p>
KJV	Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an<br>
	oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according_to_the_flesh,<br>
	he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <br>
NIV	But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that<br>
	he would place one of his descendants **************************<br>
	************** on his throne.  <br>
ASV	Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an<br>
	oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins *********************<br>
	he would set (one) ******* upon his throne;  <br>
<p>
Not only is that fact that Jesus would come according to the flesh discarded<br>
but even Christs' identitification here is removed. IS this  the spirit of<br>
anitchrist or what?<br>
<p>

I finally got to look at Ruben's copy of that anti-SDA posting on CHRISTIA.<br>
I guess one man's chains is another man's liberation. <br>
<p>
The writer obviously either had a bad experience with SDAs or has never<br>
really met one from the other side of the fence. If there's such a thing<br>
as a moderate liberal in a conservative organization, I guess you can<br>
put me in that category. <br>
<p>
Call me brainwashed, but I don't see the Law as restrictive. What we do<br>
as a group to codify the law (i.e. no smoking, no drinking, etc), however,<br>
could be construed as restrictive. I think that is the case with the <br>
writer. I am not bothered by what "everyone" says I have to do on my<br>
Sabbath. I'd be more concerned by what Jesus says I could be doing on<br>
that day.<br>
<p>
I may not agree with some of the do's and don'ts of the church, but I still<br>
feel at home with the theological thrust of our group. And I agree with<br>
Woody that, although we should de-emphasize EGWhite's role as a prophetess,<br>
we should not put aside her counsels and her role in the formative years of<br>
the church. The only problem in de-emphasizing her role as a messenger<br>
is that it potentially undermines the SDA's claim of a latter-day messenger<br>
as outlined in prophecy. So much for the pieces falling into place.<br>
<p>
The way I see it, there are Pharisees in every mainstream church. I<br>
just don't believe that they represent the majority in this church. They<br>
sometimes have the loudest voices, with unfortunate results.<br>

I must admit that such posts make me a bit hot under the collar.  Soon I<br>
relax though :) I was wondering if any comments were made in regards to<br>
the scapegoat doctrine?  In looking at the Sanctuary service and in<br>
looking at some of the NT texts that tie Jesus in with the Sanctuary<br>
service I find the Adventist view further confirmed in my mind.  To me the<br>
evangelical view leaves certain items unexplained that Adventist<br>
interpretation does not.  In a related note I found it interesting that in<br>
my historical-criticism slanted OT theology class here at Iowa it was<br>
pointed out that the scapegoat is in context being sent to some "demon"<br>
thing.  It wasn't quite what I believe but it came close.  My only mental<br>
difficulty of late is trying to see how this scapegoat view (where Satan<br>
gets to bear the sins of the cleansed) fits with the notion of Jesus<br>
taking the wrath of God upon Himself.<br>

I was at the last General Conference Session and visited a booth that was<br>
set up to promote some of this alleged discoveries.  I saw photos of some<br>
wild stuff (giant jawbones?).  I also purchased what was supposedly a<br>
first among many books discussing these discoveries.  This was on Noah's<br>
Ark.  He did provide some information about his work in there and<br>
referenced some other fellow who had more detailed information.  I also<br>
got a sheet that had his phone number on it.  I called it once to see if<br>
he had completed any more books.  A female answered and told me no.  I<br>
did, however, see a revamped copy of the book I had at an ABC bookmobile. <br>
When at the GC I did here a little more about the Ark of the Covenant<br>
business.  I heard the story of how he came about finding it through a<br>
small series of miracles.  I can't say whether he has really discovered<br>
all that he says that he has, but the book does point out that the Turkish<br>
government recognized him as the discoverer of Noah's Ark and was working<br>
on a tourist center before making a big deal of it.  The only problem here<br>
is that supposedly this was to be done a while ago, and I haven't heard<br>
anything about it.  I have heard that in a related matter that there was a<br>
CBS special on Noah's Ark and some Christians have been claiming that the<br>
Ark is found.  Does anyone know more about this recent matter?  Was<br>
Wyatt's name mentioned in it?  I am also supposed to be getting the name<br>
of some Texan who claims he has some evidence on the Ark.  On an<br>
interesting endnote:  the claim that the Ark was found was brought up on<br>
my local BBS and one users replied that even if a world wide flood was<br>
proved would that prove that what the Bible has to say is truth?<br>
<p>
Ian.<br>
<p>
<p>
[Allen Roy, a former SDAnet subscriber, was up on these things, and posted<br>
an article about Wyatt.  Roy is a ark-hunter himself, but believed that <br>
Wyatts claims were bogus.  I will try to dig out the article.  I heard <br>
part of Wyatt's talk myself at one point, but not enough to judge.<br>
There was a CBS news special years and years ago, saying nothing about<br>
Wyatt.  I don't know if there has been another one since on that topic.  SCT]<br>

If I were to avoid all places at which alcohol is served I'm afraid I <br>
wouldn't socialize much at all.  For example, at Fermilab, wine is served<br>
before every Friday afternoon seminar, which is usually the most important <br>
seminar of the week.  All work social functions involve the serving of<br>
alcohol.  Many of the parties likewise.  <br>
<p>
I find, however, that I am not usually the only person who is sober at <br>
such gatherings, and I have met some very interesting people this way.<br>
<p>
I am well acquainted with the type of philosophy that avoids alcohol<br>
totally, though, because my parents followed this philosophy while I was<br>
growing up. <br>
When I was young they would never go even to a restaurant that served alcohol.<br>
<p>
(In places like Europe this would be impossible, even Burger King serves<br>
beer, but I digress).<br>
<p>
Now they may attend such restaurants, but they would still never drink.<br>
There are several instances of alcoholism on my dad's side of the family, and<br>
he has done well to stay as far away as possible from it.  He took his<br>
no-drinking stance long before he became SDA.  In fact, his Lutheran <br>
pastor used to tell him that he ought not to drink.  Also, his dad would <br>
let him drive the family home from the various parties and weddings if he<br>
was sober.  <br>
<p>
I have found in several instances that I have been a help to my friends<br>
by offering to be the "designated driver" at some of the wilder parties.<br>
Surely my example of socializing, not drinking, yet not condemning has<br>
been noticed.  <br>

To Net:<br>
<p>
Sorry to mess up your definition on earrings and gays. But, the street talk <br>
in D. C. and Baltimore is that the definition that you all indicated is <br>
pase. Earrings in the right ear do not mean anything anymore. What Woody <br>
suggested was correct at one time but not any more.  At least around here <br>
back east!<br>
<p>
I suppose Gays may wear earrings in their right ear -- maybe more than one <br>
but it does not necessarily mean that they are gay.<br>
<p>
THOUGHT FOR TODAY:<br>

You write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Christ was somehow more than a man, otherwise any man could have been</i><br>
the Messiah and died for our sins.  Yet...<br>
<p>
My response:<br>
<p>
Christ was somehow more than a man.  He also had a divine nature which<br>
we do not.  This made it possible for him to be our Saviour.  But<br>
we are discussing His humanity.  So the issue of the humanity of<br>
Christ is independent from the possibility of His being our Savior.<br>

<i>&gt;Someplace I heard that St. Patrick was one of the early Christians</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the British Isles who insisted on keeping the Sabbath.  Whether</i><br>
<i>&gt;or not that is true, I offer this reading, written by Richard Harris</i><br>
<i>&gt;and popularized by Wintley Phipps in SDA circles.  </i><br>
<p>
Jim Arrabito died in a plane crash several months ago.  He was traveling<br>
the world with his video camera documenting early AD Sabbath keeping<br>
in Australia, England, India, Ireland, Russia, China, etc.  Yes, he<br>
did come up with documentation that shows that people in that area<br>
and time in history were Sabatarian.  As I recall, I don't think there<br>
was direct proof that St. Patrick was a Sabbath keeping.  But that<br>
by inference it was highly likely.<br>
<p>
On the radio yesterday, on my way home, commercial newstalk radio,<br>
someone had called in to say that the Catholic church had sent in<br>
500 sword carrying priests to bring St. Patrick and his church into<br>
line because some of his clergy were married.  Some of what I've<br>
heard about St. Patrick, it would seem that he was a "heretic" by<br>
Rome's standards, but somehow became sainted after his death.<br>

<i>&gt; Someplace I heard that St. Patrick was one of the early Christians</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the British Isles who insisted on keeping the Sabbath.</i><br>
<p>
Eric B Hare, in one his Junior devotionals, for Mar 17, makes this claim.<br>
Out of curiosity, my wife and I dug into this some.  Wylie's "History<br>
of the Reformation" spends a couple of pages on Patrick.  Winston Churchhill,<br>
in his "History of the English Speaking People", also gives some insight<br>
into Patrick's background.  I won't delve into those details here, as I<br>
hope to motivate SDAnetters into reading these excellent books.  Suffice<br>
it to say that his parents belonged to a group of believers (their base was<br>
in what is now called Lyons, France), established by the apostles, who are<br>
known to have been Sabbath keepers.<br>
<p>
I don't have any scholarly references, but Lois Parker (and maybe someone<br>
else) has done her homework pretty thoroughly and has put out books<br>
aimed at junior aged youth.  One is entitled "Duncan, Son of Malcolm"<br>
(Wylie, Churchill, et al, verify that it was during Duncan's time that<br>
Catholocism came to Scotland) and the other title escapes my memory<br>
(maybe "A Sword Unsheathed"?).  Both mention Sabbath keepers in the<br>
British Isles.  Still available at the ABC.<br>
<p>
An older title is "They Took John's Torch".  There is mention of the<br>
apostolic group in France of which Patrick's family.  In general,<br>
the book treats the early Christian church in the British Isles and<br>
the persecution it faced from pagans and then prelates.  Probably only<br>
possible to find thru used book sellers such as Leaves of Autumn.<br>
<p>
I believe the late James Arrabito also produced some relevant materials,<br>
perhaps available from his widow.<br>

It was my understanding that the epistles of John and even the Gospel of<br>
John have elements within them that are a reaction against gnostic<br>
influences that were creeping into Christianity.  I believe that part of<br>
the heresy of the time was to put aside the humanity of Jesus and see him<br>
as a purely spiritual being.  As I write this, however, I keep thinking I<br>
am forgetting something.<br>

Gentry's interpretation of radiohalos (although it is wrong) is not <br>
what troubles me.  In his book Creation's Tiny Mystery he goes farther in <br>
an appendix to attack the theory of special relativity, and proposes<br>
several schemes which violate Maxwell's equations just for starters. <br>
Even this wouldn't be so bad, except that several years ago he did the<br>
campmeeting tour and claimed scientific authority for saying this was <br>
invalid, confusing many SDA believers and building an artificial mistrust<br>
of physicists in the community.  I wrote to him about the obvious violations<br>
of physical law in this section of his book.  He responded but did not <br>
attempt to answer my question.<br>

I was reading the March 11 review today, and<br>
came across something that to me, is profoundly disturbing.  I quote it<br>
here, wondering if I am not reading it correctly, or if others may point<br>
out whether or not I am wrong:<br>
<p>
p.22<br>
<p>
Denominational Status for Seventh-day Adventist Organizations Criteria.<br>
<p>
VOTED: To adopt a new policy NAD C 47 10 Organizational Structure,<br>
Governance and Operations to read as follows:<br>
<p>
C 47 10 Organizational Structure, Bovernance and Operation: Organizations<br>
included in the "Seventh-day Adventist Yearbook" ((quotes indicate italics))<br>
must be affiliated with, and subject to, the general supervison or<br>
control fo the Seventh-day Adventist Chruch and must comply with the following<br>
requirements to hold denominational status:<br>
<p>
	1. Governing decuments:  The governing documents of the organization<br>
(i.e. articles of incorporation, constitution, bylaws, articles of associatein<br>
trusts, etc). shall provide for the following:<br>
<p>
	a.	Relation to denomination:The organization shall be affilliated<br>
with and/or be an integeral part of the Sevendth-day Adventist Church, and<br>
it's primary purpose shall be in harmony with, and supportive of, the mission<br>
of the church.<br>
<p>
	b.	Corporate membership:  All persons who serve as corporate <br>
	members, members  of the constituency, or shareholders of the <br>
	organization shall be members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.  <br>
	Not less than a majority of the corporate membership, constituency,<br>
	or shareholders shall be comprised of persons who are members of <br>
	specific denominational constituencies, board, or executive committes <br>
	of organizations that are listed in the Seventh-day Adventist <br>
	yearbook.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is the one that REALLY concerns me.</i><br>
<p>
	My reading of this indicates that since a church is listed in the<br>
	yearbook, you can't form a church unless over 50% of your members<br>
	are already Seventh-day Adventists.  Either denominational <br>
	employees, or members serving on conference sponsored committees.<br>
	This makes no sense what-so ever.  It seems to be an attempt to<br>
	supress disident groups from forming.  There is no definition of<br>
	"specific denominational constituencies"<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
	<br>
	c.	Board: The board of directors or trustees (or comparable <br>
		governing body if not a corporation) shall serve by <br>
		appointment of the corporate membership, constituency, or <br>
		shareholders, who shall have the right to elect, appoint, <br>
		or remove any member of the board.  A majority of the board<br>
		shall be members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, <br>
		although the corporate membership, constituency, or <br>
		shareholders may make an exception in unusual, limited <br>
		cases where it can be assured that the best interests of <br>
		the organization and the mission of the Seventh-day <br>
		nAdventist Church can be protected and served.<br>
		<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
	This seems to equate corporate membership, and constituency with <br>
	the membership in general.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
	d.	Dissolution:  In the case of dissolution, the net owned <br>
		assets of the organization shall be transferred to an <br>
		organization holding Seventh-day Adventist denominatinal <br>
		status, which qualifies as a tax-exempt organization <br>
		described in Section 501 (c) (3) of the IRS code or sectino <br>
		149.1 of the Canadian Income Tax act, consistent with state <br>
		or prvidecial law.<br>
		<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
	This sounds like a confiscatory grab by the church.  Suppose a<br>
	group formed a church that was qualified and listed under these<br>
	guidelines.  Further suppose the group decides to dis-band, and<br>
	owns property.  This prohibits them from selling said property<br>
	and useing the money to perhaps purchase another piece of property.<br>
	<br>
	Lets take an example.  Take a self-supporting institution such as<br>
	say, Pine Forrest.  It is owned by the Laymans Foundation.  I don't<br>
	know whether or not they are in the year book, but if they are, or<br>
	get listed, then they lose control over Pine Forrest.  Supposing<br>
	that a group decides to use the Pine Forrest campus (currently<br>
	it is unused) and forms a school that they ultimately desire to <br>
	be associated with the SDA church as a SDA church sponsored school.<br>
	(This has happened before).  The Church then obtains a de-facto<br>
	title to the intituion or land, because if it is dissolved, the<br>
	assets (the land) must be transfered to some other SDA entity.<br>
	I don't think that this is good at all.<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
<p>
	Now, if I am interpreting this wrong, please correct me, but don't<br>
	flame me. (my asbestos suit has been confiscated because it is a<br>
	cancer hazard... ;}  )<br>
Cheers<br>
Woody<br>

Ever since there have been conferences (early 1860's) all church <br>
properties and school properties have been held in the name of the<br>
conference association.  It has happened several times that<br>
congregations who wanted<br>
to leave the denomination found themselves searching for a new church <br>
home because the conference came to reposess the building.  Woody<br>
suggested this was a power grab, but in fact the church has always had<br>
this power.<br>
<p>
It sounds, however, that the rule as was posted here is aimed at hospitals,<br>
these being the church institutions that would most likely be subject<br>
to control from outsiders otherwise.<br>
<p>
Please don't bring SDAnet into the context of this discussion.  SDAnet<br>
is not crazy enough to be institutionalized yet!  It's hard enough to<br>
face the <br>
task of becoming an organization with a real charter and a board of<br>
directors.   I have no desire to be listed in the Seventh-day Adventist<br>
Yearbook.  <br>

Regarding the discussion on bit.listserv.christia... it's easy to be brave<br>
on the other end of a remote terminal... if only I were more able to share<br>

Robert Gentry's work on the surface builds a rather conclusive argument<br>
for an instantaneous creation.  Only if you dig deeper, and read through<br>
the opposing literature do you find that his experimental data are seriously<br>
flawed.  I have a lengthy article concerning this that was sent to me<br>
over the net.  Basically, Dr. Gentry has been studing radio-halos in mica<br>
and biotite. (one point of contention is that he mis-identified the material)<br>
from Pre-Cambrian gneiss and granites.  When a radio-active particle decays<br>
into lead, it goes through several transformations, emitting energy particles.<br>
These particles produce damage in the crystal matrix, and depending on thier<br>
energies, the damage allows one to identify the stages.  A more energetic<br>
particle will produce a longer track in the crystal.  The net result, is<br>
that if you section the rock at the neuclear site, you will find a series<br>
of rings or halos, corresponding to the diffrent particles emitted, and<br>
identifiable by thier width.  It turns out that certain isotopes in the<br>
decay chain have a very short half-life, and others have tremenously<br>
long half-lifes.  One of the short half-life particles is a Po isotope.<br>
I don't remember which one.  Gentry's claim is that he has found<br>
elemental (priomordial) sites in the crystal matrix where there are only<br>
a very few halos, and those start with this short half-life (I think<br>
37 seconds) isotope.  This of course implies that the matrix would have<br>
to have crystalized very rapidly to capture a primordial particle of this<br>
particular Po isotope, otherwise there would be parent decay halos, or<br>
no halo (the isotope would have decayed before the capture.)  He further<br>
asserts that the occurance of these is uniform throughout the pre-cambrian<br>
granites.  This implies that the entire pre-cambrian granites would have had<br>
to solidify vertually instantly.  He further states that his samples were<br>
taken from several continents.  In fact, his samples ALL came from the<br>
same uranium mine up in Canada, (which he never mentions).  He further<br>
ignores the fact that crystals form in layers, and indeed, if there were<br>
primordial Po particles is suspension in the melted matrix, there would be<br>
occasions when the crystalization could indeed trap them at the crystalization<br>
barrier. (Note these suckers are microscopic).<br>
<p>
Where he got into real trouble however, was his assertion that the first <br>
person to produce granite in the lab, and prove it to him, would invalidate<br>
his thesis, (or something along that line).<br>
<p>

I guess in dealing with this one must be clear about what bearing sins<br>
means.  To me if the sins get placed upon someone else they bear the sins.<br>
Since it is convenient for me I will quote EGW:  "He [Jesus] must bear the<br>
sins of the whole world.  He must endure separation from His Father's<br>
love." DA 105 (my edition others maybe 129/130).  "as a man He [Jesus]<br>
must suffer the conseequences of man's sin.  As man He must endure the<br>
wrath of God against transgression...[next paragraph]...As the substitute<br>
and surety for sinful man, Christ was suffering under divine justice.  He<br>
saw what justice meant." DA 605 (686-687).  Next page "the sins of men<br>
weighed heavily upon Christ, and the sense of God's wrath against sin was<br>
crushing out His life." "Terrible was the temptation to let the human race<br>
bear the consequences of its own guilt, while He stood innocent before<br>
God." DA 607 (687-689) "Upon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid<br>
the iniquity of us all.  He was counted a transgressor, that He might<br>
redeem us from the condemnation of the law.  The guilt of every descendent<br>
of Adam was pressing upon His heart.  The wrath of God against sin, the<br>
terrible manifestation of His displeasure because of inquity, filled the<br>
soul of His Son with consternation.  All His life Christ has been<br>
publishing to a fallen world the good news of the Father's mercy and<br>
pardoning love.  Salvation for the chief of sinners was His theme.  But<br>
now with the terrible weight of guilt He bears, He cannot see the father's<br>
reconciling face." DA 664 (752-753) And now to the Great Controversy... <br>
"As anciently the sins of the people were by faith placed upon ths sin<br>
offering and through its blood transferred, in figure, to the earthly<br>
sanctuary, so in the new covenant the sins of the repentant are by faith<br>
placed upon Christ and transferred, in fact, to the heavenly sanctuary. <br>
And as the typical cleansing of the earthly was accomplished by the<br>
removal of the sins by which it had been polluted, so the actual cleansing<br>
of the heavenly is to be accomplished by the removal, or blotting out, of<br>
the sins which are there recorded...It was seen, also, that while the sin<br>
offering pointed to Christ as a sacrifice, and the high priest represented<br>
Christ as a mediator, the scapegoat typified Satan, the author of sin,<br>
upon whom the sins of the truly penitent will finally be placed.  When the<br>
high priest, by virtue of the blood of the sin offering, removed the sins<br>
from the sanctuary, he placed them upon the scapegoat.  When Christ, by<br>
virtue of His own blood, removes the sins of His people from the heavenly<br>
sanctuary at the close of His ministration, He will place them upon Satan,<br>
who, inthe execution of the judgment must bear the final penalty.  The<br>
scapegoat was sent away into a land not inhabited, never to come again<br>
into the congregation of Israel.  So will Satan be forever banished from<br>
the presence of God and His people, and he will be blotted from existence<br>
in the final destruction of sin and sinners." 372-373 (420-422) of GC. <br>
"In the typical service the high priest, having made the atonement for<br>
Israel, came forth and blessed the congregation.  So Christ, at the close<br>
of His work as mediator, will appear, "without sin unto salvation" (Heb.<br>
9:28), to bless His waiting people with eternal life.  As the priest, in<br>
removing sins from the sanctuary, confessed them upon the head of the<br>
scapegoat, so Christ will place all these sins upon Satan, the originator<br>
and instigator of sin.  The scapegoat, bearing the sins of Israel, was<br>
sent away "unto a land not inhabited" (Leviticus 16:22); so Satan, bearing<br>
the guilt of all the sins which he has caused God's people to commit, will<br>
be for a thousand years confined to the earth, which will then be<br>
desolate, without inhabitant, and he will at last suffer the full penalty<br>
of sin in the fires that shall destroy all the wicked.  Thus the great<br>
plan of redemption will reach its accomplishment in the final eradication<br>
of sin and the deliverance of all who have been willing to renounce evil."<br>
427-428 (484-487) of GC.  "In like manner [to the Day of Atonement<br>
service] when the work of atonement in the heavenly sanctuary has been<br>
completed then in the presence of God and heavenly angels and the host of<br>
the redeemed the sins of God's people will be place upon Satan; he will be<br>
declared guilty of all the evil which he has caused them to commit.  And<br>
as the scapegoat was sent away into a land not inhabited, so Satan will be<br>
banished to the desolate earth, an uninhabited and dreary wilderness." GC<br>
576 (657-658). "The sins for the righteous having been transferred to<br>
Satan, he is made to suffer not only for his own rebellion, but for all<br>
the sins which he has caused God's people to commit.  His punishment is to<br>
be far greater than that of those whom he has deceived.  After al have<br>
perished who fell by his deceptions, he is still to live and suffer on. <br>
In the cleansing flames the wicked are at last destroyed, root and<br>
branch-- Satan the root, his followers the branches.  The full penalty of<br>
the law has been visited; the demands of justice have been met; and heaven<br>
and earth, beholding, declare the righteousness of Jehovah." GC 589<br>
(672-673). <br>
       <br>
The part of the stuff from GC is what got me really started in looking at<br>
this.  Recently I reencountered the some of the gems in DA.  To which I at<br>
first wondered if there was an apparent conflict here.  Now after looking<br>
at more quotes, I begin to see that conflict fade. Jesus bore the sins of<br>
the whole world on the cross.  To the penitent these sins get transfered<br>
to the heavenly sanctuary.  And in turn they are taken from the sanctuary<br>
for the true believers and carried by the high priest to there resting<br>
place upon the devil.  I infer that those who are not penitent have there<br>
sins revert back upon their own head in the end. <br>

At the 1990 General Conference in Indianapolis, Indiana, Ron Wyatt had a booth<br>
located in a nearby hotel. It included a replica of the ark. At that time he<br>
believed that he had found: <br>
<p>
--- Noah's ark and 15 anchor stones<br>
--- the real Mt. Sinai<br>
--- Ammonites (giants) burial ground<br>
--- Moabite burial ground<br>
--- ark of the covenant and crucifixion site (crucifixion site directly <br>
above the chamber where the mercy seat of the ark of the covenant located)<br>
--- area where Moses struck the rock<br>
--- place where Korah and followers were swallowed up<br>
--- Aaron's grave<br>
<p>
The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) in San Diego has commented on Ron<br>
Wyatt's claims about Noah's ark in a 4 page Impact article of September 1992 by<br>
John D. Morris, Ph.D. This is a monthly publication that is sent out with their<br>
Acts &amp; Facts. Note that ICR is a conservative creation group that believes the<br>
entire universe is on the order of 6000 years old. John Morris has gone on ark<br>
hunting expeditions himself. He goes into the details of why Wyatt's claims<br>
cannot be substantiated. <br>
<p>
A conservative creation research group in Australia puts out a magazine,<br>
Creation Ex Nihilo. In the Sept-Nov 1992 issue (v.14, n.4), Andrew Snelling has<br>
a 13 page article, Amazing 'Ark' Expose. He goes through Wyatt's claims and<br>
states that they are all false: <br>
---radar shows man-made (boat) structures<br>
---there is a regular metallic pattern<br>
---lab tests show petrified laminated wood<br>
---Turkish scientists found metal rods<br>
---metal artefacts have been proved by lab<br>
---there are `ship's ribs' showing<br>
---there is lots of petrified wood<br>
---Turkish Commission says`it's a boat'<br>
<p>
I'd be willing to comment more if someone is interested, or send copies of<br>
these articles.<br>

WELL... many of the parties we have at work, have some kind of alcohol <br>
involved.<br>
I personally get tired of it, and have avoided some socials because of <br>
it.  I had a<br>
nice time at our Christmas bash, even though many people got sloshed.  <br>
One thing<br>
which angered me was getting served a soda out of a crude soda can, <br>
while alcohol<br>
drinkers received their alcoholic drinks were bottled in classy, <br>
festive bottles.<br>
I did more than get angry, I brought my concern to the catering <br>
committee, which<br>
decided to do quite differenly for next year's.<br>
<p>
Recently, some friends and I have decided to hold alcohol/drug/smoke-free home<br>
parties, as an alternative to the bars and clubs which attract many <br>
young people.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
Here is a rather lengthy quote from Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 5 <br>
pages 706-709, but I think it is worthwhile reading.  I came across it this <br>
week and thought it may prompt each of us to more diligent Bible study, myself<br>
included.<br>
<p>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
  Peter exhorts his brethren to "grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our <br>
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."  Whenever the people of God are growing in <br>
grace, they will be constantly obtaining a clearer understanding of His word.  <br>
They will discern new light and beauty in its sacred truths.  This has been <br>
true in the history of the church in all ages, and thus it will continue to the<br>
end.  But as real spiritual life declines, it has ever been the tendency to <br>
cease to advance in the knowledge of the truth.  Men rest satisfied with the <br>
light already received from God's word and discourage any further investigation <br>
of the Scriptures.  They become conservative and seek to avoid discussion.<br>
<p>
  The fact that there is no controversy or agitation among God's people should<br>
not be regarded as conclusive evidence that they are holding fast to sound<br>
doctrine.  There is reason to fear that they may not be clearly discriminating<br>
between truth and error.  When no new questions are started by investigation <br>
of the Scriptures, when no difference of opinion arises which will set men to<br>
searching the Bible for themselves to make sure that they have the truth, there<br>
will be many now, as in ancient times, who will hold to tradition and worship<br>
they know not what.<br>
<p>
  I have been shown that many who profess to have a knowledge of present truth<br>
know not what they believe.  They do not understand the evidences of their<br>
faith.  They have no just appreciation of the work for the present time.  When<br>
the time of trial shall come, there are men now preaching to others who will<br>
find, upon examining the positions they hold, that there are many things for <br>
which they can give no satisfactory reason.  Until thus tested they knew not <br>
their great ignorance.  And there are many in the church who take it for <br>
granted that they understand what they believe; but, until controversy arises,<br>
they do not know their own weakness.  When separated from those of like faith <br>
and compelled to stand singly and alone to explain their belief, they will be<br>
surprised to see how confused are their ideas of what they had accepted as <br>
truth.  Certain it is that there has been among us a departure from the living <br>
God and a turning to men, putting human in place of divine wisdom.<br>
<p>
  God will arouse His people; if other means fail, heresies will come in among<br>
them, which will sift them, separating the chaff from the wheat.  The Lord<br>
calls upon all who believe His word to awake out of sleep.  Precious light has<br>
come, appropriate for this time.  It is Bible truth, showing the perils that <br>
are right upon us.  This light should lead us to a diligent study of the <br>
Scriptures and a most critical examination of the positions which we hold.  God<br>
would have all the bearings and positions of truth thoroughly and perseveringly<br>
searched, with prayer and fasting.  Believers are not to rest in suppositions<br>
and ill-defined ideas of what constitutes truth.  Their faith must be firmly<br>
founded upon the word of God so that when the testing time shall come and they<br>
are brought before councils to answer for their faith they may be able to give<br>
a reason for the hope that is in them, with meekness and fear.<br>
<p>
  Agitate, agitate, agitate.  The subjects which we present to the world must<br>
be to us a living reality.  It is important that in defending the doctrines<br>
which we consider fundamental articles of faith we should never allow ourselves<br>
to employ arguments that are not wholly sound.  These may avail to silence an<br>
opposer, but they do not honor the truth.  We should present sound arguments, <br>
that will not only silence our opponents, but will bear the closest and most<br>
searching scrutiny.  With those who have educated themselves as debaters there<br>
is great danger that they will not handle the word of God with fairness.  In <br>
meeting an opponent it should be our earnest effort to present subjects in such<br>
a manner as to awaken conviction in his mind, instead of seeking merely to give<br>
confidence to the believer.<br>
<p>
  Whatever may be man's intellectual advancement, let him not for a moment <br>
think that there is no need of thorough and continuous searching of the <br>
Scriptures for greater light.  As a people we are called individually to be <br>
students of prophecy.  We must watch with earnestness that we may discern any<br>
ray of light which God shall present to us.  We are to catch the first <br>
gleamings of truth; and through prayerful study clearer light may be obtained,<br>
which can be brought before others.<br>
<p>
  When God's people are at ease and satisfied with their present enlightenment,<br>
we may be sure that He will not favor them.  It is His will that they should be<br>
ever moving forward to receive the increased and ever-increasing light which is<br>
shining for them.  The present attitude of the church is not pleaing to God.  <br>
There has come in a self-confidence that has led them to feel no necessity for<br>
more truth and greater light.  We are living at a time when Satan is at work on<br>
the right hand and on the left, before and behind us; and yet as a people we <br>
are asleep.  God wills that a voice shall be heard arousing His people to <br>
action.<br>

My theory is that there is a finite percentage of the entire population<br>
which is gullible in the way that Steve referred to, but that those people<br>
are attracted to the SDA church by some of our doctrines. Our prophetic<br>
interpretation (the certainty of it at least) and "remnant theology" are<br>
two examples. Hence the SDA church ends up with a higher percentage of<br>
those people than the general population.<br>

Hi everyone,<br>
<p>
The following is taken directly from the reference given here, a book which<br>
is worth a look if you're concerned about the "versions" thing. (I am, because<br>
some church members tried to run my Dad out of town once because he challenged<br>
their claim that *only* the KJV should be used.)<br>
<p>
The section I have quoted is moderately long, but it's not too excessive. Skip<br>
it if you don't care about this issue.<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
<p>
Carson, D.A., The King James Version Debate: A plea for realism, <br>
	Baker Book House, Grand Rapids, 1979<br>
<p>
p63,64<br>
<p>
(speaking about the charge that non-Byzantine text types are theologically<br>
aberrant, where Byzantine text types are those Turkish manuscripts from<br>
which the Greek of the TR was taken)<br>
<p>
A great deal of the heat with which this question is discussed is generated<br>
by the conviction of most defenders of the TR that non-Byzantine texts are<br>
theologically abberant. Of course if their charge can be substantiated,<br>
that settles the issue. For example, no one today, to my knowledge, accepts <br>
the Marcionite canon: all agree Marcion and/or his followers tampered with<br>
the text of Scripture by removing major parts of it (whole chapters and<br>
books). However, I would arge that none of the text-types distinguished by<br>
contemporary textual criticism is theologically heretical in the way that<br>
defenders of the KJV sometimes suggest<br>
<p>
...<br>
<p>
I suppose that no doctrine is more repeatedly thought to be under attack<br>
in the non-Byzantine traditions, according to the defenders of the KJV,<br>
than the doctrine of the deity of Christ. Yet what I have said applies to<br>
this doctrine as comprehensively as to any other. To prove it in detail would<br>
presuppose in the reader a fair degree of competence in Greek, so I shall<br>
pass up the opportunity. Instead I shall demonstrate the general point by<br>
an analogous argument. In a recent article Victor Perry discusses the places<br>
in the New Testament where the Greek *can* be understood (either by right <br>
choice of witnesses or by the appropriate grammatical interpretation) to<br>
call Jesus "God", quite specifically. In his chart, a simplified form of<br>
which I here reproduce in chart 1, he provides a neat summary of the places<br>
in the New Testament where various versions call Jesus "God". A 'y' means<br>
the version in question does directly ascribe deity to Jesus; an 'x' means<br>
it does not. 'Mg.' means "marginal reading".<br>
<p>
                                 CHART 1<br>
<p>
	John	John	Acts	Rom	II Thes	Titus	Heb	II Peter<br>
	 1:1	 1:18	20:28	9:5	1:12	2:13	1:8	1:1<br>
<p>
KJV	  y	  n	  y	  y	  n	  n	  y	  n<br>
RSV	  y	  n	  n	  n	  n	  y	  y	  y<br>
RSV mg	  	  y	  n	  y	  	  n	  n	  n<br>
Moffatt	  n	  n	  n	  n	  n	  n	  n	  y<br>
NIV	  y	  y	  y	  y	  n	  y	  y	  y<br>
NIV mg		  n	  n	  n	  y<br>
NWT	  n	  n	  n	  n	  n	  n	  n	  n<br>
<p>
(NWT stands for New World Translation, the version preferred by Jehovah's<br>
Witnesses)<br>
<p>
Of course the doctrine of Jesus' deity does not depend exclusively on the<br>
passages that explicitly call Him "God"; but the point I am making is that the<br>
doctrine of the deity of Jesus Christ is affirmed by all of the above <br>
translations, with the understandable exception of the NWT. By this I am far<br>
from suggesting that each of these translations is of equal value. I am simply<br>
pointing out that individual passages may be interpreted variously, or <br>
different textual traditions for such passages may prompt two or three mutually<br>
exclusive meanings, without the denial of an entire doctrine.<br>
<p>
...<br>
<p>
In brief I am arguing that all the textual traditions are orthodox, not least<br>
in the sense that all of them teach the doctrins that the defenders of the KJV<br>
construe as the ingredients of orthodoxy. *Some* modern translations tend<br>
toward the heretical by virtue of the force of the presuppositions that govern<br>
the *translation*; but the texts underlying those translations are a different<br>
matter.<br>

What would the organization's motivation be behind those policy statements<br>
Woody drew to our attention? Are they trying to prevent financial scandal,<br>
exert/maintain control, protect themselves legally from something, or what?<br>
<p>
And how do we read it in light of what Nancy has said? If churches and self-<br>
supporting institutions are not even listed in the yearbook, then what do<br>
these clauses refer to?<br>
<p>
I'm confused. How about you?<br>

<i>&gt;thing.  It wasn't quite what I believe but it came close.  My only mental</i><br>
<i>&gt;difficulty of late is trying to see how this scapegoat view (where Satan</i><br>
<i>&gt;gets to bear the sins of the cleansed) fits with the notion of Jesus</i><br>
<i>&gt;taking the wrath of God upon Himself.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ian.</i><br>
<p>
Well, i don't know if this is correct, but i sort of thought that Jesus<br>
took the punishment that we deserve, paid our fine for us, and is our<br>
substitute. He paid the penalty for the sins of the world.<br>
	The devil i thought, will be punished for his part in tempting<br>
the "cleansed" to sin and causing them to fall. Jesus paid for their<br>
part of the blame, for they chose to go along with Satan in sin and so<br>
are guilty also. As such, Jesus bears the sins of the cleansed, and<br>
Satan bears his own sins, which include his part in aiding and abetting them<br>
to sin.<br>

Not being a specialist, I have no right to give a verdict on whether Noah's<br>
ark or the ark of the covenant have been found.  Siegfried Horn, well-known<br>
SDA archaeologist and Bible scholar, affirms that neither finding is genuine.<br>
By the way, this weekend the Horn Archaeological Museum at Andrews University<br>
is celebrating 25 years of archaeological expeditions and Dr. Horn's 85th<br>
birthday.   <br>

I don't know. At my church, they have open communion, and *anybody* can<br>

Hello people,<br>
	seeing the posts about Australian elections is quite interesting.<br>
Here in Singapore, we have had general elections on Saturdays the last two<br>
times i think, i can't remember before that. Anyway, voting was always<br>
a whole-day affair, so as the day they use is different from the biblical<br>
day, we SDAs could go to vote (voting is compulsory) after sundown when it<br>
was still saturday but Sabbath was over.<br>
	Hey, do any of you Australians know a Trudie Anne Desirens? She is<br>
now my cousin-in-law and is Mrs. Trudie A. Chew. She was from Australia<br>
before she came to live here in singapore. Or do any of you know Pastor<br>
Ken Martin? He was my church pastor for a while here.<br>
<p>
	- Beng.<br>

The incoming Bitnet connection to Carnegie Mellon appears to be about<br>
6 days slow right now.  Thus it may take a while for SDA-L requests<br>
to get to me from LLUVM.  I'm getting messages today that are dated Mar. 3.<br>
<p>
Please be patient.<br>

<p>
I'm interested! Ruben, please send me a copy. Thanks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Here is a sampling of what its like. (as they say try before you buy)</i><br>
<i>&gt;....</i><br>
<i>&gt;1 John 4:3 </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;KJV	And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come_in_</i><br>
<i>&gt;	the_flesh_is_not_of_God: and this is that spirit of antichrist,</i><br>
<i>&gt;	whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is</i><br>
<i>&gt;	it in the world. </i><br>
<i>&gt;NIV	but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus ****************</i><br>
<i>&gt;	********* is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, </i><br>
<i>&gt;	which you have heard is coming and even now is already </i><br>
<i>&gt;	in the world.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;ASV	and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus *********************</i><br>
<i>&gt;	********* is not of God: and this is the (spirit) of the antichrist, </i><br>
<i>&gt;	whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;	world already.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now the spirit of ANTIChrist is  that which says Jesus did not come IN THE </i><br>
<i>&gt;FLESH ! however these modern bibles testify against themselves that they </i><br>
<i>&gt;are from antichrist because they deny (by omission) that Jesus came IN THE</i><br>
<i>&gt;FLESH !!!!</i><br>
<p>
Well, i personally like the NIV best amongst the English translations. The<br>
Elezebethen English of the KJV is sometimes a little hard to understand in<br>
some places, for me. Anyway, i find that although the RSV proports to be a<br>
revision of the KJV, the NIV is actually much closer to the KJV than the<br>
RSV, so that if someone is reading the KJV, i can follow in the NIV and<br>
get the same understanding. As to 1 jn 4:3, if you read it in context in the<br>
NIV, you still get the same meaning as in the KJV:<br>
<p>
1 Jn 4:2-3  This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit<br>
 that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,<br>
 3 but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This<br>
 is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even<br>
 now is already in the world. (NIV) <br>
<p>
The reading in the RSV is similar, so it shouldn't be a problem. Anyway,<br>
i'm not sure that the KJV is a more accurate translation than the others.<br>
The SDA bible commentary on the KJV says on this verse: "Important textual<br>
evidence may be cited for the omission of "Christ" and of the phrase "is<br>
come in the flesh." The phrase then reads, "every spirit that confesseth<br>
not Jesus," and places emphasis upon the confession of a person rather than<br>
a creed. The textual variants make no significant change in the meaning of<br>
the passage, for both renderings refer to the teachers who fail to glorify<br>
the divine-human Jesus." -- page 661 Vol. 7<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;--------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;1 Tim 3:16 </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;KJV	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was</i><br>
<i>&gt;	manifest_in_the_flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,</i><br>
<i>&gt;	preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up</i><br>
<i>&gt;	into glory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;NIV	Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared</i><br>
<i>&gt;	in a body ****, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was</i><br>
<i>&gt;	preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken</i><br>
<i>&gt;	up in glory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yep once again the NIV denies that Jesus came in the FLESH.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why does Satan hate this doctrine ??</i><br>
<p>
Well, isn't "appeared in a body" the same as "manifest in the flesh"?<br>
Anyway, the NIV does have footnotes, and the one here says "16 Or in the<br>
flesh." I am not yet convinced that the NIV is Satanic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;--------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;Acts 2:30 </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;KJV	Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an</i><br>
<i>&gt;	oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according_to_the_flesh,</i><br>
<i>&gt;	he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;NIV	But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that</i><br>
<i>&gt;	he would place one of his descendants **************************</i><br>
<i>&gt;	************** on his throne.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;ASV	Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an</i><br>
<i>&gt;	oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins *********************</i><br>
<i>&gt;	he would set (one) ******* upon his throne;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Not only is that fact that Jesus would come according to the flesh discarded</i><br>
<i>&gt;but even Christs' identitification here is removed. IS this  the spirit of</i><br>
<i>&gt;anitchrist or what?</i><br>
<p>
While it is true that the NIV omits "Christ" and "..flesh.." if you read the<br>
context of the verse in question, it becomes apparent that Christ the<br>
Messiah is referred to here in the NIV. And if the NIV is from antichrist,<br>
then so is the SDA bible commentary, because it has this to say on this<br>
verse:    "_According to the flesh_- Textual evidence favours the omission<br>
of the words "according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ," so that the<br>
passage would read, "God swore to him with an oath to place upon his throne<br>
one, of the fruit of his loins." This would agree more closely with Psalm.<br>
132:11" -- Vol. 6 page 146<br>
	So it seems, at least according to the SDA bible commentary, that<br>
the NIV is more accurately translated textually, than the KJV.<br>
<p>
	Well, Ruben, heres another verse to compare, and one which i like to<br>
use to compare translations: Isa 8:20<br>
<p>
Isa 8:20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to<br>
         this word, it is because there is no light in them.(KJV)<br>
<p>
Isa 8:20 To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according<br>
         to this word, they have no light of dawn. (NIV)<br>
<p>
Esaie 8:20 A la loi et au temoignage! Si l'on ne parle pas ainsi, Il n'y<br>
           aura point d'aurore pour le peuple. (French Revised Version)<br>
(rough translation: "To the law and to the testimony! If they speak not<br>
 thus/not in this way, there will not be any dawn at all for the people.")<br>
<p>
Isa 8:20 To the teaching and to the testimony! Surely for this word which<br>
         they speak there is no dawn. (RSV)<br>
<p>
Isa 8:20 You are to answer them, "Listen to what the LORD is teaching you!<br>
         Don't listen to mediums -- what they tell you will do you no good."<br>
         (Good News Bible, footnote to V.20 says: Verse 20 in Hebrew is<br>
         unclear.")<br>
<p>
Well, unlike the Goodnews bible, the SDA bible commentary does not note any<br>
difficulty with the Hebrew here, and you can see that the NIV is closer than<br>
the RSV here, to the KJV (The Hebrew reads "Torah"). If you want to read<br>
some good science-fiction, try Gen 6:1-4 in the Goodnews bible, its far out!<br>
(The gist of it is: Supernatural beings take beautiful girls born to men,<br>
then God limits man's lifespan and the Supernatural beings bear giants...-<br>
like an ET story or something eh?)<br>
	Personally, i think the GNB is better than no bible at all, but<br>
you have to take it with a pinch of salt.<br>
<p>
	Well, no offense intended to anybody, just some thoughts on bible<br>
translations.<br>
<p>
	regards,<br>

Regarding the scapegoat:<br>
<p>
It is my understanding that Satan DOES NOT bear our sins.  He bears his portion<br>
of responsability for our sins.  While he may not be physically responsible for<br>
our sins, he is the "father of all lies".  As such HE bears a responsability<br>
for causing the angels to fall, for causing the fallen angels to tempt other<br>
men and angels, who in turn tempt men of every age.<br>
<p>
I would also liken this to a captain on the ship.  He is responsible for every<br>
member's activity while on the ship.  Satan has made his own ship and is <br>
responsible for bringing the people on the ship.  That is the only type of<br>
responsability that he bears.<br>
<p>
Jesus bore our sins on the cross.  He is our saviour.  Satan will bear the<br>
responsability for his sins and his part in our sins.  <br>
<p>
Viewpoint, in this instance, makes a big difference.<br>

<i>&gt;It was my understanding that the epistles of John and even the Gospel of</i><br>
<i>&gt;John have elements within them that are a reaction against gnostic</i><br>
<i>&gt;influences that were creeping into Christianity.  I believe that part of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the heresy of the time was to put aside the humanity of Jesus and see him</i><br>
<i>&gt;as a purely spiritual being.  As I write this, however, I keep thinking I</i><br>
<i>&gt;am forgetting something.</i><br>
<p>
The Gnostics had a lot of mystical theology including denial of the<br>
human nature of Christ.  Also, Antinomian -- God's law is done away with.<br>
The theory that the manuscripts from which the NIV and other modern<br>
translations translate; the theory that these were Gnostic versions;<br>
seems to have substance when the translations and the Gnostic theology<br>
are compared.<br>

Just a note of caution from a biblical languages teacher.  How are your<br>
Greek and Hebrew?  Good enough to understand the thrust of the original?<br>
Work on KJV vs NIV means little when neither is the original language.<br>

Now that I have your attention:<br>
I noticed a rather unfavorable review of this book in the latest issue<br>
of the newsletter of the Association of Adventist Physicists.  The book<br>
was authored by Ron Wyatt, whom I last encountered at the Friendship<br>
Camporee<br>
in Pennsylvania, teaching this to Pathfinders.  Wyatt is an anesthetist<br>
from Madison, Tennesee.<br>
<p>
Henry Pearl, the reviewer, claims (and rightly so) that Wyatt has<br>
misunderstood the geomagnetic field reversal data to mean actual<br>
flipping over of the earth, confusing celestial poles with magnetic<br>
poles.<br>
(Note that Pearl himself subscribes to the idea of a flood, as well.)<br>
<p>
I find it distressing that there are those who go off half-cocked<br>
claiming this or that piece of evidence proves the flood when in fact<br>
they don't understand such a piece of evidence.  On the other hand, it's<br>
not wise to attribute to deceit what can be explained by stupidity.<br>
<p>
For those who would rather strengthen their faith than know the truth, <br>
this book may be obtained from <br>
<p>
Ron Wyatt<br>
P.O. Box 5931<br>
Madison, TN  37116<br>
<p>
I understand Wyatt has embarked on other such expeditions in the past,<br>
including claiming to know where the Ark of the Covenant is.  If anyone has<br>
further information on his track record, let me know.  SDA physicists<br>
are still doing damage control in the wake of Bob Gentry, and now this<br>
has come up.  What next?  Are there any studies that show SDA's to be<br>
more gullible than the average population?<br>

<p>
About 2 years ago, a supporter of Wyatt's showed a videotape of Wyatt's<br>
work to a rather large crowd in Gladstone, OR.  Mostly how he found what<br>
he did, vignettes on other folks' searches, and whether what he had found<br>
was really Noah's ark (he believes so).  There were some interviews with<br>
SDA geologists/paleontologists (whatever those guys are) voicing their<br>
opinions.  The trend seemed to be supportive in the clips; however the<br>
supporter showing the tape acknowledged that his conversations with some<br>
of those interviewed yielded pretty neutral to somewhat skeptical opinions.<br>
<p>
Discussion afterwards was nuked by some strange character repeatedly raising<br>
spurious objections, such as: "What sort of strange doctrine are you trying<br>
to introduce into the church?  You're wanting us to sacrifice goats!"  What<br>
actually happened was that the video opened with a scene where Turkish folk<br>
are getting ready to build a tourist center at Wyatt's find and the opening<br>
festivities involve killing a goat.  The voice-over was quite clear as to<br>
what was happening.  It was the individual who mistook this and many others.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SDA physicists are still doing damage control in the wake of Bob Gentry.</i><br>
<p>
Can you explain further?  I recall George Vandeman talking about Gentry's<br>
work maybe 20, 21 years ago.  I don't remember details nor what became<br>
of Gentry's ideas.  Remember that he wouldn't be the first to have an idea<br>
and then have it go down the drain.  Note how the State of Utah is spending<br>
big bucks on this cold fusion stuff.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What next?</i><br>
<p>
Wyatt is not the first.  Check out the French guy, Navarra.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are there any studies that show SDA's to be more gullible than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; average population?</i><br>
<p>
Careful; you're looking at a very narrow slice of human behavior.  Note<br>
that this aspect of credulity is not limited to SDAs.  Take eschatology for<br>
example.  Consider Hal Lindsay's early works and the great following that that<br>
engendered!  Folk are still reading his stuff and hoping, despite the abject<br>
failure of his earlier predictions.<br>

The subject of Noah's Ark has been a hobby of mine since 1974.  And I am<br>
currently in the process of organizing Ark-athon II,  a Noah's Ark<br>
convention.  This will be a time with many of those who are or have been<br>
involved with the search for the Ark can meet together exchange stories<br>
and share expirences.  One of the main purposes of the meeting is to debunk<br>
the claims of Ron Wyatt, David Fasold and others who claim that the<br>
durunipar geologic formation is the Ark.<br>
<p>
No, SDA's are not the only ones fooled by such nonsense.  I hear from several<br>
of the other researchers that people from all Christian walks have been<br>
misled by these people.<br>
<p>
If it all works out, Ark-athon II will be held in January, 93 here in <br>
Portland, Oregon.  I'll fill you in as things become more definate.<br>

I agree with you Steve.  It is a difficult decision to make to attend.<br>
<p>
I do the same.  I have been to many functions (never on Sabbath  :-) where<br>
alcohol has been served.  Many notice that I do not imbibe and ask me about it.<br>
It is a wonderful opportunity to witness to the fact of Jesus in our lives.<br>
<p>
There have been many compliments on not being "anti-social".<br>
<p>
Along with this (not pointing fingers or judging), just why did they call Jesus<br>
a wine-biber and friend to publicans?  Could it be the "social" functions and<br>
the people that He associated with?<br>
<p>
Just a thought.  :-D<br>

----&gt;<br>
Christ was somehow more than a man.  He also had a divine nature which<br>
we do not.  This made it possible for him to be our Saviour.  But<br>
we are discussing His humanity.  So the issue of the humanity of<br>
Christ is independent from the possibility of His being our Savior.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Well, let's discuss Adam's humanity. Was Adam created fully human, or did<br>
it take the destruction of his relationship with God to complete his<br>
humanity?<br>
<p>
I think those who say Christ had a "sinful nature" and those who say he<br>
had a "sinless nature", at least in the SDA church, are agreed about what<br>
Christ was. What is not agreed is what sin is.<br>
<p>
Position a:<br>
<p>
Sin = transgression of the law = actions/cherished thoughts/whatever<br>
Sinful nature = human body degraded by thousands of years of the effects<br>
                of sin, which we all agree Christ had.<br>
<p>
Position b:<br>
<p>
Sin = transgression of the law +<br>
      broken relationship with God <br>
Sinful nature = the state in which we are born, ie, with a broken relationship<br>
      with God, inherited from Adam<br>
Sinless nature (of Christ) = complete relationship with God, but still with<br>
      the same "sinful" body that the rest of us have.<br>
<p>
<p>
Disclaimer: this is far from a good exposition of both points of view, but<br>
I think it summarizes the way the two definitions of sinful/sinless differ.<br>
<p>
So my questions on "how to answer a cb" would include "what do you say to a<br>
person who says that transgression of law is the only definition of sin".<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
What follows are a number of questions regarding the celebration of<br>
the 'Lord's Supper' or Communion practices in the SDA Church.  The reason<br>
for this post is that our new pastor suggested, at our last church board<br>
meeting, that there isn't any scriptural evidence for excluding <br>
un-baptized children from participating fully in the service.  While I'm<br>
studing out this issue, I thought I'd post some of the questions raised<br>
and seek others opinions.<br>
<p>
Where young children allowed to participate in the Passover?<br>
<p>
If yes, and the 'Lords Supper' is the anti-type of the Passover for<br>
Christians, then shouldn't young children participate?<br>
<p>
Did Jesus celebrate the Passover with Joseph and Mary before He turned<br>
twelve and went to Jerusalem?<br>
<p>
If we hold a 'open communion' and allow other non-members to participate,<br>
why exclude our children?<br>
<p>
I know it depends upon the child, but how old does one have to be<br>
before he or she can love Jesus and wait for His return?<br>
<p>
As I grew up in the church I was told that I must wait to be baptized<br>
in order to 'fully understand' the significance of the bread and wine<br>
before participating.  What is the relationship between Baptism and<br>
the 'Lord's Supper'?<br>
<p>
Well, I'll stop now with the above list.  I'm sure all of you can think<br>
of more questions/answers.  Just as a side note, my 5yr old son, asks <br>
deeper questions than some 'mature' Christians, and based upon his later<br>
comments he has a rather firm grasp on principles involved after I've explained<br>
an answer(s) to his question(s).  He also seems to put into practice the things<br>
he learns much more readily than his 'more mature' counterparts.<br>

<i>&gt; FLESH !!!!</i><br>
<p>
This is SUCH a short sighted conclusion I can't believe you would even post<br>
such a statement.  You REALLY believe that the NIV compilers, translators, etc<br>
really deny that Jesus came in the flesh to this world and died?  Any body<br>
reading the gospels in the NIV will see that to be a false statement.<br>
 Remember, you don't hang doctrine on one text or even two, but on the<br>
proponderence of evidence stated in the Bible.  To me, to "acknowledge" Jesus<br>
means to accept that He existed, that He came and lived and died on this earth<br>
for our sins.  That is what I read in my NIV.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; --------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1 Tim 3:16</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; KJV	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	manifest_in_the_flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	into glory.</i><br>
<i>&gt; NIV	Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	in a body ****, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	up in glory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yep once again the NIV denies that Jesus came in the FLESH.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why does Satan hate this doctrine ??</i><br>
<p>
<p>
What is "in the flesh" mean if not having a body.  How would you translate "in<br>
the flesh" using today's terminology?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; --------------------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Acts 2:30</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; KJV	Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according_to_the_flesh,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</i><br>
<i>&gt; NIV	But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	he would place one of his descendants **************************</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	************** on his throne.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ASV	Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins *********************</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	he would set (one) ******* upon his throne;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not only is that fact that Jesus would come according to the flesh discarded</i><br>
<i>&gt; but even Christs' identitification here is removed. IS this  the spirit of</i><br>
<i>&gt; anitchrist or what?</i><br>
<p>
You are brazenly suggesting that those reading the NIV are reading material<br>
written in the spirit of the antichrist.  Dream on...I believe there will be a<br>
lot of folks saved and in heaven who only knew and read the NIV or ASV, or<br>
even the Living Bible (should I guess it's too heretical to even mention).<br>
 God can speak to people in many ways, including through His written word.<br>
 The KJV has mistakes as well.  That doesn't mean we should throw the baby out<br>
with the bath water.  I think it good to read several versions and cross<br>
reference their meanings, but for everyday reading, I find I gain alot more<br>
from the NIV over the old english of the KJV.<br>

If other Christians also took this stance, how would we reach those who drink,<br>
or smoke, or use drugs.  To limit our outreach to only those who look, act,<br>
smell, and have habits like ours will severely curtail the spread of the<br>
Gospel message.  Christ himself associated with people who drank alchohol.<br>

It would be nice to have conclusive "proof" of a recent creation and a world<br>
wide flood. Unfortunately, the incontrovertible proofs of historical geology<br>
for either long ages or short ages are about as good as the historical<br>
reconstructions found in court trials. Sometimes the evidence is pretty good,<br>
but there's always more than one side. <br>
<p>
I know of two reviews on Robert Gentry's book that provide another side:<br>
---Origins, v.15, n.1, p.32-38, "Examining Radiohalos," reviewed by R.H.Brown,<br>
H.G.Coffin, L.J.Gibson, A.A.Roth, and C.L.Webster (1988).<br>
---Spectrum, v.20, n.1, p.56-57, "Adventist Scientists &amp; Robert Gentry's<br>
Pleochroic Halos," reviewed by S.C.Rowland, R.E.Kingman, and M.V.Anderson<br>

Though I agree that it sounds a little tabloidish, I have read Mr Wyatt's<br>
book and seen the pictures and they are the most tangible evidence so far.<br>
Having said that I would still approach any of these things cautiously and<br>
with a lot of questions.  The thing that makes verifying of this find<br>
so difficult to substaniate is the location near the Turkish, Iranian, and<br>
Iraqi borders, needless to say a politcal nightmare to say the least.<br>

<i>&gt; This is SUCH a short sighted conclusion I can't believe you would even post</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a statement.  You REALLY believe that the NIV compilers, translators, etc</i><br>
<i>&gt; really deny that Jesus came in the flesh to this world and died?  Any body</i><br>
<i>&gt; reading the gospels in the NIV will see that to be a false statement.</i><br>
<p>
Now, now, try looking beyond the immediately apparent and see if there is <br>
anything else which may be hiding behind the obvious.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are brazenly suggesting that those reading the NIV are reading material</i><br>
<i>&gt; written in the spirit of the antichrist.  Dream on..</i><br>
<p>
Thats for you to decide, all I have done is presented a simple hypthesis.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;.I believe there will be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of folks saved and in heaven who only knew and read the NIV or ASV, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; even the Living Bible (should I guess it's too heretical to even mention).</i><br>
<p>
Hey many will be saved who have kept Sunday all their lives too.<br>
<p>
You know sometimes you need to make really shocking statments like Jesus did<br>
(eat my flesh, drink my blood) in order to get people to look behind the <br>
superficials. Of couse whenever you do some will always write you off and<br>
have nothing to do with you any more, but I suppose thats the cost.<br>

The discussion on Bible translations in recent SDAnet<br>
messages brings to mind a discussion I had with one of the local<br>
OT linguistic scholars. He said:<br>
<p>
"The facts are that by the time of Christ there were at least<br>
three Hebrew resencions or variant textual copies. The Greek<br>
translation which became the (OT) bible of the New Testament world<br>
was amde from one of them by Jews living in Alexandria in Egypt.<br>
In Jeremiah that text was 20% shorter and more reliable than the <br>
longer text used for our English Bibles.<br>
<p>
"God Breathed" But like the 1611 edition of the KJV, that included<br>
the apocryphal books and others. Well, even though not everything<br>
in them was correct, Paul and John for example, still used those<br>
books. So what was there view of inspiration. It certainly<br>
wouldn't be verbal."<br>
<p>
The inspiration of scripture must surely transend any individual<br>
translation. I find comparisons of translations interesting,<br>
not because one is more inspired than another, but<br>
because it reflects on what others think is important.<br>
<p>
An interesting exercise to try and rewrite a piece of scripture<br>
in your own words. The result may not be inspired but it can <br>
be inspiring.<br>

Hi there Tim<br>
<p>
Wow - that was quick - of course the time difference is just right now - I'm<br>
on my way home, and you have just come in - i suppose!<br>
<p>
Yes - please put me on the net - It looks good.  I'm all for using new<br>
technology for spreading the message within and without.<br>
<p>
Feel free to e-mail on any other query about this side of the world - and<br>
even just a personal Hi.<br>
<p>
About HBC and e-mail.  It's just a question of Beurocracy I think.  I have<br>
organized with our DP manager that they can link up with a phone link (typically daily)<br>
if they supply a modem here - and there of course.  But money is rather tight<br>
and the brethren probably have not seen the power of e-mail etc yet.  I think<br>
I will have to organize a demo and get the bug to byte.  I'll have to<br>
get you on the other side for a skeduled connection to really impress them!<br>
But today's turnover time is difficult to beat - and that not arranged!<br>
<p>
Well all the best - and God bless in your NET work there.  As I say, I'll be<br>
more than delighted to subscribe.<br>
<p>
Yes, NAC is a cyclotron with a small vd Graaff at FAURE near Somerset West.<br>
I'm situated at the vd Graaff, mostly using it as an analysis tool - I'm<br>
in solid state - spicifically silicides and related matters.  I spent some<br>
years lecturing after leaving Helderberg, but am in full time research at the<br>
moment.  I see you are also in Physics - it would be nice to chat about <br>
that sometimes too.  We might be able to link up some time in the future, as I<br>
should be going on a Post-doc in a year or so.<br>
<p>
God Bless<br>
<p>

Hi Steve,<br>
I thought I might be able to help Jeff out on this one.  David Merling who is<br>
the Associate Director/Curator for the Horn Archeological Museum there at<br>
Andrews has just had two articles accepted by the Adventist Review for pub. on<br>
this very issue.  Dave has done a pretty thorough review of Ron Wyatt's book.<br>
<p>
In addition, I am in the process of getting a copy of Bill Shea's set of slides<br>
to Dave so he will have them available.  They are really good pictures of the<br>
Ron Wyatt site and the Andrews folks might want to take a look at them after he<br>
gets them.<br>
<p>
One of these days I would like to put together information on the geology of<br>
the ark site for Dave but I haven't been there and it's a little hard to do<br>
geology from pictures.<br>
Elaine<br>

Hi There<br>
<p>
In the recent NAAP I find some college addresses.  That's good news.  You<br>
also have this mail address listed for more information about overseas<br>
colleges.  Well - I would like all the info you can give me - and in return<br>
I can give a little bit!<br>
<p>
I am at a research institution (similar to the Loma Linda Proton facility)<br>
near to Helderberg College in South Africa.  Even though I am not currently<br>
directly connected to HBC lecture-wise - I have a lot of friends there and<br>
have regular contact with them there.  A few guys and I are working on<br>
getting HBC up on the e-mail network via my work here, but that seems to be<br>
quite a way in the future - unfortunately!<br>
<p>
But as for now - I would be happy to pass on mail (within reason naturally)<br>
for guys there.<br>
<p>
You might mention this fact in your information on overseas colleges.<br>
<p>
I am actually trying to contact a few guys over there - but am a bit lazy to<br>
write - and too poor to phone for their e-mail addresses.  You wouldn't<br>
maybe have the addresses of the following:<br>
<p>
Dr A.O. Coetzee - Andrews<br>
Dr K.E. Thomas - Andrews<br>
Dr Will Clarke - La Sierra (if I remember correctly)<br>
Mr Gary Foster - Loma Linda<br>
<p>
It's nothing serious, or else I would have written naturally, but I would<br>
like to be able to contact them periodically via e-mail.<br>
<p>
I hope I hav'nt given you too much work!<br>
<p>
Maranatha<br>
<p>
Cecil Churms<br>
<p>
P.S.  Andrews doen't maybe have an anonymous FTP database of SDA-type stuff,<br>
like EGW on disk etc?  If it doesn't - it might be a good idea!  If it does,<br>
I would love to support it!<br>
<p>
Regards<br>
<p>
Cecil<br>
<p>
PPS.  I just remembered - I didn't ask for an address of some Physics guys at<br>
Andrews.  Any addresses available - I would like to contact them on a more<br>
professional level!<br>
<p>
Thanks<br>

I was about to send out a message to SDAnet that George Parry had joined<br>
to become our 150th member (not counting the 17 who read the digest)<br>
when Cynthia Helms message arrived, making her the 151st.  People are <br>
joining so fast that I can't keep up with the changes in the directory <br>
to get it out.  But it will come out soon.<br>

Mark Finley, SDA evangelist and speaker for the It Is Written television <br>
broadcast, has been here in the west suburbs of Chicago giving a series<br>
of meetings.  This is one of the first times that I have seen an SDA<br>
evangelist give first and only priority to presenting "Jesus Christ<br>
and him crucified."  It's called the Discover Jesus seminar, five nights<br>
of two 45-minute lessons apiece.  He begins with evidence for the historical<br>
Jesus and the historicity of the Bible, moves to the basics of salvation<br>
and a relationship of Christ, then moves to the certainty and nature<br>
of the Christ who is coming again.  This set of meetings will be followed<br>
by a more extended set by the local pastors.<br>
<p>
They've rented a 600-seat meeting hall with overflow space of 300, <br>
and it has been full for the first three of the five nights.  Videos of <br>
this seminar will be available in May.  It is coordinated with a set of <br>
It Is Written television programs that have been airing over the past <br>
couple months.<br>
<p>
It's also interesting to hear his story of preaching the gospel inside<br>
what had been the congress hall of the Kremlin.  Evidently an It Is Written<br>
team is now on its way to Moscow and in a short time there will be a <br>
set of meetings in the Olympic Stadium of Moscow.  They expect to seat 20000<br>
using half of the stadium and have two sessions each day.  Obviously they<br>
can use our prayers right now.<br>

It's great to hear such things. I'll have to say special prayers for<br>
Mark Finley and all who are out there trying to spread the message!<br>
In times like these, people need to know that there is Someone out<br>
there who knows they're hurting and is waiting to release them from<br>
their pain and love them.<br>

 I read the letter from C. Mervyn Maxwell the other day.  He seemed to see an<br>
 atack against conservatism in the attack on the independent ministers.  <br>
 <br>
 He talked about the magazine Spectrum.  I have heard of it, but he talked of <br>
 that magazine writing the view that the beasts were social ills and that<br>
 the remnant were social activists.  Does anyone know about this.  I have<br>
 never subscribed to the magazine.  Does it routinely print such things that <br>
 are so far out of adventist thought?<br>

My family has been watching a series of creation videos.<br>
A few points worth mentioning.<br>
<p>
* First landing on the moon.  Recall the big pads on the langer and<br>
  large wheels on the rover.  Scientists had calculated that space<br>
  dust would have built up to a softly packed depth of 45 to 600<br>
  feet (my numbers may be off a bit).  There was only about 1/4 inch<br>
  which adds up to about 6,000 years.<br>
<p>
* Population growth models back up to about 4,500 years ago and not<br>
  millions of years ago.<br>
<p>
* The earth's magnetism has a half life of 1400 years.  That works<br>
  back nicely a few thousand years but not millions of years.<br>
<p>
* The large flying dinosaurs could not have flown in our atmosphere.<br>
  Atmosphere must have been over X2 density.<br>
<p>
* Dinosaur cardiovascular system could not have supported much activity<br>
  in our atmosphere.  Must have had X2+ density and more oxygen.<br>
<p>
* Plants and animals lower in the column have counterparts that are<br>
  similar or same as today -- club moss today 6 to 8 inches and<br>
  club moss back then 60 to 80 ft.  A superior atmosphere would<br>
  explain it.<br>
<p>
* Hospitals today that have hyperbaric chambers -- X2+ pressure and<br>
  higher oxygen -- result in much faster healing rates.<br>
<p>
* Skipping a lot of the detail, anyway, explains how pre-flood man<br>
  could live 800, 900 years in the pre-flood context.  Well, one<br>
  example of a Japanese scientist growing a giant tomato that has<br>
  lived 7+ years, over 30 ft tall, a few thousand tomatoes on it.<br>
<p>
* They are trying to get funding to build a hyperbaric biosphere<br>
  in which to experiment.<br>
<p>
* Scientists documenting that light slows ("gets tired") and red shifts.  <br>
  Method of calculating stars way out there millions of light years,<br>
  by red shift theory, appears to be flawed.  Accounting for this<br>
  new red shift theory, stars are not as far away as previously<br>
  calculated.<br>

[I can't complain about these creation posts, because I started this thread.<br>
I don't like to destroy people's faith, but also I don't like to see them<br>
build their faith on the rubbish of charlatans.  In particular the <br>
"speed of light decay" stuff is the most contrived set of figures you have <br>
seen.  The work of the professor has been repudiated even by several <br>
of the creationist think tanks.  It involves going back to the earliest<br>
measurements in the 1600's with higher errors and slightly higher values,<br>
and fitting an incredulous function with no knowledge of the parameters<br>
that would make it significant.  Those creation advocates who insist on<br>
spouting discredited arguments are their own worst enemies.  I do not<br>
mean<br>
to say that all the arguments given above are spurious, some of them are not.<br>
But I do believe there is a great need for integrity of scientific method <br>
in the work of creation research.  The SDA Geoscience Research Institute<br>
has been more cautious than most in this regard, and it seems that they <br>
are making a genuine effort to support real scientific research nowadays.<br>
Two of their scientists are members of SDAnet.  SCT]<br>

I read some of the discussion on the Christia mailing list.  One Adventist<br>
said that Adventists do not believe Jesus can live perfectly in you.  I do not<br>
believe that is a true statement.  Some adventists believe that and some<br>
adventists do not.  I did not want to question the statement on that general<br>
mailing list because I did not think it was the place or the time to have<br>
adventists disputing one another.<br>
<p>
I, for one, do not believe that Christ in the believer is folly.<br>
<p>
thank you<br>

<i>	&gt;This perpetuates the common SDA fallacy that there is nothing between</i><br>

<p>
Thanks Terry for your viewpoint.  I tend to be on this end of the scale <br>
in a general<br>
social setting.  Socializing with people where there is alcohol is not <br>
the same as<br>
showing up in bars with them.<br>
<p>
Funny thing, a few Saturday nights ago, I went out - for the first time <br>
- with a particular<br>
set of friends who are not Christian, GASP.  After watching a movie <br>
which dealt with a<br>
day in late winter, a crazy guy and a prairie animal... achem, said <br>
friends and I were<br>
deciding on a nice place to sit and chat.  One friend rattle off about <br>
the closest bars in<br>
the area.  They both obviously had done the bars.  I cringed at the <br>
thought...<br>
"Someone'll see me there!  There's _got_ to be some other place, we can <br>
talk the<br>
hours away."<br>
<p>
And there was.  Just as I was gearing to set the limits as to where we <br>
were going to<br>
drink and talk, the other friend spoke up that a bar wouldn't be a good <br>
place.<br>
The reasoning?  Not because of the smoke, or severely inebriated people, but<br>
because of Marcus.  This friend said that we should meet at a place <br>
which fit my<br>
lifestyle.  I've seen it happen over and over, as I socialize with <br>
people and show them<br>
that people who don't drink, smoke, or do drugs, aren't just little old <br>
ladies with scarves<br>
on their silver-haired heads.<br>
<p>
In addition, I learn that not all people who drink alcohol are addicts. <br>
 But I've not included<br>
this (light drinking) into my list of "optionals", regarding serious <br>
dates, and future spouse.<br>
Any of you married types felt the same when you were single?<br>

Hi Steve<br>
<p>
I was glad to read your comments about the caution we should show with respect<br>
to the quality of the evidence we cite as supporting our beliefs.  I have<br>
unfortunately often been embarrassed when listening to evidence cited to<br>
support theories in which I believe, but which I know are not based on sound<br>
scientific (or hermaneutic) principles.<br>
<p>
One GOOD piece of evidence is worth one hundred shaky ones.<br>
<p>
One shaky piece of evidence can do untold harm in discrediting all the good<br>
evidence with which it is associated.<br>
<p>

<p>
I have seen these videos, too.  I have the feeling that they make a<br>
number of valid points supporting creation.  However, any valid<br>
information seems to be well hidden amongst the speculation and<br>
fallacious reasoning.  For instance,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; * Population growth models back up to about 4,500 years ago and not</i><br>
<i>&gt;   millions of years ago.</i><br>
<p>
Extrapolating population growth models back many thousands of years is<br>
valid only if you assume that ALL the other variables remain constant,<br>
such as political conditions, environmental conditions, birth rates,<br>
mortality rates, etc.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; * The earth's magnetism has a half life of 1400 years.  That works</i><br>
<i>&gt;   back nicely a few thousand years but not millions of years.</i><br>
<p>
They totally ignore evidences for multiple reversals of the earth's<br>
magnetic field, implying that the earth's magnetism varies cyclicly<br>
rather than as an exponential decay.<br>
<p>
The arguments regarding the hyperbaric biosphere seem intriguing, but<br>
I am not qualified to judge whether they are valid.<br>

The search for a new president for La Sierra University started with the<br>
announcement in September by president Fritz Guy that he would end his term of<br>
service at the end of this school year.  The search committee chaired by<br>
trustee Jerry Wiley (faculty/administration of the USC law school), got off<br>
to a slow start and has clothed their activities in secrecy. Wiley has been<br>
said to have the committee on a short leash and a muzzle.  LSU provost,<br>
Garland Dulan has been removed from the committee for giving general and vague<br>
information to the campus about the work of the committee.  The secrecy<br>
makes the following information all the more interesting.<br>
<p>
Authoritative information coming from off campus indicates that the leading<br>
candidates for the position are the presidents of AUC, PUC, and WWC<br>
(Gerity, Maxwell and Andreasen).  The information has further interest in<br>
that the three appear to have been selected before Wiley sent letters<br>
asking the fifty-one individuals nominated by the university faculty and<br>
administration if they would consider the position.  Gerity is now said to be<br>
coming to the campus for interviews this coming week.<br>
<p>
Stay tuned.<br>

<i>&gt; Subject: Re: Gentry's halos </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My family has been watching a series of creation videos.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A few points worth mentioning.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * First landing on the moon.  Recall the big pads on the langer and</i><br>
<i>&gt;   large wheels on the rover.  Scientists had calculated that space</i><br>
<i>&gt;   dust would have built up to a softly packed depth of 45 to 600</i><br>
<i>&gt;   feet (my numbers may be off a bit).  There was only about 1/4 inch</i><br>
<i>&gt;   which adds up to about 6,000 years.</i><br>
<p>
Other scientists thought otherwise, the "dust sea" idea wasn't expected<br>
to be highly likely even before the first Apollo landings (and Surveyor<br>
hadn't sank, either, on landing).<br>
<p>
One thing that most hadn't banked on before the landings was vacuum<br>
welding...many things brought in contact in vacuum eventually weld together.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; * Population growth models back up to about 4,500 years ago and not</i><br>
<i>&gt;   millions of years ago.</i><br>
<p>
Assumes constant growth rates...isn't this a form of uniformitarianism<br>
that creationists have railed against?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; * The earth's magnetism has a half life of 1400 years.  That works</i><br>
<i>&gt;   back nicely a few thousand years but not millions of years.</i><br>
<p>
I'd like to see the reference for this one.  (Other evidence suggests that<br>
the magnetic field periodically reverses itself.)  Extrapolating current<br>
trends too far?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; * The large flying dinosaurs could not have flown in our atmosphere.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Atmosphere must have been over X2 density.</i><br>
<p>
Why not?  The biggest ones were about the size of a good-performing hang<br>
glider.  They seem to fly pretty well, without *any* power input from the<br>
pilot, given reasonable wind conditions.  I'd want a reference on this<br>
one, too.<br>
<p>
Paul MacReady (sp), whose team built the first successful man-powered aircraft,<br>
built (and flew) a radio-controlled pterodactyl for the Smithsonian a couple of<br>
years back.  It used some wing-flapping, but otherwise wasn't powered...come to<br>
think of it, I'm not absolutely sure about the flapping.  But it did perform<br>
adequately.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; * Scientists documenting that light slows ("gets tired") and red shifts.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;   Method of calculating stars way out there millions of light years,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   by red shift theory, appears to be flawed.  Accounting for this</i><br>
<i>&gt;   new red shift theory, stars are not as far away as previously</i><br>
<i>&gt;   calculated.</i><br>
<p>
I thought that "tired light" was on pretty shakey grounds...<br>
<p>
It's too easy to make a video tape with all sorts of claims on it,<br>
but I'd like to see a *lot* better evidence that the claims have merit.<br>
<p>
sorry.<br>

When I was in denominational Jr. Academies I learned many things.<br>
One of the things that stuck with me was an acronym to remember some of the<br>
beliefs of the Adventist Church.  I learned this at Cedarvale Jr. Academy in<br>
Raytown MO  The Acronym was BROTHER and 8 S-es:<br>
<p>
Baptism by Immersion<br>
Religious Liberty<br>
Ordanances - Lords Supper, <br>
Tithe and Offerings<br>
Health and Temperance<br>
End of the Wicked<br>
Rightousness by Faith<br>

Sin<br>
Second Coming<br>
Sabbath<br>
Sanctuary<br>

Since we're discussing science in this group, I'd like to make a<br>
different kind of comment.  According to Science Magazine, toads<br>
and frogs seem to be disappearing all over the world, for some<br>
unknown reason.  However, this isn't true in North Carolina.<br>
Two days ago, my children came home with a plastic container full<br>
of over 90 toads, chirping loudly away.  Yesterday they caught<br>
215 of them.  (All but a few were quickly repatriated.)  When<br>
you see a boy with 90 toads you know that the Lord has a sense<br>
of humor.<br>

Thanks for forwarding the letter.<br>
<p>
Please someone tell me about the 7 papers written by honor students at<br>
Walla Walla College in the Spring of 1991.  Maxwell refered to this in his<br>
letter.  He said that Elder Falkenburg reproved the religion Faculty at<br>
the college.<br>
<p>
Thank You,<br>

 He talked about the magazine Spectrum.  I have heard of it, but he talked of <br>
 that magazine writing the view that the beasts were social ills and that<br>
 the remnant were social activists.  Does anyone know about this.  I have<br>
 never subscribed to the magazine.  Does it routinely print such things that <br>
 are so far out of adventist thought?<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I haven't read Spectrum much either, and haven't come across the ideas<br>
mentioned here. But I would like to point out that the authors who submit<br>
material to Spectrum are indeed Adventists, so it is incorrect to say that<br>
those views are far out of Adventist thought. Besides, how can a person<br>
develop in their ideas if they never entertain new ones? Is the printing<br>
of a new idea equivalent to endorsing that idea as undisputed truth?<br>

In the ongoing discussion on the CHRISTIA list, I find it amazing that <br>
none of the SDA's who were posting, (including myself, Ruben, Tony,<br>
and Noe Torres, who just joined the net) flamed each other, although<br>
we were really expressing rather divergent points of view.  <br>
<p>
It's interesting that although the critics on the liberal side have <br>
been loud and vocal, no liberal offshoot has emerged, and there is no <br>
immediate threat of one.  Nor do church administrators seem to take<br>
this threat anywhere near as seriously as the threat of a conservative<br>
offshoot.  In fact, people such as Desmond Ford and Walter Rea still <br>
hold membership in the SDA church, though they are by no means active.<br>
<p>
I think this has to do with the nature of the liberal arguments<br>
than anything else.  Whoever it was that suggested the beasts of Daniel 7<br>
were social ills didn't say "This is the One True Interpretation<br>
and those who disagree are Antichrist."  They merely suggested that this <br>
is another idea that can be drawn from that passage.  This is the <br>
way many of these arguments are made, not negating the other argument,<br>
but just putting out an alternative interpretation.  Desmond Ford was<br>
an exception to this in that he said not only his new theory, but<br>
also that the SDA doctrine was wrong.  <br>
<p>
The liberal arguments force us to think about what would we do if the <br>
knowledge we base our beliefs on were shown to be wrong.  If carried to <br>
the extreme, it forces us to look at the bare bones of our faith to see<br>
what are the really necessary things for belief.  Often when attacks<br>
on the faith come, we defend on a line of defense that is inaccurate<br>
or indefensible.  I am impressed by those who are able to yield almost<br>
every point put forth by the liberals, and yet maintain their faith.<br>
<p>
I am not comfortable making some of the liberal arguments myself, so I <br>
tend to find a group that is liberal enough so that I can be a conservative.<br>
Fortunately these groups are in large supply.  <br>

DONT INCLUDE (light drinking).  If you don't drink, make SURE your<br>
mate doesn't also.  From my experience there are several major issues that <br>
you absolutly have to have resolved.  Make SURE that you are both settled<br>
as to whether you want kids or don't.  I don't want anything to do with<br>
kids.  Have never really wanted anything to do with kids. My wife desperately<br>
wants kids.  Before we got married, we decided that we would adopt after<br>
7 years.  Well it is nearly 10 years, and I still don't want kids.  Over<br>
the years of dealing with my sister-in-law and her kids, I have come to the<br>
conclusion that kids just don't fit with my lifestyle.  This is an underlying<br>
stress in our marriage, though it has not caused any major problems.  I <br>
suspect that we will be adopting in the next couple of years, but it will be<br>
a 6 to 9 year old.  I have many and varied reasons, some of which include<br>
the state of the current world.  (I feel it is morally wrong to add another<br>
mouth to the worlds burden, and bring up a kid in this current enviorment).<br>
To me, it is also the ultimate act of selfishness, when there are lots of <br>
kids who don't have a home or family, to bring a child into the world.  There<br>
are other considerations also, such as the fact that I have a low tolerance<br>
to stupid people.  If I created anything less than a above average IQ child<br>
I would really have problems.  A birthdefect would really sink me.  I could<br>
not handle it.  <br>
<p>
Another thing to get straight (it is critical) is how money is handled, and<br>
how decisions are handled.  In our marriage, Marilyn and I have decided that the<br>
person most affected has the final word in decisions.  This goes for purchasing<br>
decisions as well as other ones.  This model works well. <br>
<p>
Additionaly, resolve who fixes the pineapple. ???????????!!!!!!!!!!1??????????<br>
<p>
Yep, think about this.  This is a true story.  We got married in 1983 and<br>
moved to Austin shortly thereafter.  I went to work for Motorola as thier<br>
first software application engineer.  We were starting out, and so to make<br>
the budget stretch, we furnished our house from flea-markets and garage-sales.<br>
(I LOVE flea-markets).  Anyway, we found a really great deal on dead-ripe<br>
pinapples one day.  .50 each.  I bought 6 of them.  We lined them up on the<br>
kitchen counter.  And that is where they sat.  one spoiled, and got thrown<br>
away. Another one spoiled and got thrown away. and so on.  Finaly there were<br>
2 left, at which time I exploded. Periodicaly I would say, "why don't we<br>
have a pinapple tonight" to which Marilyn would say "that sounds good."<br>
During my explosion I demanded to know why she was just letting the pinapples<br>
rot down, and why SHE had not fixed them.  I was informed in a pleasant tone<br>
that peeling the pineapples was MY job. ??????????!!!!!!!!!<br>
It turns out that in my family my MOTHER always peeled and prepared the pine-<br>
apples, and in Marilyn's family her father always peeled and prepared the<br>
pineapples.  So here we were, waiting around for the other one to fix the<br>
pinapples, and they were rotting down.<br>
<p>
I got busy and fixed the pineapples.  However, the underlying core of this<br>
is people have differing role models, and you need to clearly define them<br>
and explore them first.<br>
<p>
Try to get to an engaged encounter or marriage enrichment seminar.  It will<br>
be worth your time.  Another thing that we did, was to pay a SDA marriage<br>
councilor many visits and much money (grin, the best 450.00 or so I've<br>
ever spent).  We went there with some minor problems to deal with, and<br>
discovered that there were some major ones we did not know about.  The man<br>
was invaluable in helping us deal with them, and work through them and<br>
without his help we never would have gotten married.  We are quite happily<br>
married, and have a much better than average relationship.<br>
<p>
Gotta go now, but perhaps I'll try to post our question list. For the first<br>
several years we set aside an hour or two every sunday to write down the<br>
answers to a list of 45 or so questions, then exchanged our answers and<br>
discussed them with each other.  It headed off blowups, pressures, etc. <br>
<p>
the habit slipped and we don't, do it any more. I think we are going<br>
to start doing it again.  It makes things go SO much easier...<br>
Cheers<br>
Woody<br>

      Did I read correctly where someone said that Ellen White is<br>
   mentioned in the Baptismal vows for SDAs ??<br>
<p>
   Eric Snyder<br>
[Someone certainly did say that, I believe it is true but don't have<br>
the copy to check.  The Baptismal vows are not uniformly administered<br>
anymore, however, some congregations require no vow at all. I am not sure<br>
what the status of the 13 Baptismal vows are with respect to the 27<br>
Fundamental Beliefs, which were adopted after I and many others were baptized.<br>

Pre script:<br>
Could everyone put a "SDA:" in front of their subject headings?  I get<br>
upwards of 50 mail messages a day and I (and I would guess others feel<br>
the same) would love to be able to identify SDANet mail traffic by looking<br>
at the subject heading.<br>
<p>
<p>
I would like to comment on the creation video that people have been<br>
discussing.<br>
<p>
I feel that the creation cause is really lacking in the way of good scientific<br>
evidence.  This video attempts to show that creation is really a scientific<br>
theory and that there are hosts of good data sets to back it up.  I have<br>
a real problem with saying something is science just because it sounds<br>
good.  The video made alot of claims, very few of which were backed up<br>
by published scientific papers. <br>
<p>
I am a biology student at Walla Walla<br>
College and I just finished a class called Philosophy of Origins and<br>
Speciation.  In that class we came upon less than ten, I repeat, less<br>
than ten published scientific papers that came to bear upon the current<br>
understanding of a scientific view of creation.  Perhaps there are thousands<br>
more papers that we did not see, but I would dare say that there are not<br>
very many scientific papers that support a short-term chronology.<br>
<p>
<p>
Creationists CANNOT claim that they have a "scientific" theory on the basis <br>
of ten or even 20 papers.  I think that we need to be honest with our<br>
evolutionist friends that science has not really been good to the creation<br>
cause.  This may simply be because there have been at least 10,000 times as<br>
many evolution researchers than creation researchers, or because the money<br>
spent on evolution research is probably at a ratio of  100,000 dollars to<br>
every one dollar spent on creation research.  BUT, that still does not give<br>
us as creationists the right to claim that we have as much scientific <br>
evidence as the evolutionists.  Creationists sometimes tend to speculate<br>
and then call that speculation science.<br>
<p>
I feel that creation must be taken on faith.  Sure, there is currently some<br>
scientific evidence for a young earth, but WE ARE NOT GOING TO BRING PEOPLE<br>
INTO THE SDA CHURCH BY "PROVING" TO THEM THAT GOD CREATED THE EARTH.  That<br>
we have to take by faith.  God and his miracles do not fit into science.  <br>
Science only operates on what we can see and our perceptions may be flawed.<br>

    He talked about the magazine Spectrum.  I have heard of it, but he talked of <br>
    that magazine writing the view that the beasts were social ills and that<br>
    the remnant were social activists.  Does anyone know about this.  I have<br>
    never subscribed to the magazine.  Does it routinely print such things that <br>
    are so far out of adventist thought?<br>

Since no one else familiar with Spectrum has replied to this let me<br>
try.  I read Spectrum regularly and am listed on the "Spectrum<br>
Advisory Board" or some such title - this means I contribute to it<br>
financially on a regular basis - not that I have anything to do with<br>
setting editorial direction.  Although I confess I sometimes get<br>
behind in my reading and cannot claim to have read every article, I do<br>
not recall any recent article advocating the views you meantion.<br>
<p>
But one thing should be kept in mind about Spectrum -- Spectrum is<br>
published by the Association of Adventist Forums, a group of SDA<br>
members but the organization has no official connection to the church<br>
organization.  And unlike most journals published by the church,<br>
Spectrum has no mission to get teach or push a particular point of<br>
view.  It does solicit some of its articles in order to cluster<br>
articles reflecting a number of viewpoints on a single subject into<br>
one issue, but most of the articles are contributed unsolicited.  Its<br>
mission is to provide a forum (hence the name of the organization) for<br>
discussion of various viewpoints.  It tries to include both<br>
traditional viewpoints as well as those that challange traditional<br>
views.  Most authors are sympathetic to SDA tradition and strong<br>
believers in the SDA church but think that we do not have all the<br>
truth yet and must keep seeking better understanding by considering<br>
and reconsidering the details of our belief - not the fundamentals but<br>
the details (of course not all can agree on the separation of<br>
fundamentals and details).<br>
<p>
But my main point is that NO article or viewpoint reflects a position<br>
of the journal.  Its mission is to air many viewpoints, so it has no<br>
single consistent viewpoint.  There may occationally be an article<br>
that you would consider "far out of adventist thought" -- this<br>
challanges us to defend our traditions and often the same issue will<br>
contain other articles doing precisely that.<br>

There have been many times in the course of SDAnet where I have thought <br>
a position was unsupportable, or perhaps didn't know the reason behind<br>
a particular interpretation.  Time after time people have come through and <br>
shown that there is scriptural backing or historical evidence or both for a<br>
particular position.  While the liberals are trying to point out that our <br>
faith would still stand even if a particular point of interpretation<br>
were not true, the conservatives march ahead and show that is true. <br>
Biblical <br>
Archeology is not dominated by those considered conservative in the SDA<br>
church, but those archeologists who have maintained belief in the truth<br>
of the Bible continue to find evidence of its authenticity.<br>
<p>
Sometimes theirs is a thankless task, witness Wieland and Short who had to<br>
pound away for twenty years or more before they got any attention, and<br>
then it was an attack.  (It's interesting that in 1888 Waggoner and<br>
Jones were considered "Liberals" by the establishment of the time.  What<br>
does this say<br>
about the direction of the motion of the establishment?)<br>
<p>
Fortunately, the structure of the SDA church is that if you have a conviction<br>
about truth, and shout loudly enough for long enough, some people will look<br>
past the messenger to the message, and listen.  Conservatives, please keep <br>
shouting!  We love you, PROOF BY CAPS LOCK and all.<br>

Following on what Steve had to say.<br>
<p>
A big plus I find in SDAnet is that we talk about issues and get<br>
away with it.  If a Sabbath School class at my church was to say<br>
the same things, by way of discussions, as are discussed on SDAnet, <br>
there would be some serious rumblings coming down from church<br>
leadership.  I am a conservative in a conservative SS class in a<br>
largely liberal church.  Our SS leader has to be careful to steer<br>
the class away from certain discussions and back to the lesson<br>
outline and even then he gets invited in for confrontations with<br>
the SS committee and/or the church pastors.  To openly discuss<br>
some of what I have posted would have shut down our class a long<br>
time ago.<br>
<p>
And so I appreciate the forum of SDAnet.<br>
<p>

During the war my home church also had lengthy prayers, services, etc. concernin<br>
   g the war.  I was relieved though that a number of people made clear that sid<br>
   e<br>
taking was not the issue and shouldn't be the issue in war time, but the issue<br>
should be that the destruction ends as swiftly as possible, for wars are<br>
battles of principalities and powers between good and evil and not between men.<br>
God is the author and basis of life and peace, not confusion and destruction<br>
that as is often associated with war.<br>
Also, several Sabbaths, information was passed on concerning the church in<br>
Baghdad.  Word had reached the US for the NAD churches to pray for their<br>
welfare, if I'm not correct, they fared miracously well.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hallo Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt; I need for another time your help. </i><br>
<i>&gt; I need the email address of the OFFICE OF GLOBAL MISSION </i><br>
<i>&gt; in Silver Spring (if they are connected to a net).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thousand thanks for your help.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Siegmar</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I just returned from a trip to Washington, DC, and while there paid a<br>
visit to the GC.  I'll report on issues related to the net later when<br>
I've caught up a bit.  Among other things, I picked up a so-called SDA<br>
E-Mail Directory (more on that later).  It appears to be mostly ATT Mail<br>
addresses (no Internet ones that I can see), and it is also in no<br>
discernible order.  The list is 4 pages long (I also got a<br>
machine-readable copy which I hope to be able to figure out a way to<br>
post to the list).  For GC Global Mission I see M.Ryan/H.Butler listed<br>
for Global Mission Portable Computer 1--A11111GLOBAL.  I also see one<br>
for Mike Ryan, GC Global Mission Coordinator--A11111GLOCOR.  For<br>
Internet access, I understand that one uses the ATT account (user ID)<br>
followed by @attmail.com.  I have used this for Carlos Medley at the<br>
Adventist Review, and it works.  It appears that the GC ATT accounts all<br>
start with A followed by 5 1's.  Next week I'll try to follow this up<br>
with the actual list, plus some discussion of some issues I see<br>
associated with this.<br>
<p>
Harvey Brenneise<br>
Head Reference Librarian<br>
Andrews University<br>
(brneise@andrews.edu)<br>
[Harvey is correct, all AT+T accounts can be reached by sending to <br>
userid@attmail.com  The three issues I see are these:  (1), can Internet<br>
access be gotten by some cheaper means than attmail?  (2) If we put these <br>
GC officers on SDAnet and deluge their accounts with E-mail, might this<br>
turn them off from E-mail altogether?  (3)  If people knew that high<br>
General conference leadership was listening, would the character of SDAnet <br>
change into a gripefest?  SCT]<br>

The idea of tagging all SDA subject lines with SDA: has been mentioned<br>
before.  On the surface it's a good idea, but<br>
<p>
1)  Not everyone will do it, therefore<br>
2)   I would have to add it<br>
3)   That's a royal pain.<br>
<p>
Sorry!<br>
<p>
<p>
Those on Unix machines who find this a problem, I would suggest<br>
investigating the Elm mailer.  This can automatically sort SDAnet<br>
messages from other <br>
messages.  If you have elm at your site, I can send you a set of filter <br>
rules that will do that.<br>

You should have noticed that over the past week, the messages have been<br>
sent out in a single bunch each day.  Every day except today that was<br>
in the evening Central Standard Time, which means the Australians can get a<br>
fast reply in while I am still posting.  The dual goal was to slow down <br>
traffic somewhat and to keep at least most of the readership from having mail<br>
hitting their terminal during work hours.  Also;, it saves me some time.<br>
Sometimes I lose track of what messages have been sent out already, though,<br>
and as a result send them out twice.<br>
<p>
Let us know what else can be done to improve service.<br>

Last week I questioned another persons defense of Adventism on the CHRISTIA<br>
mailing list.  He showed me that I jumped to a conclusion.  I read him wrong<br>
Ihe did not question the position  of Christ living in you perfectly.  I<br>
think I got mixed up by semantics.  I am even more happy I did not question him on that list.  I am sorry for any problems my actions may have caused.<br>

At the recent field conferences that the Geoscience Research Institute held in<br>
Australia and New Zealand, we included one lecture on pitfalls to avoid.<br>
Included in that were: pleochroic halos, change in the speed of light, claims<br>
for discovery of Noah's ark, and Paluxy River footprints. The lecture was split<br>
up between three of us. We completely agree with Cecil's comment that "One<br>
shaky piece of evidence can do untold harm in discrediting all the good<br>
evidence with which it is associated." <br>
<p>
-------------------------------------- <br>
<p>
comments on: Decay in the Speed of Light suggested by Trevor Norman and<br>
Barry Setterfield. This has been discussed at length by several conservative<br>
creation groups that would like this evidence, but don't find it convincing.<br>
<p>
---Gerald E. Aardsma, "Has the Speed of Light Decayed?", Institute for Creation<br>
Research, Impact No. 179 (May 1988).<br>
---D. Russell Humphreys, "Has the Speed of Light Decayed Recently?", Creation<br>
Research Society Quarterly, vol. 25, p.40-45 (June 1988).<br>
---Maurie G. Evered / Alan Montgomery / Trevor Norman, (several articles),<br>
Creation ex Nihilo Technical Journal, vol. 5 (part 2), p. 94-122 (1991).<br>
<p>
They make several points:<br>
(1)	Setterfield made a least squares fit to the data, but not weighted by<br>
the errors for each point. Weighting the oldest data points by their large<br>
errors would significantly decrease their importance. <br>
(2)	Setterfield corrected some of the old data; however, other old data<br>
that fit his theory were not corrected. <br>
(3)	It has been noted in general that scientific measurements done over<br>
many years do approach today's accepted value from one side. This is just due<br>
to psychology - scientists don't want their new measurements to be too much<br>
different from the previous measurements. <br>
(4)	According to Setterfield, not only is the speed of light decaying, but<br>
in addition, the rate of decay has been decreasing. "Fortuitously," this rate<br>
of decrease has only recently become too small to measure, when technically it<br>
would be possible. A quote from Humphreys, "Why should the rate of change of c<br>
diminish in direct proportion to our ability to measure c more accurately?" <br>
<p>
-------------------------<br>
<p>
comments on decay of earth's magnetic field:<br>
--- note the following abstract<br>
<p>
	The earth has possessed a magnetic field for most of its history. It is<br>
therefore strange that the present-day field is changing so rapidly: at the<br>
recent rate of decay the magnetic field will be removed altogether in the next<br>
1500 years.If this fall persists, as seems likely, our future magnetic<br>
environment would be quite different from that of today. A long term program of<br>
observation and development of theory for the origin of the magnetic field are<br>
needed in order to understand the processes influencing the magnetic field. <br>
---David Gubbins, "Geomagnetism: the next millenium," Palaeogeography,<br>
Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology (Global and Planetary Change Section), 89<br>
(1990) 255-262. {published by Elsevier}<br>
<p>
However, this type of evidence shouldn't be used to prove a recent creation as<br>
noted by <br>
---Ivan E. Rouse, "Paleomagnetism II," Origins, v.10, n.2, p.66-89 (1983).<br>
He notes three problems for Barnes free decay model:<br>
(1)	Magnetic age dating is more rigidly uniformitarian than the<br>
uniformitarianism of conventional geologists.<br>
(2)	Paleomagnetic intensity measurements indicate that the<br>
earth's magnetic field has been decreasing in intensity only in the last<br>
2800 years and more rapidly only in the last 800 years. {note the only}<br>
(3)	The equation developed for predicting past inensities of the earth's<br>
magnetic field is entirely arbitrary.<br>
<p>
------------------------<br>
<p>
I don't believe that the scientific evidence is overwhelming for a recent<br>
creation of life or Noah's world wide flood. However, much evidence can be fit<br>
into either a short-age or a long-age model and some evidence appears to fit<br>
better into a short time scale. For me, the GOOD evidence is sufficient to<br>
be comfortable with a short time scale for life on earth, without using the<br>
eye-catching "proofs" that people are so anxious for.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; You are brazenly suggesting that those reading the NIV are reading material</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thats for you to decide, all I have done is presented a simple hypthesis.</i><br>
<p>
By not denying this you are agreeing with it.  I think it very sad that someone would<br>
actually discourage people from using the Bible, regardless of the version.  I think<br>
we as Christians should be strongly encouraging Bible usage by all and not be<br>
concerned with whether this version or that is used just because the wording in a few<br>
places of one version doesn't say it the same way another version you prefer does.<br>
<p>
The examples you cited were trivial (IMHO) in that the wording was changed to clear<br>
up some old english.  But the main meaning was still there and unchanged when taken<br>
in context of the passages.  The phrases that you accused of being removed were<br>
removed because it is a phrase not used in today's english language...at least where<br>
I live.<br>
<p>
So if, for example, "in the flesh" is to be taken out due to its old english, what<br>
would you put in its place if YOU were re-writing the Bible text in question?  Any<br>
thing you state in reply I could accuse as being anti-christ because you have changed<br>
the all inportant phrase "in the flesh" to something else...but I won't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;.I believe there will be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lot of folks saved and in heaven who only knew and read the NIV or ASV, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; even the Living Bible (should I guess it's too heretical to even mention).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hey many will be saved who have kept Sunday all their lives too.</i><br>
<p>
Are you catagorizing those who read the NIV with those who are ignorant of and don't<br>
keep the Sabbath?  I am sorry but even my KJV does not say "thou shalt not read the<br>
NIV".  Reading the NIV is not equal to keeping Sunday in my mind.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You know sometimes you need to make really shocking statments like Jesus did</i><br>
<i>&gt; (eat my flesh, drink my blood) in order to get people to look behind the</i><br>
<i>&gt; superficials. Of couse whenever you do some will always write you off and</i><br>
<i>&gt; have nothing to do with you any more, but I suppose thats the cost.</i><br>
<p>
In spite of the pompous words, I still believe the NIV is just fine for people to<br>
read...(as is the KJV and the ASB and the RSV and the original Greek).  If they work<br>
for you then read them.<br>
<p>
How about spending your bandwidth time building up people's faith in the Word of God<br>
instead of trying to tear it down.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hallo Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt; I need for another time your help. </i><br>
<i>&gt; I need the email address of the OFFICE OF GLOBAL MISSION </i><br>
<i>&gt; in Silver Spring (if they are connected to a net).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thousand thanks for your help.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Siegmar</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I just returned from a trip to Washington, DC, and while there paid a<br>
visit to the GC.  I'll report on issues related to the net later when<br>
I've caught up a bit.  Among other things, I picked up a so-called SDA<br>
E-Mail Directory (more on that later).  It appears to be mostly ATT Mail<br>
addresses (no Internet ones that I can see), and it is also in no<br>
discernible order.  The list is 4 pages long (I also got a<br>
machine-readable copy which I hope to be able to figure out a way to<br>
post to the list).  For GC Global Mission I see M.Ryan/H.Butler listed<br>
for Global Mission Portable Computer 1--A11111GLOBAL.  I also see one<br>
for Mike Ryan, GC Global Mission Coordinator--A11111GLOCOR.  For<br>
Internet access, I understand that one uses the ATT account (user ID)<br>
followed by @attmail.com.  I have used this for Carlos Medley at the<br>
Adventist Review, and it works.  It appears that the GC ATT accounts all<br>
start with A followed by 5 1's.  Next week I'll try to follow this up<br>
with the actual list, plus some discussion of some issues I see<br>
associated with this.<br>
<p>
Harvey Brenneise<br>
Head Reference Librarian<br>
Andrews University<br>
(brneise@andrews.edu)<br>
[Harvey is correct, all AT+T accounts can be reached by sending to <br>
userid@attmail.com  The three issues I see are these:  (1), can Internet<br>
access be gotten by some cheaper means than attmail?  (2) If we put these <br>
GC officers on SDAnet and deluge their accounts with E-mail, might this<br>
turn them off from E-mail altogether?  (3)  If people knew that high<br>
General conference leadership was listening, would the character of SDAnet <br>
change into a gripefest?  SCT]<br>

Mail via Bitnet has been quite slow reaching me recently, sometimes a<br>
two-week delay.  Any SDA-L subscribers who need services and can<br>
reach me via SMTP  e.g.<br>
<p>
<p>
st0o@andrew.cmu.edu<br>
<p>
<p>
will get better service.<br>

Dave, I agree with you about the liberality of discussion on the SDA net. I <br>
pastor a small church (65 members) . We have 2 SS classes, one that leans <br>
to Conserv. and another class we call the collegiate class where anything <br>
goes! I am a member of the collegiate class and we want the class members <br>
to feel that they can express themselves without being labeled if you know <br>
what I mean!<br>
<p>
I do not think this is a bad thing because several members of the class has <br>
indicated that their relationship (christian experience) has really grown.<br>

Steve, I wonder if we have a clear cut definition of liberals at least? The <br>
founders of our country were considered liberal because they wanted <br>
freedoms for everyone. I think that the ones who are called liberals today <br>
(outside of the church that it), are more like socialists because they want <br>
to take away from some to give to others. <br>
<p>
I perceived  that Short, Wieland, etc were the liberals trying to get at <br>
the truth of 1888. The Conservatives I thought were the ones who were <br>
saying, we always have practiced Right. by faith and there never was a <br>
rejection of the message in 1888.<br>
<p>
I do not mean to be nitpicking!! That is just my perception. Of course <br>
Labels can be confusing some of the time!<br>
<p>
I gave Gary Russell your Internet address and he will probably joining one <br>
of these days. I was thinking he may wait till after he is moved to Calif. <br>
in June.<br>

Several people have asked about my signature line.  I am a flint-knapper<br>
(one of my hobbies).  That means I make stone tools like the native americans.<br>
Arrowheads, knives, spearpoints etc.etc.  These are made by knocking flakes<br>
off flint, obsidian, chert, jasper, agate etc. (any silicious, non-crystalline<br>
elastic material).  Usualy I use copper billets (it is easier to get than<br>
good antler, and works nearly as well), but I do use a lot of moose antler<br>
batons/billets, and a hammerstone now and then.  I work the flakes or the<br>
core into stone tools with precussion and pressure flaking.  Bone or antler<br>
makes good pressure flakers, but once again I prefer copper.  (I use both).<br>
Doing this produces a good deal of *VERY* sharp edges and flakes, and you DO<br>
get cut.  It is unavoidable.<br>
Cheers<br>

<i>&gt; If we put these </i><br>

<p>
There are ways of controlling email access in a managable fashion.<br>
As an extreme example, I believe the White House is now attached to<br>
various email networks (including the Internet).  However, their<br>
connection operates by having a droid print each message and forward it<br>
through the normal paper channels inside the White House, so it doesn't<br>
give any particular advantage (except perhaps cost and ease of use) to<br>
the email user.  This isn't necessarily the best way to do it, the point<br>
is that just because someone uses email doesn't mean that the whole<br>
world has unfettered access to them.  (Apparently the White House is<br>
examining ways to streamline the situation.)<br>
<p>
At any rate, it seems to me that there are ways in which they could be<br>
provided with SDAnet access without getting deluged with regular email.<br>
In the worst case, they could resort to clumsy devices like receiving<br>
SDAnet mail under one alias, and posting from another.  Any mail can<br>
received at the posting address can be sent to /dev/null (or maybe to a<br>
secretary, the mail-person, or whoever).  Given good filtering tools, it<br>
should be able to set up a much better arrangement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(3)  If people knew that high</i><br>
<i>&gt;General conference leadership was listening, would the character of SDAnet </i><br>
<i>&gt;change into a gripefest?</i><br>
<p>
We need to decide what we want SDAnet to be: our "hotline" to the GC,<br>
or the general discussion forum that it is now.  I would like to think<br>
that it would remain a free and open forum in which (almost) anything<br>
can be discussed, and if the GC wants to be in on that, then by all<br>
means, plug them in.  The question is whether we get a "them-and-us"<br>
mentality, or if it's merely them joining in to what we are already<br>
doing.  (See? I'm already referring to it in those terms.)  This would be<br>
influenced as much by what the GC people say on SDAnet, as by what we<br>
say about them.<br>
<p>
One of the distinct advantages of email over other discussion forums is<br>
that it is possible to conduct discussions in parallel, so if you don't<br>
like one, you can ignore it and stick to the ones you do like.  If the<br>
flames get too much, there are technical means for separating the<br>
discussions.  If people want the chance to flame the GC, maybe there's<br>
scope for a separate mailing list for that purpose.  (Any takers?)<br>
However, used wisely, SDAnet is a unique opportunity for them to at<br>
least listen in on some of the "grassroots" of the church population.<br>

As a Christian and a scientist, I too am a little disturbed by some of<br>
the "Creation Science" videos and publications that I see. Although I<br>
agree with most of what Brian said in his post, there is one small point<br>
I would like to comment on.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
I feel that creation must be taken on faith.  Sure, there is currently some<br>
scientific evidence for a young earth, but WE ARE NOT GOING TO BRING PEOPLE<br>
INTO THE SDA CHURCH BY "PROVING" TO THEM THAT GOD CREATED THE EARTH.  That<br>
&lt;---<br>
<p>
I may be wrong, but there seems to be an implicit assumption here that if<br>
God did indeed create the Earth, he did so by "recent creation", and that<br>
any other position denies the creatorship of God. Brian seems to have<br>
equated "young earth" with "creation" in this passage.<br>
<p>
I myself am *definitely* a creationist, but at this stage I find the<br>
evidence for a young earth very shaky. I don't see any inconsistency in<br>
my believing that God created everything, and at the same time my being<br>
unsure of the how, when, and how quickly. Forcing people to choose *between*<br>
positions that are not by nature mutually exclusive can have unfortunate<br>
results. (eg, was EG White inspired, or did she copy from other authors?)<br>

Whilst following some of the discussion on bit.listserv.christia, I noticed<br>
one remark which puzzled me somewhat. I quote:<br>
<p>
"In 1888, a couple of men barnstormed the church with the doctrine of<br>
Righteousness by Faith. This issue is still a diving (sic) teaching in the<br>
church today. What these men, mainly Waggoner and Jones, taught was a<br>
confusion of Protestant and Catholic theology, foreign to both, and friendly<br>
to none.<br>
<p>
They taught that man must still keep the OT law perfectly, but that Christ<br>
does it inside the believer. Some of you will agree with this, but it is<br>
folly and untrue"<br>
<p>
The main material I have read on 1888 is George Knight's book "From 1888 to<br>
Apostasy", along with some of the papers in the 1988 Ministry magazine issue.<br>
Does anyone know what this guy means by "a confusion of Protestant and <br>
Catholic theology" etc.? And was Waggoner &amp; Jones' message about law keeping?<br>
I got the impression that they were responding to a legalistic/perfectionistic<br>
swing within the church at that time, where people were getting their<br>
priorities a bit mixed up, focussing on law rather than on Christ.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Eric Snyder</i><br>
<i>&gt; [Someone certainly did say that, I believe it is true but don't have</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

I believe the vow refers to the Spirit Of Prophecy, not Ellen White<br>
specifically.<br>

Steve Timm:<br>
<p>
Steve, I have been using a baptismal form to prepare for baptism that I got <br>
from Jay Gallimore in Mich when he was v. Pres. It is called the summary of <br>
our beliefs. I quote:<br>
<p>
"The gifts of the Holy Spirit are given to the body of Christ as he <br>
chooses. They are given to enable the Christian and the church, to become <br>
effective wintesses for Jesus. The gift of prophecy, one of the most <br>
desirable gifts is one of the identifying marks of the remnant church. <br>
Seventh-day Adventists recognize that this gift was manifested in the life <br>
and ministry of Ellen G. White."  In this statement are a lot texts for <br>
support but I have left them out for brevity on the net. This essentially <br>
is what is found in the church manual because the above was adapted from <br>
the SDA church manual by the Northwest Ministries Training Center of the N. <br>
Pacific Union Conf.<br>
<p>
The Baptismal vows that you mention I go over with the candidate previous <br>
to the day of baptism. In the church service I usually mentioned those <br>
being baptized have been properly instructed in the teachings of our church <br>
etc.<br>
<p>

Baptismal vows have been prepared in different ways in different places.<br>
The ones in use in the Philippines added a promise to attend church Sabbath,<br>
Wednesday, and Friday.  It also had a line about promising to not marry an<br>
outsider.  I asked where they got that.  Everyone seemed to think that was<br>
the normal vow worldwide...  Adaptation--part of mission.<br>

Hi people,<br>
	Here are some useful promises for people with Sabbath problems, in<br>
case you know of any that do.<br>
<p>
-beng<br>
<p>
Ps 145:13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures<br>
through all generations. The LORD is faithful to all his promises and loving<br>
toward all he has made. (NIV)<br>
<p>
Ps 119:170 May my supplication come before you; deliver me according to your<br>
promise. (NIV)<br>
<p>
Isaiah 56:2 Blessed is the man who does this, the man who holds it fast, who<br>
keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it, and keeps his hand from doing any<br>
evil." (NIV) <br>
<p>
Isa 58:11-59:1 The LORD will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in<br>
a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a<br>
well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail. Your people will<br>
rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will<br>
be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings. "If<br>
you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on<br>
my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the LORD's holy day<br>
honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you<br>
please or speaking idle words,  then you will find your joy in the LORD, and<br>
I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the<br>
inheritance of your father Jacob." The mouth of the LORD has spoken. Surely<br>
the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear.<br>
(NIV) <br>
<p>
Ps 28:7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and<br>
I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I<br>
praise him. (KJV)<br>
<p>
1Jn 3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his<br>
commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Ps 119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Rev 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne,<br>
even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Mt 19:30 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.<br>
(KJV) <br>
<p>
1Pe 4:19 So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit<br>
themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Mt 10:28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the<br>
soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in<br>
hell. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Mt 10:39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life<br>
for my sake shall find it. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Ro 8:18 I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with<br>
the glory that will be revealed in us. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Gal 6:9 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will<br>
reap a harvest if we do not give up. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Heb 12:1-4 1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of<br>
witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so<br>
easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for<br>
us. 2 Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith,<br>
who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat<br>
down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3 Consider him who endured such<br>
opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.<br>
4 In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of<br>
shedding your blood. (NIV)<br>
<p>
Heb 13:5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with<br>
such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor<br>
forsake thee. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Heb 13:6 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not<br>
fear what man shall do unto me. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Heb 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Ps 119:165 Great peace have they who love your law, and nothing can make them<br>
stumble. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Ps 37:23-24 23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he<br>
delighteth in his way. 24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down:<br>
for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Jer 1:8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,<br>
saith the LORD. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Jer 1:9 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD<br>
said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. (KJV) <br>
<p>
1Cor 10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:<br>
but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are<br>
able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be<br>
able to bear it. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Mt 6:33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these<br>
things will be given to you as well. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Mt 6:34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about<br>
itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Heb 10:23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for<br>
he is faithful that promised;) (KJV) <br>
<p>
Ps 77:1 I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Ps 77:5-6 I thought about the former days, the years of long ago; I<br>
remembered my songs in the night. My heart mused and my spirit inquired:<br>
(NIV)<br>
<p>
Ps 77:10-20 Then I thought, "To this I will appeal: the years of the right<br>
hand of the Most High." I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will<br>
remember your miracles of long ago. I will meditate on all your works and<br>
consider all your mighty deeds. Your ways, O God, are holy. What god is so<br>
great as our God? You are the God who performs miracles; you display your<br>
power among the peoples. With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the<br>
descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah The waters saw you, O God, the waters<br>
saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed. The clouds poured down<br>
water, the skies resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth. <br>
Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the<br>
earth trembled and quaked. Your path led through the sea, your way through<br>
the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen. You led your people<br>
like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Isa 41:10 So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am<br>
your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my<br>
righteous right hand. (NIV) <br>
<p>
2 Chr 16:9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole<br>
earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect<br>
toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou<br>
shalt have wars. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Mt 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:<br>
for he shall save his people from their sins. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Ps 121:2 My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Ps 121:7 The LORD will keep you from all harm-- he will watch over your life;<br>
(NIV) <br>
<p>
Ps 119:165-166 Great peace have they who love your law, and nothing can make<br>
them stumble. I wait for your salvation, O LORD, and I follow your commands.<br>
(NIV)<br>
<p>
Isa 48:18 If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would<br>
have been like a river, your righteousness like the waves of the sea. (NIV)<br>
<p>
John 14:27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you<br>
as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.<br>
(NIV) <br>
<p>
John 16:33 "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.<br>
In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>
world." (NIV) <br>
<p>
Matt 10:32 "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him<br>
before my Father in heaven. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Phil 2:13 for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his<br>
good purpose. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Phil 4:13 I can do everything through him who gives me strength. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Romans 8:28 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those<br>
who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Romans 8:35-39 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble<br>
or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it<br>
is written: "For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as<br>
sheep to be slaughtered." No, in all these things we are more than conquerors<br>
through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life,<br>
neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any<br>
powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be<br>
able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>
(NIV) <br>
<p>
Joshua 1:5 No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your<br>
life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor<br>
forsake you. (NIV)<br>
<p>
1 Pet 4:12-13 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are<br>
suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice<br>
that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be<br>
overjoyed when his glory is revealed. (NIV)<br>
<p>
2 Cor 4:17 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an<br>
eternal glory that far outweighs them all. (NIV) <br>
<p>
Jas 1:2-5 2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of<br>
many kinds, 3 because you know that the testing of your faith develops<br>
perseverance. 4 Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature<br>
and complete, not lacking anything. 5 If any of you lacks wisdom, he should<br>
ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be<br>
given to him. (NIV)<br>

Again, I'm not "Bible scholar" but....<br>
<p>
Romans 1:26 says:<br>
	For this reason God gave them up to vile passions.<br>
	For even their women exchanged the natural use for<br>
	what is against nature.<br>
<p>
To get the full picture (context) we have to read all of chapter 1<br>
and on into chapter 3, where he crowns his thought with "there<br>
is non righteous, no, not one."(Rom 3:10)  In these chapters Paul<br>
seems to be painting a relationship between homosexual<br>
practices and idolatry (same as in OT).  Verses (26 and 27) come<br>
after a detailed description of a world  that "exchanged the truth of<br>
God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather<br>
than the Creator."  Again, as in the OT, the main issues seem to be<br>
lust, "unnaturalness," and, in verse 28, a desire to avoid<br>
acknowledgment of God.<br>
<p>
These verses, and in fact the entire Bible says nothing about<br>
the assumption that same-sex relationships can be "natural".<br>
So the Hawaii Marriage issue is too advanced.  Assumptions and facts<br>
at square ONE must fist be resolved.  I trust that all would agree that<br>
"homosexuals" (for the sake of this discussion) do not own the market<br>
on "exchanging the truths of God for a lie, or worshiping and serving<br>
created things rather than the Creator."  Paul seems to be headed in a<br>
different direction than "homosexual activity is sin, and that's that."<br>
<p>
I'm not prepared to say that all "homosexuals" are trying to avoid<br>
acknowledging God, through continuance of "unnatural" sexual<br>
activity.  Furthermore, I'm no more prepared to separate their sexual<br>
activity from their overall "personhood", than I am to do the same for<br>
"heterosexuals."  As our sexualities are only a part of our Whole Self<br>
(spiritual, mental, physical).  And since I don't know the whole story<br>
behind each "homosexual" person, I an not in position to judge.<br>
The "Church" which has traditionally done the least in the area of<br>
understanding, repeatedly seems the most poised to judge.<br>
<p>
The Church has practiced two approaches in its judgment of<br>
"homosexuals."  It has either tried to change them (see: Quest Learning<br>
Center/Colin Cook) or it has disfellowshiped them.  Granted that this<br>
is far less bloody than the pronouncement Leviticus places on them...<br>
but of course gay-bashing in the street has no connection to that coming<br>
from the pulpit - DOES it?<br>

We are celebrating 100 years of Adventist Education in South Africa this year.<br>
One of the main events is a "home-coming" week-end at Helderberg College <br>
from 20 May to 23 May.<br>
<p>
I'm sure some of you out there have had connections with Helderberg, or know of<br>
someone who has.<br>
<p>
In a similar way in which it is customary to send telegrams of congratulations<br>
I wonder if any of you would like to send a message to Adventists in general<br>
and Helderberg in particular over this weekend.<br>
<p>
I have arranged that I will pass on any such mail to the organisers of the<br>
weekend - and also to the alumni supper (Thursday night) where applicable.<br>
<p>
Anyone interested?<br>
<p>

It's interesting how persistent the rumor of the James White Library<br>
subscribing to _Playboy_ has been.  That rumor was around when I was a<br>
student in the early '70's.  In fact, when as a graduate student I had<br>
access to what was then the closed portion of the periodical stacks<br>
(spending hours reading microfilmed music reviews of the Metropolitan<br>
Opera), I spent some time (to no avail) seeing if I could fine said<br>
magazines.<br>
<p>
I have only learned a bit more of this story since coming back to the<br>
library as one of the librarians.  The James White Library does not now,<br>
nor has it ever subscribed to _Playboy_.  It is true that _Playboy_ has<br>
information in it that is not pornographic which might be useful in<br>
doing research.  It was because a specific student needed some of this<br>
information that the library obtained one (or possibly a few) rolls of<br>
the back issues of this magazine on microfilm much as we would obtain<br>
information on interlibrary loan.  This was never added to the<br>
collection.  It was made available to that student and kept in a<br>
non-public area.  At a much later date when there was evidence that it<br>
may have been viewed after hours (probably by a night watchman) it was<br>
discarded.<br>
<p>
The mission of the library supports the mission of the university.  One<br>
part of that mission is to make research materials available to the<br>
university community.  This was one way to accomplish that.  Another<br>
would have been interlibrary loan.  In the words of one of my esteemed<br>
library school professors (Lester Asheim), libraries should select<br>
materials that meet their mission rather than censor materials that<br>
might offend some users.  In the university working policy is a<br>
statement that the library supports the Library Bill of Rights of the<br>
American Library Association.  Part of that bill of rights is that we do<br>
not censor materials which we do not agree with.<br>
<p>
Because of that, the library owns many items which the library, the<br>
university, the church as an institution or individual church members<br>
might not agree with.  Not only does the library need to select (but not<br>
censor), but each individual needs to select materials appropriate for<br>
themselves without expecting that the library will censor (for everyone<br>
else) what they do not approve of.  The library owns materials on a wide<br>
variety of topics (religion, science, social issues, etc.) that some<br>
users don't agree with, and might even find offensive.  Users have the<br>
right to not use what they find distasteful, but not to censor it for<br>
others.  The library also does not act "in loco parentis."  Parents are<br>
responsible for what their children see or borrow.  A university library<br>
by definition has to take such a stance.  Too many Adventists appear to<br>
have gotten into a habit of "groupthink" where the group (or some<br>
members of the group) makes selection about what is appropriate, leaving<br>
the individual with little responsibility for their own selections.<br>
This applies to music, reading, cinema and other areas.  The library<br>
simply cannot operate this way.<br>
<p>
Now, lest anyone think we've got all kinds of wild things in the<br>
collection, our collection development policy specifically requires that<br>
the curricula of the schools drive the purchasing decisions.  We don't<br>
have a research interest in pornography, so don't need such magazines as<br>
_Playboy_.  It's also not indexed in the periodical indexes that our<br>
students commonly use.  We do have access to needed information it, or<br>
other magazines (e.g. _Rolling Stone_) as mentioned above.  _Playboy_ is<br>
and should be in other libraries that have other missions.  <br>
<p>
In closing, we emphasize the positive in selection rather than trying to<br>
find the negative (which is censorship).  I hope we don't get to the<br>
situation that exists at Brigham Young University, where members of the<br>
community come in an censor things themselves, even going to the lengths<br>
of cutting out individual microform frames.<br>

Hi all... yes, it's just me again...<br>
<p>
Ruben and Noe have mentioned the idea that some theological theories almost<br>
blame God for sin. The Bible seems fairly clear that God is ultimately <br>
responsible for everything that occurs. God certainly didn't need to provide<br>
an entry for sin and suffering, and he certainly doesn't have to allow it to<br>
continue. "Blame" isn't the correct word, but I think saying that God is<br>
ultimately responsible is fair enough.<br>
<p>
This does not lessen the fact that we continue to wilfully participate in evil<br>
and sin. But a belief system shouldn't be discounted if it makes God take the<br>
ultimate responsibility.<br>
<p>
Also, I've read some more of Priebe's material and I've come across his<br>
answer to the question: "If Christ and I both inherit the same evil desires<br>
and fallen nature, how could He remain sinless and yet I could not?"<br>
<p>
I'm not going to quote pages of text, I'm relying on you to remember what<br>
Priebe's position on evil, sin and human nature entails. Anyway, starting on<br>
page 54, last paragraph:<br>
<p>
"Many have wondered why we develop these propensities while Christ did not<br>
develop them. It must be admitted that this is the period of Christ's life<br>
(from birth to the age of accountability) about which we have very little<br>
information in the inspired writings. Therefore any conclusions must remain<br>
somewhat tentative. One suggestion is that the parents of Jesus took special<br>
care to guide the developing mind of the infant Jesus so that sinful <br>
propensities did not develop in Jesus. Another suggestion is that the ability<br>
to discern between right and wrong was present very early in the child Jesus<br>
and was exercised to prevent sinful propensities from developing. Another<br>
suggestion is that Christ was not intended to be an example to mankind as<br>
an infant; therefore events during His infancy are not relevant to issues in<br>
the great controversy. The solution that I favor is that because of the<br>
supernatural birth of Christ through the Holy Spirit, He was born much as<br>
we are reborn. Because the power of the Holy Spirit was directing His life<br>
from birth, He did not develop the sinful habit patterns or propensities<br>
which we develop from birth.<br>
<p>
        Deity quiescent<br>
        =====================================================<br>
CHRIST  <br>
        Fallen                         no sinful propensities<br>
        =====================================================<br>

"<br>
<p>
He does not explain the diagram, unfortunately! You would have to read more<br>
of the chapter to decide for yourself how well he makes this fit with the<br>
rest of his material. In my opinion it fits ok, but it takes some fancy<br>
footwork here and there!<br>

<i>&gt;    Has anyone heard of NLP (Neural-Linguistic Programming)?  I've just</i><br>
<i>&gt; heard a bit about it and would like to know if any of you have more </i><br>
<i>&gt; information about it?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; --John (jash@eecs.wsu.edu)</i><br>
<i>&gt; KB7ONG</i><br>
<p>
John:<br>
<p>
Depending on who you talk to, neurolinguistic programming (NLP for<br>
short) is either a) a merely descriptive term for how information is<br>
processed on the individual level, or b) proof positive that "Adventist<br>
pastors have been trained to use hypnosis in their visitations and<br>
counseling...transferring their knowledge to unsuspecting lay<br>
volunteers."  Those who hold to the latter view tend to belong to the<br>
GC-basher crowd; a recent John Osborne pamphlet alluded to the sinister<br>
uses of NLP on its cover.  Clearly, we're talking heavy stuff here.<br>
<p>
The plain, prosaic truth of the matter is this: Back in the 1970's, LEAD<br>
Consultants (an interdenominational training group) put together a<br>
pastoral visitation training manual with the title "A Laboratory School<br>
on Skills for Calling and Caring Ministries."  Since this didn't exactly<br>
flow off the tongue, the manual was referred to as "Lab I" for short.<br>
(Yes, there is a Lab II -- it's the instructor training manual).<br>
<p>
Since the denomination had no comparable material, some SDA ministers<br>
began using Lab I.  It was useful in that its emphasis was on helping<br>
discouraged ex-members -- those who had dropped out because of crises<br>
such as unemployment, death in the family, etc. -- return to church.<br>
The emphasis was not on doctrinal matters, an area where the<br>
denomination IS well-equipped.<br>
<p>
Buried within the 14 interpersonal listening skills presented was<br>
information on neurolinguistic programming.  The material was technical<br>
in  nature and dealt with the processing of information by individuals,<br>
and how each individual handles information flow.<br>
<p>
While this all sounds innocent enough, it set off alarms in certain<br>
quarters.  Part of the problem is that some organizations have claimed<br>
NLP is a cure-all that can cure entrenched habits in a single session.<br>
It didn't help that some groups espousing NLP are New Age groups who, by<br>
definition, will try anything once.<br>
<p>
Most serious of all, though, is the allegation that NLP is really<br>
another name for hypnosis, against which SDA's have been strictly warned<br>
by the Spirit of Prophecy.  Those already disposed to call the<br>
leadership of the church Laodicean (if not Babylonian) thus found a<br>
stick with which to beat the General Conference.<br>
<p>
NLP, however, has nothing to do with hypnosis or even hypnotherapy.<br>
Having worked for a time in the library of the American Association of<br>
Nurse Anesthetists I was able to read several books and journal articles<br>
on hypnotherapy, which bears no resemblance to NLP or to the stagecraft<br>
mumbo-jumbo that was called "hypnotism" back in the days of vaudeville.<br>
<p>
But back to NLP.  Of the 78 pages in the Lab I manual, only one covered<br>
NLP.  Some ministers, conscious of the ambiguous nature of the subject,<br>
simply removed the page in question.  LEAD, however, has recently<br>
sponsored NLP certification classes, and as you discovered, there are<br>
still Lab I manuals floating around.  All this has fed the rumor mill<br>
about pastors practicing hypnotism under the guise of NLP.  Even though<br>
no proof has even been offered that actual harm has been done by the use<br>
of NLP in a pastoral counseling session.  But since when have<br>
rumor-mongers relied on solid information?<br>
<p>
For more information on the controversy, see the following:<br>

June 1992, pp. 18-20.<br>

Dear SDAnetters:<br>
<p>
Do any of you know where I could get some info on the Shephard's Rod?  I <br>
think I remember reading a recent article in a SDA publication about the <br>
subject, but I'm not sure where.<br>
Any help (especially documented articles) would be greatly appreciated.<br>

I think we need to remember that the issue of News is not only a matter<br>
of principal.  It is a matter of cost to the organization giving access<br>
to news.  The question then also becomes:  should an SDA school be<br>
paying money in order to give students access to materials which are<br>
definitely against the principles of the institution?<br>
<p>
 From a stewardship standpoint, I do not believe that we should fund<br>
activities which go contrary to our principles.  If students wish to<br>
access the information, that is their choice, but let them do it<br>
at their own expense.<br>

Well, I know of one discussion - that's this quarters Sabbath School Lessons,<br>
which handles these issues.<br>
<p>
BTW. I feel that what Job book wants to tell us is that the evil is *not* from God<br>
God. I see evil something like a cancer that has hit this body that we call the world<br>
world. I do not usually blame the doctor for being sick, but we usually blame <br>
God for all evil in the world! The evil come into this world independent of God,<br>
and now we and He together fight (for our lives) to cure the cancer cells and melanomas <br>
melanomas. Eventually we will conquer the disease but not without a major <br>
operation1<br>

NLP: I think the church would find it quite helpful if the pastors<br>
used these ideas. Just one point: I myself is definitely a<br>
visual type in contrast to an audio type person, which means that <br>
I quite often fall asleep during sermons (btw I have heard most of them<br>
during my 35 years a church member ;-) ). I think I get about 5% of what<br>
people tell me but if they show me the thing in a graph I get<br>
- say 70% ! Why use 60 minutes to explain a thing when you can clarify<br>
the issue with a good picture in 15 minutes!<br>

Hi, this is my first post on SDAnet, although I have been reading for<br>
the past three or four weeks.  Let me introduce myself before entering<br>
into the main discussion.<br>
<p>
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Computer<br>
Science at Pacific Union College.  I began teaching here during winter<br>
quarter 1990.  My area of expertise is atomic physics.  I have taught<br>
physics and engineering courses, but so far I have not taught any<br>
CS courses.  I was raised Roman Catholic by my parents, but rejected<br>
RC teachings as a teenager.  I first became aware of the SDA church<br>
during the summer between college graduation and the beginning of<br>
graduate school, and was baptized two years later.  My wife is an RN<br>
at St. Helena Hospital and Health Center which is an SDA facility<br>
located four miles from the college.  We have a six-year-old son who<br>
attends kindergarten at PUC Elementary.<br>
<p>
And now to the issue at hand:<br>
<p>
Steve asked about archeological sites that have been identified as<br>
Sodom and Gomorrah.  I recently attended a weekend series or seminars<br>
by Ron Wyatt who claims to have discovered not only Sodom and Gomorrah<br>
but the other cities of the plain as well.  I purchased a copy of a<br>
video in which he documents his findings.  The most interesting<br>
evidence may be summarized as follows:<br>
<p>
  (1) The sites contain powdery sulfur balls imbedded in extensive<br>
      ashen structures.<br>
<p>
  (2) These structures are consistent with the ruins of cities,<br>
      whereas the rock formations in surrounding areas are not.<br>
<p>
  (3) The sites extend from Zoar (Bela) and Sodom located south<br>
      of the Dead Sea to  Gomorrah which is located below Masada<br>
      on the western shore of the Dead Sea to Admah and Zeboiim<br>
      which are located *north* of the Dead Sea, far from the<br>
      traditional sites.<br>
<p>
Anyone interested in obtaining the video may send me email and I will<br>
dig out the necessary information.  (I do not have it with me at work.)<br>
<p>
Some of you may be familiar with Ron Wyatt.  He has written a book<br>
entitled _Discovered:_Noah's_Ark_ in which he claims to have found<br>
not only Noah's ark, but also remains of chariots at the bottom of<br>
the Gulf of Aqaba (sp?), Mount Sinai, the mechanism for raising stones<br>
for the construction of pyramids, and most incredibly, the Ark of<br>
the Covenant!  Some of his claims are absolutely incredible, however,<br>
he is very convincing in person.  He is either telling the truth or<br>
he is the world's best liar.  On the other hand, some of his statements<br>
seem entirely reasonable, such as regarding the mechanism for building<br>
pyramids and his method of analyzing the site he claims to be the<br>
remains of Noah's ark.<br>
<p>
I will let you be the judge for yourself.<br>
<p>
<p>

At most universities in Australia undergraduates are denied access<br>
to any internet facilities, due mainly to alleged resource limitations.<br>
Postgraduates are supposed to be too busy to waste time on trivia, so<br>
in theory no Australian student would read any of those newsgroups<br>
anyway!<br>
<p>
I don't know much about usenet, so this idea may not be practical. But<br>
the best policy for any institution would seem to be to subscribe to<br>
what is needed and no more. The computing resources are not there to<br>
provide trivial reading material for staff and students, they are<br>
there to be used for specific purposes. This way if anyone does wish<br>
to read alt.satanism, alt.tasteless or whatever, they would need to<br>
put forward a worthwhile case for doing so. I don't see this is<br>
"censorship", just as a wise use of resources.<br>
<p>
What I do strongly object to is an institution covertly monitoring<br>
the behaviour of individuals. This is an invasion of privacy. In this<br>
day and age of information sharing and global data access, we need to<br>
be very careful to preserve what privacy we have left!<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
ps I sent a message the other day to st0o+SDA@andrew.cmu.edu...did<br>
this get through? Is that the address we're supposed to be using now?<br>

I'm at a secular university, we don't restrict access to the internet,<br>
but we do have strong policies on displaying pictures etc on students<br>
terminal screens. Naturally we are not always around to police such<br>
things. There is a strong emphasis here, that use of the computing<br>
facilities shouldn't be offensive to anyone, hence the restrictions.<br>
<p>
Not sure if this helps. We've found that less restrictions usually<br>
brings out the best in the students, of course there are always<br>
exceptions. I guess the logic is that if something is allowed, then it<br>
no longer has the added spice of being forbidden, therefore its not such<br>
a thrill to do it.<br>

Lola asked about Mark Martin and the tapes she had received.<br>
<p>
I remember Mark when he was at Pacific Union College in the late 70's. I had <br>
several classes with him. I believe, Lola, you were there at the time so you <br>
might look him up in an old "Funny Book."<br>
<p>
As I remember him he was very nice but totally consumed by 1888. At the time <br>
there were several who were deeply interested in 1888, but I think Mark had <br>
his own interpretation of what happened.<br>
<p>
As to how he got your address, there are many ways ministries get lists. Many <br>
purchase lists from other sources, in some cases Unions have sold their <br>
mailing lists although I don't know of any who do that any more. I know of at <br>
least one independent ministry who paid someone to steal a mailing list.<br>
<p>
Maybe this info is too old now but I don't always get to my Compuserve account<br>
on time these days.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I remember about a year ago hearing a very interesting lecture by Dr. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bill Shea that included information about several archeological sites on </i><br>
<i>&gt; the east side of the Dead Sea.  These cities appear at a suitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; archeological layer to have been destroyed by fire, and it is now thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; that they may be the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Does anyone know where print documentation may be had for this discovery.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would assume in the Biblical Archaeology Review, to which I have wanted</i><br>
<i>&gt; to subscribe for years but never found the subscription address.  Any </i><br>
<i>&gt; SDAnet members can help us out on this?</i><br>

In searching our CD-ROM of the Religion Index (American Theological<br>
Library Association), I find these two citations:<br>
<p>
Steinberg, David, and others, "On the New Site Identifications for Sodom<br>
and Gomorrah," _Biblical Archaeology Review_ v7 No 1, p. 18+,<br>
January-February 1981.<br>
<p>
Hattem, Willem C. van, "Once again: Sodom and Gomorrah," _The Biblical<br>
Archaeologist_ v44, p. 87-92, Spring 1981.  ABSTRACT:  The location of<br>
Sodom and Gomorrah has been an itneresting--and elusive--problem in<br>
historical research for a very long time.  Different interpretations of<br>
the biblical and archaeological evidence have produced various theories<br>
regarding the location of the famous cities.  More recent evidence,<br>
however, has challenged some of the old ideas and has produced new and<br>
enlightening information about the missing "Cities of the Plain."<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, this database is only updated once a year and we haven't<br>
yet received the 1992 index, so anything more recent than 1991 won't be<br>
covered.  The good news is that this index is one which we are in the<br>
advanced states of implementing on our online catalog.  It will soon be<br>
available on the campus network.  I am not sure when (or how) it will be<br>
made available off campus (depends on licensing agreements not ye<br>
signed).  We hope this will be something that we can share with other<br>
church entities (and individuals?).<br>
<p>
The address of the Biblical Arachaeology Review is (at least for<br>
subscriptions) PO Box 7026, Red Oak, IA  51591.  The number is 1-800-678-5555.  The subscription price is $24 (6/year).  If you need the editorial<br>
office (which is in Washington, DC), I can supply that.<br>
<p>
As usual, this information is easily available from almost any library<br>
(we do have directories of periodicals), including those who don't<br>
subsribe to a journal.  Articles are available through Interlibrary Loan<br>
(or let me know, and we can have our ILL office send them out).  This is<br>
a fairly routine type of reference question.  However, I don't mind<br>
being your online reference librarian!<br>

Just a few comments -- one of our church officials said that Adventist<br>
pastors were aware of some objectionable material in NLP.  One<br>
person here rewrote the program to remove this.  Even after this,<br>
some pastors were uncomfortable with it and more was removed.<br>
So it's not just the rumor mongers that were concerned.<br>
<p>
It didn't help that books like ``Frogs to Princes'' and<br>
``Trance-Formation'' were on the recommended reading list even<br>
for Lab I.  Also, I was told by a conference official that<br>
since Lab I  and II were used, LEAD consultants have gone into<br>
hypnotism and don't see anything wrong with it, so the churcch<br>
has stopped using their stuff.<br>
<p>
Any corrections to this info would be appreciated.  But I didn't<br>
get most of it from the independent ministries.<br>

Hello,<br>
<p>
[Healy, Tammy R writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; I am a student at WWC and I think that Internet shouldn't be policed.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; they start with alt.sex, will they later decide to ban alt.vampyres or</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.pagan, too.  I admit some of it is morally incorrect, but I figure</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're old enough now to make decisions on what we read.</i><br>
<p>
The fact that the service was decided on, provided and administered by the college<br>
administration for the benefit of the students suggests to me that they indeed have<br>
the right and the obligation to make sure that what is allowed through the net into<br>
the school should be filtered at their discretion.<br>
<p>
We are not talking about a service that is available to students via some off-campus<br>
network or bulletin board  where students can dial up with a modem and access all the<br>
garbage they want.  The difference here is that the choice is theirs and only theirs<br>
(the college has no part of that decision).  But in this case where the decision to<br>
allow Internet on campus and provide it for the students is made by the college,<br>
 then they (those that decided to allow it) are responsible for what comes through it<br>
to the students.<br>
<p>
I liked the example someone used of the campus bookstore...they don't provide<br>
Playboy, etc for the students because the store is run by the college.  Yes the<br>
magazine can be had from other local stores but the real issue is that something that<br>
is provided and sponsored by the college should uphold and conform to the morals that<br>
the college teaches.<br>

Sorry to bother you but did you get my last e-mail stating that you could send<br>
all of the past 2 months to me.  I haven't received anything from that <br>
time period.<br>
I was just wondering.<br>

By happenstance, shortly after I posted to the list about Sodom and<br>
Gomorrah, who should walk into the library but Bill Shea.  Of course I<br>
asked him for further guidance on archaeology of the area.  His<br>
information is as follows.  There has been a long series of<br>
archaeological expeditions to the southeast Dead Sea Region, beginning<br>
in the 1970s, and the latest season being 1990.  The principal<br>
archaeologists involved are Walater Rast and R. Thomas Schaub.  These<br>
expeditions have been reported in detail in a number of publications of<br>
the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR) [their bulletin and<br>
excavation reports) as well as in some of the more popular archaeology<br>
publications (e.g. Biblical Archaeology Review).  They have dug at<br>
various sites, most notably Bab Edh-Dhra, as well as more recently at<br>
Numeirah (1990).  It usually takes several years for scientific reports<br>
of such expeditions to appear.<br>
<p>
In searching our online catalog (telnet library.libr.andrews.edu; login<br>
library), I find 8 publications by Rast, 3 by Schaub and 2 that mention<br>
Bab Edh-Dhra.  In the _Religion Index_ CD-ROM, I find 1 reference to<br>
Numeirah, 28 to Bab Edh-Dhra, 36 to Rast, and I forgot to write down how<br>
many to Schaub.  If I weren't so busy doing such things as trying to get<br>
the _Religion Index_ loaded into our online catalog (not to mention<br>
recovering from the second disc crash of our DEC 5000 in 2 months!) I<br>
might spend more time figuring out how to forward these to you<br>
electronically.  But then, I don't really know how interested you are in<br>
reading technical archaeological publications anyway.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, I mentioned that the _Playboy_ rumor was long-standing<br>
because not only do I remember it from my college days, but it keeps<br>
cropping up here from time to time (as, indeed, it did on the list)!<br>

Whilst reading in Churchhill's History of the English Speaking People,<br>
Intro to Vol 1, he refers to the "Pelagian heresy" re free-will (no<br>
specifics).  From an ardent Protestant stand-point (vs his CofE (?)),<br>
I'm curious if maybe it wasn't so heretical after all.<br>
<p>
Can someone outline for a simple plough-boy (to borrow Wycliffe (?))<br>
what this was about?  Thx.<br>

<i>&gt; I think we need to remember that the issue of News is not only a matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; of principal.  It is a matter of cost to the organization giving access</i><br>
<i>&gt; to news.  The question then also becomes:  should an SDA school be</i><br>
<i>&gt; paying money in order to give students access to materials which are</i><br>
<i>&gt; definitely against the principles of the institution?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From a stewardship standpoint, I do not believe that we should fund</i><br>
<i>&gt; activities which go contrary to our principles.  If students wish to</i><br>
<i>&gt; access the information, that is their choice, but let them do it</i><br>
<i>&gt; at their own expense.</i><br>
<p>
Now this brings up something that students at CUC are a little sensitive about.<br>
 It is tuition money that pays for the school.  So the students should have<br>
some say in how the money is spent.  I don't think it is valid to argue this on<br>
the basis of money since the students actually pay for the connection anyway.<br>
<p>
Short story:  When I first started working here the Internet connection was<br>
being paid for by selling junk food to the adult evening students.  We made<br>
just enough to pay for the connection.  Since we move to the science building<br>
the school has been paying for the connection.<br>

As one who plays theologian on the net, I understand the term _Midrash_<br>
to be a Hebrew term which refers to reinterpreting inspired writings in <br>
light of new realities.  One example in the Bible of such would be <br>
1st Chronicles, where the case is made that the covenant was really <br>
with David and not so much with Abraham.  Most of the gory details of David's<br>
career are absent in 1 Chronicles as compared to II Samuel.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that the last 15 years or so have seen a lot of Midrash<br>
within the Seventh-day Adventist Church  (much before that I was too young<br>
to observe much).  A recent article referred to the young people currently <br>
growing up within our church as the "Jesus generation," pointing out<br>
correctly that the current crop of teens is experiencing much less<br>
legalism<br>
than ever before, and that the emphasis on salvation by faith within the<br>
church has never been higher.<br>
<p>
To a certain extent, the church is still reacting to the emphasis on<br>
salvation by faith that really started getting shouted loudly in the<br>
1970's.<br>
The various groups in whatever debate all in their own way have to address<br>
the question:  "Given that some of the elements of the SDA culture are not <br>
absolutely essential for salvation, should we still cling to them?"<br>
<p>
Desmond Ford and his crowd answered that question firmly "no."  Many of <br>
the books written since then have been trying to explain why the answer is <br>
"yes."  In a broad sense I am thinking of the work of George Knight, <br>
Martin Weber, and others here.  I think this work is valuable and would like<br>
to join it (if SDAnet hasn't ruined my writing style for life !:)  perhaps<br>
I am doomed to forever write in sound bites).<br>
<p>
In the process of Midrash we can discover new and better motivations to <br>
do the right things we have always done.  And hopefully we can move more <br>
members from motivations of fear to motivations of love.<br>
<p>

Religio-moral issues aside, there are concerns about the appropriateness of<br>
providing access to materials of an, um, disquieting nature.<br>
<p>
There is a legal concept called "common carrier."  This is how the telephone<br>
company can't be held liable for damages if someone plots a criminal act<br>
against you over the 'phone.  Or commits one, using a modem, or whatever.<br>
<p>
This principle rests on the idea that the telephone company disclaims any<br>
control over the content of the information and will simply move signals from<br>
one point to another for anyone who will pay the bills.<br>
<p>
This principle has *NOT* yet been generally extended to computer data<br>
networks.  And, if any controls or selection processes are in place, it<br>
becomes even more difficult to claim common carrier protection.  People have<br>
been arrested and thrown into jail because someome uploaded child pornography<br>
to their bulletin boards.  Literally.<br>
<p>
A topic of some concern to for-profit, moral-judgement-free network providers<br>
now is the move to put K-12 schools on the internet.  Will the network<br>
providers be held liable for legally obscene materials that these high school<br>
and grade school students access?  Legally, there is no clear answer at all.<br>
<p>
I don't intend this note as support for an incredibly fascist Internet policy.<br>
Far from it.  Rather, it's a call for an up-front understanding and concensus<br>
of acceptable use of the shared resource that WWC is putting into place.<br>
Prurient material is but one area of concern.  Others include pirated software<br>
packages, huge sound files, use of college computers as launching points for<br>
remote system attacks, poorly-designed, high-volume network generating<br>
applications of many sorts, electronic mail harassment of all sorts, and the<br>
list goes on.  And on.  And on.<br>
<p>
In short, don't address the problem from a "what will we prohibit"<br>
perspective, but from the viewpoint of "what are we using this for."  Don't<br>
put the fascist technical controls into place, but try to develop<br>
self-disclipling based on well-established principles.  Remeber: it's always<br>
better to solve the human problems in a humane way than to try to solve the<br>
human problems technically.  (If you want more support for that last<br>
statement, let me know....)<br>

Dear SDAnetters:<br>
I have mixed feelings about announcing that the text of David Koresh's<br>
radio address back in March is available via anonymous ftp.  But, I think<br>
there may be some who have an interest in reading and studying the<br>
erroneous teachings that led over 70 men, women, and children to a fiery<br>
death at Ranch Apocalypse.   This is especially intriguing to us in view<br>
of the fact that the majority of those who perished in the flames had at<br>
one time been members in good standing of the SDA church.  What happened<br>
to them?  What did the Davidians offer that we didn't? Could their<br>
departure from our church have been avoided by more love and support from<br>
our members?  Do we just write them off as "weak members" who were led<br>
astray, or did Christ say we are to protect the weak members?  These are<br>
very interesting questions....<br>
<p>
To obtain the rather lengthy text of Koresh's speech, ftp to 130.43.3.3<br>
and go to the following directory: /Library/Religion/Fringe .  The name of<br>
the file is "koresh.txt" and it's in regular ASCII.<br>
<p>
I'd be interested to hear any feedback from the net on the questions I've<br>
raised above and/or on the text of Koresh's speech.<br>

Steven,<br>
Is there any way you can add the following to my previous message about<br>
Koresh:<br>
<p>
If anyone doesn't have ftp capabilities or would prefer to have me e-mail<br>
them the Koresh text, I will do it -- just let me know by private e-mail.<br>

Regarding tution's paying for the school. . .<br>
<p>
First, I doubt seriously that tution pays the full costs of running<br>
CUC.  Are there no church subsidies for capital or operating?  Are there<br>
no donors who gave largely because of the priciples CUC espoused?  Are<br>
there no endowments?  Thus, folks besides the tution-paying students<br>
may have interests in the institution.  If money is the determinent,<br>
then the question of the multimillion dollar donor from a week or 10<br>
days ago should be reviewed.<br>
<p>
Secondly,  if one elects to join an organization knowing its standards,<br>
e.g., a private club, then one presumably has agreed to abide by the<br>
institution's [club's] rules and adhere to its principles.  Surely,<br>
one can work from the inside to change the standards, but merely<br>
saying, "I pay my dues [tuition]" isn't persuasive that the institution<br>
should change its rules.  Indeed, one of the constant tensions in<br>
private education is the tension between money and the right to set the<br>
standards.  <br>
<p>
A few years ago, we at the law school gave back a $2,000,000 gift<br>
because the donor felt that the gift had implied terms that were<br>
not in harmony with its express terms, and that although we were in<br>
harmony with the documents executed with the acceptance of the<br>
gift, we were not in harmony with the implied terms that the donor<br>
felt all understood [we didn't "hear" what he/they thought was said].<br>
We were recognizing the donor's right to spend money in harmony with<br>
his desires, and our right to abide by the principles of academic<br>
freedom.  If students want to have access to materials the college<br>
finds out of harmony with its principles/standards, then the student<br>
may 1)spend her/his tuition dollars elsewhere; 2)get the information<br>
through other means at her/his expense, or 3)try to change the rules/<br>
standards of the institution through internal processes.<br>
<p>
--Jerry<br>
USC Law Center<br>
<p>
P.S. Was it Groucho Marx who said, "I don't want to belong to any club<br>
that would have me as a member"?  Standrads for membership often result<br>
in scarcity which creates its own market.<br>

First off, the news about the young people's BASIS, and predominate focus of<br>
faith is extremely good news!  We should rejoice.  I'd agree with Tang.<br>
More and more young people in the church view the law of God (in context of<br>
the principles which make His character and kingdom) as complimentary to<br>
their belief in salvation by grace through faith.  You see the fruit of <br>
it in their<br>
speaking out *against* inconsistencies and non-Christ-like ways perpetrated in<br>
the name of "morality", religion and tradition many times rooted deeply <br>
in "church<br>
culture".  Not unlike what Christ did while on earth.<br>

One question which remains in my mind is: What are the real, practical<br>
implications of the nature of sin/nature of Christ debate? There must be <br>
some quite substantial ones, otherwise there would be no motivation for <br>
this debate.<br>
<p>
I think I understand the motivation for one side. Let me summarize:<br>
Sinful acts do not need to be a part of the life of a Christian. In fact<br>
they _should_ not be. Christ has demonstrated for us how to live in an<br>
evil world without participating in its corruption. He is now willing and<br>
able to work in us against evil, as well as forgiving us for our sinful<br>
past. We are Christ's witnesses both to our fellow humans and to the<br>
entire universe. As such, it is our responsibility to accept what Christ<br>
offers us, make the decision to break the shackles of evil, and progress<br>
towards a victorious Christian life.<br>
<p>
This makes sense to me. With or without the concept of original sin I<br>
can agree with that. (I suppose I have phrased it such a way that I<br>
can!)<br>
<p>
What I would like to know is, why do the others find it important to<br>
make statements like this one from Noe:<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
The more clearly we define our terms, the more room for agreement I find<br>
in your positions, especially with regard to the sanctified life.  The<br>
statement you've quoted several times, where EGW says that if we say we<br>
cannot keep the law perfectly we are accusing God of being unjust, is very<br>
good.  What it means is that we ***can*** keep God's law perfectly by<br>
accepting the perfect righteousness of Christ.  Christ kept the law<br>
perfectly and his perfection is credited to our account.  We can add<br>
nothing to the transaction.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
What drives this debate? A skeptic would say that a statement such as the<br>
above only serves to absolve the Christian from the responsibility to<br>
avoid evil in the here and now. That a continued emphasis on this aspect<br>
of the gospel is made because the Christian does not really wish to live<br>
as a disciple of Christ should.<br>
<p>
I am sure this is not the real reason for this emphasis. Could Noe, or<br>
anyone else who represents this side of the issue, provide a couple<br>
of paragraphs explaining why you feel it is important to provide this<br>
emphasis? And also what implications you see this having for the <br>
Christian?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Tony<br>

Yes, I see your point, but I do believe that parents and students pay good<br>
tuition money for the privalege of attending a Christian institution that<br>
teaches and upholds the SDA doctrines, beliefs, and ethics.  If you didn't value<br>
that, why would you then pay such high prices to attend.  Therefore, the school<br>
is under obligation and charter to fulfill this role for those willing to pay<br>
for it.  Then why should they compromise or be expected to change their role for<br>
the sake of providing access to a service that communicates information that is<br>
contrary to these beliefs?  This is not an issue of _what_ on Usenet is good or<br>
bad but an issue of whether the college has the right to filter or not.  I<br>
believe they are, as expressed in hard earned dollars paid to the college that<br>
are "voting" that they want the college to uphold standards and to provide a<br>
quality and consistent Christian education.<br>

Well, mention Des Ford and you _knew_ you would hear from me, didn't<br>
you?  Culturally, Des Ford is more of an Adventist than I am!  He<br>
repudiated a couple of doctrinal positions that he considered non-<br>
salvific issues, but he is still a big upholder of the general culture<br>
and lifestyle of adventism.  I may be telling you something that you<br>
already know, Steve, but your post sounded as though you were throwing<br>
Ford in with the liverated lifestyle crowd, and he definitely is a<br>
conservative in that area.  (<br>
(That was supposed to be "liberated" two lines up there!)<br>

Hello people,<br>
	does anyone know anything about a guy called John Ellis or something<br>
like that, who has been advertising in some newspapers, including the one at<br>
Waco, and putting in a long article with strange claims in it? Apparently he<br>
claims to be the pastor of a 1 member SDA church, and calls the branch<br>
Davidians the "matyrs of the Mount Carmel SDA church" and claims that there<br>
are 10 million SDAs in the world, of which 3 million are not under the GC,<br>
and seem to form some sort of stricter sect of SDAs (they are all<br>
vegetarians, presumably of the vegan type, and the men wear suspenders<br>
instead of belts and the ladies long flowing skirts, don't own TVs etc) and<br>
then goes on to make other strange claims, even quoting E G White in the<br>
process. He end with a call to action against the rich merchants or<br>
something like that, which sounds like communist ideology.<br>
	Anyway, if non-SDAs read this guy's ads, they might think his views<br>
are representative of our, and that would be a misrepresentation indeed.<br>

Steve, I didn't see my message of earlier today, so please replace with<br>
this one if still on time.<br>
<p>
Dennis has regained consciousness, and is writing notes.  They won't<br>
take him off the ventilator until tomorrow morning (standard procedure).<br>
<p>
Thanks for all your prayers.  He should be home in 10 days.<br>

<i>&gt; As one who plays theologian on the net, I understand the term _Midrash_</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be a Hebrew term which refers to reinterpreting inspired writings in </i><br>
<i>&gt; light of new realities.... </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that the last 15 years or so have seen a lot of Midrash</i><br>
<i>&gt; within the Seventh-day Adventist Church  (much before that I was too young</i><br>
<i>&gt; to observe much).... </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the process of Midrash we can discover new and better motivations to </i><br>
<i>&gt; do the right things we have always done.  And hopefully we can move more </i><br>
<i>&gt; members from motivations of fear to motivations of love.</i><br>
<p>
Steve:<br>
<p>
In a sense, Midrash is reinterpretation of sacred texts.  But it is a<br>
limited sense.  My working definition of the term comes from the essay<br>
"Midrash" by Barry W. Holtz, which appears in Holtz (ed.)<br>
_Back To The Sources: Reading The Classic Jewish Texts_ (New York:<br>
Summit, 1984, ch. 3):<br>
<p>
"[W]e can see the central issue behind the emergence of Midrash as the<br>
need to deal with the presence of cultural or religious tension or<br>
discontinuity.  Where there are questions that demand answers, and where<br>
there are new cultural and intellectual pressures that must be<br>
addressed, Midrash comes into play...<br>
   The Bible is loath to tell us the motivations, feelings, or thoughts<br>
of characters.  Rarely giving us descriptive details either of people<br>
or places, it is composed in a stark, uncompromising style.<br>
   Hence in the laconic style of the Bible, we find one significant cause<br>
for the necessity of Midrash.  Midrash comes to fill in the gaps, to<br>
tell us the details that the Bible teasingly leaves out: what did Isaac<br>
think as his father took him to be sacrificed?  The Bible doesn't tell<br>
us, but Midrash fills it in...Why did Cain kill Abel?  Once again the<br>
Bible is silent, but Midrash is filled with explanation.  How tall was<br>
Adam as he walked in the Garden?  Look to the midrashic material, not to<br>
the Bible, for such details.  The human mind desires answers,<br>
motivations, explanations.  Where the Bible is mysterious and silent,<br>
Midrash comes to unravel the mystery." (pp. 179-180).<br>
<p>
This definition has the interesting side-effect of classifying Spirit of<br>
Prophecy writings as being midrashic.  By the same token, Lois<br>
Erickson's biblical novels (e.g., _Leah_) might also be considered to be<br>
in the tradition of Midrash.<br>
<p>
I hadn't intended to solve anything with this reply; just to throw<br>
something into the stew pot.<br>

Hello fellow netters,<br>
<p>
I posted a message about a week ago about a John Gunter (an evangelical from an<br>
Assemblies of God church) predicting the end of Portland, Oregon due to an<br>
earthquake as part of God's judgement over the evil and satanic activity going<br>
on.  He got quite abit of media coverage on TV and radio with his street<br>
preaching techniques and caused quite a bussle of activity in the area.<br>
<p>
Well, as a follow-up, I guess you can see there are no news reports of such an<br>
event.  But I wanted to tell you that last night on our local (Portland) news,<br>
John (who had gone to Montana to ride out the destruction) publically admitted<br>
that his message was NOT from God and that this in no way negates the fact that<br>
a God in heaven does indeed exist.  He apologized to all for the inconvenience<br>
and hassle he caused people.  He is back to work here in the Portland area.<br>
<p>
So much for false impressions.<br>
<p>

Bruce, <br>
I see a small whole in your analogy.  The students of WWC are paying for <br>
this thruogh thei tuition.  If WWC wants to ban alt.sex or any other <br>
morally questionable newsgroups, then they should allow the STUDENTS to <br>
vote on it and make an informed decision.  If the majoroity of WWC felt <br>
that the morally questionable newsgroups shouldn't be on the WWC <br>
internet, then, it's our decision, not jsut a decisions dictated by the <br>
high and mighties in the AD buliding.<br>

I think that the church is partly responsible for some of its<br>
serious members being drawn off into Waco type things.  People<br>
are hungry for some serious prophetic exposition which isn't<br>
found in the church today as much as it used to be.  They are<br>
also sensitive to our failures to live up to the light we have<br>
been given.  So it's easy for someone else to claim he has the<br>
true church which is more faithful than we are.<br>

Steve,<br>
    I thought you might like this for the SDA net.<br>
<p>
*********************************************************<br>
<p>
On the front page of the 5-03-93 edition of the Wall Street Journal,<br>
there is an article (in the column known as the A column) titled "Can<br>
Texaco Win A Battle if the Lord Is on the Other Side? -- Gas Station<br>
Owner Says God Calls for Sabbath Closing, Despite Company's Rules."<br>
<p>
In Salem Oregon, there is a Christian fundamentalist (he puts the fun in<br>
fun-damentalist) named Barry Davis who refuses to operate his gas<br>
station from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown.  The article says that<br>
he isn't SDA but the SDA church is legally defending him saying that he<br>
shouldn't be forced to operate against his religious beliefs.<br>
<p>
There's lots of interesting stuff here.  Apparantly Mr. Davis operates<br>
some of the most successful gas stations in the country.  His take home<br>
pay last year was almost $470,000.  Texaco has given him commendations<br>
and other awards asking him about what made him so successful.  In<br>
January he started to close on Saturdays (fri. sundown to sat. sundown)<br>
putting out a sign "Closed for Sabbath."  Texaco estimates that they<br>
lost 26% percent of sales due to this action by Mr. Davis.  Davis,<br>
claims that he can more than make up for the closing during the week. <br>
The ACLU says that Davis doesn't have a legal leg to stand on because it<br>
isn't an employer employee relationship, but a contract.  "In the eyes<br>
of the law he might as well be general Motors" says Lewis Maltby legal<br>
director of the ACLU.<br>
<p>
It gets better.  Davis claims to have direct communication with God.<br>
When Texaco suggested that his profits from Saturday's operations be<br>
donated to his favorite religious cause, Davis responed by saying that<br>
he asked God and God found it unacceptable.  <br>
<p>
At a lunch with Texaco officials last year he "revealed" his secret for<br>
success.  "I told them God takes care of me and mine.  Everything I've<br>
asked for I've gotten."  In an earlier discussion with Texaco officials<br>
he told them that "God once appeared in a green cloud, along with<br>
thunder and lightning."  <br>
<p>
The article ends with a quote from Davis: "For years I was a hero, now<br>
suddenly they're treating me like the wacko from Waco."<br>

<p>
A strong undercurrent that I am seeing, especially in confrontations<br>
with "independent ministries" is conference officers insisting on<br>
submission to their authority while insisting that their confrontation<br>
has nothing to do with theology.  So, members get disfellowshiped<br>
and churches disbanded over the issue of authority while carefully<br>
setting asside theology.  And so I find more and more SDA members<br>
who want to align themselves with the church who more and more<br>
insist on a sort of blind obedience to their pastor and to church<br>
officers.  And so the stage is set.  Let some of these folks who<br>
are blindly obedient to church officers "have their eyes opened"<br>
such that their "blind obedience" evaporates.  But their mind set<br>
is that of blind obedience.  And so they align themselves with the<br>
leadership of those who "opened" their eyes.  And so I think that<br>
conference pressure for membership obedience is lending itself to<br>
more Wacos rather than solving the problem.<br>
<p>
The apostle Paul writes about how glad he is that he had not<br>
baptised very many people because some of the other evangelists<br>
were developing quite a following -- some saying I am a follower<br>
of Apolos and others saying I am a disciple of . . . .  Paul's<br>
point being that we should rather be disciples of Jesus and not<br>
of Paul or of Apolos.  And so, if a conference pastor comes<br>
preaching the truth, as confirmed as the Bereans would, then I'm<br>
eager to go listen to that preacher.  And if an indepent ministry<br>
preacher has truth to preach then I'm going to listen to his<br>
sermons as well.  If I find a preacher is out of touch with the<br>
Bible, then I don't care if that preacher is of the conference or<br>
an indepent, I frankly don't care to continue to listen to him/her.<br>
Also, I don't pledge my alegiance to any particular ministry or<br>
conference.  I am not a disciple of . . . . . or of . . . . .<br>
I am a disciple of Jesus.<br>

Haven't you ever wondered what it would be like if the SDA church had its<br>
own court system to settle disbutes?  I keep thinking of Paul talking<br>
about Corenth when he said, "Is there not one of you wise enough...."  to<br>
judege your own people?  In stead they where making fools of themselves<br>
before the public councels.  Do we not do the same now???<br>

There are those wise enough.  Or at least there are quite a few<br>
SDA judges. <br>
I am of the opion that Christians should not submit their disputes to<br>
non-Christian judges.  There is a legal setting for binding arbitration,<br>
where all civil disputes can be settled.<br>
What do the people think?<br>

E-mail me for more details.  This promises to be really good.  If you <br>
are out of town accomodations can be arranged with local group members.<br>
(This means you, all the folks at Urbana-Champaign, Purdue, IU, etc.)<br>
<p>
I was totally awestruck to see the large list of names on the mailing <br>
list of people I know from college who I did not know were even in the area.<br>
We have some work to do hereabouts.<br>

The possibility is strong that new software will soon be acquired to <br>
manage SDAnet.  We have been using it for communications among our board<br>
members, with mostly good results.  If we make the move, it will be sometime<br>
in June.  It will be possible for us to have a wide variety of services <br>
that are now impossible.  I would like your opinions about which of these<br>
might be useful to you:<br>
<p>
1)  Daily digest:  SDAnet traffic arrives as one message per day.<br>
    Disadvantage:  harder to reply to each individual message<br>
    Advantage:  Less clutter in mailbox<br>
<p>
2)  Elm rules:   (I know, I have promised these for a month.  They're<br>
coming.)  These can show you how to split SDAnet mail into a sub-mailbox.<br>
<p>
3)  On-line ftp'able archive<br>
<p>
4)  Software understands LISTSERV commands for subscribe, unsubscribe<br>
    and nomail (but there will still be a human who understands English<br>
    as well).<br>
<p>
5)  Shorter headers<br>
<p>
6)  an SDAnet information center on Gopher/WWW<br>
<p>
What I would like to have but which would take some real work and will <br>
not be accomplished by just a software change is a digest that really <br>
is a digest in which discussion topics are grouped together and some<br>
extraneous posts and headers and included text are edited out.<br>

For the last two years, every message produced by SDA-L (all 50 of them<br>
or so) has been echoed to the readership of SDAnet.  SDAnet is currently<br>
exploring a LISTSERV-like software (which if successful, could also<br>
be used to move SDA-L to lasierra.edu).  It would be convenient<br>
to break the SDA-L link at this time, although not absolutely necessary.<br>
<p>
SDAnet readers would notice almost no effect from this.  But such an<br>
action could serve to revitalize SDA-L.  The core of subscribers which<br>
remain subscribed to SDA-L but not SDAnet shows that there is a market<br>
for a lower-traffic unmoderated list.  Many who can't take the high<br>
volume of SDAnet messages could stand to subcribe to a list with 20-30<br>
messages a month.  Also it would mean that anyone who wanted to read this<br>
traffic would have to go out and subscribe for him/herself.<br>
<p>
The reason why I have insisted on maintaining the link up until now<br>
is to have some guard against cross-posting.  If there were two totally<br>
independent nets and the same article were posted to both, then people<br>
who subscribe to both would get double copies.  Currently we assure that<br>
all SDAnet members are also SDA-L members so that cannot happen.<br>
Some guard against cross-posts would have to be maintained if this action<br>
were to happen.<br>
<p>
Before such a step is undertaken, SDA-L would need to find a slightly<br>
larger niche.  Ideally there should be some topics that are meant for<br>
SDA-L and not for SDAnet.  This can be done by picking from the many<br>
areas and types of traffic that SDAnet never covers.  If you see a topic<br>
that's mentioned only rarely on SDAnet, post to SDA-L and try it out.<br>
<p>
(SDAnet members, remember I will forward your post to SDA-L if it<br>
has SDA-L in the subject line.)<br>
<p>
I would appreciate any comments on this issue<br>

Hello friends,<br>
	The following are some of the poems written by Ee Teck Ee, which i<br>
have collected from the back of church bulletins and the like. Just thought<br>
you might like to have a look through them.<br>
<p>
-beng<br>
<p>
<p>
    YOUR HANDS<br>
<p>
It was not always through green pastures<br>
That you made me lie,<br>
Nor always was i able to rest<br>
With still waters beside,<br>
Often with fear and copious tears<br>
I walked through fire,<br>
Then,<br>
With drooping head and misty eyes<br>
I cried, "O God, why?"<br>
Heaven was silent.<br>
The mystery deepened<br>
There was no reply<br>
But i felt a tightening grip:<br>
It was your hands on mine.<br>
The hands which were once pierced with nails<br>
And they pulled mine<br>
To touch your wounded side,<br>
Thus,<br>
Assured of your love<br>
I gained courage to journey on.<br>
I shall speak of your love far and wide<br>
And so hasten the day<br>
When in Heaven with you, all of us shall abide<br>
And when with the same hands<br>
You shall wipe all tears dry.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
    MY MOTHER (from a child)<br>
<p>
Nobody is dearer than my mother<br>
Who always listens to what I say.<br>
No matter how busy i keep her<br>
She still cares for me in every way.<br>
<p>
Everyone wants me to be quiet.<br>
Everyone asks, "Where can peace be found?"<br>
But my mother never seems to mind at all.<br>
She is happy just to have me around.<br>
<p>
I remember the days when i was sick.<br>
I learned then even an angel can be tired.<br>
But she still appeared whenever i called her<br>
And her hands wiped my tears whenever i cried.<br>
<p>
"What is it like if there is no mother?"<br>
This is a most frightening thought!<br>
Just let me ask you one question in reply:<br>
"What is it like if there is no God?"<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
   MY PRAYER<br>
<p>
I do not pray that my days ahead,<br>
Be peaceful and free from burden;<br>
I only pray that Your will be done,<br>
In my life as it is in heaven.<br>
<p>
I do not pray that i will become,<br>
A depository of Your grace from above;<br>
I'd rather that You will make me<br>
A channel for Your matchless love.<br>
<p>
Oh God, open my ears and my eyes,<br>
To hear Your voice and to see Your face;<br>
Oh God, open my heart and my hands<br>
That i may the needy embrace.<br>
<p>
You have been my Creator and Saviour,<br>
And my guide since my birth;<br>
I pray that throughout eternity<br>
I will walk with you as i do on earth.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
 		    HIS HANDS<br>
<p>
       They Sprinkled stars on the Milky Way.<br>
      They poured water into the restless seas.<br>
    They looked so tiny when in the manger He lay.<br>
   They planed and chiselled for a carpenter was He.<br>
They broke the loaves and fishes and thousands were fed.<br>
 They streatched out and touched the man with leprosy.<br>
     Then one day on a wooden cross they were laid;<br>
       There they were nailed for you and for me.<br>

I once had a pastor here in Austin, who shall remain nameless, but was a<br>
prime example.  The current conference leadership was up for nomination.  There<br>
was a STRONG undercurrent of discontent with the confrenece president, and I<br>
was a delegate to the constituency meeting.  In the church board meeting just<br>
before the constituency meeting, he looked at me, and said something to the<br>
effect of "you do your job so I can do mine"  When I questioned him as to what<br>
he ment he plainly told me straight out that I was to vote FOR the confrence<br>
president.  I needless to say was appalled.  I voted the way I was going to<br>
(against ).  I was told later that he was furious at me, and publicly stated<br>
that as long as he was pastor here, I would never hold a board position agian<br>
<p>
after he left a couple of years later.  A year after that, I had my old<br>
board position back.  <br>
<p>
I find it hard to believe.  The pastor before that, was a businessman type<br>
and considered members in terms of dollars and cents.  I literaly overheard<br>
him in a board meeting, make the statement that it wasn't cost effective to<br>
have an evangilistic effort, as the it cost to much per person in relation to<br>
what they would be worth in dollars to the church.  Just blew me away.<br>
Cheers<br>

This is a response to Tammy's post about students paying for internet.<br>
<p>
Two points. First, students pay a significant, but not by any means the <br>
whole of the cost of the services provided by the college. Part of the cost <br>
is also paid by the church members through the Union Conference, part by <br>
various private donors, part by various agency grants. In the case of <br>
internet, it was my understanding that it  is partly funded by an NSF <br>
grant.  So  while the views of students clearly must be considered, the <br>
administration has to make a judgement that goes beyond the students' views <br>
only, and surely must consider whether what it supports or makes available <br>
to students corresponds with the mission of the college.<br>
<p>
Second, even if the students were paying it all, that translates to parents <br>
as well.  The fact is, although the students are no longer (in most cases) <br>
minors, the money they pay is often not theirs but their parents' and was <br>
paid based on their parents' judgement about what they are exposed to at <br>
college. It would seem that by that argument, the parents also deserve a <br>
vote. Further, even if it were students' funds (minus parents), these are <br>
often government guaranteed loans, and the government clearly reserves <br>
certain rights when it guarantees money.  Of course, the government does <br>
not concern itself with the issue at hand, but it does have a say in <br>
various aspects of school policy so long as the college receives funds that <br>
it guarantees.<br>
<p>
The point I am making is that although the voice of the student must be <br>
heard in matters which affect them, that voice is only one of many <br>
competing interests and is not by any means determinative.<br>

Just how common is this authoritarian, "do what we say", church leadership<br>
which is referred to from time to time on the net? I myself have rarely<br>
encountered it from the institution as such. Certainly individuals within<br>
the institution can be authoritarian - but they would be like that regardless<br>
of who they work for.<br>
<p>
One instance which does come to mind is a recent conference session, where the<br>
delegates from my church were reprimanded for discussing their views amongst<br>
themselves prior to the nominating committee meeting. This, apparently,<br>
constituted "lobbying" and was deemed to be prohibited. I found this incident<br>
quite incredible, but the fact was that the reprimand came from a very<br>
authoritarian individual whose conference employment was "on the line" at that<br>
particular meeting.<br>
<p>
My point is that I don't think church leadership as a whole expects "blind<br>
obedience". From my experience, there are many church members who wish that<br>
they could blindly follow, but the leadership will not oblige them!<br>

I enjoyed reading Tony's post.  To be honest, I agree with him in general,<br>
the SDA church does have a leadership which tries with varying degrees of<br>
success to listen to members concerns as long as the challenge does not come<br>
into certain "erroneous zones".<br>
<p>
What I have observed is not that the majority of SDA leaders are<br>
authoritarian instead of consensus builders, but rather the system has no<br>
checks or balances requiring consensus building by leadership.  It is<br>
possible for leaders to excercise almost absolute power toward their<br>
subordinates as long as they have the patronage of their superiors.  This<br>
system works as well as it does because most members of the system truly do<br>
have the good of the organization and the spread of God's word as their goal.<br>
 This allows persons who feel aggrieved to allow God to work in the system<br>
rather than pursue a more political resolution of grievances and it also<br>
keeps Godly leaders from excercising arbitrary power.  Unfortunately however,<br>
from my perspective, the system is not set up to require consensus building. <br>
This leaves leaders open to the corrupting effects of power.  Remember the<br>
adage: "Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely!"<br>
<p>
My opinions are based upon observations of several battles within the church,<br>
most of them involving the church's medical care institutions, both here and<br>
in the mission field.  <br>
<p>
I would be interested in hearing your opinions on how the church should<br>
organize its corporate structure to require consensus building in<br>
organizational decisions.<br>

One idea which I have had about a separate "niche" for SDA-L would be<br>
more of a news bulletin board than discussion items.  For example, if<br>
there were some piece of latebreaking news on this campus, someone can<br>
run to the computer rather than to the telephone to call Silver Spring<br>
and Loma Linda!  In many ways, being unmoderated would be an<br>
advantage--not to spread false information but so that it is clear that<br>
the writer is responsible for its accuracy.<br>
<p>
Another possibility, would be to have SDA-L concentrate on topics of<br>
specific interest to SDA higher education.  As more and more campuses<br>
get on the internet, this might be of importance to faculty and<br>
students.  It used to be that SDA faculty at these institutions met<br>
every 4 to 5 years to discuss common problems.  Because of financial<br>
retraints, these meetings no longer occur.  Perhaps we can continue them<br>
in an electronic forum.<br>
<p>
Just some ideas to think about.<br>

Recent posts, I think the long missive of Mervyn Maxwell that was posted<br>
to the net, made mention of something called the "Conciliation Process".<br>
So perhaps such a system already exists within the church.  If it does, <br>
then there are several cases where it ought to have been used but wasn't.<br>
Does anyone have any more information on what this may be?<br>

This is a collection of quotes from Bible Dictionaries, Encyclopedias,<br>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
                   Plato and the Immortality of the Soul<br>
<p>
Plato in The "Phaedo"<br>
<p>
     "The soul whose inseparable attribute  is  life  will  never  admit  of<br>
     life's  opposite,  death.   Thus  the soul is shown to be immortal, and<br>
     since immortal, indestructible [...] Do we  believe  there  is  such  a<br>
     thing as death? To be sure.  And is this anything but the separation of<br>
     the soul and body? And being dead is the attainment of this separation,<br>
     when  the  soul  exists  in herself and separate from the body, and the<br>
     body is parted from the soul. That is death [...] Death is  merely  the<br>
     separation of soul and body."<br>
<p>
Origen, an early architect of purgatory, openly confessed himself  to  be  a<br>
true  "Platonist, who believed in the immortality of the soul.", Ante-Nicene<br>
Fathers, vol IV, pp. 314, 402<br>
<p>
     "Souls are immortal, as God Himself is eternal and immortal."<br>
<p>
Tertullian, "Ante-Nicene Fathers", vol III, p.547<br>
<p>
     "For some things are known, even by  nature:  the  immortality  of  the<br>
     soul,  for  instance, is held by many.  [...] I may use, therefore, the<br>
     opinion of Plato, when he declares: 'Every soul is immortal'"<br>
<p>
Many scholars readily admit that Augustine  was  highly  influenced  by  the<br>
writings  of Plato. -- Augustine, "The Fathers of the Church: A New Transla-<br>
tion", translated by Gerald G. Walsh and Daniel J. Honan (New York: 1955)<br>
<p>
     "It is not easy to find a proof that will convince unbelievers  of  the<br>
     possibility  of  human  bodies  remaining not merely active, alive, and<br>
     uncorrupted after death, but also of continuing forever in the torments<br>
     of fire."  p. 340<br>
<p>
     "The reason why a soul succumbs to pain and leaves the body is that, in<br>
     this  life,  the  link  between our bodily members and the principle of<br>
     their life is so weak that this link cannot stand  the  strain  of  any<br>
     force that brings about very great or excessive pain.  But in the world<br>
     to come, the soul and body will be so united that a bond  between  them<br>
     can  be broken neither by the power of pain nor by the passing of time"<br>
     p. 342<br>
<p>
     ". . . . that reality is the soul, without whose presence  there  would<br>
     be  neither life nor movement in the body.  What is more, it is a real-<br>
     ity that is susceptible of pain and not susceptible of death.  Here, in<br>
     fact , we have the reality which, conscious as it is of pain, is immor-<br>
     tal.  And it is this capacity which, in the  world  to  come,  will  be<br>
     present in the bodies of the damned.p. 342, 343<br>
<p>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
                   Biblically, the soul is not immortal:<br>
<p>
Rudolph Bultmann, "Theology of the New Testament", pp. 203,204:<br>
<p>
     Let us cast a glance once again at the doctrine of the  immortality  of<br>
     the  soul.   It cannot be explained by weakness of faith on the part of<br>
     the church that it took over a point of view which  came  from  such  a<br>
     different  source  --  that  of  Greek  philosophy,  and was so utterly<br>
     foreign to its own essential  teaching.   Somewhere  in  the  Christian<br>
     faith there must have been some opening through which this foreign doc-<br>
     trine could penetrate.  Assuredly, from the Biblical standpoint, it  is<br>
     God alone who possesses immortality. The opinion that we men are immor-<br>
     tal because our soul is of an indestructible, divine, essence is,  once<br>
     for all, irreconcilable with the Biblical view of God and man.<br>
<p>
The "Jewish Encyclopedia"<br>
<p>
     The belief that the soul continues its existence after the  dissolution<br>
     of  the  body  is  a matter of philosophical or theological speculation<br>
     rather than of simple  faith,  and  is  accordingly  nowhere  expressly<br>
     taught  in  Holy  Scripture  . . . The belief in the immortality of the<br>
     soul came to the Jews from  contact  with  Greek  thought  and  chiefly<br>
     through the philosophy of Plato, its principal exponent, who was led to<br>
     it through Orphic and Eleusinian  mysteries  in  which  Babylonian  and<br>
     Egyptian views were strangely blended.<br>

     SOUL - . . . . . . . The Mosaic account of the creation of  man  speaks<br>
     of  a  spirit  or breath with which he was endowed by his Creator (Gen.<br>
     2:7); but this spirit was conceived of as inseparably connected, if not<br>
     wholly  identified,  with  the life-blood (Gen. 4:4; Lev. 17:11).  Only<br>
     through the contact of the Jews with Persian and Greek thought did  the<br>
     idea  of a disembodied soul, having its own individuality, take root in<br>
     Judaism . . . .<br>

     "The ancient Church differs most of all from Hellenism in its belief in<br>
     theJResurrection.   Christian  tradition  affirmed the "Resurrection of<br>
     the flesh," which the Apologists opposed to the Hellenistic doctrine of<br>
     the  "Immortality of the soul." The antithesis was conscious and inten-<br>
     tional, for at no point so much as this was  their  opposition  to  the<br>
     Hellenistic  spirit  felt  by the early Christians.  The Platonic, Hel-<br>
     lenistic doctrine of the Immortality of the soul seemed to  the  Apolo-<br>
     gists  a  godless  and  blasphemous doctrine, which above all they must<br>
     attack and destroy.  (Justin, Dial. lxxx.  3-4)  Their  motto  in  this<br>
     regard  might  well  be  Tatian's word: "Not Immortal, O Greeks, is the<br>
     soul in itself, but mortal.  Yet it is possible for  it  not  to  die."<br>

     "The difference between Christian and non-Christian in this matter  was<br>
     so  great that belief in the "Resurrection of the flesh" could become a<br>
     shibboleth.  One who believes in the "Immortality of  the  soul"  shows<br>
     thereby  that he is not a Christian.  As Justin says: "If you have fal-<br>
     len in with some who are called Christians ...  and who say that  there<br>
     is  no  resurrection  of the dead, but that their souls, when they die,<br>

     there is no resurrection of the dead, but that their souls are taken up<br>

     The word "soul" is used in  English  Bibles  to  translate  the  Hebrew<br>
     'nepes'. The translation is unfortunate; soul in common speech reflects<br>
     a complex of ideas which go back to  Greek  philosophy  as  refined  by<br>
     medieval  scholasticism.  In the philosophy of Plato the soul is a pure<br>
     spiritual principle, the subject of thought really  distinct  from  the<br>
     body,  and  immortal; . . . . .  In Aristotelian philosophy the soul is<br>
     united with the body as a form united to matter; it is the  subject  of<br>
     thought  but  its spirituality and immortality are less evident . . . .<br>
     Then NT employs the Greek 'psyche', translated in English as soul . . .<br>
     .  The  NT use of the term is heavily dependent on the OT use and shows<br>
     little or no effect of Greek philosophical concepts . . . .   In  these<br>
     uses, as in the use of 'psyche' to signify life, the NT adds nothing to<br>
     the OT conception of 'nepes' . . . . In  common  speech,  however,  the<br>
     Greek  concept of 'psyche' as a distinct spiritual principle is usually<br>
     read into the term, and thus the concept of salvation and eternal  life<br>
     may  become  Platonic  rather than Biblical.  The 'psyche' in the NT is<br>
     still the totality of the self as a living and conscious  subject,  and<br>
     it is the totality of the self which is saved for eternal life.<br>

     Even a church father like Origen, steeped as he was in  Greek  philoso-<br>
     phy,  discarded  the idea of a pre-existent soul found in Neo-Platonism<br>
     because such a notion was contrary to the Christian concept of  God  as<br>
     the  Creator  of  all  things.   If God alone is eternal and all things<br>
     including man are created by God 'ex nihilo'  [out  of  nothing],  then<br>
     souls  cannot be immortal and uncreated as Plato taught.  Most authori-<br>
     ties agree that an immaterial and immortal soul which is thought of  as<br>
     some  part  of man separable from his mortal body is neither a biblical<br>
     nor a Christian idea.<br>
<p>
George Wisbrock, a Baptist, "Death and the Soul", p. 9<br>
<p>
     ". . . . Yet very few people alive today, if any at all, have  actually<br>
     developed  a belief that they have an immortal "soul" or an "immaterial<br>
     self" dwelling within their physical bodies because of a personal study<br>
     of  the Bible.  Instead, most people have merely accepted whatever they<br>
     have been told about "the soul"  being  both  immaterial  and  immortal<br>
     without ever questioning the basis of that belief.  (Until doing exten-<br>
     sive research for this book, I, too, was  among  those  who  had  never<br>
     questioned  mankind's traditional belief in the immaterial nature of an<br>
     alleged immortal soul living within the human body.)"<br>
<p>
"Death and the Soul", by George Wisbrock, pp 207,208:<br>
<p>
     Plato (427-347 B. C.)  was  greatly  influenced  by  Pythagoras.   Like<br>
     Pythagoras,  Plato  believed an immortal soul dwelt within man and that<br>
     it would separate from man's physical body at death.  He also  believed<br>
     this  immortal soul could reincarnate into another human body, and that<br>
     it would transmigrate into lower class plants and  animals  if  it  had<br>
     been extremely evil in supposed previous lifetimes.<br>
<p>
     Plato further believed that if a particular soul had been "good enough"<br>
     during its period of punishment here on earth, then its perpetual cycle<br>
     of incarnation  and  transmigration  would  cease.   Once  a  soul  had<br>
     redeemed  itself  by appeasing the offended god or goddess who had sent<br>
     it to earth, it would supposedly return to the offended  diety's  pres-<br>
     ence either in the heavens above or in the earth below.<br>
<p>
     Further still, Plato, many of the other  Greek  philosophers,  and  the<br>
     majority  of  the  Greek  population during his lifetime, believed that<br>
     their gods and goddesses were in control of all the  affairs  of  man's<br>
     life  on  earth  --  as  well as of all the alleged spiritual abodes in<br>
     which 'souls' were then believed to reside both before birth and  after<br>
     death.<br>
<p>
     More than any other Greek philosopher, Plato was  responsible  for  the<br>
     spread  into  Western  minds  of  the  false teaching about the alleged<br>
     immortality or the soul and of its assumed ability to  reincarnate  and<br>
     transmigrate  into  various kinds of bodies.  Because of the prominence<br>
     given to Plato as the person most responsible for the development of  a<br>
     belief  in  the  continuation of a soul's life after death, much of our<br>
     current discussion will focus upon what he wrote about  death  and  the<br>
     soul.<br>
<p>
     Plato and Socrates<br>
<p>
     Plato's thinking about the immortality of the soul was no doubt heavily<br>
     influenced  during  his  twenty year stay in Egypt.  He was also influ-<br>
     enced by the thinking of Socrates (469?-399 B.C..), his most  respected<br>
     teacher.  Several  of  Plato's  writings  discuss  Socrates'  life  and<br>
     thoughts about life after death.  Almost all  of  what  we  know  about<br>
     Socrates has come to us form the pen of Plato, who wrote about the last<br>
     days of Socrates' life in his works 'Phaedo,  Euthyphro,  The  Apology,<br>
     and Crito'.<br>
<p>
     Some scholars believe that many  of  the  comments  Plato  ascribed  to<br>
     Socrates  about  the  existence  of an assumed indwelling soul were far<br>
     more an expression of his own thinking than they were of Socrates' per-<br>
     sonal beliefs . . . . . .<br>
<p>
F. F. Bruce, the late Emeritus Professor, University of Manchester, England.<br>
<p>
     It would be a great step forward if those who set themselves to expound<br>
     the  Biblical  teaching  on  these matters defined their terms clearly.<br>
     This is particularly so with the terms  "immortal"  and  "immortality".<br>
     In  Biblical  usage immortality belongs inherently to God alone; other-<br>
     wise it belongs only to those to whom God gives it.  Again, where human<br>
     beings  are  concerned,  Immortality  in the Bible is predicated of the<br>
     body, not of the soul.<br>
<p>
     In our western culture, thought and  language  about  immortality  have<br>
     been  largely  determined by Plato's doctrine of the immortality of the<br>
     soul.  But any attempt to combine Plato's doctrine with the teaching of<br>
     the Bible can lead only to confusion.  For Plato did not mean by immor-<br>
     tality what the biblical writers mean by it, and what  Plato  meant  by<br>
     the soul is not what the biblical writers mean by the soul.<br>
<p>
     For the Christian, the  hope  of  immortality  is  bound  up  with  the<br>
     resurrection  of Christ, who "has brought life and immortality to light<br>
     through the gospel."  By His conquest of death Christ has made . . . .<br>

     "I cannot show from Scripture that man is naturally  immortal.   I  can<br>
     only  deduce it.  The idea of the immortality of the soul has no source<br>
     in the gospel; it comes, on the contrary, from the Platonists,  and  it<br>
     is  just  when the second coming of Christ was denied in the Church, or<br>
     at least began to be lost sight of, that the doctrine of the  immortal-<br>
     ity  of the soul came in to replace that of the resurrection.  This was<br>
     about the time of Origen."<br>

     lectual  soul is mortal, seeing, according to the canon of Pope Clement<br>
     V, that the soul is [...] immortal [...] and we  decree  that  all  who<br>

     "We should learn to view our death in the right light, so that we  need<br>
     not  become  alarmed  on  account  of  it, as unbelief does; because in<br>
     Christ it is indeed not death, but a fine, sweet and brief sleep, which<br>
     brings  us  release from this vale of tears, from sin and from the fear<br>
     and extremity of real death and from all the misfortunes of this  life,<br>
     and  we shall be secure and without care, rest sweetly and gently for a<br>
     brief moment, as on a sofa, until the  time  when  he  shall  call  and<br>
     awaken  us together with all his dear children to his eternal glory and<br>
     joy . . .  "For since we call it a sleep, we know  that  we  shall  not<br>
     remain  in it, but be again awakened and live, and that the time during<br>
     which we sleep, shall seem no longer than if we had just fallen asleep.<br>
     Hence,  we shall censure ourselves that we were surprised or alarmed at<br>
     such a sleep in the hour of death, and suddenly come alive out  of  the<br>
     grave  and  from  decomposition, and entirely well, fresh, with a pure,<br>
     clear, glorified life, meet our Lord and Saviour Jesus  Christ  in  the<br>
     clouds  .  .  .   "Scripture everywhere affords such consolation, which<br>
     speaks of the death of the saints, as if  they  fell  asleep  and  were<br>
     gathered  to  their  fathers,  that is, had overcome death through this<br>
     faith and comfort in Christ, and  awaited  the  resurrection,  together<br>
     with the saints who preceded them in death."<br>

William Tyndale, another Reformer<br>
<p>
     "In putting in heaven, hell, or purgatory  you  destroy  the  arguments<br>
     wherewith Christ and Paul prove the resurrection.  [...] The true faith<br>
     putteth the resurrection; the heathen philosophers, denying  that,  did<br>
     put  that souls did ever live.  And the Pope joineth the spiritual doc-<br>
     trine of Christ and the fleshly doctrine of the  philosophers  together<br>
     --  things  so  contrary that they cannot agree.  [...] And because the<br>
     fleshly minded Pope consenteth to heathen doctrine, therefore  he  cor-<br>

     me what cause is there for the resurrection?"<br>
<p>
William Tyndale, Bible translator and Martyr (1484-1536)<br>
<p>
     Tyndale supported Luther in the revived teaching of conditional  immor-<br>
     tality,  and  it  brought   him into direct conflict with the church of<br>
     Rome - "The true faith setteth forth  the  resurrection,  which  we  be<br>
     warned to look for every hour.  The heathen philosophers, denying that,<br>
     did set forth that the souls did ever live.  And the Pope  joineth  the<br>
     spiritual  doctrine  of Christ and the fleshly doctrine of philosophers<br>
     together; things so contrary that they cannot agree, no more  than  the<br>
     spirit  and  the  flesh do in a Christian man. And because the fleshly-<br>

<p>
Lutherin writer J. A. Kantonen in "The Christian Hope", pp. 28,29:<br>
<p>
     It has been characteristic of Western thought ever since Plato to  dis-<br>
     tinguish  sharply  between the soul and the body.  The body is supposed<br>
     to be composed of matter, and the soul of spirit.  The body is a prison<br>
     from  which  the  soul is liberated at death to carry on its own proper<br>
     nonphysical existence.  Because of its immaterial spiritual nature  the<br>
     soul has been considered indestructible . . .<br>
<p>
     This way of thinking is entirely foreign  to the Bible.  True to Scrip-<br>
     ture and definitely rejecting the Greek view, the Christian creed says,<br>
     not "I believe in the immortality of the soul" but "I  believe  in  the<br>
     resurrection of the body."<br>
<p>
     ". . . . The soul is not a separate part of man,  constituting  a  sub-<br>
     stance  of its own.  It would be more in keeping with the New Testament<br>
     to speak of soul-life rather than of the soul as such.  'Psuche' is the<br>
     uniqueness  or  the individuality of a particular life, not some separ-<br>
     able indestructible substance.<br>
<p>
Wesleyan scholar, J.A. Beet, "Immortality of the Soul", pp. 53,54:<br>
<p>
     The phrase, "The soul immortal', so frequent  and  conspicuous  in  the<br>
     writings  of  Plato, we have not found in pre-Christian literature out-<br>
     side the influence of Greek Philosophy; nor have we found it in  Chris-<br>
     tian  literature  until  the later part of the second century.  We have<br>
     noticed that all the earliest Christian writers  who  use  this  phrase<br>
     were  familiar  with the teachings of Plato; that one of these, Tertul-<br>
     lian, expressly refers both the phrase and doctrine to  him;  and  that<br>
     the  early  Christian writers never support this doctrine by appeals to<br>
     the Bible, but only by arguments similar to those of Plato . . .  .  We<br>
     have  failed  to find any trace of this doctrine in the Bible . . .  It<br>
     is altogether alien, both in phrase and thought, to  the  teachings  of<br>
     Christ and his apostles.<br>

Hebrew structure -- Merrill F. Unger, "Unger's Bible Handbook", p. 267:<br>
<p>
     Hebrew poetry, unlike Occidental verse, does not posses meter or rhyme.<br>
     Its  basic  structure is parallelism of thought arrangement rather than<br>
     word  arrangements.   Common  types  of  such   parallelism   are   (1)<br>
     'synonymous  parallelism',  where  the second line or stich repeats the<br>
     first, giving a distich or couplet (cf. Job 3:11-12; 4:17; Ps 2:4); (2)<br>
     'antithetic parallelism', in which the second line presents a contrast-<br>
     ing thought to emphasize the first  (Job 42:5;  Ps  34:10);  (3)  'syn-<br>
     thetic  parallelism',  in  which  the second and succeeding lines add a<br>
     progressive flow of thought to develop the first (Job 4:19-21; Ps 1:3).<br>

     The Soul in the OT means not a part of man, but, the whole man  --  man<br>
     as  a living being.  Similarly, in the NT it signifies human life:  the<br>
     life of the individual, conscious subject . . . . the  Bible  does  not<br>
     speak of the survival of an immaterial soul.  This is not surprising if<br>
     one considers that categories of Greek philosophy are not likely to  be<br>
     found in Semitic copies of literature.<br>
<p>
"New Catholic Encyclopedia", Vol. 18 (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967), p. 449:<br>
<p>
     Nepes comes from an original root probably meaning to breathe, and thus<br>
     the noun form means neck or throat opened for breathing, thence, breath<br>
     of life. Since breath distinguishes the living  from  the  dead,  nepes<br>
     came  to mean life or self or simply individual life.  Nepes is used in<br>
     regard to both  animals  and  humans.   If  life  is  human,  nepes  is<br>
     equivalent  to the person, the "I." After death the nepes goes to sheol<br>
     [the grave].<br>
<p>
     The above summary indicates that there is no dichotomy of body and soul<br>
     in the OT.  The Israelite saw things concretely, in their totality, and<br>
     thus he considered men as persons and  not  as  composites.   The  term<br>
     'nepes,'  though  translated by our word soul, never means soul as dis-<br>
     tinct from the body or the individual person.  Other words  in  the  OT<br>
     such  as  spirit,  flesh,  and  heart also signify the human person and<br>
     differ only as various aspects of the same being.<br>

     group of high-frequency equivalents for the term.  The KJV  alone  uses<br>
     over  28 different English terms for this one Hebrew word.  The problem<br>
     with the English term "soul" is that no actual equivalent of  the  term<br>
     or  the  idea  behind  it  is  represented in the Hebrew language.  The<br>
     Hebrew system of thought does not include the combination or opposition<br>
     of  the  terms  "body"  and "soul," which are really Greek and Latin in<br>
     origin.<br>

     " . . . . . since Hebrew rejects repeating the same noun in both halves<br>
     of  a  poetic  line,  nephesh  is  often  used  as the parallel for the<br>
     speaker, primary personal subject, and even for God, as in Ps. 11:5.<br>
<p>
     " . . . . Such passages are frequent, and a proper understanding of the<br>
     word  [nephesh]  enlightens  many  well  known  passages,  such  as Ps.<br>
     119:109: "My life [nephesh] is continually in my hand,  Yet  I  do  not<br>
     forget Thy law" (NASB)<br>

"The Zondrevan Pictoral Encyclopedia of the Bible, Vol. 5 , p. 496:<br>
<p>
     The English translation of 'nephesh' by the term "soul" has  too  often<br>
     been  misunderstood as teaching a bipartite (soul and body): dichotomy)<br>
     or  tripartite  (body,  soul  and  spirit:  trichotomy)   anthropology.<br>
     Equally  misleading is the interpretation which too radically separates<br>
     soul from body as in the Greek view of human nature.  Porteus states it<br>
     well  when  he  says,  "The  Hebrew could not conceive of a disembodied<br>
     nephesh, though he could use 'nephesh' with or  without  the  adjective<br>
     'dead,' for corpse (e.g., Lev 19:28; Num 6:6)" (ibid).  Or as R.B. Lau-<br>
     rin has suggested.  "To the Hebrew, man was not a 'body' and  a  'soul'<br>
     but  rather  a  'body-soul,' a unity of vital power"  (cf. BDT, sS.V.).<br>
     The most significant text is Genesis 2:7, "then the Lord God formed man<br>
     of  the dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath<br>
     of life; and man became a living being [nephesh]."<br>

"The Encyclopedia Dictionary of the Bible", p. 2287:<br>
<p>
     The original meaning of 'nefes' and the  concepts  that  are  connected<br>
     with  it  show  that  the 'nefes' (like the ruah) of a man was not con-<br>
     sidered in Israel to be a sort of duplicate of him, as the 'ka' was  in<br>
     Egypt, or the 'psuche' among the ancient Greeks (e.g., Hom. Iliad 1,3),<br>
     or was whatever words various primitive people have for the "soul."<br>
<p>
     (C) It is sometimes thought  that  the  Isrealites  believed  that  the<br>
     'nefes'  could exist apart from the body and that, after a man's death,<br>
     his 'nefes' continued to exist in the nether world.  But the OT  really<br>
     gives  no  basis  for  such  an opinion.  When it speaks of rescuing or<br>
     delivering a man's 'nefes' from  the  nether  world  (Ps  30:3;  86:13;<br>
     89:49; 116:4; Is 38:17; Prv 23:14), it means no more than that this man<br>
     is saved from dying (cfr. Ps 33:19; 56:14; 78:50; Jb 33:18, 22, 28)  or<br>
     that  he  was snatched from mortal danger; in all these cases the man's<br>
     'nefes' is merely a synonym for the man himself, with some emphasis  on<br>
     him  as a "living" being (cfr., e.g., the parallelism in Ps 16:10, "You<br>
     will not abandon my 'nefes' to the nether world, nor  will  You  suffer<br>
     Your  faithful one to undergo corruption"; so also in Ps 49:16; cfr. Jb<br>
     13:14, where "my nefes" is parallel to "my flesh").<br>

     Man became a 'soul' because God, who alone  was  the  Living  One,  had<br>
     breathed  into  his  nostrils the breath of life.  This soul was not in<br>
     itself immortal . . . .  The  Greek  word  'psyche',  like  the  Hebrew<br>
     'nephesh',  may  be  translated not only by 'soul,' but also by 'life,'<br>
     'person,' or even by a pronoun: 'I' or 'someone.'<br>

     "Far from being a "part" which joins with the body to  form  the  human<br>
     being,  the soul denotes the entire man, insofar as he is animated by a<br>
     spirit of life . . . A soul is a man, it is someone . . . .<br>
<p>
     The concept of the body common in the N.T. defines  man  as  a  complex<br>
     organism,  a  whole,  a  unity.   It  is  not  simply the "form" of the<br>
     organism, as opposed to the substance which might be its content, but a<br>
     mode of being essential to and constitutive of the human person.  There<br>
     is no human existence  which  is  not  bodily  existence  (cf.  1  Cor.<br>

<p>
     Mankind has breath, or spirit . . . when a person dies  the  spirit  is<br>
     returned to God (Ecc 12:7).  Life and death, therefore, are represented<br>
     in the Bible as a giving and a withdrawing of God's breath, or  spirit;<br>
     for  all  created life, including humanity, is utterly dependent on Him<br>
     (Ps. 104). . . . As the principle of life, spirit is ascribed to beasts<br>
     also (Gen. 6:17; 7:15).<br>
<p>
"New Catholic Encyclopedia", Vol 13, p. 517:<br>
<p>
     Since God is the life-giver, life breath comes from Him and  man  lives<br>
     as long as God's breath remains in Him (Jb 27:3; Is 42:5; Za 12:1). . .<br>
     .  In creatures with lungs, breathing is a natural sign of life, and in<br>
     many  languages the term connoting physical breath takes on the meaning<br>
     of what it signifies, life.  So in Hebrew, 'ruach' came to mean  breath<br>
     as  significative of life in men (Gn 6:17; Ez 37:10) and in animals (Gn<br>
     7:22; Ps 104: 29).<br>

     For the Hebrews man is of the earth; he is flesh, Isa.  31:3.   In  the<br>
     post-  exilic  period  'Spirit' became a virtual synonym for 'soul' and<br>
     'heart', the seat of intelligence and emotion in  man  (cf.  Job  20:3,<br>
     32:18,  Isa  57:15,  Dan 5:20).  Human characteristics are described in<br>
     'spiritual' terms.<br>
<p>
"A Theological Word Book of the Bible", p. 144:<br>
<p>
     SOUL (nephesh) means the living being.  We might render it 'person'  or<br>
     'personality',  so  long  as we remember that in Hebrew thought even an<br>
     animal is a 'nephesh' . . .<br>
<p>
     SPIRIT (ruach), liberally wind, and in a  person,  breath,  means  that<br>
     which is the mark of the living as opposed to the dead.  This, however,<br>
     does not distinguish it from soul (nephesh), and one would  be  tempted<br>
     to  make a distinction by calling 'ruach' the whole non-physical aspect<br>
     of man were it not that it is difficult to say that the Hebrews did not<br>
     conceive both  'ruach' and 'nephesh' as in some way physical and having<br>
     substance, modern notions of immateriality being beyond them.  Pedersen<br>
     differentiates  thus:  "'ruach' is the motive power of the 'soul'" (op.<br>
     cit., p. 105), and illustrates from Ezra 1:1  'The Lord stirred up  the<br>
     spirit  of  Cyrus',  i.e.  moved  Cyrus to do something, similarly Hag.<br>
     1:14.  "Ruach' is frequently used of mental processes, especially viva-<br>
     city, impulse, anger.<br>
<p>
"Zondervan Pictoral Encyclopedia of the Bible", p. 497:<br>
<p>
     It should be noted that the  NT  does  not  make  a  clear  distinction<br>
     between  'psuche'  and 'pneuma' (spirit).  First Thessalonians 5:23 and<br>
     Hebrews 4:12 are exceptions, and can best be understood not as  affirm-<br>
     ing  a  trichotomous  anthropology but as figures of speech . . . .  To<br>
     derive exact psychological descriptions from these  two  statements  is<br>
     pressing the non-technical language of Scriptures too far.<br>

     ". . . . this does not necessarily mean that he [Paul] regards these as<br>
     three  distinct  elements in man rather than as three different aspects<br>

     "Thou  shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy<br>
     soul and with all thy mind," in Matt. 22:37, He does not have  in  mind<br>

     On Justin Martyr (A.D. 100-163) -- In the fragment of his  treatise  on<br>

     the soul, the soul the dwelling of the  spirit."   We  find  a  similar<br>
     statement  in  his  dialogue  with Trypho; he makes Trypho say, "As the<br>
     body without the soul is dead, so is the soul  without  the  quickening<br>
     spirit (zootikon pneuma)," proving that Justin thought this distinction<br>
     to be  one  recognized  by  Jews  as  well  as  Christians.   Similarly<br>
     Irenaeus,  "The  soul  and the spirit are certainly a part of man, cer-<br>
     tainly not the man; for the perfect man consists in the coming and  the<br>
     union of the soul receiving the Spirit of the Father, and the admixture<br>
     of the fleshly  nature  which  was  molded  after  the  image  of  God"<br>

     body,  soul,  spirit, but as a multidimensional unity . . . .  In every<br>
     dimension of life, all dimensions are potentially or actually present .<br>
     . . .  He is a unity which unites all dimensions.  This doctrine stands<br>
     against the dualistic theory which sees man as  composed  of  soul  and<br>
     body;  or  body  and mind; or body, soul, and spirit, etc.  Man is one,<br>

     The term soul is being  used  less  and  less  in  current  theological<br>
     thought and literature.  Even religious literature, sermons, and modern<br>
     translations of the Bible avoid the word soul.   For  example,  if  one<br>
     turns  to  Matthew  16:26,  he  discovers  that the Greek word for soul<br>
     (psyche) is translated "soul" in the King James Version and by Moffatt,<br>
     but as "life" in the Revised Standard Version and by Weymouth, and with<br>
     the word "self" in the new English Bible. All of which  indicates  that<br>
     in  modern  English and American usage terms like self, ego, life, per-<br>
     son, or personality are being used in preference to the word soul.<br>

Hades, Sheol == Grave not Hell:<br>
<p>
"The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible", Vol. 1, p. 788:<br>
<p>
     Nowhere in the Old Testament is the abode of the  dead  regarded  as  a<br>
     place  of  punishment  or  torment.   The concept of an infernal "hell"<br>
     developed in Israel only during the Hellenistic period , probably under<br>
     the influence of Iranian ideas.<br>
<p>
"The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia", p. 1314:<br>
<p>
     The Greek conception of Hades was that of  a  locality  receiving  into<br>
     itself  all the dead, but divided into two regions, one a place of tor-<br>
     ment, the other of blessedness.  This conception should not  be  rashly<br>
     transferred to the NT, for the latter stands not under the influence of<br>
     Greek pagan belief, but gives a teaching and reflects  a  belief  which<br>
     model  their  idea of Hades upon the OT through the Septuagent.  The OT<br>
     Sheol, while formally resembling the Greek Hades in that it is the com-<br>
     mon  receptacle  of  all the dead, differs from it, on the one hand, by<br>
     the absence of a clearly defined division into two parts, and,  on  the<br>
     other  hand,  by  the emphasis placed on its association with death and<br>
     the grave as abnormal facts following in the wake of sin.<br>
<p>
Zondervan's 1985 "Expository Dictionary of Bible Words", p. 336:<br>
<p>
     Sheol: the realm of death.  A look at the concordance shows that the OT<br>
     says little about hell.  Some feel that the OT term 'Sheol' in the NASB<br>
     but translated "the  grave"  or  "the  realm  of  death"  in  the  NIV,<br>
     represents the OT conception of hell.<br>
<p>
     However, such arguments are unsatisfactory, and it is  best  to  under-<br>
     stand 'sheol' as a poetic synonym for 'geber,' "grave."  Thus there are<br>
     no references to eternal destiny but simply to the grave as the resting<br>
     place  of  the  bodies  of  all  people (e.g., Job 17:13-16; 24:19,20).<br>
     Deliverance from 'sheol' is  rescue  from  impending  death  or  future<br>
     punishment (e.g. Ps 89:48).<br>

     wicked was associated with 'sheol'.  The good and the bad alike, tyrant<br>

     as the opposite of heaven, may also be considered as arising  from  the<br>
     reference to the tomb, remembering that in antiquity burial shafts were<br>
     often deep in the earth (Deut 32:22; Ps 139:8; etc.).  There is no hint<br>

     The ancient Church inherited from Greek thought the notion of  a  soul-<br>
     substance  which  was by nature immortal, and this conception was often<br>
     intertwined with biblical teaching about resurrection.   In the  bibli-<br>
     cal view a man dies and literally ceases to exist . . . .  On the Greek<br>
     view death is merely a change in the manner of existence.<br>

I think the issue of authoritarian leadership runs deeper than any <br>
individual administrator.  Anyone acquainted with the president of the <br>
Illinois Conference, B.J. Christensen, (soon may be heading for Southern<br>
California), knows he is one of the ultimate peacemakers and consensus<br>
builders.  But it takes more than one to build consensus, and you will find<br>
that Illinois has its quota or more of ex-pastors as a result.  Not<br>
necessarily as a function of the conference leadership or the pastors<br>
themselves, but as a result of a system that lets anyone thumping a Bible<br>
or Ellen G. White demand an authoritarian application of that particular<br>
point.  I think if we were to examine the situation closely we would<br>
find that authoritarianism is deeply rooted in the church membership,<br>
and we have <br>
a system that allows each individual church member to be an authoritarian.<br>

Steve friend, you nearly slipped off the fence on this one : )<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Would it be a tendency to downplay or attack the law to</i><br>
<i>&gt;build up the gospel?</i><br>
<p>
But you redeemed your balancing skills here:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or perhaps a behavior to pigeonhole God into a particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;"sweet loving Jesus" box or  "big bad God" box?</i><br>

THE QUESTIONS:<br>
<p>
   1.  How should the hours of the Sabbath be kept?<br>
   <br>
   2.  Can I justify my position (on Sabbath keeping) from the Bible?<br>
<p>
-----<br>
<p>
   The first question is simple enough, but I've found that the answer is <br>
anything but straightforward.  The second question is what prompted this post<br>
to SDAnet.<br>
<p>
   Reasons.  Reasons?  Reasons!  Why must one have reasons for doing the <br>
things one does?  If a person focused on having a close enough relationship <br>
with God, then wouldn't s/he be convicted of what was right/wrong?  Why then <br>
must one have physical, concrete reasons?  Does one's Christian walk have to <br>
be REASONable? or can we rely on tradition and/or convictions (feelings?).<br>
<p>
   I am an Engineer, and thus prefer to have well-defined beliefs.  Although<br>
I don't need to have formulas as such, nevertheless I try to have definite,<br>
well defined principles for the things I do (and don't do).  This way, I <br>
can keep from adopting the hypocritical tendencies which Jesus denounced<br>
(Matt 23:25, many other texts).<br>
<p>
   I believe that the Bible should be our main source of truth.  This isn't<br>
to say that the writings of Ellen White and other books are irrelevent.  On<br>
the contrary!  I often gain many spiritual blessings from the writings of EGW, <br>
and believe that her writings are very relevent and appropriate today.  I just<br>
believe that when it comes to defining beliefs, then we should base our <br>
decisions fully on God's word.<br>
<p>
   OK, ok, enough of defining positions.  The meat of the question is:  Show<br>
me from the Bible, some simple, quality principles for how we should spend our <br>
time on Sabbath.  Simple enough?  Not really!  I have come to the conclusion <br>
that either my standards are needlessly high, or most members of the SDA <br>
church are hypocrites when it comes to Sabbath observance.<br>
<p>
<p>
EXAMPLES -- EXAMPLES -- EXAMPLES -- EXAMPLES -- EXAMPLES -- EXAMPLES <br>
<p>
Sabbath Afternoon Activities???<br>
-------------------------------<br>
<p>
Rock-climbing with ropes and gear <br>
An exertive hike (scrambling) up a mountain<br>
A leisurely stroll through the woods <br>
Sitting around the living room, talking<br>
<p>
Playing a competitive game of basketball or soccer<br>
Shooting baskets for the fun of it<br>
Playing "catch" with a base-ball or throwing a frisbee<br>
Skipping rocks across a lake<br>
Playing a game of charades or Bible trivia<br>
<p>
Studying for classes, doing homework<br>
Doing only homework for Bible classes<br>
Watching a nature special on the Discovery Channel<br>
Reading National Geographics<br>
<p>
Sleeping through Sabbath School<br>
Sleeping most of the afternoon  <br>
<p>
Sabbath afternoon discussions:<br>
   Discussing Adventist doctrines<br>
   Secular things<br>
   Gossipping<br>
   Normal socializing (not necessarily religious in nature)<br>
<p>
Leaf-raking for the elderly (non-SDA's)<br>
   This was quite a controvertial one on WWC campus.  The Bible clearly <br>
   states that no work should be done on the Sabbath (Ex 20:8, Heb. 4:9,10),<br>
   but Jesus also said it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath (Matt 12:12).<br>
<p>
NOTE:  Even though these examples might sound very legalistic in nature,<br>
====   what I'm trying to find are the driving principles behind these <br>
       situations.<br>
<p>
<p>
TEXTS -- TEXTS -- TEXTS -- TEXTS -- TEXTS -- TEXTS<br>
<p>
   From what I could find in the concordance on Sabbath keeping, most of<br>
the texts deal with refraining from work on the Sabbath  (Ex 20:8; 35:2).<br>
Other texts require that it not be "desecrated" (Isa 56:2,6), and that it<br>
be kept as a sign between us and God (Eze 20:20).<br>
<p>
   How did Jesus spend the Sabbath hours?  Preaching, teaching, healing, <br>
and arguing doctrines with the Pharisees (Matt 12:1-13; Luke 13:10-16).<br>
Notice that he went out of his way *NOT* to stop healing on the Sabbath.<br>
(Wasn't he being a stumbling block to the Pharisees?)<br>
<p>
   Now for the troubling text:  "If you keep... from doing as you please<br>
on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight... if you honor it by <br>
not going your own way, doing as you please, or speaking idle words, <br>
then you will find your joy in the Lord..."  Isa 58:13-14<br>
<p>
   How can I keep from doing as I please, yet be expected to call the <br>
Sabbath a delight?  Does this text mean I can't do anything fun on<br>
Sabbath?  What exactly constitutes "doing as one pleases?"<br>
<p>
<p>
***********************<br>
***  Your Turn Now  ***<br>
***********************<br>
<p>
   Well, I've done quite enough talking thus far.  Now I would like to<br>
hear from you.  Do you have specific suggestions about:<br>
<p>
  -- Answers to some of the questions above?<br>
  -- Guiding principles for appropriate Sabbath activities?<br>
  -- Bible texts to support those principles?<br>
<p>
   Thanks.<br>

I recently attended an alumni reunion where one of the honored alumni<br>
was said to have "two adult children."  In the current climate with the<br>
popularity of the group "Adult Children Of Alcoholics", I thought <br>
to myself, "this guy must have done something wrong."<br>
<p>
But then I thought, well what about God?  With all the dysfunctional<br>
relationships that occur with God, there must be some people who have<br>
failed to grow up and are now "adult children"<br>
<p>
If there were a support group for "Adult Children of God", what would <br>
it's twelve steps be?  Is our church already a support group of sorts <br>
for these type of people?  What would characterize such people?  Would<br>
it be the aversion to any type of authority?  Would it be a tendency to <br>
downplay or attack the law to build up the gospel?  Or perhaps a behavior<br>
to pigeonhole God into a particular "sweet loving Jesus" box or  "big<br>
bad God" box?<br>
<p>
<p>
Inquiring minds want to know.<br>

Style of leadership assumes "style."<br>
<p>
As for evangelistic efforts, I'd be very interested in how you think<br>
those of us who are charged with the responsibility for allocation of<br>
church resources [I am a layperson who has often been a part of the<br>
governance structure, e.g., conference committee, college/university<br>
trustee] should evaluate the value of varying types of evangelism.  For<br>
example, suppose we discovered that evangelistic efforts cost us<br>
$1,000 per "recruit" [baptism], but programs in schools cost us<br>
$500 per "recruit"?  Or that efforts in Spanish-speaking groups cost<br>
us $500 per baptism, but in one of the Asian languages the cost was<br>
$10,000 per baptism?  What if the Anglo effort cost $25,000 per baptism,<br>
but running health clinics in the local church cost us $1,250 per<br>
baptism?  Would that information be relevant?  <br>
<p>
What are appropriate measures for performance in a church setting?<br>
<p>
[All numbers are purely hypothetical!!!]  Is baptism a proper surrogate<br>
for "success"?  Do the gospels speak of the number of baptisms Christ<br>
achieved?<br>

As a rider to Steve's comments on "Adult Children" in the church:<br>
<p>
I have often wondered why the church tends to attract "odd" people.  I <br>
propose it is because of one of two reasons:<br>
<p>
     1.  Odd people are made to feel welcome in our church environment.<br>
<p>
     2.  Our message is sold in such a way that it is attractive to odd<br>
         people.<br>
<p>
What bothers me, is that I havn't worked out yet which one it is!<br>
<p>
Or are there other reasons?<br>

It's interesting that Ellen White recommended a non-authoritarian<br>
system of church government with 3 or 4 gc presidents around the<br>
world.  I suppose one for each world division, and no one above<br>
them.  Like the 12 apostles with only Christ above them.  It would<br>
give the church a less centralized system.  But her suggestions were<br>
rejected by the GC -- the vote was 60 to 20 or something -- in<br>
1901 or 1903, I don't remember which.  She was crushed and wrote<br>
about it being the greatest disappointment of her life.  The<br>
leaders rejected her explicit counsel;  one of them even said,<br>
It's OK to have a central president, as long as he respects the<br>
counsels of the Lord through Sister White.  At the same time as<br>
they were rejecting her counsel.<br>
<p>
The church leaders are human like us all and the human tendency<br>
is to centralize power more and more.  I think Folkenberg is trying<br>
to reverse this.<br>

The Greater New York Adventist Forum Chapter (which meets at Columbia<br>
University, Manhattan), had an interesting meeting this past Sabbath.<br>
In the afternoon we had a discussion lead by Kendra Haloviak (Religion<br>
Dept Columbia Union College) with assistance from Roy Branson (editor<br>
of Spectrum).  After reviewing some of the event in Waco and telling<br>
reactions of some they knew that had relatives in the compound at<br>
Waco, they posed three questions.  I thought that perhaps some of you<br>
would find the questions interesting ponder.<br>
<p>
1.  What would you say were the primary differences between<br>
    traditional Seventh-day Adventism and the Branch Davidians?<br>
<p>
2.  What would you say were the primary similarities between<br>
    traditional Seventh-day Adventism and the Branch Davidians?<br>
<p>
3.  What lessons should we personally and the SDA church learn from<br>
    the experiences at Waco?<br>
<p>
We spend a very interesting 2 hours discussing these.  I will not<br>
attempt to give you a summary of the discussion -- it is most valuable<br>
to answer attempt your own answers anyway rather than hear those of<br>
others, but to get you started here is one of my own set of partial<br>
answers.<br>
<p>
#2: Similarities: I think that Seventh-day Adventism and the Davidians<br>
    share a similar basic apocalypticism.  Each believe that current<br>
    events should be viewed as part of a cosmic drama leading to the<br>
    end of current history.  I don't know enough about Branch Davidian<br>
    beliefs to know which details differ.<br>
<p>
#1: Differences: I think that our responses to apocalyptic events<br>
    differ.  Growing up in the church, I was presented with images<br>
    from Matthew of "running to the hills", of possible martyrdom, of<br>
    standing up before judges and defending our beliefs, of being<br>
    especially careful to make right decisions as probation might have<br>
    closed, but it was never suggested that Adventists might hole up<br>
    in a compound under siege and physically defend ourselves with<br>
    ammunition.<br>
<p>
#3: Lessons:  Perhaps, Seventh-day Adventists have spent too much<br>
    effort on teaching its members on how to recognize last day events<br>
    and too little on how to respond to them.<br>
<p>
Try some answers for yourself.<br>

The organization began in a small building in Southern California, in<br>
the early 1950's.  From the beginning their focus was on serving people.<br>
 The <br>
people whom they served always thought they were treated fairly and enjoyed<br>
the service.  One of the suppliers of the organization came to visit and was<br>
amazed at the amount of equipment they needed for their food service.  He <br>
soon bought the entire organization and began opening branches, first across<br>
America, then around the world.<br>
<p>
As the organization spread out, they maintained a strict uniformity in their<br>
service.  The same product was served all over the world, with few if any <br>
variations permitted.  Patrons were urged to take what was served and<br>
not ask for substitutions.  Often raw materials for the products were<br>
imported <br>
from America.  This organization became a symbol of America all over the <br>
world and was known by American travelers abroad as a place where English<br>
would always be spoken.  Despite this rigidity, or perhaps because of it,<br>
the organization has always been very profitable, and currently faces the <br>
crisis of altering its signs because they can only show "99 BILLION SERVED"<br>
and they have now served more than that.  I speak, of course, of McDonald's.<br>
<p>
What can the SDA church learn from McDonald's about rigidity and its effects?<br>
Since the vegetarians of Berrien Springs, MI have made that McDonalds one of <br>
the few in the USA to offer a vegetarian sandwich at a discount, we know that<br>
even McDonalds (which admits to throwing all customer suggestions in the<br>
trash heap) can bend with time.  Should the SDA church do the same?<br>
<p>
What is the core of our business and what is the cultural wrapping it<br>
comes in?  Is our church training all our new converts overseas to be<br>
Seventh-day<br>
Americans? Is Jesus the sushi of life and the tortilla of life as well <br>
as the bread of life?  Can we separate the gospel from the rugged<br>
individualism that Americans of all denominations attach to it?  I<br>
believe that we can and must.<br>

I am not so sure that McDonalds in Berrien Springs sells a vegetarian<br>
sandwich for less.  A couple of weeks ago Lorena went in to ask for such<br>
and was told that they could leave out the meat but would be charged the<br>
full price.<br>
<p>
Burger King, on the other hand, gives a nice discount for a Vege-Whopper.<br>
<p>
<p>
Mcdonalds may have changed or Lorena may have just gotten someone who<br>
didn't know of this policy.<br>

I am the 'keeper' of the NAAP postal mailing list, and I should now add E-Mail<br>

so I am thinking that you may be a source for some of this data.  Do you<br>
ything I can download?  I have not contacted SDAnet as yet; this might<br>
be the source.   Any info would be appreciated.   Thanks<br>

Responding to two questions:  <br>
<p>
1)  Why do we attract the "odd people"?  <br>
<p>
Although I am not at all sure that this statement is quantitatively true,<br>
we do have our share.  Quantitative surveys are always frustrated because<br>
it's hard to know whether or not to count oneself into the total.<br>
<p>
Several factors contribute:<br>
    a)  SDA churches are generally metropolitan churches, not community<br>
        churches.  Thus there is no selection effect due to location.<br>
        An SDA church is more likely to draw from all socioeconomic strata.<br>
    <br>
    b)  The common ground of forming an SDA church is doctrinally based,<br>
        not a group of people with common goals and interests.  To join <br>
        the SDA church one must inherently be a nonconformist.<br>
<p>
    c)  The SDA church preaches exclusivism.  Few ministers say we are the<br>
        only way to get to heaven anymore, but most still say we are the<br>
             best. (and well they should.)  For those who turn to<br>
religion <br>
        seeking internal security (the vast majority), an exclusive<br>
        advantage is very appealing.<br>
<p>
    d)  The SDA church has more than our share of saintly persons who take<br>
        an interest in these "odd people" and get them involved in coming<br>
        to church and learning about the SDA message.<br>
<p>
Church wouldn't be church without them.  I have been to churches that <br>
were on purpose constructed 30 miles out of downtown in a ritzy suburb,<br>
thus using transportation to screen out the inner-city people and the <br>
disabled and handicapped.  It feels so artificial there.  Church isn't<br>
meant to be a collection of people just like me, and I hope everyone<br>
is grateful for that.<br>
<p>
<p>
2)  Did I "slip off the fence", or nearly so, as Marcus suggested?<br>
<p>
Well, maybe I didn't explain myself as well as I could have.  "Adult<br>
Children Of God" is not a precise enough term to cover all the different<br>
behaviors<br>
I was mentioning, and besides, the Bible says that we are and will always <br>
be children of God.  Perhaps "Recovering legalists", "Co-legalists",<br>
and "adult children of legalists" are more descriptive terms for the<br>
behaviors I'm trying to describe.  All three of these groups have in common<br>
the behavior of ignoring or explaining away scriptural evidence that doesn't<br>
fit their rigid pictures of God and how to relate to Him.<br>
<p>
I see the "recovering legalist" as one who says the right words about <br>
how salvation happens, but between every sentence adds a caveat from the <br>
book of James.  <br>
<p>
The "co-legalist" is not a legalist at all, in fact is the opposite.<br>
When pressed the co-legalist will say that one does need to obey God.<br>
But the rest of the time is spent beating the rubber chicken of legalism<br>
wherever it is found and many places that it is not.  The "co-legalist"<br>
is co-dependent on the legalist in the sense that if there were no legalism<br>
to attack, he would have nothing to say.  <br>
<p>
The "Adult Children of Legalists" are often those who had bad experiences<br>
with church rules and regulations while growing up.  But instead of<br>
recognizing that the rules were simply misapplied, they conclude that <br>
the rules and regulations, and the church that made them, are wrong.<br>
Often, however, they will attack the rules and rule-makers using the same<br>
intolerant attitude and narrow-mindedness that was used on them.<br>
<p>
All three of these groups can be distinguished in conversation because<br>
they will often agree in words to the point being discussed but yet<br>
the extraneous things they add to the conversation will tell you that <br>
there is another issue which is emotionally much more important to them.<br>

I genuinely doubt that SDA churches attract a disproportionate share of<br>
odd people.  I suspect one would find that other churches have their<br>
share as well.  As an extreme, perhaps, consider the "holiness" churches<br>
that handle rattlesnakes.  Consider the churches that pray for the death<br>
of certain Supreme Court justices whom they dislike.  Consider the churches<br>
that take racist or violent positions.  Etc, etc.<br>

<i>&gt; [.. lots of things ..]</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Now for the troubling text:  "If you keep... from doing as you please</i><br>
<i>&gt; on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight... if you honor it by </i><br>
<i>&gt; not going your own way, doing as you please, or speaking idle words, </i><br>
<i>&gt; then you will find your joy in the Lord..."  Isa 58:13-14</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    How can I keep from doing as I please, yet be expected to call the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sabbath a delight?  Does this text mean I can't do anything fun on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sabbath?  What exactly constitutes "doing as one pleases?"</i><br>
<p>
I shan't address everything in John's message, raising some excellent<br>
points for tho't, but I did want to respond to the above since I've been<br>
thinking on this lately.<br>
<p>
Recently, a certain pastor discussed the above text, and made some<br>
observations and conclusions.  I found myself in disagreement with<br>
his observations, making his conclusions worthy of question.  His observation<br>
had to do with the word "pleasure".  He claimed that in olden times,<br>
when you entered a pub, the waiter asked you, "What is your pleasure?"<br>
You would answer "plumber" or "accountant" (to use today's terms) and be<br>
shown to a table of your fellows.  He observed then, that the verse<br>
meant simply you should not work for gain on the Sabbath.  Altho I had never<br>
encountered this alleged denotation in old English (e.g., Shakespeare), I<br>
could not deny it.  Hence it seemed worthwhile investigating the underlying<br>
Hebrew to see if it supported this concept.<br>
<p>
The Strong's number for "pleasure" herein, if memory serves, is 2656;<br>
the Hebrew is "chephets" (khay-phets), meaning delight, pleasure, that<br>
which delights or pleases you, etc.  Hence, the Hebrew does not support<br>
the notion that "pleasure" here means "work".<br>
<p>
Moreover, in the classic Hebrew manner of expressing parallel tho'ts,<br>
the phrase is in context with:<br>
    not doing thine own ways,<br>
    nor finding thine own pleasure,<br>
    nor speaking thine own words: (Is 58:13c)<br>
<p>
I submit that this is contrasting honoring God by doing what pleases Him<br>
versus pleasing ourselves, i.e., doing whatever we please, doing whatever<br>
we want (the essence of rebellion and selfishness).  I believe that the<br>
prior phrases support this.  Notice:<br>
    and call the sabbath a delight,<br>
    the holy of the LORD, honourable;<br>
    and shalt honour him, (Is 58:13b)<br>
<p>
When we understand the contrast, that helps us understand what John finds<br>
troubling:<br>
    If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath,<br>
    from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; (Is 58:13a)<br>
<p>
The contrast of "pleasing God" versus "pleasing myself" is repeated numerous<br>
times in Scripture.  Deut 12:8, 13:18: Judges 17:6, 21:25; and throughout<br>
Kings and Chronicles as a description of a king's reign, e.g., 2 Chr 14:2.<br>
Also note Proverbs:<br>
    PRO 12:15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that<br>
    hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.<br>
    PRO 21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD<br>
    pondereth the hearts.<br>
<p>
But, one may say, it still sounds like I can't have fun on the Sabbath!<br>
Well, perhaps it depends upon how we have developed our tastes.  Let's<br>
note some more contrasts simply where the word pleasure is used, let<br>
alone joy (Neh 8:10) and many others we could also refer to:<br>
    PSA 16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is<br>
    fulness of JOY; at thy right hand there are PLEASURES for evermore.<br>
    PSA 36:8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;<br>
    and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy PLEASURES.<br>
    PSA 111:2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that<br>
    have pleasure therein.<br>
    PHI 2:13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of<br>
    his good pleasure.<br>
<p>
    PRO 21:17 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that<br>
    loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.<br>
    ECC 2:1 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,<br>
    therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.<br>
    ISA 47:8 Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that<br>
    dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else<br>
    beside me;<br>
    LUK 8:14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they<br>
    have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures<br>
    of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.<br>
    ROM 1:32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such<br>
    things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in<br>
    them that do them.<br>
    TH2 2:12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but<br>
    had pleasure in unrighteousness.<br>
    PE2 2:13 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that<br>
    count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes,<br>
    sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;<br>
    HEB 11:25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,<br>
    than to enjoy the PLEASURES OF SIN for a season;<br>
<p>
We see clearly contrasted the pleasures of God versus the pleasures of sin.<br>
These are parallel with, may I suggest identical to, the contrasts preceding.<br>
<p>
When we are willing to accept God's premise that the Sabbath is a delight<br>
made for us (Mar 2:27), to be found when we desire His pleasures instead<br>
of our own carnal ones, when we desire His ways above ours (Isa ch 55),<br>
when we desire to speak His words (Isa 6:1-8), then we shall experience<br>
the promised rewards:<br>
    ISA 58:14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause<br>
    thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the<br>
    heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.<br>

I like Harvey Brenneise's idea of using SDA-L as some kind of forum for<br>
discussion of items of interest to SDA higher education, or SDA's and<br>
higher education. We do miss the association amongst colleagues a lot. I<br>
think that the stated reason of reduced finances is purely a screen.<br>
Administrators still meet together.<br>
<p>
They may indeed be afraid that if faculty meet together on a broad basis<br>
they may start demanding some reasonable things like reversing the<br>
continued erosion of faculty salaries against inflation.<br>
<p>
Everybody probably knows, but if you haven't had your ear to the<br>
grapevine, The board of trustees of La Sierra University has invited Larry<br>
Geraty to leave AUC and come to LSU as president. Tom Mostert, board chairman,<br>
announced this at the faculty-board dinner after board meeting Monday<br>
night. Interstingly, in his announcement, Mostert never once mentioned<br>
Geraty's name! The debate is whether this was merely an oversight on<br>
Mostert's part, or a shrewd political maneuver to cover his tail if Geraty<br>
doesn't ever get here.<br>

Quite some months back, I posed a question to the net regarding how<br>
one might obtain materials produced by the late James Arrabito and<br>
his (now widowed) wife (sorry, I don't know here name).  I didn't<br>
get any responses, altho I noticed a passing reference by Dave Buxton<br>
in my collection of SDAnet postings.<br>
<p>
FYI, I tracked down the info, thanks to Steve Caza at Weimar:<br>
    LLT Productions<br>
    P.O. Box 205<br>
    Angwin, CA  94508<br>
    phone: 707-965-2786<br>
<p>
When I called this morning, the person answering mentioned several things<br>
of interest from which I can just recall two video titles:<br>
    A Young Person's History of the Sabbath<br>
    Israel of the Alps<br>
<p>
My eldest has seen the first and highly recommends it.  The second is about<br>
the Waldenses, a subject of great interest to my wife, Kathie.  Since<br>
SDAnetters might also find these subjects of interest for themselves or<br>
their church's video lending library, I reckoned I should share it.<br>

seem to have some difficulty deciding which bits we will allow<br>
ourselves to disagree on.  Ironically, many of these things are, in<br>
fact, things that people disagree about.  Many of the "hot potatoes"<br>
are more or less accepted in some parts of the world: e.g. the<br>
ordination of women, or worship styles.  In the list of Sabbath<br>
afternoon activities given in another posting, many would be acceptable<br>
in some cultures but not in others.<br>
<p>
This must mean we either _are_ able to cope with cultural variations,<br>

Hello SDAnetters,<br>
<p>
	one of my classmates has been using irc to get into internet<br>
discussion groups, and he met this homosexual pastor from the USA who<br>
convinced him that the bible is not against homosexuality at all, and that<br>
people who say it does are interpreting it from a homophobic viewpoint. He<br>
is so convinced by this gay pastor that he has an almost missionary zeal to<br>
bring the other christians in my class around to his view.<br>
	I shall not go into the details of his arguments for biblical<br>
non-condemnation of homosexuality, no true SDA would ever be taken in by<br>
them. However, he brought up the point that the bible doesn't even mention<br>
anything about female homosexuality at all, and so it is at least ok to be<br>
lesbian. Well, i'v looked but i can't find anything in the bible that<br>
specifically makes any reference to female homosexuality. I'd be grateful if<br>
anyone can tell me if any such bible texts do exist, in case i missed it or<br>
something, so that if they do exist, i can show them to him.<br>
	Frankly, i cannot understand how anybody can come to the conclusion<br>
that the bible supports homosexuality, or how a homosexual can be a pastor.<br>
By the way, I recently herd from this advocate of erroneous doctrine, that<br>
Hawii may soon recognise homosexual marriages! That just blows my mind. I<br>
mean, isn't it illegal or something? Well i don't know about Hawii, but in<br>
my country it is illegal to have sex with children or with members of the<br>
same sex, and such practices are generally regarded with disgust and<br>
abhorrence, even by the majority non-christian population.<br>

I'm glad that e-mail address lists are not released to non-subscribers<br>
of SDAnet, but I'd also like to suggest that e-mail mailing lists not be<br>
released to ANYONE without each individual's express permission.  I feel<br>
that just because I belong to a mailing list (e-mail, Snail mail, or<br>
otherwise) does not mean that my address should be distributed to<br>
others.  I feel that people should have the right to choose who gets<br>
information about them.<br>
<p>
I know that some will say that this is "public" information - that it<br>
could be gotten simply from passwd files on computer systems, etc.  But<br>
The analogy is sometimes made to "public" listings of names and<br>
addresses in phone books.....  But my argument is that just because<br>
something has been "public" information - like phone books - does not<br>
mean that it is the same issue when it is in machine readable form, a<br>
form that makes it very easily distributable and searchable by all kinds<br>
of people.  I think that this issue needs to be addressed by the<br>
computing/information community and given very serious thought.  I think<br>
it is being badly neglected in the discussions of today.<br>

Differences between the Davidians?<br>
<p>
Well, my mother went to school with Desmond Doss and so I grew up on<br>
Desmond Doss stories.  Desmond Doss served as a medic in WW-II, keeping<br>
the Sabbath and refusing to carry a weapon.  On training maneuvers<br>
on Sabbath he stayed at the base reading his Bible.  Because of his<br>
honest sincere hardworking courage he soon was accepted by the troops<br>
after a few weeks of harrasment.  The high point of the book comes<br>
when his unit takes on the Japanese in one of the bloodiest battles,<br>
on the Sabbath.  This was not war games, medics were going to be<br>
desperately needed and so Desmond Doss moved out with his unit with<br>
his medical kit.  The troops climbed a cliff and started forward<br>
and were soon mowed down by gun fire.  Those who had not made it over<br>
the top refused to go forward to retrieve the wounded.  Desmond Doss<br>
climbed that cliff with ropes and medical gear.  He dragged his buddies<br>
back to the top of the cliff and then had to stand up, exposed to<br>
gun fire, to lower each man by rope to his buddies down below.  The<br>
bullets whistled past his ears but not one his him.  He was later<br>
awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by the president of the USA<br>
on the White House lawn.<br>
<p>
In all the Apocaliptic scenarios I've read about SDAs in a last<br>
days context, I don't see any of them picking up anything to defend<br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
SDAs -- non compatent medics in time of war.<br>
[I think that ^^^^ means _combatant_.  SCT]<br>
<p>
Branch Davidians -- amasing an arsinal of war.<br>

Time was when a divorce meant a death sentence for a pastor's career in <br>
the SDA church.  It seems that this is no longer the case.  Is this <br>
another case of trying so hard to avoid the past mistake of condemnation<br>
that we have fallen into the opposite trap of being morally struck mute?<br>
Or worse yet, have we moved from condemners to enablers, becoming void<br>
of spiritual authority?<br>
<p>
I am not saying that a divorce ought necessarily to end a pastor's career.<br>
Nor do I know any divorced pastors still serving who are guilty of adultery.<br>
But the state of families in church leadership as well as membership is <br>
certainly endangered today, and I would like to see a way for the church <br>
to support family unity.  Any ideas?<br>

We've had a few posts on the issue that seemed to disappear into the <br>
bit bucket and gather no responses.  <br>
<p>
The central question here is:  "Is whatever that is not expressly forbidden<br>
by the Bible allowed?"  <br>
<p>
There are two slippery slopes of Bible interpretation that one can fall <br>
down in this instance, and I find myself arguing for balance, which worries me.<br>
<p>
Slippery slope number 1:  We argue that some of the verses in the NT are<br>
culturally conditioned.  (Particularly those dealing with women.)  But the<br>
verses dealing with women and those dealing with homosexuality are in close<br>
juxtaposition, and it is hard to reject one set without rejecting the <br>
other as well.<br>
<p>
Slippery slope number 2:  We hold the Mosaic laws against homosexuality<br>
and bestiality to be still binding.  But then it is difficult to say why <br>
the others should not be valid still as well.  Furthermore, if we wish <br>
to establish God's ideal for sexual intimacy, we must return to the <br>
Genesis account of the creation of Adam and Eve.  If initimacy is viewed<br>
as the ultimate expression of the image of God, then not only homosexuality<br>
but perhaps other sexual variants even between marriage partners, and birth <br>
control, can be called into question.  In short, I fail to see how one <br>
can pursue this line of thought and not wind up with the Catholic view<br>
of procreation.  People have tried to convince me otherwise on SDAnet<br>
and hopefully they will try again.  But I find it strange that most groups<br>
who deliver Bible studies on this issue come up with a position that <br>
declares to be "all right" what they are already doing.<br>

The classic text is Romans 1:26-7 which reads as follows in the NIV:<br>
<p>
"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.  Even their women<br>
exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.  In the same way the men<br>
also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust<br>
for one another.  Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received<br>
in themselves the due penalty for their perversion."<br>
<p>
As for the legality of homosexual marriages, I am not familiar with the<br>
situation in Hawaii, but in California, not only have homosexual marriages<br>
been legal for some time, they are currently more "politically correct"<br>
than heterosexual marriages.  To me, this is simply one more sign of the<br>
times.<br>

   I think one of the biggest differences is that Seventh Day Adventists<br>
   don't own so many guns.  : )<br>

Interestingly, according to one source, the issue that lead to the<br>
final break between branch members and the official SDA church was<br>
pacifism -- early in WW II, they objected to the SDA position of<br>
conscientious "cooperation" or non-combatency, preferring a completely<br>
pacifist position.  If this is true, the evolution to one of armed<br>
resistence is particularly ironic.<br>

To answer the original poster's question: the apostle Paul<br>
mentions what can be reasonably interpreted as female homosexuality<br>
in Romans 1:26, lumping it together with its male analogue in<br>
the next verse.<br>
<p>
Regarding slippery slope #1: I've also wondered if the NT condemnation<br>
of homosexuality could possibly be culturally conditioned, as some of<br>
the verses dealing with women are thought to be (though perhaps<br>
properly understood the latter are not as controversial as they appear<br>
taken at face value).  What helped convince me that this is probably<br>
*not* the case are the corresponding Mosiac prohibitions against<br>
homosexuality.  The culture of the early Christians in Rome was<br>
substantially different than that of the Israelites in the wilderness.<br>
Yet homosexual relations are a sin in both cultures.  To me this is a<br>
sign of something normative.<br>

<i>&gt; the others should not be valid still as well.  Furthermore, if we wish </i><br>
<p>
If by "others" you mean other parts of the Levitical code, there are<br>
indeed other parts which are still binding on Christians (e.g. the<br>
definitions of unclean meats which are not to be considered as food).<br>
For myself, it helps to (1) try to understand the principle behind<br>
the original regulation (2) decide if the principle is still valid<br>
and (3) if the principle is still valid, decide if the regulation is<br>
still a valid application of that principle.<br>
<p>
For passover and the sacrificial system, I don't think the principle of<br>
pointing forward to Christ is valid anymore.  They've been superseded.<br>
(e.g., by the Lord's Supper, which shows the Lord's death until He<br>
returns). <br>
<p>
For unclean meats, the NT principle of my body as the temple of God<br>
is still valid today.  Given that the composition of unclean meats<br>
and the human body's reaction to consuming them is not any better today<br>
than in OT times, it seems logical that (3) holds and the regulation is<br>
still applicable. <br>

I find it interesting to read the whole of Isaiah 58 rather than<br>
just the last two or three texts. If you consider the days of <br>
fasting as similar to the Sabbath, then this may provide more<br>
illumination on the topic of doing good on the Sabbath. Whether<br>
or not this is good exegesis is another question!<br>
<p>
As for "refraining from doing as you please", I don't think<br>
anybody reads that as "don't do anything you enjoy", rather "don't<br>
just do any old thing". Treat the day as distinctly separate from<br>
your everyday existence.<br>
<p>
And the phrase "do no work"? I would like to hear from one of our<br>
ancient languages experts as to just what this phrase could mean.<br>
I doubt that the "work" referred to hear is the same definition of<br>
work that a ten year old would use, or even that a modern Western<br>
adult would use.<br>
<p>
It's also interesting to carefully look at Jesus' Sabbath miracles.<br>
In each and every case the healing was a non-urgent, non-life-<br>
threatening situation; well, those that are recorded in the gospels<br>
anyway. Each time He made a point of it, rather than just healing<br>
the person quietly. I have often wondered what Jesus would do in<br>
the late twentieth century to shock Seventh-day Adventists into<br>
viewing the Sabbath differently!<br>
<p>
Lastly...<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
   I believe that the Bible should be our main source of truth.  This isn't<br>
to say that the writings of Ellen White and other books are irrelevent.  On<br>
the contrary!  I often gain many spiritual blessings from the writings of EGW, <br>
and believe that her writings are very relevent and appropriate today.  I just<br>
believe that when it comes to defining beliefs, then we should base our <br>
decisions fully on God's word.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
To the writer of this paragraph, what major difference do you perceive between<br>
the word of God given through Ellen White and that given through the prophets<br>
of old? Given, of course, that every prophet was a "modern day" prophet at<br>
some point in history.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; anything about female homosexuality at all, and so it is at least ok to be</i><br>

<p>
Definitely Rom 1:26,27; possibly 2 Tim 3:2,3 or Jude 10 and thereabouts.<br>
<p>
Regarding heterosexual relationships, as Steve T, brought up, the KJV reads:<br>
    HEB 13:4 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but<br>
    whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.<br>
Some have concluded that Paul is saying "anything goes, if you're married",<br>
thereby justifying oral, anal, a bit of bondage or porn, S&amp;M, etc (gross!).<br>
<p>
I have read that the KJV rendering is unfortunate, that the underlying<br>
Greek is more like an injunction, "Keep your marriage bed undefiled!"<br>
(Perhaps those who actually know Greek can help out.  I don't have other<br>
translations at hand, so I'll have to check how they read.)  In my reading<br>
of EGW, I have come across counsel that certain behaviors *do* defile the<br>
marriage bed.<br>
<p>
Regarding Lordship and God's purposes, if you enjoy studying Scripture<br>
to see how it matches with what you've heretofore believe, I recommend<br>
a book from Wolgemuth &amp; Hyatt publishers, by Rick &amp; Jan Hess, entitled<br>
"A Full Quiver".  If you think you know what Ps 127:3-5 means, this will<br>
challenge you.  It sure did us.<br>

<p>
I believe that a true SDA can surely believe in non-condemnation of<br>
homosexuality.  I am one of them.  <br>
<p>
You probably won't find anything about lesbians in the scriptures.  At least<br>
I haven't found anything but then that is hardly a surprise.  In the scriptures<br>
women are talked about only as a function of males.  <br>
<p>
Beng wrties:  "it is illegal to have sex with children or with members of the<br>
same sex".  <br>
<p>
To equate sexual abuse of children with sexual acts between consenting<br>
adults is to minimize a horrible act of domination.  <br>
<p>
We, none of us, know why a person is a gay, lesbian or a straight person.  We<br>
can, however, observe how difficult it is in our society for a person who is gay or lesbian.  We, as friends of the Divine One, could perhaps ease this pain by<br>
providing acceptance and love.  We have been told not to judge--when we<br>
condemn persons different from us we are judging.<br>
<p>
You might talk with a person who is struggling with who they are (e.g. with their sexual orientation) before you make blanket statements of condemnation.  <br>
I cannot believe that we are acting as co-workers with the Holy One when we<br>
alienate persons who are different from us.<br>

I'm no Bible scholar, but the silence on female homosexuality<br>
or lesbianism seems to be in keeping with the general<br>
male-centered Bible accounts... Its just business as usual. : )<br>

It seems to me that most groups who deliver Bible studies on *any* issue<br>
come up with a position that declares to be "all right" what they are<br>
already doing. Bible study in the modern era often seems to be a process<br>
of strengthening ones faith in ones beliefs.<br>

The following was printed last week in the Dallas Morning News. I have<br>
a copy from a reliable source, but still need to verify that it was<br>
actually printed myself. The nature of the add and newsprint graphic<br>
of 2 young children makes it obvious though.<br>
<p>
Must of had some effect. Yesterday the "now-always-suspect-news-media"<br>
broadcast that Doyle had been sent to McLennan County Jail to be im-<br>
prisoned as a material witness (hope he healed in a week), and Ferguson<br>
sent to one of the military "burn" hospitals.<br>

<p>
                  One man in one tank to save 90 lives<br>
<p>
<p>
        If your Commander would have sent one man driving one tank,<br>
      and if that one man would have slowly and carefully caved in<br>
      the walls of Mount Carmel Church, levelling it to the ground,<br>
      all of the women, children, babies and 80 year elderly would<br>
      have vacated that  church without  a shot being fired and 90<br>
      lives would have been saved.<br>
<p>
        HUMANITARIAN REQUEST.  You have a prisoner  by the name of<br>
      Clive Doyle who you are keeping  in iron chains  at Parkland<br>
      Hospital.  He sustained  third degree burns  during the Waco<br>
      holocaust,  is now undergoing  skin grafts  from his feet to<br>
      groin,  and your chains  are causing intense pain.  Also you<br>
      have Misty Ferguson,  a girl of 16 who may have he hands am-<br>
      putated  due to infection  from burns sustained  during your<br>
      paramilitary operation.  Also  we Adventists  have  for  150<br>
      years known  the secret of miraculous treatment of burns us-<br>
      ing  a damp  charcoal poultice.  Therefore,  we request your<br>
      compassion for the removal of the chains rubbing burnt skin,<br>
      and that Adventist doctors be allowed to administer charcoal<br>
      poultices.<br>
<p>
        We know  nothing  about  the religion  or politics  of the<br>
      Branch Davidian Adventist  men except they claim to be Adven-<br>
      tist  and that places  the burden of supporting their widows<br>
      and ophans square on our shoulders.<br>

This message appeared on talk.religion.misc on the Usenet.  John Ellis<br>
and his crew are bad news and this could be a PR disaster.  We need to find<br>
out who John Ellis is and get the word out PRONTO.  I will be traveling<br>
all day today, if someone could send out to SDA-L so it gets out fast<br>
I'd appreciate it much.   Steve Timm<br>

Re Sabbath.<br>
<p>
The there is the question about sabbath hours. I am talking about the date line. Youi can keep<br>
You can keepo the sabbath on a sunday or even on a friday depending on which <br>
side you stay of a (man made) line somewhere in the Pacific. Then there is the<br>
question about places on the other side of the polarcircles, where you could have the <br>
have the sabbath the whole summer or winter, but ehre some commitee has decided to keep it from sdix t<br>
to keep it from six to six.<br>

<i>&gt;We, none of us, know why a person is a gay, lesbian or a straight person. </i><br>
<i>&gt;We can, however, observe how difficult it is in our society for a person</i><br>

<p>
It is true that homosexuals have a hard time in society, and that we should<br>
definitely provide everyone, including them, with acceptance and love, but<br>
that does not mean that we okay homosexuality any more than we do any other<br>
form of sex perversion (eg: heterosexual adultery etc).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You might talk with a person who is struggling with who they are (e.g.</i><br>
<i>&gt;with their sexual orientation) before you make blanket statements of</i><br>
<i>&gt;condemnation.  I cannot believe that we are acting as co-workers with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Holy One when we alienate persons who are different from us.</i><br>
<p>
Well, are not all Christians struggling with self? It is not our business to<br>
condemn individuals, but we are to call sin by its right name. "Straight"<br>
people perhaps have to struggle with various other temptations too, and we<br>
don't condemn them as people, neither do we tell them it is okay to sin, we<br>
should treat homosexuals the same. What i am really against is the promotion<br>
of sin as a way of life, which is what some of these gay and lesbian<br>
activists seem to be doing.<br>

1. If you have access to a copy of the White Lie, read it -- it is a<br>
fascinating volume and well-documented.  I could only wish that Wlater<br>
(oops, Walter) Rey (or is it Ray?) had been less vitriolic and more<br>
even-tempered in between his scholarly documentations of EGW's borrowing<br>
of material.  He has side by side comparisons of chspaters in which<br>
nearly every word, plus chapter titles and illustrations have been<br>
taken from another book.  (Well, I can't type today -- chspaters=chapters!)<br>
<p>
2. Our PUC netter may have more up to date information, but I hear that<br>
the PUC golf course idea is not dead yet.  My brother sent me clippings<br>
from the St. Helena paper that include a discussion of various uses for<br>
some of the college's land: cemetery, retirement center, agricultural uses;<br>
however, the VP for financial affairs at PUC is quoted as saying that<br>
the administration thought those uses would not generate as much income<br>
as a golf course!  Well, now, if income is our goal, turn the college into<br>
a casino!  That would really bring in the bucks!<br>
<p>
3. Along the same lines, the Newbury Park church has decided to move<br>
their church, school, and senior citizens' housing to one end of their<br>
campus, and build a 30-acre shopping mall at the other end -- complete<br>
with a multiscreen theater, Price Club type warehouse, and other stores<br>
that would sell liquor and remain open through the weekend.  Adventist<br>
officials "in charge of the project angrily refute accusations that they<br>
are abandoning their religious principles for material gain.  Although they<br>
will shepherd the project through the Planning Commission and City Council<br>
over the next six months, the Adventists plan to sell the movie theater<br>
and perhaps the retail stores once the development gets under way, church<br>
leaders said."  Oh, well, that makes me feel better!  We are just getting<br>
it started, then selling, so we have no further responsibility!  Whatever<br>
happened to the "strangers within our gates" admonition?<br>
<p>
Regarding numbers 2 and 3, I think we would do well to read a little<br>
Faust now and again, just to remind us what happens to someone who sells<br>
their soul for earthly gain.  I mention Faust, because surely these good<br>
SDA people are not reading their Bibles and following the council they<br>
find there....<br>

In the discussion on female homosexuality it was brought up that it is<br>
difficult to know which OT laws one can appeal to.  On this note, I would<br>
like to point out that with the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 we know that<br>
for Gentiles (aand Jews) Leviticus 1@7-18 jis in some sense still valid. <br>
Also, it is interesting to note the allusion to the food laws when ch. 17<br>
verse 13 says . . . "And anyone of the people of Israel, or of the aliens<br>
who reside among them, who hunts down an animal or bird that *may be<br>
eaten* shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth." Ian. <br>

As for the legality of homosexual marriages, I am not familiar with the<br>
situation in Hawaii, but in California, not only have homosexual marriages<br>
been legal for some time, they are currently more "politically correct"<br>
than heterosexual marriages.  To me, this is simply one more sign of the<br>
times.<br>
------------------------------------------<br>
This must surely be a joke.... I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT THIS<br>
IS *NOT* THE CASE.  PLEASE GIVE REFERENCES TO THIS.<br>
WHEN DID THIS PRACTICE OF CALIFORNIA SAME SEX<br>
MARRIAGES BEGIN?  Remember that to the rulers and teachers of<br>
the law in Jesus' day, His association with "sinners"/"tax collectors"<br>
and claiming to be in the will of God, spelled B-e-l-z-e-b-u-b (not just<br>
one more sign of the times).<br>
<p>
The questions should be, not "Is homosexuality condemned in the<br>
word of God."  But, "How do I allow Christ to live out His principles and<br>
character in me towards homosexuals or any other 'condemned'?"<br>
Is it through oppression, prejudice, bigotry, self-righteousness?<br>
Or furthermore, "%WILL% I allow Christ to do it?"<br>

The questions raised by John Ash about Sabbath observance are interesting<br>
and provide the basis for a very long discussion. The verses from the<br>
Bible regarding the detail of Sabbath observance range from condemnation<br>
of any work through to allowing necessary work.<br>
<p>
On the one hand we are told not to do our own pleasure, while on the other<br>
hand we are told that the Sabbath was made for man. We live in a complex<br>
society and it is impossible to shut down hospitals, power stations,<br>
blast furnaces etc for a variety of reasons. How then do we observe<br>
Sabbath?<br>
<p>
1.  Sabbath is a state of mind. We should do all in our power to make<br>
    the Sabbath a delight in the culture and environment we find ourselves<br>
    in.<br>
<p>
2.  The Sabbath was designed as a day of rest. It should be a change<br>
    from what we do for the rest of the week.<br>
<p>
3.  The Jews were condemned for the minute detail of law with which they<br>
    surrounded the Sabbath. They were not condemned for their celebration<br>
    of the Sabbath. It is celebrated as something special, like a birthday<br>
    party.<br>
<p>
4.  We are often too quick to condemn what we see as poor Sabbath observance<br>
    when really many of the differences are cultural. eg Australians don't<br>
    play sport on Sabbath (usually), Other cultures do. I don't think<br>
    either position is wrong.<br>
<p>
5.  The Bible is not a rule book for everything we do. It lays down some<br>
    good principles which we can apply. It says nothing about TV, cars<br>
    and computers, but that does not mean that we should not use them.<br>
    Similarly it only lays down some principles about Sabbath keeping.<br>
    It omits the detail and leaves us to decide that for ourselves.<br>
<p>
6.  An exact formula would be nice, but a heuristic allows us to express<br>
    our Sabbath observance in creative and inovative ways. God himself<br>
    is a creator and I think sometimes he expects us, his subjects to<br>
    be creative as well.<br>

A few year ago Humberto Rasi and George Akers from the GC came to<br>
Avondale to run a seminar on Integrated Faith and Learning (IFL).<br>
We had an intersting time and a number of points were raised which<br>
Hilighted the difference between American and Australian education<br>
systems.<br>
<p>
It was pointed out that integrating faith and learning was much easier<br>
in subjects such as literature, history and science, and much more<br>
difficult in subjects such as maths and computer science. It appeared<br>
that the more vocational a subject was, the less easy it was to include<br>
our faith in our teaching.<br>
<p>
As a computer science lecturer, I adopted the approach that in these<br>
subjects the content was less important and the pedagogy, the methods<br>
of how you taught the subject were more important when it comes to<br>
integrating Christian values.<br>
<p>
Since the SDAnet has a number of both educators and students of<br>
computer science among its members, I would be interested in hearing some<br>
dialog on IFL in the area of computer science. At the time of the workshop<br>
I wrote a paper about IFL in computer science and I would like to<br>
improve the paper now by hearing what others have to say about the subject.<br>

When discussing the existence of homo-sexuality (male and female) in relation<br>
to biblical teaching, I have often wondered if it would not be wise to <br>
"back up" one step:<br>
<p>
Would someone with these type of "propensities" be willing to make a<br>
"till-death-do-us-part" commitment with one and only one partner?  If not,<br>
wouldn't it be unacceptable on these biblical grounds?<br>
<p>
Phrased differently, when Christ said a look accompanied by desire for any-<br>
one other than one's wife constituted adultery, wouldn't a desiring look<br>
at someone of the same sex (if the person has such desires), also be<br>
breaking of the 7th commandment.  Christ's words obviously apply to ladies<br>
desires towards men as well and hence I would see in Matthew 5 a biblical<br>
basis for rejecting 99% of typical homo-sexual practices.<br>

In my most recent re-reading of the Desire of Ages (today) I found a<br>
thought which I'd not dwelt on before.  Sister White describes in<br>
chapter 14 (We have found the Messias) the scene with Jesus<br>
meeting John the Baptist in the wilderness as he preaches and the<br>
beginning of Jesus' gathering of his disciples.  She writes:<br>
-------------- 0 --------------<br>
"If Nathanael had trusted in the rabbis for guidance, he would never<br>
have found Jesus.  It was by seeing and judging for himself that he<br>
became a disciple.  So in the case of many today whom prejudice<br>
witholds from good.  How different would be the result, if they would<br>
'come and see.'  While they trust in the guidance of human authority,<br>
none will come to a saving knowledge of the truth.  ....Philip said to<br>
Nathanael, 'Come and see.'  He did not ask him to accept another's<br>
testimony, but to behold Christ for himself.  Now that Jesus has<br>
ascended to heaven, His disciples are His representatives among<br>
men, and one of the most effective ways of winning souls to Him is in<br>
exemplifying His character in our daily life.  Our influence upon others<br>
depends not so much upon what we say, as upon what we are.<br>
Men may combat and defy our logic, they may resist our appeals;<br>
but a life of disinterested love is an argument they cannot gainsay.<br>
A consistent life, characterized by the meekness of Christ, is a power<br>
in the world."<br>
-------------- 0 --------------<br>
This is pretty encouraging to me!  For millennia, the people of God had<br>
to approach through sacrifice, and earthly priest, now the only door<br>
to God is Jesus Christ the righteous.  And more, we are welcomed to<br>
"come and see"  ***for ourselves***.  We are free to approach God in<br>
Christ just as we are (don't have to pretend to be something/someone<br>
you aren't)!  We can be honest and open with our savior!  Isn't this GOOD<br>
NEWS?<br>

Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,<br>
<p>
	one of our people, namely my friend Caleb Khor Ken Swee, who is an<br>
AY leader in my church, has need of your prayers.  He is a first year<br>
engineering student at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) here in<br>
Singapore.  He just got his examination time table, and his computing paper<br>
is scheduled to be sat for at 9am on Saturday 5th June.  This is quite a<br>
trying situation for him as his career is at stake here.  He is trying to<br>
contact the registrar's office to see if anything can be done to arrange for<br>
him to sit for the paper on another day, i have not had news yet of what has<br>
come of that.<br>
	As you probably know, Sabbath problems are no fun at all, so please<br>
pray the Lord to give him faith and guidance. If you want to give him some<br>
encouraging words, send them to him at this address:<br>
<p>
	be7116503@ntuvax.ntu.ac.sg<br>
<p>
OR<br>
<p>
	be7116503@v9000.ntu.ac.sg<br>
<p>
regards,<br>
	Beng Tang<br>

<i>&gt; 3. Along the same lines, the Newbury Park church has decided to move</i><br>
<i>&gt; their church, school, and senior citizens' housing to one end of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; campus, and build a 30-acre shopping mall at the other end -- complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a multiscreen theater, Price Club type warehouse, and other stores</i><br>
<i>&gt; that would sell liquor and remain open through the weekend.  </i><br>
<p>
This is obviously not the same bunch of administrators that ran<br>
the Newbury Park that I remember.<br>
<p>
Maybe I'm just become irrelevant.<br>
<p>
Maybe the students of the academy these days wouldn't get the<br>
wrong impression that I would have taken from such a project<br>
had it been contemplated when I was there.<br>
<p>
Feh.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Although they</i><br>
<i>&gt; will shepherd the project through the Planning Commission and City Council</i><br>
<i>&gt; over the next six months, the Adventists plan to sell the movie theater</i><br>
<i>&gt; and perhaps the retail stores once the development gets under way, church</i><br>
<i>&gt; leaders said</i><br>
<p>
That should fix just about everything...  :{<br>

This is really SAD!  I'd rather they sell the whole thing and get it over<br>
with than "assist" with its establishment.  But then it might be viewed<br>
as a "wash our hands of our dirty-work" sort-a-thing.  Maybe getting<br>
back to the basic principles of stewardship would help.<br>
<p>
Of course with the cost of land in growing metro areas these days,<br>
its hard to draw the line between worshiping mammon, and owning<br>
cheaper pastures.  Forest Lake Academy in Orlando sold some of<br>
their property to "secular" development a few years ago.  However,<br>
I think it was for a housing development.  Re: Newbury Pk. gotta know<br>
the whole story w/motives.... anybody with greater detail about this?<br>

Thanks for sharing this. I totally agree with you and appreciate you <br>
speaking out against the norm.<br>

<i>|</i><br>
<i>|I believe that a true SDA can surely believe in non-condemnation of</i><br>

<i>|</i><br>
<i>|You probably won't find anything about lesbians in the scriptures.  At least</i><br>

<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Beng wrties:  "it is illegal to have sex with children or with members of the</i><br>

<i>|</i><br>
<i>|To equate sexual abuse of children with sexual acts between consenting</i><br>
<i>|adults is to minimize a horrible act of domination.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|We, none of us, know why a person is a gay, lesbian or a straight person.  We</i><br>

<i>|</i><br>
<i>|You might talk with a person who is struggling with who they</i><br>

I can't help it.  Yes I can, but I won't.  I'll try to stop after this one.<br>
<p>
I was reading again in the desire of ages under "The Call by the Sea"<br>
and the following paragraph really spoke to me, maybe it will touch you too.<br>
[Inclusions added]<br>
==============================================================<br>
"He [or she] who loves Christ the most, will do the greatest amount of good.<br>
There is no limit to the usefulness of one who, by putting self aside, makes<br>
room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his [her] heart, and lives a life<br>
wholly consecrated to God.  If [wo]men will endure the necessary discipline,<br>
without complaining, or fainting by the way, God will teach them hour by hour,<br>
day by day.  He longs to reveal His grace.  If His people will remove the<br>
obstructions, He will pour forth the waters of salvation in abundant streams<br>
through the human channels.  If [wo]men in humble life were encouraged to<br>
do all the good they could do, **if restraining hands were not laid upon them<br>
to repress their zeal, there would be a hundred workers for Christ where now<br>
there is one.**<br>
================================================================<br>
This might sound like an anti-governing/regulation/accountability quote to<br>
some people.  And in a sense it is.  But not completely, since more of the<br>
governing is done by God and less by humans.  It doesn't support laziness,<br>
or "freeloading" in our walk, but also invites us to put more trust in the<br>
competence of Christ.  It would be interesting to know about the obstructions,<br>
probably those which have been in the way before, I guess.<br>

I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone eho isn't an SDA.  It basically <br>
makes E.G. White into a plagarist.  Maybe by today's legal standards, she <br>
could be charged with plagarism, but back in the 19th century, you didn't <br>
have to document your sources as thoughly as you do now.<br>
If Sister White had broken any plagarism laws, she would've been brought <br>
to trial, I'm sure.  Since she wasn't sued or ever accused of plagarism <br>
by her detractors in her day, I'd have to say that Walter Rea was out to <br>
smear Sister White, not to encourage the remnant church in the faith of <br>
Jesus.<br>

As I've shared before, my approach to this topic changed <br>
somewhat when a friend confided to me that she was <br>
a lesbian.  A lot of theories blow up in  ones face when <br>
faced with the task of practicality.<br>
<p>
Though I do not embrace or condone her behavior, neither <br>
do I condemn it, nor am I surprised by it.  Whatever ones<br>
opinion or belief may be concerning this, responses to it <br>
must come from reasoned calmness and a implicit assumption<br>
that the person is acting as he/she feels he/she must do.<br>
Responses based from fear are counterproductive.<br>
<p>
I feel the battle is too narrowly defined.  Many of the<br>
so-called "pro-family" forces are focusing all their energies<br>
on claiming the homosexual orientation is a choice and not<br>
an innate part of the person.  I would counter that there<br>
is just as much a genetic link to alcoholism as there is to <br>
homosexuality, perhaps more.  Genetic tendencies, even if they exist, do<br>
not excuse behavior.<br>

Lola's mention of the Newbury Park shopping development<br>
begs further information, but if it really happens, it will be <br>
by no means unprecedented.  A few years ago the Lake <br>
Region conference tried to develop a shopping center<br>
on the south side of Chicago, with poor financial results,<br>
and their conference president was forced out of office<br>
over the issue.<br>
<p>
None of you thought that an SDA college would sell out to <br>
the conservatives.  But here we go selling out to real estate<br>
developers.  When will we ever learn?  More and more I'm <br>
realizing the blessing of having a local church which is in <br>
fine financial shape.  Any conferences looking for a <br>
Stewardship secretary should contact our current pastor,<br>
I will supply his name on request.<br>

A few weeks ago I wrote about our local church situation<br>
and the supposed controversy over a potential new organ.<br>
It appears that I misrepresented the career, the attitude,<br>
the position, and the competence of one of the key players.<br>
He's not a dentist, but a nutritionist, and he was never for<br>
getting the Wurlitzer organ as I accused him of being. <br>
I apologize for the errors.<br>
<p>
Cooler heads have prevailed, but he has proven to be one <br>
of them.  An organ committee was formed, and they are going to do a very<br>
responsible job of evaluating the leading makes of organs, with an<br>
emphasis on buying quality.  A fund-raising plan will also come into<br>
play.  <br>

Have you heard the one at West Point?  It is unbelievable!<br>
I look at them as testimonies of the creative ability put in<br>
us to point our attention back to God.  Have you heard the<br>
tracker organ at Southern College?  It's quite an instrument<br>
and might rank (get it?) with the one here in Seattle, I'll have to<br>
check on it.  Unfortunately SC is EAST of the Mississippi.<br>
So is Pittsburgh, Steve.  = 0)<br>

<i>&gt;Genetic tendencies, even if they exist, do not excuse behavior.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Steve Timm</i><br>
<p>
Correct, so the issue is the behavior, not the orientation?<br>
Is it the type of sex acts we imagine it to include (which many<br>
heterosexuals practice)?  What makes the difference, the genitalia<br>
of the partner (symbol)?  Is the act separate or void of other variables,<br>
"love", "care", "fidelity" - which we assume all heterosexual relations<br>
contain?<br>
<p>
These aren't easy questions to answer, at least the may make us<br>
uncomfortable and silent.  What would be the most important thing to<br>
know, how dinosaurs became extinct, or the reasons for and surety<br>
of accepting/rejecting a group of people which Christ lived and died<br>
for, and has a will and purpose for, as for all other sinners?<br>

I just wanted to confirm something I heard recently:<br>
<p>
Is it true that three of the four largest pipe organs "west of the <br>
Mississippi" are situated in SDA institutions, with the fourth<br>
(the largest) being in Crystal Cathedral?<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
[I'll defer to west coast colleges.  PUC's organ is large, but<br>
I doubt it is that large.  Certainly in Pittsburgh alone there <br>
are at least five organs bigger than those to be found at any SDA college.<br>
I know there is one giant tracker organ in Seattle, WA at a nonSDA <br>
institution, and the organ at Davies Hall in San Francisco is nothing <br>
to sneeze at.  The absolute largest organ in the USA is at the <br>
US Military Academy in West Point.  SCT]<br>

largest organs west of the Mississippi.  I believe the situation has<br>

About homosexuals:<br>
<p>
I can see with my eyesJesus shouting "Stone him - his is not<br>
worth eternal life because of his lusts and bad behaviour" <br>
<p>
BTW I know at least one SDA pastor that has HS inclinations, but I do also have<br>
my struggles in life. I have a high esteem for these pastors for the job<br>
they are doing, but I will avoid sleeping in the same hotel room - not<br>
because of him but because of me.<br>
<p>
( I am not a homosexual least somebody got the impression, but a happy<br>
husband with a bunch of nice kids)<br>

<i>&gt; US Military Academy in West Point.  SCT]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Let me start with the _Guinness Book of World Records_ (1992, p. 179),<br>
which doesn't help much.  It lists the largest and loudest (!) musical<br>
instrument ever built to be the Auditorium Organ in Atlantic City (now<br>
only partially functional).  The largest fully functional organ is at<br>
the Wanamaker Store in Philadelphia (in another state from Pittsburgh?).<br>
It lists the largest church organ at Passau, Germany with 16,000 pipes,<br>
but then lists the West Point organ at 18,200 pipes.  Go figure, I<br>
guess.<br>
<p>
At any rate, it really doesn't answer the question.  We can only surmise<br>
which the 3 organs might be, but probably Walla Walla, PUC and the Loma<br>
Linda University Church (leaving out an organ or two at La Sierra).<br>
What this sounds like is someone trying to make a point without really<br>
checking out the facts (I used to have a pastor like that--I'd go to the<br>
public library each week to see which facts had been mangled that week,<br>
but that's another story).  In addition to the organ of Davies Hall, in<br>
San Franciso surely one would note those in St. Mary's (Catholic) and<br>
Grace (Episcopalian) cathedrals.  I believe the one in Seattle is in St.<br>
Mark's Cathedral.  I don't know the organs of LA, but likely there are<br>
others there, not to mention San Diego, St. Louis, Denver, Texas, etc.,<br>
etc.  Probably the most egregious oversight in this list, however, is<br>
the monster in the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City (not to mention<br>
the nicer instrument in the Assembly Hall).  It might be interesting to<br>
do a review of Adventist pipe organs sometime, but that sounds more like<br>
a music review and is best left for another occasion.<br>

Beng, this is a reply for your message.  I appreciate your concern about<br>
the homosexual pastor and his claiming that the Bible doesn't mention<br>
anything about homosexual and lesbian, and that you did not find anything<br>
or text in the Bible that talks about that.  First we have to realize that<br>
not everything specific you look for and need to find answers to will be<br>
specifically mention in the Bible.<br>
<p>
The Bible is not an encyclopedia or dictionary, but a book of principles<br>
that you can choose to apply, and to understand it, one must prayerfully<br>
meditate and study with the guidance of the Holy Spirit in order to know<br>
and understnad the will of God in any specific situation we deal with.<br>
<p>
Remember, God created Adam &amp; Eve not Eve &amp; Racheal or Adam &amp; Michael!  He<br>
created a man &amp; a woman (Adam &amp; Eve) and gve them beautiful children - the<br>
kind of family God wants us to be.  If God tells us specifically all<br>
things in details that He does not approve of, the Bible would have been 4<br>
or 5 times or even bigger than it is now!<br>
<p>
Here are some texts that can help you understand and study them<br>
prayerfully so you can understand and be able to share with the homosexual<br>
pastor.  I am not a pastor, but I study God's Word prayerfully and the<br>
Spirit of Prophecy, and without the Holy Spirit's guidance I cannot<br>
understand it.<br>
<p>
1.  GENESIS 1:26&amp;27:  "Then God said, Let us make man; man and maid did he<br>
make them.  And God blessed them and told them, multiply and fill the<br>
earth and subdue it; you are masters of the fish and the birds and all the<br>
animals.<br>
<p>
2.  JUDGES 19:22:  "Just as they were beginning to warm to the occasion, a<br>
gang of sex perverts gathered around the house and began beating at the<br>
door and yelling at the old man to bring out the man who was staying with<br>
him, so they could rape him. (23) The old man stepped outside to talk to<br>
them, "No, my brothers, don't do such a distardly act," he begged, "for he<br>
is my guest." (24) "Here, take my virgin daughter and this man's wife. <br>
I'll bring them out and you can do whatever you like to them--but don't do<br>
such a thing to this man." (25) But they wouldn't listen to him.  Then the<br>
girl's husband pushed her out to them, and they abused her all night,<br>
taking turns raping her until morning."  BENG, PLEASE READ THE WHOLE<br>
CHAPTER SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON!<br>
<p>
3.  ROMANS 1:26-27 (18-32):  "That's why God let go of them and let them<br>
do all these evil things, so that even THEIR WOMEN TURNED AGAINST GOD'S<br>
NATURAL PLAN FOR THEM AND INDULGED IN SEX SIN WITH EACH OTHER.  (27) And<br>
the MEN, INSTEAD OF HAVING A NORMAN SEX RELATIONSHIP WITH WOMEN, BURNED<br>
WITH LUST FOR EACH OTHER, MEN DOING SHAMEFUL THINGS WITH OTHER MEN AND, AS<br>
A RESULT, GETTING PAID WITHIN THEIR OWN SOULS WITH THE PENALTY THEY SO<br>
RICHLY DESERVED.<br>
<p>
VERSE 18-32:  "But God shows his anger from haeaven agianst all sinful<br>
evil men who push away the truth from them.  (19) For the truth about God<br>
is known to them instinctively, God has put this knowledge in their<br>
hearts.  NOTE:  PLEASE READ ON....<br>
<p>
One more thing you cna mention to this pastor:  God created animals and<br>
from the beginning to tis day, animals alwasy have to be opposite sex in<br>
order to produce a family, NEVER THE SAME SEX!<br>
<p>
I suggest that you fast and pray and ask for God's guidance before you  <br>
talk with with pastor again.  I will pray for you and let us continue to<br>
witness for God with love and compassion and a willingness to win a soul<br>
to Christ.  God loves Homosexuals but he condemned the practice and the<br>
sinfulness involved in it.  Les us pray for them all.  Until then, have a<br>
wonderful day, God bless everyone who have excess with this message!<br>

<i>&gt; I believe that a true SDA can surely believe in non-condemnation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; homosexuality.  I am one of them.</i><br>
<p>
I think people have a very hard time differentiating between the act of<br>
homosexuality and the person who commits the act.  God loves all people, but<br>
hates the sin.  Is it possible to love the homosexual but hate (not condone)<br>
their lifestyle?  I believe so.  But for many, they get their feelings and<br>
emotions wrapped up in the thought and can't seem to separate the two.<br>
<p>
If you have children, you can see how it is possible to hate, abhor, disapprove,<br>
etc, of their bad behavior, but you still love the child very much.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You probably won't find anything about lesbians in the scriptures.  At least</i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't found anything but then that is hardly a surprise.  In the</i><br>
<i>&gt; scriptures women are talked about only as a function of males.</i><br>
<p>
Texts have already been mentioned about women and men trading "natural"<br>
relations for "un-natural" ones.  I think that Sodom and Gamorah were guilty of<br>
homosexuality which led to their fiery destruction.  If that isn't an indication<br>
of God's displeasure, then what is?  I would have a hard time believing that<br>
only men were at fault here.  Besides, if "un-natural relations were wrong for<br>
men, would it not also apply for women?<br>
...<br>
<i>&gt; We, none of us, know why a person is a gay, lesbian or a straight person.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt; can, however, observe how difficult it is in our society for a person who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; gay or lesbian.  We, as friends of the Divine One, could perhaps ease this</i><br>
<i>&gt; pain by providing acceptance and love.  We have been told not to judge--when</i><br>
<i>&gt; we condemn persons different from us we are judging.</i><br>
<p>
Again, we must differentiate between the person and the action. We should be<br>
loving to these people, but we should in no way give the impression that we<br>
approve of their actions.  To do so is to approve of homosexuality, which is<br>
clearly stated in the Bible as being abhorant to God.  While we are not to<br>
judge, we are also told to call sin by its right name.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You might talk with a person who is struggling with who they are (e.g. with</i><br>
<i>&gt; their sexual orientation) before you make blanket statements of condemnation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I cannot believe that we are acting as co-workers with the Holy One when we</i><br>
<i>&gt; alienate persons who are different from us.</i><br>
<p>
Good point.<br>

<i>&gt; I believe that a true SDA can surely believe in non-condemnation of</i><br>
<i>&gt; homosexuality.  I am one of them.</i><br>
<p>
I think people have a very hard time differentiating between the act of<br>
homosexuality and the person who commits the act.  God loves all people, but<br>
hates the sin.  Is it possible to love the homosexual but hate (not condone)<br>
their lifestyle?  I believe so.  But for many, they get their feelings and<br>
emotions wrapped up in the thought and can't seem to separate the two.<br>
<p>
If you have children, you can see how it is possible to hate, abhor, disapprove,<br>
etc, of their bad behavior, but you still love the child very much.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You probably won't find anything about lesbians in the scriptures.  At least</i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't found anything but then that is hardly a surprise.  In the</i><br>
<i>&gt; scriptures women are talked about only as a function of males.</i><br>
<p>
Texts have already been mentioned about women and men trading "natural"<br>
relations for "un-natural" ones.  I think that Sodom and Gamorah were guilty of<br>
homosexuality which led to their fiery destruction.  If that isn't an indication<br>
of God's displeasure, then what is?  I would have a hard time believing that<br>
only men were at fault here.  Besides, if "un-natural relations were wrong for<br>
men, would it not also apply for women?<br>
...<br>
<i>&gt; We, none of us, know why a person is a gay, lesbian or a straight person.  We</i><br>
<i>&gt; can, however, observe how difficult it is in our society for a person who is</i><br>
<i>&gt; gay or lesbian.  We, as friends of the Divine One, could perhaps ease this</i><br>
<i>&gt; pain by providing acceptance and love.  We have been told not to judge--when</i><br>
<i>&gt; we condemn persons different from us we are judging.</i><br>
<p>
Again, we must differentiate between the person and the action. We should be<br>
loving to these people, but we should in no way give the impression that we<br>
approve of their actions.  To do so is to approve of homosexuality, which is<br>
clearly stated in the Bible as being abhorant to God.  While we are not to<br>
judge, we are also told to call sin by its right name.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You might talk with a person who is struggling with who they are (e.g. with</i><br>
<i>&gt; their sexual orientation) before you make blanket statements of condemnation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I cannot believe that we are acting as co-workers with the Holy One when we</i><br>
<i>&gt; alienate persons who are different from us.</i><br>
<p>
Good point.<br>

<i>&gt;TANG,</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Did Sue Harrington write her message to SDAnet as a whole?</i><br>
<i>&gt;If so, I missed it somewhere, and it is floating in net-land.  I hope she</i><br>
<i>&gt;consented to you re-posting it because, if not, your including it here is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not appropriate.</i><br>
<p>
Dear Marcus and Sue,<br>
	When i got the original message from sue, i thought it came off<br>
SDAnet, guess i didn't look at the message header. I therefore replied<br>
through Steve. Thankfully, as it turns out, it wasn't a private message<br>
after all. Anyway, it is a good idea for all SDAnetters to mention in the<br>
text of their private messages to each other, that it is not a net message,<br>
in case people like me get them mixed up.<br>

Overall, probably yes.<br>

In some areas, probably not.<br>

If the BATF figures are to be believed, the original warrent<br>
estimated roughly one rifle per member...and I know people in<br>
my church that exceed that number.<br>

Rural communities are somewhat different than urban or suburban.<br>

Hi,<br>
	I think a simple rule of thumb as to what to do on Sabbath might be:<br>
"does it bring me closer to God?" Obviously, doing things for worldly gain,<br>
to get ahead in the world, are out, as are things which distract us from the<br>
things of God. The Sabbath should be spent in an attitude of prayer and<br>
contemplation of God, everything that gets in the way should be laid aside.<br>
Just a thought,<br>

Well I have just found out once again the difference in impact<br>
between public evangelism, "what we preach", and personal evangelism,<br>
"what we practice".<br>
<p>
Our conference hosted a basketball competition last Saturday night,<br>
with twenty-odd teams from around the place competing in a round-robin<br>
tournament. The matches were played at the local basketball stadium, the<br>
same one I play at twice a week in their regular competition.<br>
<p>
I regret to say that the prevailing spirit present was not one of <br>
a friendly social get-together. Although many of us did enjoy the night,<br>
a proportion of those competing exhibited behaviour considerably less<br>
than sporting. As an example (this may have been the worst case - I hope<br>
so), in one particular A-grade match the substitute players continually<br>
mouthed off at the referees, to the extent that a bench tech was given.<br>
This is quite a rare occurrence, even in the professional leagues where<br>
a lot more is at stake. Not to be deterred, the players continued with<br>
their abuse, and a second bench tech was given to the same individual.<br>
(Two personal techs were also given to on-court players during the course<br>
of the game). According to the rules, two techs on a single individual<br>
results in this individual having to leave the playing area. After the<br>
match was over, the team suggested to the referee that he may wish to<br>
accompany them outside to discuss the matter further.<br>
<p>
Dispute and bickering were present in some of the other matches as well,<br>
with both referees and players being the target of verbal abuse and some<br>
physical intimidation. Complaints were made about the fact that some of<br>
the refs were juniors (u/16). This was despite the fact that these were<br>
association refs, had come in especially on a Saturday night, and were<br>
being paid $5 per game as opposed to the $7.60 they receive for a regular<br>
social game on a weeknight. I could go on.<br>
<p>
The refs coordinator is a friend of mine, as I've done some refereeing for<br>
her in the past, and she gets to know a lot of the regular players. On the<br>
Sunday night when I turned up for another game she came over to talk to<br>
some friends and I about the previous evening's activities. (She knows I<br>
am ex-Avondale, and she had seen my friends and I at the competition).<br>
She didn't seem particularly angry, but she was certainly upset over some<br>
of the things that had happened. Some of her comments were,<br>
<p>
"It really wasn't a good night at all. For a bunch of Christians, they<br>
weren't very charitable. If they decide to do it again next year, they will<br>
have to find their own referees. We don't want to ruin our Saturday night<br>
just to get abused, especially for $5 a game."<br>
<p>
She had noticed every single thing that had happened, including the fact<br>
that one disgruntled team had stolen half the trophies when they didn't<br>
make it to the grand final.<br>
<p>
Now I'm no angel, and I have to admit that at times I get a bit hot-headed.<br>
The nature of a physical sport like basketball does predispose a player<br>
towards quick reactions, and sometimes actions and words precede thoughts.<br>
<p>
But I have to ask, why are SDA sporting competitions typified by aggression<br>
and argument? Why is it that a tournament between Christians can result in<br>
more tension in a single night than is usually seen in months of regular<br>
competition? Is avoiding competitive sport the answer? If so, it is <br>
disappointing that an activity which can be a lot of fun, and which can<br>
be enriching both socially, and physically, should need to be avoided.<br>
<p>
If nothing else, this experience has served to remind me once again that<br>
anyone who takes on the label "Christian" becomes a witness, like it or<br>
not. My life is under scrutiny, even when I'm not even aware of it. <br>
Our associates take much more notice of what we practice than of what<br>
we preach, and months of good can be ruined in a single moment. There<br>
isn't any theology in that, it's just bitter experience!!<br>
<p>

Steve, could you please post this (if you think it's appropriate) in <br>
response to all the e-mail notes you forwarded to me?  Thanks!  DG<br>
<p>
****<br>
<p>
It's going to be awhile before I get to personally thank everyone or write<br>
Thank you notes, so this e-mail will have to do in the meantime:<br>
<p>
THANKS for all the cards, visits, phone calls, and thoughts.<br>
<p>
The final story (without too many gory details) is that I developed an<br>
infection on one of the valves of my heart (a valve that I knew was <br>
prolapsed).  This happens to about 2-8% of people with prolapsed valves--I <br>
guess I'm lucky!  The infection evidently sent a clot to my abdomen, <br>
creating appendicitis-like symptoms, which got me into the hospital.  Then a <br>
2nd clot went to my arm (Thank God, not to my brain!), and they had to do <br>
surgery to restore the circulation to my arm.  Then finally, once they had <br>
pumped enough antibiotics into me, they went in and took out the infection <br>
and the affected valve and gave me an artificial valve.  So now, if you're <br>
in the right acoustical position, you can hear my 'click' as my heart <br>
pumps!  Long term, I and my 'click' should be just fine and carry on a <br>
normal life.  In the interim, it's lots of sleep, IV antibiotics three <br>
times a day, and trying not to sneeze or cough while my sternum heals.<br>
<p>
Again, thanks for everything.  I hope to talk to each of you soon.  DG<br>

Steve, could you please post this (if you think it's appropriate) in <br>
response to all the e-mail notes you forwarded to me?  Thanks!  DG<br>
<p>
****<br>
<p>
It's going to be awhile before I get to personally thank everyone or write<br>
Thank you notes, so this e-mail will have to do in the meantime:<br>
<p>
THANKS for all the cards, visits, phone calls, and thoughts.<br>
<p>
The final story (without too many gory details) is that I developed an<br>
infection on one of the valves of my heart (a valve that I knew was <br>
prolapsed).  This happens to about 2-8% of people with prolapsed valves--I <br>
guess I'm lucky!  The infection evidently sent a clot to my abdomen, <br>
creating appendicitis-like symptoms, which got me into the hospital.  Then a <br>
2nd clot went to my arm (Thank God, not to my brain!), and they had to do <br>
surgery to restore the circulation to my arm.  Then finally, once they had <br>
pumped enough antibiotics into me, they went in and took out the infection <br>

Congratulations! Helderberg! for being the culmination of 100 years of SDA<br>
education in South Africa. We're proud of our association with you.<br>
<p>
Here are some prospective goals for the second century:<br>
1.  Obtain a charter for Helderberg--achieve recognized South African<br>
accreditation.<br>
2.  Meaningfully serve all South African Adventists regardless of race.<br>
3.  Achieve national and international recognition for academic<br>
excellence. (EGW: we are to be the head and not the tail!)<br>
4.  Pioneer innovative and effective techniques for bringing the gospel to<br>
the churched and unchurched.<br>
<p>
Best wishes for the future!<br>
Wil &amp; Sylvia Clarke<br>
and the Southern California Helderberg Alumni Chapter.<br>
<p>
Thanks Cecil, for being willing to communicate this with Helderberg!<br>
Greetings to Mandy and ABCD  :)<br>

Isn't there a text that suggests that God's judgment of<br>
human conduct takes into account "that this man was born here<br>
and this one born there. . ."?  Might that not mean that God<br>
will take into account genetic differences?  Tendencies?<br>
<p>
If human justice can take into account privileges, justifications,<br>
and excuses to ameliorate the effects of conduct,  I wonder if<br>
God does?<br>

The problem is not so much in the reliance on sources, but rather on the<br>
claims by church leaders, and to some extent by Mrs. White, that she<br>
did not rely on sources, and that her writings were the result of<br>
special revelation, not the kind of revelation available to the<br>
rest of humanity.  Thus, the plagarism is a minor theme compared<br>
to the unfair and untruthful claims that her millions of words<br>
came by direct revelation of God.  "I put it up on a high shelf<br>
that I might not be influenced by it. . ." is close to one EGW<br>
claim, but the text is so close to the original as to defy credibility.<br>
<p>
Rea really wants people to return to the gospel, and not to use<br>
Mrs. White as if she were "a part of the canon."<br>

There was also the doctroal thesis of Ingmar Linde that disturbed<br>
the SDA community in Sweden. That one learned me that you cannot put<br>
 [1~the Spirit of Prophesy under scientific scrutiny, because science <br>
cannot look at all the dimensions of God.<br>

I note the interest in organs but I don't know how the subject got<br>
started.  One thing that I am quite certain of is this, that the organ<br>
built during the 80's in the Collegedale, TN SDA church is the largest<br>
tracker organ built in the U.S. in the 20th century.  It is both wonderful<br>
to hear and a visual delight.  A second special tracker organ was built<br>
for the music recital hall at Southern College and a third small tracker<br>
for the studio of organist Judy Glass.  All three organs were build by<br>
John Brombaugh (sp?).  All of these organs were built in the tracker (the<br>
keys are mechanically attached to each pipe) style but with such modern<br>
touches such as teflon bushings where tracks were attached to each other.  A<br>
formal concert in the church is something not to be missed.<br>
<p>
Good listening to all.<br>

Whatever Judges 19:22 might be about, I can't believe that a homosexual<br>
act between consenting partners is "worse" than the horrible scene depicted<br>
in this verse. The fact that the man could treat his "virgin daughter" in<br>
this way both astounds and disgusts me. Lets not allow our innate homophobia<br>
to obscure just how awful this "heterosexual" scene really is.<br>

My original source for the statement was the technical guy who came out<br>
to Australia recently accompanying a drama group from La Sierra. I don't<br>
think he was trying to make a point as such, he and I were discussing <br>
various things to do with building acoustics, sound systems, music and so<br>
on, and the fact that at one stage our church was supposed to aquire a<br>
pipe organ. This project has since been "canned", because the donor pulled<br>
out. (More politics I fear!)<br>
<p>
It's great that organ music can point a person upwards to God. Of course,<br>
this isn't always the case, so the question must be: is the financial<br>
investment in such an instrument, along with the necessary acoustic<br>
modifications/design of the building, appropriate considering the mission<br>
of the church as a whole? Even in the local church situation, neglecting<br>
the worldwide church, any building optimized for organ (which it will be<br>
if someone has spent a huge sum of money putting one in), will necessarily<br>
be acoustically poor for many other functions, not the least of which<br>
being speech intelligibility.<br>
<p>
Disclaimer: I myself do enjoy organ music!<br>

It's interesting that the Gospels often have remarkably similar<br>
wordings and don't cite sources.  This also occurs a number of<br>
times elsewhere in the Bible.  Does this mean that some of the<br>
Bible authors were not inspired?<br>

<i>&gt; But I have to ask, why are SDA sporting competitions typified by aggression</i><br>
<i>&gt; and argument? Why is it that a tournament between Christians can result in</i><br>
<i>&gt; more tension in a single night than is usually seen in months of regular</i><br>
<i>&gt; competition? Is avoiding competitive sport the answer? If so, it is </i><br>
<i>&gt; disappointing that an activity which can be a lot of fun, and which can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be enriching both socially, and physically, should need to be avoided.</i><br>
<p>
Doesn't EGW clearly say that SDAs are not to engage in any form of <br>
competitive sport ? And then people go off and wonder why she should <br>
say sauch things.<br>

<i>&gt; If the BATF figures are to be believed, the original warrent</i><br>
<i>&gt; estimated roughly one rifle per member...and I know people in</i><br>
<i>&gt; my church that exceed that number.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rural communities are somewhat different than urban or suburban.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even among SDA's.</i><br>
<p>
At one time, in Alaska, state law required that aircraft flying cross-country<br>
carry a firearm of a minimum size.  This included, of course, the church-owned<br>
aircraft.  It would not surprise me to learn that this requirement was still<br>
in force.  And besides: in Alaska, that makes a lot of sense.<br>
<p>
Any former Alaskan pastors care to comment on that?  :)<br>

<p>
It goes deeper than plagarism charges.  Some people attack Ellen White's<br>
inspiration by implying that if she was a prophet she would not quote<br>
from other sources.  I guess some would say that she could only quote from<br>
other inspired sources.  This, according to my understanding, is a misunderstanding<br>
of how inspiration works in some instances. Bible writers even did research<br>
and used sources.  At least some of them did.  Luke for example.  I believe<br>
it is proven that Ellen White could not be considered a plagiarist by the laws<br>
of her day.  Also people cannot attack her being a prophet solely on the<br>
premise that inspired writers do not quote or use uninspired sources.<br>
<p>
This question about how inspiration works is one that seems to periodically come up<br>
on the SDAnet.  We may get into it again.<br>

Not only in rural, but I know some Adventists who keep guns in the inner<br>
city. This includes leaders and members, even pastors.<br>

Steve, I'm leaving town for 10 days, but if you'll send me a mailing<br>
address I'll give [if I have more  than one copy] THE WHITE LIE<br>

I am at somewhat of a disadvantage while moderating this discussion, because<br>
I have never read Walter Rea's book _The White Lie_ and am currently <br>
bibliographically disadvantaged (no good libraries and no place to buy.)<br>
I suspect that that book may well be out of print, however.  Does anyone<br>
know?  In the early 1980's in Michigan, Good Upstanding Adventist Youth<br>
such as myself didn't even discuss Rea, much less read him.  I might not<br>
have heard of such if not for the article in Time magazine that was <br>
printed at the time.<br>
<p>
To me it seems that there are certain basic questions:<br>
<p>
1)  Are Ellen White's writings in harmony with the Bible?  <br>
2)  What validity did she claim for her own writings?<br>
3)  Do the writings when used properly demonstrate this validity?<br>
4)  Are there any harmful effects that can come from properly applying the<br>
    writings?<br>
<p>
I understand the answers to the above questions to be 1) yes  <br>
2) she claimed to be the Lord's messenger 3) yes  4) no.<br>
<p>
Others have made much more detailed claims for her than she made for <br>
herself.  These needed to be countered.  But I don't think based on what<br>
I've heard that Walter Rea was in the business of doing that.  It seems<br>
that he started with a very narrow view of inspiration, and when the writings<br>
of Ellen White came in conflict with that, he decided to reject the writings<br>
rather than to correct his view.  If anyone has more information <br>
I would be glad to see it.<br>

The largest tracker (mechanical) pipe organ built by an American<br>
organ builder is housed on the campus of Southern College. The<br>
Anton Heiller Memorial Organ was dedicated in approximately 1986<br>
from donations came from funds raised for the college. Much of the<br>
$390,000 came from physicians wanting to contribute to a special<br>
project which would not otherwise be able to exist. Today the<br>
organ is valued at $1.6 million, a good financial investment when<br>
you consider that electronic organs become obsolete in about a 20-year<br>
time frame. This organ will last many generations or perhaps as long<br>
as time will last. A tracker organ lasts for hundreds of years as<br>
those in European cathedrals testify.<br>
<p>
This organ is a fantastic investment for another reason as well:<br>
publicity generated for the college and for the church. This organ<br>
is well-known in America and Europe and is very famous because of<br>
the organ builder who built it. I attracts music lovers and organists<br>
from all over the world to our campus. An "open door" policy is<br>
maintained so other organists are welcome to play it. It is not locked<br>
up (as the pianos in the church are). <br>
<p>
Other reasons:<br>
1. Phillip Glass, a contemporary organist, has just recorded a CD<br>
to be released in August or Sept. The parent company (RCA) sent the<br>
recording team returning from California from recording the Grammies.<br>
This is the same team that records Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan<br>
Opera functions. This was a crew of six. When they saw the organ, the<br>
company sent another crew--a video crew--to film for 2-3 days to make<br>
a promotional for the CD. I doubt any of these people would set foot in<br>
an Adventist Church here otherwise.<br>
<p>
2. Services are broadcast on WSMC every Sabbath. The organ is a prominent<br>
feature and the service attracts people to visit our church to see and<br>
hear the music in person.<br>
<p>
3. Universities bring students here because of the organ.<br>
<p>
4. A very active Elderhostel program occurs at Southern. (Retirees attend<br>
classes at colleges and universities across the country.) These non-SDA<br>
people visit the campus and take courses, one of which is on the organ.<br>
<p>
5. There is a concert series every year.<br>
<p>
6. There is an organ workshop in the summer. These are attended by<br>
overwhelmingly non-SDA.<br>
<p>
7. Churches/schools in the market for purchasing an organ come to this<br>
campus to see and hear this organ.<br>
<p>
I was at another university in another state recently and when one of<br>
the university officials learned I was from Collegedale, he immediately<br>
told me he had visited our church on his honeymoon to hear and see the<br>
organ. He and his bride had heard a concert broadcast nationally on<br>
"Pipe Dreams" and had decided to stop on their way back home. He said<br>
a recording was in progress at the time and that they wanted to return.<br>
They don't play, but they love the music.<br>
<p>
This organ reaches segments of our culture that perhaps would never be<br>
touched or approached by an Adventist. Those detractors who complain<br>
about the money spent on the organ could never purchase the kind of<br>
coverage in any broadcast/mass communication medium for the amount of<br>
money spent. And I haven't even touched on the Southern College students<br>
who are trained here and go out into society as professional musicians<br>
in other churches and their own. Many of the organists in Chattanooga<br>
are Adventists, ministering to others who might never come in contact<br>
with an Adventist. <br>
<p>
When you're in Collegedale, make sure in addition to visiting the<br>
Little Debbie Thrift Store that you see and hear our magnificent organ.<br>

[From Paul Virgo]<br>
<p>
Marcus,<br>
<p>
I got it...read it over and it's very much like Sue..as well as myself.<br>
The idea of not judging but listening and trying to help a person who is<br>
struggling with the concept of being homosexual is something Christ would've<br>
done--if ya were to take the Falwellian view--Christ should've jumped up,when<br>
Mary Magdalene was wiping His feet,and said 'Get this whore away--she is an<br>
abomination to me--I don't care WHAT she says about Me changing her life!<br>
She practices a horrible lifestyle and is condemned to death and eternal<br>
damnation!'<br>
<p>
Doesn't quite sound like the Lord I know and love,does it????<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>

[From John Ash]<br>
Hi all,<br>
<p>
   Well, no longer is there uncensored reading of newsgroups at WWC.  <br>
Evidently the administration finally got wind of all the "evils" which were<br>
available and made a quick &amp; decisive cut.  Here is the notice which was<br>
posted:<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; By order of C. Michael Bell and President Andreasen, the following</i><br>
newsgroups <br>
<i>&gt;   are no longer received on this campus.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.politics.homosexuality</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sex</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sex.bondage</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sex.motss</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sex.movies</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sex.stories</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sexual.abuse.recovery</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sexual.abuse.recovery.d</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sex.fetish.feet</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sex.extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.sex.bestiality.barney</i><br>
<i>&gt; alt.satanism</i><br>
<i>&gt; bit.listserv.gaynet</i><br>
<i>&gt; rec.nude</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any discussion of or disagreements with any of this list should be sent to </i><br>
<i>&gt;   C. Michael Bell (bellmi).  The president is forming a committee to</i><br>
look into<br>
<i>&gt;   the matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; P.S. The news administrator on this machine was not part of this</i><br>
decision.  No<br>
<i>&gt;   flames to ashted, please.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; --</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ted Ashton  (ashted@wwc.edu)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Campus Computer Center   (509) 527-2307</i><br>
<i>&gt; Walla Walla College                         </i><br>
<p>
(For your information, Michael Bell (bellmi@wwc.edu) is the head of the <br>
Campus Computer Center.)<br>
<p>
<p>
   Just a few comments.  It's interesting to look at the above list and<br>
attempt to understand the rationale behind the cuts.  For example, why did <br>
they choose (apparently) to cut ALL groups having to do with SEX and/or <br>
HOMOSEXUALITY, while leaving groups such as alt.tasteless.penis?<br>
<p>
   Maybe that's what the committee is looking into...<br>

It seems to a great extent that a church views its pipe organ as an <br>
extension of its persona.  Although many organists are women, I would say<br>
speaking as a male organist that it is a great feeling of power to have<br>
control over such a large instrument, and I know several female organists<br>
who feel the same way.<br>
<p>
It has been suggested at various times both by our pastor and his various<br>
antagonists on the board that our church in Pittsburgh saw up our pipe organ<br>
for firewood.  Fortunately this has not happened.  But that organ is an <br>
example of how bigger is not necessarily better.  It has twice the size<br>
and twice the number of ranks of the tracker organ in Illinois on which <br>
I play my lessons.  Yet one voice of that tracker can outplay a combination<br>
of several on the other.  There are many situations where less is more<br>
in terms of organ playing.  <br>
<p>
Finally, the point was raised about church mission and "ought we to be<br>
spending $300000 on an organ that will last 200 years when the Lord<br>
is coming soon?"  (especially if the building that houses it will fall down <br>
in 50 yrs or so?)  The Global Mission people had the type of churches<br>
that can afford tracker organs in mind when they planned their material.<br>
The theory of North America as the "pocket" of the church is now openly <br>
in print.  The typical local SDA church exists to preserve itself, make<br>
its members comfortable, and give money so others will do outreach.    <br>
(Note I didn't say that it should be that way, only that it is.)  A <br>
tracker organ fits well into such a mission.<br>
<p>
Churches like that (which are the majority) are good because they separate<br>
the "movers" from the "shakers".  The "movers" get tired of playing games<br>
like the above and head for the mission field.  The "shakers" prefer to <br>
stay where they are in the salt-shaker that houses the salt of the earth.<br>

Within the past couple years, Worthington Foods bought out its major <br>
competitor in the meat analog market, Loma Linda Foods, and became the <br>
predominant supplier of such.  Has anybody noticed that the price of <br>
various things has gone up considerably since that time?  It seems to <br>
be doing so.  If it is happening, is it because Worthington is just <br>
enjoying their monopoly or because sales are down and they need a higher<br>
margin on what they sell?<br>

I have been following this thread on homosexuality, which started out<br>
questioning whether female homosexuality was mentioned in the<br>
Scriptures.  I think it has been pretty clear that the Scriptures do<br>
prohibit such acts.  But I would like to make some other comments on the<br>
subject.<br>
<p>
For several years, I have had a semi-ministry to homosexuals.  Unlike<br>
colin Cook's and others, who sought to help those who already were<br>
Christians, I decided to reach homosexuals who did not yet know Christ. <br>
One way I did this was to send Christian literature to personal ads in a<br>
local gay magazine.  So far I have only had one person actually come to<br>
Christ through this method.  And I did get several death threats, and<br>
some sincere inquiries.  (The death threats were the reason I used a<br>
post office box and no last name.)<br>
<p>
One thing that must be mentioned is that although the Scriptures call<br>
homosexuality an abomination, it is not the worst of all sins. Proverbs<br>
6 also calls lying tongues, and those that sow strife between brothers<br>
an abomination, also.  Having access to the Reformed Presbyterian<br>
Theological Seminary here in Pittsburgh, I was able to check the<br>
original Hebrew in both passages.  From this, I would imagine God views<br>
all of these types of sin with equal disgust.<br>
<p>
However, the Christian Church has historically treated homosexuality as<br>
a different sin.  A person could be addicted to three different<br>
narcotics, or could have ax murdered his parents, or been involved in<br>
any number of gross sins, and the Church's plea has always been, "Come<br>
to Christ, come into the fellowship of His Church, and we willhelp you<br>
deal with your problems."  But when it comes to homosexuality, the<br>
Church has usually said, "Straighten out your life first, and then come<br>
to Christ.  And after you do, you will be watched closely, and will<br>
never be trusted to lead the youth group, or be in ;the men's<br>
fellowship.  And you better get married soon, to prove that Christ<br>
really changed you and that you are truly repentant."<br>
<p>
Pity this jperson if he should ever fall back into the sin of<br>
homosexuality.  However, I know that I have told at least one lie since<br>
my conversion.  According to that passage in Proverbs, I have committed<br>
an abomination.<br>
<p>
Some posters talked about seperating the sin from the sinner.  That is<br>
really wishy washy, and I don't think God looks at it that way.  A<br>
person who steals is a thief.  A person who kills is a murderer.  A<br>
person who does not speak the truth is a liar.  A person who has sex<br>
with members of his own sex is a homosexual.  <br>
<p>
When Christ comes in judgment, these people will be destroyed.  God is<br>
holding these objects of his wrath until then.  (Read Romans 9)  When a<br>
thief is put in jail, the PERSON is put in jail, not his actions.  <br>
<p>
As a Church, we must learn to accept the homosexual, and his behaviour,<br>
but without approving of it.  Then when they are led to Christ, over<br>
time, as they renew and transform their minds, they will change.  And it<br>
does take time, and they will sometimes fall.  But that is what the<br>
Church is for, to bring them back.  <br>

<i>&gt;    Well, no longer is there uncensored reading of newsgroups at WWC.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Evidently the administration finally got wind of all the "evils" which were</i><br>
<i>&gt; available and made a quick &amp; decisive cut.  Here is the notice which was</i><br>
<i>&gt; posted:</i><br>
<p>
(*list of censored newsgroups *)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sexual.abuse.recovery</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sexual.abuse.recovery.d</i><br>
<p>
I can understand the rest of the groups being deleted, but I do believe <br>
these two should stay, inasmuch as they are kind of "group therapy"<br>
sessions for healing from sexual abuse.<br>

Due to an unfortunate and I presume inadvertent bypass of moderation<br>
by Jerry Wiley, he sent a message that was intended for my <br>
eyes only to the net.  There have been responses to that inadvertent<br>

I have to take issue with the idea that the BD were stockpiling weapons.  <br>
They owned about 1 gun per person.  Many SDA's own more than that.  From <br>
what I've heard of BD theology, the BD were stockpiling weapons to defend <br>
themselves in case of a war (i.e. Armeggedon).  Please prove me wrong on <br>
that one.<br>

<i>&gt; It's interesting that the Gospels often have remarkably similar</i><br>
<i>&gt; wordings and don't cite sources.  This also occurs a number of</i><br>
<i>&gt; times elsewhere in the Bible.  Does this mean that some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bible authors were not inspired?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Dave Plaisted</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Basic logic would force people to use the same yardstick that they condemn<br>
Ellen White with to condemn the Gospel writers.<br>
<p>
When I have questioned some about that point, they either deny that the<br>
bible writers used sources, say that the only sources that the Bible<br>
writers used were inspired, or just ignore the question.<br>

on the fip side of this, Worthington products are finaly available in<br>
a lot of stores.  I can go to Fiesta mart and get LaLoma, an Worthington<br>
products, down to the local HEB and get Morning Start Farms (Worthington<br>
etc.)  This is a far cry from 3 years or so ago when you could only find<br>
these at ABC stores etc.<br>

<i>&gt; Within the past couple years, Worthington Foods bought out its major </i><br>
<i>&gt; competitor in the meat analog market, Loma Linda Foods, and became the </i><br>
<i>&gt; predominant supplier of such.  Has anybody noticed that the price of </i><br>
<i>&gt; various things has gone up considerably since that time?  It seems to </i><br>
<i>&gt; be doing so.  If it is happening, is it because Worthington is just </i><br>
<i>&gt; enjoying their monopoly or because sales are down and they need a higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; margin on what they sell?</i><br>
<p>
I don't know about this, but it is very interesting to me that here in<br>
Berrien Springs I can buy these products MUCH cheaper at Schraders, the<br>
local non-SDA supermarket, than at Apple Valley, the Adventist market.<br>
I mean, Fri-Chik is usually at least $0.50 cheaper per can than what<br>
Apple Valley sells it for!  You'd think that we could sell it the<br>
cheapest of all.....!<br>

It seems as though there are so many concerns about the "White Lie" by<br>
Walter Rae.  I have never seen this man in person, but I have heard a lot<br>
about him, and I have seen his book.  When I started to read it, I have<br>
discovered that I will waste my time reading it, and there are other<br>
important books to read than this one.<br>
<p>
Whatever he wrote about Ellen G. White, let him believe the way he does,<br>
but for me I truly believe that Mrs. White was the chosen prophet of God, and<br>
that ALL her writings were inspired.<br>
<p>
Every time I read her books, I am always feel inspired and uplifted by<br>
them.  But she also warned us that we should not put  <br>
her writings above the Word of God.  The Bible is the greater light, and her<br>
writings are the lesser light that makes us understand the greater light.<br>
Sometimes it's a waste of time to discuss issues like this.  Our hope is<br>
to see Jesus, and to prepare our lives for heaven.  Only when we allow the<br>
Holy Spirit to guide us, that we will find the truth, but whatever<br>
controversy that is going on in our church, all have to do with human<br>
understanding, and their own interpretation, because THE SPIRIT ONLY LEAD<br>
US TO ALL TRUTH, not to SOME, but to ALL TRUTH.  <br>
<p>
We have also received at James White Library a book written by a former<br>
adventist couple who were both brought up in an adventist home, and both<br>
attended our adventist institutes, taught at one of our Academies, but<br>
once the husband read this book, he believed it, and left the  church, and<br>
he's been attacking the church ever since.  He belongs to another<br>
denomination, and said that he has never been so rich since he left the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist church.  So I encourage everyone that if you based<br>
your opinion on someone else's without seeking the guidance of the Spirit,<br>
you will be lead astray.  (This book is in the Adventist Heritage Center)<br>
<p>
Please pray for one another, and those who have left the church so one of<br>
these days they will understand.  Also pray that the Holy Spirit will give<br>
us decernment in order to understand His Word fully!<br>

Steve, I have corrected some spelling errors, and expanded the list<br>
slightly.  Please post this over SDA net.<br>
<p>
<p>
	This is a partial list of questions.  I have been searching madly<br>
for the complete list of questions before posting this, but have had so <br>
many requests that I feel I need to get something out.  It has been most <br>
interesting, as I have found answer sheets dating back to the first year<br>
of our marriage.  The answers are really revealing, and I have been able to <br>
reconstruct some of the missing questions.  My wife and I started out doing<br>
54 or so questions every sunday.  That took 2 hours, and got to be a real <br>
drag.  Later we pared the list down to 19 or so.<br>
<p>
RULE #1:	ADHERE TO THE RULES, and INSTRUCTIONS<br>
<p>
INSTRUCTIONS:<br>
<p>
	Pick a time when you can devote a couple of hours to this <br>
excercise without interruption.  Each spouse is to take a copy of the <br>
questions, and write down the answers.  This should be done without <br>
interference from the other spouse.  Go to opposite sides of the room if <br>
you have to.  When you are finished, draw up 2 chairs facing one another.  <br>
Get them close enough so your knees touch (This is not super essential, you <br>
can sit on the couch, but be prepared for position changes.  You won't <br>
believe the body language that some of these questions can elicit. Before <br>
you answer or discuss these questions have a word of prayer together, <br>
praying for each other.  <br>
<p>
RULE #2 *********** IN THE CASE OF A SEVERE CONFLICT, SET A TIME, AND DATE <br>
		    A COUPLE OF DAYS INTO THE FUTURE TO SIT DOWN AND <br>
		    DISCUSS THE ISSUE.  THIS IS CRITICAL.  YOU *WILL* FIND <br>
		    THAT THIS EXCERCIZE CREATES (UNCOVERS HIDDEN) <br>
		    FRICTIONS.  THAT IS IT'S PURPOSE, TO GET THE UNDERLYING <br>
		    STUFF OUT IN THE OPEN TO BE DEALT WITH.  DO **NOT** GET<br>
		    EMOTIONAL!!!!!!!!<br>
		   <br>
I can't stress rule 2 strongly enough.  This must be agreed to by both <br>
parties BEFORE you start.  Conflict resolution is beyond the scope of this <br>
post, though you need to know that there are 3 basic ways of handling <br>
conflict.  Agreeing to dis-agree, capitulation (one of the parties) or <br>
compromise (both parties).  It helps to reveiw this when a conflict comes <br>
up, and discuss these things when you set your date for conflict <br>
resolution.<br>
<p>
<p>
RULE #3:<br>
	*****AVOID the following words. "always, never, all the time,"  <br>
	i.e. absolutes.  They are ALWAYS false, and are known as "fighting" <br>
	words.  Avoid them in your written answers and well as your verbal <br>
	ones.  <br>
	<br>
RULE #4:<br>
	Agree on an "ouch".  This makes good common sense all the time, not <br>
	just when you are answering questions.  What is an "ouch"?  Well <br>
	you pick a word or clue that BOTH spouses agree on, and what it <br>
	means is "that hurt...or that is a sensitive area, and we need to <br>
	discuss it, or your just embarassed me"  When ever and of those <br>
	things happens in day to day conversation, the verbal or visual <br>
	clue will let the spouse know that the other persons feelings have <br>
	been hurt, and/or they want to talk about it.<br>
	<br>
RULE #5:<br>
	Use "I percieve..." when talking about things with the otherm <br>
	spouse that your can't know.  You will note that I use the word in <br>
	the questions below.  It is not arbitrary.  It tells the other <br>
	person that you see things one way, but are willing to be <br>
	corrected.  Use it in every day speech.  "I percieve that"  is a <br>
	lot better than "You do".<br>
	<br>
	<br>
INSTRUCTIONS CONTINUED:<br>
<p>
	Once the questions have been answered, and you are comfortably <br>
	situated, exchange answer sheets, and take turns reading the <br>
	answers to the questions to each other.  Explore the other persons <br>
	answers with them, allowing them to elaborate as needed.<br>
	<br>
That is about it, except for brainstorming.<br>
<p>
	This will almost invariably uncover areas of common goals.  One of <br>
	the ways to zero in on things that can improve or aid the <br>
	achieveing of these goals is brain storming.  This is a rather <br>
	simple excercise.  Take a pad of paper, and designate one person to <br>
	be the recorder.  Each person takes turns giving a one or two word <br>
	phrase relating to the topic. If you can't think of any, then just <br>
	say pass. DO NOT ELABORATE AT THIS TIME.  When you have 10 or so <br>
	items down, stop and go back over them, combining the duplicates <br>
	(elaborate as needed).  Then rank order them from most important to <br>
	least important or most useful to least useful or most doable to <br>
	least doable.<br>
	<br>
	This will enable your to narrow down, and focus on solutions to <br>
	problems.  This proceedure can be used in any size group for any <br>
	kind of consensus seeking.<br>
<p>
Well I need to get back to work.  I will try to put more together later.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
NOTE:	Each of these questions can be expanded to include children<br>
	as well.  This was set up for just my wife and I.  You can select<br>
	a few of these questions to do with your children.  It will help <br>
	them to set goals, and discuss them.<br>

In response to the list of censored newsgroups at WWC, I am surprised<br>
they decided to cut alt.sexual.abuse.recovery.  I have never read<br>
this newsgroup (or any of the others, for that matter), but it<br>
doesn't sound like an immoral topic to me.  In fact, it sounds like<br>
it could be a valuable forum and information exchange for those who<br>
have suffered sexual abuse.<br>
<p>
Why was it excluded?  I can speculate on some possibilities:<br>
<p>
(1)  alt.sexual.abuse.recovery was censored because it has "sex" in<br>
its name and no one thought about it very carefully when constructing<br>
the list.<br>
<p>
(2) The newsgroup is not what its name would suggest, and the WWC<br>
administration knows that.<br>
<p>
(3) This is a deliberate attempt to sweep the problem of sexual abuse<br>
under the rug and squelch any discussion on the topic.  (Did any of<br>
you see the appalling letters written to the Adventist Review after<br>
they did a piece on sexual abuse?)<br>
<p>
Unless the real reason is number (2) above this decision should be<br>
changed.  Those at WWC who could benefit from such a newsgroup may<br>
be the last to speak out against it being censored, so its up to the<br>
rest of us to defend their rights.<br>

<i>&gt; I note the interest in organs but I don't know how the subject got</i><br>
<i>&gt; started.  One thing that I am quite certain of is this, that the organ</i><br>
<i>&gt; built during the 80's in the Collegedale, TN SDA church is the largest</i><br>
<i>&gt; tracker organ built in the U.S. in the 20th century.  It is both wonderful</i><br>
<i>&gt; to hear and a visual delight.  A second special tracker organ was built</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the music recital hall at Southern College and a third small tracker</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the studio of organist Judy Glass.  All three organs were build by</i><br>
<i>&gt; John Brombaugh (sp?).  All of these organs were built in the tracker (the</i><br>
<i>&gt; keys are mechanically attached to each pipe) style but with such modern</i><br>
<i>&gt; touches such as teflon bushings where tracks were attached to each other.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; formal concert in the church is something not to be missed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Good listening to all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bill Allen</i><br>
<p>
Just a clarification.  I was a student at Southern College when this<br>
organ was put in and I don't believe that the two organs in the Music<br>
building were specially built for the Music dept.  I do believe there<br>
are two organs there - one in the recital hall and one in Judy Glass's<br>
office - but one of these had been the church organ for a number of years <br>
before the new one was built.  When the new one was installed, the old<br>
one was moved to the Music building.<br>
<p>
And to confirm what Bill says, the new (I guess it's not new any more!)<br>
organ IS beautiful to see and hear!  My wife and I were married in the<br>
church and were the first ones to have the organ used for a wedding!<br>
John Brombaugh (sp?) was still working on it the day we were married!<br>

My pastor's secretary just called me... (what quick help!) and said that<br>
the thought comes from a text: Psalms 87: 6.  The New International<br>
Version says:  "The Lord will write in the register of the people: 'This<br>
one was born in Zion'."  I'm not sure how the King James Version reads.<br>
If this makes it to the net today, please, anyone with the KJV handy,<br>
post what it says.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; But I have to ask, why are SDA sporting competitions typified by aggression</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and argument? Why is it that a tournament between Christians can result in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more tension in a single night than is usually seen in months of regular</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; competition? Is avoiding competitive sport the answer? If so, it is </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; disappointing that an activity which can be a lot of fun, and which can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be enriching both socially, and physically, should need to be avoided.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't EGW clearly say that SDAs are not to engage in any form of </i><br>
<i>&gt; competitive sport ? And then people go off and wonder why she should </i><br>
<i>&gt; say sauch things.</i><br>
<p>
I have heard stories about people pulling guns at basketball games between<br>
adventist churches.  These tournements do not cause any problems, but they<br>
show us the problems that are deep within us.  In this country we are taught<br>
from birth that victory for someone means defeat for another.  We praise <br>
victory.  This leads us to the belief that winning is everything. Our whole<br>
economic system is built on using any edge that is possible to make more<br>
money for yourself.  We teach our young to cheer for the home team and <br>
boo the opposing team.  When our opponent makes a mistake we cheer.  Some of us<br>
even cheer when a player on the opposing team is injured.  It is now easier <br>
for your team to win.<br>
<p>
I believe something is wrong when we are happy at the mistakes of our opponents.<br>
Because we cannot conceive of a system that was not built on beating the other<br>
man we think that it is unnatural to have any other system but competitive.<br>
<p>
I believe something is wrong when we derive pleasure from the subjigation of<br>
an opponent.  The spirit of Jesus is to build up others.  To want the best for<br>
others.  To even give up your life for others.  Is the spirit of competition<br>
compatible with that?  I believe that is the question.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; if ya were to take the Falwellian view--Christ should've jumped up, when</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mary Magdalene was wiping His feet,and said 'Get this whore away--she is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; abomination to me--I don't care WHAT she says about Me changing her life!</i><br>
<i>&gt; She practices a horrible lifestyle and is condemned to death and eternal</i><br>
<i>&gt; damnation!'</i><br>
<i>&gt; Doesn't quite sound like the Lord I know and love,does it????</i><br>
<p>
And what did the Lord, Who we know and love, say when she was caught?<br>
<p>
JOHN 8:4-11:  They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery,<br>
    in the very act.  Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be<br>
    stoned: but what sayest thou? This they said, tempting him, that they<br>
    might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger<br>
    wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.  So when they continued<br>
    asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without<br>
    sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.  And again he stooped<br>
    down, and wrote on the ground.  And they which heard it, being convicted<br>
    by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest,<br>
    even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in<br>
    the midst.  When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman,<br>
    he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man<br>
    condemned thee?  She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, NEITHER<br>
    DO I CONDEMN THEE: GO, AND SIN NO MORE.<br>
<p>
No approbation of her lifestyle, but hope and encouragement to live as a<br>
new creature in Christ.  Interestingly, Simon at whose feast Mary washed<br>
the feet of Jesus, was the very one who had earlier led Mary into adultery<br>
(whence into prostitution).  He felt that Jesus, if He were Christ, would<br>
not let her touch Him .. but He did.  So, what can we learn?<br>
<p>
0)  It is not clear, btw, that Mary was adulterous at the time she washed<br>
    His feet.  As to the past .. God remembers forgiven sins no more,<br>
    forever (Jer 31:34); we, unfortunately, tend to.<br>
<p>
1)  Jesus wants to save us from sin, not wanting any to perish (Jn 3:16-17).<br>
<p>
2)  Jesus cannot help those who think they have no need of Him (Luke 5:32,<br>
    18:10-14; Matt 5:3-9, 9:12; Rev 3:15-21).  Simon was self-righteous;<br>
    Mary *knew* she was messed up and needed help to escape her lifestyle.<br>
    Attitude (pride vs humility) is what makes the difference.<br>
<p>
3)  The Pharisees taught that there was no forgiveness for certain sins,<br>
    crushing the hopes of those who realized their folly and who wanted<br>
    to turn their lives around; Jesus taught that there was forgiveness<br>
    for the repentant (e.g., Mark 2:3-12; cf EGW comments thereon in DA).<br>
    The man with palsy found hope when he heard of God's goodness and love<br>
    (cf Matt 5:45, 1 Jn 4:19) towards all, healings, etc, and was led to<br>
    repentance (cf Rom 2:4).<br>
<p>
4)  There is no condemnation for those in Christ, who walk after the Spirit<br>
    (Rom 8:1); rather they become as dead to sin (e.g., read what EGW has to<br>
    say in P&amp;P about how Joseph in Egypt kept himself pure), continuing no<br>
    more (Rom 6:1-4):<br>
	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may<br>
	abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any<br>
	longer therein? Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized<br>
	into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are<br>
	buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was<br>
	raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we<br>
	also should walk in newness of life.<br>
<p>
5) Christ's robe of righteousness does not cover unconfessed and unforsaken<br>
   sin (1 Jn 1:9; cf EGW comments on these topics).<br>

Luke 22:35-36, 38 - This is no spiritual sword being discussed, implies to<br>

There is a vast difference between the use of defensive and offensive force.<br>

If we are to "resist evil", I don't believe that we should resist only<br>
spiritual evil, and not necessarily refrain from physical resistance (which<br>
could, of course, involve non-violent forms of resistance...and should, if<br>
at all possible).<br>
<p>
I see nothing admirable in not resisting a rapist or other violent criminal,<br>
allowing him to go on to harm other innocents in the future.<br>
<p>
This, of course, is a course of action that must be left up to the conscience<br>
of each individual. I believe that coercion either way is wrong, too.<br>

You're right, the story in Judges is disgusting and awful; the sordid<br>
details continue on for several more chapters.  Fortunately, Scripture<br>
does not leave us guessing as to why it's recorded; see Judges 21:25:<br>
    ... every man did that which was right in his own eyes.<br>
The record is to teach us the consequences of departing from God's ways.<br>
<p>
Maybe I missed a post, but I did not see anyone comparing homosexuality<br>
versus this story and saying homosexuality was worse.  Nor did I see anyone<br>
trying to obscure, hide, or mitigate the heinous nature of what happened.<br>
I submit that both are perversions of God's purposes for our sexuality.<br>

Here are a few additional thoughts about church pipe organs.  At least<br>
in an educational environment, an organ such as this will be amortized<br>
over many thousands of hours of use, not only for services but for<br>
practice and lessons.  When I was a student here at Andrews, the<br>
practice schedule for the Casavant in the church was so full that some<br>
students (more dedicated than I) literally practiced in the middle of<br>
the night.  In the end, it's a matter of priorities.  A few years ago<br>
some of the science/technology faculty at Duke University were appalled<br>
when someone gave a fabulous new tracker organ (a Flentrop that I prefer<br>
to the Brumbaugh at SC because of its less severe sound) for the chapel.<br>
How much better the money would have been spent (so some thought) if it<br>
were used for scientific research, a new computer (which by now would<br>
have been long outdated and discarded), etc.  If it's true that organs<br>
are mainly for women (and I won't agree to that), is it possible that<br>
the "boys with the toys" just wanted a different toy (perhaps a new<br>
sound system or even a TV ministry)?<br>
<p>
When contemplating purchase of an "organ for the ages" one must also<br>
assume that there will be maintenance costs, sometimes significant ones<br>
(like rebuilding).  The pipework may tend to last, but many of the other<br>
mechanical things do not.  They wear out, as has happened here.  That<br>
heavy organ use has literally worn out the console.  Now there seems to<br>
be no money to replace it.  Those European organs that have survived<br>
hundreds of years (even through wars) have certainly not done so without<br>
maintenance and regular rebuilding.<br>
<p>
Tony is right in pointing out an acoustics problem.  However, it is a<br>
larger one than organs.  It is difficult to do anything musically in a<br>
dull acoustic.  Perhaps an improvement in church deportment is in order.<br>
One does not need to pad up a church (making it more like a bedroom than<br>
a place to worship God) in order to deaden noise that has not been made.<br>
Adventist churches, at least in North America, have become rather noisy<br>
places.<br>

As a librarian, I am sorry to see Steve be bibliographically<br>
disadvantaged!  We wouldn't want to wish that on anybody.  Again let me<br>
remind you that (partly through the power of computers) libraries worldwide<br>
are tied together through interlibrary loan.  Even a small library can<br>
obtain specialized items of interest.  As long as we have adequate staff<br>
to support it, we even supply ILLs with no fees to SDA libraries and<br>
even other libraries if we are informed that the material is for an SDA<br>
(we feel that the church at large is "owner" of the university and of<br>
the James White Library).<br>
<p>
I cannot agree with those who argue for ignorance of important books<br>
that examine or even challenge traditional understandings.  Steve<br>
certainly could have read the book when he was here at Andrews, as it is<br>
(and was) available in the library and I believe in an open way (unlike<br>
the previous incident with Numbers' book).  I don't know if the book is<br>
still available or not.  It was privately published (Turlock, CA:  M &amp; R<br>
Publications, 1982) by the author.  I believe he still lives in that<br>
area (Patterson, possibly, I don't remember).  If you're really<br>
interested, we might be able to find something in the Adventist Heritage<br>
Center.  The name, BTW, is Walter T. Rea.  <br>
<p>
It's been a long time since I read the book, but my memory is of a lot<br>
of documentation but a bitter tone--one of betrayal.  Apparently he had<br>
been a real worshipper of Ellen White and thus tried to duplicate and<br>
read her personal library.  This was when he discovered the<br>
anacknowledged borrowings.  He then experienced cognitive dissonance<br>
with what he had believed, based on what the church (especially the<br>
White Estate) promoted--essentially an original author whose works are<br>
inerrant.  Jerry is right in noting that the biggest problem is not so<br>
much the borrowing as it is the way she is portrayed.  She had become an<br>
inerrant authority on everything, although this idea had already been<br>
thoroughly debunked by Numbers, Peterson, McAdams and others.  I think<br>
Rea expected the church to make an open admission of these problems and<br>
find a new hermeneutic of Ellen White.  He was also apparently unwilling<br>
or unable to work with the rather slow committee structure of the<br>
church.  While he uncovered much important information, he was not as<br>
careful as he should have been in interpreting it or using it.<br>
<p>
In the end, his work has probably not had much impact on the church as a<br>
whole because apparently there is little desire to change understandings<br>
and practices.  It is interesting that the relationship between the<br>
church leadership and a live Ellen White (much conflict, including an<br>
exile in Australia) is quite different than it is with a dead Ellen<br>
White (much easier to "control").  The historical role of the White<br>
Estate and its changing interpretations of her writing would be<br>
an interesting historical study.  On one thing, however, they never<br>
change--her authority (and theirs to interpret her).  My observation of<br>
the operation of the White Estate is that it's more a shrine than a<br>
place for serious historical study (although there are many important historical documents there).  It is interesting to note that on this campus that<br>
while the Ellen White Research Center is located in the James White<br>
Library (in recent years) it is not part of the library (as it is, sort<br>
of, at Loma Linda).  Their purpose and methods are quite different than<br>
ours.<br>

good post about the organ -- it gives the other side of the story.<br>
I'd only heard complaints about the expense.<br>

There's a book called The White Truth by some SDA publisher that<br>
attempts to refute The White Lie.  But I don't think it does as<br>
good a job as it could have.<br>

Dan, I hardly buy the vege can or frozen food from Apple Valley or<br>
anywhere, I have discovered the same problem you have, but I make my own<br>
homemade gluten at home and put my own flavor.  The one from the store are<br>
so high of salt that is not really good.  But is is sorry to know that our<br>
own SDA stores sell them so high then those who are not.  My homemade<br>
gluten can be stored in the freezer right away and I will grind them or<br>
sliced them in pieces for mixing with vegetables or any special dish I made.<br>

<i>&gt; But it is sad to know that our &gt; own SDA stores sell them so high ...</i><br>
<p>
We haven't comparison shopped the vege-food "health" foods (Loma Linda,<br>
et al) at any point; our local supermarket carries them, btw.  As we've<br>
been recently eating less refined products and making more of our own,<br>
we only rarely buy off-the-shelf [*].  However, I have noticed that foods<br>
considered "natural" or "health" are invariably premium priced, esp<br>
if you buy at a "health food" store.  Examples:<br>
* No-sugar-added corn flakes (by some company in Calif) at Hi-Health<br>
  (local chain) are considerably pricier than Kellogg's corn flakes,<br>
  let alone generic or store brand corn flakes.<br>
* Ezekiel bread at Hi-Health is steeper than Oroweat at the grocer's<br>
  (let alone Price Club, Costco, Sam's, whatever you have) which in<br>
  turn is steeper than Wonder (ghastly stuff).  To supplement what<br>
  we make at home, we get Weimar to drop ship us some (excellent!) at a<br>
  price between Ezekiel and Oroweat.<br>
* Granola packaged "healthy" and in the "natural" section is spendier<br>
  than "regular" brand granola (15 cents/oz), despite the contents being<br>
  nearly identical.  Bulk granola is sometimes 13c/oz.  We get ours from Weimar<br>
  (no sugar) at a price (even with shipping) competitive with brand name.<br>
<p>
So, I guess it's not over surprising that LL vegefoods are premium, if<br>
you think like a Harvard School of Business-type.<br>
<p>
[*] I have to confess 8-) that in Oregon, we would buy Garden Burgers, um-yum.<br>
    They're a local specialty.  Fortunately for my deprived taste buds,<br>
    we've found a recipe that's nearly as good.<br>

I'm not sure if this made it to you Steve:<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Bruce, don't leave us up a creek without a boat on this one.<br>
<p>
HOW, exactly are we to love the sinner but hate the sin?  How, are we<br>
suppose to know when, I assume, "Godly love" for the 'sinner' should<br>
end, and condoning begin?  Can you, or anyone help in explaining<br>
this?  There are people who are out to make sure that homosexuals<br>
do not have jobs or homes... (especially if they are honest about who<br>
they are) where is the Bible on this, where is the Church on this?<br>
If they support this type of anti-gay work, why are they silent?<br>
If they reject it, why are they silent?  People are perishing, now isn't the<br>
time to be silent.<br>
<p>
The Sodom story isn't a good one to use against homosexuality.<br>
The Bible says that literally, ALL the men of Sodom were at Lot's<br>
house the night of the destruction.  This is a bit more than even 10%<br>
of the population...  Was Sodom an all-gay town?  If anything, the<br>
destruction of Sodom is due to committing homosexual [rape] on<br>
strangers if not angels.  Rape is more an issue of "power", self exalting,<br>
disrespect, contempt for the other persons, than an out of control lust.<br>
I understand that males raping males in ancient culture was an ultimate<br>
way to demean, and was used often to "crown" a victorious war.<br>
Couple this with the societal beliefs regarding gender status, and the<br>
assumed meaning for the destruction applies less fittingly.<br>
<p>
I once heard a Loma Linda U. professor speak about what some<br>
today call sexism, and gender-centric in the style of biblical writing<br>
(due to culture).  Maybe we should learn more background info behind<br>
some of the texts.<br>

I have a friend who is a new Seventh-day Adventist christian. I will call her <br>
Mary.  She was converted about three years ago.  She is very on fire for the <br>
Lord and is going about witnessing with great zeal.  She recently became <br>
convicted by God that women are to wear conservative dresses.  This means<br>
that only conservative dresses are to be worn, slacks are not ok to <br>
wear regardless of the circumtance.  There was a work bee to clear land for <br>
a new church and school, and Mary came in a dress.<br>
 <br>
I have another friend, that I will call Sue.  She is a much newer <br>
Seventh-day Adventist christian.  Both friends go to the same church.  Mary <br>
is going about convicting Sue that she also should only wear conservative <br>
dresses.<br>
  <br>
Sue doen't really believe this, but doesn't know how to refute what<br>
Mary says, especially when Mary backs it up with the Bible and Mrs White.<br>
(I do not know the passages used).  Sue recently gave away a pretty<br>
dress, that did not meet all of Mary's criteria, but is regretful that she <br>
did.  <br>
 <br>
Sue wants to do what is right and to know what God wants for her to do.<br>
 <br>
I would like to know if those on SDAnet know of any references in the<br>
Bible or in what Ellen White has written that could give Sue some<br>
guidance.   <br>
<p>
Thanks much<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<p>
Post from Richard Behrens:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In response to the list of censored newsgroups at WWC, I am surprised</i><br>
<i>&gt; they decided to cut alt.sexual.abuse.recovery.  I have never read</i><br>
<i>&gt; this newsgroup (or any of the others, for that matter), but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't sound like an immoral topic to me.  In fact, it sounds like</i><br>
<i>&gt; it could be a valuable forum and information exchange for those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; have suffered sexual abuse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why was it excluded?  I can speculate on some possibilities:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (1)  alt.sexual.abuse.recovery was censored because it has "sex" in</i><br>
<i>&gt; its name and no one thought about it very carefully when constructing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the list.</i><br>
<p>
   I believe this was the reason.  From what I can see, the administration<br>
(upon hearing of such "evils") decided to take quick action by suspending<br>
all groups containing the word "sex"--as well as a few other groups.  Once <br>
this was done, a committee was formed to look into the situation<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (2) The newsgroup is not what its name would suggest, and the WWC</i><br>
<i>&gt; administration knows that.</i><br>
<p>
   I spent a good deal of time perusing the groups mentioned and found this<br>
one (alt.sexual.abuse.recovery) to be especially nice.  I would highly<br>
recommend it to anyone who has had an abusive background.  Most of the posts<br>
go through some sort of a system to keep the posters anonymous, thus helping<br>
them to speak freely.  There is heartwarming support and encouragement in <br>
many of the posts.  Don't just take my word... go and see for yourself.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (3) This is a deliberate attempt to sweep the problem of sexual abuse</i><br>
<i>&gt; under the rug and squelch any discussion on the topic.  (Did any of</i><br>
<i>&gt; you see the appalling letters written to the Adventist Review after</i><br>
<i>&gt; they did a piece on sexual abuse?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless the real reason is number (2) above this decision should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; changed.  Those at WWC who could benefit from such a newsgroup may</i><br>
<i>&gt; be the last to speak out against it being censored, so its up to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rest of us to defend their rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; -- Rick Behrens</i><br>
<i>&gt;    WWC alumnus</i><br>
<p>
   Agreed.  I believe the system does need to change.<br>
<p>
------------------------------<br>
<p>
   If any other WWC Alumni (or anyone else for that matter) want to voice<br>
your opinions on this subject, I'll compile your responses and see what I <br>
can do to get them to the committee.  Please do the following:<br>
<p>
SEND TO:  jash@eecs.wsu.edu<br>
<p>
KEEP IT SHORT:  A couple paragraphs &lt; 20 lines.  Summarize.<br>
<p>
SUBJECT:  Please put "TO_WWC" on the Subject line so I know it's not <br>
          regular SDAnet email.<br>
<p>
DISCUSS:  (just some ideas)<br>
<p>
  -- Do you think newsgroups should be removed?  Why or why not?<br>
  -- What principles do you think should govern which groups are removed?<br>
  -- What changes should be made to the list of suspended newsgroups?<br>
  -- Who should have a say in this?  Parents? Students? Alumni? Teachers? <br>
<p>
<p>
   Remember... a committee is gonna read what you write.  8-)   So make<br>
it convincing.  It might be helpful to back up what you say with sources.<br>

The church has fallen into a trap with regards to several conflicts between<br>
our principles and the ambient culture.  Kids are raised to believe <br>
"Good Adventists don't do ....." (play pro sports, grow up to be policemen,<br>
get involved in politics, you name it...)  The "doctor nurse preacher <br>
teacher dentist lawyer" set of careers was clearly defined in my day.<br>
<p>
Perhaps this stance ought not to have any credibility to start with.  But<br>
it rapidly loses whatever credibility it had when the SDA church lionizes<br>
its people who succeed in areas that we were always told "Good SDA's<br>
don't do."  Maybe this is just an extension of the "love the sinner,<br>
hate the <br>
sin" philosophy, but I think it is rather a publicity-starved church<br>
trying to play to a church full of people suffering from individual and <br>
collective inferiority complexes.  We crave vicarious fame. "Vicarious<br>
Famous Athlete" is our new beast.  <br>
<p>
This argument doesn't happen in the Mormon church anymore because <br>
Brigham Young's teams win too much for it to be an issue.  Give Columbia<br>
Union a few years and it may be the same situation.  All the hoopla <br>
raised over Samson Kisekka a few years ago (while carefully not mentioning<br>
that he came to power in a coup) is another example.  Likewise Andrews<br>
Univ. granting a doctorate to Daniel Arap Moi while his own people are rising<br>
in revolt against him for human rights violations.<br>
<p>
A few years ago a Seventh-day Adventist pitcher actually made the big-league<br>
team of the Texas Rangers, but was hurt early in the season before he <br>

others.  Once this happens, we can be sure the star-struck SDA church<br>
will be there as his groupies.<br>
<p>
By the way, if I remember correctly, Ellen White's comments about competitive<br>
sport and the roughness of it were based on seeing the performance at Battle<br>
Creek of a visiting Australian football team.  It seems some things never<br>
change.  <br>

<p>
To answer your concern about the prices of VEGE food one has to consider many <br>
variables. Often supermarkets like Schraders choose to take a very small <br>
profit on some items and larger profits on others. For example Scraders has an<br>
extensive (authentic) meat section. There primary market is not Adventists. <br>
Therefore they can afford to price the VEGE meat lower in order to add new <br>
customers. Once those customers are in the store they will buy other staple <br>
items such as fruits, fresh vegetables, and paper products. These other <br>
products could have a  higher profit margin. <br>
<p>
I'm sure that Schraders would be glad to underprice AV in order to get SDAs.<br>
On the other hand. AV's main market is SDAs. The VEGE food is their meat and <br>
potatoes. They cannot afford to sell these items at large discounts. There's <br>
no other products to assign the costs to. Also AV has committed itself to a <br>
large, diversified inventory. If Schrader concentrates on just a few hot <br>
sellers there storage and overhead costs will be less. <br>
<p>
Understand that even with the high prices, AV is not making a lot of money.<br>

<p>
I'm not sure that lawyer was on the traditional list.  However, the<br>
perceived slant toward the health, teaching, and ministerial fields is<br>
not as strong as it used to be.  Clearly, these professions afford some<br>
of the best opportunities to reach a large number of people, addressing<br>
their immediate needs.  They also include a great deal of self sacrifice <br>
and SERVICE to others (maybe not doctoring now, but that may change again).  <br>
If we really believe that we are to spread the word around the world quickly, <br>
then we should encourage (not demand) our youth into directions that <br>
would maximize their contact and influence among others.<br>
<p>
This does not mean that the SDA Church should be the church of doctors, <br>
teachers, and preachers only.  I certainly hope not, for I am only<br>
a lowly engineer!  We all, whatever our life work, should feel welcome<br>
in the church.  If we don't, I would say something is dreadfully wrong<br>
with our Church's spiritual health.  We all, if we are willing, can have<br>
a valuable place in the work.  Remember this, Jesus began His group <br>
not from the elite, but from a cross section of the common man of His day.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Do you really think that the members of the Church are publicity starved?<br>
If you are saying that for the good of the SDA Church that we encourage<br>
such activity so that we can get along to other things, I think we are<br>
in deep trouble, our focus being in the wrong place!!!<br>

Mark Fuller (acus10@waccvm.corp.mot.com) uploaded 6.00 to<br>
wuarchive (128.252.135.4) in /doc/bible/ibm-pc and keeps it fairly<br>
up-to-date.  Someone recently uploaded most if not all to simtel20<br>
(192.88.110.20), so it should also appear soon on simtel20 mirror sites.<br>
I recall a comment in 5.00 that a French version was forth-coming,<br>
but I've not heard more.  Mark would know since he has regular<br>
contact with Larry Price (Mr OLB).<br>
<p>
Someone mentioned in soc.religion.christian.bible-study a couple<br>
months back that the AV text provided is Webster's and differs<br>
slightly from the typical KJV.  Ring a bell with anybody?  I've<br>
been tripped up by specifying American vs British spellings a few<br>
times in searches.  The AV text is typically bundled with Darby's.<br>
I believe Darby was Plymouth Brethren, so perhaps he might render<br>
some texts to fit his eschatology (futurist, I think?).<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [From John Ash]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hi all,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Well, no longer is there uncensored reading of newsgroups at WWC.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Evidently the administration finally got wind of all the "evils" which were</i><br>
<i>&gt; available and made a quick &amp; decisive cut.  Here is the notice which was</i><br>
<i>&gt; posted:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; By order of C. Michael Bell and President Andreasen, the following</i><br>
<i>&gt; newsgroups </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   are no longer received on this campus.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.politics.homosexuality</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sex</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sex.bondage</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sex.motss</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sex.movies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sex.stories</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sexual.abuse.recovery</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sexual.abuse.recovery.d</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sex.fetish.feet</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sex.extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.sex.bestiality.barney</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; alt.satanism</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bit.listserv.gaynet</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rec.nude</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Any discussion of or disagreements with any of this list should be sent to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   C. Michael Bell (bellmi).  The president is forming a committee to</i><br>
<i>&gt; look into</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   the matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; P.S. The news administrator on this machine was not part of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; decision.  No</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   flames to ashted, please.</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (For your information, Michael Bell (bellmi@wwc.edu) is the head of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Campus Computer Center.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Just a few comments.  It's interesting to look at the above list and</i><br>
<i>&gt; attempt to understand the rationale behind the cuts.  For example, why did </i><br>
<i>&gt; they choose (apparently) to cut ALL groups having to do with SEX and/or </i><br>
<i>&gt; HOMOSEXUALITY, while leaving groups such as alt.tasteless.penis?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    Maybe that's what the committee is looking into...</i><br>

<i>&gt; KB7ONG  </i><br>
<i>&gt; [If they only knew how many they missed....  :-)  SCT]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
While I cannot tell John that he was wrong to have posted this to SDANet, I<br>
can say that I would have appreciated a little more thinking and discussion<br>
before he did.  I, personally, was not involved in the making of this decision,<br>
however, as news administrator, I was the one to implement the policy.  I know<br>
from talking with those who made the list that the choices shown above are <br>
neither long-thought-through, nor permanent.  The group neither includes all <br>
which will be cut, nor excludes all which will be left.  That, in particular, <br>
IS what the committee is looking into.  So, please, realize this before telling <br>
us just how wrong our current choices are (either inclusions or exclusions).  <br>

                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
<p>
This may open a can of worms but...<br>
<p>
Where do you get this directive?<br>
Yes, the Bible says "Thou shalt not kill" but I think a strong case can be made<br>
that the type of killing referred to was not an across-the-board no taking of<br>
life under any circumstances definition.  I believe that offensive,<br>
premeditated, killing is definitely included.  But what about self defense,<br>
defense of your spouse and family?  I am not saying that they are ok, only<br>
asking the question to generate some views.<br>
<p>
There are cases in the Bible where people were stoned for this and that...false<br>
prophets for example.  Peter carried a knife or sword...the equivalent of<br>
carrying a gun today.  Yet Christ never told him to take it off and get rid of<br>
it.  Why?  He did tell Peter to put it away (not to use it) when Peter cut off<br>
the guys ear in the garden.  but that was because what was prophesied had to<br>
happen (no intervention allowed).<br>
<p>
If I were to come home some evening to find my wife and/or kids harmed, raped,<br>
 and/or killed by somebody and that somebody was still there, I'd be hard<br>
pressed not to use a gun to stop them in thier tracks, especially given the<br>
rediculous justince system we have in our country (USA).<br>
<p>
Or what if you are awakened at night to a noise.  You check it out and you find<br>
someone attempting to violate your home (harm someone or your property) and they<br>
have a weapon and plan to use it to get what they want.  Do you let them harm<br>
you or your family?<br>
<p>
As head of our household, I don't think that the "turning the other cheek"<br>
applies here.  If my life is definately threatened and its clear that its their<br>
life or mine and one of us won't be alive afterward, is it ok then to take a<br>
life?<br>
<p>
For me, I can see giving up my life so that they can still have a chance at<br>
salvation, but in the case where they have hurt or taken the lives of those I am<br>
responsible for protection, I'd have a very hard time with.<br>
<p>
I don't think guns are to be used for threatening someone  (outside the home) or<br>
for implementing justice for others (other than your family).  But what about as<br>
a last resort, self (family) protection device?<br>
<p>
What do you all think?  I would appreciate Bible texts that do apply to these<br>
thoughts.<br>

Thanks everyone for your comments on church organs and so on.<br>
I have never heard the "our organ is an evangelistic tool"<br>
argument before, so that one was definitely worthwhile.<br>
<p>
My preference would be to attend a church without a pipe organ,<br>
and visit a church that does have one. (As it is I don't have<br>
a choice, there are none handy to visit.) I don't enjoy being<br>
in acoustically super-live environments with a crowd of people,<br>
and trying to listen to a sermon or something. Our church is <br>
difficult enough at times, and it has carpet on the floor and<br>
padding on the seats! (More comfort for the shakers? No, just<br>
acoustical engineering...)<br>
<p>
Interestingly, at our last church business meeting the topic of<br>
stewardship was discussed. Some of the church leaders are trying<br>
to raise money for a few projects, and wished to send a letter<br>
to every family in the church encouraging budgeted giving. It<br>
was voted not to mention the new-electronic-organ project in the<br>
letter, in order not to deter otherwise willing givers! It seems<br>
some in our church feel that the organ is loud enough and played<br>
enough already, and that to buy a new one would only encourage<br>
"louder and longer" playing!<br>
<p>
So there you go. In our case, I think we're fortunate that the<br>
donor piked out. So, all you people at Southern College, continue<br>
to enjoy your recitals, music schools and so on. I assume the<br>
College students enjoy it just as much as all the distinguished<br>
non-SDA guests??<br>

<i>&gt; The "doctor nurse preacher </i><br>

<p>
 From my experience, I might not state it quite as strongly; Andrews,<br>
after all, started up a trades/tech school around 1970.  However,<br>
I would agree that there has been and still is an attitude that<br>
people who work by the sweat of their brow and with their hands are<br>
somehow inferior to (at least less gifted than) "brain workers", which<br>
attitude I deplore.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; it rapidly loses whatever credibility it had when the SDA church lionizes its</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who succeed in areas that we were always told "Good SDA's don't do."</i><br>
<p>
A case of cognitive dissonance, indeed.  Perhaps it is the lionization which<br>
is sometimes unwise (wanting to be like the "other nations"? (1Sam 8:19,20)).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All the hoopla </i><br>
<i>&gt; raised over Samson Kisekka a few years ago (while carefully not mentioning</i><br>
<i>&gt; that he came to power in a coup) is another example.</i><br>
<p>
Is Delbert Baker available for comment?  My recall is that Dr Kisekka<br>
got in trouble with Idi Amin (not a nice guy!), that he worked with those<br>
trying to bring better government to Uganda.  After the fall of Amin,<br>
things were pretty chaotic for some time (almost all wildlife was butchered),<br>
so it seems somewhat difficult to call what happened next a "coup"<br>
(I may be fuzzy on the sequence of governments), nor have I perceived<br>
a cover-up of any kind as to his involvement (viz Delbert Baker's book).<br>
Moreover, Dr Kisekka was invited to become Prime Minister; I do not recall<br>
him actively seeking that position nor fomenting riot and rebellion or even<br>
politicking to achieve any position.<br>

<i>&gt; Whatever Judges 19:22 might be about, I can't believe that a homosexual</i><br>
<i>&gt; act between consenting partners is "worse" than the horrible scene depicted</i><br>
<i>&gt; in this verse. The fact that the man could treat his "virgin daughter" in</i><br>
<i>&gt; this way both astounds and disgusts me. Lets not allow our innate homophobia</i><br>
<i>&gt; obscure just how awful this "heterosexual" scene really is.</i><br>
<p>
The account of the sodomites in Gen 19 is similar. The Gay Pastor said that<br>
God was angry at the the people because of their violence and attempted rape<br>
of strangers, and not at their homosexual acts.  Actually, if you just take<br>
the few verses around there in total isolation, it is impossible to say for<br>
sure what in particular God didn't approve about their actions, but that is<br>
not how the bible should be studied. If you read the whole bible, you'll<br>
see that *all* of it was sinful: the violence, the attempt at violation of<br>
another's rights, and the sex perversion. Jude 1:7 makes it clear that their<br>
fornication was a sin.<br>
	As for the man offering them the women to abuse, that is indeed<br>
wrong, and depicts the ancient low estimate in which womanhood was held, but<br>
that does not change the fact that Sodomy is a sin too. In Lot's case, the<br>
angels thankfully prevented the plan going through, in the Levite case, the<br>
concubine was raped to death. That is certainly not viewed with favor with<br>
God.<br>

The White Truth was written by Elder John Robertson who was at the time of<br>
writing the pastor of the La Sierra church.  One might say that it was<br>
written as a response to the White Lie but actually started circulating<br>
before the White Lie!<br>

You ask an excellent question Sherman.  It's a question which leads, I think,<br>

Friends,<br>
<p>
Since some seem so eager to plug a book that has been so devisive and so<br>
hurtful of God's dear remnant people, might I take this opportunity to<br>
recommend that you read THE WHITE TRUTH by John J. Robertson (Mountain<br>
View, CA: Pacific Press, 1981).  ISBN 0-8163-0466-1.  I'd like to further<br>
suggest the first 5 chapters of SELECTED MESSAGES, BOOK ONE and the<br>
introduction to THE GREAT CONTROVERSY.<br>
<p>
"There will be a hatred kindled against the testimonies which is satanic. <br>
The workings of Satan will be to unsettle the faith of the churches in<br>
them, for this reason: Satan cannot have so clear a track to bring in his<br>
deceptions and bind up souls in his delusions if the warnings and reproofs<br>
and counsels of the Spirit of God are heeded."  (1 SM, p. 48).<br>

I hope to hear the Flentrop tracker here in Seattle soon.  Actually, I really<br>
enjoy the candidness of the Brumbaugh sound.  It's nice to have two<br>

(talking about competition and pipe organs is definitely a LOT less work).<br>
************************<br>
Let's back-up in the story a bit... : )<br>
<p>
Paul Virgo seems to be commenting on the "He that is without<br>
sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her" section of John 8:4-11.<br>
You seem to bring out the "go and sin no more" section.  Maybe the two<br>
are coexistent, and do NOT cancel the other.<br>
<p>
If this is the case, we are back to the point of "why do some Christians,<br>
hetero and homosexual, believe that condemnation against homosexual<br>
orientation, and further, committed homosexual relationships can NOT be<br>
supported from the Bible (read with all contextual background in tact)?"<br>
If "go and sin no more" and "He that is without sin..." *DO* cancel each other,<br>
then why?  Must they?<br>
<p>
I'd really like to hear many and diverse responses to this.<br>
<p>

Competition is a basic component in our day-to-day existence. Whether<br>
it be work or play, it seems that the measurement for success is who<br>
came in first. No one remembers the Braves finishing second, or the <br>
Bills going to three straight Super Bowls. It would be tragic to say<br>
that the Bulls are not a great team if they don't three-peat this<br>
year. That's how long our measuring stick has become.<br>
<p>
I like playing basketball. Making myself a better player drives me to<br>
challenge myself against others who may be better than I am. However,<br>
I try to remind myself that it's still only a game and to enjoy it<br>
as long as my body can stand it. I tell that to my teammates when<br>
we are losing badly and are frustrated to a point where tempers could<br>
flare.<br>
<p>
Competition, ideally, drives all of us to be better, as<br>
long as we're driving toward the same goal and if we're willing to<br>
help our competitors finish, if not in first place. But as long as the<br>
goal is "first place, whatever it takes," the carnage, physically<br>
and spiritually, will be strewn by the wayside. Trashtalk and Little<br>
League parents are good examples.<br>
<p>
I observed a game where the team leading the ballgame late started to<br>
showboat. That was classless, I thought. Then a player from the opposite<br>
team gave a hard foul. The benches cleared, the fans in the stands spilled<br>
onto the court, and all I wanted was to get out of the gym, lest some<br>
gangbanger with a itchy trigger finger wanted to unload his .357 into<br>
the crowd. The officials called the game, giving the win to my HS alma<br>
mater.<br>
<p>
Bottom line: it's a matter of an attitude adjustment toward Christ.<br>
Then we can put competition in its proper role and let cooperation<br>
take us farther along.<br>
<p>
And now, back to your regularly scheduled program, "Cheers." Oops,<br>
sorry. It's a rerun.<br>

Now the truth comes out...not only do we have much more violent sport here,<br>
Ellen White was EXILED here!! They never emphasized *that* aspect of her<br>
visit here when I sat prophetic guidance classes!<br>
<p>
No need to ask what Uncle Sam really thinks of us, I guess... or Uncle Steve<br>
for that matter!  :-)<br>
<p>
btw, speaking of geography, I'm really sorry to be so far away from that<br>
Spring Lecture series that was mentioned. I'll be interested to hear how<br>
they went, and about some of the points that are raised.<br>

Should we then recommend that all SDAs should get out and read Kellogs<br>

I'm reading Alden Thompson's book "Inspiration" right now, and it is quite<br>
refreshing.  It doesn't give all the answers to things but seems to point to<br>
a more balanced view of inspiration, and clarification of "revelation" versus<br>
"inspiration" and how they work.<br>
<p>
I highly recommend it, as my pastor did to me.<br>

In light of one of our current discussions, I saw a couple of<br>
interesting messages on another listserv which I'm forwarding as an<br>
interesting counterpoint.<br>

<i>&gt; From: Gary Phillips &lt;phillips@AUSTEN.NOTIS.COM&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject:      Re: Bible and Homosexuality</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A friend showed me an article titled The Bible and Homosexuality, by H.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Darrell Lance, in American Baptist Quarterly, vol. 8, 1989, pages 140-151,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which claims that the current issue of homosexuality is more a result of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; our interest than a reflection of biblical priorities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is not hell on wheels, but more in line with William Sloane Coffin's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thinking.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Terry, this is entirely correct. Not only is homosexuality a very tiny</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue in the bible, there are instances where gay relationships appear to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be accepted. Much of the furor over this issue among fundamentalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christians derives from mistranslation of a few specific verses. It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; a big deal with them because it has always been a "safe" position: who</i><br>
<i>&gt; would DARE contradict them on this one? Like the flurry of anti-gay</i><br>
<i>&gt; legislation we are seeing, this position arises because it is no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt; fashionable or acceptable to hate blacks or Jews or Russians. We have</i><br>
<i>&gt; become the safe target for bigotry and hatred.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't let anyone use Sodom and Gomorrah as an argument, the issue there</i><br>
<i>&gt; had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with hospitality toward</i><br>
<i>&gt; strangers. Likewise, the words used by Paul in his epistles that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually translated as "homosexual" or "effeminate" could just as easily</i><br>
<i>&gt; be translated as "coward" or "weakling." Quotes from Leviticus are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most worthless of all: unless the person relying on Leviticus is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to condemn wearing of mixed fiber garments, wet dreams, women who</i><br>
<i>&gt; wear red, and eating of shellfish or shrimp.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I come by these positions honorably: I have a degree in religious studies</i><br>
<i>&gt; and some additional seminary coursework. And I can read Greek, which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; often a claim that our detractors cannot make!</i><br>

In light of one of our current discussions, I saw a couple of<br>
interesting messages on another listserv which I'm forwarding as an<br>
interesting counterpoint.<br>

<i>&gt; Date:         Wed, 19 May 1993 09:05:20 CDT</i><br>
<i>&gt; From: Gary Phillips &lt;phillips@AUSTEN.NOTIS.COM&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject:      Re: Bible and Homosexuality</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A friend showed me an article titled The Bible and Homosexuality, by H.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Darrell Lance, in American Baptist Quarterly, vol. 8, 1989, pages 140-151,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which claims that the current issue of homosexuality is more a result of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; our interest than a reflection of biblical priorities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It is not hell on wheels, but more in line with William Sloane Coffin's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thinking.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Terry, this is entirely correct. Not only is homosexuality a very tiny</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue in the bible, there are instances where gay relationships appear to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be accepted. Much of the furor over this issue among fundamentalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christians derives from mistranslation of a few specific verses. It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; a big deal with them because it has always been a "safe" position: who</i><br>
<i>&gt; would DARE contradict them on this one? Like the flurry of anti-gay</i><br>
<i>&gt; legislation we are seeing, this position arises because it is no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt; fashionable or acceptable to hate blacks or Jews or Russians. We have</i><br>
<i>&gt; become the safe target for bigotry and hatred.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Don't let anyone use Sodom and Gomorrah as an argument, the issue there</i><br>
<i>&gt; had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with hospitality toward</i><br>
<i>&gt; strangers. Likewise, the words used by Paul in his epistles that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually translated as "homosexual" or "effeminate" could just as easily</i><br>
<i>&gt; be translated as "coward" or "weakling." Quotes from Leviticus are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most worthless of all: unless the person relying on Leviticus is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to condemn wearing of mixed fiber garments, wet dreams, women who</i><br>
<i>&gt; wear red, and eating of shellfish or shrimp.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I come by these positions honorably: I have a degree in religious studies</i><br>
<i>&gt; and some additional seminary coursework. And I can read Greek, which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; often a claim that our detractors cannot make!</i><br>

Here's another forwarded message.  HB<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Date:         Wed, 19 May 1993 07:29:20 -1000</i><br>
<i>&gt; From: Kevin Roddy &lt;KRODDY%UHUNIX.BITNET@VM.USC.EDU&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject:      Re: Bible and Homosexuality</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gary--</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I totally agree with your observations--Anyone who reads "undoctored"</i><br>
<i>&gt; versions of the bible in Aramaic and Hebrew will realize that it perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the most "spun" document on earth---Beginning with Genesis and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole adam and eve rib thing--there is no English translation for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hebrew word that biblical scholars have translated into English as "rib", and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the impression a reader of the original text would get is that adam alone</i><br>
<i>&gt; possessed both forms of genetalia and he/she was later split into a duality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Much of our world has been "translated" through discriminating eyes.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; would behoove those truly interested in what was originally written to</i><br>
<i>&gt; learn those ancient languages.  What an eye opener it was for me with</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hebrew!</i><br>

My third-party reply:<br>
  I consider the Word of God to be infallible. I don't subscribe to the <br>
infallibility of the  Pope. <br>
Likewise I don't subscribe to the infallibility of EGW. What major <br>
difference do you  perceive <br>
between the infallibility of the Pope and the infallibility of EGW (which I <br>
 assume is your position <br>
as one who places the writings of EGW on a par with the Word of  God)?<br>
  Actually my position is that: to date, I haven't read in the Spirit of <br>
Prophecy anything that  "I" <br>
consider a failure of truth. There is much more of the SOP that I haven't <br>
read, so in no  way am I <br>
even eligible to declare it infallible. In another respect, I could never <br>
account my  own wisdom <br>
sufficient to ascribe any writings outside of the Word of God as <br>
infallible.  My faith in the Word of <br>
God as infallible is just that, God given faith; followed by many  <br>
convincing evidences of accuracy <br>
and fidelity. I certainly don't possess the same for the  SOP, though I do <br>
not dispute the possibility <br>
of it in fact being perfect.<br>
  My conclusion: Faith in the Word of God is definitely imperative to <br>
believers. As  important and <br>
beneficial as the SOP is, EGW herself said that if we held to Bible truth <br>
and  understanding as we <br>
should, her writings would not have been necessary. She "herself"  placed <br>
her writings in what <br>
must be taken to be its proper place, a position below the Word of God. If <br>
that text of her  writings <br>
was as inspired as the rest of her writings (which would be  good <br>
assumption), then let's not forget <br>
that, and let's not attempt to influence others to believe anything to the <br>
contrary.   Every member of <br>
God's kingdom is led by the Spirit of God, let's go ahead and permit the  <br>
Spirit to convince each <br>
man's heart.<br>

<i>&gt;Do you really think that the members of the Church are publicity starved?</i><br>
Yes, there is a collective inferiority complex which leads us to put a <br>
very unhealthy emphasis on those few that get publicity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you are saying that for the good of the SDA Church that we encourage</i><br>
<i>&gt;such activity so that we can get along to other things, I think we are</i><br>
<i>&gt;in deep trouble, our focus being in the wrong place!!!</i><br>
<p>
God forbid!  Better to have a church that finds its true identity in God.<br>

 From Alvin Vitangcol<br>
<p>
As the name suggests, ASAR is a public forum on recovery from all types of<br>
sexual abuse, including rape experienced by adults as well as by children.  It<br>
is frequented by both males and females, and is accessible to everyone,<br>
including supporters, health care professionals, perpetrators, and the general<br>
public.  The cast of readers and authors changes constantly.  Recently<br>
discussed topics include self-inflicted violence, multiple personalities,<br>
confronting/naming perpetrators, dealing with the holidays, explaining oneself<br>
to prying members of the general public, self-defense, nightmares, etc.<br>
<p>
I just took a quick look at alt.sexual.abuse.recovery.  It seems to<br>
follow the fate of several of the alt newsgroups.  It IS a support<br>
group, but it tends to shoot off into the bizzare.  Plus, a lot of the<br>
posts seemed like they were more interested in flaming people than<br>
actually discussing.  One other thing is that the posters appear to be<br>
more interested in finding out exactly what happened, but are less<br>
interested in actually discussing the topic.<br>

I think a key factor in eliminating this newsgroup though, comes from<br>
the following section of the FAQ:<br>
<p>
Judgements of sexual behavior should not be made.  ASAR readers run the gamut<br>
from heterosexual to homosexual and everything in between.  No matter what your<br>
orientation is, you have as much right as anyone to participate in ASAR, and as<br>
little right to criticize someone else's sexuality as you would give to them.<br>
<p>
***********************<br>
<p>
I think the preceding statement does justify the canceling of this<br>
newsgroup, in that WWC is trying to get rid of newsgroups which<br>
contradict the beliefs of SDA's.<br>
<p>
I wrote a message several weeks ago on what I thought about the<br>
newsgroup situation, but after talking to several people, it doesn't<br>
seem to have been posted.  Can anyone tell me if they saw it, or else if<br>
not, I'll post it again?<br>

[I might have sent out twice the post to which Dan is replying,<br>

<p>
Yes, I realize that this type of thing is done many places and that it<br>
is probably done in this situation.  What amazes me is that in the<br>
"vege-meat" market and in our book market it appears that we charge<br>
quite a bit more than what the "normal" market would bear.  And that if<br>
we would enlarge our market and distribution systems we would be able to<br>
increase our volume, decrease our prices, and probably earn more<br>
overall.  It continually amazes me when I go into other Christian book<br>
stores and then compare those prices with the prices of ABC's.  I have<br>
long thought that we (SDA book publishers) should make our books<br>
available in the wider Christian bookstore market, and that we could<br>
then increase volume and decrease prices... and reach many more people!<br>

Dear Steve and fellow SDAnetters,<br>
<p>
	the university will close down my computer accounts at the end of<br>
this month, therefore, please cease sending any email to med10014 by<br>
Thursday this week. (In fact, don't send anything to me at this address<br>
after this month, as it will be reassigned to somebody else)<br>
<p>
	I will try to reapply for a new email account in July and then<br>
notify you of my new email address. In the meantime, could you please<br>
redirect any email you want to send me to both of these two addresses?<br>
<p>
Care of my friend Caleb at:<br>
			    be7116503@ntuvax.ntu.ac.sg<br>
<p>
and to me at the Asylum BBS at:<br>
				Beng.Tang@f622.n600.z6.fidonet.org<br>
<p>
	The reason i ask you to duplicate mail to me is that the BBS is<br>
prone to go offline without warning due to system problems, and my friend<br>
Caleb may soon be expelled from his university, because he is likly to fail<br>
his exams because one of his papers falls on Sabbath 5th June, and so he<br>
will not sit it. Therefore, both addresses are not certain to be online all<br>
the time.<br>

<i>&gt; Should we then recommend that all SDAs should get out and read Kellogs</i><br>
<i>&gt; book "The living Sanctuary". Was EGW wrong in attempting to prohibit</i><br>
<i>&gt; its publication ?</i><br>
<p>
It was right for Ellen White to counsel against the publication of Kellogg's<br>
book _by_the_Review_&amp;_Herald_.  As I recall my church history, Kellogg's book<br>
was the last of many publications that R&amp;H accepted that were not in harmony<br>
with SDA doctrine.  (It actually wasn't printed; the plant burned down after<br>
the type was set but before the printing run--in a fire attributed to divine<br>
origin.)<br>
<p>
There is a big difference between attempting to prohibit the publication<br>
_at_all_ of a book, and prohibiting the publication _by_the_church_press_ of a<br>
book.  By church officials, the latter is good and proper, the former is<br>
wrong.  (Readers at Andrews: I interpret much of the biennial controversy over<br>
the Student Movement April 1st edition as a similar question of editorial<br>
control.  Is the SM ultimately being published by Andrews University, or by<br>
the Andrews University Student Association?)<br>
<p>
I must agree with Harvey Brenneise: to attack a book or other publication<br>
without at least starting to read it yourself puts you in a postition where<br>
you're merely repeating the prejudices and biases of others.  (Forgive me if I<br>
misunderstand your position....)  On the other hand, we need not recommend<br>
that "all SDAs" "get and read Kellogg's book" because not "all SDAs" have an<br>
interest in that time and place in church history.<br>
<p>
If you don't want to read a book because of what other people say about it,<br>
that's fine.  Freedom of choice in reading material includes freedom _not_ to<br>
have to read something.  But if you feel the need to condemn or praise a book,<br>
understand and communicate that your condemnation or praise is not based on<br>
personal knowledge, but on the understanding of somebody else.<br>

The 22 May 1993 issue of Insight has an interesting story about the use of<br>
guns in personal protection vs. depending on the angelic host for protection.<br>
In general, Insight is an excellent publication, but this time an article is<br>
especially relevant to this discussion.<br>

I have had to endure such an experience.  During my undergrad days at<br>
the University of the West Indies (St. Augustine, Trinidad), I failed<br>
several exams because I did not attend the biology labs and/or classes<br>
which were held on Sabbath.  Fortunately for me, I succeeded in<br>
obtaining my BS or BSc (Botany/Applied Botany) after repeating them<br>
over several years when they were not scheduled on Sabbath.  Let<br>
us in SDAnet link our hands in prayer, on Caleb's behalf.  God does<br>
still work miracles.  I know.<br>

Hello SDAnetters:<br>
<p>
What is it with the American obsession with guns?  Did any of you see<br>
the Nightline program last week, where Ted interviewed some folk on<br>
this subject?  If I am not mistaken, the statistics indicate that in<br>
the USA, tens of thousands of people die every year as a result of<br>
hand gun violence, whereas in Canada, Japan and Britain, less than<br>
70, (yes 7-0-) die a year.  Yet most Americans can see nothing<br>
unusual or catastrophic about those figures.<br>
<p>
The focus was based on the Japanese boy who was shot to death in<br>
Lousiana last year on Halloween night after knocking on a door to get<br>
instructions on how to find a Halloween party to which he was going.<br>
And the Lt. Gov of Louisiana sits with a straight face and suggests<br>
that this was an isolated incident.  Is human life worth so little to<br>
us that we argue about our right to bear arms?  In fact despite the<br>
ugly TV news, many more die at the hands of relatives or friends or<br>
by accident than by the drive-by shootings and violent crime we often<br>
use as an excuse for our need to protect ourselves.<br>
<p>
Maybe there is something else that I don't  understand being an<br>
immigrant of only 12 years.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; &gt; I cannot agree with those who argue for ignorance of important books</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that examine or even challenge traditional understandings.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Should we then recommend that all SDAs should get out and read Kellogs</i><br>
<i>&gt; book "The living Sanctuary". Was EGW wrong in attempting to prohibit</i><br>
<i>&gt; its publication ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ruben.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I really don't see that much connection between the two cases.  In any<br>
case, there's only one Book that I would recommend that ALL SDAs should<br>
read.  The controversy over "The Living Temple" was more a political<br>
power struggle in the church (viz. between the preachers/church leaders<br>
and the medical work, specifically Kellogg) than it was over theology.<br>
I have not read the book, but historians report that the charges of<br>
pantheism were overplayed.  It is hardly controversial today, and would<br>
be of interest to those who wish to understand the history of the church<br>
(as is "The White Lie").  Kellogg also wrote a very popular book about<br>
sex (actually several books that went through many editions--some of the<br>
titles are "Man, the Masterpiece," "Plain Facts About Sexual Life," and<br>
"Plain Facts for Old and Young").  Reading these might be helpful in<br>
understanding the mileau in which Ellen White wrote on similar topics.<br>
(Incidentally, Kellogg also seemed obsessed with colon hygiene, which I<br>
undertand is prominent in Boyle's new novel about Battle Creek).  It is<br>
also interesting that Ellen White condemned the writings of Thomas<br>
Paine, the reading of which is essential now for historians of the<br>
Revolutionary period (both in the US and France).<br>

At the risk of being considered uncultured by the purists, have you<br>
considered a synthesizer instead of an organ for your church, Steve?<br>
I know, I know, they aren't aesthetically pleasing to look at and they<br>
don't have all those wonderful pipes to put up front as a semi-shrine,<br>
but they are MUCH more versatile, at least according to my source.  My<br>
source is an organ professor here at Morehead State, who joined our<br>
church last year and moved in his Yamaha Electone and now provides us<br>
with the most beautiful music on Sabbaths!  In the hands of someone who<br>
knows what he or she is doing, that thing is really something -- as you<br>
see, words fail me to describe it...  While not being cheap, it is<br>
certainly much cheaper than a custom built tracker organ, or even an<br>
electronic organ.  You might be able to semi-satisfy both camps.<br>

[I wouldn't mind at all but I think our current worship style doesn't <br>
lend itself well to that.  And as for Elmhurst SDA, no one is suggesting<br>
a tracker.  We have neither the money nor the right space.  SCT]<br>

The discussion on homosexuality in the Bible on SDAnet created a minor<br>
and rather amusing problem for me the other day. I wanted to demonstrate<br>
to my students doing the subject Operating Systems and Networks,<br>
the joys of email. Imagine their delight when they saw the well labelled<br>
SDAnet mail addressed to me on Female Homosexuality. Never mind<br>
excluding sex oriented news groups. I am sure the CBs of Australia<br>
would have a field day with SDAnet headers if they ever saw a list.<br>
<p>
I grew up on a farm where we kept a few hundered sheep. One of my<br>
jobs was to separate lambs from their tails, and if male, the scrotal<br>
sack as well. This job was carried out on balmy spring days in the<br>
beautiful green hills of North New Zealand. I remember once catching<br>
a lamb to perform this operation and finding that it had both male<br>
and female parts. In my youth this did not astound me greatly. I<br>
had seen preserved specimens of two headed calves at the local vets.<br>
<p>
If something can go wrong with the development of a new animal to the<br>
extent that it is born a hermaphrodite, then surely some of the<br>
brain chemistry can go wrong to the extent that someone is born<br>
homosexually oriented. Such people face identity problems through<br>
the whole of their lives and deserve our support and understanding.<br>
<p>
What I am concerned about is the evangelical zeal which some use to<br>
promote homosexuality as a way of life. When homosexuality becomes an<br>
excuse for selfish gratification, then it becomes wrong. In that sense<br>
it is just as wrong as someone who uses marriage as an excuse for<br>
selfish gratification.<br>
<p>
The condemnation of homosexuality which is given in the Bible is often<br>
given in the context of a number of other sins. I see no condemnation<br>
for homosexual orientation, or for people who suffer from birth defects.<br>
My problem is that I cannot tell the difference between those who have<br>
been born with the problem, and those who are doing it by considered<br>
choice.<br>
<p>
I do not know the answers. God asks us to love one another and that<br>
includes sinners, physically and mentally impaired, and even Australians.<br>

[Our list was banned from all Fermilab computers two years back because<br>
somebody did a global search on the word "pornography" and we happened <br>
to be discussing it that week.  At that time I stored all the archives<br>
