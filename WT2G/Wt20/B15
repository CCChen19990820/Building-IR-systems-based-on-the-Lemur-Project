This is the fourth start of this note.  Usually I try to make my messages<br>
clear, structured, and coherent.  But I have a strong emotional reaction to<br>
the question of Adventist education that's difficult to completely spell out<br>
in a concise, rational framework.<br>
<p>
Personal history: I started grade school in the Glen Park Seventh-day<br>
Adventist Church School in Gary/Hobart Indiana.  Grades 2-4 were spent there.<br>
In fourth grade my family moved to Dillingham, Alaska, where my father (hi,<br>
Dad! [he's here on the net too]) took on the role of mission pilot/pastor in<br>
Dillingham and for believers in a, what, 200 mile radius?  I spent fourth<br>
through eighth grade in the Dillingham Seventh-day Adventist Church School.<br>
Grade 9 was from Home Study International, with one class a day (Advanced<br>
Computer Literacy) in the Dillingham High School (well financed and equipped<br>
from Prudhoe Bay oil revenues--this was the '82-'83 school year.)  In 1983 my<br>
family moved to Ketchikan, Alaska, and I moved to Spangle, Washington--Upper<br>
Columbia Academy.  When I graduated in 1986 from UCA, my parents were in<br>
Michigan, so I attended Andrews University from 1987 to 1991 (except for<br>
Winter and Spring quarters 1990 which were spent at Argonne National<br>
Laboratory near Chicago, my current employer) graduating with a Bachelor of<br>
Science in Computer Science.<br>
<p>
Stream of consciousness follows:<br>
<p>
Gary/Hobart: first real experience dealing with kids my own age on a<br>
day-to-day basis.  Learned to take responsibility feeding the fish.  :)<br>
<p>
Dillingham grade school: Totally new environment and set of people to know.<br>
Not particularly pleasant.  Lets just say that I was not a typical Alaskan at<br>
the time, with weird interests in science, computers, and electricity.  In<br>
eighth grade, however, a new teacher came to town: Jim Beirle.  He enjoyed<br>
math and science and knew what a computer was, and really encouraged me that<br>
I was O.K.  8th grade was great.<br>
<p>
9th grade &amp; high school: Mostly boring.  Home study takes time, and its hard<br>
to self-motivate.  I much preferred the computer lab over in the high school,<br>
and had a lot of fun playing with the Apple IIs.  (One of the Apples was<br>
serial number 634.)  Gained the respect of the wrestling team captain and the<br>
senior class valedictorian, both of which happened to be taking the class with<br>
me.  For my part, I learned that non-Adventists could be nice, honest people<br>
too.<br>
<p>
Upper Columbia Academy: Totally new environment and set of people to know.<br>
This (as opposed to Dillingham) was much better.  I was able to make friends<br>
and carve out a social niche for myself.  For you Broadview, Wisconsin,<br>
Adelphian, Indiana, and other Midwest school alumini: they let the boys walk<br>
and girls alternate days to walk to town, alone, unescorted.  I had problems<br>
with the rules there too, but until nearly the end of my senior year didn't<br>
have any real run-ins with the disciplinary side of the administration.  (I<br>
really did deserve any discipline I received for that incident--and this note<br>
doesn't say what it was.)<br>
<p>
Andrews: Excellent education.  Because the department was small, classes were<br>
generally taught by professors.  I worked for teachers.  I got to know them.<br>
They treated me like a person, able to take responsibility and to have<br>
credible ideas.  I like to think that I, as a student, was given the<br>
opportunity to help shape their existing computing infrastructure--internal<br>
and external networking, etc.  This is the kind of education you simply don't<br>
get at public universities until the graduate level or later.  Kudos to the<br>
Computer Science Department at Andrews.  Way To Go.  Keep It Up!<br>
<p>
I brought up the "walk to town" bit above for a reason.  While at Andrews, an<br>
acquaintance went to Thunderbird Academy in Arizona to act as an assistant<br>
dean.  He came back, literally shaking his head at the insolence, disrespect,<br>
and worldliness of the students there.  Saving his point best point to last,<br>
he told his (shocked, nearly disbelieving) friends who had also attended<br>
Midwest academies "they even let the students WALK TO TOWN ALONE!"<br>
<p>
Except for my (now) wife and I sitting at the table, he convinced everyone.<br>
At UCA, TracyAnne and I regularly (on separate days) walked into town to buy<br>
corn chips and soda pop, and sometimes play video games in the little mom &amp;<br>
pop store.  Fun times.  I had a checking account at the Bank of Fairfield in<br>
Spangle.  For a while I even had a post office box at the US Post Office.<br>
Never did get up the nerve to order Playboy, though.  :) :) :) But isn't that<br>
sort of the point?<br>
<p>
I remember clearly a wise observation I overheard my father share.  In<br>
Dillingham, Alaska, 13, 14, 15, 16 year old kids run million-dollar fishing<br>
boats while the other crewmembers sleep.  They are paid and learn to<br>
handle/mishandle thousands of dollars of their own money.  (No exagguration: I<br>
worked three days on a fishing boat my 7-8th grade summer.  I made $1,247.33.<br>
After paying the $800 or so for my 8th grade school year, I still had $300 or<br>
so to spend.  And remember, I was working, by then, 10-20 hours a week at<br>
$4-$7/hour in the local public library.  I earned my &gt;$1000 entrance fee to<br>
UCA fair and square working, in about a month.)  When they go to an Adventist<br>
academy, they end up working on the grounds crew, with an old, authoritarian<br>
brother telling them in excruciating detail exactly how to mix the gas for the<br>
lawnmower, and warning them over and over of the dangers of electric shock<br>
from the spark plug.  Any wonder why many kids develop "bad attitudes"?<br>
<p>
I went to a boarding academy 1500-2500 miles from my parents.  When leaves<br>
came, I stayed at the academy or went home with friends.  During leave, when I<br>
spent time on campus, the rules changed.  Stay in the gym or up at the ball<br>
field until 7:30, then in the dorm until 6 in the morning?  No way!  6 inches<br>
from girlfriend or social (no contact: verbal, written, direct or indirect<br>
with girlfriend for prescribed period of time)?  Ha!  We were sitting on the<br>
lawn at 10:30 one night, enjoying the clear evening, and waved to the girls'<br>
dean as she walked by with her dog.  No Problem.<br>
<p>
I have this notion that if you work/study hard, behave yourself, act<br>
intelligently and responsibly, and do your best to be a likable person, you<br>
should be respected and trusted.  At UCA (during the school sessions,) and<br>
from the aspect of those who run the residence halls and other student<br>
services at Andrews, this is utterly and completely false.  TRADITIONAL<br>
ADVENTIST EDUCATION "KNOWS" WHAT IS BEST FOR THE STUDENTS, WHO CANNOT EVER BE<br>
TRUSTED TO KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR THEMSELVES.  AND, OF COURSE, SINCE WE (THE<br>
OUTNUMBERED AND UNDERSTAFFED ADMINISTRATORS) MUST CONTROL THEIR BEHAVIOR,<br>
NEEDS OF STUDENTS FOR SELF-DETERMINATION AND SELF-RESPONSIBILITY MUST<br>
NECESSARILY TAKE A LOW PRIORITY.  Until, in college, you reach the age of 22,<br>
or get married, whichever is first.  I have tried to reason with Andrews<br>
dormitory and Student Affairs personnel, and at times Campus safety, with<br>
generally dismal results.<br>
<p>
For example: in 1988 I suggested, personally and verbally, to Dean Knight or<br>
Dean Murray that dormitory worship services be held at an accessible time in<br>
the Andrews Science Complex, sometime around 6:30 or 7:30 in the evening.  I<br>
repeated this suggestion personally and verbally to Newton Hoilette when he<br>
first arrived and met with students in the cafeteria.  He had heard of the<br>
idea, but it just never was important enough to matter.  When my wife<br>
graduated in 1992 it had still not been acted upon.  <br>
<p>
For any Andrews faculty member reading this, I offer this challenge: pick a<br>
week in February.  Every night that week, start at the science complex and<br>
walk to the mens' dorm--I'll make it easy: Meier--and join any of the hall<br>
worships at 7:00 or deans worship at 7:00 on Thursday.  Then walk back to the<br>
science complex and teach your 7:30 class.  You can't drive your car, because<br>
parking around the dorms is reserved for residence hall residents, and it is<br>
the only place on campus they can legally park.<br>
<p>
Who is Adventist education for?  I hope the answer to that is the students.<br>
<p>
Working with IBM over the past year has been an amazing education in how hard<br>
they will work to make "the customer" happy.  If you ever work with IBM, at<br>
least their Scientific Supercomputing groups or their Federal Systems Company,<br>
the most powerful thing you can tell your IBM rep to say is that something is<br>
"unacceptable to the customer."  If you hear of an internal IBM discussion<br>
about whether or not to do something for you--and you don't particularly need<br>
or want it, you say that "this customer is completely satisfied with the<br>
current situation, and would find &lt;whatever&gt; unnecessary, and probably<br>
unacceptable."  As a relatively low-level representative of the customer, it<br>
takes someone pretty high up in the management ranks of IBM to overrule me.<br>
(Or, at least that's the impression they've successfully left!  :)<br>
<p>
So must Adventist education be.  Adventist education was originally started to<br>
meet the needs and desires of Seventh-day Adventist Christian families who<br>
wanted to have their children brought up in an environment compatible with<br>
their beliefs on doctrine and lifestyle.  So be it.  But at least this<br>
"customer" has gone away from Adventist education (along with an excellent<br>
technical education and fond memories of many other teachers and students) a<br>
deep-seated bitterness over my treatement at the hands and rules of Adventist<br>
educational establishment.<br>
<p>
Until Adventist education can shed its image of hassling students over<br>
seemingly trivial rules that nobody (not even those enforcing them) really<br>
believe in, and start treating the students as people worthy of respect and<br>
potential (not guaranteed or able-to-be-forced) souls for the Kingdom,<br>
enrollment will continue to decline.<br>
<p>
I was told once by a college residence hall dean: "Look, Bill: most of these<br>
rules are there so we can enforce them if we need to.  Part of life in any<br>
large organization is learning what rules are important and which are not."<br>
He was defending the existing rules by saying they weren't generally relevant<br>
and were capriciously enforced!  The curfew checks and so forth are supposedly<br>
"because we worry about you if you're not here" but have the civil authorities<br>
ever been alerted that so-and-so isn't back in the dorm yet, it's a<br>
blizzard/tornado/hurricane out there, and we're worried?  But after the fourth<br>
false fire alarm in a night, they won't give you a pass to go for a walk<br>
outside at 3:00AM on a clear warm spring night to relax.  Not policy....<br>
<p>
Andrews Advertisers: if you want a glowing recommendation of the Andrews<br>
University Computer Science Department, refer people to me.  You'll be hard<br>
pressed to find a more positive yet honestly believed endorsement.  <br>
<p>
However, while the parent is still on the phone or reading my electronic mail<br>
response I will tell the parents to rent/buy a house, apartment or trailer<br>
near Berrien Springs, call it the/a family residence, and claim that the<br>
student is living at home and doesn't need a meal plan or a dorm room.  That<br>
way they can enjoy the benefits of an Adventist education, friends, and social<br>
environment without the tyrannical oppression of people "who know what's best<br>
for them."  (I can offer hints for maintaining the illusion to the right<br>
people, too.  Michigan Bell sells Call Forwarding pretty cheap.  Who knows<br>
where (616) 473-pqrs might actully ring?)<br>
<p>
Sorry for the length and the rambling, but that's what SDAnet is for.  Right,<br>
Steve?  :)<br>
<p>
Thanks for your patience, and I really do wish the best for Adventist<br>
education.<br>

<i>&gt; A topic:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do the "Right to Life" people almost never speak up about</i><br>
<i>&gt; drunk driving (causes tens of thousands of deaths per year), war,</i><br>
<i>&gt; capital punishment and other needless loss of life?</i><br>
 <br>
Why does the Sierra Club not speak up on the First Amendment, or<br>
gun rights, or ...<br>
 <br>
The "Right to Life" descriptor isn't a very good one in that it<br>
uses a phrase with a very wide potential set of meanings to label<br>
a movement that is focused on a single question.<br>
 <br>
Don't you know anyone who belongs to more than one organization?<br>
A person may be interested in more than one thing, and trying to<br>
get any given organization to address *all* the potential interests<br>
of its members will result in one that is so diluted as to be of<br>
no interest to anyone.<br>
 <br>
Or do you think that the NRA is wrong to not address the problem<br>
of third-world hunger, to make an extreme example?  (I know an NRA<br>
member who also belongs to the Sierra Club and the ACLU, among other<br>
things.  She's interested in the various foci of these organizations,<br>
so she gives each some of her time and financial support.)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; What is their real issue?</i><br>
 <br>
Maybe opposing abortion is the only issue that some members of the<br>
above-mentioned movement are interested in.  Most of them have more<br>
interests than that one, but I suspect that they address them in<br>
other fora.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; They don't seem very loving or concerned with the quality of life.</i><br>
 <br>
Odd.  Some of those that you seem to be talking about that *I* know<br>
I'd describe in completely different terms...some others I'd be afraid<br>
to let into my neighborhood.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; They have even taken life from time to time in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the form of bombings and burnings.</i><br>
 <br>
Would you say that those in the 1970's anti-war movement who bombed<br>
computer centers and so on were typical of the entire population of<br>
the anti-war movement?<br>
 <br>
Any group who feel strongly about some subject will include extremists<br>
of one type or another.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Where are they really comming from?</i><br>
 <br>
Foes of abortion or just the extremists?<br>
 <br>
Personally, I've almost given up with either side to point of wishing<br>
a pox on both their houses.  Not because of the "average" member of<br>
either side, but from having to deal with extremists of either side.<br>

In a letter to all N. American SDA churches, (it was read in mine this<br>
past Sabbath), A. C. McClure called for a special day of prayer with<br>
regard to issues of religious liberty and issues of church and state. <br>
While not taking any stand on any particular court decision, it referred<br>
to "recent troubling decisions of the Supreme Court."<br>
<p>
Was this letter read from the pulpit elsewhere in other SDA churches? <br>
Was there any response to it?<br>

In our case, the letter was followed by a message from a guest speaker,<br>
preaching on Judges 17 and 18, which had five different sides and none<br>
of them were right, stressing the point that right and left is not the<br>
same <br>
as right and wrong.<br>

<i>&gt; Henry Pearl, the reviewer, claims (and rightly so) that Wyatt has</i><br>
<i>&gt; misunderstood the geomagnetic field reversal data to mean actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; flipping over of the earth, confusing celestial poles with magnetic poles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I find it distressing that there are those who go off half-cocked</i><br>
<i>&gt; claiming this or that piece of evidence proves the flood when in fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; they don't understand such a piece of evidence.  On the other hand, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; not wise to attribute to deceit what can be explained by stupidity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If anyone has further information on his track record, let me know.</i><br>
<p>
About 2 years ago, a supporter of Wyatt's showed a videotape of Wyatt's<br>
work to a rather large crowd in Gladstone, OR.  Mostly how he found what<br>
he did, vignettes on other folks' searches, and whether what he had found<br>
was really Noah's ark (he believes so).  There were some interviews with<br>
SDA geologists/paleontologists (whatever those guys are) voicing their<br>
opinions.  The trend seemed to be supportive in the clips; however the<br>
supporter showing the tape acknowledged that his conversations with some<br>
of those interviewed yielded pretty neutral to somewhat skeptical opinions.<br>
<p>
Discussion afterwards was nuked by some strange character repeatedly raising<br>
spurious objections, such as: "What sort of strange doctrine are you trying<br>
to introduce into the church?  You're wanting us to sacrifice goats!"  What<br>
actually happened was that the video opened with a scene where Turkish folk<br>
are getting ready to build a tourist center at Wyatt's find and the opening<br>
festivities involve killing a goat.  The voice-over was quite clear as to<br>
what was happening.  It was the individual who mistook this and many others.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SDA physicists are still doing damage control in the wake of Bob Gentry.</i><br>
<p>
Can you explain further?  I recall George Vandeman talking about Gentry's<br>
work maybe 20, 21 years ago.  I don't remember details nor what became<br>
of Gentry's ideas.  Remember that he wouldn't be the first to have an idea<br>
and then have it go down the drain.  Note how the State of Utah is spending<br>
big bucks on this cold fusion stuff.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What next?</i><br>
<p>
Wyatt is not the first.  Check out the French guy, Navarra.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are there any studies that show SDA's to be more gullible than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; average population?</i><br>
<p>
Careful; you're looking at a very narrow slice of human behavior.  Note<br>
that this aspect of credulity is not limited to SDAs.  Take eschatology for<br>
example.  Consider Hal Lindsay's early works and the great following that that<br>
engendered!  Folk are still reading his stuff and hoping, despite the abject<br>
failure of his earlier predictions.<br>

View Magazine is a new magazine designed for Seventh-day Adventists ages<br>
20-30, featuring articles and features by us and about us.  It will be a<br>
monthly, in the format of an 8-page broadside on newsprint, printed in<br>
2-color.  Subscriptions are available from the Review + Herald (address<br>
on request).<br>
 <br>
As a member of a focus group, I was able to review the preview issue of<br>
this magazine, and found it quite interesting.<br>

My sysadmins at Carnegie Mellon refuse to create alt newsgroups<br>
such as alt.sdanet for anyone.  So it appears it will be a while before <br>
such a thing will ever happen.  It's probably just as well.<br>

Glen McCluskey asks some questions about Enoch.  First, Mary was dogmaed<br>
into heaven in 1954 by the Catholics, but I've not heard of anyone else<br>
going to heaven recently.<br>
<p>
The more important question was, essentially, "does walking with God<br>
as Enoch did require that you be a hermit?"  I would argue the opposite.<br>
Though it has been a while since I read the particular section of<br>
Patriarchs and Prophets, I recall that in his day Enoch was known as a<br>
prophet, and was <br>
well known to the people of his day.  He did not shun contact, but<br>
thrived from it.  However, he did have a place of retreat where he could<br>
be alone with God.<br>
<p>
We find the same behavior exhibited by Christ:  Close and frequent<br>
contact with people, broken by long times of solitary prayer and<br>
meditation.<br>
I would not say it is impossible to be a Christian whilst locked up in<br>
your closet, but such a position makes it more difficult to love your<br>
fellow man.<br>

</ul>
<!-- body="start" -->
Some history for new members:<br>
SDA-L was created in late 1990 as a list for fellowship among SDA<br>
students and faculty, particularly those at secular universities.  In<br>
early 1991 it was discovered by the moderator of SDAnet (that's me,<br>
Steve Timm), who immediately proposed a two-way cross-distribution of<br>
messages between the two lists.  This led to record traffic on both<br>
lists.<br>
 <br>
Few people were happy with the arrangement, SDA-L people because they<br>
didn't want so much traffic or such controversial topics, SDAnet people<br>
because<br>
the cross-link defeated the moderation of the list.  So it was agreed that<br>
the SDAnet side would stop sending messages to SDA-L.  SDAnet was to be<br>
the place for controversial topics and inquiries from non-SDA's, while<br>
SDA-L would retreat to topics of fellowship and survival in the<br>
university world.<br>
Also the SDA-L echo to SDAnet would continue.  At this time several of<br>
the big mouths on SDA-L signed up to SDAnet and started directing their<br>
posts there, and traffic on SDA-L dropped essentially to zero, where it<br>
has stayed ever since.<br>
 <br>
So now the question is, what else is there that's discussable on SDA-L<br>
 <br>
1)  If you like the low traffic the way it is, don't say anything.<br>
2)  Otherwise, post on a topic of your choice, and we'll see how it works.<br>
 <br>
 From my experience with being the moderator of SDAnet, I have found that<br>
traffic only keeps going if every once in a while someone takes a real<br>
effort to liven it up.  I'm not prepared to be the provocateur on SDA-L<br>
as well.  I think what we need is a collective of several people who<br>
take responsibility for content of the list, and by this I mean, generate<br>
some content.  The listowners have enough trouble maintaining the mechanics<br>
of the list.<br>
 <br>
Jerome Grimmer is researching whether or not we can have a library of files<br>
available for people to get.  This important service is something SDAnet<br>
can't provide.  We need more people, particularly people who are going<br>
to be in the same place for a few years, to guarantee the stability of<br>
the content of the list.  Like Christine, Jerome and I are students and<br>
will eventually have to move on. (Although I can't imagine working at a<br>
place without net access).  If you see a niche you can fill, please<br>
speak up.  If nobody responds, we'll assume everyone likes the low SDA-L<br>
traffic and we don't have a problem.<br>

A topic:<br>
 <br>
Why do the "Right to Life" people almost never speak up about<br>
drunk driving (causes tens of thousands of deaths per year), war,<br>
capital punishment and other needless loss of life?  What is their<br>
real issue?  They don't seem very loving or concerned with the<br>
quality of life.  They have even taken life from time to time in<br>
the form of bombings and burnings.  Where are they really comming from?<br>

(I fully expected school choice to get more response than the Holy Spirit.<br>
But I'm not giving up.  I'll continue to post about the Holy Spirit as long <br>
as I keep learning something, and I encourage others to do the same.)<br>

One of the functions of the Holy Spirit is to reprove for sin. (John 16:8,9).<br>
We become convinced of the wrongness of a deed as the Holy Spirit speaks<br>
to our conscience (and here I include the ministry of the Spirit through<br>
the <br>
word of God.)  This knowledge leads to a repentance and a turning away<br>
from sin.<br>
<p>
Yet I fear that sometimes this understanding of the Holy Spirit can be<br>
misused.  Often you hear somebody say "The Holy Spirit hasn't told me<br>
this is important as yet," often with regard to the Sabbath.  In some<br>
cases the person is absolutely sincere in this.  Others seem like<br>
blatant ignorance or abuse of the principle.  <br>
<p>
How should these circumstances be handled?  Is the Holy Spirit a license<br>
to do as we please?<br>

Hi Steve,<br>
<p>
Can you please outline the general Adventist view on creation, prehistory,<br>
prehistoric man and animals, age of the universe and the like? Just curious!<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Drew Corrigan.<br>
<p>
[The SDA church official stand is that Genesis 1 is literally true and<br>
that the world was created in six literal days a few thousand years ago.<br>
 Those who believe otherwise have learned to keep their mouth shut. <br>
There are some hints in early Ellen G. White writings of where so-called<br>
apemen fossils may have originated, but no article of faith on this. <br>
The universe is thought to be much older because of our belief that<br>
intelligent life exists elsewhere in it.  <br>
<p>
Evolution is officially a taboo topic on SDAnet because of various flame<br>
wars which occured during the unmoderated Merger period.  But since that<br>
time, evolution-related topics have come up and nobody has dared to<br>
touch them, such as the time when people asked if evolution was taught<br>
at Andrews University and none of the ten Andrews faculty on this list<br>
dared say a word.  SCT]<br>

Jesus said the Holy Spirit would witness of him.  See John 15:26-27.  The<br>
Holy Spirit could hardly be expected to say something different fromwhat<br>
Jesus and the Father--and therefore the Scriptures--already said.<br>
<p>
One would imagine that if the content of the message is different, the<br>
origin is also different.  But to be able to argue that, one needs to<br>
be clear on the inspiration and authority of the Bible.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
I do not believe that the reason that none of the 10 Andrews faculty on<br>
this list did not respond to the question of evolution being taught at<br>
Andrews was because that we didn't dare to.  As a member of the Computer<br>
Science department, I know that it is not being taught in our<br>
department. -:)  I suspect that the others haven't responded for the<br>
same reasons that I haven't and that is that I have been teaching an<br>
overload and haven't had the time.<br>
<p>
I have not had close contact with the Biology department, but from the<br>
discussions that I have been in, I do not believe that evolution as a<br>
source of major development (macro evolution) is taught there.<br>
<p>
As a lay person just like anyone else, I believe that there may be<br>
evidence for micro evolution, small changes occuring due to cross<br>
breeding, mutation, etc.  I believe that evidence to support this can be<br>
found around any dairy farm, or horse stables.  I certainly see evidence<br>
of it in the local TV commercials for different varieties of corn that<br>
are good for this or that.<br>
<p>
Everyone can flame away at this, I am leaving for a three week vacation<br>
with my family and will have a great time reguardless of what is said.<br>

<i>&gt; Why do the "Right to Life" people almost never speak up about drunk</i><br>
<i>&gt; driving (causes tens of thousands of deaths per year), war, capital</i><br>
<i>&gt; punishment and other needless loss of life?  What is their real issue?</i><br>
<i>&gt; They don't seem very loving or concerned with the quality of life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They have even taken life from time to time in the form of bombings</i><br>
<i>&gt; and burnings.  Where are they really comming from?</i><br>
 <br>
Below is an interesting posting showing the views of various special<br>
interest groups on the subject of life.<br>
 <br>
What this illustrates is that these groups are not at all consistent<br>
in their views, perhaps because they don't have a source of divine<br>
inspiration.  I am not sure that we want to get into a discussion of<br>
abortion in this forum.  But it might be profitable to discuss some of<br>
the issues with the Christian view of life:<br>
 <br>
	- humans are created in the image of God<br>
 <br>
	- God says "thou shalt not kill"<br>
 <br>
	- we live in a world that is fallen and sinful<br>
 <br>
	- God blessed the children of Israel and sanctioned their<br>
	killing in some cases (wars)<br>
 <br>
	- Paul can be interpreted to support the formation of a civil<br>
	police function which by its nature sometimes must use deadly<br>
	force<br>
 <br>
	- most of us would support the American Revolution which<br>
	involved the slaughter of the British (guerilla warfare!)<br>

This information originally came from a SPY magazine survey, reported<br>
by Utne Reader (Jan/Feb, 1992, pg.152, "Kill Ted Bundy!  But save the<br>
cows!").  Given the current discussions on GRANOLA, I thought others<br>
might find this interesting.<br>
 <br>
The following organizations were asked about their position on<br>
life-and- death issues:<br>
 <br>
 * Council for a Livable Word (CLW) - pro-disarmament<br>
 * American Life Lobby (ALL) - anti-abortion<br>
 * Washington Legal Foundation (WLF) - pro-capital punishment<br>
 * National Coalition Against the Death Penalty (NCADP)<br>
 * Ducks Unlimited (DU) - conserve wetlands to provide ducks for hunting<br>
 * People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA)<br>
 * American Vegan Society (AVS) - wear no animal-derived clothing<br>
 <br>
Below are their reponses to each question.<br>
 <br>
1.  Would you kill a human fetus?<br>
 <br>

(ALL)   - No: "Life is sacred in all cases."<br>
(WLF)   - No: "There is nothing inconsistent with being pro-death<br>
               penalty and pro-life."<br>

(DU)    - "I can't comment, you know."<br>
(PeTA)  - "We would have to poll our members to find their views."<br>
(AVS)   - No: "It is a living creature whose life we must respect."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
2.  Would you kill a death-row inmate?<br>
 <br>
(CLW)   - No: "This is the destruction of innocent life."<br>
(ALL)   - Yes: "We want to protect all *innocent* life."<br>
(WLF)   - Yes: "You know it.  Sanctity-of-life-does not apply."<br>
(NCADP) - No: "The death penalty is morally wrong."<br>
(DU)    - "Again, I can only talk about fowl."<br>
(PeTA)  - "I can't comment unless a member asked about it."<br>

 <br>
 <br>
3.  Would you kill a brain-dead person?<br>
 <br>
(CLW)   - No: "Euthanasia is a form of suicide."<br>

 <br>
 <br>

(NCADP) - "As a group we can't agree."<br>
(DU)    - Yes: "i suppose so. Yes."<br>
(PeTA)  - We'd be more convcerned with animals."<br>

 <br>
 <br>
6.  Would you kill a cow for food?<br>
 <br>
(CLW)   - Yes.<br>
(ALL)   - Yes: "That's not a concern to us."<br>
(WLF)   - "The only issue we get involved in is the death penalty."<br>
(NCADP) - "We don't address those issues."<br>
(DU)    - "I can only talk about fowl."<br>
(PeTA)  - No: "We oppose any process that harasses an animal."<br>
(AVS)   - No. "We are total vegetarians."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
7.  Would you kill a cat for a lab experiment?<br>

(ALL)   - Yes: "If animal-rights people were honest, even broccoli is<br>
                alive."<br>
(WLF)   - "The only issue we get involved in is the death penalty."<br>
(NCADP) - "I can't say."<br>
(DU)    - No comment.<br>
(PeTA)  - No: "It is wrong to exploit or abuse any animal."<br>
(AVS)   - No: "We oppose any sort of animal torture."<br>

A couple of emailings ago the topic was "Right to Life".<br>
 <br>
Here I am speaking for myself, from my personal perspective as an SDA.<br>
I am not quoting from any SDA publication.  This is just my thinking.<br>
 <br>
SDAs do not believe that an eternally living soul is created at<br>
conception that will live on and on into eternity.  So we do not<br>
hold to any New Age or Catholic or other belief that says that<br>
such an eternal everlasting life must be protected even from the first<br>
nanosecond of life in the womb.  My personal concern for the fetus<br>
begins with the first possibility of real consciousness.  When does<br>
that begin?  I don't think there is a clear answer to the question.<br>
When babies can freely be aborted at an age later than prematures<br>
can readily survive then to me its clear we are well into the time zone<br>
of conscious viable life that is being murdered.  So, for the baby<br>
in the womb, my concern about life escalates throughout the pregnancy.<br>
 <br>
What about mom?  Just as rape has a devastating impact on a woman for<br>
the rest of her life, so does an abortion.  Certainly the sense of<br>
guilt and loss of having terminated a late term pregnancy has got to<br>
weigh heavily on any mother.  To a lesser degree this can also be<br>
true from the first nanosecond after conception.  Before the first<br>
nanosecond of conception in the case of an unmarried couple.<br>
 <br>
Certainly there are circumstances where we are out of blacks and whites<br>
and into the grey.  What about a rape situation?  What about medical<br>
complications?  We cannot be iron clad in ruling what can and cannot<br>
be done.<br>
 <br>
What about a woman's right to decide for herself?  Here is my answer:<br>
I'd like to see somebody put together a video as follows:<br>
 <br>
 * Scenes from the swet shop days; long hours of child labor with<br>
   supervisors brutalizing kids to get yet another ounce of work out<br>
   of tiny kids working the textile mills or what ever.  A scene<br>
   in which the owner of one of these mills turns to the camera and<br>
   says -- "I have a right to do with these kids what ever I want to".<br>
 <br>
 * Scenes of child abuse in the home 50 or more years ago when people<br>
   looked the other way when a mom or dad smashed their child in the<br>
   face with a fist.  And then turns to the camera to say that "I have<br>
   a right to do what ever I like in my own home".<br>
 <br>
 * What about dad beating up mom and turning to the camera to say<br>
   that he has a right to do anything he wants to do in his own house.<br>
 <br>
It is interresting that today a parent can be thrown in jail on the<br>
rumor that he or she has abused a premature child of 6, 7 or 8 months<br>
and yet a 9 month baby not quite yet born can be murdered and that<br>
is considered pro-choice.  To me, pro-choice makes sense as something<br>
that someone else can decide when its decided before a fetus becomes<br>
a conscious fetus.  To me a fetus becomes a baby when its brain can<br>
register pain, certainly by the time mom can first feel activity.<br>
 <br>
I don't believe the laws on abortion should be thrown to the wind, nor<br>
do I believe they should be radical pro-life.  We seem to be polarizing<br>
in this country and that I think is a mistake.  I believe the rules,<br>
just like the taxes, need to be graduated.  Perhaps even no restrictions<br>
at the real early end of the scale.  And a full review board and federal<br>
judge at the other end of the pregnancy.  People seem so humanly<br>
procastinating in their tendency to put off the decision.  So, if<br>
9 months is still ok for an abortion, then people will wait till<br>
the last millisecond of 9 months.  By then we clearly have human life<br>
that could have been a born baby for a month or two, even three these<br>
days with modern prenatal technology.<br>
 <br>
Well, those are my thoughts.  If Steve thinks this topic is too likely<br>
to burn out of control then I'll not protest if this post of mine does<br>
not get posted.<br>

Steve,<br>
 <br>
Is it an improvement in content and substance over Spectrum, the last<br>
SDA effort at targeting the collegiate/young adult readership?<br>
 <br>
Stan<br>
 <br>
[I think so, primarily because it does not assume that all between 20-30<br>
are rebels by nature.  Some people will think this same feature makes it<br>
worse.  Also note that Spectrum magazine is not an official<br>
denominational publication.  (Was it ever one?  Was there a different<br>
magazine from the Spectrum we all know and love today?)<br>
 <br>
At the "20something" meeting where the test issues were distributed,<br>
everyone was reading them instead of listening to the program, myself<br>
included, and I was on the group responsible for the program.  That says<br>
something about the appeal of the magazine or the boringness of our<br>
program.  SCT]<br>

  When does your church say the early Christian church went into<br>
apostacy?  I mean, what date?<br>
<p>
Scott       | No success can compensate for failure in the home. David O. McKay<br>
Mattes      | President 1951-70, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<br>
[The apostasy was a gradual process over a period of hundreds of years.<br>
The Sabbath was already in danger as early as 130 or 140.  Yet we still <br>
accept a New Testament that was only codified in the late 300's as Scripture.<br>
Other practices such as baptism by immersion persisted in the church for<br>
a few hundred years after that (and continue to this day in the Orthodox<br>
church).  The canonical date where the apostate church received power <br>
is 538 AD.  SCT]<br>

The subject of Noah's Ark has been a hobby of mine since 1974.  And I am<br>
currently in the process of organizing Ark-athon II,  a Noah's Ark<br>
convention.  This will be a time with many of those who are or have been<br>
involved with the search for the Ark can meet together exchange stories<br>
and share expirences.  One of the main purposes of the meeting is to debunk<br>
the claims of Ron Wyatt, David Fasold and others who claim that the<br>
durunipar geologic formation is the Ark.<br>
<p>
No, SDA's are not the only ones fooled by such nonsense.  I hear from several<br>
of the other researchers that people from all Christian walks have been<br>
misled by these people.<br>
<p>
If it all works out, Ark-athon II will be held in January, 93 here in <br>
Portland, Oregon.  I'll fill you in as things become more definate.<br>

Yes Randall, there are other Libertarian SDAs.  My husband and I have<br>
both been members of the national party, although the last two states<br>
we have lived in (OK and KY) are vehemently 2-party states.  My whole<br>
family in California has been Libertarian for years, and my Dad and<br>
brother were even delegates to the state convention in the 80s.  To me,<br>
it is the position that makes the most sense from a Christian viewpoint.<br>
Christ was one of the least coercive leaders in history, and God values<br>
our freedom of choice over our salvation!  As one of our pastors said<br>
our God-given power to love others too often turns into the love of<br>
power over others, thus all the attempts to legislate people's private<br>
lives...<br>

<p>
This letter was not read to the SDA church I go to. I would have thought<br>
it would be because our church is the largest one in the conference and<br>
many conference leaders attend it. In my opinion, our  church isn't <br>
doing a very good job of informing its members whats going on as far as the<br>
church in actual government events. Maybe they do in one of its publications<br>
and I just don't know about it. But, I feel this is a very important topic.<br>
So I ask a similar question to Steve's, does anyone know any more about this?<br>

With regard to the postings about A.C McClure's letter seeking prayer<br>
about religious liberty issues and how recent court decisions have <br>
turned out, it is significant that the SDA church's Religious Liberty <br>
department is moving toward seeking legislation to protect religious <br>
liberty, rather than relying on constitutional protection alone.  I will<br>
excerpt below a portion of the one-page "Perspective" column in the <br>
May/June 1992 issue of Liberty magazine.  It is entitled "A PLEA TO<br>
CONGRESSIONAL STAFFPERSONS and was released by Gary M. Ross on <br>
May 11, 1992."<br>
<p>
***************************************************************************<br>
<p>
    Religious liberty is no "luxury:"  it remains the inalienable<br>
  right granted by God Himself to His creation and is therefore not <br>
  subject to human manipulation.<br>
<p>
    Because of this verity, the Seventh-day Adventist Church joins many <br>
  other organizations in deploring "Oregon v. Smith" and in advocating <br>
  expeditious consideration by Congress of the reversal bill introduced by<br>
  Mr. Solarz (D-N.Y.)<br>
  ...<br>
  ...<br>
    Egregiously the "Smith" ruling subordinates religious expression to<br>
  laws that are facially neutral and generally applicable.  Redress is <br>
  obtainalbe through exemptions granted by legislatures, but in Justice <br>
  Scalia's own words, "leaving accommodation to the political process will<br>
  place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not<br>
  widely engaged in."<br>
<p>
    But, replied Justice O'Connor, "the First Amendment was enacted <br>
  precisely to protect the rights of those whose religious practices are<br>
  not shared by the majority and may be viewed with hostility."<br>
<p>
    Worse even than vacating a reasonable and workable test, the Court<br>
  (1) did so without argument, inasmuch as the relevant oral arguments <br>
  presupposed that test; (2) subsequently denied a petition for rehearing; <br>
  and (3) immediately demonstrated through "Hershberger" and other findings<br>
  that its new rule of law was not an aberration.<br>
 <br>
    A consensus of historic magnitude underlies the Religious Freedom<br>
  Restoration Act....<br>
<p>
    Enactment of this bill, H.R. 2797, is absolutely imperative.<br>
  ...<br>
  ...<br>
    "Adventists often encounter religious liberty problems in Communist, <br>
  Muslim, and other nations," says Pastor Al McClure, president of the <br>
  church in North America, "but it is sobering to note that the United<br>
  States Supreme Court has upset decades of settled constitutional law<br>
  regarding the most special rights of minorities."<br>
<p>
****************************************************************************<br>
<p>
I assume this is what Pastor McClure had in mind when he sent the letter<br>
some of you netters have referred to to the churches in this division.<br>
It was not read at my home church this past week.  Maybe it was read at<br>
an earlier week and I missed it.  I can understand why it may not be<br>
read.  The pastor in a given Adventist church gets a fair amount of mail <br>
each week (at least, this is what one pastor told me was the case with<br>
him) and there is only so much time in the church service to discuss<br>
matters such as these.  Still, this does seem like an issue important <br>
enough to merit special mention from the pulpit.<br>
<p>
It is sad that we feel we must advocate legislative means to protect what<br>
had long been thought of as a basic constitutional right.  It appears that<br>
such a bill is turning out to be necessary however.<br>
<p>
Any comments?<br>

In the latest issue of Dialogue magazine the advertisement about SDAnet<br>
appears.  Similar advertising for SDA-L proved fruitful some time ago, and <br>
I hope this will generate lots of new memberships for SDAnet.  Thanks to <br>
Dialogue for running the information for free.  Now on to working on <br>
Spectrum, then View, then reView.<br>
<p>
Like most churches, however, most people find out about SDAnet by word<br>
of mouth or word of mail.  So if you like it, please tell a friend.<br>
If you don't like it, please tell an enemy.  <br>

Thanks for the reply Steve,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [The SDA church official stand is that Genesis 1 is literally true and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the world was created in six literal days a few thousand years ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Those who believe otherwise have learned to keep their mouth shut. </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are some hints in early Ellen G. White writings of where so-called</i><br>
<i>&gt; apemen fossils may have originated, but no article of faith on this. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The universe is thought to be much older because of our belief that</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent life exists elsewhere in it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Evolution is officially a taboo topic on SDAnet.</i><br>
<p>
Noting your last line here, I am not interested in seeing flames, just <br>
curious.<br>
<p>
I take it from your first paragraph that SDAs must hold views similar to<br>
many Creation Scientists who claim that carbon and other forms of dating<br>
are inaccurate for one or more reasons such as the Flood, speed of light<br>
decreasing, etc.. <br>
<p>
Is this addressed in any rigourous fashion? I'm curious partly because I<br>
like to understand the beliefs of others, and also because I wonder how you<br>
would respond to potential converts who say "well I agree with you about <br>
the Sabbath, but I disagree with regards to you understanding of Genesis."<br>
In an increasingly humanistic society, one needs well thought out answers<br>
to the questions posed by those coming to understand the truth.<br>
<p>
Also, what is the Biblical basis for believing intelligent life (presumably<br>
material, and not spirit) exists elsewhere in the universe?<br>
[The reference to the sons of God in Job 1 is the best clue, also in<br>
the latter part of Job "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons<br>
of God shouted for joy.SCT]<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Drew Corrigan.<br>
<p>
[Harold Coffin's book "Origin By Design" is perhaps the most complete <br>
setting forth of Biblical Creationism. (Pacific Press, 1983).  He works <br>
for the Geoscience Research Institute, an organization funded by the church <br>
to explore scientific alternatives to the evolutionary hypothesis.  As far<br>
as I know he has never advocated that the speed of light decreased or some <br>
of the really far-out stuff, but he certainly does dispute the conventional<br>
interpretation of organic and inorganic dating methods.<br>
<p>
As to how we should relate to people who have trouble believing the creation <br>
story, I face this problem regularly myself with my "significant other"<br>
and would be open to anyone who has a solution to this problem on the net.SCT]<br>

A question from an "outsider" :-),<br>
<p>
Who is A. C. McClure? How are the Adventists organised and governed?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Drew Corrigan.<br>
[A.C. McClure is the president of the North American Division <br>
of Seventh-day Adventists.  He, along with eleven other division presidents<br>
around the world, is responsible to the General Conference and appointed by <br>
it, there is also an overall president and five general vice-presidents.<br>
The General Conference leadership is picked by the full session which meets<br>
every five years and whose delegates are chosen by the union conferences,<br>
which correspond roughly to international boundaries around the world, <br>
except for large places such as India, USA, Australia which are chopped into <br>
more than one union.  Within the unions there are conferences and fields.<br>

<p>
"Knowning the Truth About Creation" by Norman L.  Geisler (ISBN<br>
0-89283-389-0, Servant Books, 1989) sort of touches on this issue in<br>
the chapter titled "The Philosophical Arguments:"<br>
<p>
	Rational arguments offer proof but do not necessarily<br>
	persuade unbelievers of God's existence.  They may be <br>
	objectively correct but not always subjectively <br>
	convincing. [...] They can "lead the horse to the <br>
	water," but only the Holy Spirit can persuade a person<br>
	to drink. [pp. 79]<br>
<p>
I haven't read Harold Coffin's "Origin by Design," so I cannot compare<br>
the two, but I think Geisler did a good job presenting the creationist<br>
position, although he didn't do justice to "language." (That is, he<br>
could of at least mention the fact that any honest non-creationistic<br>
linguist would admit that the origin of language is "unknown."  Any<br>
and every language origin theory, excluding extra-terrestrial ones,<br>
has been debunked by linguists, as far as I know.  In fact, today, any<br>
presenter of "language origin" would be laughed off the stage, swiftly<br>
and promptly, by linguists.)<br>
<p>
Books I would recommend for unbelievers (of creationism or just plain<br>
theism) would be C.S. Lewis' "Mere Christianity" and G.K. Chesterson's<br>
"Orthodoxy."  They were both, at best, agnostics before accepting<br>
Christianity AND creationism (I had to write this, since creation no<br>
longer seems to be a part of today's "Christianity." :-) Please note<br>
that their presentations are a bit philosophical (i.e., not a light<br>
reading, in my opinion).<br>

This isn't specifically on creationism but it is on "science".  I was<br>
recently reading some of Karl Popper's writings on the philosophy of<br>
science.  He said something very interesting.  It went something like<br>
this:<br>
<p>
	Science, like religion, is based on faith but is a little<br>
	less honest about its need to do so.<br>

I am a professor of mathematics at Montana State University.<br>
For several years, my wife and I have sponsored regular<br>
fellowship activities for SDA's attending the university.  We<br>
would like to hear from other SDA professors and students<br>
located at public colleges and universities.  I can be reached<br>
via the Internet at umsfdtho@deimos.oscs.montana.edu or <br>

What song in the old _Church Hymnal_ has a tune written by Stephen Foster?<br>
(Hint, it didn't make the new hymnal, nor is the tune attributed to him<br>
in the old.)<br>

The following letter to the editor was in the July 6, 1992 Pacific Union<br>
Recorder:<br>
<p>
	SABBATH A DAY OF RESTORATION<br>
<p>
Thank you very much for publicizing in your June 1 issue La Sierra University's<br>
contribution to the clean-up of Los Angeles following the recent uprising. . .<br>
<p>
We are writing to let you know of one correction in your story. According<br>
to the story, members of the La Sierra University community "traveled to<br>
downtwon Los Angeles May 3."  In fact, the La Sierra group whose photograph<br>
appears on page 22 joined in the relief efforts that took place on Sabbath,<br>
May 2.<br>
<p>
While the group was student-organized, it enjoyed the support of University<br>
administrators and faculty members.  The trip was approved by University<br>
President Fritz Guy; and Don Van Orman, vice president for financial affairs,<br>
Bob Dunn, associate dean of the College of ARts and Sciences, and Charles<br>
Teel, Jr., professor of religion and sociology and director of the Stahl Center<br>
for World Service, joined students and others as they worked in LA.<br>
<p>
We believe the University's participation in these Sabbath clean-up efforts<br>
in an appropriate expression of the meaning of the Sabbath.  Deuteronomy 5<br>
makes clear that the purpose of the Sabbath includes renewal of the world:<br>
on the Sabbath, Israel is to rest, as a sign of rest from bondage that they<br>
enjoy because of God's Exodus liberation.  Exodus 20 suggests that the Sabbath<br>
is also an affirmation of the goodness of creation--and thus of the freedom<br>
and dignity of persons as God created them.  Work on behalf of freedom and<br>
dignity is therefore an appropriate form of Sabbath-keeping.<br>
<p>
Finally, Jesus' healing miracles on the Sabbath underscore this fundamental<br>
emphasis on the Sabbath as a day for making the world whole.  That is why<br>
we believe it made sense for LSU to assist in LA on the Sabbath.  And that is<br>
why we believe it is important for RECORDER readers to know that our trip<br>
took place on Sabbath, May 2.<br>

------------------<br>
<p>
I have a few questions for subscribers on SDAnet about this.  First, do you<br>
generally agree that clean-up efforts following the riots in LA was an<br>
appropriate task on the Sabbath?  What would your local SDA congreation say<br>
about this?  Is this an isolated belief or is it generally accepted that<br>
community service projects of this type are appropriate to do on Sabbath<br>
(rather than Sunday) as in this case?  *IF* the Sabbath is "a day for making<br>
for world whole", would clean-up projects like picking up litter along the<br>
freeway, painting over inner-city graffiti, or pulling weeks in a public<br>
park also be appropriate for a Sabbath afternoon?<br>
<p>
What impact do you think this might have on future religious liberty cases<br>
before the Supreme Court in regards to Sabbath observance and a service<br>
employee's refusal to work on the Sabbath?  If clean-up efforts on the<br>
Sabbath (rather than Sunday) is justified as a Sabbath activity, how can<br>
SDA defend a refusal to work in a service-related occupation on the Sabbath?<br>
<p>
My basic understandin of Sabbath observance is that the day has been set<br>
apart by God for His people to refrain from the work and mundane things of this<br>
life.  We have been given six other days every week to take care worldly<br>
things.  I am having difficulty understanding *WHY* LSU decided that this<br>
clean-up effort had to be done on Sabbath.  Why couldn't they do it on Sunday?<br>
Should not out-of-ordinary projects be done on Sabbath *ONLY* if it cannot be<br>
done on another day of the week?<br>
<p>

<p>
[Ignoring the fact that this was probably the only time such a group could <br>
be got together, the effort is commendable.  Jesus asked the Pharisees<br>
"Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?"  He never got an answer, but he <br>
proceeded to show by actions what His thoughts were on the matter.<br>
Although I personally view the Sabbath as a time primarily for the church <br>
family to focus on healing and building relationships within itself and with <br>
God, I also believe kindness is always appropriate.  <br>
 <br>
If you examine the miracles of Jesus and the number of healings of long-term,<br>
chronic disease that He performed on the Sabbath, even though these people<br>
could have waited longer, I think we see that although sometimes kindness <br>
can wait until after the Sabbath, it need not do so.  However, we should not<br>
use participation in such activities on the Sabbath to excuse involvement<br>
for the rest of the week.  More comments are welcome.  SCT]<br>

<p>
I've wondered about this for years.  We rely on services such as<br>
electricity and telephones, which require people to work on the<br>
Sabbath to maintain.<br>
<p>
If a relative dies in a distant area, we will probably fly there on<br>
Sabbath.  If our child gets sick, we may go to a pharmacy on Sabbath<br>
to fill a prescription.<br>
<p>
At the same time, we would frown on someone working for a utility on<br>
Sabbath or flying a plane or working as a pharmacist on Sabbath.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that a different view of the Sabbath is implied by<br>
these things, but I've never been able to flesh out what that view is.<br>
Perhaps others can help with thinking this through.<br>

  Scott and Linda Mattes are pleased to announce the arrival of their<br>
son, David Scott, on 7/13/92.  David showed up at 0645EDT after giving<br>
his mother just about 3 hours of grief (labor).  Measuring 22" and 10lb<br>
3.5oz (really, not bad, we were expecting 11-12lb), David has large<br>
hands and feet and medium brown hair.  Sisters Toni (7), Carolyn (3) and<br>
Lindsay (1) are pleased as punch that bother finally showed up.  Mom is<br>
doing well and is very pleased that the month and a half of daily labor<br>
pains are over with.<br>
<p>
  Watch this space for further additions, say in 2-3 years.<br>

When we consider what we will and won't do on Sabbath, we often think<br>
only of the effect it will have on ourselves:  will this somehow<br>
``disrupt'' the day for me?  Will it affect _my_ day?  So when we go to<br>
the pharmacy, use the telephone, or turn on the electric light, we<br>
justify it as insignificant, yet it is easy to forget that someone,<br>
somewhere, is doing what is to them a perfectly ordinary day's work in<br>
order to provide it for us.  Is not this a rather selfish attitude to<br>
the Sabbath?<br>
<p>
In a world where everyone kept the Sabbath, would everything stop for<br>
24 hours, or would we share the jobs around?  Would we consider some<br>
things essential, and if so, which?  It is possible to do without a<br>
lot, if we really tried, yet how many of our Sabbath acitivities would<br>
stop, including church programs, if we only carried out the bare<br>
necessities?  Would we be better or worse off?<br>
<p>
To balance this, I know many people who work in various areas on<br>
Sabbath, but mostly in ``health services'' such as nurses, doctors,<br>
hospital ancillary staff, an ambulance officer or two, etc.  Yet there<br>
are many other areas that at least by our practices we appear to take<br>
for granted as an essential.<br>

A few months ago I tossed out a hot potato which I thought would raise a <br>
firestorm on the net, and there were no responses at all.  It regarded the <br>
court ruling made some time back in the trademark case of SDA Kinship <br>
versus the General Conference.  (Kinship is the organization of <br>
homosexuals and lesbians which draws from Adventist members.)  As I remember,<br>
the court found for Kinship because they were not using the name<br>
"Seventh-day Adventist" in conjunction with "church."  The details are<br>
to be found <br>
in Spectrum.  I had originally only published the short blurb that appeared<br>
in the Review.<br>
<p>
What struck me about the Spectrum report was that the secretary of<br>
Kinship who spoke on the record to Spectrum was a classmate of mine at<br>
Andrews<br>
University.  I had at one time gone on a date with her, and never suspected<br>
this might be the case; it also implied that another female classmate of<br>
mine whom I knew to be living with her might well be more than a<br>
roommate.<br>
<p>
I raise this question now because I will shortly be faced with giving<br>
counsel to yet another friend who has recently been through the breakup<br>
of such <br>
a relationship.  And though I could pound the keyboard for hours about the <br>
gay rights lobby that wants to pervert the morals of our children, this<br>
won't help my friends.<br>
<p>
What does the SDA church have to say to homosexuals today?  (not AT, _TO_)<br>
What will it take to develop an approach which emphasizes Bible morality<br>
and relationship theology, not fear-mongering and insults?<br>
<p>
I could say more, but I'd like to hear from the net on this one.<br>
<p>

I agree whole-heartedly with the project in LA and what the students did<br>
on the Sabbath. More power to them.<br>

{Anecdote Alert!!!}<br>
<p>
Boy, does this baby hit real close to home.<br>
<p>
I had dated a girl right out of HS who was pretty nice, somewhat<br>
aggressive. It was one of those summertime romances which fell<br>
apart one semester into my freshman year in college. The killer<br>
part was that, when we were going out, she wanted to be with me<br>
all the time. So much so that she enrolled at the same college,<br>
and the same dorm, as I was. By the time she arrived on campus<br>
the next year, I didn't want anything to do w/ her. <br>
<p>
She became very active in some campus activities, particularly<br>
gay and lesbian rights groups. It was my final year in college<br>
when a friend of mine asked me if I knew that my ex was a <br>
lesbian. <br>
<p>
Knowing her family history and background, it really didn't <br>
come as a surprise. Sometimes I think that, because I was the<br>
last male she had dated, that I was somewhat responsible for<br>
making her turn tail. But I don't think so. She will do what<br>
she wants, regardless of what I have to say. For what it's<br>
worth, I don't feel it's my fault that she is a lesbian.<br>
<p>
I hope that, for her sake, that she continues to be her own <br>
person, and that she doesn't follow other people just because<br>
they say they're right. And I have no qualms about admitting<br>
that I dated a lesbian. As disgusting and immoral the practice<br>
is, she made her own choice and my only response is to be<br>
quiet. We haven't talked for years, though friends of mine <br>
have given me some updates from campus, where she writes a<br>
column for the campus newspaper.<br>
<p>
I'm not a preacher, nor do I profess to have the answers. That's<br>
why I feel that, no matter what I could say to her, any counsel<br>
about the immorality of her lifestyle would be fruitless. <br>
Instead, I would try to counsel along lines more familiar to<br>
me, the love that Jesus Christ has for all people, even those<br>
who are on the fringe of life. Inclusion is a more effective and<br>
uplifting technique, IMHO, than hammering my morality.<br>
<p>
It's true: until it's someone you know or if you are in that <br>
situation yourself, you have no idea whatsoever how to deal <br>
with the situation.<br>
<p>
Maybe I'll post a real response later. Back to work, ya know?<br>

<i>&gt; And though I could pound the keyboard for hours about the </i><br>
<i>&gt; gay rights lobby that wants to pervert the morals of our children, this</i><br>
<i>&gt; won't help my friends.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What does the SDA church have to say to homosexuals today?  (not AT, _TO_)</i><br>
<i>&gt; What will it take to develop an approach which emphasizes Bible morality</i><br>
<i>&gt; and relationship theology, not fear-mongering and insults?</i><br>
<p>
This is probably not exhaustive, but I reckon there are two basic reasons<br>
for homosexuality - being persuaded by Satan's sophistries (in all its forms)<br>
because we are not wise in God's ways and words (Jer 50:6; Ps 119:11), and<br>
outright rebellion against God's order and against His design for our bodies.<br>
[Interestingly, those are sort of the basics that underly the transgressions<br>
of each and every one of us (Isa 53:6).  Morris Venden has an apt sermon<br>
title:  "God Says, But I Think".]<br>
<p>
A heart in rebellion is not open to being taught of the Lord (Jam 4:6,<br>
1Pet 5:5, Prov 14:9); the heart that is humble is teachable (Ps 25, also<br>
other refs in Psalms &amp; Proverbs).  Getting it that way can come from<br>
recognizing God's goodness and mercy (Rom 2:4).<br>
<p>
For your friend?  Comfort (1 Pet 5:7).  Assurance (Rom 5:8).  Basic stuff<br>
on God's unconditional acceptance of us to save us.  Scripture is full<br>
of examples of people who really blew it, yet God's love for them was<br>
unrequited (cf. David, King Manasseh).  Then, move on to Lordship.  Romans 5<br>
&amp; 6 and Colossians 2 &amp; 3 are basic.  One needs to want to discover and follow<br>
God's purposes (cf. Phi 2:13), which desire God promises to give to us.<br>
Grace is the desire and the power to do His will.  Grace is the indwelling<br>
Holy Spirit (Rev 3:20).<br>
<p>
Establish the basics and let the Holy Spirit prepare the heart and present<br>
openings for specifics on God's best (going from milk to meat, Heb 5, 1Pet 2).<br>
Rejoice in that both inherited and cultivated sinful tendencies can be<br>
and are to be overcome (2Cor 12:9; Rev 21:7 and others in Revelation as well<br>
as elsewhere in the NT).<br>
<p>
We were not born male or female by chance; God made us that way (Gen 1:27, 5:2;<br>
Ps 139:14-16).  As surely as His power sustains the universe, He sustains us<br>
from the moment of conception (Acts 17:28); indeed, we were custom designed<br>
(Ps 139:16).  Babies just do not "happen" (cf. Gen 29:31, et al).  Is it His<br>
design for any to have homosexual tendencies?  I say No (cf. Rom 1).  We may<br>
because of our race's fallen condition (Ex 20:5b), but God has a solution<br>
(Ex 20:6; 1Jn 1:9, 2Pet 3:18))<br>

<i>&gt;It regarded the court ruling made some time back in the trademark case</i><br>

<i>&gt;in the Review.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What struck me about the Spectrum report was that the secretary of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Kinship who spoke on the record to Spectrum was a classmate of mine at</i><br>
<i>&gt;Andrews</i><br>
<i>&gt;University.  I had at one time gone on a date with her, and never suspected</i><br>
<i>&gt;this might be the case; it also implied that another female classmate of</i><br>
<i>&gt;mine whom I knew to be living with her might well be more than a</i><br>
<i>&gt;roommate.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I raise this question now because I will shortly be faced with giving</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What does the SDA church have to say to homosexuals today?  (not AT, _TO_)</i><br>
<i>&gt;What will it take to develop an approach which emphasizes Bible morality</i><br>
<i>&gt;and relationship theology, not fear-mongering and insults?</i><br>
<p>
These are very difficult questions for the SDA church to face. Especially<br>
now with AIDS, its something so hard. I'm not an SDA church leader and<br>
I don't even know the "official" church stand on homosexuality but as a<br>
member I can share some thoughts that young adult groups around here have<br>
discussed. First of all, knowing someone who is homosexual does make it<br>
very personal and we all have to remember that no matter what, condemning<br>
others for ANYTHING is not the Christian way. The Bible does talk about<br>
homosexuality being a sinful thing, but so is lying, stealing, etc. and<br>
we are taught that God doesn't like ANY sin. So, if homosexuals are frowned<br>
upon, so should all other sinners be treated so. <br>
<p>
Now, this is easy to say, but when it comes right down to it, most people<br>
still have some "homophobia" ideas. I know that I catch myself sometimes<br>
going along with jokes or whatever but its wrong. <br>
<p>
In my opinion, God bases his judgement on intent. He loves everyone, no<br>
matter what but sin is sin. I'm sorry that I don't have the theological<br>
intelligence to explain this any better but this is what I mean: <br>
<p>
     God created man and women to be together. I truly feel bad for<br>
     those that have different tendencies because they are still<br>
     people, like me, and circumstances should not be blamed on them.<br>
     But, homosexuality is not God's plan (just like any sin) and if<br>
     you engage in it intentionally, then you are sinning. <br>
<p>
Now, since we are all sinners, we should not be pointing the finger at them<br>
since none of us are any better. I think this is what Steve was talking<br>
about as far as "relationship theology" goes. But, I don't think there could<br>
be or should be a "Bible morality" idea supporting homosexuality. Just<br>
because we feel empathy, does not mean we should try to justify certain<br>
behaviors. <br>
<p>
Also, there is the health issue of homosexuality (and promiscuity). If I<br>
know I could die from doing certain things, then I'll try not to do them. <br>
Isn't that a simple concept? I know if I had a personal friend or relative<br>
who had the risk of dying from something like AIDS, I would do anything I<br>
could for that not to happen. <br>
<p>
Ultimately, its in God's hands and as far as I am concerned, thats where I'm<br>
going to leave it. What I try to live by is that I have to try to treat <br>
others like I want to be treated (golden rule). <br>
<p>
I just want to end with a story. In a group discussion about this once,<br>
a teacher told us about someone she knew that was homosexual(I'll call her<br>
'Lisa'). Lisa had always felt very self-conscious of the fact that she felt<br>
certain feelings for women instead of men. This weighed heavy on her as<br>
she got older and being a religious person, she always felt so guilty. Finally,<br>
she went ahead and had relationships with women. But, in the end she couldn't<br>
continue knowing that it was getting in the way of her and God. So, she<br>
took a stand that she would be celibate all her life. She would rather not<br>
experience sex, then to experience it in a "wrong" way. When I heard this<br>
I felt like crying. People like Lisa suffer. And I don't know if she was<br>
able to keep her stand, but quite truthfully, I don't care. All I know is<br>
that here was someone who had great courage. Don't we all try to lead<br>
sinless lives?? And what happens?? It doesn't work as easy as it sounds.<br>
So how can we expect others to be sinless if we aren't??? <br>
<p>
There's only one other thing. One point that bothers me is how do you<br>
justify things like gay rights parades?? I sin but the last thing I want to<br>
do is flaunt it. Maybe someone else has more thoughts to add to this....<br>
<p>
Sorry for such a long letter!! And I hope I didn't say anything that could<br>
be misunderstood. <br>
                               God bless,    ~Joanne<br>

As we look at the issue of homosexuality within and near the borders of <br>
the SDA church, it is helpful to examine the past record of the denomination<br>
on this.  The church at one time had a healing ministry for homosexuals,<br>
led by one Colin Cook, who claimed to be a recovered former homosexual.<br>
It turned out he wasn't quite recovered and led to a rather unsavory<br>
and unfortunate experience of which I don't know all the details.<br>
At that time he was sponsored by the denomination. <br>
<p>
Now I understand he is again trying to resume his ministry, this time on <br>
his own.  If any details are available, I would be interested to hear them.<br>
Needless to say this is a sore point with Kinship.<br>
<p>
The politically correct would have us believe that a homosexual orientation<br>
is born in, perhaps is even genetic.  Suppose this is the case.  Still<br>
this would be no different from alcoholism, which seems to show genetic <br>
factors.  No one believes alcoholism is any more acceptable just because<br>
it is an inherited tendency, nor does that inherited tendency inhibit<br>
recovery.  <br>
<p>
In fact, how is any sin different from alcoholism:  there is an inherited<br>
tendency to do it, and recovery is possible.  The "disease model" of sin<br>
is one which has a lot to teach us, but shouldn't be pushed too far.<br>

In our local paper this morning, there was an interesting<br>
item from Berkeley, CA:<br>
<p>
Because of declining local tax revenues, Berkeley is now<br>
considering enforcing an ordinance dating from the mid-70s.<br>
<p>
This ordinance requires churches inside the city limits to<br>
obtain a business license to continue operating.<br>
<p>
It also requires that the church pay a percentage of its<br>
offering to the city as taxes.<br>
<p>
Some Berkeley-area churches are unhappy about the proposed<br>
move.  Some aren't complaining, on the other hand.<br>
<p>
The city council apparently sees no problem with enforcing<br>
the ordinance (other than trying to collect from some<br>
uncooperative congregations).<br>

In regard to the church and state, did anyone notice the latest Review<br>
where it talks about Lynwood Adventist Academy in California?<br>
It appears that the public school district has won its long struggle<br>
to take over the property of the school by eminent domain.  The compensation<br>
for this was more than the district was originally going to pay, but less<br>
than what the church had asked for.  Scary if you ask me.<br>

In response to Joanne's story about "Lisa" and her choice of celebacy<br>
rather than homosexuality, I'd like to remind you that there are many<br>
devout Christian heterosexual singles who choose celebacy also.  The<br>
thing that has always troubled me about homosexuality is that somehow<br>
there's the idea that because a person has a sexual attraction to the<br>
same sex that they must act on it.  Many single people have sexual feelings<br>
for others of the opposite sex but because they believe that sex outside<br>
of marriage is sin, they abstain.  It's almost as if the world has come<br>
to the notion that sexual urgings must be carried out in acts of sin.<br>
Even if a gay or lesbian is struggling with their sexual feelings, there<br>
is no excuse for acting on them any more than two people of the opposite<br>
sex.  I personally feel that fornication between heterosexuals is just as<br>
sinful as homosexuals.  Why can't Christians view them as the same sin<br>
rather than single them out?<br>

I've noticed a few cases lately where people insert ^L (control-L) at<br>
the top of messages.  This messes up mail systems.  I use a very<br>
common UNIX mail system (MH Mail) and it clears my screen while in the<br>
middle of displaying a list of message summaries.<br>

This has little to do with any of the subjects under discussion, but I wanted<br>
to recommend a book.  It's called _The_Man_from_Lancer_Avenue_, by Trudy<br>
Morgan.  It's about Jesus, a story on His life set in the setting of today.<br>
Instead of fisherman, Andrews, Peter, James, and John are car repairmen.  Simon<br>
the zealot is pictured as a skinhead Nazi (I think), the man with leprosy is a <br>
homosexual with AIDS.<br>
<p>
It really gives some good ideas on how Jesus MIGHT confront many situations <br>
present today.  It's written in story form, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!<br>
<p>
Available at the Adventist Book Center.  <br>

Steve, was the right of eminent domain exercised because the state<br>
needed the land or because it needed the *school* that was already<br>
established upon the land?  If the later, I agree--very scary,<br>
indeed.<br>

One of the functions of the Holy Spirit is to reprove for sin. (John 16:8,9).<br>
We become convinced of the wrongness of a deed as the Holy Spirit speaks<br>
to our conscience (and here I include the ministry of the Spirit through<br>
the word of God.)  This knowledge leads to a repentance and a turning away<br>
from sin.<br>
<p>
...example of someone either ignoring the H.S. or ignorant of the<br>
Word of God...<br>
<p>
[You ask]<br>
(Q1) How should these circumstances be handled?<br>
(Q2) Is the Holy Spirit a license to do as we please?<br>
<p>
(A2) Absolutely not.  This is the what Jude was compelled to write <br>
against, "Ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licen-<br>
tiousness and [simultaneously] deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus <br>
Christ" (Jude 1:4). <br>
<p>
(A1) You must discern whether this individual is ignoring the H.S. or<br>
is ignorant of the WoG.  If the former, may I suggest you witness to<br>
him with the gospel.  If the later, you may want to disciple him in<br>
the precepts of the Christian faith.  Ask him about his relationship<br>
as a child of God and what it means to be submissive to the authority<br>
and rule of God.<br>

the general Adventist view on creation, prehistory, etc...<br>
<p>
[The SDA church official stand is that Genesis 1 is literally true and<br>
that the world was created in six literal days a few thousand years ago.<br>
The universe is thought to be much older because of our belief that<br>
intelligent life exists elsewhere in it.  SCT]<br>
<p>
[I ask]<br>
(Q1)  Are you, then, limiting the heaven and the earth of Genesis 1:1 <br>
to the planet Earth and its atmosphere?  What about the creation of <br>
the stars in Gen. 1:14?<br>
<p>
(Q2)  With all due respect, I thought the idea of extraterrestrial <br>
life was limited to those who got their information from the <br>
[blank] or the [blank].  [Original, unkind words deleted due to the<br>
prompting of the H.S.--DEB]  Is this truly a generally held SDA <br>
view?<br>
<p>
(Q3)  Accepting ET life for the sake of argument :), how does that <br>
presuppose an ancient universe?<br>

[The apostasy was a gradual process over a period of hundreds of years.<br>
Other practices such as baptism by immersion persisted in the church for<br>
a few hundred years after that (and continue to this day in the Orthodox<br>
church).  The canonical date where the apostate church received power <br>
is 538 AD.  SCT]<br>
<p>
[I ask]<br>
(Q1) What is the Orthodox church you refer to?  Are you commending<br>
it for its practices?<br>
<p>
(Q2) What power did the apostate church receive?  And who bestowed it?<br>

<p>
That's all for now.  God's grace and peace to you all.<br>

<i>&gt; This is probably not exhaustive, but I reckon there are two basic reasons</i><br>

<i>&gt; outright rebellion against God's order and against His design for our bodies.</i><br>
<p>
Somehow I doubt you've ever conversed all that much with many homosexuals.  I<br>
had a friend a few years back that was gay.  He told me that for him, there was<br>
no choice in the matter.  He was physically repulsed by the thought of sexual<br>
relations with a woman.  He wanted to know why God would allow him to be born<br>
in such a way that he -had- to live his entire life in guilt and misery simply<br>
because he wanted to love someone that was of the same gender, and -couldn't-<br>
love someone of the opposite gender in the same way.  There was no rebellion in<br>
him, just fear and sadness.  He got no comfort from other so-called Christians.<br>
They merely told him he was sinning against God and would be condemned  to<br>
destruction for his evil ways.  Self-righteous hypocrites.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is it His design for any to have homosexual tendencies?  I say No (cf. Rom 1).</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps not, but apparently, a lot of people do.  We should avoid persecuting,<br>
and try comforting.  Don't tell them what Scripture says, invite them to find out<br>
for themselves, and find what peace they may.  Let God be their judge, not us.<br>
We do not know all of His plan, only what has been revealed to us in His Word,<br>
and His word was, after all, written down by human hands, subject to the failings<br>
of us all.  As has been said before, Scripture does not claim infallibilty for<br>
Itself.  The only words which -must- be infallible are those of our Lord Himself,<br>
who told us to love each other, and who reproaches us to not worry about the mote<br>
in another's eye until we have removed the beam from our own.  Words to live by...<br>

RE: sharing creationism<br>
<p>
     In my work in the nuclear physics community I have been quite<br>
reticent to emphasize creation research as my major job<br>
responsibility. To tell people that I am a creationist I would<br>
compare to Christ telling people that He was the Messiah. Desire of<br>
Ages, p.414. says --- Jesus charged the disciples to tell no man<br>
that He was the Christ. This charge was given because of the<br>
determined opposition of the scribes and Pharisees. More than this,<br>
the people, and even the disciples, had so false a conception of<br>
the Messiah that a public announcement of Him would give them no<br>
true idea of His character or His work. But day by day He was<br>
revealing Himself to them as the Saviour, and thus He desired to<br>
give them a true conception of Him as the Messiah.    The ideas<br>
that scientists envision when they hear the term creationism is<br>
rather distant from my beliefs.<br>
     Plenty of scientists ask me about my job. My response is that<br>
I am studying the relation between science and religion. The first<br>
two weeks in July I spent working on a kaon scattering experiment<br>
at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, NY. This last<br>
Saturday night I was talking to one of the graduate students<br>
helping with the experiment. It started with a question about my<br>
job. He spent awhile asking me what the SDA church believes, and<br>
finished by saying that he wished that he too could believe.<br>
Emphasizing the creation/evolution controversy that evening would<br>
have put up a barrier and directed his interest away from the<br>
essentials.<br>
     There are a number of examples of Christ avoiding controversy.<br>
(He didn't always but it seems there are more examples of avoiding<br>
than confronting.) The woman at the well hoped to silence<br>
conviction by turning to points of religious controversy (where to<br>
worship), but Jesus wanted to lift her thoughts above matters of<br>
form and ceremony, and questions of controversy (see John 4 and DA<br>
p.188). Thomas made his doubts prominent, but Jesus didn't<br>
overwhelm him with reproach, nor did He enter into controversy with<br>
him. He revealed Himself. Thomas was unreasonable in dictating the<br>
conditions of his faith, but Jesus broke down the barriers by His<br>
generous love and consideration. Unbelief is seldom overcome by<br>
controversy. It is rather put upon self-defence, and finds new<br>
support and excuse. Instead Jesus needs to be revealed (see John 20<br>
and DA p.808).<br>
     However, having said all that, the evolution/creation issue<br>
does need to be addressed at some point in sharing Christianity<br>
with a scientist. The standard evolutionary model is THE scientific<br>
model. It has the most evidence in the literature because that is<br>
the paradigm under which most scientists work. One would have no<br>
reason to consider another type of model except that the Bible<br>
presents a different model. Of course there is always the<br>
possibility that we have misconceptions about exactly what the<br>
Bible is trying to say about early earth history events. My<br>
approach then is to determine what the important themes throughout<br>
the Bible are and see how they are related to Genesis 1-11. These<br>
themes include: life isn't meaningless, God has a purpose; life<br>
doesn't improve on its own, we need outside help; evil is not<br>
normal or just; death and suffering are not part of God's preferred<br>
plan for development; God does intervene in non-scientific ways at<br>
times; God demands our worship because He is Creator; the Sabbath<br>
memorializes a seven day creation week; the NT authors interpret<br>
Genesis 1-11 as literal, etc. There have been unjustifiable science<br>
theories based on interpretation of individual texts, e.g., a<br>
flat earth, a geocentric universe, fixity of species. However, the<br>
themes I mentioned in general are related to the overall thrust of<br>
the Bible in the Great Controversy and concerning our salvation. I<br>
have not seen a model that is able to include these themes without<br>
also including a recent 6-day creation of life and a catastrophic<br>
widespread flood.<br>
     With that in mind I need to again look at the scientific<br>
evidence. What would I share with a skeptic? In the history of<br>
science, the theories aren't quite as final as may seem apparent at<br>
any one point in time in their development. The perfect wave theory<br>
of light of 100 years ago has had to go through some rather major<br>
revolutions (relativity and quantum mechanics). The simple<br>
classical mechanics theories are now being re-examined under new<br>
developments in chaos theory. Plate tectonics, laughed at 50 years<br>
ago, is now the accepted paradigm. And catastrophism is becoming<br>
much more acceptable in geology these days, e.g. an extra-<br>
terrestrial impact causing the extinction of the dinosaurs.<br>
     Enough creation type research is finding alternative<br>
explanations to standard evolution to suggest that it is not as<br>
unreasonable as some may think. (If people are interested I could<br>
give examples of some specifics, but I think I have said about<br>
enough for one posting.) However, one should not expect that<br>
naturalistic science will ever come up with supernatural<br>
intervention as an explanation for origins. Scientists feel that<br>
would be going back to the Middle Ages where anything you don't<br>
understand is attributed to God, thus stifling personal research.<br>

I recently had a Sabbath dinner discussion with a group of people who are open<br>
about their homosexuality and are also active SDA's.  At the table were three<br>
of us who were "straight" (two male and one female) and five who were not (four<br>
male and one female).  A few of these individuals are very active in the Kinship<br>
organization and since this court ruling against the General Conference had<br>
recently passed, a large part of our discussion centered on Kinship and where<br>
they would go from here.<br>
<p>
I came to form the following opinions based on these few hours of interaction.<br>
<p>
These people are just the same as all my "straight" friends.  They have work<br>
problems, they have relationship problems, they joke, they laugh, and actually<br>
enjoy talking about things other than homosexuality.  In short, I generally<br>
don't think of them as "these people" but rather as my friends.  I also found<br>
that they have a great deal of concern about their (the SDA) church and where<br>
they can fit into organization.<br>
<p>
Comparing homosexuality to alcoholism is something I used to do but I have a<br>
hard time thinking that way now.  During my last year in school at Andrews (I<br>
work here now) there were two situations that started building a contrast in<br>
my mind.  I had one friend who was very active in student government that was<br>
discovered to be involved in a homosexual relationship with another student.<br>
He had his student leadership positions removed and was subsequently expelled<br>
from school.  At the same time I had a student (I was teaching a freshman<br>
level class) who had a car accident, was found to be under the influence of <br>
alcohol, and was the first student to enter an alcohol rehab program that<br>
had just been started at AU.  Both situations were commonly known, I think<br>
most of the things I outlined here were even in the student paper on campus.<br>
I realized at that time that we have radically different approaches as a<br>
school and as a denomination to dealing with these two situations.<br>
Back to my Sabbath dinner.  I did not sense from any of my homosexual friends<br>
that they consider their homosexuality as a problem.  I can't say that I'm<br>
sure they do have a problem (I'm still forming a personal opinion on this)<br>
even in light of all of the "proof texts" that I know exist to condemn this<br>
lifestyle.<br>
<p>
To the issue of celibacy.  What if two SDA men wanted to get married?  If they<br>
could get past the legal issues, would the church allow them to be members?<br>
Would their sexual activity after this marriage still be "adultery" even<br>
though they have gone through this act of commitment?  Should the church make<br>
this a litmus test as we seem to do with smoking? Or, should we let God worry<br>
about whether or not they're sinning and we accept them as they are because in<br>
fact, "all have sinned and come short of the glory of God"?<br>
<p>
These are not necessarily my opinions, my opinions tend to change as time goes<br>
by, but I thought these anecdotes might help add a different slant to the<br>
discussions.<br>

The following is part of today's daily stock quotes and news<br>
clips that I daily receive internally here at work. This especially<br>
caught my attention, particularly the last statement about Jesus. <br>
Anyone have more information about it? <br>
<p>
"Clinton was on VISN (a religious network) this weekend to talk about<br>
family values but it rapidly degenerated into a discussion of<br>
establishment religion.  Clinton was asked how he could be for<br>
capital punishment if the Bible taught respect for human life, for<br>
example.  He said that it had been hard to let four people be<br>
executed while he was governor, but not much more.  No one has the<br>
courage to ask how one can justify war but that would probably be impolite.<br>
He was also asked about the Supreme Court decision on prayer at<br>
public assemblies at schools.  This was done where Clinton went<br>
to school but he agreed that the separation of church and state<br>
probably required this decision.  On the other hand, since Jesus told<br>
his disciples never to pray in public and roundly critised anyone<br>
that prayed out loud, maybe the Supreme Court did establish religion."<br>
<p>

God bless, Joanne Figueiredo<br>

<i>&gt; Hi Glen in ref to your EMail, are you sure that Homosexuality can be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; genetic defect. If so, we can excuse a lot of things.</i><br>
<p>
I am not in favor of homosexual practices at all.  My point was that<br>
we take a lot of things for granted -- so long as they don't affect us<br>
personally.  For example, we might condemn homosexuals, but how many<br>
of us are temperate in other ways?  I have been in SDA subcultures<br>
where people would stuff themselves at Sabbath lunch and lie in a<br>
stupor the rest of the day.  This is no more temperate than other<br>
practices we strongly condemn.<br>
<p>
I think in too many cases we confuse our personal willpower with<br>
strength given by God.  I've been reading Philip Yancey's book<br>
"Disappointment with God" and it stirs the pot a bit on these issues.<br>
He talks about people who talk loudly about their prayer life and all<br>
that God has done for them, and then about people who are just as<br>
sincere but whom God doesn't seem to answer.<br>
<p>
I think that SDAnet readers by and large are well above average in<br>
intelligence, education, and so on.  I also think there is a twilight<br>
world out there of people in just the opposite position.  I'm not<br>
totally convinced that our standard theological approaches apply to<br>
them.<br>

Some time ago I commented on SDAnet that there was irony in the fact<br>
that those North Americans who strongly favor racial unity in South <br>
African churches are the same ones who support separate conferences<br>
and unions for Blacks in North America.<br>
<p>
I have since read the Spectrum article describing that meeting, and<br>
what I have called a fact is not a fact at all.  In fact, Calvin Rock,<br>
African-American VP of the church, who chaired the meeting, was one of <br>
the major voices urging caution and not forcing the unions and conferences<br>
of S. Africa to integrate before they were ready.<br>
<p>
I apologize for my error and the storm it caused, causing one member to <br>
leave the list.<br>

Paul Gates spoke against the idea of regarding homosexuality as a genetic<br>
influence, because by this rationality we could excuse all sorts of behavior.<br>
Actually I was the one that put forth that position for the sake of argument.<br>
My point was that even if there is a genetic component to this condition, <br>
that does not make it excusable, or irreversible.  Although I compared<br>
homosexuality to alcoholism, I didn't mean to suggest that it is a<br>
disease.<br>
It is, however, an alleged genetic condition from which recovery is<br>
possible and necessary.  It's no more or less a disease than any other<br>
sin.<br>
<p>
However, in the Adventist church, there seem to be two levels of sin.<br>
You don't see anyone get disfellowshipped for pride, covetousness, <br>
greed, backbiting, gossip, politicking, or many other sins.  When it <br>
comes to the so-called "public" sins, condemnation is more at the ready <br>
for pregancy out of wedlock, adultery, divorce, and homosexuality. <br>
(Although this condemnation, too, is disappearing, replaced by the I'm<br>
OK, You're OK philosophy.)<br>
<p>
When I was writing my still-to-be-accepted book manuscript, I struggled <br>
with what to say about homosexuality, because there was nothing in my <br>
relationship-theology development of the relationship between lovers to<br>
indicate that this should always be between male and female.  I decided<br>
at that time to say nothing about it.  Now I don't have that luxury.<br>
<p>
This topic can't be treated without recognizing that in Genesis God<br>
created the image of God as a relationship between man and woman, and<br>
that the image of God is only realized in relationships.  The logical<br>
extensions of that argument, however, give pause for thought.  If we are<br>
to accept the<br>
Bible's prohibitions against homosexuality at face value [which I believe<br>
we must] how can we ignore the nearby counsels on the role of women<br>
which we would dearly love to argue were culture-bound?  How, indeed,<br>
can we develop a moral theology that is any different from the "natural<br>
theology" of the Catholic Church?  Or should we?<br>
<p>
This whole issue begs the question of what the role in general the human<br>
body plays in Adventist theology.  Here we find some delicious<br>
ambiguities.<br>
I don't remember if I have posted them before.  If so, someone please<br>
warn me, otherwise you will see them soon.<br>

I think it is imperative to separate the issue of promiscuity from that<br>
of sexual orientation.  I know plenty of heterosexuals who proposition<br>
their friends -- this is NOT a phenomenon limited to homosexuals!<br>
Promiscuity is condemned no matter what your orientation, I believe<br>
we could all agree on that point.<br>
<p>
Now, as for genetic basis for homosexuality.  What if it IS genetically<br>
based, not like mental retardation or alcoholism, but more like being<br>
left-handed?  Do we cure lefties?  We used to try and it caused no end<br>
of trouble for the poor kids.  What would be the attitude of the church<br>
then?  I think I can predict that there would be a major split with one<br>
side claiming that all the condemnation of homosexuality in the Bible<br>
still applied even to loving monogamous relationships, and the other side<br>
saying that a lot of the Biblical injunctions were culturally based and<br>
would not apply to homosexual marriage.<br>
<p>
Personally, I'm suspending judgement, as we are all enjoined to do anyway!<br>
I have had gay friends who were indeed in traumatic circumstances because<br>
of their feelings of guilt and fear of what the church would say should<br>
they live with someone of the same gender.  They were in no way "wicked"<br>
people, in the way that some of my heterosexual but predatory acquaintances<br>
seem to me to be "wicked."  But there iI go, judging the heterosexuals!<br>
It's a hard habit to break...<br>

Lola articulated a point of view commonly heard in arguments of this type<br>
<p>
"It's not for us to judge."<br>
<p>
While the verses in the Bible that speak against judging are many,<br>
including Matthew 7, there are also pro-judging verses in the Bible.<br>
First Corinthians 5:12,13, 6:2,3<br>
<p>
"For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?  do not ye<br>
judge them that are within?  But them that are without God judgeth. <br>
therefore put away from yourselves that wicked person.  <br>
Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?  And if the world<br>
shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? <br>
Know ye not that we shall judge angels?  how much more things that<br>
pertain to this life?<br>
<p>
<p>
If we look at the first few chapters of Acts, we see that judgment<br>
happened frequently, and God's authority was exercised in the church. <br>
If we think that the church today can run without rules to govern the<br>
behavior of its members, we are only deceiving ourselves.  <br>
<p>
The key difference between then and now is that at that time the church<br>
authorities were under the clear, present, and daily guidance of the<br>
Holy Spirit.  Only under this influence can we hope to judge fairly. <br>
But once<br>
given this power, judge we can and judge we must.<br>

The Mormons point to the body as an essential part of the trip from spirit<br>
world through life to exaltation.  The Christian Scientists believe that<br>
the mistake Adam made was not in eating the fruit, but falling asleep and <br>
dreaming he had a body in the first place, and that we are deluded into <br>
believing we have one, as soon as we clear ourselves of this delusion,<br>
we'll be free.<br>
<p>
Adventists would generally not accept either of the above extremes.<br>
But for years the care or neglect of ones body is one of the category of <br>
"visible sins" which has served as a yardstick for the self-righteous.  <br>
(Unfortunately, the emphasis on health seems to be slipping just as the <br>
rest of the world is realizing that we were right.)  <br>
<p>
Bull and Lockhart in _Seeking A Sanctuary_ claim that the central<br>
sociological tension of Adventists as a group is the conflict between<br>
two images.  One as the model minority, practicing good health, doing<br>
all sorts<br>
of humanitarian activities, and being a model to the country,.  The<br>
other as the peculiar minority:  who are different and enjoy the<br>
difference, and emphasize their status as a peculiar and oppressed<br>
people.<br>
<p>
The question to be answered is the following:  Our church says a lot<br>
about caring for ones' body.  But what is, or should be, our motivation<br>
to do so?<br>
<p>
1)  Salvation by Numete<br>
2)  To live longer and happier on this earth<br>
3)  To make the time on earth *seem* longer<br>
4)  To deny and mortify self, punishing our animal passions<br>
5)  To make our church the best health club around<br>
6)  To look really sexy to attract others to our church<br>
7)  To keep our channels to God open the best they can<br>
8)  Others?  Add yours<br>
<p>
<p>
Bull and Lockhart also reported in their book that in advertising in SDA<br>
publications, female images were used more than male over the past few<br>
years by a factor of 3 or 4 to 1.  Why's that?  Is it appropriate to use<br>
a pretty face to sell a holy product?  (I think yes, it gets me every<br>
time.)<br>

Hi Folks:<br>
<p>
It's been a while, but that is how work goes!!<br>
<p>
I've followed with some interest the discussion on homosexuality, and<br>
I would like to make a few points.  First, if we accept the Bible as<br>
the inspired Word of God to us, then we must also accept that God will<br>
protect His Word so that we have it today.  This means that the<br>
proscription against homosexuality in both the OT and NT still apply<br>
today.  Either God is right, or He isn't God at all.<br>
<p>
The problem is not sexual orientation or sexual sins but our sin<br>
nature.  That is, our propensity to sin.  Since Adam and Eve ate the<br>
forbidden fruit, humanity has consistently tried to impose its own<br>
view of right and wrong, good and evil, upon each other and God.  <br>
<p>
When those who accept the full weight and import of Scripture make<br>
statements based on what God says, they are accused of judging.  As<br>
one who accepts God's judgements of right and wrong, good and evil,<br>
let me say that when I condemn homosexual practices I am not judging<br>
-- I am merely repeating what God has caused to be written in His<br>
Word.  God said it and that is sufficient.  I seriously doubt that God<br>
would have condemned something that was genetically passed on to<br>
humans.  I don't believe that homosexuality is genetically based.<br>
<p>
Now having said all that let me move on to what I believe is what Gad<br>
calls us to do.  While we are supposed to call sin sin, we are also<br>
supposed to let the Love of God shine through us.  If we go around all<br>
the time condemning others for their sins, we will miss our own sins.<br>
A homosexual is no more vile than any other sinner -- sin is sin is<br>
sin!!  There is forgiveness and restoration for all who come to Christ<br>
Jesus.  I personally know of two homosexuals who not only came to<br>
Christ, but their conversions were accompanied with the miraculous --<br>
that is, they found their sexual orientations changed.  One is now<br>
dead of AIDS that he contracted prior to coming to Christ, but his<br>
family (wife and two kids) are still free of the disease to this day.<br>
The other person is now attending seminary to become a minister of the<br>
Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br>
<p>
I also know of other sinners who at conversion had the miraculous<br>
happen in their lives, as well.  And that is the whole point -- the<br>
conversion of sinners from darkness to light, from death to life, from<br>
sin to righteousness.  That is what Christianity is about, that is the<br>
calling of the Church universal.  Was it not our Lord's final charge<br>
to us to go into all the world and preach the Gospel, making<br>
disciples!?  Were we not also told that the Gospel would be an offense<br>
to many!?  The world does not want the absolute morality of God.  They<br>
want the relativistic morality of our archenemy.  Yet, we who follow<br>
Christ are the modern day equivalents of the old prophets!  We are to<br>
stand before the world and call the world to repentance in Jesus<br>
Christ, and this means that we must also call the people's sins sin in<br>
the sight of God.<br>
<p>
Just my thoughts on things.<br>
<p>
En Agape,<br>
<p>
Gene Gross<br>

Problem is, people judge others whether or not the Holy Spirit is guiding<br>
them.  Judging behavior is one thing.  Judging -people- is something else.<br>
Usually, it is a simple matter to judge the actions of another to be wrong.<br>
However, judging the inherent worth and/or righteousness of the wrongdoer<br>
is something else entirely.  If you accept that you are a sinful person, <br>
that you have your own failings in the eyes of the Lord, then you have -no-<br>
right -whatsoever- to judge another person as unrighteous.  What makes <br>
your sins of less import than theirs?  What makes you more righteous than<br>
them?  Perhaps they are looking at you and, seeing your sins, judging you<br>
as well.<br>
<p>
Paul wrote that it was okay to judge.  -Jesus- said not to.  Given that<br>
apparent conflict, it is easy for me to decide whose words to follow. <br>

I figured I'd jump in on this one, even though I'm not an SDA.<br>
<p>
I've spent some time working this issue through, starting about <br>
2 years ago.  I had allowed my physical condition to degenerate, <br>
using my spare time for more "spiritual activities" such as <br>
Bible study and fellowship.  God needed to overcome an inaccurate<br>
philosophy of mine, one that had developed subconsciously over<br>
the years where I thought of physical health activities as <br>
"vanities" of "those jock types" or "health nuts."<br>
<p>
The bottom line for me theologically is twofold:<br>
<p>
	1) Just as we are to view ourselves as merely stewards<br>
	   (not owners) of our financial resources, so we are to <br>
	   view our bodies as gifts of God that we are entrusted <br>
	   to manage wisely.  We are neither to obsess over our <br>
	   physiques, nor are we to squandor them.  (All the classic <br>
	   passages on stewardship apply.)<br>
<p>
	   So, for instance, when I realize that my back is such <br>
	   that I must swim regularly to avoid weakening it and <br>
	   precipitating injury, I would be foolish not to do so.<br>
<p>
	2) As a husband, it is part of my ministry to keep a<br>
	   sufficiently attractive body that my physical relationship<br>
	   with my wife is not inhibited.  To do otherwise would<br>
	   not be loving my wife, but rather being selfishly lazy.  <br>
<p>
	   Also, as a corollary of the first point, to let myself<br>
	   degenerate to the point that I'm risking serious injury<br>
	   (back problems) or death (heart attack), is also not<br>
	   serving my wife.<br>
<p>
These two points helped me to put this area of my life into<br>
perspective.<br>
<p>
Just my $.02 worth,<br>
Mark<br>

Steve, Amen to all of your comments on judging. I feel that this is a good<br>
time to redeem myself! In the past I have probably given some the idea<br>
that I am totally against all rules and regulations. I really am not! I do<br>
not like to see Christian people put 100% of their focus on rules. By so<br>
doing we lock ourselves in and cannot be free in Jesus Christ. EGW<br>
referring to schools gives us the idea that rules should be few and well<br>
thought out. In our Jr. Academy close by in my area for this coming year<br>
we have deleted all rules on dress code and established one statement as<br>
far as dress is concerned.<br>
<p>
One case in point, a couple who live in our area recently had a new born.<br>
The husband is a former SDA, and his parents are members of our church.<br>
His wife has a catholic background. I have explained to them about Child<br>
dedication and the responsibility of Christian parents in training the<br>
child. The couple wanted to know if it was alright for the Head Elder to<br>
do the dedication service since the wife had worked for him in the past. I<br>
readily gave my approval. When contacted the head elder refused without<br>
giving them any explanation. Because they are not church members he<br>
doesn't feel that it is proper. He has a right to his views. I will be<br>
dedicating the child tomorrow at church. I believe that is an example of<br>
what can happy when we focus completely on rules.<br>
<p>
The example in the Ministry magazine a few months back is proper at this<br>
point. In a framed picture of Christ, Christ is the focal point the frame<br>
is the doctrines!<br>
<p>
It would appear to me, Steve, that the bottom line of this "thread" is:<br>
SIN IS SIN WHEREVER WE FIND IT. It seems to be less sin if we have the<br>
problem. It is really sin if that sin is not a problem with us.<br>
<p>
A good share of us if not all of us have tendencies to certain sins. On a<br>
very hot day some times I get the thought of how good would a cold glass<br>
of beer taste?!! I quickly dismiss it and think that I overcame that 39<br>
years ago and I certainly do not want to mess my life up with that sort<br>
of thing when I have learned to live without it.<br>
<p>
any comments anybody??<br>
<p>

  Yes, sex does sell.  Must be why those ancient eastern religions had<br>
temple prostitues?  But it isn't the right thing to do.<br>

Steve, Appreciated your thoughts on health. The lifestyle that I live<br>
comes from the idea that I want to live to be 100 years old if time lasts<br>
and I want to be in the very best of health. If I can glorify Jesus Christ<br>
in the process I am happy. I want to have a clear mind and be able to<br>
discern spiritual things.<br>
<p>
We used to at Michigan Campmeeting purchase $200.00 worth of what we used<br>
to call "health foods." My wife and I have both lowered our cholesterol<br>
when we gave them up! We discovered for ourselves that eating meat was<br>
almost more healthy than eating the so called analogs. Occasionally we do<br>
eat a choplet or a hot dog when our grandchildren are over for a visit.<br>
But, usually never keep them in the house.<br>
<p>
Sadly but true, the SDA church has lost it as far as health is concerned<br>
in my humble opinion. I have more confidence in Dr. Gabe Merkin of<br>
Washington, DC's WRC radio talk show, and / or Dr. McDougall. SDAs are<br>
seemingly getting on the bandwagon now that the world is promoting<br>
healthful living. <br>
<p>
I have lost 31 pounds since Sept. of last year and have about the same<br>
amount again to go and I give all the glory to fruits, vegetables, beans,<br>
whole grains, etc.<br>
<p>
I very rarely eat cheese except the kind made with 100% skim milk, very<br>
rarely eat an egg, ( we use egg beaters ) and drink skim or 1% milk. I<br>
want to continue to have a healthy body because that is what God designed<br>
and wants me to have.  (3John v.2) My reasons for living healthy do not<br>
stem from having a "guilt trip" via the SDA church. My focus is what God<br>
says in his word. I take full responsibility for my obesity but it was<br>
listening to the so called health reformists in the church that I found<br>
my self 61 years old and almost a health hazard. Please do not give me<br>
the report that Adventists live longer -- let's do another report and see<br>
what the data really is! I will be eternally grateful for Dr. Merkin here<br>
in the DC area and Dr. McDougall (non SDA) at our hospital in Calif.<br>
(forgot name of SDA hosp. where McDougall is now). I believe Weimar<br>
Institute has done a lot for SDAs to get on track health wise. I would not<br>
mind going out there to get my weight under control but can't afford it.<br>
<p>
Steve, I am not a health fanatic. My lifestyle is good for me and I do not<br>
try to force it on other people.  <br>
<p>
Take care Steve, appreciate your insights.<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Paul&gt;&gt;<br>

I may have posted this story before to the net, but if so it was a long<br>
time ago:<br>
<p>
Those who have been Adventists for a while will remember the book<br>
_Creeping Compromise_ by Joe Crews.  In it he recounts a story of a<br>
sermon he gave at an academy, warning the young people to abstain from<br>
many modern vices including (gasp!) mixed swimming.  He recalls that<br>
afterwards two young <br>
ladies came up to him, evidently troubled.  "We were on the boardwalk,<br>
at the beach, witnessing all summer.  This is our friend Tom, who has<br>
come to know the Lord as a result of our witness."<br>
<p>
Joe Crews asked Tom, "Were you influenced by the attractiveness of these<br>
young ladies and the provocative attire they were wearing?" <br>
"Yes, of course," Tom replied.<br>
<p>
Crews ends the episode by saying that the young ladies were shocked that<br>
their attire would have influenced Tom, and uses the episode to build<br>
his case against the evils of mixed swimming, whether or not people are<br>
clothed in costumes which he considers modest.  But I've wondered ever<br>
since:<br>
<p>
1)  Was it better that Tom not come to know God at all than be attracted<br>
with the wrong motive?<br>
<p>
2)  If only pure motives were accepted in the initial seeking of God,<br>
would any of us ever find God?<br>
<p>
3)  I do not claim that the end justifies the means, but is there some time<br>
when the display of the human form is appropriate and holy, even if<br>
there is a chance it may be misunderstood?<br>
<p>
4)  What would Jesus do in a situation like this?  Wear a 3-piece suit <br>
to the beach?<br>
<p>
5)  Just because Jesus could do the appropriate thing in a situation,<br>
does that mean we necessarily can or should do it?<br>
<p>
6)  Is it time to have the "La Sierra Bikini Team" and make beach<br>
witnessing into a recognized intercollegiate sport?<br>
<p>
7)  Whenever a witnessing approach involves meeting someone on their<br>
level, there is a certain amount of tempation involved both for the<br>
witness and the witnessee.  How do we know how much is too much?<br>
<p>
Some of my questions are tongue-in-cheek, some of them are deadly serious.<br>
I hope you all can tell the difference.<br>

This is some information taken from a position paper presented by Len <br>
McMillan at the meeting of the Association Of Adventist Family Life <br>
Professionals at Andrews University this month.<br>
<p>
According to Christianity Today, the percentage of clergy at large<br>
who admitted to some sexually inappropriate activity is 25%.  One<br>
out of eight admit to having commited adultery.<br>
<p>
A group of 586 respondents who answered McMillan's questionnaire at his <br>
seminar for pastors and associated caregivers gave some interesting <br>
pictures of the Adventist community.<br>
<p>
50% of males and 47% of the females in this group had engaged in<br>
premarital sex.  Those who had grown up in Adventist homes had<br>
significantly less<br>
p[ercentage than this.<br>
<p>
11% of males and 10% of females had had sex with someone other than<br>
their spouse than since marriage [note this does not imply they were<br>
necessarily in the ministry at that time.]  For those that grew up in<br>
Adventist homes<br>
the percentage is 12%.<br>
<p>
65% of males and 31% of females admitted to being sexually attracted to<br>
a parishoner or student without actually engaging in sex.<br>
 <br>
47% would not feel comfortable talking to their spouse about such an<br>
attraction.<br>
<p>
10% of pastors admitted to having an affair.  16% of the females at <br>
the event, which included pastors wives, teachers, and counselors,<br>
admitted to an affair.<br>
<p>
6% of the males and 19% of the females said they were sexually abused <br>
as children.  Among those from Adventist homes male and female,<br>
the figure was 8% as opposed to 18% from non-religious homes.<br>

Since I never post but read SDAnet regularly... I thought I'd just <br>
write and say thanks to Steve for his efforts as moderater as well as <br>
acknowledge his ability to foster stimulating discussion on topics of <br>
interest and importance.... Thanx!<br>
<p>
Of recent interest to me I have a couple of questions for those with <br>
some further insight. <br>
<p>
Recently an SDA friend of mine met, became engaged and married <br>
within 8 months.  There are a number of things about this union <br>
which concern me besides the shortness of the courtship but the one <br>
which troubles me most is her decision to marry outside her faith, <br>
not just outside SDA but outside Christianity to a converted <br>
practicing Moslem.<br>
<p>
So here are my questions related to this topic:<br>
<p>
How does the church relate to a young adult who chooses to date <br>
someone outside their particular church faith (i.e. non-SDA)?  What <br>
principles are there to guide the individual and the church in relating <br>
to that individual?<br>
<p>
Was it Biblically wrong for my friend to marry a non-Christian?  Is <br>
she lost in some way by her decision?  If so how does the church <br>
relate to her now?  (Needless to say, a once regular member, she has <br>
not returned to church since the wedding, embittered by the peoples <br>
and pastoral response.)<br>

<p>
Absolutely.  1Kings 11:1-11; 2Cor. 6:14-18.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is she lost in some way by her decision?</i><br>
<p>
I take the minority position that one can not lose his salvation<br>
(Rom. 8:35-39).  However, I think her decision says rather<br>
loudly that she is not saved.  How can you choose an earthly<br>
lord who denies the deity of your heavenly Lord?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If so how does the church relate to her now?</i><br>
<p>
This is very difficult.  Paul asks, "What will ye?  Shall I come<br>
unto you with a rod or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"<br>
(1Cor. 4:21)  Those in Corinth had to choose; so did your friend.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (Needless to say, a once regular member, she has </i><br>
<i>&gt; not returned to church since the wedding, embittered by the peoples </i><br>
<i>&gt; and pastoral response.)</i><br>
<p>
It is, indeed, sad when a disciple turns back and no more walks<br>
with Jesus.  I believe this is a matter of a leopard showing its<br>
true spots.  I recommend you John 6:59-66, especially verse 64.<br>
Whereas we can judge only by a person's walk, God is not so limited.<br>
<p>

<p>
Nice to hear from you Alice.<br>

To Whoever is listening:<br>
 <br>
There is a good friend of mine here who is having trouble with anger.<br>
He apparently does not express it but keeps it inside. He has talked to<br>
me about this, and expresses the fear that he may sometime lose control<br>
over his stored anger. In that event he might do just about anything. He<br>
has asked me for advice on how he can release it safely, without hurting<br>
anyone or anything. I have suggested physical exercise, but this is <br>
apparently not enough. I am no expert in situations such as this, so I<br>
seek helpful advice from anyone who may have wisdom to share.<br>

<i>&gt;        There is a good friend of mine here who is having</i><br>
<i>&gt;    trouble with anger.  He apparently does not express it but</i><br>
<i>&gt;    keeps it inside.  He has talked to me about this, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;    expresses the fear that he may sometime lose control over</i><br>
<i>&gt;    his stored anger.  In that event he might do just about</i><br>
<i>&gt;    anything.  He has asked me for advice on how he can release</i><br>
<i>&gt;    it safely, without hurting anyone or anything.  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;    suggested physical exercise, but this is apparently not</i><br>
<i>&gt;    enough.  I am no expert in situations such as this, so I</i><br>
<i>&gt;    seek helpful advice from anyone who may have wisdom to</i><br>
<i>&gt;    share.</i><br>
 <br>
     I would never want to suggest that there is a 2 minute answer<br>
   to this problem.  You may want to find out what the source of<br>
   the anger is.  It sounds like this person needs to talk their<br>
   anger out.  Perhaps meet with a professional counselor.  But I<br>
   would exersize caution if seeking a counselor.  If its the wrong<br>
   type of counselor, it may even backfire.  Perhaps you may want to<br>
   explain to this person that by allowing the anger to build, they<br>
   put themselves in jeopardy.  You may want to find out if this<br>
   person is harboring bitterness.  If so, they need to be freed from<br>
   it to experience joy in the Lord.<br>
   My little 2c<br>

I don't think numbers are important.  Three is also used to mean "a<br>
few".  I respectfully suggest that to make calculations about how long<br>
a man could survive inside a whale misses the point of the book.<br>

On Fri, 29 May 1992 10:22:42 -0400 (EDT) you said:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;From the keyboard of "Edward W. Fargusson" &lt;uunet!compuserve.com!72450.2430&gt;:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I believe the use of "High Sabbath" refers to when a ceremonial sabbath falls</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;on the seventh-day sabbath. Whenever two sabbaths fell on the same day it was</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;referred to as a "High Sabbath." This might refer to the beginning of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;feast of unleavened bread falling on the seventh-day sabbath.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Ed Fargusson @ Compuserve: 72450,2430</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But then you negate the OT prophecy that the messiah would be cut</i><br>
<i>&gt;off in the the midst of the week and the NT prophecy that the</i><br>
<p>
  Do you refer to Daniel here?  That was all my quick search found about<br>
Messiah being cut off.  According to my KJV the Messiah will be cut off<br>
after threescore and 2 weeks.  Also that he will confirm the convenant<br>
with many for one week and in the midst of that week he will cause the<br>
sacrifice and oblation to cease.  Assuming that you meant the latter and<br>
just used the formers words, I thought the SDA church was big on the<br>
days being years and so this put mean that after 3.5 years he died, not<br>
that he was crucified on Wed.<br>
<p>
  That just brought up an interesting question for me.  Though I think I<br>
know the answer, if Messiah was confirming the convenant for 7 and his<br>
death was 3.5 years into that, with whom was he confirming the covenant<br>
after his death/resurrection?  (Dan 9:27).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;messiah would be in the heart of the earth 3 days and 3 nights.</i><br>
<p>
  For this reason, and what is recorded about the first day of the week<br>
being when his disciples found out, I lean towards either Wed or<br>
Thursday.  I prefer the Wed date the most, but Thur came up due to the<br>
discussion about Jewish days and all.<br>
<p>
  But, and I am serious here, does it matter for salvation?<br>

Hi Dave:<br>
<p>
There are a number of words that the Greeks used for love -- some more<br>
akin to the English term "like" than our word "love."  However, I want<br>
to confine my remarks to eros, phileo, and agape.<br>
<p>
Eros, from which we get our word erotic, is the sensual love.  It is<br>
neither good or bad.  We get great sensual pleasure out of a beautiful<br>
vista (and there are definitely some in Dave's neck of the woods!!).<br>
The negative side of this is the lust of the flesh often seen in what<br>
is sometimes called erotica, or just plain pornography (soft and<br>
hard).<br>
<p>
Phileo, from which the name Philadelphia comes, is the brotherly or<br>
familial love.  It is neither good nor bad.  Phileo is not necessarily<br>
a selfless type of love, either.  It is basically, "I love you because<br>
of what you do for me, or because of what I am when I'm with you."  In<br>
the discourse between the Risen Christ and Peter, Jesus asks Peter<br>
twice if Peter loves Him with an agape type love.  Peter responds with<br>
(paraphrased), "Yes, Lord, I phileo You."  Finally, Jesus asked him if<br>
he did love Him with a "phileo" love.  And it is at this point I want<br>
to stop for a moment.<br>
<p>
There is a uniqueness about what we as Christians are called to with<br>
respect to love.  The word agape is used consistently for the type of<br>
love we are called to.  Yet, often, our love is in the phileo stage,<br>
and so remains for a long time in some cases.  I don't know that this<br>
presents a problem -- initially.  But we must all yield to the Spirit<br>
if we are ever to grow beyond simply phileo.  Agape love conveys the<br>
sense of love without reason or strings attached.  I don't know too<br>
many people who show this sort of love, even inside the many churches<br>
of Christianity.  It is a rare commodity.<br>
<p>
Yet, it need not be so.  Phileo can, and should, lead to agape.  As He<br>
loved (agape), so we should love (agape) others.  And initially, it<br>
will start as phileo.  But by teaching the disciples of Christ what is<br>
meant by the love that Jesus calls us to, they will then have<br>
something to model.<br>
<p>
The arguments in the churches seems to come from the fact that the<br>
love of many is a base sort of love.  It is self-centered love (see 1<br>
Cor. 13 for more on this subject).  Those who are spiritual elders in<br>
the Faith need to exhibit agape, in as much as is possible for them as<br>
mere humans.  It is on the shoulders of the elders of the Faith that<br>
the task of discipling and leading falls, and if the congregants of a<br>
church are at war, then where must we start with the repairs and<br>
healing!?  <br>
<p>
Elders, please look to your own lives for a moment and examine<br>
yourselves as to the love you show in your dealings with the other<br>
saints about you.  What level of love are you presenting to them to<br>
model?  What level of love are you teaching them both in word and<br>
deed?  And this is not to sound pompous nor self-righteous for the<br>
Lord knows well, as do I, that I fail in this myself.  But we have a<br>
heavy task placed upon us -- to whom much is given, much is required.<br>
<p>
I know this does not directly address Dave's posting, but I hope it<br>
helps some.<br>
<p>
BTW, Dave, PRAISE GOD!!  He has saved your position yet again!<br>
<p>
En Agape,<br>
<p>

Here is a quote from the Desire of Ages (page 145) on a mother's pride. It is<br>
in relation to Mary at the feast of Cana:<br>
 <br>
   "As Mary had heard the disciples' testimony in regard to Jesus, she had been<br>
   gladdened with the assurance that her long-cherished hopes were not in vain.<br>
   Yet she would have been more than human if there had not mingled with this<br>
   joy a trace of the fond mother's natural pride."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
This doesn't seem to be particularly critical of a mother's natural pride.<br>

SDAnetters,<br>
<p>
Samuele Bacchiocchi has written a book which may help clear up the issue of<br>
which day of the week Christ was crucified and which day he arose from the <br>
tomb.  I quote from the back cover of the book:<br>
<p>
<i>     &gt; In "The Time of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection" Dr. Samuele </i><br>
<i>     &gt; Bacchiocchi examines at great length each of three crucial texts </i><br>
<i>     &gt; adduced in support of the Wednesday Crucifixion dating....</i><br>
<i>     &gt;</i><br>
<i>     &gt; The book has been written in a clear, non-technical style with the </i><br>
<i>     &gt; earnest desire to help Christians appreciate more fully not merely</i><br>
<i>     &gt; the time element of Christ's death, but primarily the full scope of </i><br>
<i>     &gt; Christ's redemptive ministry, which includes His earthly atonement,</i><br>
<i>     &gt; heavenly ministry and final restoration at His second Advent.</i><br>
<p>
It is available for $12.95 postpaid from:<br>

  I typed this in thinking you might find it interesting and/or give you<br>
ideas.  Typos are mine.<br>
<p>
  This is directed at the USofA, but it could easily apply to any<br>
country that allows their citizens a voice in government.<br>
<p>
<p>
---------------------------------8&lt;-----------------------------<br>
   Fellow citizens, When this country was founded it was to be 'of, for and by<br>
the people'.  Now it seems to be a government of, for and by special interest<br>
groups.  Why?  Because we the people have become less and less involved in the<br>
day to day workings of our government and put complete trust in politicans to do<br>
what is good for us.  The politicans then listen to those who give them input<br>
and we the people haven't been doing much of that, but the special interest<br>
groups have.<br>
   How can we get back the control of our government from the special interest<br>
groups?  Let your elected servants know what you think on the issues and make<br>
your choices stick with your vote!  Less than half of the eligible people in<br>
America are registered voters and less than half of them don't vote.<br>
   A good way to make your feelings known is the letter.  .....................<br>
...... SOME STUFF DELETED .....................................................<br>
..................................................  Then fill in and send copie<br>
of this letter to your government servants.  At 5 cents a copy at your local<br>
library your total cost would be under $5.  The library or phone book is a good<br>
place to get the addresses you will need for mailing. or call the U.S.  Capital<br>
Switch Board at (202) 224-3121.<br>
   Let the President, congress, your governor and state representatives, your<br>
mayor and city council people know how you feel about the issues.  Check below<br>
whether you are For, Against or Undecided about these issues.  If you don't care<br>
about one then leave it blank.<br>
                                                                     EoZ<br>
MY elected government servant,<br>
<p>
   Below I have indicated some of the subjects that I am concerned about and how<br>
I feel about them.  I expect that you will take into consideration my position<br>

Well, I am reluctant to lean on Pathfinders too hard, having enjoyed it<br>
as a youngster and also having been a leader for several years.  However,<br>
my experience as leader was quite different from what Steve was talking<br>
about.  Our club was so little and the members of the church so poor that<br>
we could not afford the uniforms (why are they SO expensive?).  So, we<br>
could not participate in the fairs, parades, and other competitions<br>
because uniforms were a requirement for participation.  Never the less, we<br>
had a club -- my husband and I bought matching t-shirts for all the kids --<br>
and we were very active in witnessing, visiting the elderly, as well as<br>
crafts and general fun.  The kids loved it, the parents loved it (mostly for<br>
the break from the kids one evening a week and on weekends!), and it was<br>
an all around good experience.  I hope something like that is going on<br>
when our kids (forthcoming) are that age -- and I hope somebody young and<br>
energetic as we were is around to lead out!<br>

I asked the Jews what is meant by High Sabbath.  Here are their answers.<br>
Their answers do not pin down a relationship to the weekly Sabbath.<br>
And yet while "preparation day" for the 7th day Sabbath makes sense,<br>
it really does not fit Passover.  And, while dealing with the dead on<br>
a weekly Sabbath was not allowed, it would have been acceptable in<br>
the weekly Sabbath context.  There was a distinction in what you could<br>
do on a weekly Sabbath vs an annual Sabbath.  That is the case even today,<br>
according to the Mishna.<br>
<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<i>&gt;Evidently in the early hundreds CE the term High Sabbath was used,</i><br>
<i>&gt;at least by some.  Today the meaning seems to be lost to speculation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Does anyone have any historically authentic explanation to offer?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any seriously plausible speculation?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One theory is that it means an annual Sabbath coincident with a weekly</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sabbath.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another is that it is one of the more important annual Sabbaths of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the year.  But then which ones?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thanks,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;David Buxton</i><br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hard to tell without the context, but the Sabbath before Passover is <br>
known as "the Big Sabbath" (Shabbat HaGadol).<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hi Dave -- long time no hear.<br>
<p>
I don't know the early history, so this is more of a modern day<br>
view.  The Sabbath before Yom Kippur is often referred to in this<br>
way.   However, as Yom Kippur is sometimes on a Sabbath day, some<br>
people might consider Yom Kippur occurring on a Sabbath to be a<br>
great Sabbath -- but even then, I think the more common use today is<br>
the Sabbath immediately before Yom Kippur.  [Day of Atonement]<br>
<p>
Rosh HaShanah begins a period of repentance by Jews and judgement<br>
by G-d, -- there's a prayer said on those days, which poetically<br>
pictures G-d seated with the hosts of heaven around, and on Rosh<br>
HaShanah G-d records in his books the fate of everyone for the<br>
coming year, and on Yom Kippur he seals the books.  So the<br>
intervening days - including one Sabbath -- the great Sabbath --<br>
are days to repent, to reflect, to plan the year, to plan to be a<br>
better person and to do acts of goodness and charity -- for this<br>
same prayer says that even G-d's edicts can be made less severe<br>
through our own actions of prayer, repentence and charity.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
At a guess this sounds like Shabbos Hagadol which is the Sabbath<br>
before Pesach.  The question is what language was this in, what was<br>
the context, and how was the reference set up.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
No problem, it sounds even more as the Sabbath before Passover as<br>
the name translates as the"Great Sabbath" or "Big Sabbath"<br>
By definition it is alway a sabbath day that occurs each year.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
It might conceivably be a translation of "shabbat shabbaton" or<br>
Sabbath of Sabbaths, a term used especially for the Day of Atonement.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Here are some miscellaneous observations, none historically verified to<br>
the period in question.<br>
<p>
Yom Kippur is called "shabbat shabbaton" (in Leviticus, I think), which<br>
one might call a sabbath of sabbaths.  Note also that Yom Kippur is the<br>
day when the Jubilee year was proclaimed (and possibly the sabbaticals<br>
also).<br>
<p>
The Shabbat before Pesach has held an important place in the calendar.  It<br>
is known as Shabbat haGadol "the great sabbath" in modern times (at<br>
least since the 18th century, probably much earlier).  Other sabbaths<br>
during the year have names as well, although none seem to correspond as<br>
well to your question, off the top of my head.<br>
<p>
Hope this is not a rehash of what you already know.<br>
<p>
Shabbat Shalom,<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Sorry if I spoke over your head.  I assumed from your interesting<br>
question that you knew more than you actually do about Judaism.  <br>
<p>
Anyway, Pesah (hebrew for "passing over") is indeed Passover and the<br>
sabbath preceeding it is known as Shabbat hagadol (hebrew: "the great (or<br>
big) sabbath).<br>
<p>
I might suggest that you look at some of the great books about the Jewish<br>
calendar.  Check out your local library or university library.  A<br>
couple of suggestions off the top of my head are Michael Strassfeld,<br>
"The Jewish Holidays" and Arthur Waskow, "Seasons of our Joy" --<br>
these are both modern, practical guides to the holidays along with<br>
historical information about the holidays and calendar.  There are<br>
also a number of denser books about the traditional calendar, which you<br>
can find in the bibliographies of those two.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
If you like I could inquire as to what the Jews have to say about<br>
annointing the dead on a weekly Sabbath vs an annual Sabbath?<br>

Yesterday's June 3 NPR Morning Edition included a piece from the BBC.<br>
In it, a chap was interviewing the editor of Belgrade, Yugoslavia's<br>
only independent newspaper regarding Slobodan Milosevic, the president<br>
of what's left of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro?).  The editor<br>
characterized Milosevic as a political opportunist and not an idealogue.<br>
If my memory serves me, the editor added something like "He's not a<br>
Marxist, he's not a Communist, he's not any of those.  If it served him,<br>
he might be a Freemason, a [.. I can't remember exactly, but it was<br>
respectable ..], or even a Seventh-day Adventist."<br>
<p>
Did anyone else catch this?  It piqued my curiosity as to what that editor<br>
in Belgrade knows or thinks he knows about SDA's.  8-)<br>
<p>
Reminded me of the time a few years back when I was traveling and<br>
flipped on PBS on the motel room's TV.  It became shortly evident that<br>
the program was surveying feminist movements in various lands.<br>
A particular interview occured in Cuba.  The interviewer asked the<br>
Cuban woman how feminism appealed to women in Cuban society.  The only<br>
detail to the response that I remember is that the feminist could not<br>
persuade Seventh-day Adventist women to join.  ... I was proud of 'em!<br>

Guess I'm surprised we didn't see an avalanche of posts in response<br>
to the request for help regarding a friend having a problem with<br>
anger.  What is Christianity all about if we cannot answer questions<br>
like that?<br>
<p>
I've been telling myself that I've been posting a bit<br>
too often, talking too much and need to sit back on the listening<br>
end a bit more.  But I guess I'll plunge in here.<br>
<p>
A tape of a sermon by an ex-druggie evangelist comes to mind.  He was<br>
telling his story about his former life styles.<br>
<p>
He compared two schools that he attended:  One was a no rules coed<br>
type of school where it was ok to have room mates of the other sex.<br>
The idea was to have the maximum fun with the minimum of rules.<br>
He describes how close to suicide he came.  The other school he<br>
compared it with was a military academy with a very tough regimen.<br>
This he described as where he enjoyed the happiest of his school days.<br>
<p>
Why is it that the no rules sort of a system seems to have so much<br>
appeal to people as being the answer to love and happiness.  And<br>
yet, even by the metrics of the world its missery and it offers one<br>
of the most direct paths to suicide.<br>
<p>
There is the story of a high school class that bannered their class<br>
moto of something to the effect of lets all go off and seek happiness<br>
and let the world be d_____.  Lets go and be selfishly happy, is<br>
what they were saying.  That sounded intruiging and so somebody<br>
tracked the class for the next several years.  They experienced an<br>
unusually high incidence of divorce, failure, even suicide.<br>
<p>
What happens when somebody comes face to face with suicide?  They can<br>
do do it.  That of course would be too bad.  But lets say that the<br>
response is -- OK, I'm about the most miserable person in the world.<br>
Lets pretend I just jumped off the bridge.  I'm dead now.  My own<br>
happiness no longer means anything to me.  From here on I'm going<br>
to set my life asside.   So now instead of pursuing<br>
my own happiness I'm going to go help others.  I'm going to try<br>
and bring happiness to a lot of other people.  You all know whats<br>
going to happen -- The discovery that helping others brings happiness<br>
to ourselves.  Anyone whose total focus is on himself is doomed to<br>
misery, and anger.  Anyone who aggressively pursues the helping of<br>
others is going to benefit the most himself.<br>
<p>
What about anger?  If we are helping someone who has no feet, how<br>
can we be angry with someone who has stolen our shoes?  If we are<br>
helping someone who is homeless and lives under a highway overpass,<br>
then how can we be angry if our insured house burns down?  If we are<br>
helping someone miserable with AIDs, how can we be angry about<br>
a bit of hay fever?<br>
<p>
But even a Budhist can learn that.  To turn to Jesus we don't have<br>
to pretend that we have jumped off a bridge.  Yet, to dedicate our<br>
lives in service to Him we do have to die to self.  Is that death<br>
to self the end of happiness?  No!  Not by a long shot.  Amazingly<br>
enough it is the beginning of the only true form of happiness that<br>
humans can come to know.  In the service of our King there is much<br>
more to do than helping bums under a bridge.  We can also bring people<br>
to eternal salvation.  In that context, what room is there for<br>
anger?  Only to the degree that we turn inward on ourselves, so miserable<br>
that we are not happy enough; to the degree that we are selfish, to<br>
that degree will we be angry and miserable.  Instead we must turn<br>
in service to our creator who has taught us the rewards of being<br>
a servant rather than a master.<br>
<p>
If we die to self, we die to the pursuit of personal happines and<br>
set out in pursuit of the salvation and well being our our neighbor.<br>
Jesus is our example of how to go about doing that.<br>
<p>

I've given some thought about the problem with internal anger and the<br>
fear that it would erupt into rage.  Physical exercise, as suggested,<br>
would help a bit but there are others things one can also do.  For example,<br>
I was told once by a professional that rolling rocks (not boulders!) down<br>
a hill can release angry emotions.  Also throwing rocks at a tree or other<br>
appropriate target out in the woods can help.  Personally, I found one of<br>
the best ways to defuse anger was to fly a kite (honest!).  Many times I<br>
saw my life much like the kite.  When there was an average amount of wind<br>
(adversity), the kite seemed to fly the best.  The sudden absence of wind<br>
was catastrophic (the kite crashed) and huge gusts of wind would send the<br>
kite into fits.  As I fly my kite, identifying my own anger about my<br>
personal winds, I would relax and dissipate much of my angry energy.  I've<br>
tried "helping others" in the past but this usually left me feeling quite<br>
irritable and agitated unless it involved physical activity such as<br>
gardening, painting, etc.  Another activity I found helpful was to wash<br>
and hand wax my car (or somebodyelse's).  All of the approaches, however,<br>
do not address the underlying cause.  Clearly, feelings of rage and being<br>
out of control are signals that something needs to be done about your life.<br>
For example, I used to try to attend and participate in almost every<br>
church/ward function possible.  Soon I found that I had no time to just<br>
sit and relax, clean my house, or exercise.  My pent-up agitation about<br>
consumed me until I realized that if I cut back to only minimal activities<br>
and allowed myself to stay home and do things I needed to--then I felt<br>
less angry.<br>
<p>
Obviously, anyone who feels to the point of rage needs to try to identify<br>
the "why" and "what" of the underlying problem.  A professional counselor<br>
can really help here.  Although it may cost some money, it's worth it in<br>
the long run because internal anger will eventually destroy your physical,<br>
spiritual, and/or mental health.<br>

I think that we have to realize that anger is a natural emotion and even God<br>
gets angry sometimes.  The Bible tells us, "Be ye angry, and sin not, let not<br>
the sun go down upon your wrath."<br>
<p>
I personally know what it is like to repress emotions, it's a behavior that <br>
at one time I indulged quite frequently.  I would make up imaginary<br>
arguments in my head with other people that I wouldn't otherwise dare to<br>
confront.<br>
Now I've moved to the point where I like to talk things out more.<br>
<p>
Anger can be a sign of two things(at least):<br>
<p>
1)  A source of love being threatened.<br>
<p>
2)  A response to control that someone else exercises over you.<br>
<p>
A close friend of mine went for counseling to a psychiatrist, and she <br>
was told, "Write down everything that makes you angry."<br>
<p>
Bit by bit, as she wrote down the various things that made her angry<br>
she realized how others had been manipulating her, and then she was able <br>
to relate in a way so that she would not be vulnerable to this, thus<br>
reducing the amount of anger.<br>

I will be traveling to Geneva, Switzerland for two weeks beginning June <br>
8, ending June 22.  This is a sort of working vacation in which I will <br>
have the responsibility to make some equipment work that we are loaning<br>
to another group.<br>
<p>
During this time I expect to have access to the network, but not much <br>
time to do anything with SDAnet.  So service may be spotty and traffic <br>
may be reduced.  There is no need to hold up postings, however, I <br>
will just process them as I get the chance.<br>

To Whom It May Concern:<br>
 <br>
I am currently a graduate student at the University of Michigan pursuing<br>
a masters degree in information and library studies. I have about one more<br>
year to go before completingmy degree requirements, so I thought this would<br>
be a good time to start exploring employment opportunities around the<br>
country or abroad. The Lord has given me the opportunity to return to school,<br>
in spite of the obstacles, and when I finish my studies I wish to work in His<br>
service by working for the Church as a librarian. While I have a preference<br>
for working at Andrews University or another midwestern SDA university, I will<br>
keep my mind open to go where the Lord knows my skills will be most needed.<br>
But I need to know where the openings are so that I can do my part in looking<br>
for work. I know with prayer and trust, the Lord will guide me to the right<br>
place. If anyone has information regarding this please send me a message as<br>
soon as you can.<br>
 <br>
Thank you very much,<br>
 <br>

The following post showed up on soc.religion.christian.  I found it<br>
to be a good treatment of Calvinism.  At the end the author seems<br>
to be closer to once-saved-always-saved than I am comfortable with.<br>
I wrote to him asking for clarification as it has been my finding<br>
that once-saved-always-saved seems to go hand in glove with Calvinism.<br>
Here is his post to s.r.c.<br>

<p>
  There is a system of teaching abroad today which is infecting our<br>
Fundamental churches, Bible Institutes, Christian Colleges, and<br>
Seminaries.  It is known as Five-Point Calvinism and originated with<br>
John Calvin's interpretation of the Word of God.  The fearsome thing<br>
about it is it's spread into fundamental churches and schools with<br>
little opposition.  As this system of false doctrines spreads into the<br>
last strongholds of Biblical Christianity there is a silence when<br>
there should be a resounding reply from the Word of God by Pastors and<br>
Teachers.  The intellectualism of this system of teaching seems to<br>
have cast a spell over our leaders and the will to resist is stifled<br>
for fear of saying something non-intellectual.  In that which follows<br>
I urge you to compare the Five-Points of Calvinism with the Word of<br>
God and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you into all truth.<br>
  Concerning the Five-Points of Calvinism, it has stated 'Prove any<br>
one of them true and all the others will follow as logical and<br>
necessary parts of the system.  Prove any one of them false and the<br>
whole system must be abandoned.'  I would encourage you to follow this<br>
advice and abandon the system when you find one of the Five-Points of<br>
Calvinism to be wrong.  The Five-Points of Calvinism are as follows:<br>
<p>
        1.  TOTAL INABILITY<br>
        2.  UNCONDITIONAL ELECTION<br>
        3.  LIMITED ATONEMENT<br>
        4.  IRRESISTABLE GRACE<br>
        5.  PERSEVERANCE OF THE SAINTS<br>
<p>
  It is not the purpose of this post to present an exhaustive study of<br>
these points and to examine the Scriptures used by Calvinists to prove<br>
their system of teaching.  Rather, this study is set forth for the<br>
Christian believer who wants to know, very simply stated, what these<br>
Five Points are and whether they are in agreement with all the<br>
Scriptures.<br>
<p>
                            TOTAL INABILITY<br>
<p>
  The teaching of Five-Point Calvinism is that man is totally unable<br>
to do anything to obtain salvation.  They state very emphatically that<br>
he cannot repent or believe the Gospel.  Their teaching is that man<br>
cannot believe until he is born-again.  This new birth is brought<br>
about by God who chooses certain individuals and regenerates them.<br>
Those whom He regenerates are then capable of believing by virtue of<br>
their new birth.  Man does not have a free will by which he is able to<br>
come to Christ for salvation.<br>
  Concerning the statement that man cannot repent we find the word of<br>
God stating the exact opposite.  In Acts 17:30 we find that God<br>
commands "all men everywhere to repent", and that having so<br>
commanded, He expects they can and will.  In II Peter 3:9 we find that<br>
God is "not willing that any should perish, but that all should come<br>
to repentance."  If they should come, then they can come.  God does<br>
not mock men by asking them to do what they cannot do.  In Acts 11:18<br>
we are told that God hath "also to the Gentiles granted repentance<br>
unto life."  Notice that the repentance comes first and it results in<br>
life.<br>
  Concerning the statement that man cannot believe the Gospel, and<br>
that man cannot believe until he is born-again, let the following<br>
scripture be studied - John 1:12, 3:15, 16, 36, 5:24, 6:40, 7:39,<br>
12:36, and 20:31.  These Scripture all show that spiritual life<br>
follows upon the sinner's believing in Jesus Christ.  The Apostle John<br>
gave as his reason for writing his gospel, "that ye might believe that<br>
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have<br>
life through his name."  (John 20:31)  It is very clear that believing<br>
comes first and the new birth immediately follows.  The verses I have<br>
cited from the Gospel of John by no means exhausts the Scripture which<br>
prove life through believing.  If you will take Strong's Concordance<br>
and study the words "believe, believed, believest, believeth,<br>
believing," you will find much more.  A notable example is Acts 16:31<br>
where Paul said, "believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be<br>
saved".  The Calvinist would twist it to read, 'when thou are saved by<br>
the Lord Jesus Christ thou shalt believe'.  What utter disregard for<br>
the plain teaching of the Word of God.<br>
  Concerning the statement that man does not have a free will by which<br>
he is able to come to Christ, please note what Jesus said in John 7:17<br>
"if any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine".  Here He<br>
said that a man may will to do God's will.  Again in John 5:40 Jesus<br>
rebuked the Jews when He said "ye will not come to me, that ye might<br>
have life."  It was not that they could not come, but that they would<br>
not come.  In Revelation 22:17 the Word of God declares "whosoever<br>
will, let him take the water of life freely".  Here God makes a real<br>
offer of the water of life to "whosoever will".<br>
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
  Beloved, God had been pleased "by the foolishness of preaching to<br>
save them that believe."  (I Corinthians 1:21)  Salvation is by<br>
believing, and if we tell the lost man that he cannot believe, and if<br>
we shut the gates of Heaven against him and find ourselves in the<br>
hideous company of him who "hath blinded the minds of them which<br>
believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is<br>
the image of God, should shine unto them."  (II Corinthians 4:4)<br>
<p>
                        UNCONDITIONAL ELECTION<br>
<p>
  The teaching of Five-Point Calvinism is that God has determined and<br>
decreed that some are to be saved without any conditions to be met on<br>
their part.  This is called Unconditional Election and is the choosing<br>
of some to salvation in Christ, while at the same time leaving the<br>
rest in their lost condition by not choosing them.  This election is<br>
not based on God's foreknowing that certain would believe, but is<br>
based on His sovereign will to elect certain ones.  Those who are not<br>
chosen to be part of the Elect of God can in no way enter into that<br>
company.  In line with teaching the statement is made that God does<br>
not love all men, but only those whom he has chosen to be saved.<br>
  The Scripture are also very plain that God has His Elect ones who by<br>
faith in Jesus Christ are predestinated "to be conformed to the image<br>
of his Son," (Romans 8:29).  They are adopted by God and Chosen in<br>
Christ "before the foundation of the world," (Ephesians 1:4, 5).  This<br>
election is plainly declared to be based on the foreknowledge of God<br>
(I Peter 1:2 and Romans 8:29).  Since God knows the end from the<br>
beginning He foreknows those who will believe in Christ.  He has<br>
purposed that they will be to the praise of His glory throughout the<br>
ages and through them He will show "the exceeding riches of his grace"<br>
(Ephesians 2:7).<br>
  The Scriptures are also very plain in stating that "whosoever will"<br>
may come to Christ.  Please read the following Scriptures -<br>
John 3:15, 16, 4:14, 12:46, Acts 2:21, 10:43, Romans 10:13,<br>
Revelation 22:17.  The word "whosoever" means all, any, every, the<br>
whole.  Since we believe in the verbal, plenary inspiration of the<br>
Word of God we are forced to believe that when God moves the Scripture<br>
writers to say "whosoever", then that is exactly what He means.  That<br>
there is a condition to be be met in order for one to be saved is<br>
proved by our Lord's words in John 8:24 "for if we believe not that I<br>
am he, ye shall die in your sins".  Other Scriptures have already been<br>
quoted under Total Inability to bear out the conditional requirement<br>
of believing in order to have salvation.<br>
  That God loves all men in this world and sent His Son to die for<br>
them is abundantly clear from John 3:16.  The Five-Point Calvinist<br>
changes the meaning of the word "world" here and adds to the Word of<br>
God by placing immediately behind it two words, 'the elect'.  The<br>
verse then appears this way, 'For God so loved the world (the elect)<br>
that He gave His only begotten Son, etc.'  The word "world" is used 77<br>
times in the Gospel of John, I would encourage you to take a Strong's<br>
Concordance and look up each occurence, then insert the words 'the<br>
elect' behind each usage of it.  You do not have to go far before you<br>
see how ridiculous it is.<br>
  You see, beloved, if God does not love all men then we should not<br>
love them either.  Since our Christian character comes from the<br>
indwelling of our Lord, we cannot show forth an attribute that is<br>
superior to His.  Yet strangely enough, the Word of God says we are to<br>
love our enemies, our wives, our husbands, our children.  If we must<br>
love lost sinners, and our Lord is holier than we are, we must believe<br>
that He loves them too.  I'll believe John 3:16 as it stands unaltered<br>
by the followers of John Calvin.<br>
<p>
                           LIMITED ATONEMENT<br>
<p>
  The Five-Point Calvinist states that Christ died on the Cross for<br>
the sins of the Elect.  To say that He died for the sins of the Non-<br>
Elect is not reasonable.  Since, according to their system, God has<br>
chosen some to be saved and chosen the rest to be lost, He cannot<br>
require the death of Christ for those He does not plan to save anyhow.<br>
Therefore the Atonement of Christ is limited to the Elect only.<br>
  If you have accepted Total Inability and Unconditional Election it<br>
is necessary to limit the scope of Christ's death on Calvary.  The<br>
only problem is that the Scriptures directly state that the death of<br>
Christ was for every man and is effective for the sinner the moment he<br>
repents and believes.  In I John 2:2 it is said that His death was a<br>
propitiation (satisfaction) not only for our sins but for the sins of<br>
"the whole world".  In Hebrews 2:9 it says that Christ tasted death<br>
for "every man".  I Timothy 2:6 says that He gave himself a ransom for<br>
"all".  John the Baptist declared in John 1:29 that Jesus was the Lamb<br>
of God that taketh away the sins of the "world."  In Isaiah 53:6 the<br>
Word of God states that "all" have gone astray (all men in the world)<br>
and that the Lord laid on Jesus the iniquity of us "all".  Since the<br>
gospel is for "whosoever will" and it consists of the good news that<br>
Christ died for sinners.  I must believe that the Atonement of Christ<br>
is not limited.<br>
  Not only is the Atonement of Christ unlimited and offered to all<br>
men, but the Holy Spirit is presently working to convict the world<br>
(all men) of one sin.  That sin is that Christ paid the penalty for<br>
their sins, but they do not believe on Him (John 16:8, 9).  God is not<br>
willing that any should perish (II Peter 3:9) and it is said that He<br>
will have all men to be saved (I Timothy 2:4).  In scripture we find<br>
the Father giving the Son to the world, the Son tasting death for<br>
every man, and the Holy Spirit convicting the world.  Since God's work<br>
must be our work, we should part company with Five-Point Calvinism<br>
right here.  The Bible knows nothing of a limited Atonement:  that<br>
comes from the vain intellectual reasoning of men.<br>
<p>
                          IRRESISTABLE GRACE<br>
<p>
  Calvinists teach that all those whom God has chosen to be saved will<br>
be unable to resist the call of God.  Since He has predetermined them<br>
to be saved, He effectually calls and regenerates them without any<br>
condition to be met on their part.<br>
  The Word of God teaches that the Grace of God that bringeth<br>
salvation has appeared to all men.  (Titus 2:11)  Since God has<br>
provided salvation for all men, and yet all do not come; that is proof<br>
enough that men do resist the Grace of God.  The Bible gives clear<br>
instances of men resisting the Grace of God.  Jesus stood over<br>
Jerusalem and said that He wanted to gather them unto Himself, but<br>
they would not.  (Matthew 23:37)  When Stephen preached to the Jews he<br>
said that regarding their attitude toward God's Word they were<br>
stiffnecked and that they were resisting the Holy Spirit Who was<br>
calling them (Acts 7:51).  The writer of Hebrews, when describing<br>
those "who draw back unto perdition" (Hebrews 10:39), said that though<br>
they were sanctified by the blood of Christ, yet they had "done<br>
despite unto the Spirit of grace"  (Hebrews 10:28, 29).  Here it is<br>
plain that the blood of Christ was available to them for salvation,<br>
but was refused.  That the Spirit of God strives with sinners to bring<br>
them to repentance and faith is stated in Genesis 6:3.  This verse<br>
also states that God will one day give man up when His grace is<br>
continually resisted.<br>
<p>
                      PERSEVERANCE OF THE SAINTS<br>
<p>
  The last point in the Calvinistic system of teaching is that those<br>
whom God has chosen to be saved will persevere to the end and will not<br>
finally and fully depart from the faith.  The one who is truly born-<br>
again is eternally secure in Christ and is never in danger of losing<br>
his salvation.<br>
  Most Fundamentalists would find little to disagree with in this<br>
statement, except to qualify the way God chooses men to be saved by<br>
stating that His Election is according to His foreknowledge.  The<br>
eternal security of the believer is a fundamental doctrine of<br>
Scripture.  However the false teaching set forth under the first four<br>
points of Calvinism bear their inevitable fruit here.  There is a<br>
subtle exclusion here which is not seen in the stated position, but<br>
which eventually shows up in practice.  In churches where these<br>
doctrines are taught there are the following effects on those who come<br>
into the assembly:<br>
<p>
     1.  The man who is under the conviction of the Spirit and on the<br>
threshold of believing in Christ is soon hearing that he cannot of<br>
himself believe and unless God has chosen him to salvation there is<br>
nothing he can do to accept God's free gift.<br>
<p>
     2.  The one who has been born-again, but is still a babe in<br>
Christ, is often expected to exhibit a spiritual life more advanced<br>
than his growth to date.  Because the fruit is slow in coming he<br>
begins to doubt whether he is truly born-again.  Thus, one who is a<br>
child of God begins to doubt that he is a true believer and sits at<br>
home in absolute frustration, convinced that God has not chosen him.<br>
<p>
     3.  Those who are saved and living a spiritual life begin to<br>
develop an intellectual superiority over those who cannot see the<br>
glorious truths revealed by John Calvin.  Since they are the Elect of<br>
God and the unsaved are the Non-Elect whom God does not love, they<br>
begin to display a self-righteous attitude toward those lost in sin.<br>
The attitude of the Jews toward the Gentiles, whom they referred to as<br>
"dogs", begins to come into the life of the Calvinist.  It is the<br>
attitude displayed by John Calvin when he desired the death penalty to<br>
be pronounced upon the Michael Servetus.  John Calvin handled the<br>
theological part of the trial of Servetus, who was subsequently burned<br>
at the stake for blasphemy.<br>
  The usage of the phrase 'Perseverance of the Saints' gives the<br>
impression that the saints are doing something to keep themselves<br>
secure in their salvation.  A more Scriptural phrase would seem to be<br>
'The Preservation of the Saints.'  (I Thessalonians 5:23; Jude 1)<br>
Beloved, inquire of your Bible teacher regarding Calvinism.  Do not be<br>
satisfied with a 'purposely evasive' answer.  The man who holds these<br>
teachings usually will not be a soul-winner or be mission minded.  If<br>
your church has no outreach for the lost it may well be that Five-<br>
Point Calvinism has already done it's deadly work.<br>

Friends, co-listers, brothers, sisters, jews and gentiles :-)<br>
 <br>
This is the last message I am sending to both lists from<br>
UIC.<br>
 <br>
I have recently graduated with a B.A. in Political Science and<br>
Sociology.  In about two weeks, my account will be cancelled.<br>
 <br>
I have enjoyed being a member of both lists for the past 18<br>
months.  I only wish the traffic in SDa-L will one day increase.<br>
 <br>
Since I have enjoyed the lists so much, I decided to apply<br>
for graduate school so that my computer access would not end :-)<br>
 <br>
So I did.  Next fall, I will start graduate studies at the<br>
University of Chicago (in political science).  At that time,<br>
as soon as I get a computer accout, I will subscribe again<br>
to both lists.<br>
 <br>
In the meantime, I wish everyone a happy summer and as someone<br>
says,<br>
 <br>
hasta la vista, baby!!!   (instead of baby, read, friends, please).<br>
 <br>

Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit the French-speaking main<br>
Adventist church here in Geneva.  It was interesting in many respects,<br>
not the least of which is because I hardly understand a word of French. <br>
Nevertheless, <br>
I could tell just from the form that was followed that they were having the <br>
mission story in Sabbath school, or the announcements, or the nominating <br>
committee report, or scripture reading as the case may be.<br>
<p>
I saw at the SDA church what I had also seen posted in various places<br>
on the street, a poster advertising a full-scale model of the Bible<br>
sanctuary, which is displayed in Lausanne.  Evidently they are planning<br>
to have it up all summer as a outreach tool.<br>
<p>
Our church is marked on all the maps of the city, and listed in the various<br>
public church listings, so it's well known and easy to find.<br>
<p>
Geneva is essentially a Protestant city, thanks to John Calvin and friends,<br>
so most of the big old churches are Protestant churches, including the giant<br>
Temple de St. Pierre.  Here it is possible to see the very pulpit from<br>
which Calvin and Farel preached in the early days of the Reformation. <br>
Also there is a pipe organ to die for.<br>
<p>
I'm having more fun than I can stand, and getting a bit of work done, too.<br>

Although I am no longer a member of the SDA Church I still receive <br>
the Pacific Union Recorder and the Adventist Review.  I read this <br>
mostly out of curiosity now and occasionally find something that <br>
really bothers me.  This week's Recorder has an article entitled <br>
"AHS/West seeks new ways to focus hospitals on mission."  The first <br>
four sentences posed four questions and then stated that<br>
<p>
"these are only a few of many ethics problems pondered at a mission <br>
conference sponsored by Adventist Health System/West".  <br>
<p>
The questions were:<br>
<p>
"How much involvement should a Seventh-day Adventist hospital <br>
have in community affairs such as holiday events, blood drives, <br>
health fairs, service clubs, parades, and disaster relief programs?"<br>
<p>
"Should Adventist hospitals accept funds raised by spontaneous <br>
nonAdventist community-sponsored projects when those funds come <br>
from walk-a-thons, auctions which include locally produced art, <br>
jewelry, wine and a weekend trip to Las Vegas or from a gala ball <br>
held on Friday night or Sabbath?"<br>
<p>
"In the current economic survival climate, when is it acceptable for <br>
an Adventist hospital to joint venture with another hospital serving <br>
the same geographical area?"<br>
<p>
"How many nonAdventist employees are acceptable in an Adventist <br>
hospital?"<br>
<p>
My personal opinion is that *IF* these are really the "tough ethical <br>
questions" facing Adventist hospital in the US, then somebody is <br>
really hiding their head in the sand!  NonAdventist hospitals struggle <br>
with REAL ethical questions such as:<br>
<p>
How many nonpaying welfare patients can we afford to care for and <br>
when should they be shipped to county facilities?<br>
<p>
Can we afford to do honest diagnosis coding when the level of <br>
reimbursement for Medicare patients is based solely on the codes <br>
rather than the actual care given?<br>
<p>
What do we do about uninsured but not poverty stricken (at least <br>
not yet) patients and their families?<br>
<p>
<p>
What really appalls me about this article on the SDA ethical <br>
"dilemmas" is the second question about accepting funds if raised by <br>
methods not "approved" by the church (BTW, I never knew walk-a-<br>
thons and the sale of art was evil!).  Now come on people!  Have we <br>
lost all the thinking leaders in the SDA church?  Is this really a <br>
problem?  <br>
<p>
If you look in the Bible, you find many, many instances where God's <br>
people were given gifts from pagan cultures and there was no <br>
question that this was to be accepted and put to use in the Lord's <br>
work.<br>
<p>
Take the Exodus of Israel from Egypt.  The Israelites were told to ask <br>
for gold, silver, and clothing from their Egyptian neighbors and in <br>
Exodus 12:36 it says in the NIV that they "plundered the Egyptians".  <br>
We know later that this silver, gold, and precious clothe was used to <br>
build and furnish the wilderness Sanctuary and to make priestly <br>
garments.  Did it matter that much of the jewelry so obtained was <br>
probably used in pagan Egyptian worship?  NO!  It was sacred to the <br>
Lord and his work.<br>
<p>
How about the fall of Jericho.  In Joshua 6:19, the Israelites are told <br>
that all the gold, silver and articles of bronze and iron were sacred to <br>
the Lord and must go into His treasury.  This was plunder and booty <br>
from a pagan city.  They were not told to leave any golden idols <br>
behind but give all to the Lord's treasury.<br>
<p>
What about the Queen of Sheba's visit to King Solomon found in I <br>
Kings 10?  The Queen of Sheba (from a pagan country) gave Solomon <br>
120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices and precious stones.  <br>
Did Solomon first ask her about where all these riches came from?  <br>
No!  In fact, the following verse says that Hiram's ships brought gold <br>
from Ophir and great cargoes of Almugwood and precious stones.  <br>
The wood was used to make the supports for the Temple and the <br>
Royal Palace.  They also made harps and lyres for the musicians.<br>
<p>
What about the gifts brought by the three wise men to Baby Jesus?<br>
<p>
Lastly, what about Paul's discussion about whether meat that had <br>
been offered to idols should be eaten?  He clearly indicates that the <br>
history of an object (where it came from, where it's been, how it has <br>
been used before) is irrelevant to Christians.<br>
<p>
Gifts given to God's church are to be accepted and used for His work.  <br>
It should not matter in how the money was raised.  I would like to <br>
ask these SDA hospital "ethicists" the following questions:<br>
<p>
Would they accept a large donation from an SDA member if they <br>
knew the money was won in a state lottery?<br>
<p>
How about money from law suit settlement?  (I had a great aunt who <br>
was in a car accident years ago.  She promised the Lord that half of <br>
whatever she got from the insurance company to settle the damages <br>
would be donated to help build her local SDA church.  As you can <br>
guess, they graciously accepted her gift of $25,000 and I suppose she <br>
felt that the settlement was larger because half had been "dedicated" <br>
to the Lord).<br>
<p>
Recently, Pacific Union College Alumni Association was raising money <br>
by offering Master Card and Visa credit cards to church members.  <br>
We were told that a certain percentage of the interest on these card <br>
would be given to PUC.  Knowing what SDAs know about God's plan <br>
to NOT live on credit, is this within the guidelines of "ethical" <br>
fundraising?<br>

How many times have we heard the phrase "God loves the sinner, but he<br>
hates the sin." ?  While I don't dispute that God hates sin, I wonder<br>
the message<br>
we are sending when we say "God loves you, but..."  It is my experience<br>
that when the statement "I love you" is followed by "but", then what<br>
comes afterward doesn't matter, the message has been made clear that<br>
whatever love<br>
is offered is conditional.<br>
<p>
What would be a better way to express the unconditional love of God?<br>

Dear SDA-L<br>
 <br>
Well, after some heroics by the LLUVM system people and lots of hassles<br>
for Enoch, I am now a full owner of SDA-L and ready to help with various<br>
requests that have been piling up during our technical difficulties.<br>
 <br>
Some changes that have already been made:<br>
Everyone's distribution policy has been set to RENEW so that if you<br>
move away on us or something the LISTSERV will ask you to confirm your<br>
subscription automatically.<br>
 <br>
Also, we have SET NOMAIL those people whose addresses have been bouncing<br>
back with undeliverable mail.  So now it is possible to make traffic on<br>
SDA-L without drowning its owners in error messages.<br>
 <br>
Again, please address any problems with unanswered list requests to me<br>
at st0o@andrew.cmu.edu or st0o@ANDREW.Bitnet<br>
 <br>

<p>
Well Steve, the best way I could come up with was, "For God so loved<br>
the world that He gave His Only Begotten Son."<br>
<p>
But I wonder if we sometimes focus *only* on the unconditional Love of<br>
God without loving the person enough to also tell them about the<br>
immutable justice of God.  We know that "God is Love," and we also know<br>
that "justice is the foundation of His throne."  It would seem to me<br>
that telling a person about the Love of God without explaining that He<br>
is also exercising mercy towards us, because of our sin, would be only<br>
half the story -- sort of like eating the cake but not getting any<br>
icing...<br>
<p>
We would do well to remember that it cannot be the Love of God *alone*<br>
that saves us from the lake of fire, for those who will be standing in<br>
that fire will also be recipients of the unconditional love of God.<br>
<p>
It is not only the Love of God, but also His Grace that we need.  If you<br>
do a study on Grace, you will find that it is much more than forgiveness;<br>
it is also Power -- the great Power of God to "will and to do of His Good<br>
Pleasure."  We must not sit back and drink in the Love of God without also<br>
seeking His Grace.<br>
<p>
I tell people of the Great Unconditional Love of God, but I also try to<br>
explain that His Grace and Forgiveness are Conditional -- that we must be<br>
baptised into death with Him for those things to be ours -- we must die<br>
to sin AND self for Christ cannot share the throne of our hearts with any<br>
other god -- we cannot serve two masters.<br>
<p>
"For God so Loved the world that He gave His Only Begotten Son, that<br>
whosoever BELIEVETH on His, should not perish but have everlasting life."<br>

<i>&gt; "these are only a few of many ethics problems pondered at a mission </i><br>
<i>&gt; conference sponsored by Adventist Health System/West".  </i><br>
<p>
Since we do not have the whole list we do not know what the others are.<br>
Hence, it is difficult to come up with a list of the issues which we judge<br>
are the heavy-duty ones in order to compare/contrast them with the ones which<br>
they feel are the heavy duty ones.  I have no idea why the writer selected<br>
these, but I unwilling to assert that these *must* be THE heavy-duty issues.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "How much involvement should a Seventh-day Adventist hospital </i><br>
<i>&gt; have in community affairs such as holiday events, blood drives, </i><br>
<i>&gt; health fairs, service clubs, parades, and disaster relief programs?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Should Adventist hospitals accept funds raised by spontaneous </i><br>
<i>&gt; nonAdventist community-sponsored projects when those funds come </i><br>
<i>&gt; from walk-a-thons, auctions which include locally produced art, </i><br>
<i>&gt; jewelry, wine and a weekend trip to Las Vegas or from a gala ball </i><br>
<i>&gt; held on Friday night or Sabbath?"</i><br>
<p>
Cheryl, I appreciate your Scripturally-based arguments on what money<br>
*is* acceptable.  Do you feel, then, that any and all money is acceptable?<br>
How about money from a drug dealer?  (NPR had a story one time about a<br>
dealer who was loved in his community because of his generosity towards<br>
community projects such as gyms, community centers, etc.)  How about<br>
money from a purveyor of pornography?  How about money for abortions?<br>
Wherever the line is drawn, the policy should be based upon Scriptural<br>
principals, so your contribution is helpful.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "In the current economic survival climate, when is it acceptable for </i><br>
<i>&gt; an Adventist hospital to joint venture with another hospital serving </i><br>
<i>&gt; the same geographical area?"</i><br>
<p>
There are some hints of moral relativism here which I hope they perceive and<br>
turn away from.  I would contend that 2 Corinthians 6:14 applies here.  As<br>
do the other Scriptural injunctions against partnerships (numerous in Proverbs)<br>
and any financial/legal involvement with non-Christians.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "How many nonAdventist employees are acceptable in an Adventist </i><br>
<i>&gt; hospital?"</i><br>
<p>
A fair question since hospitals are to be an arm of SDA ministry and mission.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My personal opinion is that *IF* these are really the "tough ethical </i><br>
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
See my first comments.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; questions" facing Adventist hospital in the US, then somebody is </i><br>
<i>&gt; really hiding their head in the sand!  NonAdventist hospitals struggle </i><br>
<i>&gt; with REAL ethical questions such as:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How many nonpaying welfare patients can we afford to care for and </i><br>
<i>&gt; when should they be shipped to county facilities?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Can we afford to do honest diagnosis coding when the level of </i><br>
<i>&gt; reimbursement for Medicare patients is based solely on the codes </i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than the actual care given?</i><br>
<p>
What evidence is there that SDA hospitals are falsifying diagnostic codes?<br>
If widespread, it would indeed by deceitful and a disgrace.  If rare, it<br>
would no less be deceitful and disgraceful, but *would* indicate that policy<br>
and practice is to be honest.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What do we do about uninsured but not poverty stricken (at least </i><br>
<i>&gt; not yet) patients and their families?</i><br>
<p>
Good questions.  I have been concerned for some time that SDA hospitals have<br>
been trending towards being run more like businesses rather than as<br>
ministries and missions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What really appalls me [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now come on people!  Have we lost all the thinking leaders in the SDA church?</i><br>
<p>
Very strong language!  There is much evidence to suggest otherwise.<br>
I know too many godly, self-sacrificing leaders, teachers, pastors,<br>
missionaries, doctors, et al, to agree.  Do we need to become wiser in<br>
applying God's ways to daily life?  I readily accept that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Knowing what SDAs know about God's plan to NOT live on credit, is this</i><br>
<i>&gt; within the guidelines of "ethical" fundraising?</i><br>
<p>
To be honest, in all my SDA schooling (grade 1 thru B.S.) I never once<br>
heard anyone indicate that Scripture said Christians (let alone SDAs) must<br>
not borrow.  Oh, sure, here and there folk saying credit could be a trap,<br>
you just have to learn to use it wisely (even contemporaries such as Larry<br>
Burkett say credit is OK if managed properly).<br>
<p>
I did not learn what Scripture had to say re Lordship and financial matters<br>
(in the broadest sense) until I attended the Advanced Seminar of the Institute<br>
in Basic Life Principles (Bill Gothard, Jim Sammonds; and developed further<br>
in Men's Manual #2 and the Scriptural Principles for Financial Freedom<br>
videotape seminar by Jim Sammonds of IBLP).  I recommend this material<br>
heartily.  It changed our lives, and those of several friends, dramatically.<br>

I'm back from Switzerland, having got most of the work done and also <br>
having more fun than I could afford or stand.  Please resume normal <br>
posting levels.  <br>
<p>
Since I don't understand French hardly at all, I missed a lot of the<br>
news that went past me.  But I did see a poster in Annecy, France, the<br>
last day I <br>
was there, advertising an ecumenical conference on the Bible, which<br>
seemed to be cooperative between most of the denominations including<br>
Evangelical, Catholic, and Adventist.  This seems an unusual instance of<br>
cooperation.<br>
Any clues what may be going on here?<br>

How does one keep from drifting away from Christ in an environment that makes<br>
this especially easy? How does one make time for Christ when academic, <br>
marital, and financial demands are so overwhelming?<br>

<i>&gt; If we see that a certain gift is missing from our church, what should we</i><br>

<i>&gt; should we ask for more?  Is it appropriate to ask for a specific</i><br>
<i>&gt; spiritual gift?</i><br>
<p>
1 Cor 12:12-31 talks about the church having different gifts making<br>
up the whole body.  Specifically v28 says "In the church God has put<br>
all in place: in the first place apostles, in the second place<br>
prophets, ..." (Good News).  To me this passage says that a church<br>
needs all the gifts and if one is missing it is appropriate to pray<br>
that the gift which is missing be given.  I don't see anything<br>
inappropriate about praying for the church to receive a gift (as<br>
opposed to asking for something personally.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As I read the Bible, it is appropriate:  1 Cor. 14:1  "Follow after</i><br>
<i>&gt; charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."</i><br>
<i>&gt; When was the last time any of us prayed for the gift of prophecy?  Or</i><br>
<i>&gt; the gift of tongues, for that matter?  We know that "...your Heavenly</i><br>
<i>&gt; Father shall give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him."</i><br>
<p>
I've remember being quoted 1 Cor 12:11, about the Holy Spirit giving<br>
gifts as _he_ wishes (emphasis as put by the pastor who told me this).<br>
What he said amounted to that we shouldn't pray for a specific gift<br>
(this was at a time when I was learning about tongues but that's<br>
another story :-).  But as you've noted, 1 Cor 14:1 tells us to<br>
"eagerly desire the greater gifts" (NIV, from memory).  I would see<br>
this almost as a command.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are we asking?  Are we ready to receive?  Or is the Spirit already among</i><br>
<i>&gt; us, working, and most of us don't even know it?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, no, no (at least in some of the churches I've been involved in).<br>
The Holy Spirit is, I feel, largely undiscovered in the SDA church<br>
(well in this city at least).  We talk about the Spirit of Prophecy,<br>
and ask the Holy Spirit to come into our lives, but not a lot of<br>
people really know what they're asking for; they haven't learnt who<br>
the Holy Spirit is, what he wants to do for us, what the baptism of<br>
the Holy Spirit is (as opposed to water baptism - see Acts 1:1-5).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I hope we can build a doctrinal and practical discussion on the Holy</i><br>
<i>&gt; Spirit here on SDAnet, but more importantly I hope we can know the</i><br>
<i>&gt; working of the Spirit in our lives both individually and corporately.</i><br>

Some of you are most likely acquainted with the Spiritual Gifts <br>
Inventory, developed by Cruz and Naden at the SDA Theological Seminary.<br>
In seminars which are given in SDA churches, this survey is given to <br>
people and through it people discover what spiritual gifts they have.<br>
This then serves as a guide to know what church offices or projects one<br>
should volunteer to help with, or people can voluntarily submit this <br>
information to the nominating committee to guide them as they are making <br>
decisions about who will serve as officers.  I have observed that this<br>
survey and the associated seminar was quite helpful to our church in<br>
Pittsburgh<br>
in helping us understand where we could be used.<br>
<p>
But a question I posed at that seminar, which was not answered to my<br>
satisfaction at that time and still troubles me to some extent, is this.<br>
If we see that a certain gift is missing from our church, what should we<br>
do about it?  Must we be content with the gifts we have already, or<br>
should we ask for more?  Is it appropriate to ask for a specific<br>
spiritual gift?<br>
<p>
As I read the Bible, it is appropriate:  1 Cor. 14:1  "Follow after<br>
charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."<br>
When was the last time any of us prayed for the gift of prophecy?  Or<br>

<p>

<p>
I hope we can build a doctrinal and practical discussion on the Holy<br>

Looks like the traffic increases during the school year, drops off in the<br>
summer, and starts climbing again in the fall as new people get accounts and<br>
access.<br>

Today saw President Bush introduce a plan which is a variant of many<br>
others he has put out.  The plan would set aside $500 million to be used<br>
as scholarships for elementary and high school children to attend the<br>
school of their choice, even a religious one.  Although no one in<br>
Washington thinks it will actually pass Congress, the advocacy of such a<br>
measure by the President of the United States is still cause for concern.<br>
<p>
My mind is drawn to the scene in South Africa, where for years our<br>
Adventist secondary schools accepted government funds (These funds have<br>
now been cut off.)  Of course, the government funds came with strings<br>
attached, and the string was that as long as they took these government<br>
funds, they could not admit Black students.  The siren song of<br>
government money (which provided about 10% of the school's operating<br>
costs) served to keep Adventist primary and secondary schools segregated<br>
in S. Africa long after Catholic and Anglican schools had disdained the<br>
government money and integrated.<br>
<p>
For a description of the situation in Australia, I would point to Colin<br>
Standish's book _Defenders Of The Faith_.  Though I don't remember all<br>
the details, he recounts one remark made to him by an education offical<br>
in <br>
the Australian church at the time:  "It was so easy to refuse government<br>
aid when none was offered."<br>
<p>
I realize that since I have no children, school-age or otherwise, this<br>
is a hypothetical situation for me.  I also realize that editorial views<br>
advocating just this type of aid to parents of children in parochial<br>
schools have been voiced by Roy Adams in the Adventist Review recently. <br>
So is this concern about government dollars going into our schools just<br>
an unfounded fear?  Do our schools in their weakened financial condition<br>
have the will power to stand up to the potential of a large chunk of<br>
cash?  Am I outdated in my concern, or is this really a problem?<br>

When I first had the idea of starting SDAnet two years ago, I thought about <br>
making a Usenet newsgroup, but soon realized that we could never win the <br>
vote that would be required to create a new newsgroup.  This intuition<br>
proved right as over the last year we have seen proposals for<br>
soc.religion.mormon and soc.religion.christian.catholic go down to<br>
defeat.  There seems to be a widespread feeling on the net that a<br>
mainstream newsgroup should not be <br>
devoted to just one denomination.<br>
<p>
With an alt type group though, there is no requirement for a vote.  All<br>
that's required is some discussion in alt.config and then having a<br>
system administrator start the new group.  It appears like my system<br>
admins will be willing to do this if it's something I want to do.<br>
<p>
So, does anyone have any feedback on this idea.  It would be possible to <br>
have this group created with moderation.  Just like the idea of putting<br>
SDA-L out for public view, it's not something that has to be done, just<br>
a possibility that might be interesting to try, I am not sure myself if<br>
I should do it yet.  It might be helpful to know how many have access to<br>
Usenet news, I can tell from the addresses that many readers of SDAnet<br>
do not and we would still have to have a mailing list of some sort<br>
regardless.<br>
<p>
 From September of 1992 onwards, I will finally have the opportunity to<br>
monitor the net with all the glory of X Windows which is the mailing<br>
system at Carnegie Mellon.  I will be in Pittsburgh for the fall<br>
semester to take some classes.<br>

<p>
How is this any different than the government allowing you to deduct<br>
charitable contributions (tithe) on your tax return?  In both cases<br>
the government is making a value judgement about what it thinks is<br>
important.  I would guess that most SDAs would consider such a tax<br>
deduction sacrosanct.<br>
<p>
We can argue that such a tax deduction is "right", because it promotes<br>
the social welfare of the society.  But so does school choice.  In<br>
both cases there may be a cost to be paid, though.<br>

<i>&gt; measure by the President of the United States is still cause for concern.</i><br>
<p>
     As an SDA who is also a Libertarian (strange combo eh?  Any other<br>
Libertarian SDA's out there in netland?) I look at it from a different<br>
perspective.  To paraphrase a recent comment on SDAnet, God didn't<br>
give children to the state--he gave them to parents.  I believe that<br>
anything which gives parents greater control over the education of<br>
their children is inherently a good thing.<br>
<p>
The bill in question does not require anything of the private school <br>
except that they are legally a school.  Our schools already had to<br>
meet this standard.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Am I outdated in my concern, or is this really a problem?</i><br>
<p>
     Not at all.  It is a definate source of concern when the state<br>
gets too much control over anything, most especially our institutions<br>
and church.  But this bill I percieve as weakening the power of the state<br>
over parents--many of whom simply can't afford to pay for both public<br>
and private schooling of their children.<br>
<p>
The ideal of course is that parents could send both their children and<br>
their $$$ whereever they wanted in a free market of school systems.<br>
However, since that is politically unfeasable at present, this is<br>
a good first step.<br>

In the mail system of Carnegie Mellon, there is space to receive all<br>
sorts of LISTSERV based lists such as SDA-L.  So I have requested my<br>
local system administrators to receive all posts of SDA-L into a local<br>
newsgroup which will be available for any member of the campus to read.<br>
They have granted that request and the new newsgroup should go in any<br>
day.<br>
 <br>
We'll see how it works.  If there are no problems we may suggest that<br>
others of you who have bit.listserv.* newsgroups do the same.  In the<br>
meantime,<br>
we need to put something worthwhile to read out there.<br>

<i>&gt; Today saw President Bush introduce a plan which is a variant of many</i><br>

As well it should be.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; in the Australian church at the time:  "It was so easy to refuse government</i><br>
<i>&gt; aid when none was offered."</i><br>
<p>
Here, too.  I don't think that enough of us have really understood<br>
it though.<br>

<i>&gt; schools have been voiced by Roy Adams in the Adventist Review recently. </i><br>
<p>
We can see pretty clearly that the public shool system is in shambles<br>
(there are some areas that are doing better than others, but they're<br>
shrinking).  I doubt if it has missed the notice of a lot of us that<br>
we're supporting both the public, and private school systems.  It can<br>
be a real burden, too.  This makes all the more tempting the feeling<br>
that we ought ot be getting some of it back.  We ought to be very careful<br>
how we "get some of it back".  Shoot, I'm paying taxes toward a public<br>
school system that I won't be using, and paying tithe that goes in part<br>
to a church school system that I'm also not using.  (Who said home-schooling<br>
was cheap?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So is this concern about government dollars going into our schools just</i><br>
<i>&gt; an unfounded fear?  Do our schools in their weakened financial condition</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the will power to stand up to the potential of a large chunk of</i><br>
<i>&gt; cash?  Am I outdated in my concern, or is this really a problem?</i><br>
<p>
If it isn't now, I think it will be.  And if we come to depend on outside<br>
money, it'll be all that much harder to do without it when the strings<br>
that come attached to the cash start to get uncomfortable.<br>
<p>
Watch for lots of persuasive voices clamoring to accept this money, because<br>
"it will only hurt the students if we don't take it".  Maybe so, but it's<br>
going to hurt a lot worse in the long run if we *do* take it.<br>
<p>
Anyone nervous about the way the current presidential election is going?  8}<br>

Theoretically, an "alt.sda" would be a great idea.<br>
<p>
Practically, I couldn't subscribe to it because none of the<br>
"alt.*" groups show up on my xvnews list.<br>
<p>
Oh, well. Keep forwarding, Steve!<br>

Integrated total is 4.3 Megabytes so far.  At least half of that <br>
is probably the extra headers put on by Carnegie Mellon's mail system.<br>
Peak number of messages in any one month is 200, also in April 91.<br>
We have done 60-message weeks, but never kept up the intensity that hard for<br>
a whole month.<br>

It seems hard to believe, but we have been on the air for two years now.<br>
 From the small beginning with seven subscribers we have grown to what <br>
we are now.<br>
<p>
I had planned to prepare a feature on the best of SDAnet over the first two<br>
years, but I've been unable to log on to the machine where I keep the<br>
archives for the last couple of days.  Over the past two years we have <br>
generated several megabytes of postings and grown to almost 100 subscribers.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks everyone for your support, whether you have been with us from the <br>
beginning or just joined recently.  Remember, members come to SDAnet most <br>
frequently the same way they come to church, by personal invitation and by <br>
word of mouth.<br>

The idea of a voucher system allowing parents the right to choose where to<br>
send their tax money and their children to is only another step in the <br>
erosion of the public school system in America.<br>
<p>
An idea originated by Thomas Jefferson, the public schools were designed to<br>
prepare children for life in the adult world, at least some level of<br>
competency in that world.<br>
<p>
The public school, by its nature, brings together children from different<br>
cultures and backgrounds in order that, as a byproduct of the three R's, <br>
they learn how to live with and understand people from other cultures.<br>
<p>
It is when people feel that a certain doctrine or principle should be emphasized<br>
in a child's education that we see a Balkanization of educational ideas. Results<br>
include the Catholic and our own SDA school systems.<br>
<p>
I see nothing wrong with their very existence, for they are free to espouse<br>
their doctrine as they see fit, so long as they still produce active members<br>
of this society. It is when government money, in the form of taxes, is used<br>
to, in essence, keep those parochial schools open is when the concept of<br>
the public school is undermined.<br>
<p>
For those who cannot afford a private school education, the voucher system is<br>
a tempting idea. Yet, pulling their money out of their local school will only<br>
erode even more the quality of the public school education. Not only the lack<br>
of funding will hurt the public school, but also the reinforcement of a<br>
lackluster image of public school education will be just as damaging.<br>
<p>
Not only that, you are saying that the government has abdicated its role<br>
as the educator of its citizenry, leaving it up to churches and entrepreneurs.<br>
Giving govt money to them is essentially an endorsement not only of their<br>
techniques, but of their doctrine.<br>
<p>
Because this country is looking again to the MTV quick fix for society's ills,<br>
the voucher plan will get more attention than it deserves. Drop it, George!<br>

<i>&gt; ... Not only that, you are saying that the government has abdicated</i><br>

<p>
After reading SDA and religious liberty writings for many years, I<br>
have come to the opinion that the trend over the years has been toward<br>
the "isolationist" point of view.  That is, give us (churches) our<br>
religious liberty and we will go off into our own little world and we<br>
won't worry about society at large.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, we do live in society.  Any government in any society<br>
has to promulgate some values else there won't be a government or a<br>
society.  Public schools, welfare, taxes, and defense are among the<br>
many areas where value choices have to be made.<br>
<p>
A religious liberty advocate may be right to, say, oppose prayer in<br>
public schools, or use of tax dollars to fund the military, or any<br>
other issue, but simply making choices on these individual issues is<br>
not enough.  One has to go further and outline a foundation upon which<br>
society's shared values should be based.  I have never seen this done<br>
by the folks pushing religious liberty the hardest.<br>

Now that I have your attention:<br>
I noticed a rather unfavorable review of this book in the latest issue<br>
of the newsletter of the Association of Adventist Physicists.  The book<br>
was authored by Ron Wyatt, whom I last encountered at the Friendship<br>
Camporee<br>
in Pennsylvania, teaching this to Pathfinders.  Wyatt is an anesthetist<br>
from Madison, Tennesee.<br>
<p>
Henry Pearl, the reviewer, claims (and rightly so) that Wyatt has<br>
misunderstood the geomagnetic field reversal data to mean actual<br>
flipping over of the earth, confusing celestial poles with magnetic<br>
poles.<br>
(Note that Pearl himself subscribes to the idea of a flood, as well.)<br>
<p>
I find it distressing that there are those who go off half-cocked<br>
claiming this or that piece of evidence proves the flood when in fact<br>
they don't understand such a piece of evidence.  On the other hand, it's<br>
not wise to attribute to deceit what can be explained by stupidity.<br>
<p>
For those who would rather strengthen their faith than know the truth, <br>
this book may be obtained from <br>
<p>
Ron Wyatt<br>
P.O. Box 5931<br>
Madison, TN  37116<br>
<p>
I understand Wyatt has embarked on other such expeditions in the past,<br>
including claiming to know where the Ark of the Covenant is.  If anyone has<br>
further information on his track record, let me know.  SDA physicists<br>
are still doing damage control in the wake of Bob Gentry, and now this<br>
has come up.  What next?  Are there any studies that show SDA's to be<br>
more gullible than the average population?<br>

<i>&gt;   If the position that death = an unconscious state were we don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything, how could Jesus raise himself?  The NT clear says in a couple</i><br>

   " "whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was <br>

A few weeks back, my eldest daughter (who just returned from Weimar Academy<br>
yesterday) was on a back-packing trip in the Sierras.  Sabbath afternoon,<br>
she, 3 or 4 friends, and a teacher decided to hike to the top of a nearby<br>
peak whose snowy top gleamed invitingly in the sunshine against an azure blue<br>
sky.  Near the top they had a choice of crossing a large snow patch or<br>
going around it.  To go around it to the left, up and around and down, would<br>
have involved scrambling over a field of loose granite "chunks".  To the right<br>
the sloping snow patch had a "knee" and dropped off towards who knows what.<br>
No good.  So, they chose to cross the snow.<br>
<p>
It might not have hit me either, since I have no experience in high country,<br>
but, in hindsight, they failed to recognize the effect of warm, sunny days<br>
and cold, even freezing nights on a snow bank.  The upshot was an icy crust<br>
of varying thickness, hiding the danger of a slippery slope.<br>
<p>
For the first x number of feet, their steps crunched through the crust to<br>
sure footing.  But then my Liesl took a step that didn't break through,<br>
slipped, and started to fall and slide downhill at the same time.  The fellow<br>
behind her, a slight fellow no taller than she, grabbed her and hung on.  With<br>
a little help, she was back on her feet.<br>
<p>
Once everyone's heart had calmed down they continued with much greater care.<br>
 From a vantage point, they looked back and could see where she fell, the<br>
distance to the knee in the slope, and what lay below.  Had the fellow not<br>
caught her, she was mere seconds from sliding off a cliff to rocks below.<br>
<p>
Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his<br>
mercy endureth for ever. (Ps106:1)<br>

Hi Steve,<br>
<p>
Thanks for the great job of moderating.<br>
<p>
Since you do moderate, do think you might consider putting sdanet on a<br>
digest format?  It certainly would remove a lot of clutter of<br>
maintaining tons of individual e-mails.<br>
<p>
Just my 2 cents.<br>
<p>
Thanks.<br>
<p>
Danny<br>
[I have considered this, and even offered to do it from time to time, <br>
but the interest hasn't been there.  It would be a lot more work <br>
for me since my system doesn't lend itself easily to concatenating<br>
messages.  The advantages would be that everyone would get only one or<br>
two messages a day instead of the 5-10 we have been averaging lately.<br>
It would also cut down on extra-=short posts and reduce the relative<br>
volume of headers in the messages.  The disadvantages, besides making <br>
more work for me, is that it would be harder to respond to original <br>
senders via E-mail, harder to keep a discussion thread going, and <br>
people would have to read through all the articles to see the ones they<br>
want to read.  Let me know what you think about this.  SCT]<br>

Over this past weekend, the Chicagoland Youth Association (CHIYA),<br>
of which I am secretary, held our annual youth rally at Hinsdale Jr. Academy.<br>
The local Hinsdale leaders (whom I also help) gave the Friday night program,<br>
which we call "Prime Time."  The goal of Prime Time is to communicate Jesus<br>
through all of the most contemporary methods possible.  We accomplish <br>
this through skits, contemporary music, and well-focused speakers.  We had <br>
130 people at our program, double our previous best.<br>
<p>
For the day on Sabbath we expected in our wildest dreams only 200 to come.<br>
But we were blessed with almost 300 young people there.  Randy Wisbey,<br>
of the Youth Resource Center at Andrews University, lined up the various<br>
groups that helped make the day.  Kelli Wright, a student missionary, <br>
gave a talk and an afternoon seminar on mission opportunities.  The<br>
"Impressions" drama group from Andrews University gave some compelling<br>
drama.  Brett Barry, recording artist with Crossroads Records, ministered<br>
mightily through his music and his sharing Jesus.  At the end of the day <br>
he gave a call and many teens stepped forward, saying they wanted to <br>
follow Jesus.  <br>
<p>
Again I'm overwhelmed at the way God is leading in our area.  The local <br>
youth leaders all sense the tremendous sense of responsibility that now<br>
rests on us, discipling this young people.  Praise God and pray for us.<br>

Marcus,<br>
<p>
You raise some good points.  However, part of the campaign of<br>
misinformation constantly waged by the abortion industry is to<br>
imply that a woman and her child, if she carries it to term in a<br>
crisis pregnancy situation, face the bleak certainty of no<br>
support, financial or otherwise, from any avenue, private or<br>
institutional.  This simply isn't true.  There are currently<br>
thousands of crisis pregnancy centers across the country<br>
offering free support services to the mother and child which<br>
range from medical treatment during and after pregnancy, to<br>
housing and job training and financial support while the mother<br>
struggles with what is undoubtedly a very difficult situation. <br>
Most of these centers are Christian, but some are Jewish, some<br>
secular, some feminist.  Unlike Planned Parenthood, which<br>
receives government tax dollar support to maintain its machine,<br>
and unlike abortion "doctors" who earn six figure incomes<br>
killing babies yearly, pro-life support centers are voluntarily<br>
funded and staffed by people who have nothing to gain<br>
financially from a woman in trouble.  CPCs exist, and are growing<br>
every day, and are addressing the very situation you described.<br>
<p>
One problem I have with the "every child a wanted child" slogan<br>
is its unrelatedness to reality.  It's the same thing as saying<br>
that if perfection in a policy area can't be achieved in the<br>
here and now, we should tolerate and even promote death as a<br>
proper and compassionate interim solution.  The problems you<br>
enumerated exist independently of whether abortion continues or<br>
not.  Third world hunger, overpopulation in many areas, unwanted<br>
children, violence in the home, violence in the streets, rape,<br>
murder, genocidal wars...all of these and every other variety of<br>
sin, misery and violence in our world will continue whether or<br>
not every child is wanted.  There simply is no direct one to one<br>
correllation between a child being planned and wanted and that<br>
child growing up to be a perfect citizen.  Many unwanted<br>
children grow up to be wonderful human beings, good parents,<br>
loving husbands and wives.  Many children who were planned and<br>
loved turn out to be human predators.  Many parents who didn't<br>
plan for a child or particularly want it at a certain stage in<br>
life end up being excellent parents as life itself teaches them<br>
the value of that child.  <br>
<p>
And if the unwantedness of an unborn child is just cause for<br>
its death, why not apply the same criteria to infants or<br>
toddlers, many of whom started by being wanted and loved, and<br>
end up being neglected and resented?  Ought society not step in<br>
and end their present and future misery?  Who knows, that dirty<br>
screaming little brat in the canned goods isle being yelled at<br>
by his mother could turn out to be a rapist; shouldn't we<br>
protect him (and others) from a probable life of misery and pain<br>
in the same unfailing way we do the unborn? <br>
<p>
The root problem fueling all others isn't unwanted pregnancies,<br>
it's sin - that bent we all have to do evil unless curbed and<br>
ultimately cured by Jesus.  Until He comes again and puts<br>
an end to sin and suffering, the interim solutions Jesus used are<br>
indeed the best.  Minister to the sick and troubled, give hope<br>
and help to those in less than ideal situations, respect and<br>
value the life God has given to each of us.  <br>
<p>
Joseph <br>

<i>&gt; When the children that are born are all loved, then I'll start picketing</i><br>
<i>&gt; the abortion clinics.</i><br>
<p>
Loved by *WHOM*, though?  Have you ever personally known a couple who had<br>
spent many years on a waiting list to adopt a child?  The length of the<br>
waiting list speaks of the unfulfilled demand for newborn infants to adopt.<br>
Are you implying that if all these couples adopted babies that would have<br>
otherwise been aborted, that they WOULDN'T be loved?  Keeping an "unwanted"<br>
child is not the only alternative to abortion.<br>
<p>
In another post, Marcus expressed concern about the "orphans" who go<br>
unclaimed because they are not aborted.  Given the large number of childless<br>
couples seeking such to adopt, perhaps someone could give details as to WHO<br>
and WHERE these supposedly "unwanted" children are, so that they can be<br>
adopted by those who have been waiting YEARS for that privilege. (Yes,<br>
many of them are willing to accept a handicapped child of another race,<br>
too.) Even in foreign coutries, the "orphan problem" is usually a<br>
result of the massive government red tape in allowing them to be adopted by<br>
"foreigners", rather than a lack of adoptive parents willing to assume that<br>
role.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On the other hand, I do rather value my own life!</i><br>
<p>
As most people who have been allowed to be born do, I suspect. &lt;g&gt;  How<br>
secure is your own life, perhaps in the years to come, if being "unwanted"<br>
or "unloved" (by others) is ever considered grounds for terminating YOUR<br>
life?<br>

Raylene,<br>
<p>
You wrote re: abortion<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;I feel the industry must be maintained.</i><br>
<p>
Its all the big sin problem. I'd rather see children not be given the<br>
chance to live than to grow up unwanted. So many of our societal problems<br>
stem from children being abused or ignored by their parents.<br>
<p>
When the children that are born are all loved, then I'll start picketing the<br>
abortion clinics.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, I do rather value my own life!&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
Unwanted by whom?  The mother and father?  Granted, in a crisis<br>
pregnancy (defined not as a life-threatening pregnancy but any<br>
one in which the mother feels herself in any kind of crisis) the<br>
baby is often not wanted by the mother and father for various<br>
reasons, but this in no way cancels the fact that most of those<br>
babies, if carried to term, are very much wanted by couples who<br>
cannot have children themselves.  A crisis pregnancy center I<br>
work with has found that only about 3% of crisis pregnancies end<br>
with a woman carrying a baby to term and giving it up to<br>
adoption to people who very much want that baby and will provide<br>
it a good home.  Of the women who choose to carry their babies<br>
to term rather than kill them, the vast majority choose to keep<br>
them and raise them themselves - much of the time alone, due to<br>
the "father" suddenly discovering the downside of sex and<br>
beating a hasty retreat.<br>
<p>
Raylene, the sad fact is that abortion, and the lifestyle<br>
changes in our society which have spawned it, have themselves<br>
largely created this "unwanted child" situation.  Prior to the<br>
1960's, almost 90% of unwed mothers carried their children to<br>
term and gave them up for adoption - now it's somewhere in the<br>
neighborhood of 5% nationwide.  Literally millions of<br>
unfulfilled requests for adoption die on the vine every year for<br>
want of babies to adopt, because the dominant culture screams<br>
out at a woman in trouble that the easiest, quickest and least<br>
troublesome way to end a tough situation is to abort her baby.<br>
Granted, there will never be a perfect 1-1 matchup between<br>
babies put up for adoption and couples who want them.  But the<br>
vast majority would, given current unfulfilled demand, be<br>
lovingly cared for in a heartbeat.<br>
<p>
My own opinion is that most people who are pro-choice are so in<br>
spite of the reality of what we know about the fetus at its<br>
earliest stages of development, simply because they can't see<br>
it. It doesn't exist outside the mother, and therefore we can<br>
safely theorize in comfort, passing legislation based on bad<br>
science (like Roe v. Wade) that has devastating effects on<br>
others. Interestingly, when women in crisis pregnancy situations<br>
are shown ultrasound images of their babies, even at very early<br>
stages of development, a growing majority - even of those who<br>
were very much intent on abortion - change their minds and<br>
choose to carry the baby to term.  Suddenly, the reality of what<br>
and who is inside them is graphically and visually shown them,<br>
and the lies they've been told by Planned Parenthood and others<br>
that their baby is just a blob of tissue are forcefully<br>
exposed. It is, after the baby who's life is taken from it, the<br>
woman who is most exploited by the abortion industry.  <br>
<p>
Despite misinformation to the contrary, the pro-life movement is<br>
largely populated by women, many of them post-abortal.  From the<br>
pain and suffering they've gone through has come their<br>
conviction and commitment to help others in like situations, and<br>
their stories are poignant and real.  If you'd like, email me your<br>
snailmail address, and I'll be happy to send you or anyone else<br>
some information on them.  God bless,<br>
<p>
Joseph <br>

Joseph I admire your stand on counting unborn fetuses as<br>
living beings.  The point I feel that many of us Pro-Lifers<br>
miss, is that life does not end at birth.  The fetus is not on its<br>
own once born.  The parent(s) isn't/aren't on his/her/their own.<br>
What government agency will track parents to babies who<br>
might be orphaned?  Will the Church do it?  Where is the<br>
money going to come from to provide for _all_ would be<br>
aborted babies?  Where will the earth hold all the people?<br>
How will the cities survive with the expedited population<br>
increasing?  How will we manage the earth?  Who will be<br>
responsible for making sure people aren't living "reckless<br>
and 'valueless lifestyles'?"  (Note:  They _do_ have values,<br>
just not some of the ones you might have.  Or maybe they<br>
have values like you in this area but felt that they had to<br>
make a choice against the nature of those values.  Neither of<br>
us are judge since we aren't those people.)<br>
<p>
Who will provide families for _all_ unwanted babies?<br>
Is physical life without a family that wants you, better than not<br>
having lived in the first place?  Who will support youth who<br>
are disowned by families?<br>
<p>
Are we good stewards of the earth and keepers of each other<br>
in continually having new babies while many others that are<br>
already born are without families, complaining any time tax<br>
is needed to support them?<br>
<p>
The point is, is that we _don't_, we *do NOT*, know anything<br>
on the personal situations of many, nor on concrete alternatives<br>
to keep this planet from plunging into chaos of greater cosmic<br>
proportion, through over-population, or infringement of certain<br>
governmental rights, or privacy.<br>
<p>
(A perfect cartoon I saw recently had a multitude of hungry,<br>
apparently malnourished people, holding empty bowls, from<br>
foreground to infinity.  In the sky were the words,<br>
"Global Over-population," Also in the foreground was a notable<br>
"clergy" who had blinders on (like those put on work animals)<br>
but these were in the appearance of a Bible.  On the inside of one<br>
of the "blinders" were the words "Be Fruitful and Multiply."<br>
He stood smiling with hands cupped in "praying position" while<br>
pained faces were all around.<br>

Joseph,<br>
<p>
You share some excellent observations.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that we agree in practice more than we disagree in principle.<br>
Undoubtedly, the buzz words need to go, for there is no either/or to "pro-life"<br>
or "pro-choice."  Both supposed sides are at once "pro-life" and "pro-choice,"<br>
it's just that their focus, and the reasoning behind it is different.  <br>
Who's life<br>
and choices get consideration, and why?<br>
<p>
Here are four considerations (I'm sure there are many others) that seem<br>
to be missing from dialogues (do they exist?) on this issue.<br>
<p>
1) Freedom of choice a woman or a couple should have in using abortion.<br>
_Lack of_ freedom to choose NOT to have an abortion (I think that in China,<br>
abortion isn't an option in some cases, its mandatory), or to not pay tax<br>
for support of abortion.<br>
<p>
2) In spite of the wonderful work of crisis pregnancy clinics, too many<br>
children continue to be born in poverty by single mothers, or placed in<br>
orphanages where the older they get the more difficult it is to find a family<br>
(Not a small issue are some requirements for adoption that are still in<br>
place in many areas).  Parents are returning for kids they once gave<br>
to adoption, further disrupting their lives.<br>
<p>
Within this is the need for economic compensation and educational<br>
support for single or coupled women who carry the pregnancy to term.<br>
Or have the baby adapted.<br>
<p>
3) Picking and choosing where one wants their tax money to be<br>
spent will open up an economic "slippery slope" if you will... (for those<br>
familiar with this playing card in stirring up fears.)  ; )  Say for instance,<br>
if I want to stop my tax money from going to military spending,<br>
or subsidizing _tax breaks_ for some "religio-political" organizations?<br>
What grounds can be basis for exemption?  Will it be fair for other<br>
areas?<br>
<p>
4) Some people groups have, here to for, incurable, fatal genetic diseases<br>
in their population that don't appear in other groups.  Case in point, the<br>
Mediterranean community I posted about in "Eugenics....".  Should the<br>
rule against abortion, in general, apply without exception?<br>
<p>
Anyway, again I have no answers to impose on others, only a request<br>
for in depth, prayerful and loving dialogue/actions on this issue.<br>
<p>

I'll go look it up.  If you will go to any large grocery store chain, it<br>
is currently on the check out lines.  I think it is the SUN, or something<br>
similar.  It is the really far out one, the one that shows detailed <br>
photos of nessie etc. etc.  Virtually nothing that they print has any basis<br>
in fact<br>
Cheers<br>

I finaly got to see what internet is all about.  The UT library has a public<br>
internet terminal.  So out of curiosity, I logged in as per directions, and<br>
called up a list of gophers, after wading through a couple of menus, I found<br>
the Andrews gopher.  It was eye opening.  I decided to access JeWeL, and look<br>
up a book that I had the library aquire back in 1975 or so for me.  Sure<br>
enough, it is still there.  "The Making of a Genius" by Aron Stern.  A<br>
facinating book.  This man essentially programmed his daughter.  She had<br>
her PHD by the time she was 16 I think.  It details the steps that he went<br>
through, and his thesis through out the book, is that with proper training<br>
you can make any kid into a genius.  Now, The real question, and one<br>
for Harvey, is "How many times has this book been checked out".  The<br>
first checkout is of course, me, but it would be interesting to know of<br>
any others.  I would hope it got some use.  JeWeL is nice.  <br>
Cheers<br>

the spirit is the "breath of life". That is amply born out throughout<br>
the bible, and is in fact, a main tenent of our stance on the state of<br>
the dead.  Therefore the fetus becomes a person at birth...<br>
I personally, feel that the current guidlines are fine.  They hold that<br>
if the fetus would have a chance of surviving if born at that time, then<br>
abortion is not permitted except to save the life of the mother, or in<br>
severe congenital deformities (Generaly this is at the start of the<br>
third tri-mester, or at 6 months of gestation).<br>
Before that, it would be a non-survivable situation.  This makes perfect<br>
sense to a zoologist like me.<br>
Cheers<br>

Romans 14 lets me know that abortion is one of those topics<br>
which a person needs to be convicted in their own heart.<br>

Hi,<br>
  My wife and I are doing some long range goal planning and part of that is<br>
determining what the quality of education is in Adventist private schools. I guess what<br>
we are looking for is test scores that indicate the level of academic achievement for<br>
the school. i.e. 3rd grade children testing at 6th+ grade level, Average SAT's 1100+, etc.,<br>
Our Adventist education system has always been assumed to be high quality and what <br>
we need is hard evidence that proves it for us to base our decisions on. Our view is that a <br>
good educational system can pursue the highest academic standards without sacrificing <br>
the same level of committment to spiritual education. <br>
 <br>
 Thoughts,Statistics?<br>

Well, the blessed event finally happened!   Our twins (a girl and a boy)<br>
were born and they will have their own identity in having their own birthday<br>
as well.<br>
<p>
              Sarah Katharine Edwards was born on August 11th at 11:54 pm.<br>
 		She weighed in at 7 lbs. 5 oz. and was 20.5 inches in length.<br>
	  	She was in perfect health, except for being born with a<br>
 		cleft lip and cleft palate which can easily be repaired.<br>
                In spite of the cleft lip and palate, she is able to nurse<br>
                with a little assistance.      <br>
<p>
	       Brian Matthew Edwards was born on August 12th at 12:08 am.<br>
 		He weighed in at 6 lbs. 13 oz. and was 19.5 inches in length.<br>
		He was in perfect health, although he had a minor problem with<br>
		rapid breathing at first (which is not unusual for early<br>
                births, 4 weeks before term, and especially with the smaller <br>
                of twins).  He was in ICU for a few hours and has been moved<br>
                to the progressive care nursery and should be back in the<br>
                well baby nursery by sometime Sabbath afternoon. <br>
                  <br>
<p>
We were a little surprised and Sandra's (my wife) first reaction after Sarah<br>
was born was turning to me and saying I'm sorry.  Both the doctor and I told<br>
her that it was not her fault or anyone's fault (except possibly the<br>
old devil's) and that it will be easily repairable to the point where no one<br>
should even notice later on; for I am living proof of what can be done, and<br>
medicine/surgery has progressed quite abit in the past 37 years.<br>
<p>
I/We appreciate everyone's prayers up to this point and I request that you<br>
continue praying for the following requests:<br>
<p>
               1.  That the Lord will guide and direct the surgeon's hands,<br>
                   mind, etc. as he performs the first of several surgeries<br>
                   sometime next week on Sarah.<br>
               2.  That the Lord will continue to draw close to my wife and<br>
                   reassure her that He is able to turn this minor twist<br>
                   into a positive outcome! and that Sarah is truly our<br>
                   "pure princess" (which is essentially what her name<br>
                   means). <br>
<p>
               3.  That He will guide and direct us in our finances and<br>
                   to where He wants us to be as far as employment for<br>
                   me.<br>
<p>
The Lord is good and as He has promised in Psalms 89:33,34 (RSV)<br>
"but I will not remove from him my steadfast love, or be false to<br>
my faithfulness.  I will not violate my covenant OR alter the word <br>
that went forth from my lips."<br>
<p>
Hope everyone had a joyous beginning to their Sabbath and has a blessed<br>
Sabbath day.<br>
<p>

I personally think that this question is at least partially answered by<br>
the first half (apprx.) of Dr. Sakae Kubo's book "God Meets Man: A Theology<br>

<i>&gt; What does the Bible mean when it says that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath?</i><br>
<p>
I've always interpreted that as applying to the case where Sabbath keeping<br>
becomes an end in and of itself, a "badge of righteousness", etc.  There are<br>
many examples of overriding principles which may actually supersede the<br>
letter of the ordinance itself, and Jesus even alluded to some of these.<br>
<p>
Take, for example, the case of a man whose house catches fire on Saturday.<br>
Although extinguishing the fire, technically, is "labor", if Sabbath is<br>
really "made for man" and his benefit, then rigidly interpreting it to<br>
prohibit doing something necessary is obviously contradicting the stated<br>
purpose.  Jesus cited the example of a man whose ox fell into a pit on<br>
Sabbath.  Winding up with a dead ox for the sake of conformity to an<br>
ordinance would not benefit the owner of the ox.  In a more contemporary<br>
context, how many SDAs would stop to change a flat tire that occurred on the<br>
way to or from Sabbath services?  Most, I'd guess.<br>
<p>
One historical event worth noting is the Maccabean revolt.  The Jewish<br>
rebels at first refused to fight on Sabbath, but this "rule" became an<br>
obvious weakness, and they finally fought on Sabbath and prevailed.  It must<br>
also be remembered that Joshua's march around Jerich lasted for seven<br>
consecutive days, one of which obviously was the Sabbath.<br>
<p>
I've often wondered aboout those who "labor" on Sabbath, such as SDA<br>
pastors, ushers, organists, and SS teachers.  Do they "keep" Sunday as a day<br>
of rest to compensate for their Sabbath labors?<br>

<i>&gt; crime as his sire?</i><br>
<p>
It's an interesting hypothesis, although I think the figures show that only<br>
a tiny fraction of the elective abortions are for the reasons you have<br>
stated as acceptable.  The Bible, however, speaks to the question of<br>
executing a child because his father was a criminal:<br>
<p>
Ezek 18:19 "Yet you ask, `Why does the son not share the guilt<br>
           of his father?' Since the son has done what is just<br>
           and right and has been careful to keep all my<br>
           decrees, he will surely live. (NIV)<br>
<p>
Ezek 18:20 The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son<br>
           will not share the guilt of the father, nor will<br>
           the father share the guilt of the son. The<br>
           righteousness of the righteous man will be credited<br>
           to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be<br>
           charged against him. (NIV)<br>
<p>
The fact is, the Bible advocating judging the son on his own merits, rather<br>
than engaging in a "preemptive first strike" based on the theory that he<br>
MIGHT follow in his father's footsteps.  Another thing you've overlooked is<br>
a greater than 50% probability that a rapist's offspring might be FEMALE. To<br>
carry your idea to its logical conclusion, you'd have to at least wait until<br>
the child was born and determine his/her gender prior to doing a "preventive<br>
execution", since presumably few baby girls grow up to be "rapists".<br>
<p>
Like I said, it's an interesting hypothesis, but I don't even think the<br>
so-called "pro choice" camp is actively promoting THAT idea as justification<br>
for the MILLIONS of abortions performed every year.<br>
<p>
The other nasty side effect of that theory is that it undermines the role of<br>
a person's free will and responsibility for his/her actions.  Would you like<br>
to see accused rapists turned lose on the theory that "my father was a<br>
rapist, so I was genetically pre-disposed to be one, too"?  If you want to<br>
eliminate rape, you'd have to try the tactics of Pharaoh and Herod, and kill<br>
ALL the male children.<br>

<p>
The following was posted to another list to which I subscribe.<br>

what the gay community is doing to advance their claim to <br>
special treatment as a group which is discriminated against.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Resolution on Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Youths in the Schools</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Adopted by the American Psychological Association Council of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Representatives on Feb. 28, 1993, and by the National Association of School</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Psychologists on Jan. 16, 1993.  For more information, contact the</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; 301-608-0500.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Whereas society's attitudes, behaviors, and tendency to render lesbian, gay</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and bisexual persons invisible permeate all societal institutions including</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the family and school system; (Gonsiorek, 1988; Hetrick and Martin, 1988;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Ponse, 1978; Uribe and Harbeck, 1992)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Whereas it is a presumption that all persons, including those who are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; lesbian, gay or bisexual, have the right to equal opportunity within all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; public educational institutions;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Whereas current literature suggests that some youths are aware of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; status as lesbian, gay or bisexual persons by early adolescence; (Remafedi,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1987; Savin-Williams, 1990; Slater, 1988; Troiden, 1988:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Whereas many lesbian, gay and bisexual youths and youths perceived to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; belong to these groups face harassment and physical violence in school</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; environments; (Freiberg, 1987; Hetrick &amp; Martin, 1988; Remafedi, 1987;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Schaecher, 1988; Uribe and Harbeck, 1992; Whitlock, 1988)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Whereas many lesbian, gay and bisexual youths are at risk for lowered</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; self-esteem and for engaging in self-injurious behaviors, including</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; suicide; (Hetrick and Martin, 1988; Gonsiorek, 1988; Savin-Williams, 1990;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Harry, 1989; Gibson, 1989)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Whereas gay male and bisexual youths are at an increased risk of HIV</i><br>

George,<br>
<p>
How lucky you are!  Your wife didn't have an abortion in any sense<br>
of the word, which is why you have two LIVING children.  Were we<br>
to know what besetting sins you and your wife fight against every<br>
day, might we conclude that your two children were better off<br>
killed before birth so they don't grow up to commit the same sins<br>
as you?  <br>
<p>
I'm puzzled as to why it's so easy for people to speak of death as<br>
a better "option" than life, when only the living can express<br>
their opinions on the matter, never the dead babies who have been<br>
denied the opportunity to experience life for themselves?<br>

Fred,<br>
<p>
A moving story, and I agree Elder Finley used great wisdom in<br>
answering the woman.  Her story points up the fact that the<br>
overwhelming number of abortions are performed as a form of<br>
post-conception birth control, and have nothing to do with the<br>
usual hypotheticals of rape, incest and danger to the mother. <br>
Sadly, women have been the ones hurt the most, and men have<br>
profited the most from legalized abortion.  Men want the fun and<br>
excitement of sex without the responsibilities, and women are made<br>
to bear the burden.  Thinking, under pressure as in Elder Finley's<br>
story, that abortion will provide a solution to the problem, women<br>
often consent to pressure from the man, only to find that they<br>
suffer from post-abortion syndrom, which manifests itself in a<br>
variety of ways.  Depression and anger are common, and a deep<br>
seated sense of guilt sometimes torments the woman for years,<br>
especially when she later carries a wanted baby to term.  <br>
<p>
If our society is so concerned that the rights of women who are<br>
the victims of rape, incest or who have problem pregnancies be<br>
protected, then do so.  But need we continue the abortion on<br>
demand industry so that men and women can pursue a reckless and<br>
valueless lifestyle at the expense of innocent children?<br>

Harvey,<br>
<p>
Detailed replies to your points on the sanctuary will follow<br>
shortly, but one point I wish to make clear at the outset: I don't<br>
allow Ellen White's writings to "explain" or "interpret" the Bible<br>
for me.  To do so is simply to set her above Scripture, something<br>
you of course are at liberty to do, but which I will not.  The<br>
points I raise regarding the sanctuary as discussed by Paul in<br>
Hebrews will be confined to that epistle and other Bible material<br>
bearing on it.  To forestall your (probable) next question, yes, I<br>
believe sister White was a fully inspired prophet of God.  I do<br>
not accept her writings as canonical, which she herself denied. <br>
Either we examine the Bible without recourse to her writings as<br>
final arbiter, or we do not believe in "the Bible, and the Bible<br>
alone."  I'm setting this forth now so that we don't get<br>
sidetracked into a discussion of the inspiration of the Spirit of<br>
Prophecy, which is a worthy topic in itself, but not the topic at<br>
hand.<br>

I don't see mention of a mobile throne in that passage.  What it does say<br>
is the following:<br>
<p>
  "I saw the Father rise from the throne, and in a flaming chariot<br>
   go into the holy of holies within the veil, and sit down.  Then<br>
   Jesus rose up from the throne, . . . .  Then a cloudy chariot,<br>
   with wheels like flaming fire, surrounded by angels, came to<br>
   where Jesus was.  He stepped into the chariot and was borne to<br>
   the holiest, where the Father sat."  (EW 55)<br>

<i>&gt; I do find a bit of a problem with the Bible texts which speak of God</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a being which does not cast a shadow...a shadow of turning as one</i><br>
<i>&gt; text says.</i><br>
<p>
The NIV translation of that verse, reprinted below, avoids that problem.<br>
<p>
  "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from<br>
   the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like<br>
   shifting shadows."  (James 1:17, NIV)<br>
<p>
There are no other texts which might even imply that God does not cast a<br>
shadow.  Also the word for 'shadow' in James 1:17 occurs only in that<br>
verse.  Several other verses speak of God's shadow, however.  In most, if<br>
not all, cases, shadow is used figuratively in the sense of protection. <br>
Whether or not God casts a physical shadow is a moot question, IMHO.<br>
<p>
  "He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High<br>
    will rest in the shadow of the Almighty."  (Psalm 91:1, NIV)<br>
<p>
Four verses in Psalms (17:8; 36:7; 57:1; 63:7) use the phrase "under the<br>
shadow of [God's] wings." <br>
<p>
Two verses in Isaiah (49:2; 51:16) use the phrase "in the shadow of [God's]<br>
hand."<br>
<p>
Consider also the following verses: Psalm 121:5; Isaiah 25:4; Luke 1:35.<br>
Song of Songs 2:3 might also apply.<br>

With some of the theological beliefs about life in Eden changing<br>
after the "fall", I wonder if God created skunks in Eden. And<br>
if there were skunks in Eden, why were they equipped with such<br>
a stink...<br>
<p>
Just wondering...were there skunks in Eden?<br>

<p>
P.S. Will there be skunks in heaven?<br>

Congrats, Tony, you now know one.  I am pro-choice and don't mind<br>
saying so.  I believe that all knowlege is a learned thing, and that a<br>
pre-born has no way of aquireing any knowlege, therefore is not a<br>
human being in the normal sense of the word.  It is, a physiological<br>
human body, but not an individual yet.  That does not start happening<br>
until at birth.<br>
If a feotus is non-viable, then I have absolutly no problem with aborting<br>
it.<br>
Cheers<br>
Woody<br>

Bill, does a lightbulb cast a shadow?  How can a being of pure light<br>
brilliantly radiant cast a shadow?<br>

Dave, as usual poses another interesting question.  Where do these come<br>
from???   he writes" I've often wondered about those who 'labor' on<br>
Sabbath, such as SDA pastors, ushers, organists and ss Teachers.<br>
As one of these "laborers" (a usher, deacon, SS teacher, and instrumentist)<br>
I can assure you that these are not "labors".  They are activities that<br>
mean a good deal to me.  They are part of being able to unwind.  I can't<br>
begin to tell you how many co-workers of mine have expressed amazement<br>
and admiration about the way that I can just lay everything down and forget<br>
about it for a day.  I have actually had co-workers tell me that they<br>
envy my ability to do this.  I try to share with them that they could<br>
do the same, but few ever do.  My personal opinion, is that if Sunday<br>
keepers would observe Sunday the way that Adventists observe Sabbath,<br>
they would gain a much greater and deeper blessing.  You don't know<br>
just how sweet it is to totaly forget your work concerns, and everything<br>
else and really rest and recharge.  Teaching SS and playing my<br>
instrument is a vital part of that recharging process for me.<br>
(I play the banjo, fiddle, and am working on the steel-drums, slowly<br>
I might add.  For something as simple looking as a steel pan, it is<br>
amazing how difficult it is to learn to play.<br>
<p>
Cheers<br>

When I get home from the last meeting on Sabbath (sometimes after midnight),<br>
I often unwind by "lerking" through the mail. Tonight was church board in my<br>
largest church.  We had a long agenda.  As I read thtough, I decided to<br>
respond to several things at once.<br>
<p>
 Although I did not know Dr. Hasel well, it hurts to know of his death.  I<br>
respected and admired him for his work, and his attitude.  I will feel the<br>
poorer knowing that he is no longer using his abilities for God.<br>
<p>
As to the rolling thrones...Our church has been studying Ezekiel in Prayer<br>
meeting, and as a matter of fact Ezekiel 1,3,10,11 and Daniel 7 all mention<br>
wheels in connection with the presence of God and His throne.  Does God use<br>
machinery...Or I.D. cards?  Can He understand computers?  If not, why not?<br>
 Maybe there's more of a reflection of God in humanity than we have realized!<br>
<p>
The discussion about pastors has been interesting and enlightening to me.  I<br>
often wonder what people's thoughts are, and I think that MOST of my church<br>
members are too nice to tell me their true thoughts when they are unhappy<br>
with something..  (Not that I feel unloved)  <br>
<p>
Here in Texas, our new conference president, Elder Steve Gifford has given<br>
each church a packet setting out a proceedure for finding a new pastor when a<br>
vacency occurs.  When I handed one to one of my Elders, he gave me a real<br>
strange look, untill I told him to keep it for the future.  The process<br>
involves communication between the church(es) and the conference on<br>
preferences, but the conference holds the last say.<br>
<p>
My wife is having a fusion on her neck Monday a week.  She has been in a lot<br>
of pain for a long time.  I covet your prayers for her.<br>
<p>
Well, I'm out for the night.<br>
<p>
God Bless you all<br>
<p>

<p>
   Hello,<br>
<p>
   How are you?  I saw your message prior to Sabbath Friday and became <br>
excited that 'Europe' has the insight in using a BBS system with the <br>
Internet.  I'm an expert in the setting-up and maintenance of TBBS BBS <br>
systems.  TBBS is the world's leader in corporate BBS systems and is <br>
multi-lingual, also.<br>
<p>
   I've done a large amount of consulting and have setup BBSes for Canon, <br>
CSULB, CPI, and governmental agencies.  I'm also very well versed in the <br>
Internet.  *PLUS*, TBBS is releasing a new, yet already beta tested, <br>
IPAD--The Internet Protocol Adapter.  The *only* PC software/hardware <br>
program that can do all Internet features on a PC.  For example, TELNET, <br>
FTPing, PING, FINGER, and full domain server functions.  <br>
<p>
  I'm not sure if you're looking for someone to just help you, sell to <br>
you, come over there and setup, or what exactly.  Please give me a <br>
snailmail address (regular address) and I will mail you complete <br>
information plus some other good things.  <br>
<p>
  Feel free to e-mail me here or at bishop@csulb.edu anytime!<br>
<p>
  Thank you and God richly bless you in this project!<br>

Bill,<br>
<p>
The vision recorded in Ezekiel 1 and following is just that- a<br>
vision.  Visions communicate truth to us via symbols, such as the<br>
wheels within wheels that have puzzled Bible students for<br>
centuries.  No one seriously believes God was showing Ezekiel<br>
literal circles of wheels flying about in heaven; rather, He is<br>
communicating something of spiritual significance to us in<br>
symbol.  For someone to postulate that because Ezekiel saw wheels<br>
on God's throne the literal throne of God in heaven must also have<br>
wheels is to miss the meaning of the vision by a mile.  If<br>
everything shown in visions were literal, then we ought to believe<br>
that Jesus has snow white hair, eyes that burn with fire, legs of<br>
burnished to the color of brass, and so on.  When He speaks, we<br>
ought to expect to see a literal sword flash from His mouth, and<br>
when He addresses the wicked, we should witness Him thrash them<br>
with a literal rod of iron.  Obviously, we understand these things<br>
to be symbolic, just as the wheels of Ezekiel are symbolic.<br>
<p>
If the throne of God truly does have wheels making it mobile, why<br>
didn't He indicate such on the type, the ark of the covenant which<br>
always sat in the MHP of the tabernacle and sanctuary?  Here is<br>
the best representation we have of God's throne, and we don't find<br>
wheels at all.  It was always stationary, and always found in the<br>
MHP.  If types teach us about antitypes, then we ought to draw a<br>
reasonable correlation between the ark and God's throne in heaven.<br>
<p>
Another problem with conjecturing a mobile throne in heaven is<br>
that it somehow strikes one as a bit absurd.  What need does God<br>
have for a mobile throne?  And with infinite power at His command,<br>
with His throne room surrounded by beings who fly, why should He<br>
choose to place His throne on wheels to gain mobility?  Isn't this<br>
concept a bit of an insult to God?<br>
<p>
This idea is really just an attempt to get around the plain words<br>
of Paul in Hebrews that Christ had already entered into the MHP of<br>
the heavenly sanctuary in his day.  I'm recuperating from an<br>
allergic reaction to a wasp sting today, so I'll elaborate<br>
tomorrow.<br>

 From Bill Sands, Jr.<br>
<p>
In the New Testament we are told to praise the Lord no matter what.<br>
After reading that passage I began to wonder HOW we offer praise,<br>
especially when times arise where death and misfortune surround us.<br>
What constitutes offering praise? Is it only done in song? Or can<br>
it be merely an attitude? Does it have to be done out loud, or in<br>
a group, or by ourselves?<br>
<p>
For example, I am in absolute awe when I go out for a walk in the<br>
forest or through a vineyard (we have many of both in Michigan). Does<br>
a mental attitude of happiness and joy constitute praise to God?<br>
<p>
I also am in awe when I consider the many mechanical things which<br>
humanity has devised--the 747, the internal combustion engine,<br>
the many improvements in planting and harvesting.<br>
<p>
Those happy thoughts easily generate praise! But what about tragedy<br>
and sorrow? How do we praise God in our tears and fears? When an<br>
innocent child is shot by accident and dies--how do we praise at<br>
times like that?<br>
<p>
When a woman is raped and murdered in the big city or small town,<br>
how does her father and mother, or lover, or children praise God?<br>
Why would they want to offer praise?<br>
<p>
What does it mean to praise God no matter what?<br>
<p>
Is it unrealistic? Is it stretching the meaning of the text <br>
to say that whatever happens--praise the Lord?<br>
<p>
Any ideas?<br>
<p>
Bill Sands, Jr.<br>

<p>
Even in times of tragedy, we can praise God that sin will not continue<br>
forever.<br>
<p>
One important aspect of praising God that Bill did not explicitly state,<br>
perhaps because it's so obvious, is that we not only feel awe or joy,<br>
but that we give credit to God.<br>

I heard the close of probation best explained in a sermon by <br>
Smuts Van Rooyen.<br>
<p>
He points out that the common perception of the "close of probation"<br>
is actually putting people *on* probation--(better not mess up after<br>
the close of probation since there is no mediator).<br>
<p>
He points to the legal system and notes that in the legal sense, when <br>
your probation is up, the court has no more claims against you and <br>
you are free to go. The heavenly probation works the same way,<br>
Once it has been shown that you have been justified by Christ,<br>
there is no need to keep you on probation. <br>
<p>
Hope this helps....<br>

Too often the debate "abortion is murder" turns into a definition contest<br>
with various people disputing when life begins. <br>
<p>
One thing that is not in dispute, however, is that once a sperm and ovum<br>
unite, a unique combination of genes is created which has the potential to grow<br>
into a living human being.  I think the debate could sometimes be carried<br>
farther if we were to say:  "all right, the fetus may not be alive, but<br>
it has a unique potential for life.  How shall we protect that potential life?"<br>

Woody points out that the life is in the breath...<br>
I maintain that as Scripture teaches, the life is in the BLOOD.<br>
<p>
However, I still stand by Romans 14 as a guide for governing<br>
a disputation over abortion. Let each one be convinced in their<br>
own mind.<br>

To Jesse Lambeth (and others interested)<br>
<p>
Check with your Union Conference (not the state conf) Education<br>
Secretary or whatever the title might be. In the Lake Union the<br>
Education Dept. does an annual audit of the educational situation<br>
at the various academies. Nearly every aspect of educational<br>
situation is covered including standardized testing results,<br>
and various other comparisons. It is available to any SDA parent<br>
interested in the info. You may have to simply go to the Union Conf<br>
office and sit down with the big binder and read it there, but it<br>
is worth it.<br>
<p>
Grades from individual schools should be available--like the<br>
Nelson Denny reading test, and others like the California Aptitude<br>
or SAT.<br>
<p>
Just poke around and ask the educators near where you live.<br>

Joseph,<br>
<p>
Why try to make everything revealed about God into a symbol<br>
which might mean something else. The writer of Ezekiel and<br>
Hebrews and Daniel seem to have a good grasp of their God and<br>
God's spiritual aspects.<br>
<p>
They used their eyes and then their brains and then their tongues<br>
and pens to share what they have been shown.<br>
<p>
If they saw "wheel-like" things that is what they saw. Something<br>
capable of transporting through space and it had wheels.<br>
<p>
As far as the question: When did Jesus enter the Most Holy Place,<br>
there is no question that he entered when he ascended. What we don<br>
do not know is how many times Jesus has entered the MHP in his<br>
ministrations. The earthly High Priest entered the MHP at least<br>
five times on the day of atonement.<br>

In-Reply-&gt;To: &lt;9408142141.AA29666@edmund&gt; from "SDA Net" at Aug 14, 94 05:41:34 pm<br>
<p>
[SDA Net writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; I heard the close of probation best explained in a sermon by </i><br>
<i>&gt; Smuts Van Rooyen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; [..]</i><br>
<i>&gt; He points to the legal system and notes that in the legal sense, when </i><br>
<i>&gt; your probation is up, the court has no more claims against you and </i><br>
<i>&gt; you are free to go. The heavenly probation works the same way,</i><br>
<p>
According to Webster's, "probation" can have these meanings:<br>
1)  critical examination and evaluation or subjection to such examination<br>
    and evaluation;<br>
2a) subjection of an individual to a period of testing and trial to<br>
    ascertain fitness;<br>
2b) the action of suspending the sentence of a convicted offender and giving<br>
    him freedom during good behavior under the supervision of a probation<br>
    officer<br>
<p>
Our time on earth is indeed a time of ascertaining our fitness for heaven<br>
(delaying for the moment what constitutes that fitness), so the "2a"<br>
meaning seems a good description.  It also seems that "2b" is a good<br>
description.  Permit me to elaborate.<br>
<p>
Adam and Eve were created in the physical, mental, and spiritual image of<br>
God (Gen 1:26).  God had great plans for them, but first their trust in<br>
and loyalty to God must tested (Gen 2:16,17) [1]; they were on probation.<br>
When they disobeyed God's clear command [2] and violated the terms of their<br>
probation [3], judgment would have been executed against them (eternal<br>
death), had not Jesus interposed (Rev 13:8), saying, "Let the punishment<br>
fall upon me" (cf. Isa ch.53).  This obtained for Adam and Eve a second<br>
chance, a second probation.  What love!  What mercy!  What grace!<br>
<p>
We, who were born after -- born physically, mentally, spiritually, and<br>
morally weakened -- are beneficiaries of that second probation (albeit<br>
the first for us).  The terms of this probation are basically the same<br>
(Rom 6:23, 8:6, 1 John 3:4), except for one important difference - God<br>
now supplies the desire and power to obey which we lack (Phi 2:13).<br>
Will we accept these gifts?<br>
<p>
During this time of probation, God has a plan of redemption, a plan of<br>
restoration.  This plan has two aspects (yet they are one, like siamese<br>
twins):  One part addresses the problem of our sins, the other the problem<br>
of Sin.  Jesus is the center of both.  By His death as our Substitute, we are<br>
reconciled; by His life as our Example, we are saved (Rom 5:10, Mat 1:21).<br>
Both have as their purpose to restore mankind to the image of God.  While<br>
our restoration physically and mentally has its limits and does not fully<br>
occur until Christ's coming (1 Cor 15:53,54), the restoration of our<br>
character, the spiritual/moral image of God, is not so limited (Eph 4:22-24;<br>
Col 3:9,10; Rom 12:2; Phi 2:5; Heb 8:10/Jer 31:33; 2 Pet 1:4).  Indeed,<br>
the character developed here on earth is the character taken to heaven,<br>
if it is fit for heaven.  Oh Lord, recreate me in Your image!<br>
<p>
The provisions made possible by Jesus' life, death, and resurrection are<br>
available to all.  But all will not benefit.  What is the key that unlocks<br>
this storehouse?  A belief, a faith, a trust in God that surrenders all,<br>
nothing held back, no double mind/heart.  The proof of this belief, this<br>
faith, this trust that God says what He means and means what He says is<br>
a life of obedience.  "Well done, good and faithful servant.  Enter into<br>
the joy of your Lord."<br>
<p>
[1] Note that the test was the lightest possible; there was not the slightest<br>
    need for Adam and Eve to eat of the forbidden tree.  Moreover Satan's<br>
    rebellion in heaven was explained to them and they were warned that he<br>
    would try to ensnare them.<br>
[2] Eve reckoned she could take a risk and not get conned (Jer 9:23,24),<br>
    while Adam could not conceive of there being any solution (cf. Isa 42:16)<br>
    to the problem he faced.  Each had their rationalization for distrusting<br>
    and disobeying God's command.<br>
[3] Trust and obey .. and live; distrust and disobey .. and die.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Once it has been shown that you have been justified by Christ,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is no need to keep you on probation. </i><br>
<p>
Once justified, then no more on probation?!  Sounds like "once saved, always<br>
saved".  Sounds like "evangelical Adventism".  I submit that the parable<br>
of Mat 18:23-35 teaches us that probation continues even after forgiveness,<br>
that our sins can come back upon our heads and we can lose that justification.<br>
BTW, our sins are not blotted out (Acts 3:19; cf Jer 17:1) until the times<br>
of refreshing, which occur at the end of the anti-typical Day of Atonement.<br>

Hello!<br>
<p>
I have heard some opinions that 144 000 represent real Jews people who will<br>
be saved. I don't think much about this until I read in my Good News Bible -<br>
Today's English Version (from Harper Collins Publishers) verses in Romans <br>
11,12.25.<br>
 	"Then how much greater the blessings will be when the complete<br>
	 number of Jews is included.! (v. 12)<br>
	 "... that the stubborness of the people of Israel is not permanent..."<br>
	 (v.25)<br>
What do you think? Is the 144 000 nubmer of real Jews who will be saved in<br>
last days? (I now that E.G.W. wrote that she will be maybe in 144 000, but<br>
verses up are interesting).<br>
What do you think about this verses? In SDA BC vol 6 dosen't write more <br>
about this verses.<br>
<p>
Have a nice day!<br>

Bill Sands asked:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When a woman is raped and murdered in the big city or small town,</i><br>
<i>&gt; how does her father and mother, or lover, or children praise God?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why would they want to offer praise?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What does it mean to praise God no matter what?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is it unrealistic? Is it stretching the meaning of the text </i><br>
<i>&gt; to say that whatever happens--praise the Lord?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any ideas?</i><br>
<p>
It's GOD that you're praising, not the circumstances.  Job did that.  He<br>
didn't "thank God" for the calamities, but rather for the fact that a loving<br>
God had a purpose, albeit unknown to him, for everything He allowed to<br>
happen to Job.<br>
<p>
Scripture says "*IN* everything give thanks", not "*FOR* everything".<br>
There's a difference.<br>
<p>
I can't claim a Job-like experience in my life, but I've had calamities in<br>
my life that I wondered how a loving God would allow.  In some of them, I've<br>
subsequently learned the answers, and in others I'm still waiting to be<br>
enlightened.  Many of them have boiled down to God removing "good" things<br>
from my life to make room for "better" things.<br>
<p>
These are principles that are best learned beforehand, because once you're<br>
faced with a seemingly "disaster", they tend to seem like pious platitudes.<br>
Romans 8:28 is the classic example of that.  I believe it's true, but it's<br>
not always tactful to quote that to a person in their hour of trouble and<br>
grief.  In the specific case you cited, one *COULD* speculate, but some<br>
things are better left unsaid.  There's a wonderful book writen by a<br>
Christian woman who was raped, became pregnant, gave the baby up for<br>
adoption, only to have the daughter search for her mother years later and be<br>
joyfully reunited.  That's an example of what God *CAN* do, but who's to say<br>
what He *WILL* do?  If the woman is dead in this case, then that's obviously<br>
not going to happen, of course.<br>
<p>
Consider the murder of Stephen.  Many believe that his death was one of the<br>
catalysts in the conversion of the apostle Paul.  The point being, sometimes<br>
the death of a single person has been used by God to set in action a chain<br>
of events that can benefit thousands or even millions of people.  That<br>
doesn't condone the criminal actions, of course, any more than the betrayal<br>
of Jesus which led to His death and our salvation justifies Judas' actions.<br>

I am addressing Tony Dyson's and George Tasker's comments.  First, Tony's.<br>
<p>
He mentioned that all abortion is sin and gives examples of other sins like<br>
pain, death, etc.  One thing to point out.  These are really not sins as much<br>
as they are results of sin.  I don't think I sinning when I am hurting.  A<br>
minor point, perhaps, but one that needs clarification.<br>
<p>
George Tasker mentioned something about the viability of abortion in<br>
preventing possible propagation of "rapists."  Well, in that line of thinking<br>
I am afraid we should all be aborted.  We all carry fouled genetic material.<br>
 The power of sin is transmitted to us from one generation to the next and<br>
makes us all prone to do terrible things.  I am not stating my views on<br>
abortion's rightness or wrongness, just challenging the logic behind why<br>
certain abortions are "good."<br>
<p>
Point three, would be I think that the issue of abortion is really not to be<br>
the focus.  What I mean is prevention needs to be given more emphasis.  We<br>
need a stronger, clearer, consistant message about total abstinance than is<br>
given by the Christian culture.  An emphasis upon the awesome responsibility<br>
we should have over the gift of pro-creation that God has given each one.  It<br>
is not a toy to be played with.<br>
<p>
Sex was not primarily intended for pleasure, as I understand the Scripture.<br>
 It is primarily for "being fruitful and multiplying."  Pleasure and bonding<br>
are by-products if you will.  Such biblical concepts accepted and respected<br>
with go along ways in preventing abortion.  Any comments on this?<br>

How do others of you understand the scriptures in 2 Cor 5:6-9 and Phil 1:23-24<br>
in which the apostle Paul mentions his preference to be "absent from the body"<br>
or to "depart", and thus in both cases to be with the Lord?  I don't believe<br>
the Scripture contradicts itself, therefore I wonder how those words harmonize<br>
with many other scriptures which describe a person's condition in death as<br>
similar to sleep.  To date, I have simply waited for a fuller understanding of<br>
those verses, but recently someone has asked about them and before I respond I<br>
would to hear of any other ideas.<br>
<p>
Reply either directly to me or back onto the SDAnet.<br>
<p>
Thanks for your help.<br>

I agree with this in theory, and in most cases in practice as well.  The<br>
question arises though, how do you deal with people who raise the issue that<br>
if there is a heart beating, there are also lungs that have begun to "breath"<br>
by taking the oxygen from the mother via the placenta/umbilical cord?<br>
(Which is in fact what happens, although the lungs are not developed to the<br>
point of being able to "breath" outside the womb in the real world).<br>

Good post.  Using hypotheticals that have almost no real<br>
application in everyday life is a poor basis for making policies<br>
on something as far reaching as abortion.  There are better<br>
alternatives than killing babies to stop an unwanted pregnancy.<br>

Congradulations!  The Lord has truly blessed you with two<br>
wonderful children, both of whom are a blessing to your and your<br>
wife.  My wife and I are expecting our first child in January,<br>
and when I read of new births like those you wrote of, it<br>
thrills me to my soul.  Your wife has nothing to be sorry for,<br>
and everything to be happy about.  She's just brought into the<br>
world 2 new lives, two babies who will soon be children and then<br>
adults.  My wife and I pray our baby will be healthy, but if for<br>
some reason something has gone wrong, we'll lean on the Lord for<br>
strength, knowing that whatever comes, that baby is a blessing<br>
regardless. The surgery will go fine; tell your wife what a<br>
marvelous thing she and you and the Lord have done, and take<br>
pleasure in your beautiful babies.  God bless you both.<br>
<p>
Joseph <br>

Woody,<br>
<p>
Ignorance is a terrible thing when taken into the public arena<br>
and used to make policies which decide the fate of millions of<br>
unborn people.  Upon what do you base you opinion that the<br>
acquisition of knowledge is the critical criteria for<br>
personhood?  And where have you been hiding that you don't know<br>
that a baby in the womb is indeed acquiring knowledge<br>
appropriate to its stage of development?  My wife's baby is now<br>
coming up on 17 weeks, and that baby can just now hear and<br>
begin recognizing his mother's voice.  Does this not qualify as<br>
the acquisition of knowledge, or do you mean to imply that until<br>
a child can take information through its sensory organs,<br>
assimilate and classify that information in its brain, and then<br>
use selective cognition to further organize that info into<br>
rational thought and decisions it's not a human being?  If so,<br>
you'd better extend the line of demarcation between potential<br>
and actual humanity from birth to 1, 2, or even 4 or 5 years old.<br>
<p>
The argument that a fetus becomes a person when he takes "the<br>
breath of life" is a laugher.  Not only is the Genesis account<br>
unique to Adam and Eve, as they were formed directly by the hand<br>
of God from the dust of the earth, and thus needed life to be<br>
passed to them in a way humans ever since have not, but further<br>
it is God who breaths the breath of life into them, not they who<br>
of their own volition take that first breath.  Using your<br>
literal criteria in applying the Genesis account to all<br>
subsequent births, no one is ever a human being, since God has<br>
never once after Adam and Eve breathed into anyone's nostrils<br>
the breath of life.  All babies take that breath on their own,<br>
and for your information, Woody, they breath much earlier than<br>
their emergence from the birth canal.  They breath oxygen into<br>
their lungs via the amniotic solution they live in while in the<br>
womb.  Pre-born babies breathe every day; my baby is breathing<br>
right now.  Tell me, Woody, if something were to happen to the<br>
baby my wife is carrying right now, would I be amiss to grieve<br>
the loss of a human, or merely a potential human?<br>

Regarding George's "hypothetical" - I have a good friend who, I recently<br>
found out, was conceived via aggravated rape. Once upon a time I used<br>
to agree with George, but... <br>

On a completely different topic, Dave wrote:<br>

No, as a matter of fact if a criminal argued that they were genetically<br>
predisposed to commit crime, then to me that is all the more reason to <br>
lock them away rather than turn them loose.<br>
<p>
This brings up an interesting point, though - the idea of crime and<br>
punishment vs the idea of actions and consequences. "The wages of sin<br>
is death" - is this crime &amp; punishment, or cause &amp; effect? Is there<br>
any difference? Was Jesus' death on the cross a punishment for the<br>
sins of mankind? A consequence? Both, or neither?<br>
<p>
To preempt things a little, I am personally more comfortable with the<br>
picture of God saving humanity from the consequences of their actions,<br>
rather than Him punishing humanity for their depravity.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With some of the theological beliefs about life in Eden changing</i><br>
<i>&gt; after the "fall", I wonder if God created skunks in Eden. And</i><br>
<i>&gt; if there were skunks in Eden, why were they equipped with such</i><br>
<i>&gt; a stink...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Just wondering...were there skunks in Eden?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bill Sands, Jr.</i><br>
<i>&gt; sands@andrews.edu</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; P.S. Will there be skunks in heaven?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Funny you should mention it, Bill.  I once wrote an (unpublished) story<br>
about some skunks on the Ark.  Any opinions that follow are purely<br>
speculative:<br>
<p>
As the fear of Man was not put into animals until after the Flood (Gen<br>
9:2), it's possible that skunks were "pre-equipped" with their trademark<br>
scent but didn't have occasion to use it up to a point.  Though when all<br>
the animals were on the Ark<br>
<p>
*Midrashic storytelling mode on*<br>
<p>
they must have compared notes as to their treatment at the hands of Man.<br>
So they resolved, if they couldn't kill the one placed in a position of<br>
superiority over them by the Creator, that the would have nothing to do<br>
with him and that self-defense was justified.  The skunks must have been<br>
nervous and fearful for their future until they realized their<br>
potential.<br>
<p>
*Midrashic mode off*<br>

Glad you're enjoying the Internet.  Try to get some work done also!  ;-)<br>
I'm sorry that Mr. Stern would manipulate someone in this way.  By state<br>
statute, I cannot reveal to you _who_ has checked out the book, however<br>
I can state that it has not been checked out in the year and a half<br>
we've had the circulation system of JeWeL running.  However, it was checked<br>
out 7 times (twice on interlibrary loan) before that.  Since you have<br>
already revealed that you checked it out, I can also state that you were<br>
the _second_ person to check it out!  Glad you enjoyed JeWeL.  Needless<br>
to say, we do also.<br>

I agree with you wholeheartedly!  Who's to say that retired <br>
professionals, those wanting to stay home and raise a family, or even <br>
someone who's business is up and running "on auto-pilot" wouldn't be <br>
willing to work 1/4- to 1/2-time to do the work that a PASTOR is <br>
expected to do?!  Considering the re-training it would take to teach the <br>
ropes of a multi-million dollar "business" (i.e., the SDA church) to <br>
folks that have gone through schooling for preaching and evangelizing, <br>
etc. <br>
<p>
I think some of the mega $$ boo-boos in the history of our church would <br>
be motivation enough to look for godly men and women *professionals* in our <br>
congregations to fill these positions in the church hierarchy.  And get <br>
some of these preachers back in the field!!!<br>

problem lies--the problem of definition of life.  In Western society we<br>
often fall into the trap of trying to categorize everything--in fact,<br>
much of science is based on this idea.  Even in computing we want the<br>
"switch" to be either on or off.  However, nature is not that simple.<br>
There are many ambiguities, and this is certainly one of them.  Both the<br>
beginning and end of life are processes rather than a precise point in<br>
time.  Even if one accepts a definition that life begins when a fetus is<br>
viable outside the womb, this would imply that the definition of life<br>
depends on the ability of scientific medicine to keep moving that date<br>
back earlier.<br>
<p>
Steve, I don't see any biblical or moral imperative to protect<br>
"potential life."  Removing the potential for life is not the same as<br>
murder.  After all, there's potential for life even before the sperm and<br>
the ovum unite.  I remain pro-choice.<br>
<p>
So far (as so often in this debate) I believe only males have discussed<br>
this.  I would like to hear more of a female perspective, as it is often<br>
quite different on this topic.  I found the cover article in _Time_ this<br>
week on genes and infidelity to be quite fascinating.  Is it possible<br>
that we males have a different perspective because we are concerned<br>
(probably unconsciously) that _our_ offspring might be threatened?  Just<br>
a thought.<br>
<p>
I appreciate the fact that so far this discussion has been happening<br>
without flames.  I hope we can keep it that way.<br>

My grandfather died suddenly and unexpectedly last Sabbath morning.  I<br>
left town in such a hurry that I didn't suspend my mail on any of my<br>
discussion lists - I had over 200 postings this AM :( --didn't even<br>
thinkof dealing with any of it while I was out of town.<br>
<p>
I gave the invocation at the funeral and thought I'd share it with you<br>
as I note several letters reporting losses during the past week or so.<br>
In fact, while I was in Collegedale I saw the news reports about<br>
Olivia's death, and saw her parents reacting with dignity.  Recognized<br>
her father as a former acquaintance of mine.  My sympathy to Pam Harris<br>
and the Maizes.<br>
<p>
Lord,<br>
Remember your word to us, your servants, for you have given us hope.<br>
(deleted)<br>
May your unfailing love be our comfort.<br>
Let your compassion come to us that we may live.<br>
Amen<br>
<p>
I have found these verses (paraphrased) and others like them in<br>
Psalm 119 to be very comforting in the past week.<br>

When the sperm unites with the ovum, does life begin then?<br>
If not, is the fetus dead at that stage, such that its not<br>
alive? If so then when does it begin to live? at how many<br>
minutes, hours, days, weeks, or is it uniquely after its<br>
born?<br>

In-Reply-&gt;To: &lt;38@reason.win.net&gt; from "Joseph Miceli" at Aug 13, 94 11:52:09 am<br>
<p>
I consider myself very fortunate that out of the life threatening <br>
circumsances that we experience that I have two lovely boys that I am so <br>
proud of.  My referral to abortion etc. was the result of my mind wandering <br>
off into the weirdest of places which it is prone to do when reading as I am <br>
typing.<br>
<p>
A memory has been jogged as the result of reading other people's thoughts on <br>
the topic.  I remember coming across a girl who told me how she fell <br>
pregnant to a boyfriend and her thinking was that she would be punishing the <br>
child which she had simply on account of their actions and to her it did not <br>
seem fair that this unborn should be punished for what they had chosen to <br>
do.<br>
<p>
I think that there is a lot of merit in that thought.  It seems that as a <br>
general society is punishing the innocent unborn, sentencing them to death <br>
for things of which they themselves are guilty.  Is this what we mean by <br>
human sacrifice?<br>

<i>&gt;story, that abortion will provide a solution to the problem, women</i><br>
<i>&gt;often consent to pressure from the man, only to find that they</i><br>
<i>&gt;suffer from post-abortion syndrom, which manifests itself in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;variety of ways.  Depression and anger are common, and a deep</i><br>
<i>&gt;seated sense of guilt sometimes torments the woman for years,</i><br>
<i>&gt;especially when she later carries a wanted baby to term.  </i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't like to see forgotten the men who refused women abortions<br>
when perhaps they should have been done.<br>
Wasn't there an Irish case (exceptional of course) not too long ago where<br>
a rape victim was not allowed an abortion in Ireland and (for a while)<br>
was not allowed to leave the country to get one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;protected, then do so.  But need we continue the abortion on</i><br>
<i>&gt;demand industry so that men and women can pursue a reckless and</i><br>
<i>&gt;valueless lifestyle at the expense of innocent children?</i><br>
<p>
I feel the industry must be maintained.<br>
<p>
Its all the big sin problem. I'd rather see children not be given the<br>
chance to live than to grow up unwanted. So many of our societal problems<br>
stem from children being abused or ignored by their parents.<br>
<p>
When the children that are born are all loved, then I'll start picketing the<br>
abortion clinics.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, I do rather value my own life!<br>

Bill,	Can you tell me since when does equal rights = special treatment? <br>
Do you also still believe that the womans place is in the kitchen and <br>
not in voter registration lines? Should we bring slavery back to life? <br>
As long as we have oppression we have the upper hand in matters.... <br>
unless we belong to the group being oppressed!<br>
<p>
Don't judge until you have walked in their shoes for a day. Have you <br>
ever read the book "Black Like Me"?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Once it has been shown that you have been justified by Christ,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there is no need to keep you on probation. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Once justified, then no more on probation?!  Sounds like "once saved, always</i><br>
<i>&gt; saved".  Sounds like "evangelical Adventism".  I submit that the parable</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Mat 18:23-35 teaches us that probation continues even after forgiveness,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that our sins can come back upon our heads and we can lose that justification.</i><br>
<i>&gt; BTW, our sins are not blotted out (Acts 3:19; cf Jer 17:1) until the times</i><br>
<i>&gt; of refreshing, which occur at the end of the anti-typical Day of Atonement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- </i><br>
<p>
Though Smuts van Rooyen was and is one of the leading proponents of <br>
evangelical Adventism, I did not do his sermon justice with the above <br>
reconstruction of a sermon that I heard in 1977 or thereabouts...<br>
He did not specifically tie "no further claims" to justification in that<br>
sermon.  But he did say that there is a time, before the 2nd Advent,<br>
that corresponds to the close of probation, where it will be clear that <br>
people are safe to save (and again I am paraphrasing his words.)<br>
<p>
I have heard the idea that your sins come back on you if you fall or something,<br>
but I don't believe it and don't think it can be classified as SDA theology.<br>
Can God cast our sins so deep into the sea that He can't retrieve them?<br>
I think so.  Rather, any falling away is a new sin with corresponding new <br>
penalty, but what is forgiven is forgotten.<br>

=============================TEKSTIN ALKU==========================<br>
Neurolinquistic programming (NLP) is said to be a new language in <br>
psychology, but is difficult to give an exact definition for it. It has not <br>
grown from some guru or around a theory. It is more like a plant that has <br>
roots in diverse areas and sciences and on it is continuously growing new <br>
leaves.<br>
<p>
Anyhow there are some basic presumptions which clarify the ideas behind <br>
NLP. Eg. the terrain is the same for everybody, but one is making his own <br>
map of it, depending on his genes and on experiences. When we understand <br>
this, we can also understand why people are not always ready to accept our <br>
truth. They have a different map of the terrain.<br>
<p>
NLP is helping us in communication with each other. We can see that their <br>
concept is a visual one (they see things clearly), or if it sounds OK <br>
(auditive) or if they have a burden about something (kinestetic). We will <br>
see their feelings in their fysiology (body language). <br>
<p>
In everyday life we are using the language patterns of NLP, knowingly or <br>
unknowingly. We might say to a person: "If you get well, then you can..." <br>
or "when you get well, then you can.." By choosing our wording we can <br>
create a positive or doubting effect. Of course, you might think this is to <br>
control the mind!<br>
<p>
In therapy one has created neurolinquistic programming by modelling  top <br>
specialists or therapeutists - looking closely how they are "functioning", <br>
how they are talking. By using their techniques (linquistic programs) we <br>
get access to their skills.<br>
<p>
You can use NLP in planning your future or when confronting frightening <br>
things from the past. Of course you could use just prayer to meet the <br>
future or the past. But maybe our prayers would be more effective, when we <br>
know ourselves better. NLP is a good *tool* to find out about us and <br>
others.<br>
<p>
There are many other leaves in the tree of NLP, it has been written lots of <br>
books anout it during the last 20 years. I like to see NLP as fishing, you <br>
need not eat all the fish you get, you just choose the best ones. NLP a <br>
devils tool? - sure - the devil is using the Bible very cleverly, too, when <br>
it suits his plans.<br>
<p>
BTW it would be interesting to know if somebody has used NLP in for <br>
instance stop-smoking seminars and weight control programs.<br>

 From Bill Sands, Jr.<br>
<p>
The wording which I used to introduce the APA statement about<br>
Lesbians/Gays/Bisexuals was unfortunate. I meant to convey<br>
that I was encouraged by this resolution because these groups,<br>
who are discriminated against, are correct in their self-defense.<br>
<p>
I apologize for the original wording of my intro.<br>

<p>
Counsel Regarding the Question of the 144,000<br>
<p>
(See The Great Controversy, pp. 648, 649 for Ellen WhiteUs basic statement)<br>
<p>
A Non-Essential Question<br>
<p>
"Christ says that there will be those in the church who will present fables and<br>
suppositions, when God has given grand, elevating, ennobling truth, which should<br>
ever be kept in the treasure-house of the mind.  When men pick up this theory<br>
and that theory, when they are curious to know something it is not necessary for<br>
them to know, God is not leading them.  It is not His plan that His people shall<br>
present something which they have to suppose, which is not taught in the Word.<br>
It is not His will that they shall get into controversy over questions which<br>
will not help them spiritually, such as who is to compose the hundred and<br>
forty-four thousand.  This those who are the elect of God will in a short time<br>
know without question.<br>
<p>
"My brethren and sisters, appreciate and study the truths God has given for you<br>
and your children.  Spend not your time in seeking to know that which will be no<br>
spiritual help.  'What shall I do to inherit eternal life?'  This is the<br>
all-important question, and it has been clearly answered.  'What is written in<br>
the law?  How readest thou?'"--Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 174, 175.<br>
<p>
Strive to Be Among the 144,000<br>
<p>
"Let us strive with all the power that God has given us to be among the hundred<br>
and forty-four thousand.  And let us do all that we can to help others to gain<br>
heaven."--Review and Herald, March 9, 1905.<br>
<p>
Mrs. White and the 144,000<br>
<p>
"The Lord has given me a view of other worlds.  Wings were given me, and an<br>
angel attended me from the city to a place that was bright and glorious.  The<br>
grass of the place was living green, and the birds there warbled a sweet song.<br>
The inhabitants of the place were of all sizes; they were noble, majestic, and<br>
lovely.  They bore the express image of Jesus, and their countenances beamed<br>
with holy joy, expressive of the freedom and happiness of the place. . . . I<br>
begged of my attending angel to let me remain in that place.  I could not bear<br>
the thought of coming back to this dark world again.  Then the angel said, 'You<br>
must go back, and if you are faithful, you, with* the 144,000, shall have the<br>
privilege of visiting all the worlds and viewing the handiwork of God.'"--Early<br>
Writings, pp. 39, 40.<br>
<p>
*Note:  Observe that the promise was given to Mrs. White that if she was<br>
faithful, she with the 144,000 would have certain privileges.<br>
<p>
Mrs. Hastings to Be With the 144,000<br>
<p>
"I saw that she [Mrs. Hastings, who had just died] was sealed and would come up<br>
at the voice of God and stand upon the earth, and would be with the 144,000.  I<br>
saw we need not mourn for her; she would rest in the time of trouble."--Letter<br>
10, 1850 (2SM 263).<br>
<p>
Silence is Eloquence<br>
<p>
[The following letter from C. C. Crisler, leading secretary in Mrs. White's<br>
office, addressed to Elder E. E. Andross, president of the Pacific Union<br>
Conference, was called forth by a request from him to Sister White for any light<br>
she might have bearing on the teachings of Dr. B. E. Fullmer of Los Angeles,<br>
that the 144,000 will be made up of Americans only, none from other lands.]<br>
<p>
"Elmshaven, Sanitarium, California<br>
<p>
December 8, 1914<br>
<p>
Elder E. E. Andross<br>
Box 146<br>
Glendale, California<br>
<p>
Dear Brother Andross:<br>
<p>
During the few minutes remaining of the noon hour before close of mails, after<br>
receiving your special delivery letter of inquiry, I sent you a hurried reply to<br>
your communication, promising further word by wire.  Tonight I am sending [you]<br>
the following telegraphic letter:<br>
<p>
"'Mrs. White instructs me to inform you she has no light further than that the<br>
presentation of uncertainties as certainties, and the urging of mysteries as<br>
revealed truths, is perilous and leads to disappointment.  She suggests building<br>
on Holy Scriptures, the true foundation, rather than on personal conjecture.--C.<br>
C. Crisler.'<br>
<p>
"When reading the letter to Sister White, and listening to her remarks in<br>
response, I had with me as a witness Elder D. E. Robinson.<br>
<p>
"'I have no light on the subject,' she said, upon hearing the letter.  'It is a<br>
very delicate time in which we are living--a time when we must individually<br>
cling tot he Lord with all the powers of our being.' She said further:<br>
<p>
"'Those who urge theories regarding matters that are not revealed, are placing<br>
themselves where they are in peril of meeting with disappointments.  "Hide<br>
yourself in God; hide your mysteries in God"--these words have been repeated<br>
during the night season, over and over again.  From the fist, I have been<br>
instructed that the Lord Jesus can give counsel that will not bring<br>
disappointment.<br>
<p>
"'Please tell my brethren that I have nothing presented before me regarding the<br>
circumstances concerning which they write, and I can set before them only that<br>
which has been presented to me.<br>
<p>
"'There are those who attempt to deal with uncertainties as certainties; and<br>
when they reach this position, they are where it is possible for the enemy to<br>
use them.<br>
<p>
"'In the past, light has been given me repeatedly that when a crisis arises, we<br>
are to take the counsel of God, and trace interestedly every item that presents<br>
the truth in its verity.<br>
<p>
"'The greatest help will come when we see the influence of the teachings of the<br>
Holy Scriptures. Their influence is to lead us to stand on an exalted basis,<br>
where we will build our faith and the faith of others, not on this one's say-so,<br>
and that one's say-so, and another one's say-so, but on the real foundation, the<br>
Word of the living God.'<br>
<p>
"I have tried to write out from my notes the words spoken by Sister White after<br>
listening to your letter and to portions of the letter written by me, also to my<br>
hastily written reply to you.  by no word or sign did Sister White attempt to<br>
say which party is right and which party is wrong.  In no wise did she make any<br>
comment on my letter you, and, so far as we could understand, in no wise did she<br>
attempt to interpret or explain that which she has written in former years<br>
regarding the 144,000.  But, rising above mere detail, she outlined the<br>
principles set forth above.<br>
<p>
"I have nothing to add to that which I wrote at noon.  Yes, there is one comment<br>
Sister White did make when I was reading to her my letter.  She expressed<br>
pleasure over the fact that I had included in my letter to you the words, 'On<br>
the matter of the exact meaning of the 144,000 Sister White was repeatedly<br>
instructed us that "silence is eloquence."'<br>
<p>
"She also commented favorably upon hearing the words with which I closed 'So far<br>
as I now know, no one knows the full truth of the matter, nor will we know until<br>
we are on the other side of Jordan.'<br>
<p>
"I feel confident, Elder Andross, that the brethren in Southern California will<br>
find blessing in reviewing the teachings of Scripture concerning the 144,000,<br>
and bringing to bear upon these teachings whatever light there may be int he<br>
published writings of Sister White.  And as prayerful consideration is given the<br>
matter in all its bearings, I believe that God will make the truth sufficiently<br>
clear to make possible the avoidance of needless and unprofitable controversy<br>
over questions not vital to the salvation of precious souls.<br>
<p>
"With kindest regards, and praying that God may given breadth of sympathy was<br>
well as clarity of vision to those called upon to handle this perplexing problem<br>
that has arisen, I am as ever,<br>
<p>
"Yours truly,<br>
<p>
C. C. Crisler"<br>

SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST GUIDELINES ON ABORTION<br>
<p>
	VOTED,  To approve Seventh-day Adventist Guidelines on Abortion as follows:<br>
<p>
Seventh-day Adventist Guidelines on Abortion <br>
<p>
	Many contemporary societies have faced conflict over the morality of abortion.1<br>
Such conflict also has affected large numbers within Christianity who want to<br>
accept responsibility for the protection of prenatal human life while also<br>
preserving the personal liberty of women. The need for guidelines has become<br>
evident, as the Church attempts to follow scripture, and to provide moral<br>
guidance while respecting individual conscience.  Seventh-day Adventists want to<br>
relate to the question of abortion in ways that reveal faith in God as the<br>
tainer of all life and in ways that reflect Christian<br>
ity and freedom.  Though honest differences on the question of<br>
abortion exist among Seventh-day Adventists, the following represents an attempt<br>
to provide guidelines on a number of principles and issues. The guidelines are<br>
based on broad biblical principles that are presented for study at the end of<br>
the document.2<br>
<p>
	1.	Prenatal human life is a magnificent gift of God.  God's ideal for human<br>
beings affirms the sanctity of human life, in God's image, and requires respect<br>
for prenatal life.  However, decisions about life must be made in the context of<br>
a fallen world.  Abortion is never an action of little moral consequence.  Thus<br>
prenatal life must not be thoughtlessly destroyed.  Abortion should be performed<br>
only for the most serious reasons.<br>
<p>
	2.	Abortion is one of the tragic dilemmas of human fallenness.  The Church<br>
should offer gracious support to those who personally face the decision<br>
concerning an abortion.  Attitudes of condemnation are inappropriate in those<br>
who have accepted the gospel. Christians are commissioned to become a loving,<br>
caring community of faith that assists those in crisis as alternatives are<br>
considered.<br>
<p>
	3.	In practical, tangible ways the Church as a supportive community should<br>
express its commitment to the value of human life.  These ways should include:<br>
<p>
(a) strengthening family relationships, (b) educating both genders concerning<br>
Christian principles of human sexuality, (c) emphasizing responsibility of both<br>
male and female for family planning, (d) calling both to be responsible for the<br>
consequences of behaviors that are inconsistent with Christian principles, (e)<br>
creating a safe climate for ongoing discussion of the moral questions associated<br>
with abortion, (f) offering support and assistance to women who choose to<br>
complete crisis pregnancies, and (g) encouraging and assisting fathers to<br>
participate responsibly in the parenting of their children.  The Church also<br>
should commit itself to assist in alleviating the unfortunate social, economic,<br>
and psychological factors that may lead to<br>
abortion and to care redemptively for those suffering the coces of<br>
individual decisions on this issue.<br>
<p>
	4.	The Church does not serve as conscience for individuals; however, it should<br>
provide moral guidance.  Abortions for reasons of birth control, gender<br>
selection, or convenience are not condoned by the Church.  Women, at times<br>
however, may face exceptional circumstances that present serious moral or<br>
medical dilemmas, such as significant threats to the pregnant woman's life,<br>
serious jeopardy to her health, severe congenital defects carefully diagnosed in<br>
the fetus, and pregnancy resulting from rape or incest.  The final decision<br>
whether to terminate the pregnancy or not should be made by the pregnant woman<br>
after appropriate consultation.  She should be aided in her decision by accurate<br>
information, biblical principles, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<br>
Moreover, these decisions are best made within the context of healthy family<br>
relationships.  <br>
<p>
	5.	Christians acknowledge as first and foremost their accountability to God.<br>
They seek balance between the exercise of individual liberty and their<br>
accountability to the faith community and the larger society and its laws.  They<br>
make their choices according to scripture and the laws of God rather than the<br>
norms of society.  Therefore, any attempts to coerce women either to remain<br>
pregnant or to terminate pregnancy should be rejected as infringements of<br>
personal freedom.<br>
<p>
	6.	Church institutions should be provided with guidelines for developing their<br>
own institutional policies in harmony with this statement.  Persons having a<br>
religious or ethical objection to abortion should not be required to participate<br>
in the performance of abortions.<br>
<p>
	7.	Church members should be encouraged to participate in the ongoing<br>
consideration of their moral responsibilities with regard to abortion in light<br>
of the teaching of scripture.<br>
<p>
_______________<br>
<p>
	1Abortion, as understood in these guidelines, is defined as any action aimed at<br>
the termination of a pregnancy already established.  This is distinguished from<br>
contraception, which is intended to prevent a pregnancy.  The focus of the<br>
document is on abortion.<br>
<p>
	2The fundamental perspective of these guidelines is taken from a broad study of<br>
scripture as shown in the following ``Principles for a Christian View of Human<br>
Life:''<br>
<p>
Introduction<br>
<p>
	``Now this is eternal life; that they may know you, the only true God, and<br>
Jesus Christ whom you have sent'' (John 17:3, NIV).  In Christ is the promise of<br>
eternal life; but since human life is mortal, humans are confronted with<br>
difficult issues regarding life and death.  The following principles refer to<br>
the whole person (body, soul, and spirit), an indivisible whole (Genesis 2:7; 1<br>
Thessalonians 5:23).<br>
Life:  Our valuable gift from God<br>
<p>
	 1.	God is the Source, Giver, and Sustainer of all life (Acts 17:25,28; <br>
Job 33:4; Genesis 1:30, 2:7; Psalm 36:9; John 1:3,4).<br>
<p>
	 2.	Human life has unique value because human beings, though fallen, are<br>
created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27; Romans 3:23; 1 John 2:2; 1 John 3:2;<br>
John 1:29; <br>
1 Peter 1:18,19).<br>
<p>
	 3.	God values human life not on the basis of human accomplishments or<br>
contributions but because we are God's creation and the object of His redeeming<br>
love <br>
(Romans 5:6,8; Ephesians 2:2-6; 1 Timothy 1:15; Titus 3:4,5; Matthew 5:43-48;<br>
<p>
Ephesians 2:4-9; John 1:3, 10:10).<br>
<p>
Life:  Our response to God's gift<br>
<p>
	 4.	Valuable as it is, human life is not the only or ultimate concern.<br>
Self-sacrifice in devotion to God and His principles may take precedence over<br>
life itself <br>
(Revelation 12:11; 1 Corinthians 13).<br>
<p>
	 5.	God calls for the protection of human life and holds humanity accountable<br>
for its destruction (Exodus 20:13; Revelation 21:8; Exodus 23:7; Deuteronomy<br>
24:16; <br>
Proverbs 6:16,17; Jeremiah 7:3-34; Micah 6:7; Genesis 9:5,6).<br>
<p>
	 6.	God is especially concerned for the protection of the weak, the<br>
defenseless, and the oppressed (Psalm 82:3,4; James 1:27; Micah 6:8; Acts 20:35;<br>
<p>
Proverbs 24:11,12; Luke 1:52-54).<br>
<p>
	 7.	Christian love (agape) is the costly dedication of our lives to enhancing<br>
the lives of others.  Love also respects personal dignity and does not condone<br>
the oppression of one person to support the abusive behavior of another (Matthew<br>
16:21; Philippians 2:1-11; 1 John 3:16; 1 John 4:8-11; Matthew 22:39; John<br>
18:22,23; John 13:34).<br>
<p>
	 8.	The believing community is called to demonstrate Christian love in<br>
tangible, practical, and substantive ways.  God calls us to restore gently the<br>
broken (Galatians 6:1,2; 1 John 3:17,18; Matthew 1:23; Philippians 2:1-11; John<br>
8:2-11; <br>
Romans 8:1-14; Matthew 7:1,2, 12:20; Isaiah 40:42, 62:2-4).<br>
<p>
Life:  Our right and responsibility to decide<br>
<p>
	 9.	God gives humanity the freedom of choice, even if it leads to abuse and<br>
tragic consequences.  His unwillingness to coerce human obedience necessitated<br>
the sacrifice of His Son.  He requires us to use His gifts in accordance with<br>
His will and ultimately will judge their misuse (Deuteronomy 30:19,20; Genesis<br>
3; 1 Peter 2:24; <br>
Romans 3:5,6, 6:1,2; Galatians 5:13).<br>
<p>
	10.	God calls each of us individually to moral decision making and to search<br>
the scriptures for the biblical principles underlying such choices (John 5:39;<br>
Acts 17:11; <br>
1 Peter 2:9; Romans 7:13-25).<br>
	11.	Decisions about human life from its beginning to its end are best made<br>
within the context of healthy family relationships with the support of the faith<br>
community <br>
(Exodus 20:12; Ephesians 5,6).<br>
2.	Human decisions should always be centered in seeking the will of God<br>
<p>
(Romans 12:2; Ephesians 6:6; Luke 22:42).<br>

On Sunday August 14, 1994 I posted a response to GC president remarks on<br>
Church unity and diversity he made at the recent televised ASI<br>
convention.  <br>
<p>
I want to continue with a WARNING ABOUT UNITY.  <br>
<p>
The problem is that when the subject comes us about blakc and white<br>
churches the idea is that the black conferences or church will disband.<br>
If this is the concept that we will be going backwards. I believe that<br>
all unions and conferences would need to be re-organized.  Away will<br>
this seperation.   <br>
<p>
I am not supporting "membership bussing."  I am support open<br>
administration to all colors and ethnic groups.  Stop placing people<br>
with boxes.   <br>
<p>
Do you know that some "black leaders" and saying that the NAACP is no<br>
longer relevant.  I also believe that Regional Conference are not longer<br>
relevant.  The are doing more harm than good.   A real reason why many<br>
refuse to touch this problem even with a ten foot pole is because is a<br>
all about POWER and position.<br>
<p>
I challendge the first Black or White pastor who would take the bull by<br>
the horn.  Do for it.<br>
<p>
That is GO FOR IT!!..<br>
<p>
I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IF SOMETHING DOES NOT HAPPEN SOON TO CHANGE THE<br>
FACE OF OUR CHURCH, WE WILL PUBLICALLY EMBARRASED AGAIN.  And this time<br>
more terriably.<br>
<p>
Let's get going.  IF WE CAN'T LIVE AND WORSHIP TOGETHER ON EARTH, we<br>
will not be able to do it in heaven, in fact we will not get there.<br>
<p>

<i>    &gt; a pre-born has no way of aquireing any knowlege, therefore is &lt;</i><br>
<i>    &gt; not a human being ...  If a feotus is non-viable, then I have &lt;</i><br>
<i>    &gt; absolutly no problem with aborting it.                        &lt;</i><br>
<p>
    The topic of abortion is serious--  much more so, in my opinion, than <br>
    most of the doctrinal issues that are argued about in this SDAnet.  As<br>
    I have studied the issue (and changed my position in the last several<br>
    years), I have observed that the most frequent arguments in favor of<br>
    "abortion-on-demand" refer to the negative effects of an unplanned <br>
    and/or unwanted pregnancy on someone's career, standard of living, <br>
    embarassment, difficulty, and etc.  Usually there is also the concern<br>
    expressed for the poor "quality of life" that an unwanted, disadvantaged <br>
    child will surely experience.  The most frequent arguments against<br>
    "abortion-on-demand" refer to the principles of the sacredness of life,<br>
    of concern for the weakest ones among us, and of responsibility for the<br>
    consequences of our actions.<br>
<p>
    I have decided that the principles used to oppose abortion are much more<br>
    noble and worthy of support than those in favor of abortion.  Life must<br>
    be considered as sacred, and not to be casually disposed of for the sake<br>
    of convenience.  Careers, living standards, prestige, and even "quality<br>
    of life" are matters of convenience.  Others in this world survive amid<br>
    situations that are worse than anything a disadvantaged or unwanted child<br>
    will experience in this country.<br>
<p>
    The statements quoted at the beginning of this message are typical of<br>
    careless and arbitrary rationalization, and do not reflect serious <br>
    thinking about this life and death issue.  The statement that a "pre-<br>
    born" shouldn't be considered as human because it cannot acquire <br>
    knowledge has been very well answered by another.  I would like to <br>
    respond to the statement about viability.<br>
<p>
    When is a fetus viable?  Today's limit of viability, before which some<br>
    believe that abortions are of no consequence, is tomorrow's successful<br>
    innovation when physicians manage to save one more baby that struggled<br>
    into the world a bit too early.  In the hospital where I work, there are<br>
    "pre-borns" that are newborns.  They struggle to stay alive in our neo-<br>
    natal intensive care unit.  Many of them are smaller than a lot of aborted<br>
    babies, so small that their skin has not even fully formed.  Many of <br>
    them survive and the bulletin boards in the hallway are filled with <br>
    their photographs years later.<br>
<p>
    Twenty five years ago none of these babies would have been "viable".<br>
    Is it really credible that a moral judgement, such as whether it is<br>
    wrong to kill a growing fetus, is dependent on the level of health<br>
    care technology?  We spend millions of dollars to save babies that<br>
    often are worse off than those who are aborted.  Sometimes the ones we<br>
    save are the ones who SURVIVE abortion attempts.  Why do we go to such<br>
    expense and effort, if not because these babies are human beings?<br>
<p>
    The parallels between the Holocaust, in which Jews and others were<br>
    progressively labelled as less than fully human, and today's abortion<br>
    industry are frightening.  Life must be considered as sacred, or else<br>
    your own life is in danger.<br>
<p>
    That's not all that could be said, but it's time to stop.<br>
<p>
    May God help us to defend those most helpless among us.<br>

I know I'm bailing out during a fascinating, and heated, discussion<br>
on a "taboo" topic. I now see why.<br>
<p>
Take care, everyone. Keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I endure<br>
the 18-hour journey from Chicago to Manila. If I still have any stomach<br>
left when I return, I just might tell you about it.<br>

What would the Operation Rescue activists do if someone were to attend one<br>
of their protests and start saying "PREVENT abortions!" quietly and hand<br>
out condoms and spermacide to everyone in sight?<br>
<p>
There is often far too little wisdom in debates on abortion, so it is truly<br>
miraculous that the corporate church was able to develop such a wise policy<br>
on abortion.<br>
<p>
Abortion is a terrible means of birth control. Aging self-righteous _men_<br>
and bureaucrats have no business dictating to the individual woman what she<br>
is going to do with her body. As a man, I would not mind at all if men were<br>
not even allowed to discuss abortion, let alone make laws regarding it.<br>

In-Reply-&gt;To: &lt;Pine.3.05.9408141648.A24242-9100000@ecf.puc.edu&gt; from "Dan Crowe" at Aug 14, 94 04:41:20 pm<br>
<p>
It was once suggested to me that:-<br>
    thanksgiving - involves what God has done<br>
    praise       - involves who God is (His character, e.g., Exo 34:6,7)<br>
<p>
I found the distinction interesting; unfortunately, I haven't yet come across<br>
support for making this distinction.  Can anyone help on this?<br>

Bill, the blood carries oxegen.  Believe it or not, there are now<br>
synthetic blood subsitutes.  They don't carry the defenses that blood does,<br>
but they will transport oxegen, and can be used to replace blood for<br>
that purpose.  Life is in the Blood, only in the sense that the blood<br>
provides nutrients, and gasses to the cells, and removes waste products.<br>
You can have all the blood circulating in your body that you need, but<br>
if you aren't oxegenation it, and removing CO2, i.e. breathing, you<br>
are going to be dead very shortly.  The cells will starve for oxegen.<br>
I think the way the bible puts it, is once again a cultural artifact<br>
in this sense:  Back then science was an empirical thing.  You let the<br>
blood out of an animal, and it dies.  Therefore the life is in the blood.<br>
I think that the Lord had to put it that way, so the people could<br>
understand.  Consider what this would mean to the bible folk,<br>
"You shall not eat the blood of the animal, because the blood supplies<br>
oxegen to the cells, the blood removes waste products, and is processed<br>
by the liver."<br>
None of these things were known at that time.<br>
Cheers<br>

Maybe this in an example of the Bible text that states that the sins (or the<br>
effects of the sins) of the parents will be passed on to the children until the<br>
3rd and 4th generations (highly paraphrased here).  I think there are many<br>
examples where sins of the parents affect the children through inherited<br>
traits. The alchoholic addition is one that comes to mind.  Drug use is likely<br>
another.<br>
<p>
Just a thought...<br>

Thanks, Harvey.  I don't quite know how I became the second person to<br>
check it out, as it was special ordered for me, but it does not matter.<br>
I am glad that it got checked out more than that, and am glad to<br>
see that it went out on interlibrary loan.  Should the library ever<br>
decide to retire or remove the book, I would like to have it.<br>
<p>
I think what Aaron Stern did was wonderful.  The ultimate programming<br>
enviornment.  Actually he did very little manipulating, mostly he made<br>
sure that his daughter had a very enriched enviornment.  She was reading<br>
street signs at 3.  He was actually rather shocked when she did that.<br>
<p>
He played classical music at low volume in her nursery, essentially 24<br>
hours a day.  When she was just a few months old, she had already selected<br>
favorite pieces, and would smile when they came on, but frown and cry<br>
when one she did not like was played.  There are many more interesting<br>
tidbits in this book.<br>
<p>
Cheers<br>

Just wondering...were there skunks in Eden?<br>
<p>
The following is my own theory; it has no Biblical basis<br>
or reasoning:  Is it possible that skunks were equipped with<br>
the ability to spray that awful scent AFTER the fall,<br>
because the skunk would need some way to repel<br>
larger carnivores that might be inclined to eat them?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;P.S. Will there be skunks in heaven?</i><br>
<p>
I'm wondering if there will be animals in the new heaven,<br>
or will they only be inhabiting the new earth?  Whether<br>
skunks will be present in the new heaven or new earth,<br>
they certainly won't have any reason to be frightened,<br>
so I would think that they wouldn't have any reason to<br>
spray.  Or maybe, since God will make all things new,<br>
the skunk will have a new scent.  ;-)<br>

<i>&gt;Amy:</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Seems that you are great advicing pastors. Could you help me with</i><br>
<i>&gt;this one. I am going to a new district this weekend. Seems that there</i><br>
<i>&gt;have been problems that I do not understand well yet and neither have</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough information of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Churcha and the place have a wonderful potential. I am relatively new in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ministry and coming new to a church is always a difficult thing to do.</i><br>
<i>&gt;	As a church memeber, what would you expect from your new pastor?</i><br>
<i>&gt;What things would you like him not to do? How and how fast changes most</i><br>
<i>&gt;be brought?</i><br>
Sorry it has taken me so long to answer - my grandfather died and I was<br>
out of town all last week.  Off the top of my head:<br>
Transitions occur in stages - predictable phases which are experienced<br>
in different intensities and length of time by different people.<br>
<p>
1. Honeymoon phase :)  in which the transitioner is fascinated by the<br>
new place/role, feels eager to explore and make new friends, views life<br>
and the surroundings/people positively, and generally feels high<br>
energy.Toward the end of this stage however new thoughts/feelings creep<br>
in and the person/group says to self "I/we don't know who I/we am<br>
anymore".  "a mistake was made with this choice - must be the wrong<br>
choice."<br>
<p>
2.Hostility phase :(  in which the transitioners feel hostile toward the<br>
environment/other people, may act agressively, actively finds<br>
faults/shortcomings, criticizes, remembers/talks about how much better<br>
the former place/friends/environment was, feels and may talk about not<br>
really fitting inthis new place, etc.  This phase includes generalized,<br>
negative statements like "this church/school/whatever doesn't really<br>
care about its preacher/teacher/whatever". "Tennesseans are rude" etc.<br>
This is the phase where most people change jobs, bail out of marriage,<br>
call the conference, etc., drop out of school.<br>
<p>
3.  Humor phase  - if transitioners hang on during #2, they eventually<br>
begin to see some humor in their adjustment, begin to see some<br>
misunderstandings they had about the new environment/people, etc, find<br>
they can laugh at their mistakes, don't blame others for their problems.<br>
They are much more in tune with the social cues in the new environment<br>
and find they can have what feels like friendly contact rather than just<br>
business-like contact.<br>
<p>
4. At home - in which the new environment is accepted, new customs<br>
embraced, accepts new expectations, enjoys the differences from the<br>
past, and knows how to get along.  Feels secure and at-home, and if left<br>
this place would now miss it and feel a little homesick or lonesome for<br>
it.<br>
<p>
I would like my new minister to be aware of these phases that he will<br>
experience and to recognize that the corporate body will experience the<br>
same phases.  I would like  him to go gently...adjustment is a process<br>
that takes time and usually can't be hurried.  I appreciate ministers<br>
who invite suggestions, group involvement, make suggestions rather than<br>
commands, and ingeneral show respect for the decision-making ability of<br>
the church which functioned before he got there and will have to live<br>
with the decisions and changes after he's gone.<br>
<p>
"What we call the beginning is often the end.  And to make an end is to<br>
make a beginning.  The end is where we start from." T.S. Elliot<br>
<p>
Dennis, if you want more specific answers, just ask and I'll try to<br>
answer more specifically :)  I wish you the very best,  amy<br>

While we're on with the "hypotheticals" here's another one for<br>
you all to ponder.<br>
<p>
Adventist girl and adventist boy in long-standing relationship<br>
have a nasty breakup. Later, girl meets another boy, they become<br>
friends, they date, and then become engaged. A few months before<br>
the wedding date, girl is visited by ex-boyfriend at night. <br>
After a confrontation she is raped by ex-boyfriend, and <br>
consequently falls pregnant. There is no question over the<br>
identity of the father, as this has been the only opportunity<br>
for conception. Ex-boyfriend, upon finding out that girl is<br>
pregnant, makes it clear that he will expect to have a part<br>
in the upbringing of the child.<br>
<p>
It's ridiculous using such hypotheticals as this in these <br>
discussions, isn't it. All I can say is, if hypothetically<br>
you happen to find yourself praying one of these days, perhaps<br>
you could spare a thought for this hypothetical girl and her<br>
fiance - pray that they can now live with whatever hypothetical<br>
decision they may have made in this case.<br>
<p>
	Tony<br>
<p>
ps... Yes I agree that "policy" shouldn't be based on individual<br>
instances. But let's not forget that life is just a whole lot<br>
of individual instances!<br>

<p>
Much discussion has been going on regarding whether abortion is right or<br>
wrong and when life begins, but it seems to me the most important issue<br>
of the big abortion question in this country is the issue of choice.  I<br>
do not believe that abortions are a good thing.  I don't see how any<br>
Christian can support abortions (there are always exceptions and<br>
hypothetical situations that can be raised, of course).  However, I am <br>
pro-choice.  I belive that a woman should have the right to choose to<br>
have an abortion.  I don't think the government should be able to<br>
regulate such a personal decision.  Perhaps there should be some sort of<br>
mandatory counseling both before and after the procedure, but the right<br>
to choose must be maintained.  A woman (and hopefully the father, too)<br>
can alway s choose not to have an abortion.<br>

Thanx to everyone for your prayers for Reds Eberhardt.<br>
He was released from the hospital yesterday morning.<br>
The doctor told him he could resume his normal activities,<br>
but Reds didn't tell him everything about his activities.<br>
I saw his truck parked in the church parking lot as I<br>
was on my way to work this morning.<br>
Reds called me today and said he was going to<br>
rake the gravel in the church driveway and parking lot.<br>
I'm sure he'll be mowing the lawn tomorrow.<br>
<p>
Reds thanks you for your prayers, too.<br>
<p>
God is good!<br>
<p>
Peace,<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;This past Sabbath we were treated to a special music of that old standby</i><br>
<i>&gt;of many evangelistic meetings, "Are You Ready For Jesus To Come."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I present the chorus, and then a way I thought of to revise it slightly</i><br>
<i>&gt;to provide a bit more hope.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The original...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you ready for Jesus to come?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you faithful in all that you do?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Have you fought a good fight?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Have you stood for the right?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Can others see Jesus in you?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you ready to stand in your place?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you ready to look on His face?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Can you look up and say, "This is my Lord."</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you ready for Jesus to come?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;New and improved....</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jesus is ready for you to come</i><br>
<i>&gt;He is faithful in all that you do</i><br>
<i>&gt;He has fought the good fight</i><br>
<i>&gt;He has stood for the right,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Helps others see Jesus in you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;He already has stood in your place</i><br>
<i>&gt;He wants you to look on His face</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can look up and say "This is my lord"</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jesus is ready for you to come...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What do you think?</i><br>
I like it a lot<br>

This past Sabbath we were treated to a special music of that old standby<br>
of many evangelistic meetings, "Are You Ready For Jesus To Come."<br>
<p>
I present the chorus, and then a way I thought of to revise it slightly<br>
to provide a bit more hope.<br>
<p>
The original...<br>
<p>
Are you ready for Jesus to come?<br>
Are you faithful in all that you do?<br>
Have you fought a good fight?<br>
Have you stood for the right?<br>
Can others see Jesus in you?<br>
Are you ready to stand in your place?<br>
Are you ready to look on His face?<br>
Can you look up and say, "This is my Lord."<br>
Are you ready for Jesus to come?<br>
<p>
<p>
New and improved....<br>
Jesus is ready for you to come<br>
He is faithful in all that you do<br>
He has fought the good fight<br>
He has stood for the right,<br>
Helps others see Jesus in you.<br>
He already has stood in your place<br>
He wants you to look on His face<br>
You can look up and say "This is my lord"<br>
Jesus is ready for you to come...<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
What do you think?<br>

I received two fairly long files today from a friend at La Sierra.  One<br>
is entitled "Finding God in Cyberspace" and the other is entitled "Guide<br>
to Christian Resources on the Internet."  Because of their length, I'm<br>
not forwarding to the net.  However, anyone who would like to get a<br>
copy, please contact me and I'll be glad to forward it.<br>

Adventist girl and adventist boy in long-standing relationship<br>
have a nasty breakup. Later, girl meets another boy, they become<br>
friends, they date, and then become engaged. A few months before<br>
the wedding date, girl is visited by ex-boyfriend at night. <br>
After a confrontation she is raped by ex-boyfriend, and <br>
consequently falls pregnant. There is no question over the<br>
identity of the father, as this has been the only opportunity<br>
for conception. Ex-boyfriend, upon finding out that girl is<br>
pregnant, makes it clear that he will expect to have a part<br>
in the upbringing of the child.<br>
<p>
&lt;DELETED&gt;<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hypothetically, the ex-boyfriend is a criminal, should not have<br>
ANY say-so in the upbringing of the child, and should be thrown<br>
in jail for his heinous behavior.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, I believe in turning the other cheek (and sometimes<br>
this is one of the hardest things Christians are called upon to do),<br>
but the ex-boyfriend would be truly blessed to escape a beating<br>
from the husband-to-be, the girl's father, and/or her brother(s).<br>
<p>
I'll share an incident from my childhood.  My Dad and I were<br>
walking home one afternoon, and my father stopped to chat with<br>
one of the teenage boys from the high school across the street.<br>
This boy's name was Jerome, and he was 17.  I was 12 at the time.<br>
Jerome was "friend of the family."<br>
<p>
While my Dad was talking with Jerome, I saw one of my friends,<br>
another girl who was 12.  When I heard my Dad tell Jerome that<br>
he'd see him later, I ended my conversation with my friend, and<br>
hurried to catch up with my Dad.  I was about 10 feet away from<br>
Dad, when Jerome caught my arm and tried to pull me toward him,<br>
whispering something vulgar.  I immediately called out, "Dad,<br>
help me!"  My father took one look, saw me struggling to pull<br>
away from Jerome, and quickly walked over to where we were.<br>
I won't tell you the specifics, but my father was steaming!<br>
He let Jerome know in no uncertain terms what would happen<br>
to him if he ever dared to try to touch me again.  From that point,<br>
whenever Jerome saw me, he would cross the street to avoid<br>
passing me, and I made it a point to always have one of my<br>
friends with me when I went anywhere.<br>
<p>
We lived across the street from DuSable High School, and one<br>
block from the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago.  I used to hear<br>
about incidents of rape, but it didn't really sink in about how<br>
defenseless a girl or woman could be until the situation with<br>
Jerome.  At that point in my life, I really began paying close<br>
attention to my parents' instructions, and it has served me well.<br>
<p>
Have a pleasant evening!<br>
<p>

Thanks, Bill. I will try to get that information and compile an "independent"<br>
report if the data will support production of a meaningful report. Of course,<br>
at work, I would produce a report anyway... It would just mean that<br>
more prettier colors would be used. :)<br>

<i>&gt; Much discussion has been going on regarding whether abortion is right or</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong and when life begins, but it seems to me the most important issue</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the big abortion question in this country is the issue of choice.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; do not believe that abortions are a good thing.  I don't see how any</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christian can support abortions (there are always exceptions and</i><br>
<i>&gt; hypothetical situations that can be raised, of course).  However, I am </i><br>
<i>&gt; pro-choice.  I belive that a woman should have the right to choose to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have an abortion.  I don't think the government should be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; regulate such a personal decision.  Perhaps there should be some sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; mandatory counseling both before and after the procedure, but the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; to choose must be maintained.  A woman (and hopefully the father, too)</i><br>
<i>&gt; can alway s choose not to have an abortion.</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ===============</i><br>
What about the baby (foetus), does it not have a choice? The right to <br>
choose is practical as long as one person's choice does not overlook <br>
the other person's choice. Think on this. <br>

Great!  We will add the three of you to our prayer list as well!<br>

You are absolutely right and she has made a fantastic turnaround after<br>
"being sorry".   I think that all it took was her getting some much<br>
needed sleep, and us praying together, and my hugging her and the babies, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My wife and I pray our baby will be healthy, but if for</i><br>

<p>
And as God has promised, "I will not remove from him my steadfast love,<br>
or be false to my faithfulness.  I will not violate my covenant, or alter<br>
the word that went forth from my lips."  Psalms 89:33,34  I refer to this<br>
as my all encompassing promise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The surgery will go fine; tell your wife what a marvelous thing she and </i><br>

<i>&gt; Adventist girl and adventist boy in long-standing relationship</i><br>

<i>&gt; friends, they date, and then become engaged. A few months before</i><br>
<i>&gt; the wedding date, girl is visited by ex-boyfriend at night. </i><br>
<i>&gt; After a confrontation she is raped by ex-boyfriend, and </i><br>

<i>&gt; pregnant, makes it clear that he will expect to have a part</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the upbringing of the child.</i><br>
<p>
Ex-boyfriend, aka RAPIST, belongs in a jail cell, not demanding his "rights"<br>
with regards to his biological offspring. (Under God's Law [Deut. 22:25],<br>
he'd reside under a pile of rocks.) Since when does a rapist have legal<br>
standing to get custody and/or visitation rights?  Since, as you've stated,<br>
it's a hypothetical case, put him in jail for a while, and if you parole<br>
him, make one of the conditions that he avoid contact with his victim and<br>
the child completely.<br>
<p>
Also, if the boy is supposedly an "Adventist", doesn't some sort of church<br>
discipline fit in there somewhere?  Surely no one is suggesting that what he<br>
"chose to do with his body" is a valid choice that he rest of us aren't free<br>
to question or judge.  Any sin might, ultimately, be a "choice", but not one<br>
devoid of consequences and penalties.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It's ridiculous using such hypotheticals as this in these </i><br>
<i>&gt; discussions, isn't it. All I can say is, if hypothetically</i><br>
<i>&gt; you happen to find yourself praying one of these days, perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; you could spare a thought for this hypothetical girl and her</i><br>
<i>&gt; fiance - pray that they can now live with whatever hypothetical</i><br>
<i>&gt; decision they may have made in this case.</i><br>
<p>
Has such a case ever occurred?  If so, how was it eventually decided? What's<br>
the alternative?  Kill the child to "protect" it from its criminal father?<br>
<p>
I'd pooh-pooh the idea if Dr. Kevorkian hadn't popularized and<br>
commercialized the notion of death as a "solution" to one's problems.<br>

That would be like holding seminars on "safe bank robbery", methinks!  The<br>
point is, no sin is "safe", perhaps because God designed things that way.<br>
While what you're hypothesizing would be slightly preferable to abortion, I<br>
suppose, it's not the BEST solution.<br>
<p>
I don't know what "Operation Rescue" would do.  What do you suppose YOUR<br>
pastor would do if someone tried that in the middle of one of the services<br>
at YOUR church?<br>

I happen to think that Roe vs Wade is not bad law.  It simply establishes<br>
certain guidelines that should be followed, if an abortion is chosen,<br>
and protects the right of the mother to chose such.  In doing such, it<br>
upholds one of the fundamental rights of a human being, that of controlling<br>
ones body.  Additionally, it upholds the bill of rights.<br>
<p>
As to long waiting lists for adoption, that is only because most adoptive<br>
parents are not willing to accept older black children, or handicapped.<br>
Sexually abused children are not generally wanted for adoption.  My wife<br>
has been looking over my shoulder as I write this, and making me correct<br>
things that I had written (grin).  She has been extensively researching<br>
the topic, because we may adopt a kid.  <br>
<p>
To me, it is moraly wrong to bring a child into the world in the state<br>
that it is in.  It is wrong for me to burden the world with one more<br>
mouth to feed.  I sincerely do not believe that I could cope with the<br>
guilt.  Of course that is but one reason that the decision has been<br>
made.  There are many others.<br>
<p>
Cheers<br>

I would like any and all suggestions for the following:<br>
<p>
My church tried to have 2 Sabbath School classes but the one was so<br>
small that the few of us who decide these things felt we'd benefit most<br>
by all meeting together.  The class roll consists of the following<br>
people - our entire church, except for 3 adults who work with the kids:<br>
1 bachelor - 50's, hi school ed<br>
3 widows - 70's, hi school ed<br>
1 bachelor - 40's, college student<br>
2 single mom's - 30's (neither baptized SDA), college students<br>
1 married couple - 60's (parents of other 2 couples)<br>
1 married couple - 40's (professionals)<br>
1 married couple - 30's with new 1st baby, (professionals, 1 nonSDA)<br>
1 married man - 50's, plumber<br>
1 married woman - 60's housewife, elem school ed<br>
me, single - 30's, professional<br>
<p>
Several of the above attend sporadically and I counted how many of the<br>
above speak in class - 8 of them talk at least once in awhile, lessstudy<br>
the lesson or have much knowledge of the Bible, etc.  One of the<br>
quietestmembers told me she wished we could have 2 classes again and<br>
that one of them would be for younger people, more in tune with where<br>
she is (non-SDA, single mom, little knowledge).  I see that we aren't<br>
really helping her feel a part of us, she says she doesn't get anything<br>
from the study, etc. and I see that certainly her social needs aren't<br>
met.  She's not the only one, others have talked about not feeling<br>
revived/renewed/uplifted/whatever word fits for them.  I know part of<br>
the answer lies with them but what can the church do with limited<br>
people, time, energy, resources?  Only about 4-5 of us attend the board<br>
meetings, prayer meetings, plan the socials, invite people into our<br>
homes, etc. and now the school year is starting and some of us won't<br>
have the time we did in the summer.<br>
<p>
Suggestions for Sabbath School in particular?  or anything else?<br>

<p>
The way I was raised on this was that there is a trial going on...<br>
<p>
The universe (the perfect portion) is the jury, God is the accused,<br>
Jesus is the defense attorney, Satan is the prosecuting attorney,<br>
and we are the evidence, and in this case, there is no judge.<br>
<p>
God already knows the outcome, but the jury is to be convinced so that<br>
when this is all over, there will be no question in anyone's mind that<br>
sin "just ain't worth it".<br>
<p>
God is the accused because He created us, giving us free will, allowing<br>
us to choose Him or another.<br>
<p>
Jesus is the defense attorney (I wouldn't want any other) who has been<br>
through what the evidence has been through, and much more.<br>
<p>
Satan is the prosecuting attorney because he want's to prove that God's<br>
way isn't the right choice.<br>
<p>
We are the evidence, because it is our free will to select God or Satan<br>
as our role model and leader.<br>

Since death is similar to sleep, the next thing someone knows after death<br>
is the resurrection.  Therefore, as far as the person who died is<br>
concerned, he was alive in a sinful environment, and the next waking<br>
moment he is alive in a sinless environment.  With this understanding,<br>
there is no contradiction.<br>

It might be useful if you supply Bible references.  I remember some of the<br>

<p>
Fred,<br>
<p>
Do you have any other Bible references besides the parable in Matthew 18? <br>
We all know that parables can be pushed too far, as in the case of the<br>
rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31).  Also, what supporting evidence can<br>
you supply for your assertion that the times of refreshing occur at the<br>
end of the anti-typical Day of Atonement?<br>

-&gt;&gt; One thing that is not in dispute, however, is that once a sperm and ovum<br>
-&gt;&gt; unite, a unique combination of genes is created which has the potential to grow<br>
-&gt;&gt; into a living human being.  I think the debate could sometimes be carried<br>
-&gt;&gt; farther if we were to say:  "all right, the fetus may not be alive, but<br>
-&gt;&gt; it has a unique potential for life.  How shall we protect that potential life?"<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;I think it could be carried even further. Having intercourse may not result <br>
-&gt;in a new life, but the potential exists. Should we discourage contraception to <br>
-&gt;protect this potential for life?<br>
-&gt;<br>
<p>
 An obvious difference is that in the case of the fetus, there is an <br>
 object to be protected, but in the latter example, one is merely <br>
 protecting and abstraction.<br>

-&gt;Strive to Be Among the 144,000<br>
-&gt;<br>
-&gt;"Let us strive with all the power that God has given us to be among the hundred<br>
-&gt;and forty-four thousand.  And let us do all that we can to help others to gain<br>
-&gt;heaven."--Review and Herald, March 9, 1905.<br>
-&gt;<br>
<p>
 The idea just popped into my head that if one were to hold that <br>
 exactly 144,000 persons are going to be saved, then taking one's <br>
 position as one of the 144,000 would de facto mean that someone<br>
 else would be lost. <br>

<i>&gt;Something marvellous did happen in 1844 . Exactly what did</i><br>

<i>&gt;and that there is a heavenly sanctuary in which God is,</i><br>

<p>
Craig Kinzer responded:<br>
This leaves me with a big question.  An intermediary is one who settles<br>
disputes, reconciles disagreements.  If this is Jesus' job, He is working <br>
for at least two parties.  Who are these two (or more) parties?<br>
<p>
My 2 cents:<br>
<p>
The way I see it, Jesus is the mediator, and He intercedes<br>
on mankind's behalf, to reconcile us to our Heavenly Father.<br>
<p>
John 14:1=AD6:<br>
"Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe<br>
also in Me.<br>
"In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so,<br>
I would have told you.   I go to prepare a place for you.<br>
"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again<br>
and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may<br>
be also.<br>
"And where I go you know, and the way you know."<br>
Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are<br>
going, and how can we know the way?"<br>
Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.<br>
No one comes to the Father except through Me."<br>
<p>
Hebrews 7:24, 25 says, "But He [Jesus], because<br>
He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.  Therefore<br>
He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to<br>
God through Him, since He ever lives to make intercession<br>
for them."<br>
<p>
Without Jesus, mankind would be doomed to eternal separation<br>
from God, and eventual annihilation.  What a horrible thought!<br>
But God loves mankind, and "is longsuffering toward us, not<br>
willing that any should perish but that all should come to<br>
repentance" (II Peter 3:9).<br>
<p>
Have a pleasant evening!<br>

<p>
"Safe bank robbery"?  Gimme a break!<br>
<p>
There are two issues involved here.  There's your statement that "no sin<br>
is safe" used in the context of describing contraception.  Whether<br>
contraception is a sin depends on whom you talk to.  Certainly the Roman<br>
Catholic wing of the anti-abortion movement is also going to be<br>
anti-contraception [if they're following the party line laid down in the<br>
encyclical _Humanae Vitae_].  Their thinking is that the entire<br>
procreative process is God-directed and shouldn't involve human<br>
tampering.<br>
<p>
Second is the question of conscience.  The biggest problem I've had with<br>
the abortion question has nothing to do with such esoterica as when life<br>
begins.  It all comes down to: whose life is it, yours or Pat<br>
Robertson's?  Who made him [and others in the anti-abortion movement]<br>
the arbiters of moral choice in this society?  Whether one agrees with<br>
them in any particular question is another issue.  When someone sets it<br>
up so you have no choice in moral questions, are you really being all<br>
that religious on your own?<br>
<p>
I've got no answers -- just a bunch more interesting questions.  Some of<br>
them involve my cat.<br>

IF Ellen White is merely an anachronism of the 19th century,<br>
and IF the 2300 days did not end in 1844,<br>
what reason is there for a denomination called the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist Church?<br>
<p>
IF there is no special significance to the heavenly sanctuary<br>
with regard to Daniel 8:14, why do we bother to perpetuate<br>
our church?<br>
<p>
If there are no special or unique messages or beliefs<br>
why should we continue? Why not disband and drop it all<br>
as a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT?<br>

<p>
Here I go, running in where angels fear to tread.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Believe it or not, there are now synthetic blood subsitutes.</i><br>
<p>
So what?  There are synthetic lungs as well.  What does that prove?<br>
We can keep you alive (?) while your lungs are being replaced.  You<br>
certainly are not breathing during that multi-hour procedure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Life is in the Blood, only in the sense that the blood provides</i><br>
<i>&gt; nutrients, and gasses to the cells, and removes waste products.</i><br>
<p>
Here's a news flash for you: the blood that circulates within the<br>
blood vessels of a developing fetus does what you just defined to be<br>
life.  Would you care to draw a consistent conclusion?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think the way the bible puts it, is once again a cultural artifact</i><br>
<i>&gt; in this sense:  Back then science was an empirical thing.  You let</i><br>
<i>&gt; the blood out of an animal, and it dies.  Therefore the life is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the blood.  I think that the Lord had to put it that way, so the</i><br>
<i>&gt; people could understand.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, please!  What kind of hermeneutics is this?  You think that God<br>
could not have gotten the point across that life is in the breathing?<br>
You think no one ever drowned back then?  When a drowning victim was<br>
recovered, even with all his blood intact, I am sure those ignorant<br>
people understood that he was dead, and that he died for lack of<br>
breathing.<br>
<p>

I will share observations from our small church...(not as small as what your's<br>
sounds like though).  First, we ended the pre-lesson study time.  It was poorly<br>
attended and frustrating for those who put the effort in to make it<br>
interesting.  Now we have lesson study time from 9:30 - 10:30.  It seems to be<br>
received ok from all (more or less).<br>
<p>
As for lesson study, we had 4 adult classes, 1 for young adults, 1 for new<br>
believers ("Pastor's class"), and 2 for the older members (we have few middle<br>
aged adults...when their kids reach teen years, they move to other metro area<br>
churches that are the "IN" spots for teens).  The teacher for the young adults<br>
class was unreliable in his arrival time or attendence.  Although he was a very<br>
knowledgeable teacher and an interesting class, his poor attendence led to a<br>
dwindling class attendence and finally it died.  Those who were in the yound<br>
adults class switched to the "pastor's class", which in turn went back to<br>
studying the lesson instead of SDA 27 Fund. Beliefs book.  We had a young<br>
pastor for a year and during that time this class grew to be large and popular.<br>
 He did an excellent job in lesson study time.  After he left, this spring, we<br>
have now tried to split this "pastors class" into a "pastors class" and a<br>
"contemporary issues" class.<br>
<p>
I believe the key to a good SS lesson study class is in the teacher.<br>
 Unfortunately, there are precious few who are skilled in being teachers and<br>
who put the time in to prepare.  Ideally, no SS adult class should ever be more<br>
than about 12 people, ideally 8-10.  Otherwise discussion is stiffled and the<br>
shy people won't speak up.  You'll hear plenty from the vocal people.  But how<br>
do we get more qualified teachers?<br>
<p>
Our successful pastor's class was largely due to his excited enthusiasm that he<br>
brought to the class each week.  Enthusiasm is KEY I believe.  He smiled alot,<br>
asked questions that got you thinking, pushed boundries of our thinking,<br>
bordering on the controversial, yet making a point out of it before the time<br>
was up.<br>
<p>
Being prepared is important, and knowledgeable on teaching techniques.  I'd<br>
like to see more people willing to learn how to teach.  I'd like to see<br>
training classes offered to teach and then good attendence by church members.<br>
 There are many who could learn to teach.  It adds to your self esteem and<br>
benefits all aspects of your life (work, social gatherings, phone<br>
conversations, etc).  Gives the self confidence to project your image more<br>
boldly.<br>
<p>
Meeting the needs of the class members is also KEY.  If topics aren't discussed<br>
in a relavent way, the members at some point may ask why they are coming to SS.<br>
 The topics of our "contemporary issues" class were highly rated as wanting to<br>
discuss them.  So you might try to find a teacher willing to tackle this kind<br>
of class.  He doesn't need to know the answers, let the class dig for<br>
that...but find someone who exudes enthusiasm, intelligence, and a willingness<br>
to lead it.<br>
<p>
Anyway, hopefully this has helped a little bit in what you are trying to<br>
accomplish, no real specific answers but experience from our situation.<br>

I sometimes wonder about the arguments running back and forth pro and anti<br>
abortion.  One point of interest is the one with regard to the viability of <br>
an infant once it has left the mothers womb.  It is assumed by some that <br>
once an infant becomes viable that it can then be regarded as a human being.  <br>
My problem is where do we define the point of viability.<br>
<p>
Strictly speaking a newborn infant is non-viable.  Leave one lying on its <br>
own for a few days and see how long it lives for.  Even ones that are looked <br>
after can die.  I recall hearing about a certain orphanage in England that <br>
had many babies that were cared for very well but they died at very high <br>
percentage rates.  It turned out that apart from being fed and cleaned the <br>
babies were handled very little and died from emotional starvation.<br>
<p>
I would have thought that the point of viability comes when the child is <br>
able to fend for itself which technically means they would be a minimum of <br>
ten years old.  On this basis I view the argument of viability of an infant <br>
as a case for abortion with suspicion.  My twin boys could not even breath <br>
properly without oxygen enrichment for the first few days after they were <br>
born.  They even had to be in humidicribs so be sure of surviving.  We were <br>
told that they had a 95% chance of surviving.  That theoretically meant that <br>
they had a 5% chance of being "non-viable".<br>
<p>
As it was they were non-viable outside the hospital.  So when I stood there <br>
and looked at my babies lying there in their cribs should I have looked at <br>
them as human beings or should I have seen them as packages of flesh and <br>
blood that one day would hopefully become human beings.  I don't believe the <br>
argument of viability will give me a correct answer on this one.<br>

Of course the father is a criminal, and should be jailed. Cases like this,<br>
though, are rarely that simple. Even victims of aggravated rape are sometimes<br>
put through hell by the police and the courts - how about someone who not<br>
only had a previous relationship with the alleged attacker, but who <br>
voluntarily granted him entry to her home? And as for church discipline,<br>
all you have to do to escape that is come from the right family and have<br>
the right friends.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Has such a case ever occurred?  If so, how was it eventually decided? What's</i><br>
<i>&gt; the alternative?  Kill the child to "protect" it from its criminal father?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not about to trot out people's personal decisions for others to hash<br>
over, especially those who have never had to deal with anything like this.<br>
It seems that, especially in a debate, people are all too ready to point<br>
fingers and ignore the fact that others are suffering through very real<br>
traumas. "She never should have let him into the house" "It's the fault<br>
of the Australian court system that rape victims are treated that way" <br>
"She didn't scream loud enough" "Maybe it wasn't _really_ rape" "Surely<br>
she could have stopped him if she really wanted to" or whatever.<br>
<p>
What if I was the fiance in this story? Could I expect any more sensitivity<br>
then? Or are we the kind of Christians who stick our upstanding, never-<br>
really-tested morals in people's faces regardless of their personal hurts?<br>
Let's not forget that of all the faceless subscribers to SDAnet, we<br>
know very little about many of their backgrounds or experiences. <br>
<p>
One thing's for sure, if I _was_ the fiance in this story, Cori has<br>
correctly identified the outcome. I doubt whether my Christianity is <br>
sufficient to hold me back. (Of course, assault is much more easy to<br>
prove in court than rape, so then it would be _me_ behind bars.)<br>

Hello !<br>
       In last time I have read many posts about Christ in the Sanctuary.<br>
One of them shows Heb 6:19 as a "proof" to say that Jesus go into the <br>
Most Holy Place just after his asention (sp ?) to Heaven. This fact gave<br>
opotunity for a discusion about the mobility of God's trone.<br>
<p>
       It is true that, in the Bible, verses like Heb 6:19 make refference<br>
to the MHP but in the context of Hebrews can be a little different. In<br>
chapter 9 of Hebrew ( I do not remember exactly the verse ) Paul the <br>
MHP is after the SECOND veil. Logicaly if there is a second veil then<br>
there is a first one (that make separation between th <br>
<p>
<p>
e Holy Place and<br>
the exterior ). I think this is the veil refered by Heb 6:19. If it is <br>
so, the verse speaks about Christ gone into the Holy Place and there is not<br>
contradiction with the usual SDA interpretetion of the 2300 days in Dan 8:14.<br>
<p>
                                          Your brother in Christ<br>
<p>
                                             Alfonso Zerwekh<br>

Please give more details about that Gold Card? Do you have an application form<br>

Do you think that in the heaven  we are going to use an entry system? We have<br>

<i>&gt;On Aug 11, Bill Sands, Jr. wrote a number of things, including:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Something marvellous did happen in 1844 . Exactly what did</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;happen is still open to study. The major thing which happened</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;as far as I am concerned is that the opening of the spiritual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;eyes to see that Earth is not the center of the universe,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and that there is a heavenly sanctuary in which God is,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and Jesus is there as my intermediary. This is a major</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;shift in focus, and opens the eyes to eternal verities.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This leaves me with a big question.  An intermediary is one who settles</i><br>
<i>&gt;disputes, reconciles disagreements.  If this is Jesus' job, He is working </i><br>
<i>&gt;for at least two parties.  Who are these two (or more) parties?</i><br>

    One part is God (the Father) and the other is the man (we). It is clear when<br>
we see the consequences of our sin..<br>

So far, only certain churches are able to do this, however it may not <br>

By phrasing this sentence this way, it sounds like you are strongly impliing<br>
that the Spirit can only lead the conference committee/administrators who<br>
"send" the pastors to their churches and CAN'T lead a local churches search<br>
committee members.    <br>
<p>
I think that far too often when the conference places a call for a pastor,<br>
or when they decide to swap a few pastors around from church to church;<br>
it may be done based on other factors other than purely the Lord's or Spirit's<br>
leading.  Especially those conferences who have a strong history of moving<br>
pastor's around on a fairly regular basis every 4-5 years or sometimes less. <br>
<p>
The early church in the New Testament allowed churches a certain degree<br>
of latitude in placing their calls for pastors, etc.  I feel that it may<br>
not be such a bad idea for today as well.<br>
<p>
I firmly believe that the Lord and the Spirit can lead a local churches <br>
decision for a specific pastor or list of pastors just as easily and as<br>
effectually as They can lead a conference administration or committee. <br>

Amy:<br>
	I am sorry about the loss in your family. And thanks for spelling <br>
out so clearly and short the stages that we go through when arriving to a <br>
new church.<br>
	Now, I have seen in my life how many new happy starts have become <br>
a mess afterward. I now that we are not supouse to make every body happy <br>
because that will be avoiding being stable, direct and honest. But, I <br>
care about the happyness of everybody in my church. I also care about the <br>
spiritual life of each member. And many times, when addressing those <br>
issues, relationships becomes sticky and rough. How can we extend the <br>
honeymoon phase longer. Or how can we move to a more realistic but glad <br>
phases?<br>
	Something else. I know that in counseling we are not supouse to <br>
give to much advise. Because that will be de direct counseling and indirect <br>
counseling will develop more independence and stronger will in the <br>
client. But pastors are expected to say something, to act, to take <br>
control of the situation and lead. How can we better look for a middle road?<br>
<p>
Amy, is good to have somebody to discuss this issues with.<br>

One might say that the Roman Catholic Church brought us Martin Luther,<br>
having been one of its priests, and thus, indirectly, the Protestant<br>
reformation.  Does that fact argue for the validity of Roman Catholicism?<br>
<p>
I'd suspect that the Jehovah's Witnesses prediction of the Second Coming of<br>
Christ in 1914 caused a number of Christians (and maybe a few<br>
non-Christians) to read their Bibles, but that beneficial side effect does<br>
not vindicate the false prophecy.  One could ask, rhetorically, "what<br>
happened in 1914".  A lot of things happened, obviously.  But what's<br>
important is that what was PREDICTED to occur that year didn't.  Yes, they<br>
promptly came up with what "really happened", including a re-interpretation<br>
that Jesus' "return to earth" in 1914 was not PHYSICAL after all, but merely<br>
"spiritual".  IOW, rather than admitting their error, they attempted to<br>
explain their way out of it.  Would you be so charitable with them as you<br>
seem to be with Miller?<br>
<p>
First of all, the SDA church has distinctive doctrines other than a belief<br>
in 1844.  If it was a movement that God chose to bring about, then He was<br>
not limited to using a man who misled his followers into giving away their<br>
possessions, quitting their jobs, etc. in the vain hope of a literal Second<br>
Coming in 1844.  EGW could presumably have had her visions without having<br>
associated with Miller.  The fact that God managed to use him is no more a<br>
vindication of him than Judas' instrumental role in bringing about Jesus'<br>
arrest and  crucifixion, and thus our salvation, somehow absolves him of his<br>
guilt for betraying Christ.<br>

 Hi,<br>
 <br>
 There have been several posts discussing viability, life, potential <br>
 for life, and so on.  Here's just one more thing to think about.<br>
 <br>
 I believe that it is considered a crime to destroy a fertilized egg <br>
 of a California Condor or other endangered species.  <br>
 <br>
 No, human's are not on the endangered species list, but... :-)<br>

    I just recently saw a program where they showed a medical procedure which<br>
would apply along the lines of this topic.  There's a condition where some<br>
people get a swollen blood vessel in the brain.  Well, there is this man that<br>
the blood vessel was swollen to the size of a golf ball. If that vessel were<br>
to burst, he would die.  Normally the swollen blood vessel is operated on but<br>
that was not possible because of the size.<br>
    A doctor realized that at low temperatures the brain will survive for<br>
some time without oxygen, so he developed a procedure in which the<br>
temperature of the patient is dropped with ice packs and then the heart is<br>
stopped.  The doctor then has up to one hour to operate on the patient<br>
without danger of the blood vesses bursting. Of course this is a procedure<br>
that is used as a last resort. <br>
    They showed tha patient after the operation and he was like a little<br>
child. He had to learn how to talk all over again. But eventually he will<br>
regain his memories and be back to normal.<br>
    I found this amazing.  We are able to stop a persons heart and then<br>
restart it again with minimal consequences to the person.<br>

<i>&gt;  I believe that it is considered a crime to destroy a fertilized egg </i><br>
<i>&gt;  of a California Condor or other endangered species.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  No, human's are not on the endangered species list, but... :-)</i><br>
<p>
And I'll bet that if there was an organization that got PAID to destroy<br>
condor eggs, the political left and even the "religious left" would picket,<br>
march, protest, hand out leaflets on the sidewalk, block access, and engage<br>
in various other acts of civil disobedience in response.  Those who have<br>
done so to save spotted owls, whales, and harp seals have not been nearly as<br>
vilified as pro-life activists have been, even those whose "crime" was<br>
praying on a public sidewalk in violation of an injunction.<br>
<p>
As for man not being an endangered species, it depends on how you look at<br>
it.  With declining birth rates, many countries are wondering how a<br>
declining number of younger, working people can support a growing number of<br>
older, retiring people.  As for this country, I understand that the only<br>
reason the population continues to grow is due to immigration and longer<br>
lifespans.<br>

Re: A Peculiar People?<br>
<p>
A while back (August 17) Bill Sands asked:<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>	&gt; IF Ellen White is merely an anachronism of the 19th century,</i><br>
<i>	&gt; and IF the 2300 days did not end in 1844,</i><br>
<i>	&gt; what reason is there for a denomination called the</i><br>
<i>	&gt; Seventh-day Adventist Church?</i><br>
<p>
<i>	&gt; IF there is no special significance to the heavenly sanctuary</i><br>
<i>	&gt; with regard to Daniel 8:14, why do we bother to perpetuate</i><br>
<i>	&gt; our church?</i><br>
<p>
<i>	&gt; If there are no special or unique messages or beliefs</i><br>
<i>	&gt; why should we continue? Why not disband and drop it all</i><br>
<i>	&gt; as a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT?</i><br>
<p>
<i>	&gt; Bill Sands, Jr.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
First, I don't believe EGW was merely an anachronism.  Next topic....<br>
<p>
The reason I am an SDA today is definitely not because of what may or may <br>
not have happened in Oct. 1844.   The composite picture that the SDA package<br>
of beliefs portray of God is what keeps me a member of this church despite<br>
the fact I have definite reservations about the traditional Adventist teaching<br>
on the sanctuary.  <br>
<p>
Adventist doctrines show me a God who: <br>
- ultimately believes in freedom of choice for His creatures <br>
- cares about the multi-dimensional aspects of His creatures <br>
- insightfully provided a special time for us to strengthen our relationships <br>
  with Him and each other <br>
- shows incredible wisdom, patience, love and the ultimate in self-sacrifice <br>
  for the universe in His dealing with the sin problem <br>
- hates the notion of losing any one and will *not* inflict an eternity of <br>
  pain on those who choose against accepting His gracious overtures to us<br>
- wants to reason with us and draw us towards Him because He has earned our<br>
  trust, respect and our desire to emulate Him<br>
<p>
I find no other church that presents such a package and is Biblically based<br>
to the extent that I find the SDA church.  Thus, I remain a member here.<br>
<p>
To tell you the truth, Bill, I've never personally met anyone who became an<br>
Adventist because s/he was attracted by the sanctuary doctrine.  Most SDAs<br>
I know joined for other reasons, don't really understand or can rationally<br>
explain this doctrine to a non-SDA, and don't believe it affects the way we<br>
live our lives if Christ moved into the most holy place of the sanctuary in<br>
1844 vs. went directly into it at His ascension.  I count myself among them<br>
and I am constantly baffled when I hear it stated that without the sanctuary<br>
doctrine, Adventism makes no contribution to theology.  (I don't know if you <br>
are saying this.)  Personally, I don't really care if we have no unique <br>
doctrines to contribute.  In fact I would think since we claim to be <br>
theologically in synch. with Adam and Eve, Moses, Christ, Paul, and John the <br>
Revelator, we should have very little new theology to add.  Our contribution <br>
should be an emphasis on the message the Bible shows God trying to communicate <br>
to the human race since the creation.  We should continue as a denomination <br>
because new or old, unique or ubiquitous, our goal is to present the gospel <br>
as we see it expressed in the Bible.  If there happens to be someone else with <br>
the same message we have, fantastic!  (If there is another group with our same<br>
teachings except for the sanctuary, I'd like to know who they are.)  Our focus <br>
is a continual search for truth and a desire to be inwardly changed to live it.<br>

More from abortion....<br>
<p>
Considering firstly - if you don't want children, avoid sex. Well, I did read<br>
before I got married that a couple getting married should be prepared for<br>
children even if not planning them. I can't say I would have been pleased to<br>
have fallen pregnant in any of the time we've been married so far. And I<br>
get the impression that taking such drastic action to avoid children while<br>
married would not be beneficial, and is certainly not biblical.<br>
<p>
But lets take it further. Not a lot has been said about contraception<br>
really.<br>
<p>
It seems we as SDAs are happy to use contraception to better plan our<br>
families. Is this true? We generally don't like to consider abortion because <br>
we value life. This value of life extends to other arenas.<br>
<p>
Do you think it is OK for an SDA to use contraception to avoid having<br>
children altogether?<br>
<p>
What _kind_ of contraception? <br>
<p>
IUDs act to expell fertilized eggs from the<br>
body. A fertilized egg is the beginning of somebody. Is this like abortion?<br>
Is it OK for an SDA to use this method of contraception? _Do_ SDAs use this<br>
method of contraception?<br>
<p>
The IUD can't be too different from this new "abortion drug" RU235 (?) being<br>
trialled can it?<br>
<p>
The "morning after" pill is taken after the egg is fertilized. Could this be<br>
an unfavourable thing for an SDA?<br>
<p>
Do SDAs consider carefully the _kinds_ of contraceptives - not just their<br>
effectiveness but also their "humanitarian" aspects?<br>
<p>
Comments?<br>

<i>&gt; I just received this note from Rich Wales and I am unable to shed any light on</i><br>
<i>&gt; any "Reform Movement" for him.  How about any of you out there?  Also, I am </i><br>
<i>&gt; interested in this information myself, since I've not yet come across this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Here is Rich's message.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;From	CRL::"richw@mks.com" "Rich Wales"  7-AUG-1994 15:49:41.06</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subj:	Question about "SDA Reform Movement"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While driving through southeastern Ontario (Niagara peninsula) yester-</i><br>
<i>&gt; day, I noticed a church with a sign reading as follows:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 			Welcome to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 			CHURCH OF THE</i><br>
<i>&gt; 		    SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST</i><br>
<i>&gt; 		       Reform Movement</i><br>
<p>
This title is not at all familiar to me.  I have not heard of any "concerned<br>
brethern" (CBs in Oz, which I believe is what George Tasker is thinking),<br>
"historic SDAs", or any such establishing churches with any name other than<br>
the standard "Seventh-day Adventist", no more, no less.  Thus, I would suspect<br>
we're looking at a small off-shoot group here. (FWIW, there are Davidians and<br>
Branch Davidians in Ontario, some near Huntsville, I think.)<br>
<p>
There is a major off-shoot called the "Reformed Seventh-day Adventist" church.<br>
I am aware of congregations in Colorado, California, and Ontario.  A somewhat<br>
simplistic explanation of their origins:  During WWI, there was a major<br>
disagreement in Germany over whether SDA young men should bear arms or not<br>
when drafted into the Kaiser's army.  Absent a "conscientious objectors"-type<br>
arrangement, some US-side SDA leaders (A.G. Daniells, I believe) counseled<br>
that German believers could, in good conscience, go ahead and bear arms.<br>
Given that SDA pioneer leaders in the US (and elsewhere?) recommended strongly<br>
against bearing arms in the military (for certain biblical reasons), certain<br>
German believers felt this (new) position an unconscionable compromise (dare<br>
one say "apostasy"?).  Evidently tempers, personalities, and church politics<br>
got too hot, and a large group walked away.  {This info based upon my recall<br>
of a sermon by my then pastor, Bill Bassham, in late '87/early '88.}<br>

<i>&gt; That depends on whether one chooses to consider the New Testament as</i><br>
<i>&gt; "scripture", or not.  One could also apply the same logic to many references</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Psalms to the "word of God".  Back then, even the Old Testament was</i><br>
<i>&gt; incomplete.  I interpret Paul's words to mean that whatever "ALL SCRIPTURE"</i><br>
<i>&gt; consists of, in any given generation, is what Paul ultimately had reference</i><br>
<i>&gt; to.  The question is, has God added to "scripture" since the first century</i><br>
<i>&gt; AD?  My opinion is "NO".</i><br>
<p>
But at least you do recognize the fact that "scripture" is not used by Paul<br>
to refer to a static body of written revelation. Sure, you can take the<br>
stance that it is God, rather than Paul, who wrote the letter to Timothy,<br>
and that God himself _was_ referring to what we know as the Bible. But I think <br>
this method of exegesis runs against what the New Testament writers had to say <br>
on the matter. (Holy Spirit breathed, clay pots, etc. etc.)<br>
<p>
As for applying the same logic to the Psalms, indeed I do just that. Time and <br>
time again in the Bible we see writers referring to what they know as the<br>
scriptures. What David was thinking of and what Paul was thinking of were two<br>
different literal collections of work, although as you say they were both<br>
referring to the same general concept, that being whatever ALL SCRIPTURE<br>
consists of in any given generation.<br>
<p>
The question is, would either David or Paul have been happy with the notion <br>
that what they were writing would _become_ scripture? This question probably <br>
cannot be answered satisfactorily. But I would hazard a guess that neither of<br>
them would have expected their work to be included the way it was.<br>
<p>
What I find interesting is that when Paul said what he said to Timothy, he<br>
made the statement that _what_he_knew_as_scripture_ was both necessary  _and_<br>
_sufficient_ for the Christian. (Well, that's how you interpreted the passage,<br>
right?) Nowadays we say the same thing, except that we have added a whole lot<br>
more to the scripture of Paul's time. Considering the fact that Peter and Paul<br>
tended to disagree on certain things, I wonder how each would have felt about<br>
them both being included in scripture?<br>
<p>
Do I advocate adding any modern prophets' work to the scripture?<br>
By no means! :-)  However there are more similarities here than some would<br>
care to admit. <br>
<p>
In conclusion, the bottom line to me is that if the Law, the Writings and<br>
the Prophets were enough for Paul, and to that we have already added the<br>
gospels, apostolic writings and so on, then why alienate ourselves from the<br>
rest of the Christian world by acting as if we have an expanded canon.<br>

Well, at our board meeting last night we had quite a long discussion<br>
and many points were raised, but fortunately someone had brought along<br>
a list of the requirements of pastors that the conference normally expects.<br>
On reading through it we found it to be a rather complete list, covering <br>
spiritual life of the pastor, family life, professional growth, ethics,<br>
and many other things.  We found that most of the traits we came up with on <br>
our own as desirable (or undesirable) in a pastor, were covered by <br>
that list.<br>
<p>
We realize, however, that no pastor can fulfill all those traits perfectly.<br>
So we voted to have each member take the list home, and find the ten <br>
qualities on that list most important, and rank them from one to ten,<br>
with the opportunity also to add up to two extra ones that weren't on <br>
the list.  Then we will tally our responses, and from the ten most popular<br>
questions we will frame our interview questions.  We are scheduled to <br>
meet with the conference leadership in two weeks and present our idea of <br>
what we want to them and they will present some ideas of people they think<br>
might be appropriate to fill the position.<br>

{With apologies to T.J. Mostert, pres, Pacific Union Conf, for "stealing" some<br>
of his ideas; but, hey!, he admits he "stole" ideas from R.A. Clifton.}<br>
<p>
The First Jerusalem SDA Church needed a new pastor and so they formed a<br>
search committee.  After much investigation and not a little expense,<br>
they presented their report to the church board.<br>
<p>
1)  Re: Pastor Elijah:<br>
    Pro: Zealous for God; revivalist.<br>
    Con: Confrontational with non-SDAs; over zealous; his revivals focus too<br>
	much on "reform"; it is alleged he suffered from depression at one<br>
	time; we suspect the praise from his members is overdone, meaning<br>
	that they'd like to get rid of him.<br>
    Conclusion:  Not recommended.<br>
<p>
2)  Re: Pastor Elisha:<br>
    Pro: Has helped set up church schools; travels to visit members.<br>
    Con: Seems he had the nerve to rebuke a group of children over some<br>
	perceived problem; parents are concerned that self-image of children<br>
	has been bruised and that they'll turn away from the church.<br>
    Conclusion:  Not recommended.<br>
<p>
3)  Re: Pastor Paul:<br>
    Pro: Good rapport with ethnic groups; evangelism-oriented, Seminary PhD.<br>
    Con: Away from the pulpit too much .. evidently does not understand that<br>
	a pastor's place is in the pulpit; has had a brush or two with gov't<br>
	authorities and ended up in jail .. this could seriously damage<br>
	our image in the community.<br>
    Conclusion:  Not recommended.<br>
<p>
4)  Re: Pastor Peter:<br>
    Pro: 3,000 baptized after one series of meetings.<br>
    Con: Some members say he never got around to visiting them; lots of<br>
	baptisms will mean an expensive church building program, which our<br>
	members are not prepared to support; sometimes hasty of speech and<br>
	decision making.<br>
    Conclusion:  Not recommended.<br>
<p>
5)  Re: Pastor Nehemiah:<br>
    Pro: Successfully organized major church rebuilding program.<br>
    Con: Far too confrontational with members over alleged Sabbath breaking,<br>
	marrying out of the church, etc.<br>
    Conclusion:  Not recommended.<br>
<p>
6)  Re: Pastor Nathan:<br>
    Pro: Friends with national, political leaders.<br>
    Con: Rebuked a church member for alleged morals problem; too "down home".<br>
    Conclusion:  Not recommended.<br>
<p>
7)  Re: Pastor Moses:<br>
    Pro: Degrees in several disciplines, good leadership skills both before<br>
	and after he became a pastor; can preach w/o notes.<br>
    Con: At 80+, far too old; not eloquent, hard to listen to when speaking.<br>
    Conclusion:  Not recommended.<br>
<p>
8)  Re: Pastor Jean Baptiste:<br>
    Pro: Revivalist, gets baptisms.<br>
    Con: His messages focus too much on repentance of Jesus soon coming;<br>
	needs to focus on love, grace, and relationships.<br>
    Conclusion:  Not recommended.<br>
<p>
8)  Re: Pastor Tinkling Cymbal:<br>
    Pro: Eloquent, young; members feel real comfortable with his sermons.<br>
    Con: None that we can think of.<br>
    Conclusion:  Ask the conference to extend an urgent call to him ASAP.<br>

Bill Sands asks some _very_ good questions,<br>
especially the following:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Who sets the rule? ANd what do we do if we disagree?</i><br>
<p>
And yes, Bill, it *is* much more complex than simply<br>
sola scriptura!<br>
<p>
My relation to the Bible has changed, since reading<br>
some parallel scripture texts of various "same" events.<br>
Passages like 2 Sam 24 and 1 Chronicles 21 ("Who done<br>
it", and more); and Matt 26:34/Luke 22:34; John 13:38<br>
vs. Mark 14:30.  In part my lying lips inquiry from a while<br>
back is because of my praying and questioning the Bible<br>
to explain what it "is" and how I can better understand it's<br>
role and purpose.<br>
<p>
I hope we can get pass the pat statements, into real<br>
discussion and learning here.<br>
<p>
In Jesus,<br>
Marcus<br>

Tonight the church board of Elmhurst meets to determine the qualities<br>
we would like to have in our next pastor.  This is the list that I'm <br>
taking to the meeting, I will post a summary of what we decide after the meeting.<br>
<p>
<p>
Qualities desirable in a new pastor:                                       <br>
                                                                           <br>
Good people skills--&gt; ability to listen to people and convey               <br>
to them that he is concerned about their problems.  Training in            <br>
conflict resolution preferred.                                             <br>
                                                                           <br>
Good administrator--&gt; facilitates meetings well, sees problems and         <br>
helps them get fixed.                                                      <br>
                                                                           <br>
Gets along good with young people OR knows how to equip other people       <br>
in the church with that skill.                                             <br>
                                                                           <br>
Ability to recognize and continue the role of Elmhurst as a safe place     <br>
for those in relationship problems.                                        <br>
                                                                           <br>
Not afraid to try new techniques as part of overall vision for the future. <br>

Fred's list of requirements for a new pastor seem to be<br>
a very good afternoon joke! But boy, the list is so deep<br>
that we can easily see ourselves in it, rejecting what<br>
God would rather give us!<br>
.....may be we are "these people who want to hear things<br>
they like..."<br>
Have a good day everyone<br>

When SDAs start to abandon the 2300 days, I wonder how much<br>
they know about the earthly sanctuary, the heavenly sanctuary,<br>
the book of Hebrews, the day of atonement, the work of the<br>
earthly high priest and the work of the Heavenly High Priest!<br>
<p>
Here we have a straw man dilemma. A false all or nothing argument.<br>
<p>
Take the time to study the related items...<br>
<p>
The high priest went into the most holy place no fewer than<br>
five times in the earthly sanctuary.<br>
<p>
The throne of God has wheels on it...see Daniel!<br>
<p>
The earthly sanctuary is somehow a model in miniature of the<br>
heavenly...see The Torah for a myriad of details about<br>
the sanctuary, the tribes given the role of transporting<br>
the furniture and hardware.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; The ongoing discussion about who is eating what could benefit by asking:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Who ever said that mushrooms were okay to eat?</i><br>
<p>
Or manufactured soy bean products, for that matter. &lt;g&gt; The bottom line is<br>
a question about the "default case" in scripture.  Are things NOT explicitly<br>
mentioned in Scripture acceptable or unacceptable, by default?  One side<br>
might ask, "Where does the Bible AUTHORIZE that?" while the other side<br>
could ask "Where does the Bible FORBID it"?<br>
<p>
A good example of that line of reasoning is the spectrum of opinion over<br>
music in the church.  The Church of Christ avoids instrumental music in<br>
church because there is no EXPLICIT New Testament "precedent" for it.  On the<br>
other extreme, some churches allow and even encourage the performance of<br>
"heavy metal music" in the church, ostensibly for purposes of evangelism<br>
and/or entertainment.<br>
<p>
To that could be added just about every technological innovation since the<br>
first century, including electric lights, public address systems, and<br>
clothing made from synthetic fibers.  In the continuum from liberty to<br>
legalism, absent any clear scriptural mandate, I tend to prefer the<br>
"liberty" side, applied with God-given common sense.<br>
<p>
On what basis would/should mushrooms be banned?  Or should they?  One might<br>
consider the origins of penicillin before answering, since it was derived<br>
from a FUNGUS as well.  You sure do ask some thought-provoking questions,<br>

Let's see.  I don't have it in front of me, but Fred Christianson,<br>
Cori Bradford, Bruce Holms, Anne Anderson, and Benjamin Magapani ??<br>
I don't know about the spelling of his last name, were in the review.  <br>
Benjamin's picture<br>
was not present, but the others were.  I believe I got the names<br>
right, they are from memory.  It was also interesting to see Harvey in<br>
the Focus, dressed as James White.  Is that a real beard, Harvey?<br>

Some of our board members have suggested that the idea of <br>
alt.religion.sda as a newsgroup name conveys that we are an alternative <br>
religion.  Another possibility might be alt.religion.christian.sda since there<br>
already is an alt.religion.christian.  What do you folks think of this?<br>
<p>
It's important to note that whatever happens to the newsgroup the mailing <br>
list end of SDAnet will continue<br>
.  I am not sure if distribution under the bit.listserv hiearchy<br>
might also suit our purposes.  I have set it up as internet.listserv.sdanet<br>
at Carnegie Mellon, but if it takes a request at every news site to do that <br>
it would not suit our purposes well.<br>

Very nice, Fred... And what have I gleaned from this story?<br>
<p>
* Prophets don't necessarily make good pastors.<br>
* Don't hire an evangelist if you want a shepherd.<br>
* Even the greatest pastor can't be everything. (Fortunately he shouldn't<br>
  have to be - the church is packed full of Christians all burning with<br>
  the desire to carry on the Lord's mission, right?)<br>
<p>
<p>
By the way, I remember someone asking whether people ever really believed<br>
that the Conference staffing committees were the voice of God. As far as<br>
I can tell, some certainly did believe it, and some still do. I can <br>
remember my own father saying that it wasn't until he himself sat on some<br>
of these kinds of committees that he started to wonder just how indelible<br>
their pronouncements were.<br>

Has it reached the point where each church gets to<br>
<p>
choose who they want as a pastor???<br>
<p>
I don't understand, but I thought pastors serve where<br>
<p>
the Spirit leads them, not where they are wanted. Please,<br>
<p>
somebody, enlighten me!<br>

Benjamin Siyowi Mapani said regarding the Reformed SDAs:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; also because of our dress(dont laugh please). A friend of mine</i><br>
<i>&gt; attended their camp meeting this year, and on one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; days his wife was dressed in pair of trousers, and at that</i><br>
<i>&gt; he was told that "they have counsel on how to dress" so</i><br>
<i>&gt; that his wife could "improve her dressing standards". Ofcourse</i><br>
<i>&gt; the "elders" there showed him all the counsel by EGW and how</i><br>
<i>&gt; to dress in a pair of trousers. They are pretty serious on</i><br>
<i>&gt; dressing standards.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, there are some who believe its not right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; drive on Sabbath, so they walk to church.</i><br>
<p>
	Hmmm. Do I laugh or cry?<br>
<p>
	I'm reminded of Paul's missionary journeys to the Gentiles. He <br>
went to them and told them of Jesus. Many were saved and small communities <br>
of believers were established to live among their towns &amp; demonstrate the<br>
love of Christ to those around them.<br>
	A few concerned people did their own missionary journey behind Paul <br>
and told those communities that they should be circumcized and keep the<br>
Jewish days/feasts etc.<br>
	Paul was not pleased. He told the Gentile believers that if they<br>
were circumcized they would no longer be saved. He told the Jews to stop<br>
making it difficult for the Gentiles to accept Christ.<br>
<p>
	I wonder if I see comparison with such groups as those mentioned<br>
by Ben above and their specific laws and codes.<br>
	In fact I even wonder if the mainstream SDA church is guilty of<br>
some of this - and I'd appreciate your thoughts on this issue.<br>
	When we take a non-Christian and make him/her a SDA, are we not<br>
fettering them with the Sabbath/vegetarianism/other culturally based<br>
behaviours? This "life style" may be a blessing to us just as the Jews<br>
found their identity &amp; fulfillment in their days &amp; laws. To the new<br>
Gentile Christians though, they would so easily lose their freedom in God<br>
by becoming enslaved to these same days/laws (which to them were not<br>
familiar). How many new SDAs become enslaved to our days/laws? I'm finding<br>
this a very disturbing thought.<br>
<p>
Some ideas?<br>

Bill, you are right here, in implying that when "only it<br>
was required" the high priest went into the MHP.<br>
<p>
There is nothing wrong with 2300 days, nothing wrong with<br>
1844. The problem Adventists have when questioned on this<br>
issue stems from the fact that "they do not understand the<br>
subject themselves that well".<br>
<p>
In antiquity, before there was a sinner, how did the heavenly<br>
temple (sanctuary) function? After Lucifer fell what happened?<br>
<p>
Interesting enough I was aimlessly reading EW and on page 89 or<br>
82, I read the statement that angels have "golden cards(like<br>
your mastercard!!)" which they show to other angels when going<br>
out and in! Now why would such a system be required, going out<br>
and in the gates of heaven, every angel flashes his golden card!<br>
<p>
Then again in Story of redemption, (cant remember the page now)<br>
it says Satan was allowed in heaven as much as  desired (cf Job 1).<br>
Was the golden card system a new one after the cross or not?<br>
<p>
I believe we can harmonise these questions by studying studiously<br>
the book of Hebrews and the related passages in all scripture<br>
especially the Psalms and the five books of Moses.<br>
<p>
There was a change in ministry somewhere along the way.<br>
And melchizedek, the priest of the Most High God, in which<br>
temple was he ministering, since he is a priest who lives<br>
forever...<br>
Have a good day everyone<br>
Ben<br>

<p>
This is a case of the "exception proving the rule", though.  If it's high<br>
today, DESPITE modern techniques, think what the "contamination" was back in<br>
the relative primitive conditions right after the flood when God first<br>
gave man meat to eat.  God obviously knew what the conditions were then, and<br>
what they would be today, and took them into account before saying what He<br>
did.  IOW, we at least KNOW HOW to make food safer today, regardless of how<br>
consistently those concepts are applied.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It seems that many preparers of such food hold the attitude, out of sight </i><br>

<i>&gt; food items in places that made the environment for bacterial growth highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; favorable.  Warm, moist and behind glass.</i><br>
<p>
This is, of course, an argument for proper preparation and storage.  It's<br>
like showing pictures of fatal car wrecks.  One can either respond to them<br>
by learning how to drive more safely, or else give up his/her automobile<br>
altogether. I'll opt for the former.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We still take our chances every bit as much now as back in those days.</i><br>
<p>
That being the case, then the "grounds" for God's decision in Genesis 9 are<br>
every bit as valid (or invalid) as they were when He first communicated it<br>
to Noah and his descendants.  You're right -- modern technology is not a<br>
substitute for common sense.  Hopefully no one is suggesting it is.  But to<br>
a person who HAS and USES his common sense, technology can be a useful tool.<br>
<p>
My point being, when God gives me a gift, I'll gladly "take my chances" on<br>
His wisdom. <br>

Dave brings up an interesting question, that we of course can't know<br>
the answer to.  Was there a need for plants to have chemical defenses in<br>
Eden?  Presumably the entire creation was vegetarian.  Death had not<br>
happened before the fall, so it is likely that animals did not kill<br>
other animals. (open can of worms here..).  Did insects kill plants like<br>
they do now?  Once again I think the answer would be no.  If so, then<br>
why would a plant need a chemical defense as powerful as nicotine?  More<br>
to the point, would the production of nicotine be a micro evolutionary<br>
trait, or a created trait?  (worms starting to crawl out of can).  Why<br>
would cats have the carnivorous dentation that the have?<br>
<p>
Now these questions are not essential to salvation, they are more on<br>
the order of "how many angels can dance on the head of a pin", but<br>
they are interesting never the less.<br>
<p>
Cheers<br>

Raylene asked&gt;&gt;How many SDAs become enslaved to our days/laws? i'm<br>
		finding this a very disturbing thought.&lt;&lt;<br>
<p>
I dont know the figure, but many would be near that. We forget that<br>
the law is no use to one who is dead... its function is simply<br>
to preserve whatever life is there (spiritual and physical). I can<br>
relate well to this because I was also enslaved in this type of<br>
donts and dos until I discovered the word GRACE!<br>
<p>
Only when people learn the true gospel, then they can start<br>
understanding the value of the law.  A good example is the<br>
question "what can you and cant you do on the sabbath?"<br>
You can easily have a list of rules, and have complex ifs<br>
and only if and so forth. A person who has appreciated the<br>
sabbath on the other hand will always look forward to the<br>
day with such a thirst that the day will be so short...to<br>
him/her it will be important to gather those blessings<br>
promised on this day than worry about when sunset will occur!<br>
He would rather have a whole year of sabbath...<br>
<p>
In short I find our friends the Reformed SDAs to be<br>
pursuing a very works-related type of life. Especially<br>
with EGW, when one can see know intellectually the fruits,<br>
its tempting to do it yourself and not by faith...<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; Interesting enough I was aimlessly reading EW and on page 89 or</i><br>

<p>
The correct reference is EW 37, 39.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then again in Story of redemption, (cant remember the page now)</i><br>

<i>&gt; Was the golden card system a new one after the cross or not?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure, but I think Ben may be referring to the following passage:<br>
<p>
  "Satan would invent means to annoy the heavenly angels and show<br>
   contempt for His authority.  As he could not gain admission<br>
   within the gates of heaven, he would wait just at the entrance,<br>
   to taunt the angels and seek contention with them as they went<br>
   in and out."  (SR 27)<br>
<p>
This passage appears to contradict, or at least modify, Ben's assertion,<br>
however.  I see no contradiction between the passage in SR and the ones<br>
in EW.<br>

Such as will they be getting all the alt.* groups or only the big<br>

didn't carry it.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; please let me know.  In none of my existing accounts do I have any </i><br>
<i>&gt; privilege to create such a group.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I may be able to help here.  My home machine, bellman.apana.org.au, is<br>
Usenet-connected.  It isn't Internet connected, as it uses a dial-up<br>
UUCP link, but that shouldn't be the main barrier.  The biggest likely<br>
problem is that it is connected via a public access network that is<br>
run on a fairly amateur basis, so the propagation of a newgroup<br>
message from my site may not be very good.<br>
<p>
Actually, the way I read the various FAQs, anyone with posting<br>
privileges should be able to create a newsgroup.  You just post an<br>
appropriate message to the 'control' newsgroup.  Of course, being a<br>
news admin yourself probably helps.  Failing that, if your local news<br>
admin doesn't want to carry the group, it won't get very far.<br>
<p>
Have the various SDA institutions connected to the net refused to<br>
create such a group, or are you just assuming they wouldn't want to<br>
because they are supporting compuserve, or do they not get alt.*<br>
groups?  You've managed to get a domain name (sdanet.org), I would<br>
have thought it was _easier_ to create a newsgroup.<br>
<p>
Regarding the naming of the group.  I grepped my .newsrc for<br>
alt.religion and this is what turned up:<br>
<p>
alt.religion.buddhism.tibetan<br>
alt.religion.gnostic<br>
alt.religion.mormon <br>
alt.religion.zoroastrianism<br>
alt.religion.christian<br>
alt.religion.eckankar <br>
alt.religion.islam<br>
alt.religion.monica<br>
alt.religion.sabaean<br>
alt.religion.santaism<br>
alt.religion.sexuality<br>
alt.religion.computers<br>
alt.religion.adm3a<br>
alt.religion.kibology<br>
alt.religion.all-worlds<br>
alt.religion.emacs<br>
alt.religion.scientology<br>
<p>
There seems to be nearly as many 'joke' groups in here as serious<br>
ones.  Have you considered positioning the group under<br>
alt.religion.christian, or are you happy having it on the same<br>
hierarchical level as this and all the others?<br>
<p>
It is technically possible for me to do this, as my home machine,<br>
<p>
<p>
Finally, mail-news gateways.  I've done this on bellman for a mailing<br>
list which I wanted to read locally using my newsreading software and<br>
it worked fine.  I did it by setting up a mail alias which mungs the<br>
headers a bit and calls inews, which posts the article.  As far as I<br>
know, this is basically how it is normally done, though perhaps the<br>
munging script is usually more foolproof.  <br>
<p>
I made it work the other way by making the group moderated and setting<br>
the forwarding address for the moderator to the list address, which is<br>
a fairly cheap and nasty way to do it, but since the group only<br>
existed at one site, it worked OK.<br>
<p>
My impression is it should be possible to operate a gateway without<br>
root privileges, it just makes it easier if you have them.  <br>
<p>
While in theory I could operate a gateway for you, this wouldn't be a<br>
good idea because bellman has a very slow turn-around time due to the<br>
UUCP link, and my provider probably wouldn't be too happy with all<br>
that traffic going twice across our part of the Net.  I'm more than<br>
happy to help find out technical details for you, though.<br>
<p>
<p>
best regards,<br>
<p>

Now that abortion has come up as a topic I wish to talk about the following<br>
hypothetical and get your thoughts on it.<br>
<p>
It has been stated that about 50% of a childs behavioural characteristics<br>
are gained genetically through the parents.  It also appears that these <br>
characteristics stay with them throughout their life.  This suggests then <br>
that if a child comes from a home where the father/mother is alcoholic the <br>
chances are high that the child will also have a weakness towards alcohol <br>
even if they never touch the stuff their whole life.<br>
<p>
Let us now consider the case of the poor lady who falls pregnant to a <br>
rapist.  On the basis of the above if the baby is a boy then that boy will <br>
possibly have the same tendency as the father.  So this boy reaches teen <br>
years or more and rapes another girl himself.  Which then is the greater <br>
sin?  Is it to have an abortion in the first place thereby preventing this <br>
problem or should the pregnancy be allowed to go ahead in the full knowledge <br>
that coming from a rapist that this is going to significantly increase the <br>
chances that the person will grow up and commit the same crime as his sire?<br>
<p>
My belief is that abortion is worth while in the case of rape or the <br>
mother's health is in danger.<br>
<p>
My own boys were brought out six weeks early because of the problem with my <br>
wife's health so in a sense it was an abortion if you please but at least I <br>
have two boys now who turn one year old on August nineteen.  We were <br>
fortunate enough to have the best of both worlds, an abortion(ceasarian) and <br>
two wonderful boys.<br>

It most definitely does qualify Dan.<br>
<p>
This is the question being discussed, how much and at<br>
what time is "all scripture" ALL scripture?  Especially if<br>
some manuscripts say something and others say<br>
another.<br>
<p>
Further, the knowledge we know now was not there<br>
when the writer(s) of 2 Sam/1 Corinthians disagreed<br>
on the "who done it" and the other disagreeing points<br>
in that story (ie. how many = 800,000/1,100,000;<br>
500,000/400,000) to name one.  Is every single word<br>
inspired?  What's going on?  Is "God breathing" differing<br>
things out of opposite sides of His mouth?<br>
<p>
Furthermore, *who* is the SDA commentary if we're a<br>
"The Bible and the Bible only" people?  Get with it folks.<br>

<i>&gt; I have been wondering at what stage of fetal development is abortion sin?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do we have a theological basis for our stand?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am a new comer to internet and have been out of circulation for a few </i><br>
<i>&gt; weeks.  I have been trying to get onto internet from home but it seemed </i><br>
<i>&gt; that nothing I did could get me on.  Well last night a friend dropped in </i><br>
<i>&gt; and looked through the process I have been following and could not find </i><br>
<i>&gt; anything wrong.  He finally identified the error to be in the telephone </i><br>
<i>&gt; jack--the jack was connected to the wrong elements.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am glad to be back and look forward to your comments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; God bless, Emil  </i><br>

Fred asked whether the people I termed "The SDA reform" are the<br>
same as the "Reformed Seventh-Day Adventist Church".<br>
<p>
The answer is yes, may be I should have written it as it is<br>
commonly written. Sorry for misleading you!<br>
Have a good day.<br>

<i>&gt; Has it reached the point where each church gets to</i><br>
<i>&gt; choose who they want as a pastor???</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't understand, but I thought pastors serve where</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Spirit leads them, not where they are wanted. Please,</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody, enlighten me!</i><br>
<p>
We _hope_ that the Spirit will lead a pastor to somewhere they<br>
are wanted, or at least to somewhere where they can be <br>
effective. The idea of a local church based "search committee"<br>
is no less an opportunity for the Spirit to lead than any other<br>
kind of God-fearing committee.<br>
<p>
If the Spirit can only lead through mystic means or through<br>
institutions, than perhaps your requests for enlightenment<br>
would be better saved for prayer meetings?? :-)<br>

Clay was unaware that there are some opinions around that say that<br>
God's throne is mobile and moves from Holy Place to Most Holy Place.<br>
The idea originates in Daniel, and Ellen White describes this I belieive<br>
in Early Writings in the chapter on the 2300 days.<br>
<p>
It is obviously a metaphor because we are discussing a spiritual<br>
concept in a material or physical 3 dimensional way.<br>
<p>
We know so little about the earthly or heavenly sanctuaries<br>
that we must be careful when we express the idea that it is<br>
simply not possible. Spiritual things are spiritually understood.<br>
<p>
Yes, Clay, I believe that the throne of God is mobile. I do find<br>
a bit of a problem with the Bible texts which speak of God as<br>
a being which doesnot cast a shadow...a shadow of turning<br>
as one text says.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I just happen to have a copy of Adventist Today with me today.  <br>
<p>
 From their masthead: "Adventist Today reports on contemporary issues of <br>
importance to Adventist church members.  Following basic principles of <br>
ethics and canons of journalism, this publication strives for fairness, <br>
candor and good taste."    <br>
<p>
I am a charter subscriber and believe that they are achieving their goal.<br>
The current issue is on "Where is Adventist higher education headed?" The<br>
next issue should be verying interesting - Short-term Creationists and<br>
Long-term Creationists. <br>
<p>
It is published bimonthly. Annual subscription, $18 individuals, $12 <br>
students, Add $10 for addresses outside of North America.<br>
<p>
Address: Adventist Today, P.O. Box 1220, Loma Linda, CA 92354-1220<br>
         Voice (909) 824-2780, Fax (909) 824-3880<br>
<p>
Editor: Raymond Cottrell<br>
<p>
I find the articles very well written, it along with Sprecturm published<br>
by Adventest Forum help me spiritually and intellectual.  As the say here <br>
in the Big Easy it gets 5 beans. ( In New Orelans, everything revolves <br>
around food) <br>

<i>&gt; The question is when the fetus becomes a human being. If you check</i><br>

<i>&gt; that when the spirit enters the body, the fetus becomes a person,</i><br>
<i>&gt; theologically speaking.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, I can't condemn others as evil for thinking that the fetus </i><br>
<i>&gt; becomes a person at a much later date. Actually, I hope they're right.</i><br>
<p>
Clay, I have a question. Would the "spirit" you refer to be a "soul?" Or <br>
is it breath?<br>

I may be a little out of place mentioning this, however;<br>
<p>
In my previous response to this post by Sean Carney, I neglected to also <br>
mention that ASDAL (The Association of Seventh-day Adventist Librarians)<br>
has set up a standing committee who is in the process of investigating<br>
various ways in which to make larger amounts of information and commercially<br>
available databases (both tape load and CD-ROM based) more widely accessible<br>
to all the academic environments at a reduced cost per campus, and other<br>
avenues of increased networking and provision of information access via<br>
the internet, etc.  I am one of five who are serving on that committee.<br>
Harvey Brenneise at Andrews, Gilbert Abella at La Sierra, Joel Lutes at<br>
Pacific Union and Peg Bennet at Southern are the other four.<br>

<i>&gt;Fred asked whether the people I termed "The SDA reform" are the</i><br>
<i>&gt;same as the "Reformed Seventh-Day Adventist Church".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The answer is yes, may be I should have written it as it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;commonly written. Sorry for misleading you!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Have a good day.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ben</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
That is not true.  I grew up in the SDA Reform Movement.  I was impressed by th<br>
e accurate description Ben gave of what the Reform Movement represents, but I n<br>
ever heard Reformed SDA Church as a descriptive term for the SDA Reform Movemen<br>
t.<br>
<p>
Just in case there is still some interest in finding out about the Reform Movem<br>
ent, I can share some of what I know abou them.<br>
<p>
It started in Europe in 1914, during WWI, when the GC lost communication with t<br>
he European Division.  The president of the Division, in a miscalculated decisi<br>
on, ordered the brethren to bear arms.  A small group, unhappy about the decisi<br>
on separated from the church and hence the Reform Movement was born.  When the<br>
communication channels were open again, there were some efforts made to concili<br>
ate the differences, but by then, apparently it was too late.  Other issues wer<br>
e introduced such as diet, dress codes, 1888, and a justification of the existe<br>
nce of the SDA Reform Movement by saying that it represented the fourth angel o<br>
f Revelation.<br>
<p>
Over the years the movement grew considerably in certain parts of the world, pa<br>
rticularly in South America, where most of the members of the church are locate<br>
d today.  In 1951, there was a schism in the movement, due to a power struggle<br>
for the presidency.  Since then there were two main SDA Reform Movement churche<br>
s, both claiming to be the original 1914 movement and accusing the other of bei<br>
ng the 1951 "apostate" offshoot.  One group, kept most of the members in Europe<br>
, particularly Germany, while the other kept mainly the members from South Amer<br>
ica, especially Brazil.<br>
<p>
The main leaders of each were Kozel (leading the predominantly german members)<br>
and the other was Nicolici.  Through the years they constantly fought and bicke<br>
red over properties, accused each other of the most heinous things, and for a w<br>
hile in the last few years, seemed to be overcoming their differences and were<br>
about to reunite.  I do not know, at the present time, what the status of that<br>
is.<br>
<p>
Anyway, many other offshoots from these appeared over the years.  Their main so<br>
urce of members, as was pointed out by someone, are unhappy SDA members.  For m<br>
any years they were aggressive attackers of the SDA church and active recruiter<br>
s.  In Brazil (where I am from) I witnessed many long debates between reformers<br>
 and members of the Big Church, also known for a long time as Babylon (the SDA<br>
church).<br>
<p>
Circa 1970, there was a tremendous shake up in the Reform Church.  Initially a<br>
small group (among them my family members), tired of bickering, accusations, an<br>
d a controlling environment, left the Reform church.  It was not easy.  Leaving<br>
 a family like society where everyone is known by name, to join what for years<br>
was the apostate church (SDA), the Big Church, where we became just unknown mem<br>
bers.  We lost all our friends.  It took us many years to recover from the trau<br>
ma.  Many more left afterwards.  Today, I still know many people there.  Their<br>
world headquarters of the '51 group I belonged is now in Roanoke, VA.  I know m<br>
any of their leaders.  Unfortunately, the adverse attitude towards the SDA Chur<br>
ch has never changed.  I believe it never will.  Many are sympathetic towards t<br>
he good things it does, but for them, it is better that a family member goes to<br>
 the "world" than to join the Big Church.<br>
<p>
Some people have made attempts to overcome their aversion to rejoining the Chur<br>
ch.  The late Elder Pierson, to his death, worked quietly with the reformers, p<br>
articularly because of the geographic proximity to their biggest church in Amer<br>
ica - Sacramento, CA.  He was an appreciated person by their leadership.<br>
<p>
There are many things I could still share, but I feel this has gone long enough<br>
..  If there are any questions you could answer about that, please contact me by<br>
 E-mail.<br>

Well here is a response to the question - this response is<br>
undoubtedly 100% truth, but unfortunately it's not a whole<br>
lot of use.<br>
<p>
Yes, _all_ abortion is sin, in the same sense that all illness,<br>
sadness, pain and death is sin. Without the presence of that<br>
malady we call sin there would be none of the above. I do not<br>
personally know _any_ Christians that are not opposed to<br>
abortion. Even those that favour the pro-choice line are still<br>
very opposed to it. Unfortunately in this bad old world, though,<br>
we are often faced with the choice between a range of awful<br>
things, with no good in sight.<br>

Benjamin has touched one of my favorite passages from Early Writings<br>
in which Ellen White talks about the golden card which each angel<br>
has and uses to get into heaven!<br>
<p>
Is there anything at all in the Bible which might correlate or<br>
substantiate this idea which seems only to come from Ellen White?<br>
<p>
Just imagine! An entry system in which access is by an angel's gold card?<br>
<p>
Master Card eat your heart out!!! 8-)<br>

I am furious.  I was standing in the checkout line, and happened to<br>
glance over at one of the tabloid rags, with the title "50 foot Jesus<br>
visits UN" or something similar.  It went on how a tourist snapped<br>
this picture that was going to rock the world.  I did not pay it to much<br>
attention, until my wife pointed out that it was the Harry Anderson painting<br>
of Jesus knocking on the UN building.  I was outraged.  Who ever owns the<br>
copyright on that one, should sue the pants off the magazine.  Boy, that<br>
chaps me!<br>
Cheers<br>

I don't know, Clay.  It would go a way toward explaining those wheels in<br>
wheels in Ezekiel.  It's a better explanation than attributing it to bad<br>

As for the "humor" of "this image," it's not an argument I'd ever care<br>
to make to my sister-in-law, who is the head of Disabled Student<br>
Services at a university in Chicago and is herself confined to a<br>

nv&gt;&gt;If one is concerned about obeying the Levitical dietary regulations, then<br>
nv&gt;&gt;worms in apples (especially when inadvertantly eaten alive) should be<br>
nv&gt;&gt;considered at least as important as the dead ones in cooked fish.  I'm not<br>
nv&gt;&gt;aware of any documented research on the hazards of either one, though.<br>

"What we eat - we are"<br>
At least the apple worm is wriggling apple, while the fish worm is <br>
wriggling fish.<br>
I have an aversion to fish - even before I became vegetarian, <br>
therefore I would prefer the apple worm.<br>
<p>
A good day to you all.<br>

<p>
I'd prefer NEITHER kind of worm, as a matter of fact.  Your logic is a<br>
little hard to follow.  You say you'd prefer to eat an "apple worm" because<br>
you like apples.  Do you like corn, too?  Would you therefore eat the beef<br>
from a corn-fed cow?<br>
<p>
The fact is, a cow is a Biblically "clean" animal and a worm, either in a<br>
fish or in an apple, isn't.  I'm told that lipstick is, or at used to be,<br>
made from worms.  I wonder which kind of worms are used?  Personally, I don't<br>
wear lipstick, so I don't worry about it too much. &lt;g&gt;<br>
<p>
As for your "aversion to fish", just be glad you weren't around when Jesus<br>
fed fish to over 5,000 hungry people.  It might be a tad bit embarrasing to<br>
refuse something that God Himself had prepared for you.  Nevertheless,<br>
that's your prerogative.<br>

Sorry to take so long getting back to you and Ben, but I had to<br>
leave on a business trip last week and just got back.  Please give<br>
me a few more days to compose a post on Christ in the MHP, and<br>
we'll get the ball rolling.<br>

The passing of Dr. Hasel in a car crash causes a great sadness<br>
for Adventists. As one who studied for classes taught by <br>
Dr. Hasel, I believe that the Seventh-day Adventist church<br>
has lost a great scholar and thinker.<br>
<p>
This is truly a sad day for Seventh-day Adventism. The whole<br>
Hasel family and Dr. Hasel's "student family" are in our<br>
prayers.<br>

Dear all<br>
<p>
I also have concern for the people who will suffer for ever. To mention,<br>
however, that God is LOVE (which is very true) is to refer to only one<br>
characteristic. He is also just, holy, etc.  When He said that the<br>
punishment of sin is death, He meant it, love or no love, since His<br>
righteousness demands it and He really does not have another option. And He<br>
does not really care for your opinion on that score either, viz Rom 9 : 15<br>
vv (or there abouts).<br>
<p>
I have come to understand and appreciate our Father as an absolute Being,<br>
ie either black or white, wet or dry, warm or cold - nothing in between,<br>
like it or not.<br>
<p>
In Christ<br>

<i>&gt; [This is a message on abortion.  I'll send it through, but remind</i><br>
<i>&gt; you all that abortion is officially a taboo topic on SDAnet and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; reserve the right to cut off this discussion at any time.  SCT]</i><br>
<p>
I'll tread carefully on this, Steve. Feel free not to post this if<br>
you want.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have been wondering at what stage of fetal development is abortion sin?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Do we have a theological basis for our stand?</i><br>
<p>
The question is when the fetus becomes a human being. If you check<br>
out discussions on newsgroups such as talk.abortion, most abortion<br>
proponents believe that the fetus does not become a person until it<br>
has brainwaves approaching the complexity of (born) human brainwaves.<br>
<p>
The problem with this approach is that we as Christians realize that<br>
a person is not merely a mind. We also have a spirit. We can assume<br>
that when the spirit enters the body, the fetus becomes a person,<br>
theologically speaking.<br>
<p>
When does the spirit enter the body? Or is it there at the moment the<br>
egg is fertilized? I don't think there's any way to tell. In the<br>
absence of any evidence one way or the other, I choose to err on the<br>
side of caution and oppose abortion in all instances.<br>
<p>
However, I can't condemn others as evil for thinking that the fetus <br>
becomes a person at a much later date. Actually, I hope they're right.<br>

Interestingly enough, I was flipping though the TV channels<br>
yesterday and saw a program on Public TV about Eugenics<br>
and the science of genetics.<br>
<p>
The program covered a variety of issues.  Yet particularly<br>
interesting to me was an account of a Mediterranean society<br>
in Europe that has a genetic disease that is hereditary<br>
(showing up in 1:10 of the population).  I forget the name of<br>
the disease, but the medical and religions community<br>
(at least the Catholic church _there_) support using abortion to<br>
"prevent" the continuation of the disease in society.<br>
The disease normally killed the person in childhood, now,<br>
through advanced medicine they are able to treat them<br>
but the result is a larger and larger cost to the "state" since<br>
more ill kids are living longer while new ones continue to be<br>
born, and there is no known cure.<br>
<p>
Of course I have no answers to impose on others just<br>
relaying reality that some people live in, and that I have not<br>
experienced personally - yet.<br>
<p>
What I saw was episode #104 "Conceiving the Future" in a<br>
larger series called "Medicine At The Crossroads" and is<br>
produced by WNET in (New York) and BBS - British Broadcasting<br>
Service.  It's distributed by PBS.  You can call WNET for more<br>
information: (212) 560-2000.<br>

Jayne Rop asked if it has come to the point where every church can choose<br>
their own pastor.  Well, no, not quite.  Obviously in multi-church districts<br>
which are still the majority in many North American conferences the conference<br>
has to play a more active role.  But for the larger churches, particularly<br>
those which like Elmhurst have been faithful in returning their tithes,<br>
the conferences are becoming increasingly cooperative.  In fact I think <br>
we probably have more freedom than we really need.  <br>
<p>
The conference has invited us to submit any names we may think of for<br>
consideration in the process.  So far the search committee has not <br>
come up with any.  There is a reason we have our men in the conference <br>
office, and part of that is that they know much more than we do what <br>
and who is available in the way of ministers.  In particular, Ken Denslow<br>
who is the ministerial director and church growth specialist in Illinois,<br>
was formerly the assistant director of the North American Division <br>
Evangelism Institute and so has seen many of the best young pastors in <br>
the denomination go through his supervision.  I would not be surprised<br>
if we end up settling on one of the names recommended by the conference.<br>
<p>
But before we do, past experiences of this congregation have left <br>
us with a desire to make sure that we don't repeat the same mistakes<br>
that we have made before.  No doubt with this selection there will be <br>
new and different mistakes, but that is the price to pay.<br>
<p>
I don't think that this is denying the role of the Spirit.  It's an <br>
important consensus-building exercise between the local congregation<br>
and the conference officers, one of the few contacts that we have with them.<br>
The Spirit came upon the apostles when they were all of one accord,<br>
and any opportunity we have to come into accord should be taken.<br>
Furthermore, in this mode, our church has no one to blame except ourselves<br>
if we get a pastor we don't like.<br>

Can someone please tell me which super market checkout line tabloid had<br>
the Harry Anderson picture of Christ knocking at the UN door?<br>
<p>
I am a bibliographic instruction librarian and it would be a great example<br>
of the kind of thing you may find in print that isn't based on fact. <br>
Some of our students have a real problem with this. They seem to have an<br>
even more difficult time evaluating information<br>
that they get from a computer source for content and bias.  <br>
<p>
Thanks for the help<br>

In-Reply-&gt;To: &lt;9408102143.AA08046@edmund&gt; from "SDA Net" at Aug 10, 94 05:43:00 pm<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;From: Mr Emil Gentry Fernando &lt;efernand@HK.Super.NET&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Subject: Is abortion sin?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have been wondering at what stage of fetal development is abortion sin?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do we have a theological basis for our stand?</i><br>
<p>
Here are some of the Bible texts upon which I base my position: Exo 20:13,<br>
Psa 139:13-16, Job 31:15, Deu 7:13, Psa 127:3, Isa 44:24, 49:1,5, Jer 1:5,<br>
1 Cor 6:19,20, Acts 17:28, Psa 100:3.  Since I believe it is God who forms<br>
us, I believe we can properly apply Mar 10:9 to this situation as well.<br>
<p>
I am reminded of an experience related by Mark Finley.  He was making some<br>
travel plans at a travel agency (while he was based in Europe).  As he and<br>
the female travel agent were chatting back and forth it came out that Mark<br>
was a Christian pastor.  The agent paused and a pained look came over her<br>
face.  In a voice that betrayed the anguish and confusion in her soul, she<br>
asked, "Do you believe it's a sin to have an abortion?"<br>
<p>
Mark tho't a moment and then asked (very wisely, IMHO), "Are you asking me<br>
because you are thinking of having an abortion? Or because you have had an<br>
abortion?"<br>
<p>
In tears, she poured out how she had met an American businessman on extended<br>
assignment in Europe.  They started living together and sometime thereafter<br>
she found she was pregnant.  She was delighted and hoped he would marry her.<br>
He was aghast and insisted she have an abortion.  Under pressure and fear<br>
of losing him, of whom she'd grown fond, she went thru with the abortion.<br>
But now she was burdened with guilt.<br>
<p>
Mark was able to share with her God's great love for sinners (Rom 5:8), God's<br>
promises to forgive us when we repent (1 Joh 1:9), and that there is no sin<br>
so great (1 Joh 3:20) that God would turn away from the penitent (John 6:37).<br>

Hi, Friends,<br>
<p>
First, thanx to everyone for your prayers for my friend,<br>
Reds.  He is still in Fairfax Hospital.  The doctors have<br>
determined that he is having difficulties due to his<br>
diverticulitis.  Reds has not eaten solid food since Monday.<br>
He's being fed intravenously.  I spoke to him today and<br>
yesterday, and will be visiting him tonight.  He says<br>
he feels better, but he has to have pain killers in order<br>
to get real sleep.<br>
<p>
Even though he is in pain, Reds is still making jokes.<br>
We sent him a beautiful dish garden with a card that<br>
said, "Do not eat this=ADthis is not a salad!"  He got a<br>
kick out of that.<br>
<p>
I'm going to print out the responses to my prayer request<br>
and take them to the hospital with me tonight.<br>
<p>
Thanx again!<br>
<p>
God is merciful!<br>

A few more details on the Harry Anderson painting which was used on <br>
the front of the Weekly World News (which BTW is biweekly, not weekly).<br>
The headline mentioned a 500-foot Jesus.<br>
Then they used an actual photograph of the UN Building, and took <br>
the picture of Jesus from the Harry Anderson painting (which most <br>
commonly appears on the front cover of Steps To Christ) and superimposed<br>
it on the photo, reversing the image in the process.  <br>
About 1/2 hour work for Adobe Photoshop.  <br>

Discussion on abortion is something I always try to be careful about, not <br>
only because its hard to discuss rationally, but I myself often get into<br>
trouble for the things I say about it.  <br>
<p>
I recall a forum sesion in Pittsburgh with the precursor of what is now<br>
their chapter of the Association of Adventist Forums.  I was the leader at <br>
the time and had scheduled one of the health-care professionals who was a <br>
member of our church to talk about abortion and the choices that health<br>
care professionals face on this.<br>
<p>
I only found out later that we had a visitor from Indiana that day who was a <br>
member of some flavor of fundamentalist Baptist church and had been <br>
involved in Operation Rescue.  He withdrew from the discussion early on<br>
and did not cause a scene, to his credit.  But he was quite upset that<br>
some of the pro-choice views that were expressed that afternoon were <br>
expressed, and I doubt he will darken the door of an SDA church again anytime<br>
soon.<br>

The Dare to Care Camporee officially opened Tuesday evening, but Pathfinders<br>
and staff members, some traveling for days by autos, vans, busses, trains and<br>
airplanes, arrived at least a day before and turned the Bandimere Drag Strip<br>
into a temporary city.	<br>
The hastily erected Pathfinder city is located just southwest of Denver, and<br>
stretches more than a mile and among the foothills of the massive Rocky<br>
Mountains.  <br>
A huge amount of planning over a long period of time by a large staff of<br>
workers lead by Ron Whitehead, made this possible.  <br>
The awesome task of providing for 10,000 campers required an enormous staff of<br>
volunteers, who were not only willing to work without compensation, but to also<br>
pay the full fee of $95 for the Camporee.<br>
The result of their strenuous work made it possible to offer just about every<br>
type of wholesome activity for youth between the ages of ten and fifteen, has<br>
been provided at the camporee. <br>
Registration for the large influx of personnel and vehicles required special<br>
traffic control, provided by camp security, over a two-mile area.  The<br>
registration tent was flooded with Pathfinder directors receiving their official<br>
papers and the wrist bands that everyone is required to wear.  <br>
Each North American Union has an assigned location for its Pathfinder clubs.<br>
It is remarkable the way a flat piece of ground can be transformed into home for<br>
the next week. Sleeping dinning, and cooking tents are erected. Of course the<br>
club sign is raised for all to see that the "Arkansas Travelers," the "Madison<br>
Mustangs," "Pontiac Chiefs," or the "Denver Mountaineers" are present.<br>
It took 137 golf carts, 191 walkie-talkie radios,  and the help of 125 who had<br>
worked as summer staff in camps around the country to keep the operation running<br>
smoothly.  A camp radio station operates during the waking hours by qualified<br>
professionals.<br>
Eighteen 2,000 gallon water tanks supplied the 25,000 gallons of drinking water<br>
each day. Portable showers, and rest rooms are strategically located throughout<br>
the camp. Hot water is supplied from plastic bags heated by the sun.<br>
Pathfinders are showing their willingness to "Care."  A number of institutions<br>
and organizations have benefited by the volunteer service provided by<br>
Pathfinders throughout the Denver metropolitan area. They have participated in<br>
feeding the homeless programs, painting houses, removing graffiti, some office<br>
work, and packaging food in food banks. <br>
On the campground, sixteen large tents have been erected and are filled with<br>
activities that provide entertainment, instruction, and materials for the<br>
campers. Additional activities are available on the grounds, and even  more are<br>
available at locations away from the camp but available by shuttle bus.<br>
<p>
Pathfinders are interested in their health.  The Health and Lifestyle tent runs<br>
well attended programs through the day.<br>
In the handicap tent, Pathfinders are blind folded and then run an obstacle<br>
course pushing a wheel chair with an occupant directing the blinded one through<br>
the course.<br>
Thousands are getting honors in the honor tent, which provides the necessary<br>
information for honors that range from amphibians to ukelele.<br>
Each evening nearly ten thousand assemble in the Red Rock Amphitheater. The<br>
Amphitheater is beyond walking distance from the camp, so a sixty bus convoy<br>
makes two trips each way each evening.  While this massive transportation system<br>
operates, talented Pathfinders and special guest provide additional<br>
entertainment before and after the main evening program. The first night<br>
demonstrated that there is more than enough good talent among our Pathfinders.<br>

<p>
Is this the "Reformed Seventh-day Adventist Church"?  (I have a posting<br>
in the SDAnet pipeline regarding my understanding of their origins).<br>
Or does the group you refer to go by another name?<br>
<p>
I have SDA friends in California who visited a Reformed SDA church (in the<br>
higher lands east of Loma Linda).  They were welcomed politely and were<br>
permitted to join communion (which was happening that day).  A not-SDA-of-<br>
any-kind Christian visitor was there and but was not permitted to participate.<br>
My friends later showed a couple they met at that church an SoP quote wherein<br>
a non-SDA Bible-believing Christian was invited to join in foot washing/Lord's<br>
supper communion by EGW.  The Reformed SDA couple were surprised.<br>

<i>&gt; Hi, Friends,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Tonight, some of my church members are meeting from</i><br>
<i>&gt; 7:30 to 8:30 for a special prayer meeting.  It is our</i><br>
<i>&gt; desire to seek the Lord's will on a number of things, </i><br>
<i>&gt; one of which is whether the English-speaking and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Spanish-speaking congregations should merge, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; institute translated services, or whether we should</i><br>
<i>&gt; remain as we are as separate congregations.  Either way,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fairfax needs your prayers.  There are some people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who are against it, some are for it, some are indifferent,</i><br>
<i>&gt; some are threatening to transfer their membership to</i><br>
<i>&gt; other places if we do switch to translated services=AD</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's turning into a mess.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some of us have committed ourselves to truly seeking</i><br>
<i>&gt; God's guidance, and we don't feel our church should</i><br>
<i>&gt; make a move until we have earnestly sought the Lord,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and waited for His instruction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Will you please pray for our congregation?  Sometimes</i><br>
<i>&gt; people get an idea and get excited about it, and only</i><br>
<i>&gt; consult the Lord if something goes wrong.  We don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; want it to be like that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Just letting you know that I will bring this up in our prayer meeting<br>
tonight and we will be praying for the Lord's will and the members acceptance<br>
of that will.<br>

<p>
You shouldn't need to do it at every site, but unless it's in a widely<br>
carried hierarchy, even if you did it wouldn't help.  If your control<br>
message doesn't propagate, your articles certainly won't.  A group<br>
named internet.* isn't likely to get far as it is a non-standard hierarchy.<br>
<p>
A bit.* group is a good idea, and I think it has a better chance of<br>
being taken seriously than an alt group.  In the newsgroup bit.admin,<br>
the article titled "NetNews/Listserv Gateway Policy" explains how to<br>
get a gateway set up.  (If you can't find it, ask me and I'll send you<br>
a copy.)  Or email to news-admin@american.edu for information.  As far<br>
as I can tell, you don't need to create the newsgroup yourself, the<br>
people who provide the gateway will do it for you.  You then just<br>
place the gateway on your mailing list.<br>
<p>
Hope this helps,<br>

that he has diverticulitis.  The friend who took<br>
Reds to the hospital said he was doubled over in<br>
pain.  Please pray for Reds.<br>

Thanks for giving me that information I am going to try those E-mail<br>
adresses. When I was studing in Montemorelos I had a listing made by<br>
Wofgang Hans Martin Stefani and titled SDA Bibliographic Resources on<br>
Music and presented at the International Church Music conference. What I<br>
will like to know is how available that material could be for me. But I<br>
think I should write Cynthia about it, and I will. Well thanks for all<br>
your help, I need to do some research. Next Sabbath I am going to have a<br>
lecture about subliminal messages in sacred, contemporary sacred and<br>
secular music and their relationship.<br>
<p>
Thanks again, Maranatha!<br>

<i>&gt; For the record there is a branch of the reform church here in Queensland.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They meet in Ipswich and have a sign pointing to their building on the main</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ipswich side track that I take when I go to Brisbane from my parents place.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; They do not have much to do with our mainstream church that I know of.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The CB's (concerned brethren) are people still in our church and the good </i><br>
<i>&gt; things I could say about them could be written on the back of a postage </i><br>
<i>&gt; stamp in the size writing your reading now.  They are not the reformers but </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suspect many of them are very sympathetic towards them.</i><br>

<p>
I would give my manager here at Hewlett Packard high marks in all<br>
these areas; maybe I should forward you his resume.  There is only one<br>
drawback I can think of: he has no known relationship with God.  Is<br>
that a problem?<br>
<p>
Seriously, I suspect that Steve has done what we all do, i.e., we<br>
don't waste time speaking about items that are an absolute given.  For<br>
example, at a mechanical design meeting to rank priorities, someone<br>
input ruggedness as a priority.  When it came to the vote, only one<br>
person wanted to prioritize ruggedness and was shocked that no one else<br>
shared his concern.  On the contrary, everyone replied, ruggedness is<br>
not negotiable; we don't make products that are not rugged.<br>
<p>
How could we say that?  Because we have written qualification<br>
standards that our products have to pass.  I see this as one of the<br>
major benefits of belonging to a denomination.  One should expect an<br>
ordained minister to satisfy the mandatory requirements and that the<br>
examination effort could concentrate on the optional requirements.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; 	I'm reminded of Paul's missionary journeys to the Gentiles. He </i><br>
<i>&gt; went to them and told them of Jesus. Many were saved and small communities </i><br>
<i>&gt; of believers were established to live among their towns &amp; demonstrate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; love of Christ to those around them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	A few concerned people did their own missionary journey behind Paul </i><br>
<i>&gt; and told those communities that they should be circumcized and keep the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jewish days/feasts etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Paul was not pleased. He told the Gentile believers that if they</i><br>
<i>&gt; were circumcized they would no longer be saved. He told the Jews to stop</i><br>
<i>&gt; making it difficult for the Gentiles to accept Christ.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	I wonder if I see comparison with such groups as those mentioned</i><br>
<i>&gt; by Ben above and their specific laws and codes.</i><br>
<p>
You may but I see one important difference.  The above mentioned groups<br>
claimed to be part of the mainstream church of the day.  The Reformed SDA's<br>
on the other hand have essentially left our church and do not worship with<br>
the mainstreamers.  The way I see it they are not interfering with the <br>
mainstream of our church and keep pretty much to themselves.  If we spend a<br>
lot of time and energy talking about them aren't we guilty of the very thing<br>
that we appear to be accusing them of.  If they leave us alone then it is <br>
only fair that we leave them alone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	In fact I even wonder if the mainstream SDA church is guilty of</i><br>
<i>&gt; some of this - and I'd appreciate your thoughts on this issue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	When we take a non-Christian and make him/her a SDA, are we not</i><br>
<i>&gt; fettering them with the Sabbath/vegetarianism/other culturally based</i><br>
<i>&gt; behaviours? </i><br>
<p>
You bet we are!  Of course I don't have a problem with that.  When we join <br>
any human organisation we do so for two reasons.  The first is that the <br>
organisation has a set of interests or beliefs  that matches our own.  The <br>
second following on from that is that the organisation will expect us to <br>
conform to a code of behaviour.  The organisation can be anything you like - <br>
clubs, pubs, choirs, religions, politics - the list goes on.<br>
<p>
Let's take work as an organisation.  It is expect that when one is at work <br>
that one will behave in a manner pleasing to the boss and fellow workers.  <br>
Last year I was in the local city choir.  I enjoyed it but a change in <br>
circumstances made it impossible for me to perform in a manner pleasing to <br>
the producer of the show that was being organised and I had to drop out.<br>
<p>
It so happens that if one moves onto churches one sees exactly the same kind <br>
of thing.  A church is a human organisation.  It has become like this <br>
because a number of people got together that had something in common that <br>
noone else would accept.  As such it is only natural that they decide on who <br>
becomes a member of their organisation and who doesn't.  This means that I <br>
belong to this church because it suits my way of life.<br>
<p>
The real problem comes as a result of too many people pushing the idea that <br>
to be a member of this church == being saved.  The implication here is that <br>
if for some reason the church decides to disfellowship someone that they <br>
have been dammed to rot in hell.  That, I have a real problem with.  It <br>
tars us with the same brush that we have been trying to tar the catholics <br>
with for so long.<br>

Several people were surprised to find that SDAnet has taboo topics.<br>
Since this is the first time abortion has come up on SDAnet in almost 2 <br>
years, it's not surprising that many don't remember it.  There are <br>
only two "taboo topics", namely abortion and creation/evolution.<br>
Both of those got to be that way because the discussion on them rapidly<br>
degenerated to the level that one would find on the Usenet groups<br>
talk.abortion or talk.origins.  I didn't start SDAnet to duplicate the <br>
same rhetoric on both sides that happens in the world at large.  If you <br>
want to recite canned rhetoric on either side of the abortion debate,<br>
you can take your discussion elsewhere.<br>
<p>
Having said that, I recognize that SDAnet also includes many people who <br>
have something to say about this from time to time, and they should be <br>
allowed to have their say.  So when discussion on these topics comes up,<br>
we allow it to happen, but try to keep it focused to the Adventist angle<br>
of things.  Really unanswerable questions like how many abortions are<br>
going on in SDA hospitals, what should be SDA's attitude to birth control,<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
The SDA statement on abortion has been posted here before,.  I will try<br>
to dig it out of the archives, also it is available on SDA's Online.<br>
As I recall there were quite a few "motherhood" statements in there, if <br>
you'll pardon the expression.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Subject: Is abortion sin?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I have been wondering at what stage of fetal development is abortion sin?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Do we have a theological basis for our stand?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; God bless, Emil  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; =============================  </i><br>
 Sometime back I wrote to Biblical Research at GC for an answer to <br>
this question. I wanted a clear No or Yes answer. I got neither. <br>
Unfortunately I cannot locate the document they sent me which <br>
showed the official stand of the church. But it went like this:<br>
Life is sacred and no one should take it away. Abortion is <br>
unacceptable. Then it goes thru some reasoning and finally <br>
gives exceptions, such as cases of rape or mothers health in danger. <br>
I really need to check the document for details. But for sure this <br>
document did not say unequivocally that abortion is sin, period. <br>
As for whether it is sin, I think another question needs to be <br>
answered: when does life begin? In other words is it murder to <br>
destroy a fertilized egg (foetus)? Scientific evidence exist that <br>
indicate life begins after fertilization.<br>
<p>
 If not, when does it begin?<br>

If NOTHING happened in 1844, where does that leave the<br>
SDA believer? Are we deceived? Are we disappointed?<br>
How do we explain the significant spiritual developments<br>
of that time period? <br>
<p>
The main benefit from 1844 as I see it is the focus on the<br>
sanctuary on earth as a pattern or model of the sanctuary in<br>
heaven. I do not believe that SDA scholars or scholars who<br>
pooh-pooh the significance of the 2300 days have a thorough<br>
enough grasp of the heavenly sanctuary's rituals, let alone<br>
understanding of all the earthly sanctuary's rituals.<br>
<p>
To trace the movements of the earthly High Priest's<br>
on the day of atonement is a major study. To apply this<br>
information to the Heavenly Sanctuary is another study<br>
for which the book of Hebrews is but a start.<br>
<p>
Something marvellous did happen in 1844 . Exactly what did<br>
happen is still open to study. The major thing which happened<br>
as far as I am concerned is that the opening of the spiritual<br>
eyes to see that Earth is not the center of the universe,<br>
and that there is a heavenly sanctuary in which God is,<br>
and Jesus is there as my intermediary. This is a major<br>
shift in focus, and opens the eyes to eternal verities.<br>
<p>
What do you think of that?<br>

<p>
_The_Seventh-day_Adventist_Bible_Commentary_ (R&amp;H, 1954), in its<br>

The NIV contains footnotes that explain the apparent discrepancy.<br>
The relevant passages are reproduced below with the footnotes<br>
inserted in square brackets at the appropriate places:<br>
<p>
  "'I tell you the truth,' Jesus answered, 'today--yes, tonight--<br>
   before the rooster crows twice [Some early manuscripts do not<br>

                                            (Mark 14:30, NIV)<br>
<p>
  "But he denied it.  'I don't know or understand what you're<br>
   talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway<br>
   [Some early manuscripts 'entryway and the rooster crowed'].<br>
                                            (Mark 14:68, NIV)<br>
<p>
  "Immediately the rooster crowed the second time.  [Some early<br>
   manuscripts do not have 'the second time'.]  Then Peter<br>
   remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: 'Before the<br>
   rooster crows twice [Some early manuscripts do not have<br>
   'twice'.] you will disown me three times.'  And he broke<br>
   down and wept."  (Mark 14:72, NIV)<br>

<i>&gt; I hope we can get pass the pat statements, into real</i><br>

Hi, friends!<br>
<p>
This post is for folks who have worked, or are presently<br>
working, with church-sponsored programs for teenagers.<br>
I am particularly interested in how your group reached<br>
other teenagers in your community, not only the teens<br>
who were currently attending your church.<br>
<p>
If you are the parent of a teenager, when you get the<br>
opportunity, please ask your teen about some of their<br>
likes and dislikes.<br>
<p>
Praise God, a couple of my church family members have<br>
committed to working with me on this project, so now<br>
I'm on a mission.<br>
<p>
Have a nice evening in the Lord!<br>
<p>
Cori Bradford<br>

<p>
P.S.  Rashid has agreed to go to church with me again,<br>
this coming Sabbath.  The Lord is wonderful!<br>

The SDA reform movement that I am aware of may or may not be related to the<br>
one being asked about as they are in two different countries.  The one I<br>
know here in Oz considers itself a step above the mainstream SDA church.<br>
It gets its members in by cannibalising the main SDA church rather than <br>
trying to win new members from the world.<br>
<p>
I don't know enough about it to know whether or not it can be considered a <br>
cult but it is very strong on EGW and at one stage the expected behaviour <br>
of men and women were very well defined.  I can recall that women did not <br>
cut their hair.<br>
<p>
I hope that adds to the body of knowledge about the reform movement.<br>

<i>&gt; Maybe so, but then what item of food or drink (even "plain water") isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; "less safe" now than it was then?  Of course, that's counter-balanced by</i><br>
<i>&gt; modern technology concerning proper preparation of food, bacteriological</i><br>
<i>&gt; sampling, etc.  Back before you had microscopes, or even a knowledge of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence of bacteria, you had to take BROAD measures to be safe.  It was</i><br>
<i>&gt; obviously easier for God to give some simple, blanket rules than a</i><br>
<i>&gt; dissertation on microbiology.</i><br>
<p>
However even with today's knowledge we still get a large amount of micro-<br>
biological contamination if a recent TV program I saw is to be believed.  In <br>
it the journalist doing the story got hold of a number of items bought over<br>
the shelf from various sandwich shops and other fast food outlets and took <br>
them to a microbiol lab for testing.  The results were that each of these<br>
food items had at least 300,000 microbes.  So if one bought a food item<br>
from one of these stores then one could rest assured that there would be <br>
about 300,000 microbes in there about to be digested in their stomach.<br>
<p>
Amongst the bacteria found included E.Coli, S.Cocci and various other <br>
nasties.  When my wife looked at the program she was almost sick as she <br>
often has enjoyed a sandwich or to from such places in the past.  I suspect <br>
she will be less inclined towards that kind of thing in the future.  It <br>
seems to me that knowledge of such nasties is no safety net against them.  <br>
It seems that many preparers of such food hold the attitude, out of sight <br>
out of mind.  Of course to make things more interesting they stored their <br>
food items in places that made the environment for bacterial growth highly<br>
favorable.  Warm, moist and behind glass.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To put it another way, the very purest water "back then" was probably purer</i><br>
<i>&gt; than what we have available to us today.  OTOH, when a water source was</i><br>
<i>&gt; contaminated back then, it was often only discovered after the fact when</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who drank from it started getting sick or dying.  The same is true</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the meat that people ate.  While it may have been, IN GENERAL, "more</i><br>
<i>&gt; healthy, less diseased", without microscopes and modern inspection methods,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you pretty much took your chances.  While the "best" may have been better</i><br>
<i>&gt; than it is today, undoubtedly the "worst" was worse, too.</i><br>
<p>
Of course it is still much the same today with salmonella lying around.  In<br>
my experience with working in the abattoir(sp) the meat that was processed<br>
did not all go past the labs for testing.  And even if it did they have to <br>
know what they are looking for.  From what I have seen of the food <br>
processing industry any faith placed in modern inspection methods is badly <br>
misplaced.  We still take our chances every bit as much now as back in those <br>
days.<br>

<UL>
<LI>15% across-the-board tax rate cut.  Here are the tax brackets
before and after the Dole tax cut.
</UL>
<pre>
Current:		Dole tax brackets:
     39.6%                   33.67%
     36.0%                   30.60%
     31.0%                   26.35%
     28.0%                   23.8 %
     15.0%                   12.75%
</pre>
<UL>
<LI>$500 per child tax credit.  This tax credit allows parents
to subtract $500 off their tax bill for each child under 18 years
of age.  
<LI>Cut capital gains tax rate from 28% to 14%.  In 1992, 56%
of capital gains were from households with incomes of $50,000
or less.  Households with less than $100,000 income accounted
for 83% of the returns reporting capital gains.
<LI>Repeal the 1993 tax hike on Social Security benefits.  Due
to the 1993 Clinton tax increase on Social Security, 85% of Social
Security benefits became subject to federal taxation.  Retiree
incomes as low as $34,000 saw their taxes on Social Security benefits
rise.
<LI>American Dream Savings Accounts.  These accounts would expand
IRA's.  They would allow after-tax contributions and earn interest tax-free.
 They would also allow penalty-free withdrawals to help finance a first home, pay for
college expenses, or defray medical costs.  
<LI>IRA's for spouses who choose to stay at home.  A $2,000 per
year contribution can be 
put into an IRA on behalf of a spouse who works at home.
<LI>Education Investment Accounts.  These accounts allow up to
$500 per child per year to be put into tax-free account.  Parents who placed $500 per
year into the account would accrue $18,689 tax-free after 18 years.
<LI>Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Why Does America Need a Tax Cut?</FONT></B></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI>America is experiencing the slowest expansion in 100 years.
 The Clinton expansion is averaging 2.4% growth - not exactly
the best economy in the last 30 years.  The last five expansions
produced average growth rates of 4.4%.  The Reagan expansion during
the 1980's averaged over 5% growth.
<LI>Tax Freedom Day is now the latest ever.  The day Americans
work until to pay their share of federal taxes is now May 7, the
latest it's ever been.
<LI>Cost of Government day now July 3.  In 1996 Americans worked
until July 3 to earn enough money to pay off all direct and
hidden taxes (total federal, state, local government spending
plus the cost of regulation).
<LI>Real Median Household Income lower during Clinton than the
previous decade.  From 1983 to 1992, real median household income
was $33,119.  Under Clinton, it shrunk to $32,153.
<LI>Federal, State, and Local taxes account for 38% of a family's
budget (more than food, clothing, and health care combined). 
Today 26% of a family's budget goes to federal taxes, 12% to state
and local taxes, while 9% goes to food, 4% is spent on clothing,
and 10% goes for medical care.
<LI>Worker's real hourly wages have gone down under Clinton.  Bill
Clinton, the alleged protector of the working man, has presided
over a .4% drop in real hourly wages.  Wages went up 5.6% during
the decade before Clinton.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
<CENTER><B>How to Balance the Budget with the Dole Tax Cut</B></CENTER>
<P>
The economic plan of Republican Presidential nominee Robert
Dole promises to enact a major tax reduction plan and to balance
the Federal budget by 2002.  Some have argued that the lost revenue
from the tax cut plan would make balancing the budget by 2002
impossible.  The following facts show that this is untrue.
<UL>
<LI>Even counting the reduced tax revenues from the Dole tax cut
plan, the budget can be  balanced by 2002 by holding the growth
in government spending to 2.1% per year.  This is only slightly
less than the rate of increase in Federal spending since 1992,
which has been 2.4%.
<LI>Between now and 2002, the Federal government would spend $10.8
trillion overall under current law.  Counting the reduced revenue
from the Dole tax cut plan, the Federal budget can be balanced
by 2002 while still spending $10.2 trillion between now and then.
<LI>Counting the reduced revenue from the Dole tax cut plan, the
budget can be balanced by 2002 if the government spends just 4%
less than it now plans to spend between now and then.
<LI>Counting the reduced revenue from the Dole tax cut plan, the
budget can be balanced by 2002 while increasing annual Federal
spending by 14% by that year compared to this year.  Under current
law, annual Federal spending will be 20% larger by 2002 compared
to today.

	Cost of Government Day is the date of the calendar year, counting from January  1, that Americans have earned enough money to pay off the  total financial burden of government, including all state and federal spending and  regulatory costs.<P>
	The money we send to the government on April 15th is only the visible tip of a much larger iceberg.  Politicians have learned to circumvent the watchful eye of anti-tax voters by enacting hidden taxes--regulationsand government mandates.  Costly government programs, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and family leave legislation, do not show up in the federal or state budgets.  But they do cost money.<P>
 	This year, every American taxpayer will work until July 3rd--more than half way through the  year--to pay off his or  her share of government imposed financial costs. The total cost of government in 1996 is estimated at
 $3.38 trillion. That's $13,000 for every man, woman and child in 
America. Of this total, nearly $1 trillion results from federal and
state regulation. The federal government is responsible for more than
 $739 million in hidden regulatory taxes this year alone. That's more
 than $2,800 for every man, woman and child in America.<P>

<BOLD>Definition</BOLD><BR>
Cost of Government Day is the day of the calendar year, counting form January 1, on which the average American worker has earned enough in gross income to pay off his or her federal, state, and local government-imposed financial obligations--total spending plus the cost of regulation.<P>

<BOLD>Methodology</BOLD><BR>
The cost of government is determined by adding the figures for government spending (all federal, state, and local outlays) and an estimate of the cost of government regulations.  A 1992 report prepared for the Regulatory Information Service Center by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas D. Hopkins provided the framework for determining the cost of regulations.  His figures were updated to include the cost of new regulations from information provided by economist Dr. Robert Genetski and estimates by Cost of Government Day director Alan Philp.  State workers' compensation and tort costs were included in the COGD figure as well, from information provided in a report produced by the Tillinghast Company.

<BOLD>What COGD Does/Does Not Include:</BOLD><BR>
<UL>
<LI>  All federal, state, and local outlays (taxes plus borrowing) are included in COGD.
<LI>  Most federal regulations are incorporated.  Exceptions include costs associated with minimum wage laws and anti-trust laws.
<LI> At the state level, only workers' compensation and tort costs  are incorporated.  Costs associated with state and local environmental protection, worker safety, and consumer protection are not included.  These costs, which are not included because the measurements cannot readily be quantified and broken out, can be substantial.
<LI> Indirect costs of regulation--resources diverted from other activities (e.g., decreased time with families, less leisure time) -- are not included.  Compliance costs, paperwork costs, and transfer costs are included.</UL></p>




<BOLD>Overview of the Cost of Government</BOLD><BR>
 
<P>
 <UL>
<LI> Cost of Government Day has moved forward for three straight years due to (1)sharp cuts in defense spending, (2)the defeat of Bill Clinton's government take-over of the health care system, and (3)a lessening in the number of major new regulations.  Had the Clinton health care plan passed, Cost of Government Day would have moved back approximately 30 days.  Americans would be working for the government an additional month.
<LI>  Because the 1996 House Republican budget became law, at least in 
part , Cost of Government Day came earlier than in 1995.  By 2000, Cost of Government Day will arrive at least 11 days earlier than scheduled under the Clinton plan.
<LI>  By 2002, the GOP budget will make Cost of Government Day arrive at least 17 days earlier than scheduled under the Clinton plan.  (This figure does not include additional savings from proposed Republican regulatory and legal reforms.)
<LI>  Republican legal reforms, if passed, will help rein in soaring civil justice costs, which now consume $300 billion per year, according to Citizens for a Sound Economy.<P></ul>

Quantifying the Costs<bold><p>

<bold>Regulation Costs Jobs.</bold>  Economists Michael Hazilla and Raymond J. Kopp concluded that environmental regulations alone had by 1990 reduced the overall employment level by 1.18 percent.  According to economist Bill Laffer, that translates into 1.1 million to 1.4 million fewer jobs.  Laffer estimates the cost of all federal regulations numbers between 3.6 million and 9.6 million jobs.<br>

<bold>The Costs of Affirmative Action:</bold><br>
A projection based on a Forbes magazine model finds that the direct compliance costs of affirmative action programs cost the nation $25 billion per year.  But indirect costs -- paperwork, loss of efficiency, etc. -- could exceed $100 billion per year, according to the study.  According to the Congressional Research Service, about 160 federal programs, statutes, regulations, and executive orders grant some measure of "preference" to women or minorities in the areas of hiring, federal contracts, educational opportunities and grants.<br>

<bold>Losses to Farmers:</bold></br>
The American Farm Bureau  Federation estimates that U.S. agricultural interests spend between $18 billion and $20 billion per year complying with federal regulations.  To put things in perspective, that figure is roughly 35 percent of total net farm income in the United States.  If this estimate is in the ballpark, farmers spend $2 complying with government-mandated regulations for every $1 they receive in price supports.<br>

<bold>The Cost of Cleanliness:</bold><br>
According to the U.S. Commerce Department, pollution abatement and control expenditures consumed more than 18 percent of gross private domestic nonresidential investment in 1992, or $102 billion.  Over the past 20 years, U.S. businesses have been forced to divert almost 15 percent of their total fixed investment to nonproductive equipment.<br>

<bold>Automobile Prices:</bold><br>
The cost of emissions-control equipment added to a new car through the 1994 model year averages $2010, according to data supplied by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and corrected to 1993 dollars.  Californians face a major dilemma in the coming years.  Regulators there have issued quotas of zero-emissions cars that they must build and sell, starting with 2 percent of the vehicles sold in California in 1998, then rising to five percent in 2001, and to 10 percent in 2003 and beyond.  This regulation promises almost no discernible benefits.  Every new car sold in the state today is 97% clean.  Most smog is produced by the dirtiest 10% of cars.  The 100 percent clean cars will replace the 97 percent clean cars, not the worst polluters.<br>

Smoking Regulations:</bold><br>
In what is estimated will cost $8.1 billion in the first year alone, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has marching order to go out and require restaurants, retailers, office buildings owners, and others to inspect and maintain their indoor ventilation systems and ban cigarette smoking unless it takes place in separately ventillated rooms.  Government regulators have launched a crusade to stamp out smoking, based on "studies" showing secondhand smoke to be a health menace.  But the 1.19 risk ration for intensive, 40 year, day-in-day-out, pack-a-day exposure to secondhand smoke is by virtually all measures insignificant.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  Susan Eckerly, "Seeking a Regulatory Respite," The Washington Times, February 12, 1995; and Jerry Taylor, "Cancer Risks for Thee, but Not for Me," The Wall Street Journal, January 3, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Water Quality Standards:</bold><br>
In March, the EPA's Great Lakes Initiative imposed uniform standards for water quality on eight different states (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).  A study conducted for the Council of Great Lakes Governors says this will cost more than $2 billion per year and destroy up to 33,000 jobs.<br>

<bold>Air Pollution Standards:</bold><br>
Californians face $4 to $6 billion more to federal air quality regulatory costs each year.  Environmental Protection Agency regulators are marching into Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Ventura to enforce compliance with the 1977 Clean Air Act.  The state of California estimates that by 2010, "losses will total at least $8.4 billion in direct costs, $17.2 billion in output, and 165,000 jobs."<br>

<bold>Ethanol:</bold><br>
Bill Clinton frequently chooses to use regulatory dictates to reward favorite industries and constituencies.  Bowing to the powerful corn lobby, Clinton last year adopted the so-called ethanol rule, guaranteeing ethanol a 30 percent share of the oxygenate market for the reformulated gasoline program.  Ethanol is typically more expensive than its alternative, an ether known as MTBE.  Clinton's ethanol mandate was on track to cost consumers as much as $350 million per year at the gasoline pump (on top of his gas tax) and would have deprived the National Highway Trust Fund of millions of dollars of revenues because ethanol is partially tax exempt.  In April, 1995, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered Clinton at least a temporary setback, ruling Clinton exceeded his authority with the ethanol mandate.<br>

<bold>The ADA's Legal Quagmire:</bold><br>
By December, 1994, nearly 40,000 complaints were filed under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  But mounting evidence suggests massive abuse.  Eighty-five percent of complaints came from people who had jobs, one-fifth of complaints came from people with back trouble, and nearly 12 percent from those with emotional or psychiatric impairments.  These figures suggest a large amount of administrative and legal activity for an apparently modest return, considering that Congress intended to design an incentive-based approach to broadening opportunities for the disabled.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  Claudia Winkler, "Reality Check on ADA's Results," The Washington Times, April 20, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

In Sacramento, California, residents are reeling over a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ruling last fall which added three varieties of the fairy shrimp to th endangered species list.  The agency relied upon a one-paragraph petition submitted by a Davis, Calif., botanist in 1990, even though millions of the hardy shrimp can be found in California, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa.  The decision has shut down a pony ranch that housed a Sacramento program for needy and disabled children and could cost the Sacramento-area housing industry $550 million.<br>

Pushing forward with the next stage of the 1990 Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has created a new paperwork nightmare for companies in high smog urban areas called the Employee Commute Option (ECO).  Employers in these regions are forced to find ways to cajole a designated percentage of their workers into carpools -- or face devastating financial penalties that can reach as high as $25,000 per violation.  Eric Peters, an automotive writer for <ADDRESS>The Washington Times</ADDRESS> observes that "the real genius of the ECO mandate is that it turns employers -- not the government or the EPA -- into the bullyboy."

The EPA also announced new emissions standards for marine engines, one of the last unregulated emissions sources.  Since marine engines are responsible for only about three percent of total emissions, the new standards are unlikely to have any noticeable effect on air quality.  But consumers will notice.  The high-performance, fuel-injected marine engines necessary to comply with the mandate can cost $1,200 (15%) more than conventional engines, a nationwide cost of as much as $300 million per year.<br>

Food and Drug Administration rules implemented by FDA head David Kessler are costing lives.  In 1991, Dr. Kessler prohibited pharmaceutical companies from informing doctors of new uses for approved drugs.  In one instance, the FDA stopped a pharmaceutical company from distributing free copies of "The Chemotherapy Source Book"--even though the company had already received FDA approval to give away thousands of copies.  The FDA claims that when a drug company gives doctors free textbooks that mention an off-label use of its products, the drugs become subject to seizure.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  James Bovard, "First Step to an FDA Cure:  Dump Kessler,"  The Wall Street Journal, December 8, 1994.</ADDRESS><p>

Bob Floyd of Muncie, Ind., had a "wetland" mysteriously appear on his property when a local business accidentally cut a drainage pipe.  Federal regulators swooped in to protect this "wetland" and forced the 80-year-old farmer to stop farming.  The so-called wetland has since dried up, but Mr. Floyd may have to sell the land his family has farmed for a half century.

Bob Lindberg, president of Young Co. in Seattle, thought his small metal firm had a decent diversity record -- with a work force that included about 35 percent women and minorities -- until the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) came knocking on his door.  The agency accused the firm, which is a subcontractor for a company that supplies anchors to the Navy, of a number of charges including failing to hire qualified Asian applicants.  Young opened his books to the auditors, spent thousands of dollars on a consultant, and finally settled in part by paying $47,000 in back wages to some minority workers.<br>

John Thorpe's plans to build on his own property were thwarted by the Fish and Wildlife Service, which demanded to know what steps he had taken to preserve the salt marsh harvest mouse.  Though Mr. Thorpe only wanted to develop mostly on the dry, upland portion of his propery, an agency of the U.S. government theorized that when golboal warming melts the polar ice-caps, the Pacific will rise and inundate the habitat of the salt marsh harvest mouse on his lowlands, forcing it to seek refuge on Thorpe's highlands.  For this science fiction story, Thorpe was denied permission to develope his land.<br>

In an example of the lawsuit frenzy borne of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, in July, 1992, GTE Data Services in Tampa discovered that one of its computer programmers had been stealing money from other employees and had brought a loaded derringer to work.  When he was fired for having the gun, he sued for reinstatement under the ADA.  He said he was the victim of a mental illness aggravated by improper medication , and thus disabled under the language of the act.  The first court ruling - later overturned -- went in the programmer's favor:  "When poor judgment is a sympton of a mental or psychological disorder, it is defined as an impairment that would qualify as a disability under the ADA," the court said.

David and Florence Isbell -- well known in activist legal circles in Washington -- teamed up with the Washington Lawyers' Committee to force Washington area theaters to install special assistive listening devices.  Cineplex theaters, the unfortunate target of the Isbell's crusade, had been installing the equipment in theaters around the nation when the Isbell's filed suit.  In response, Cineplex accelerated the installation plan for the Washington area and had all theaters equipped by August 31.  Thinking the problem had been solved, Cineplex asked the U.S. District court to dismiss the suit.  The lead attorney for the Washington Lawyers' Committee refused to back down.  Cineplex ageed to pay $60,000 in attorneys' fees and accept the supervision of a court appointed monitor.  Howard Lichtman, executive vice president of the Cineplex chain, says the rate of requests for the devices "is infinitesimal."

The Republican Congress should set specific goals for the movement of Cost of Government Day.  Specifically, legislators should target a Cost of Government Day 1996 on or before July 4th, so that Americans can truly enjoy their liberation from the government on Independence Day.  Likewise, Congress should aim for a Cost of Government Day 2005 on or before April 15th so Americans can truly enjoy the fruits of the labor by the time they file their taxes.<p>

Heighten public attention about "bureaucratic tyranny" by establishing a monthly "Corrections Day" and holding public "show trials" of wasteful government programs and abusive regulations.

Bar unelected federal bureaucrats from making laws.  Ultimately, no law should go into effect without the consent of a majority of the House, a majority of the Senate, and the signature of the President.  Lawmakers should take direct responsibility for laws by enacting them themselves.  Agency bureaucrats can make recommendations, conduct risk assessment, and propose legal language, but should not be allowed to make laws themselves.<br>

Reduce the number of government regulators.  From 1985 to 1992, staffing of federal regulatory agencies increased by over 20 percent.  By 1992, the federal government employed almost 125,000 regulatory employees, and that total has increased under Bill Clinton.  One way Congress can reduce "bureaucratic tyranny," as Speaker Gingrich has described it, is by reducing the number of government regulators.  Too often, regulators seek to justify their own existence by implementing time consuming and overly bureaucratic mandates on state and local governments and private businesses. <p> Congress should send regulators a message:  Overzealous regulatory behavior will be punished, not rewarded.  State and local governments must follow suit.  During the 1980's, state-level bureaucracies increased by almost 20 percent.  Whereas the federal government employes about two million civilian employees, state and local governments employ more than six times that amount.<br>

Demand proper risk assessment of all proposed regulations.  Government regulators are notorious for devoting huge resources to relatively insignificant risks -- like asbestos exposure in schools -- at tremendous cost to companies and consumers.  For example, look at EPA's risk assessment for a Superfund site.  You will learn about hypothetical children who eat dirt 250 days a year from the bottom of contaminated brooks and ponds.  Likewise, the Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that local governments get rid of virtually all chloroform in their water, even though the best available science suggests that chloroform does not pose a danger in the biological mechanisms associated with drinking tap water.  Risk assessment should quantify the cost of all proposed regulations and rank risks in order of priority.  Target risks should be compared to several ordinary risks that people confront in their daily lives.  In addition, regulators should be required to consider competing risks -- dangers induced by regulators.  For example, Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards requiring "fuel efficient" automobiles are resulting in smaller, less safe cars and more deaths and injuries on the road.<br>

Remote-sensing technology can identify dirt cars, reducing the role of government and freeing most auto-owners from bureaucratic harassment.<br>

Reform the 1974 Clean Water Act to specifically and reasonably define what constitutes a wetland.  Under current rules, federal regulators have construed the Clean Water Act to classify huge tracts of land as wetlands for protection from development, even though the 1974 statute says nothing about welands protection.  Bipartisan legislation sponsored by Rep. Bud Shuster calling on the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Agriculture to classify all existing welands based on function and environmental importance into categoies A (high priority), B (modest priority) and C (low priority)  would put an end to egregious bureaucratic regulatory "takings" from private land-owners.<br>

Enact Long-awaited Banking Reform.  Existing banking laws -- largely incorporated in the 1930's-era Glass-Seagall Act -- are woefully outdated, sharply restricting or prohibiting the ability of banks to expand across state lines, sell insurance, or provide investment underwriting.  As a result, American banks are at a tremendous disadvantage in the world market.  Congress should repeal antiquated laws such as the Glass-Seagall Act and promote competition in the American banking industry.  A recent McKinsey & Co. study found that the annual costs of interstate banking under today's cumbersome regulatory structure can range from .5 percent to almost one percent of a company's noninterest expenses -- a total in the billions of dollars.  And these savings are dwarfed by those that will come from the nationwide consolidations of operations.

Repeal market regulations on telecommunications providers.  The long distance and local telephone markets, as well as the cable television market, should be opened up to competition.  Current law, based on the 1934 Communications Act based on 19th century railroad regulation, imposes restrictions which ensure virtual monopolies in existing phone and cable markets.  These antiquated regulations should come to an end, and the cable-telco ban, which prevents telephone and cable firms from competing against each other, should be repealed.  Competition between long distance and local phone companies and cable television providers will reduce prices and ensure better service for consumers.  The 1992 Cable Act should be repealed.

States around the country have been forced to reform their budgeting and tax policies due to their deficit spending.  Many states have been successful in trimming their deficits without raising taxes.  The method used by the most successful states has been supermajority tax limitation laws and spending limitation laws. <b>One third of all Americans live in a state withe supermajority constitutional tax limitations.  In most of the states supermajority requirements, the idea of requiring a greater than fifty percent vote of the legislature to increase taxes grew out of the tax revolt movement and the initiative process.</b>  These states offer a successful model for the Federal Government's budget and tax reform efforts.  The following states have supermajority tax limitation requirements:

<p>

From the early days of the Republic to the present, supermajority voting requirements have been part of the U.S. Constitution. Supermajority requirements are found in the following sections of the Constitution:
<p>



<TABLE BORDER>

<TH>Article                        </th>

<th>Applies To:                  </th><tr>

<td>Article 1, section 3, clause 6</td>

<td>Conviction in impeachment trials</td><tr>

<td>Article 1, section 5, clause 2</td>

<td>Expulsion of a Member of Congress</td><tr>

<td>Article I, section 7, clause 2</td>	

<td>Override a presidential veto</td><tr>

<td>Article II, section 1, clause 3</td>	<td>Quorum of two-thirds of the states to elect the President</td><tr>

<td>Article II, section 2, clause 2</td>	<td>Consent to a treaty</td><tr>

<td>Article V</td>	<td>Proposing constitutional amendments</td><tr>

<td>Article VII</td>	<td>State ratification of the original Constitution</td><tr>

<td>Amendment XII</td>	<td>Quorum of two-thirds of the states to elect the President and the Vice President.</td><tr>

<td>Amendment XIV</td>	<td>To remove disability of those who have engaged in insurrection</td><tr>

<td>Amendment XXV section 4</td>	<td>Presidential disability</td><tr>





</table></body></html>

<P><P>
	
The Framers' decision not to impose additional constitutional supermajority requirements does not mean that they opposed extending the concept. It simply means that at the time of ratification they did not see a need for other supermajority requirements. However, they did recognize that circumstances change and that the Constitution would need to be flexible to change with the passage of time. Consequently, they provided a mechanism to amend the Constitutionan amendment mechanism that itself requires two supermajority voting requirements: Congressional adoption of the proposed amendment by a 2/3 supermajority and then approval by three-fourths of the states for ratification.
<p>
	Finally, a supermajority requirement for increasing the U.S. tax burden is not unprecedented. The 16th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides for the income tax, had to be approved by a vote of two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states. It is only logical that we should extend this protection to increases of the tax burden that are far in excess of the small burden first imposed in 1913.airness Restoration Act" introduced by Texas Congressman and House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Most people call it "the flat tax" for short.<P>

<P>

<DD>Candidates and elected officials began taking the pledge in 1986. After President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed,
many taxpayers feared that some politicians would raise income tax rates. With President Reagan's support and endorsement,
Americans for Tax Reform and a broad-based coalition of groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National
Federation of Independent Businesses and hundreds of taxpayer groups throughout the nation began to ask all candidates for
public office to "take the pledge." Every year, all Members of Congress are asked to take the pledge by Americans for Tax
Reform, and all challengers are asked to take the pledge during each election cycle.

<CENTER> <B><FONT SIZE=5>Taxing the Food Out of Your Mouth</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Peter J. Ferrara<BR>

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
 Last April, after you finished doing your income taxes and sent
them off to the IRS, you may have needed a break.  So you may
have gathered up your family to go out to your favorite restaurant
for dinner.  What you probably didn't realize was how much you
were <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/mealoped.html">paying in taxes again</a> at the restaurant.
<P>
 In most places, you of course must pay sales tax on your bill.
 Many jurisdictions impose special, higher sales taxes on drinks
or food sold at restaurants.  So the sales tax can be as high
as 10% of your bill.
<P>
 But that is only the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays to the restaurant, the restaurant must pay Federal income
taxes, state income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, sales taxes,
capital gains taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's compensation
taxes, business license taxes and fees, utility taxes, local property
taxes, and any local income taxes.  The restaurant also must pay
Federal and state excise taxes on its telephones.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes average 17.6% of a typical restaurant
bill.  Counting the sales taxes paid directly by the consumer,
this means about one-fourth, or as much as 27.6%, of what you
pay for a meal at a restaurant ends up going to the government
in taxes rather than to the restaurant.
<P>
 So if the bill for dinner for your family comes to $40, about
$10-$11 ends up going to the government in taxes.  The cost of
everything else going into your meal, including the food, its
delivery, its preparation, salaries for the restaurant employees,
and other restaurant overhead, is covered by the remaining $29-$30.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.
<P>

<CENTER><h2><A NAME="BM_1_"><FONT FACE="Times">Frequently Asked Questions<br> about the Taxpayer Protection Pledge<BR></h2>
</FONT></A></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">When did the pledge begin?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Candidates and elected officials began taking
the pledge in 1986.  After President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of
1986 was passed, many taxpayers feared that some politicians would
raise income tax rates.  With President Reagan's support and endorsement,
Americans for Tax Reform and a broad-based coalition of groups
including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation
of Independent Businesses and hundreds of taxpayer groups throughout
the nation began to ask all candidates for public office to &quot;take
the pledge.&quot;  Every year, all Members of Congress are asked
to take the pledge by Americans for Tax Reform, and all challengers
are asked to take the pledge during each election cycle. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">How many Members of Congress have taken
the pledge?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> As of November 1, 1995, 199 members of the
House of Representatives and 32 members of the Senate have taken
the pledge.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">Just what does the pledge commit a Member
of Congress to do</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times">?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> The pledge commits a member to oppose and
vote against any effort to raise the federal income tax on individuals
or corporations.  The pledge does not stand in the way of any
tax decreases or revenue neutral changes to the income tax.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">What if I wanted to trade one tax deduction
or credit for another of equal value?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> No problem.  The pledge only opposes changes
in tax deductions or credits that increase the tax burden on Americans.
 Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer has proposed restoring tax
deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed and trading
it for a tax credit of equal value that gives preference to businesses
that sell television and radio stations to certain politically
favored groups.  As this is revenue neutral, the pledge is not
violated.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">What about a cut in the capital gains tax
that would increase revenue</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times">?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> A cut in tax rates is always allowed under
the pledge.  Americans for Tax Reform strongly supports reducing
the capital gains tax rate.  All tax rate reductions that increase
revenue due to economic growth are allowable under the pledge
and are greatly desired.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">Do I have to take the pledge every time
I run for office?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> No.  A candidate only needs to take the pledge
once.  Candidates are always welcome to take the pledge each election
cycle and show their continued support of taxpayers.</FONT>

<title>Dick Armey's Flat Tax -- ATR</title>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>F</FONT></B>lat <FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>ax Will Make the Tax Code Family-Friendly Again</B><P></H2><IMG SRC="blueline.gif"><CENTER><EM>by Rep. Dick Armey (R-texas)</EM><P></CENTER></CENTER>

   Many families today say they need two incomes to make ends meet, and they're right but
not for the reason most people think.  They need two incomes because of the high cost of
government:  one to support themselves, and a second to pay their taxes and support the politicians.<P>  
In recent decades, the government has grown so large so fast that over 40 percent of an average family's earnings is soaked up by taxes.  A typical family now pays more in taxes than it spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined.<P>
     In addition, Americans today spend 5.4 billion man-hours a year calculating how much they
owe Uncle Sam in taxes.   The overall size of government itself is undermining families'abilities to live the American dream.  That's why I introduced a bill, the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act, designed to cut the size and influence of Washington.  It will revolutionize everything the government does-taxing, spending, and regulating-and allow us to keep more of our money and live the way we believe is right. <P>
     The bill starts by replacing our entire current income tax code with a flat tax.  After seven
decades of abuse by corporate lobbyists and self-righteous income redistributors, our tax code is a mess.  Rates are high, loop-holes abound, and families are burdened as never before.<P>  
My bill would scrap the entire code and start over with a simple, low, flat tax.  Modeled after a
plan that Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka proposed in 1981, it would work like this: You would
add up your earned income, subtract a large personal allowance ($13,100 for a single person,
$26,000 for a married couple filing jointly), take away $5,300 for each child (which is double the
current amount), and then pay a flat 17 percent rate on the remainder.  That's it.  There would be
no special interest deductions or loop-holes of any kind.  You could figure your taxes on a form
as small as a post-card.  In fact, while it takes the average taxpayer 11 hours to do his taxes today, you could this figuring in ll minutes-with no fear that you made a mistake that'll bring out the IRS auditors or missed some clever loopholes that everyone knows about but you.<P>
     Why a 17 percent rate?  That's low enough to give virtually all Americans a major tax cut, but
high enough to meet the government's revenue needs (which will, of course, be reduced under this plan).  With a doubled child deduction, families with children will do especially well.<P>
     Now, the soak-the-rich crowd reflexively claims that a flat tax is by definition unfair.  That's
flat wrong.  Fairness is in fact the flat tax's great virtue.  It's based on the idea of fairness we
learned in grade school : Everyone should be treated the same.  Rather than have fallible
politicians decide which groups should surrender more or less of their earnings to the government, the flat tax sets a single objective standard.<P>
     Indeed, this system will be as progressive as the income tax system we had when John
Kennedy was president.  How so?  The plan's high personal allowance mean that the middle class income folks will pay a far lower portion of their total income to the government than the
wealthy, even if their tax rate is the same.<P>
     A typical family of four, for instance, will pay no income taxes at all on their first $36,800 of
income-the 17 percent rate will only apply to income above that.  As many as 10 million poor
people will be removed from the tax roles entirely.  If you want progressive, this gets the job done without a complicate tax code as long as the Encyclopedia Britanninca.<P>
     Of course, there will be the predictable objections.  Vested interests will fear the loss of such
breaks as the home mortgage deduction.  But by removing the tax code's current punishment for
saving, the plan will swell the capital pool, causing interest rates to drop and demand for housing
to rise.  As housing values hold or increase under the plan-and economic growth soars-only
Washington tax lobbyists will be nostalgic for the old way.  With the flat tax, there will be a single
readily grasped objective standard.  The only thing that matters is whether you have children. 
Otherwise you are treated the same as everyone else.  <P>
     All Americans will benefit mightly form the higher wages and new jobs that such a rational tax
system would be sure to create.  Our twisted tax system today treats investing in new jobs the
same way it treats cigarette smoking-by discouraging it with especially high taxes.    If you want
to put some of your earnings in a stock or mutual fund, that money is hit with double-taxation: it's
taxedwhen you invest it.  No wonder wages have been flat and job growth low.<P>
     The flat tax would end this craziness.  There would, in effect, be no capital gains tax, no tax on dividends or interest, nor would there be a tax on whatever inheritance we try to leave for our
children (why work a lifetime so the government can take half of what you leave behind?).  This
would unleash American talent, work and creativity as never before.  Economic growth would
soar.<P>
     We would still have a tax on business income, of course, but it would be the same flat 17
percent rate that we'd pay on personal income, and a far simpler system for small businesses to
manage than today's ridiculously complicated code.  They would not need to wrestle with
depreciation schedules or other arcania.  They would simply subtract all their expenses from their revenues and pay 17 percent.<P>
     Make no mistake, though, the flat tax is more than just a good government reform to make our tax system simple, fair and pro-growth.  It's a way of telling politicians that we're tired
of being toyed with.   Congress didn't design our tax system to raise revenue for the government
efficiently.  It doesn't do that.  They use it the same they use spending programs-to direct our
money at whatever causes or inerest groups they think are important. 
     Government does not have the competence or the right to make those decisions.  We should
have a tax system that is neutral and let 250 million free Americans decide where their money
should go. <P>
     Oh, and one last thing.  This 17 percent flat tax rate with these personal deductions means a
big tax cut for everyone-especially families who would see their child deduction double. The best
way to keep politicians form spending more and more of other people's money is to reduce their
supply.  Let them cut spending instead. <P>

</FONT><ADDRESS>By Rep. Dick Armey</ADDRESS>

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="gstil.gif" ALT=DICK ARMEY>


	<FONT SIZE=+2>G</Font>overnment spends, taxes, and regulates too much.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>O</Font>f all the crises facing America, this one is paramount.  Many other major national problems flow from this fact or are greatly compounded because of it.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>S</Font>tagnant wages and stifled job growth, urban violence and poverty, and soaring health care and education costs are all closely related to or influenced by the unchecked expansion of the public sector.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>	O</Font>n a deeper level, the growth of government is our most critical problem because it so greatly affects the definition of what it means to be an American.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>O</Font>ur government has expanded, it has assumed duties that previously belonged to families and communities, leaving those institutions weaker and government stronger.  A distinct governing class emerged with a taste for power and an appetite for more.  Often relying upon guile, some leaders of this class worked to extend government's intrusive power far beyond what earlier American generations would have tolerated.  Today, we find ourselves staggering under an immense government burden, serving an entrenched elite that in many ways presumes to be wiser and nobler than the rest of us.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>B</Font>asic American rights should include freedom from unfair demands of distant rulers and the right to use our own efforts to build a better future for our children.  Clearly these rights are being undermined by excessively big government and something is very wrong.  Unrestrained growth of government is a threat to the American Dream.  Consider what runaway governmental power  means to the aspirations of a typical American family.<P>
	"John and Marie Hargas" of Westerville, Ohio, work hard, make mortgage payments, save for their children's college tuition, and give to their church and charities.  Their primary ambition is to make life better for themselves and their two small children.<P>
But each year as April 15 approaches, they typically spend eleven hours filling out IRS forms.  When they're through, they discover that more than a quarter of their income has fled to government bureaucrats five hundred miles away in Washington, D.C.  That amount includes 10.5 percent in direct income taxes, and a whopping 15.5 percent in FICA payroll taxes for payments to Social Security.  The government takes Hargas' earnings from their employers before the Hargases ever see it.  <FONT SIZE=+1>Their state and local taxes take 12.6 percent of their income.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>I</Font>n all, more than 40 percent of the Hargases earnings support government at all levels.  <Address>That is more than they spend on food, clothing and shelter combined.</Address>  In effect, all the work they do from January 1 to May 6 each year is for government.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>E</Font>very American is entitled to ask these fundamental questions: "Does government really have to cost this much?  Are we really getting our money's worth?  Is this a fair cost for the value we receive from government?"<P>
 <FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>n addition to direct taxes, there is a hidden cost of government that is much more difficult to measure.  That immense additional cost of government is caused by regulations which increase the price of every product and service we buy from peanut butter to cars.<P>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>R</Font>egulations add at least $580 billion in annual costs to U.S. consumers.  That means the Hargases must spend another large part of their income bearing their share of the rule-writers' burden.  According to <BOLD>Americans for Tax Reform</BOLD>, Americans actually labor until <A HREF="/atr/cogdpak.html">July 9</A> before they stop working for the government's ends and begin working for their own.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</Font>he Hargases think of themselves as free Americans living in a fair society.  But how free are they really?	In America's peacetime history, never before has government had so much power over family life.<P>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>T</Font>he U.S. public sector budget is larger than the gross domestic product of any country in the world except for Japan and the U.S. itself.  Since 1950, per capita federal spending has tripled.  Federal spending alone has risen from 16 percent of our 1950 economy to 23 percent in 1991.  By the year 2000, spending could be 27 percent of GNP and reach  31 percent by 2010 unless something is done to reverse the trend. <P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>B</Font>ased on current projections, the <BOLD>annual federal budget
</BOLD> will reach nearly 
<UL><L1><BOLD>$1.9 trillion by the year 2000,</BOLD> <L1>
<BOLD>$2.7 trillion in 2010</BOLD> <L1><BOLD>$4 trillion by the year 2020.</UL><BOLD>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>	E</Font>ach new dollar government spends and each increase in the size of the government relative to the economy represents an encroachment on the freedom of individual taxpayers.  For people like John and Marie Hargas, that means an ever larger portion of their income will be taken from them.  They will have less control over their lives as the government class, dominated by political professionals, becomes more powerful.  Both the Hargas family and the nation will become poorer as freedom is taken away.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</Font>mericans face a fundamental choice:  Should the government become ever larger as freedom diminishes--or should we take dramatic action now to halt the growth of government and restore greater freedom to our country?<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</Font>he "Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act"
 is a way of saying "Enough is Enough."	It is a comprehensive assault on Big Government, designed to halt its growth, expose its true cost, and limit its influence on the lives of free Americans.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>I</Font>t does this by radically reordering the three major activities of the federal government: taxing, spending, and regulating.
<hr noshade=40%><br>
 The Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act proposes:<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2><BOLD>A Flat Tax.</BOLD></FONT>  Scraps the current tax code and replaces it with a simple and neutral tax code based on 17 percent flat tax on all income.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Rigid Spending Caps.</BOLD></FONT>   Places unbreachable spending caps on all forms of federal spending to ensure that the federal government will never grow larger in real terms than it is today.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Program Sunsets</BOLD></FONT>.  Forces the true reinvention of government by ending the authorization of  virtually all existing federal spending programs. <P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Open Government</BOLD></FONT>.  Exposes the hidden cost of government, ending income tax withholding and 	requiring the government for  the first time to calculate the cost of regulations.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Regulatory Relief</BOLD></FONT>.  Treats regulations much like federal spending, requiring annual calculation of  the total costs to the nation of complying with federal regulations, and providing means for limiting this burden.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Property Rights Protection.</BOLD></FONT>  Secures property rights by requiring the government to compensate landowners whenever federal regulations significantly reduce the value of their property.  <P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Rational Risk Assessment</BOLD></FONT>.  Requires the government to determine the cost, benefits, and risks of 	all new regulations before it imposes new costs on the economy.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>	The excessive growth of government is the central problem of our time. We need the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act to contain that growth once and for all. </font><P>

Their is a new name for tax relief:  "The Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act" introduced by Texas Congressman and House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Most people call it "the flat tax" for short.<P>

Armey would vaporize the entire federal income tax code and replace it with a simple plan.  Individual taxpayers would add up all their income form wages, salaries, or pension.  Then they would subtract a generous personnel allowance -- $13,100 for a single person, $17,200 for a single head of household, or $26,200 for a married couple, plus $5300 for each dependent.  Then they pay a flat 17 percent on what's left.<P>

Thus, a family of four would pay no income tax on income under $36,000.  A family of six -- two parents, four children -- would pay no tax on income under $47,400.<P>

The small business owner would add up total receipts less cash wages and the cost of goods, services, and supplies used in the business, as well as all capital equipment.  Then he or she pays a flat 17 percent on the remainder.  Translation: the business owner pays only a pure tax on business profits as generally conceived, before tax accountants, lobbyists, lawyers, and politicians start messing things up.<P>

The flat tax permits no credits, deductions, exceptions, or loopholes.  There is nothing that allows elected officials a foothold in the system.  Big business plays by exactly the same rules small business does.  Big companies get no special breaks and cannot easily lobby for them.  Business and individuals alike pay taxes only for themselves; they do not become veritable arms of the IRS collecting for other peoples as they do in a sales tax system.<P>

Best of all, there are no depreciation schedules.  Business owners get immediate expensing for all capital purchases.  There is also no inheritance tax.  Your heirs will pay tax on the income your business or farm generates when you leave it to them.  Maintenance of family business or family farms becomes far easier.  The government gets no information about what your financial holdings are.<P>

Armey modeled his proposal on a 1981 plan by Stanford Economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, which many consider the simplest and most elegant tax system ever devised.  The beauty of the flat tax is that it taxes all income, just once, visibly, with no intermediary between government and taxpayer, in a way that allows taxpayers to unite against profligate government.<P>

In keeping with its inherent libertarianism, the flat tax is also perfectly neutral with respect to all economic decisions.  There is no penalty against saving, to be sure, and no double or triple taxation of corporate income.  But on the other hand, there is no bias against saving either.  You can save or consume, spend now or spend later, invest your money wisely or waste it if you will.  You can buy foreign goods and luxury items or the cheapest domestic products, even goods from industries with more or less political protection.  There is no way a government planner can encourage you to spend money one wary or the other with differential taxation.  Your purchasing decisions just don't matter.  The tax in all cases is exactly the same.<P>

Compare the falt tax to our present system, which favors consumption over investment, short term over long term horizons, debt over equity, and service over manufacturing industry.  Many in big business and the world of policy wonkery say we should tax consumption more to level the playing field.  Armey says no.  We should tax everything, across the board, less.<P>

Armey builds on the fundamental insight that taxes need reforming because taxes are too high and government spends too much.  The current U.S. tax code is a crazy hodge-podge of conflicting features for a single reason:  once politicians get hold of a tax, they just can't let go.  As a result, minor fixes that could make the current tax code much less a barrier to long term growth just don't get made.  Politicians won't pay for tax simplification and lower marginal rates even if it means much better economic performance over time.  They would much rather have a little money to buy some nice fresh pork right now.<P>

This why we have a capital gains tax.  Capital gains as now administered is a relatively small levy which costs the economy disastrously in terms of lost economic growth.  There is no economic justifications whatever for the tax, but at least we could lessen its impact by adjusting asset bases for inflation, as the Contract with

	By April 15 in most years or April 17 this year, you have filed your tax returns. Maybe you think you are finished with your obligations to Uncle Sam and  now you can enjoy the fruits of your labor for the rest of the year. Right?<P>
	Not so fast. The taxes you paid are really only the visible tip of a much larger iceberg whose deadly mass remains hidden from view. The bulk of these hidden costs come from deficit spending and added costs to all goods and services which are generated by government regulations.<P>
	 The costs are real, they are just not easy to see.  That's no accident.  For years liberal legislators and activist bureaucrats have used stealth budgets to push the growth of government and mushroom federal spending. When hidden regulatory costs are added to the burdens of direct taxes, the price tag is staggering.<P>
	Consider the 12-month calendar.  If you started working on January 1, you would have to work all the way to July 9, more than half the year, to pay for  costs of both taxes and regulations.  Only then, five days after Independence Day,  are you able to start keeping your hard-earned money for your own needs.<P>
  	Imagine America's founders rolling in their graves at the thought of Americans placed in involuntary servitude to their own government until after July 4. Today's government, with its ferocious appetite for taxpayer dollars, eats away at our economic liberty.  The federal tax system of 1995 makes the English Parliament's Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Acts and tea duties of 1767, and the Intolerable Acts of 1774 all combined look miniscule in comparison.<P>
	For many years, the Tax Foundation calculated "Tax Freedom Day" as the theoretical calendar day that taxpayers stop working to pay direct taxes.  This year, Tax Freedom Day is May 6.<P>
  	But almost every year since 1969, the federal government has spent several percentage points of GNP more than it takes in from taxes. "Spending Freedom Day" therefore is a date still later (May 16) which marks the day Uncle Sam stops spending the combined earnings of all citizens.  Right now, the national debt has a huge impact on the budget.  Three percent of GNP must be devoted just to pay interest on the debt.  That's more money for interest than for national defense.<P>
	But Tax Freedom Day and Spending Freedom Day don't fully measure the true burden that Washington imposes on citizens.  Why?  Because regulations generated by federal agencies drive up the prices of everything produced or sold in America including services.  The extra money and human resources businesses must spend to comply with regulations is just as much a financial burden on consumers as direct taxes.<P>
   	In 1993, Americans for Tax Reform Foundation originated the idea of calculating the additional days that Americans had to work to pay for regulations beyond Tax Freedom Day and called it "Cost of Government Day."   The purpose of Cost of Government Day is to help people understand the true cost of government's tax and regulatory burden combined.<P>
 	Cost of Government Day is the total percentage of Net National Product consumed by government spending and estimated total regulatory costs.  Government spending is projected in the president's budget forecast.  A reasonable estimate of federal regulatory costs can be made from a 1992 study by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas Hopkins.<P>
 	This year, July 9 is Cost of Government Day.  That is the date beyond Tax Freedom Day that Americans have earned enough in gross income to pay off their share of government-imposed financial obligations.  It moves later in the year as government spending and hidden taxes increase.<P>
	For two years, we have been paying for President Clinton's 1993 tax hikes.  Every time we buy gasoline we pay higher excise taxes.  Every time we buy groceries or clothing, we pay the so-called "millionaire's" tax.  That tax was supposed to "soak the rich" but really hit small business operators who file personal income taxes rather than corporate income taxes.<P>
	State and local taxes have also increased due to Clinton administration policies.  Unfunded federal mandates and regulations imposed by past Congresses or activist bureaucrats have forced state or local government to spend more money and raise taxes to pay for the mandate.<P>
 	For example, in 1970, Illinois was a leader among states that designed special education programs for children with developmental disabilities.  The programs are costly.  But citizens of that state supported spending money to make sure children with special needs were offered as many educational opportunities as circumstances permitted.<P>
	But Congress took a good idea and ran amok with the passage of Public Law 94-142.  Opportunities became "rights" which imposed massive costs on local school districts all over the country.  Federal regulations made it nearly impossible for school administrators to make common-sense distinctions between special educational costs and purely medical ones.  School boards began to ask if it is really fair that a single student with special needs could cost a district more than $100,000 per year without federal reimbursement that Congress promised when the law passed.<P>
	This pattern of political excess permeates everything Congress did for decades from unjustified increases in federal deposit insurance to unjustified micromanagement of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Mayor Gregory S. Lashutka of Columbus, Ohio, describes unfunded mandates this way:  "It's like having your Uncle Sam take you to lunch, order your food, and then hand you the check."<P>
	But by far the most expensive silent taxes are federal regulations and unfunded mandates on private business.  In 1993 and 1994, President Clinton's allies in Congress approved a towering stack of new regulations.   The new rules combined with all previous regulations, cost Americans more than $700 billion, or $2,800 per person, in 1994.<P>
	But we should count our blessings.  Had the Clinton administration's 1993 plan for a national health care system become law, Cost of Government Day would be approximately one month later.  We would be working for government well into August.<P>
	In November, 1994, a decisive majority of voters asked for change in the direction Congress has traveled for decades.  Much of that desire for change was fueled by citizens who believed the burden of mandates on state and local governments and regulations on private employers has become far too heavy compared to the benefits that those regulations were supposed to realize.<P>
 	Much evidence suggests the regulatory revolt which shook ballot boxes last November has plenty of steam left. California, for example, faces a ticking time bomb.  Golden State voters are circulating petitions for a hugely popular initiative that would eliminate affirmative action regulations and save the state billions of dollars every year.  Affirmative action programs were originally designed to redress past unjustified discrimination in society at large.  But many have evolved as a system which awards jobs, contracts, scholarships, and academic degrees by arbitrary quotas based on gender or racial identification rather than on merit or qualifications of an applicant.   The nationwide costs of affirmative action programs are estimated at $25 billion per year.<P>
	Indirect costs (not included in Cost of Government Day) of filling out paperwork, reorganizing the workplace, and lost time are in excess of $100 billion per year, according to a 1993 Forbes magazine estimate.   Consider some other examples of regulatory excess which concern voters:
1. Last September, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service relied on a one-paragraph petition by a botanist at the University of California, Davis, to declare three varieties of "fairy shrimp" in Sacramento to be an "endangered" species.  Even though millions of the hardy shrimp are found in irrigation ditches and ponds in California, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa, the "endangered" designation caused the closing of a pony ranch that housed a program for needy and disabled children.  The action could cost the Sacramento housing industry $500 million.<P>
2. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is using the 1990 Clean Air Act to create the Employee Commute Option (ECO).  This regulation mandates companies with more than 100 employees located in high-smog urban areas to force a percentage of workers to use carpools.  Violations can cost $25,000 each.  As Eric Peters, an automotive writer for <ADDRESS>The Washington Times</ADDRESS> noted, "The real genius of the ECO mandate is that it turns employers-not the government or the EPA-into the bullyboy."<P>
3. Republican congressional leaders and California initiative backers are leading a national crusade to rein in the cost of lawsuits.  Tort settlements cost the nation at least $150 billion per year.  Creighton Hale, CEO of Little League Baseball, wrote in The Wall Street Journal about a volunteer coach who was sued for pain, suffering, and punitive damages after one of his outfielders was beaned by a pop fly.  A Girl Scouts of America spokesperson told the newspaper that the Scouts must sell 87,000 boxes of cookies annually to pay liability premiums.  So far, the Clinton administration has no plan for major tort reform.  Some observers speculate that Clinton policy could be influenced by the fact that individual trial lawyers donated $470,000 to the president's 1992 primary campaign, according to a CNN report.  Trial lawyers, many of whom collect large percentages of tort case settlement fees, are strongly opposed to any caps on jury awards.<P>
 	The best hope for reversing the damage done by excess spending and regulatory programs is a fully informed citizenry which understands the true costs that regulations impose on their lives.  One of the first bills in the Contract with America to pass the new Congress was one to make it more difficult for Congress to impose unfunded mandates on states without careful economic-impact studies and guarantees of federal money to reimburse state costs.  President Clinton has signed this new law.  The unfunded mandates law should have the impact of slowing down thoughtless federal regulations.<P>
  	Other reforms on the GOP congressional agenda include tort reform, slowing the rate of yearly increases in spending, regulatory reform, property rights protections, pension reform, and returning powers and duties for certain programs back to the states.  When fully implemented, these reforms could move Cost of Government Day earlier in the year by several weeks.	A national consensus needs to determine how much of the fruits of our labor we are willing to surrender to support government.<P>

	<BOLD>We all know that federal, state, and local governments have grown much too large, too intrusive, and too costly. But you may not fully realize just how costly government  has become.<P>
	The average taxpayer works from January 1 to May 6 just to pay taxes. That's every penny we earn for over four months. Only then can we begin to keep money we earn to buy housing, food, and clothing to take care of our families.</BOLD><P>
	Direct taxes are only part of the problem.  When we add the regulatory burden on American businesses and individuals, the average American works until July 9 to pay both taxes and the true cost of regulations. <P>
	This is out of hand. Together, we can begin to turn America around and restore individual liberty, accountability, and responsibility.<P>
	On Nov. 8, 1994, exactly five years after the Berlin Wall fell, Americans rejected the costly failures that 40 years of extreme liberal policies in Congress had brought us.<P>
	Americans who had committed so much time, energy, and treasure to defeating Soviet imperialism, could now focus on repairing the damage that Imperial Washington has caused in their lives.  We have only just begun to turn the corner.<P>
	Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) works in cooperation with hundreds of state and local taxpayer groups to fight against any and all tax hikes.<P>
	Every year ATR asks all Members of Congress and candidates to sign the Taxpayer Protection Pledge committing lawmakers to oppose any and all income tax increases.  To date, 196 members of the House of Representatives and 30 members of the Senate have signed ATR's pledge.  Of the candidates for president:  Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, Robert Dornan, Lamar Alexander, Pat Buchanan,  Alan Keyes, and Arlen Specter have taken the pledge.  Bill Clinton, and Richard Lugar have refused to make this commitment to taxpayers.	ATR also works with state and local taxpayer groups to ask candidates for state legislatures to sign a State Taxpayer Protection Pledge against tax hikes.<P>
	Our goal is to stop tax increases.  This will force politicians to focus on cutting spending, eliminating programs, and returning resources to taxpayers who earn them.<P>
	This is a containment strategy against big government.  Just as the Soviet Empire was told it could not grow by conquest, so too must big government first be told it cannot grow unrestrained as a parasite on the economy.  It must be rolled back and once again become the people's servant, rather than a master.<P>
	 ATR looks forward to working with every taxpayer and every interested group to restrain oversized government.  Just as importantly, our affiliate, the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF),  sponsors research and education projects which help inform Americans about the true cost of government. <P>
	 As taxpayer advocate Howard Jarvis wrote, "Death and taxes may be inevitable, but being taxed to death is not"<P>
	As publisher, I take pride in welcoming you to this first issue of our new ATRF newspaper.   American Tax Reformer is dedicated to informing you about current issues in the tax reform movement.  Our goal is to distribute American Tax Reformer to an increasingly wider audience in the general public through libraries, universities, gift subscriptions for students, and other means.  In this way, we hope to fulfill the primary educational mission of the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation.  We hope you like this issue and that you will write us with your comments.<P>

<A NAME="Donuhue">	Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF) President Grover Norquist was a guest on Phil Donahue's TV show on May 26.  Norquist appeared with Richardson Foundation President Heather Higgins, former TV actor Ben Jones, and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) to discuss how Congress has changed under the new House Speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)<P>
	Jones, a frequent Gingrich political rival and critic, played the part of a Deputy Sheriff named "Cooter" on a 1980's TV series called <ADDRESS>The Dukes of Hazzard.</ADDRESS>  In the wide-ranging discussion, the usually boisterous Phil Donahue audience almost could not get a word in edgewise since the panelists' debate was so lively.<P>
	Hard and fast conclusions are hard to reach in the Donahue format, but few viewers were surprised to hear that Norquist and Higgins found great merit in the first 100 days of the Gingrich speakership whereas Rep. Frank and Ben Jones were quite grumpy about the direction of the new Congress.  Stay tuned.<P></a><CENTER><a href="/atr/bar4.map"><img src="/atr/bar4.gif" ismap border="0"></a>  </CENTER><p>



<FONT SIZE=+1><bold><a name="rock">  Rock the House!</a></center></bold><FONT></p>

	Early July marks the publication of Rock the House, a new book by ATRF President Grover G. Norquist which puts the 1994 elections under a microscope.  With an initial press run of one million copies, Rock the House is certain to become the definitive explanation of how the old Roosevelt Coalition unraveled and was replaced by a conservative coalition as the governing majority in America.<P>
	Norquist believes the Contract with America was central to what happened last November, and he sees it as a model for future politics in America.  The Contract produced an honest connection between campaign promises and policy fulfillment that is all too rare in any election.  People knew what they were voting for, and they now have a standard against which to measure the performance of the elected.<P>
	Rock the House examines the pluses and minuses of the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations and provides a road map for the future. Watch for Rock the House in bookstores this summer. Visa and Mastercard customers may call 1-800-201-7625 to order your copy for $9.65 plus $1.50 for shipping and handling.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><bold><a name="court">Court Blocks Term Limits</bold></FONT></a><p></center>

<p>
 	The U.S. Supreme Court decided on May 22 by a 5 to 4 decision that Arkansas and 22 other states could not limit the terms of members of Congress from those states.  Justice John Paul Stevens  wrote an 88-page opinion which devoted a great deal of space to the merits of term limits as a public policy.  That is somewhat unusual since the merits of the policy should not have been an issue before the court, only the power of the states to decide the policy for themselves.  In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas stated that the Constitution was silent on the question of whether or not states could determine limits for the terms of its members of the U.S. House and Senate.<P>
	The 22nd Amendment was passed by Congress in 1947 and ratified in 1951. Beginning with President Dwight Eisenhower, that amendment set a limit of two four-year terms for president.  Before that time, the Constitution was silent on limiting the president's term and every president except Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to seek no more than eight years in office.<P>
	The Supreme Court decision seems to close the door on all state and federal legislation on term limits which leaves a constitutional amendment as the only remaining option. A vote in the House in April to limit terms by constitutional amendment was part of the GOP Contract with America.  But backers failed by 61 votes to attain the necessary two-thirds majority.<P>
   		Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has stated the Senate will likely vote on a constitutional amendment this summer. Public opinion polls show 75 to 80 percent of Americans favor term limits.  The decision did not upset term limits for state and local offices.  National and state term limits organizations are planning now to make term limits an issue in the 1996 elections.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><BOLD><CENTER>Initiatives and Referenda</FONT></BOLD></CENTER><P>

	When Congress refuses to deal with an issue, activists often go to state legislatures to fight for change.  Welfare reform is an example of an issue ignored by Washington, D.C., and championed by state leaders like Gov. John Engler (R-Mich.), Gov. Tommy Thompson (R-Wisc.), and others.<P>
	But when Washington, D.C., and state capitals hide their heads in the sand or man the barricades in defense of the status quo, citizens in 24 states can turn to the initiative process.  Initiatives allow citizens to gather a specified number of signatures of voters on a petition to place a law or constitutional amendment on the state ballot.<P>
	This was the case when Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann placed Proposition 13 on the California ballot in June of 1978.  Proposition 13 cut property taxes in half and just as importantly required a two-thirds majority vote of the legislature to approve any state tax increase.  Other states followed with similar initiatives on the November 1978 ballot.  The subsequent success of taxpayer groups in using the initiative process helped to convince President Ronald Reagan to support the Kemp-Roth tax cut that eventually passed in 1981.  Thus local and state taxpayer groups started a tidal wave using the initiative process at the state level which also influenced federal legislation.<P>
	In 1990, the term limits movement began the long march through the states using the initiative process.  In spite of opinion polls which showed overwhelming public support for limits of six years for U.S. Representatives and 12 years for U.S. Senators, congressional leaders such as former House Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.) and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Maine) refused to allow a vote on term limits in either the House or Senate.  Worse, they used tax money to pay for attorneys who filed lawsuits against state term limit ballot questions.<P>
	Most members of state legislatures were usually no more enthusiastic than most members of Congress were about the move to limit their own terms of office.  But fortunately, the voters had one more option: the initiative process.<P>
	Success came in recent years when 21 states passed term limits with an average approval majority of 65 percent.  This groundswell created the right climate to persuade U.S. House Republican leaders that a promise to vote on a constitutional amendment to limit terms of lawmakers should be included in the "Contract with America."<P>
  	This spring, the first vote ever held on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to limit terms received support from a solid majority of House members, but less than the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution.  None of this could have happened unless the national organization called U.S. Term Limits had prepared the ground by leading fights at the state level using the initiative process.<P>
	Most recently, the drive to abolish affirmative action including racial quotas and set-asides in government contracts has been energized by backers of the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI).  CCRI supporters plan to place that initiative on the California ballot in 1996.  Supporters believe the CCRI is needed to strike down all government racial quotas and reintroduce employment and business opportunities where men and women may be judged by the merit of their qualifications and content of their character rather than the color of their skin.  Activists in Colorado and other states are exploring ways to copy the CCRI in their states.  For a copy of CCRI, call Kolt Jones in the ATR Washington, D.C., office at 202-785-0266.<P>

</CENTER></FONT></BOLD><P>
	Another major reform that is sweeping the nation through the initiative process is a requirement that legislatures may only approve tax increases by a super majority, not just a simple majority.  For example, in 1992 Arizona passed a requirement that any tax increase must receive the approval of two-thirds of both the state house and state senate.  In 1994, Nevada passed a similar two-thirds requirement with 79 percent of the vote.  That state will vote again on the measure since two separate votes of approval by the people are required in that state.<P>	
	Initiative supporters in Ohio, Florida, Montana, and other states are planning to sponsor ballot questions in November 1996 that would approve constitutional amendments to make it more difficult to raise taxes.  California may vote in March of 1996 on a measure to require either a two-thirds vote of the legislature or a two-thirds vote of the people for any tax increase to pass.<P>
	Americans for Tax Reform hosts a monthly conference call on the initiative process which includes leaders of state initiative measures.  The telephone discussion usually lasts for one hour and covers the progress of various state efforts.  If you know of an initiative or plan to sponsor one in your state, please call Kolt Jones at 202-785-0266 to learn more about how to participate in the conference call.<P>

Term Limits</CENTER></FONT></BOLD><P>


	Until the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its May 22 decision which banned state legislation imposing congressional term limits, many states had used the initiative process to place term limit questions on the ballot.<P>
	Before the decision, 21 states had passed congressional term limits by popular vote of the people, usually by overwhelming majorities.  One state that allows initiatives, Utah, passed the provision in the state legislature.  In early May, the New Hampshire legislature became the first assembly in a non-initiative state to pass congressional term limits.  The governor of New Hampshire signed the bill on May 15.<P>
	Almost before the ink was dry on the New Hampshire statute, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the laws of all 23 states which had acted to impose congressional term limits.  Before the decision, more than 90 percent of states which allow some kind of initiative or referendum process had adopted congressional term limits.<P>
	Currently, 20 states have passed measures which impose term limits on state legislators.  Limits on the terms of state officials will remain in force since they were not overturned by the Supreme Court decision which affects only congressional term limits.  This November, citizens of Mississippi will vote on an initiative that will place term limits on all state legislators and local elected officials.

	There are several different initiatives that have "responsibility" as their main message.  In the state of Ohio, Lee Donaho, Executive Director of the National Taxpayers Union of Ohio, has been working on an initiative that would force the legislature to require a three-fifths super majority to enact any new taxes or new tax increases.

Sunshine State Tax Cap</FONT></BOLD></CENTER><P>


	David Biddulph, President of the Florida Tax Cap Committee, has a similar initiative that requires two-thirds of the vote of the people to raise taxes.  Voting on your own tax increases?  Yes, 10 states now have the ability to say whether or not they will receive a tax increase.  People in these states can feel the difference too, the tax burden rose nearly 20 percent faster in states without a super majority to raise taxes.<P>
 	 Last year, the need for tax restraint was recognized, discussed, and fought for by the people.  The American people were given the chance to limit government, and they did.  Realizing the impact the I&R process could have, bureaucrats are making the initiative process more time-consuming, bureaucratic, expensive, and out of reach to many American citizens looking for the justice that the initiative process preserves elsewhere. <P>

	On May 9,  four incumbents on the Passaic, New Jersey, city council lost their seats to members of the Passaic Homeowners and Taxpayers Association.  The challengers signed a contract with the citizens of Passaic pledging a 20 percent reduction in taxes.<P>
	The contract contains 10 "common sense points" that will lessen the tax burden of the residents as well as improve the use of their tax money.  Included among these points are provisions to reduce taxes over a three year period (10 percent for FY 1996 and 5 percent for FY 1997 and 1998), reduce city spending to mirror tax decreases, and a freeze on unnecessary municipal hiring and pay increases without council review. <P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>J</FONT>ackie Gleason loved to tell a story about an old priest from a poor village in Ireland who had never before stayed in a hotel.  Invited to visit New York City for the first time in 1959 as the guest of a foundation, the priest checked in to the Waldorf Astoria.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> bell boy carried the clergyman's luggage to his room, opened the drapes, set out glasses and linen, hung clothes in the closet, and performed all manner of service.  Expecting a tip, as the young man started to leave he placed his hand palm up in front of the priest.  Unfamiliar with the gesture, the priest shook the bell boy's hand and thanked him heartily.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>"F</FONT>ather, you don't understand," the bell boy explained  "In this country, it's customary for guests to give us a tip."   The priest was embarrassed since he had no money, but he had an idea.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="capblue.gif"><br>
<A HREF="etaxho.html"> House List    </A>|<A HREF="etxsena.html">   Senate List</a>	<p>In a thick Irish brogue he asked,  "Tell me young man, do you ever drink?"<P></CENTER>

	<FONT SIZE=+2>"W</FONT>ell then," replied the priest, hoping to be of service,  "kneel down and bow your head while I give you the pledge."<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hen that priest was young, many men "took the pledge" to shun the excesses of alcohol.  Some took it often and just as often fell short of full compliance.  But the act itself was a sincere promise to try to do better, which is all anyone could ask.<P>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>ince 1986,<BOLD> Americans for Tax Reform (ATR)</BOLD> has encouraged candidates for Congress to take a different pledge.  This pledge requires lawmakers to promise they will shun another addiction common to government  -- that of overspending and excess taxation.  A similar pledge has been offered  to candidates for state legislatures since 1987.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>H</FONT>undreds of legislators have signed the ATR Pledge promising constituents to:<P><ADDRESS><CENTER> "Oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals or businesses;" <P><FONT SIZE=+2><BOLD><IMG SRC="ball_blu.gif">AND<IMG SRC="ball_blu.gif"></BOLD></FONT><P>
  "Oppose any further reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."<CENTER></ADDRESS><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he pledge plays an important part in many  campaigns.  Currently, 31  U.S. Senators and 196 House members have signed up.   Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Sen.

 <IMG ALIGN=TOPRIGHT SRC="wwwelf.gif">Father Robert Sirico<P>

	In Grand Rapids, Mich., the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty recently launched a one-year welfare reform program which includes four separate projects.  The first project was a highly successful conference held March 29 in Washington, D.C., attended by 200 welfare policy researchers and administrators.  Key speakers included House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Michigan Gov. John Engler (R), and Mayor Stephen Goldsmith (R) of Indianapolis, Ind.  Two other special Acton projects include welfare reform publications and a speaker's tour.<P>
	The fourth project is a national "better charity" competition to recognize "compassionate, effective, and innovative charitable programs."  Father Robert A. Sirico, president of the Acton Institute, announced in May the institute will award $40,000 in grants to individuals and organizations working to solve social and economic problems.<P>
	"Our Samaritan Awards are a way to honor the accomplishments of creative charities and share their techniques and know-how with others seeking to help the needy," said Fr. Sirico.  He noted that the ideal award-winning programs would be those that help individuals strengthen ties with their family, friends, and community and foster self-reliance and self-esteem by addressing both spiritual and material needs.<P>
	Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF) President Grover Norquist says he welcomes projects like the Acton Institute idea which look for practical solutions to the costly welfare state.  "It's not enough to oppose government-provided welfare systems, we need to find superior alternatives," said Norquist.<P>
	Three winning model programs will each be awarded $10,000 and there will be $1,000 awards for each of ten finalists.  The entry deadline for Samaritan Awards is July 15, 1995.  Applications and more information may be obtained by writing to The Acton Institute, 161 Ottawa Ave., N.W., Suite 301, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49503 or by calling the Institute at 616-454-3080.<P>  

Rabbi Daniel Lapin<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ww1.gif">
<p><p>Mazel Tov, Mr. Speaker 
	In January, Rabbi Daniel Lapin, president of Toward Tradition, met with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and came away heartened by the speaker's receptiveness to this fairly new organization's message: that new public policy initiatives need a moral grounding, which can be found in Scripture and in Jewish religious traditions.  Speaker Gingrich expressed the hope that more Jewish conservatives will take part in the political process.<P>
	Toward Tradition was founded in 1991.  Its membership includes both Jews and Christians who believe that the success of America's experiment in free government, in the service of a just and good society, depends on maintaining the strong foundation of values that are emphasized in the Judeo-Christian heritage.<P>
  	Rabbi Lapin says neither the Jewish community's spiritual heritage nor its practical interests are best served when the community is chiefly aligned with policies that push the excessive growth and power of government at the potential expense of personal freedom.  To emphasize this point, Toward Tradition took out an advertisement in The New York Times on December 16, 1994, which supported the Contract with America.<P>
	The ad was entitled,  "Mazel Tov, Speaker Gingrich -- We Know All About 10 Point Contracts."  <Address>Mazel tov </Address> is Hebrew for congratulations.  While the ad caused controversy in New York and even provoked responding counter advertisements from more liberal Jewish organizations, it nevertheless generated positive responses as well and focused attention on the Contract debate.  A framed copy of the advertisement now hangs in the speaker's office.<P>
	Since January, Rabbi Lapin has been busy on the lecture circuit talking about how spiritual heritage influences policy questions and is writing a new book.  In addition, he has become the regular host of the Monday night (9:00-11:00) talk show slot on radio station KVI in Seattle, Wash.<P>
  	Toward Tradition is planning a major poll of the American Jewish community to survey current attitudes on policy questions since the majorities in Congress changed in January.  It is also planning a second national conference.  Toward Tradition's first conference last October attracted 400 participants.  Organizers are planning for more than double that number this year.<P>
  	For more information, interested readers may write to Rabbi Daniel Lapin, President, Toward Tradition, P.O. Box 58, Mercer Island, Washington 98040. The telephone number is 206-236-3046 and the fax number is 206-236-3288.<P>
	Information may also be obtained from the California office at 110 Newport Center Drive, Suite 200, Newport Beach, California 92660.  Toward Tradition Vice President Michael Lapin's California telephone number is 714-644-0300 and his fax number is 714-644-2224.   Toward Tradition's Washington, D.C. office may be reached by calling Director of Development Yarden Weidenfeld at 202-872-8723. <P>

Subsidies Cost
</FONT></center></bold><HR NOSHADE SIZE=2 WIDTH=30%>


	ATR recently issued a list of corporate welfare spending programs and government subsidies that should be the first things on the chopping block when Congress pares down the budget.  Leading the list were a number of outdated energy programs that serve few people, yet cost us all dearly.   Direct and indirect subsidies to government-owned utilities alone cost American consumers billions of dollars annually.  ATR supports the elimination of the Department of Energy, privatization of the Power Marketing Administrations, and the elimination of the Rural Utilities Service.<P>
	ATR President Grover Norquist recently said, "We need to get government out of trying to run businesses.  Just look at the mess the government has made of the electric utility industry.  Directand indirect subsidies are taking close to $10 billion out of taxpayers' pockets annually and throwing them at government-owned electric utilities who also receive tax breaks.  At a time when all Americans have been forced to tighten their belts and Congress has to make tough decisions about the new budget, it is absurd to even consider continuing these wasteful spending programs.<P>
	"One of the things the government of Poland learned is that privately-run companies don't need subsidies and bailouts.  Bill Clinton's energy policies should learn from the failures in Eastern Europe, not emulate them.  It's time to privatize and get the government out of the energy business.  The government simply does not need to be in the electric utility industry -- either directly, through subsidies, or through special tax breaks.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="reptnote.gif"><P>

	One of the most widely read political columns in America is "Potomac Watch" by Paul A. Gigot in The Wall Street Journal.  When he isn't sparring with analyst Mark Shields on <ADDRESS>The McNeil/Lehrer News Hour,</ADDRESS> Gigot is spotting new trends and personalities.  Gigot's April 14 "Potomac Watch" column described the impact that ATR and ATR President Grover Norquist are having on Washington's agenda.<P>
  	Calling Norquist the "V.I. Lenin of the anti-tax movement," Gigot explains that while once candidates for president courted the endorsement of other major office holders, now they seek support from groups like ATR that emphasize communications with local cadres.  Gigot points out that Grover is a key organizer of meetings of many groups in what he calls the "Leave UsAlone" coalition that resists excessive federal intervention in American life.<P>
	"Real political clout rests with issue-driven activists who can mobilize grassroots networks."  Enter Mr. Network, Grover Norquist.<P>
 	"Mr. Norquist founded his group, Americans for Tax Reform, in 1985, and he now communicates with 1,800 state and local tax outfits."  Gigot point outs that Grover is a key organizer of meetings of many groups in what he calls the "Leave Us Alone" coalition that resists excessive federal intervention in American life.<P>
	"Mr. Norquist is the Grand Central Station of this coalition," writes Gigot.  He also points out that just before Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) announced for president, he started off his campaign by joining Grover Norquist for a photograph to sign the ATR Taxpayer Protection Pledge.<P>
	Well there you have it.  Gigot metaphors describe the ATR president as a deceased Bolshevik, a New York train station, and the bosses of Tammany Hall.  Not a bad combination.<P>

	The ultimate political trade publication in Washington is a slick magazine called Campaigns and Elections.  The May issue devotes one page to ATR's own fuzzy curmudgeon, describing Grover Norquist as one of the town's "Movers and Shakers."  The magazine asked Grover what he would do if he were president (of the country  that is - not just ATR) for one day.  Grover's reply:  "I would fire everybody in government and quit.  Then lock the doors to the White House and Congress, so no one could get back in."  Who says hyperbole can't make a legitimate and humorous point.  That is, if it was hyperbole.<P>

Judis titled "Newt's Gang."  Grover is flanked by a rogues' gallery of conservative policy strategists such as Heritage Foundation President Edwin Feulner, <ADDRESS>American Spectator</ADDRESS> publisher Emmet Tyrrell, and the CATO Institute President Ed Crane.  The subtitle of the article is "Meet the Real Establishment."  This group was not chosen for its snappy sartorial ensembles. That's why cinema heartthrob Mel Gibson is still on the cover.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>TV COVERS DAY OF OUTRAGE </FONT>
<P>

	ATR members and friends focused national TV attention on the burden of federal taxation on Saturday, April 15, during a rally across the street from the White House in LaFayette Park.  Speakers included Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) and the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF), Amy Moritz, President of The National Center for Policy Research; Dr. Marlo Lewis, Jr., Executive Director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute; Fran Smith, Executive Director of Consumer Alert; Jeffrey Pierce, Regulatory Analyst for Citizens for a Sound Economy; Peter Ferrara, Senior Fellow for the National Center for Policy Analysis; and Wes Anderson, former Executive Director of Frontiers of Freedom.<P>
	"This protest is for millions of taxpayers who are angry about high taxes, pork-barrel spending, and the growth of the federal bureaucracy," said Norquist.  The Washington, D.C., rally was one of several at sites around the country organized by taxpayer groups under the banner of "Day of Outrage."  Both CBS and CNN ran network stories that night.  More than 60 major net-work-affiliated TV stations as well as independents in major markets ran stories about the rally.<P>
	"We will be protesting, as our forefathers did in Boston Harbor, that runaway tax and spend government policies must stop now," Norquist said.<P>
	Dozens of protestors signalled their approval of remarks by blowing on plastic duck calls with a "no new taxes" slogan printed on each one.<P>
  	Both CBS and CNN ran network stories that night. More than 60 major network-affiliated TV stations as well as independents in major markets ran stories about the rally.  This level of coverage shows that ATR is taken seriously by major media.  Here is a partial list of broadcast reports in major cities which covered this significant ATR rally reaching tens of millions of viewers.  Broadcast times and content are confirmed by an independent report from Video Monitoring Services of America, Inc. for April 15, 1995.<P>

Flat Tax Alternative</FONT>
	Thank you for your prompt response to my request for information on the "flat tax" proposals.  It will help me answer and ask appropriate questions when dealing with neighbors, our local candidates, and radio talk show hosts.<P>
	Two reasons for my interest are:<P>
	1.  I am an American citizen paying taxes to a government which doesn't have a responsible attitude toward spending.<P>
	2.  I plan on starting a small home-based business and even though I am a bookkeeper, the tax laws are presently so confusing that I dread even thinking about April 15, 1996.<P>
	Your ideas are responsible and simplified.  I have contact with many people who would like to receive your "taxpayer action alerts."<P>

Editor's note:  Since this is the first issue of American Tax Reformer, we are printing here a few letters recently sent to staff in the Washington, D.C., office of Americans for Tax Reform.<P>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Reduce Super Waste</FONT>
<P>
	I have just finished Martin Gross's book "A Call for Revolution" and have run across your organization in a list in the appendix.<P>
	I was one of the citizens convinced of Washington's inefficiencies and excesses long before I read Mr. Gross's book, but I am now inspired to advocate the idea of practical steps towards rationalization and reduction of the super wasteful spending of our seemingly irresponsible governments.  I would welcome and hope to participate in the advocacy of every suggestion Mr. Gross makes, and hope that your organization may provide a channel for that endeavor.  Please be so kind as to send me whatever information you disseminate about your organization and a list of activities.  I would also like a history of your efforts if  you have one or a list of publications which can educate me concerning your public record.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Rock the House</FONT>
<P>

Grover Norquist's new book, <address>Rock the House</address>, is a lively, penetrating account of how the GOP triumphed last November, an election that dramatically underscored the desire of Americans for a fundamental break from the liberal/Beltway politics of the past 30 years.What helps make Norquist's chronicle so superb is that he was absolutely instrumental in helping bring about this positive, seismic shift.  Rarely has such a committed, brilliantly effective activist also possessed such a lively pen!<P>

	I am currently an assistant English teacher working for Saga Prefecture in southern Japan.  I am interested in learning more about your organization as I am concerned about the state of our nation (U.S.A.) and our growing national debt.  I would like to know what I can do to influence Congress from abroad, and also if I can organize fellow U.S. expatriates here in Japan to do the same.<P>
     I look forward to receiving information and advice from your group.  Thank you and please keep up this important work.<P>

	December 15, 1995 is the date for the Annual Meeting of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR).<P>
	Any member who wishes to nominate an individual to serve as a director of ATR should submit a nomination at least 60 days prior to that date.<P>
	As stated in the ATR bylaws, any nomination must be submitted in writing and signed by five nominators who are members in good standing of the association.<P>
	The nominee receiving the most votes of regular members voting shall be duly declared, elected, and installed as the regular-member class director.<P>

<h2>CPAC '97<br>
Twenty Four Years of Service to Conservative Principles</h2>
</center>

The "mainstream" of politics was a cliche -- much abused -- when in 1973 a handful of true believers in real values of America met in the Nation's capital. Their sole purpose was to affirm their support of the Conservative ideal. What they started -- with the first CPAC conference -- has become over the ensuing twenty-four years the <i>stellar</i> Conservative gathering of the year and one of the most important political events of both parties.<p>

CPAC is designed to advance important everyday issues such as taxes, crime, culture and foreign policy and to provide basic conservative viewpoints and solutions. CPAC '97 will be a three day event from Thursday, March 6, 1997 through Saturday, March 8, 1997 hosted at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C.. The conference is composed of speeches, forums and panel discussions from recognized leaders in this country and is sponsored by the American Conservative Union in conjunction with <i>Human Events</i> and over sixty other co-sponsors.<p>

Its mushrooming growth attests not that the "right" has moved "center" but that Conservatism is the true nucleus of American thought. We may attribute its "sudden popularity" to the excesses of liberalism over many a year and we wouldn't be wrong ... although it runs deeper than that. America, itself, was founded on the principle of Conservatism and has yearned to return to that basic philosophy.<p>

The spectacular growth of CPAC anbd now the celebration of it's twenty-forth anniversary isn't all that surprising. Twenty-four years ago it was warranted and timely and today it remains the same. It was anything but a temporary swing of the pendulum, rather, a steady course set -- strengthened and renewed with each year's growing power of CPAC.<p>

In 1997 -- our 24th Annual Conference opens within two months of what we expect will be a <i>new</i> amininistration. We hope for an administration that is founded on Conservative ideals not dominated by liberalism as in the past four years. However, what will really make this country prosper and stand for freedom is an enthusiastic commitment to a Conservative philosophy by the men and women who make service to the freedom of this country their life's goal. You can be a part of that commitment. Join us at CPAC '97!!<p>

<P>
<B>From:  David A. Keene, Chairman
<BR>
<B>American Conservative Union</FONT></B>
<P>
<I><B>Welcome to the Twenty-fourth Annual Conservative
Political Action Conference.</B></I> CPAC,
<B>The Voice of American Conservatism</B>, will be the first major
gathering of conservative thinkers after the 1996 election.  This
conference will be of utmost importance to everyone.  The election
itself confirmed that the people want to be represented by the
conservative ideology.  The President even presented himself as
conservative to insure his reelection.  This is the first time
in sixty years that a liberal president has been given a second
term of office.  It is very important that we stand strong and
fight hard to maintain our cherished conservative values.<BR>

<P>
CPAC '97 takes place at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in
Washington, D.C. March 6-8, 1997.  (There will be a congressional
Reception on Capitol Hill Wednesday, March 5, 1997 for those purchasing

In 1973, a handful of Americans met in Washington D.C. to affirm their support for Conservative ideals.  That first small gathering has blossomed into the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the largest annual gathering of conservative activists in America.
<P>
CPAC is designed to advance important everyday issues such as taxes, crime, culture and foreign policy and to provide basic conservative viewpoints and solutions.
<P>
Past speakers include President Ronald Reagan, President George Bush, Lamar Alexander, Dick Armey, Pat Buchanan, Bill Bennett, Dick Cheney, Bob Dole, Newt  Gingrich, Phil Gramm, Jesse Helms, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, G. Gorden Liddy, Trent Lott, Oliver North, P.J. O'Rourke, Dan Quayle, Pat Robertson, and Phyllis Schlafly, to name a few.
<P>
CPAC, a three day event, February 22nd, 23rd and 24th, 1996, will take place at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C.  The conference is composed of speeches, forums and panel discussions from recognized leaders.   It is sponsored by the American Conservative Union, in cooperation with the journals Human Events and <I> National Review </I>and co-sponsored by over 60 nationally known organizations.

<P>
From Newt Gingrich to Bob Dole to Phil Gramm to Patrick Buchanan and everyone in between, they all came to CPAC '95.
<P>
Some of the highlights included the first major speech given by former Vice President Dan Quayle following his decision not to run for President in 1996; a debate between Robert Novak and Sam Donaldson on the relevancy of the media; an analysis by House Majority Leader Newt Gingrich on the  Contract With America; a speech by Senator Phil Gramm on the balanced budget; a preview of the 2nd and 3rd 100 Days by Patrick Buchanan; as well as speeches by Jeane Kirkpatrick, Lamar Alexander, Congressman Istook, Governor John Engler, Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and many more.
<P>
The Presidential Banquet topped off the Conference with Ashbrook Award recipient, Malcolm Wallop, special guest Dick Armey and a keynote address by Bob Dole.
<P>
The Awards Banquet hosted Dave Thomas of Wendy's, Football Hall of Fame star Frank Gifford, and a special address by G. Gordon Liddy.
<P>
The activity did not end in the conference hall, the Exhibit Hall provided CPAC registrants the opportunity to discuss the latest social and economic issues with our 60-plus Co-Sponsors; to obtain the most current conservative books, brochures and newsletters; and to purchase the latest and greatest political memorabilia.

<B>Jack Kemp Returns!</B>
<P>
After taking a leave of absence to campaign as Bob Dole's vice-presidential running-mate,  
Empower America co-director Jack Kemp is now back with us.  Stay tuned to this site to see 
what ideas he will be putting on the table in the near future.
<P>
<B>Body Count</B>
<P>
Empower America co-director William J. Bennett has recently released his newest book, Body 
Count, which he co-authored with Professor John DiIulio and John Walters.   The book takes a 
look at the problem of crime in America, especially the prospect of a rising wave in violent 
crimes committed by juveniles.
<P>
<B>Issues</B>
<P>
We are currently improving our web site by creating an archive of various documents produced 
by Empower America.  The archive will be categorized by issue.  Several such issues are already 
up and running.  Click on the issues link in the left margin to see a list of choices.
<P>
<B>New Empower America Study</B>
<P>
On November 7, Empower America held a press conference on Capitol Hill to release a new 
study, In Defense of A Nation, on the contributions of immigrants to the U.S. military.  Look for 
a full text copy of the report to be up on this site soon.  In the meantime, check out what 
Empower America has had to say about immigration in the past.
<P>
<B>Press Conference</B>
<P>
Empower America co-directors Lamar Alexander, William J. Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin 
Weber, and Empower America board member Donald Rumsfeld were all assembled for a press 
conference on November 13th. See excerpts from their remarks on the future of conservatism in 
America.

<h3><I>Liberal Historians and the</I> New York Times <I>Deny Ronald Reagan His Due</I></h3>

<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i><br>
March-April 1997, Number 82</b>
</center><p>
<P>
<DD>
	<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>n December 15, 1996, the <I>New York Times Magazine</I> published  Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.'s recent survey of 32 historians and other "experts." He had asked them to rate every U.S. president as "great," "near great," "average," "below average," or "failure."

<P>
<DD>	Three presidents were ranked as "great": George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt. Six were rated "near great": Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Harry Truman.

<P>
<DD>	The most astonishing part of Schlesinger's poll was the low assessment his panel gave Bill Clinton's most illustrious recent predecessor: Ronald Reagan placed in the bottom half of the "average" category. Sharing this designation were Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, William Howard Taft, Chester A. Arthur, and Benjamin Harrison.
<P>
<DD>	To be sure, Reagan generated anything but a consensus among the judges. Seven rated him "near great," eleven saw him as "average," nine considered him "below average," and four graded him a "failure." Still, something is amiss in Reagan's overall grade. A close inspection of Schlesinger's panel invites suspicion that participants were selected as much for the conclusions they were likely to reach as for their scholarly credentials.

<P>
<DD>	Eminent presidential biographers Merrill D. Peterson (Jefferson), Robert V. Remini (Jackson), Arthur S. Link (Wilson), and Robert H. Ferrell (Truman) deservedly made the list. Authors sympathetic to the New Deal and its legacy, such as James MacGregor Burns, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Alan Brinkley, were represented in abundance. Also there were Lyndon Johnson enthusiast Robert Dallek and left-of-center historian Eric Foner. To top it off, the panel included two liberal Democratic politicians, former New York governor Mario Cuomo and former Illinois senator Paul Simon. Forrest McDonald was the only conservative scholar represented.

<P>
<DD><I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I> asked a number of leading authorities on the presidency whether they agreed with the Schlesinger panel's assessment of Reagan. Their answers follow.

<P>
<DD><B>William F. Buckley Jr.:</B> Reagan had the best intuitive sense of priorities of any president in the postwar period, when it became a constant struggle to know what to pay attention to. His designation of the Soviet Union as an "evil empire" froze the blood of international diplomacy, but agitated the moral imagination and did more to advance U.S. national objectives than a year's Pentagon spending. Speaking of which, Reagan was exactly correct in knowing that the resources of the U.S. could not be matched by those of the enemy. His willingness to install theater weapons in Europe, to explore anti-missile technology, and to commit great sums to defense effectively disarmed the potential aggressor. And then who, more resonantly than he, made the case against Big Government? Could he have known that a Democratic president, seven years after Reagan left office, would serve as an echo chamber on the matter of an end to Big Government?

<P>
<DD><B>A.M. Rosenthal:</B> There was a communist empire and it was evil. Ronald Reagan did as much as any leader in the world to help bring about the end of that empire. He also proved it false, as the Clinton administration now claims in the case of China, that struggling against a foreign dictatorship necessitates consigning to total isolation. President Reagan was able both to keep up the pressure on the Soviet Union militarily, economically, and politically and to maintain contact with its leaders because it was to their interest to do so. I think all this certainly raises Mr. Reagan to the status of above average.

<P>
<DD>		I think it is silly for contemporaries of a president to try to fit him into a permanent historical niche. I would expect that, as time went on, history, if not the historians, will judge him as near-great for his contribution to the downfall of the evil empire.

I mention just two: his crucial role in rebuilding American and Western military strength after a period of Western decline and Soviet expansion, and his great success in demonstrating the superiority of free markets and free societies over socialism -- especially, but not only, Marxist socialism. His leadership in these achievements strengthened peace and expanded freedom.

<P>
<DD><B>Michael Barone:</B> Reagan clearly deserves a rating of near-great. This is a president whose deliberate policies produced seven years of economic growth with low inflation after Democratic economists said that was impossible and won the Cold War when almost no one in either party believed that could happen. These were not just accidents. They were the intended results of policies adopted and supervised by Reagan personally, very often against the advice or attempted manipulation of his own advisers. Anyone who doubts that Reagan took charge on these issues should consult David Stockman's <I>The Triumph of Politics</I> on economics and Lou Cannon's <I>Reagan</I> and Don Oberdorfer's <I>The Turn</I> on policy toward Russia.

<P>
<DD><B>Forrest McDonald:</B> I was one of the 32 historians Schlesinger asked for a ranking, and I was one of the seven who ranked Reagan as near great.

<CENTER><HR WIDTH=50%></CENTER>
<P>
<DD><B>Martin Anderson:</B> One hundred years from now, when reasonably objective historians look back, they will rank Reagan as a great president, right up there with Washington, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. Why? Because, like those three, he presided over epochal changes: On Reagan's watch, the philosophical idea of communism went belly up, the Soviet empire collapsed, and the threat of global nuclear war vanished.

<CENTER><HR WIDTH=50%></CENTER>
<P>
<DD><B>Joshua Muravchik:</B> Just as a body of conservative opinion was unable to reconcile itself with "that man in the White House" (FDR), a mirror-image body of liberal opinion has treated Reagan in the same way, utterly blind to the greatness of his presidency, which deserves to be ranked with Roosevelt's. Never mind the accumulated federal debt, nor even the pathetic self-deception about trading arms for hostages. The big picture is that Reagan assumed office when America's Cold War strategy of containment was crumbling, and its morale and self-confidence was at a nadir. Reagan reversed all that and led us to victory over the mightiest foe we have ever faced.

<P>
<DD><B>George H. Nash:</B> As the 1980s recede into history, three achievements of Ronald Reagan loom larger. In a time of dangerous drift and malaise, he restored Americans' sense of self-confidence and greatness. He transmuted American conservatism from theory to practice, undermined the intellectual pretensions of long-regnant liberalism, and decisively shifted the paradigm of political discourse for the rest of the 20th century. Above all, he mobilized the resources -- rhetorical, military, and diplomatic -- that put Soviet communism on the road to extinction. As time passes, Reagan's stature rises -- a sure sign that he will be remembered as one of our most successful and important presidents.

<CENTER><HR WIDTH=50%></CENTER>
<P>
<DD><B>Alonzo L. Hamby:</B> In general, historians probably should abstain from ranking presidents elected during their adult lifetimes. They are, after all, no more exempt from ideological conviction and partisan inclination than the regular contributors to the New York Times op-ed page. In practice, however, none of us observe that rule, so here goes.

<P>
<DD>When passions cool after a generation or so, Ronald Reagan will be widely accepted by historians as a near-great chief executive. The faults of his presidency have been amply publicized. Supply-side economics was at best a partial success, because the president was better at talking about reducing government than actually accomplishing the goal; the result was a manageable but undeniably burdensome increase in the national debt. Americans, moreover, while not wanting a president to be a micromanager, generally expect a higher degree of engagement than Reagan demonstrated with many of the issues of his presidential tenure. Yet Reagan uplifted a depressed national spirit with his rhetoric, revived a sick economy, and established a policy course that won the Cold War. He may not end up on Mount Rushmore, but more than any other president since Truman, he will be a contender.

<center><h1>The Future of Conservatism</h1>
<p>
<H3>An Address<br>
by<br>
Malcolm Wallop</h3></center>
<p>

The future of conservatism, which seemed so clear and promising after
the 1994 elections, has been made dim and uncertain by the results of
the 1996 elections and even more so by the dismal campaign waged by Bob
Dole and Jack Kemp. While some conservatives may be approaching the next
few years fearfully, I believe that during the ferocious battles that
are sure to take place over President Clinton's conversion of power into
money, the conservative movement has a rare opportunity to instruct
itself and the country about the necessary consequences of discretionary
government power, and hence about the difference between government as
it has been practiced since the New Deal and the way of life established
by the Founding Fathers. The future of conservatism will depend in no
small part on what we do with this historic opportunity.<p>

In our time, government has become the main source of America's
troubles. It deprives us of freedom and self rule, makes us poorer, sows
strife among us, undermines our families, and debases our souls. Hence
my main theme is that the practical, everyday mission of American
conservatism must be to cut back the size and scope of government. But
before I consider conservatisms mission, two distinctions must be
made.<p>

First, we must be clear that conservatism and the Republican Party are
different and distinguishable. While the Republican Party may well deny
its birthright, conservatism is a permanent part of the American
landscape because the American people will always feel the need for
protection against the excesses of their leaders. Nowhere in the recent
lamentable campaign was this difference more noticeable than in
California, where the California Civil Rights Initiative, a basic
reaffirmation of equality before the law, withstood a titanic campaign
by proud, powerful, united left wing groups as well as by a thoroughly
split and embarrassed Democratic Party. It won by ten points while the
Republican candidate, down by double digits, waited until the final week
to associate himself with the issue, and then weakly.<p>

The Republican leadership's unwillingness to ride a horse that was
obviously heading for victory, a horse that was so rightly its own,
indicts its elementary political competence, as well as its commitment
to conservative principles. This was also all too clear with regard to
the rest of the so-called social issues. The political consultants of
the Washington Beltway who now have in their bank accounts the millions
contributed by the Republican rank and file, and the Warren Rudmans, the
Christine Whitmans, indeed the Alfonse D'Amatos and even the Jack Kemps
and Newt Gingriches, along with the Republican political committees, all
tacitly accepted the liberals' premise that the voters disapprove of the
conservative vision of American society. In their view, piety,
propriety, responsibility, standing for the rights of citizens and
families against bureaucratic encroachment are the hallmarks of
"extremism," and so the Republican leadership pressed upon candidates
nationwide an agenda best characterized as Rockefeller
Republicanismfiscal astringency combined with claims of superior
competence in management, and guilty protestations of "moderation."<p>

Meanwhile, President Clinton and the Democrats baldly cast themselves as
the defenders of families, religion, indeed of "our values" against dark
forces threatening them. According to exit polls, some 25 percent of
self-described conservatives and a big majority of self- described
moderates, most of whom share the cultural premises of conservatism,
voted for him. I stress that Clinton was able to occupy this
conservative ground only because the Republicans vacated it. The
cynically counterfeit character of Clintons appeal to cultural
conservatism could have been blasted away by a single picture of a
partial birth abortion, or by a pointed reference to Romer v. Evans, or
by a real commitment to tax reduction. But a Republican leadership
afraid of the California Civil Rights Initiative could not be expected
to take on such issues. Republican candidates prospered to the extent
that they disregarded the leadership's advice.<p>

Let me draw an even more important dimension of this distinction.
Compare if you will Bill Clinton's victory speech of 1996 with Richard
Nixons statement, after the 1968 election, "Watch what we do, not what
we say." Nixon was signaling none too subtly that he would give only lip
service to the conservative principles on which he had been elected, and
that in the substance of his decisions he would satisfy the liberal, big
government constituencieswhich in fact he did with decisions on
welfare, affirmative action, the environment, and court appointments for
which we are still paying today. But in 1996 Bill Clinton did the very
opposite. He gave his rhetoric to the opposition. For example, he spoke
passionately about school uniforms, something he can and will do nothing
about (nor should he), while quietly but tenaciously defending the
monopoly of the teacher's unions (the Democratic Party's most powerful
constituency) over most of American education. He spoke tearfully about
his devotion to families, while rewarding the sex education industry,
the entertainment industry, and the government workers of this country
in every practical way available to him. While Clintonian and Nixonian
duplicity are equally immoral, the Nixonian pragmatism of the Republican
establishment has the additional liability of being stupid.<p>

My second distinction concerns the self-definition of American
conservatism. The character of conservatism is not written in the stars.
It is subject to change for the better or the worse. It could just as
easily come to resemble the small and mean-minded thing we see nowadays
in Europe as it could the conservatism of Reagan, Goldwater, Coolidge,
Lincoln, Clay, the Adamses, and Washington.<p>

Lest I be mistaken as an uncritical admirer of California conservatives,
let me tell you how disappointed I was two years ago to watch the
success of an initiative that denied state services to illegal
immigrants. Proponents had an important pointthose who are here
illegally should have no lawful claim on any services. But few deny that
the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants sustain themselves by
hard work, and that thus they contribute more to the real economy than
they take from it. The real impetus behind the initiative lay in the
public's rightful frustration with the growing cost of social services.
But the harsh political fact is that by far the biggest share of those
costs is imposed by native-born Americans, by the recipients of benefits
and above all by providers of benefits. Anyone proposing to really cut
the cost of government must face the kind of vilification that the
Democrats visited on the Republicans in the latest campaign. Illegal
immigrants were by definition without political power, and hence were an
inviting target. Do not misunderstand me; I am not advocating opening
the borders, though it is true that if by a magic wand I could trade
domestic welfare addicts for foreign workers I would do it. My concern
is with the character of American conservatism. I know all too well that
in Europe conservatives long ago gave up the principled battle against
the welfare state, became just another set of claimants, and have taken
up the anti- immigrant cause, not without racism. If you want to see a
conservatism more niggardly and with less of a future than Nixon's,
Dole's, Pete Wilsons, or Christine Whitman's, just go to Europe.<p>

The American conservative tradition, which began with Washington and
Adams, is founded on a concern for character. No phrase came from
Washington more often than, "We have a national character to establish."
Following Aristotle, Cato the Elder, Livy, and Montesquieu, George
Washington repeated that the Republic could only be built on the firm
foundations of private morality. John Adams surveyed the world's peoples
and found that only in America were there the habits that had
undergirded freedom in a few ancient republics. The Founding Fathers
crafted our institutions, limited government foremost among them, to
encourage those habits. Abraham Lincolns chief objection to the
acceptance of slavery was precisely that it undermined such habits,
namely the expectation of human equality and the honor due to labor. Nor
can anyone read the writings of Calvin Coolidge without noting the same
sober faith, founded on the virtue of the American people, that had
characterized his illustrious predecessors. These and many other sources
of the American conservative tradition knew precisely what the habits
necessary to the health of the Republic were, and they crafted their
political careers to fostering them. The government established by the
Founders did not make us moral, but it took pains to be on the right
side of the great moral questions.<p>

That is why it hurts so to listen to the debased discourse of the last
two presidential campaigns. Trustees of the character of the world's
most virtuous people, a people whose ways have been under attack by
their own government, the leaders of the Republican Partya party whom
the American people by and large elected to stand on their side against
the forces of immoral big governmenthave trivialized the issues into
slogans such as "family values." Such slogans explain nothing, energize
no one, are easily co-opted, and quickly get the ridicule they deserve.
Truly, America is likelier to get family values at Wal-Mart than from a
Republican leadership unable to articulate just what they are and what
threatens them.<p>

Republicans did themselves and the country a disservice in 1996 by
talking about the "character issue" without ever mentioning Bill
Clintons specific misdeeds, and above all, without explaining what
about them is wrong. During the coming months, Kenneth Starr and the
grand jury will surely fill in some legal blanks. But they cannot make
the essential political point. The conversion of power into money, or
sex for that matter, is the inevitable result of big government. Big
government is inherently lawless because it necessarily runs on
discretionary power over people's lives. No scheme is conceivable that
could restrain any official entrusted with the power that Bill Clinton
had in Arkansas, or has in Washington. The moral of the story must be
that in America today there are literally thousands of officials with
such opportunities and that putting a few in jail now and again will not
stop our becoming a nation of insiders and aspiring insiders. Corruption
can be fought only by restricting the opportunities to profit from
it.<p>

Now to the main point: today government at all levels taxes, spends and
regulates roughly twice as much as when I grew up. It touches every
aspect of our lives and harms just about everything it touches. It will
fine you for not wearing a seat belt, but will not protect your life
from criminals. It will deliver contraceptives to your children, but
cannot deliver the mail. It prohibits a Jewish community in New York
from having a school districtwho knows what politically incorrect
things their kids might learn from reading the Bibleand it forces the
culture of abortion on the whole country. In the name of racial
equality, the government forces us to discriminate on the basis of race.
And in the name of environmental protection, the government orders
farmers to stop using their land to grow food.<p>

Once upon a time, our government was a bulwark against domestic enemies.
Now, big government has become our chief domestic enemy. Examples are
numerous, but one has only to look at the FBIonce the paragon of
American institutions, and now shamelessly political. Witness their
treatment of Richard Jewell in Atlanta, their illicit complicity in
seeking to frame employees of the White House travel office, and their
complicity in supplying 900 FBI files on political opponents of the
Democrats.<p>

This country was peaceful and secure not because the streets were
patrolled by government agents, but because citizens enforced high
standards of civil behavior, because citizens were armed and protected
their own property, and because local police were highly responsive to
the demands of local citizens. This country was wealthy not because of
its natural resources (the Indians had lived in violent
semi-starvation), nor because government gave us this or that, nor
because government forced wages up, nor because it granted privileges to
favorite companies. Americans created more wealth than the world had
ever known because government in America protected property rights more
zealously, taxed less, regulated less, and gave fewer privileges than
any other government in history.<p>

This country became a world power not because there are so many of us
(the Chinese are six times as numerous), or because we are so rich (the
European Union has a bigger economy), or because we have so many weapons
(Russia has more). Our numbers, our wealth, and our weapons became
military power because the American people are more patriotic and more
apt to think that we have a duty to do what is right and reasonable than
any other people in the world. And we became powerful because until
recently our leaders honored the American people's religion and
manlinesshow quaint that word sounds in the age of Clinton and
Gingrichand because they themselves served in the armed forces.<p>

With each passing year, however, this country resembles less and less
what the Founders left us and looks more and more like the countries our
immigrant forefathers tried to get away from. This is happening in large
part because the people who run our government, our universities, our
media, the entertainment industry, the arts, and so forth have used the
enormous powers of the U. S. government to make it happen.<p>

But why? What do they have against us?<p>

They think our patriotism is unsophisticated at best, and chauvinism at
worst. They thought our opposition to communism was dangerous and
anti-progressive. The current generation of American leaders thought
that we were on the wrong side in the Vietnam War. Military service is
the rare exception in the families of those who have the most to say
about putting Americans in harm's way. They clearly do not understand
the country they rule, but do not serve. They say that America is
nothing special, and that our troops ought to do the bidding of the
United Nations. Moreover, our patriotism exalts qualities that they
abhor: manliness, righteousness, the capacity to use force.<p>

They dislike the American people's prosperity. It is the policy of the
U. S. government that the American people consume too much of the
world's resources. But whether the excuse is the environment, or
poverty, or crime, the recipe is always the same: take money away from
independent working people and give it to the favorites of the governing
class. Of course, this is a recipe for economic decline. Let me remind
you that nowhere in the writings of the Founding Fathers is there
anything about "managing the economy." Our Founders wanted to promote
prosperity. So they set about ensuring that government would be small,
frugal, impartial, and moral. We became rich because government, in
Jeffersons words, would not "take from the mouth of labor the bread it
had earned." If we abandon the Founders' mores, no economic policy can
keep us out of the poorhouse.<p>

Our leaders dislike our tradition of self-government. They equate local
control of crime with brutality and racism. Local zoning is racism.
Local control of schools is racist. We are all racistsexcept they. They
have turned laws that prohibit racial discrimination into mandates for
racial preferences in everything from school admissions to congressional
districting, to hiring and firing and promotions, contracting, insurance
and lending. A whole industry has grown up to administer this American
form of apartheid. If you want your town or business to stay out of
trouble nowadays, you need highly paid, well-connected human relations
specialists. But in the end this has nothing to do with race and
everything to do with politics. The people who run this country are
still by and large white men, who are not about to give up their own
privileges to anybody. In the name of racial justice, and at the price
of racial harmony, they are increasing their own power to privilege
their friends at the expense of everyone else, and to diminish
competition for themselves.<p>

The people who run this country don't care about public safety. Having
made it very difficult for States and localities to police themselves,
having left ordinary citizens with no choice but to protect themselves
as best they can, the people who run this country are now trying to take
our guns away. In fact they blame us and our guns for crime. This is so
wrong that it cannot be an honest mistake.<p>

The people who run this country do not care that our children are being
diseducated, that schools are becoming factories of ignorance and decay.
Every proposal regarding education that has come out of the
establishment has called for more money. Over the past thirty years we
have tripled the amount of money that we pay to the public schools per
pupil, in real terms. And guess what? Not only has educational
performance dropped like a rock everywhere, but it dropped worst where
we spent most. The places where kids are not being hurt too badly, where
test scores are highest, are out in the sticksin places like Utah,
Iowa, and Wyoming, where the establishment has not yet been able fully
to implement its model. Maybe we hicks arent so stupid after all. But
the establishment continues to want money, tries to grab more control,
and keeps looking down on us.<p>

Above all, the people who run this country have deep contempt and enmity
for the culture on which it rests. They tell us we are zealots if we
talk about social issues like abortion, education, homosexuality, race
relations and the role of religion in public life. I say, what else is
worth talking about? They say, concentrate on the economy. But I repeat
the Founding Fathers' lesson: economic prosperity comes from the
morality and sense of responsibility of the population, as well as from
small government. It comes from the culture, not from recipes dreamed up
in government offices or think tanks. Try restoring a sense of personal
responsibility in this country while keeping it perfectly legal to trash
a baby you have conceived, or give it over to the state for safekeeping.
I think Lincoln would warn us against expecting that any sort of
prosperity, never mind decency, could be built on such views of
responsibility and human life. <p>

Again, can education serve even to turn out competent workers, never
mind decent citizens, if it continues to stress condoms over continence
and relativism over religion? And again, are we going to be healthy
economicallynever mind in other waysif our establishment keeps on
talking and spending as if "alternative families" and "alternative
lifestyles" were on the same moral plane as mom, dad and the kids? Not a
chance. It is all too easy to list the ways in which the U. S.
government is providing incentives to break up families, to put
generations and races at war with one another, to devalue honest work,
to dumb-down and coarsen children, for bureaucrats to seek their own
interest, for businesses to court regulators, to seek protection, and
the public be damned. It is also easy enough, as well as satisfying, to
discuss remedies for all these phenomena.<p>

We can and should end welfarenot "as we know it". Just end it, period.
Charity for those who deserve it is something with a long and honorable
history. But the short history of welfare tells us that it does no good,
only harm, and that the current touted reform bill has enough loopholes
that administrators and recipients will be able to do business pretty
much as before. We can and should eliminate Social Security and replace
it with private savings obviously people who are already retired should
get every penny already promised. But just imagine if every penny
deducted from us henceforth went into individual retirement accounts. We
could all look forward to a lot more money, and the government would
have a lot less to spend from day to day.<p>

For the monsters of Medicare and Medicaid, we can and should substitute
individual medical savings accounts backed up by vouchers.<p>

We can be rid of the monstrous educational establishment by giving
parents vouchers for whatever amount any level of government taxes them
to educate their children.<p>

We can be rid of the most noxious parts of the university world by
cutting all direct aid to higher education and substituting tuition
scholarships to individual students, which they must repay. Where this
scheme has been tried in Chile, students deserted rotten professors in
droves.<p>

We can re-establish the crucial line between what is mine or yours and
what is the governments by replacing the counter-productive Endangered
Species Act and other failed environmental laws with conservation
programs that do not violate the peoples rights to property. By
respecting property rights, we will actually do a better job of
protecting the environment because we will stop making enemies out of
Americas landowners.<p>

We can stop our tax system's pressure against families by increasing
deductions for children. Perhaps those moms who want to will be able to
raise their own children again. We can be rid of the terrible,
tyrannical bureaucracy of the IRS and of all the distorting inequities
and privileges of the system by simply instituting a flat tax.<p>

We can restore self-government by reducing the power of the federal
courts to review the acts of State courts and the enactments of State
legislatures. The Founding Fathers wrote Article 3, Section 2 of the
Constitution precisely to make sure that the judiciary would be, in
Alexander Hamilton's words, "the least dangerous branch." Now that the
courts have become a clear and present danger to our democracy, it is
time to use the Founders' remedy. Shrinking the government would yield
many specific benefits. But these are not the main reasons why we should
cut government.<p>

We want to cut taxes not primarily because doing so will put more money
in our pockets, but principally because it will put the means of freedom
in our hands. We want to cut the governments power to grant privilege,
not primarily because privilege is economically inefficient, but because
we dont want to be a nation of favor-seekers. We want to keep and bear
our guns not because we want to shoot somebody, but because we have an
irreducible right to take care of ourselves. Moral leadership, today as
in 1789, does not mean that the President of the United States forces
anyone to go to church or synagogue. But it does mean that by word and
deed he leads the country in giving unto God the things that are God's.
According to the current Supreme Court, Abraham Lincolns proclamation
of Thanksgiving Day would be unconstitutional. I say that Lincoln knew
better, and that recent Supreme Court decisions on religion, and on many
other matters, are unconstitutional.<p>

This country faces a choice between two radically opposed views of
itself and of the good life. On one side is the view many of us grew up
with, the view of the Founders, the way of life of most families in this
country. On the other is the view you can read in the pages of Time
magazine, the New York Times, and most of the rest of the prestige
press. This is the view that animates the U. S. government. The great
question of our time is whether government will continue to work against
the original American way of life, or will switch and support it as it
once did. The only possible way of enabling government to make this
switch, I think, is to cut it down to a small fraction of its current
size. Now, this is an issue that transcends parties. It is an issue
that, most likely, will cause a realignment of parties, or even the
death of one or both of our current parties and the birth of a new one.
All of that is not so important. The only important thing is that the
American people and the American way of life be defended against their
enemies, and that they be defended worthily. Conservatism could if only
conservatism would.<p>

<title>The Balanced Budget Amendment -- An Idea Whose Time Has Come</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p>
<center><h1>The Balanced Budget Amendment -- An Idea Whose Time Has Come</h1>
<p>
<H3>by<br>
J. Kenneth Blackwell<br>
Monday, January 13, 1996</h3></center>
<p>

Every generation or so, an idea which requires amendment or
reinterpretation of the Constitution comes along.<p>

Just over two hundred years ago, the idea was the Bill of Rights --
adopted to make sure American citizens would never be subject to
arbitrary federal intrusions on their liberty.<p>

In the aftermath of the Civil War, the idea was embodied in the 13th,
14th and 15th amendments -- abolishing slavery, conferring citizenship
and extending voting rights to a sizable and productive segment of our
society.<p>

In the first two decades of the twentieth century, the idea was women's
suffrage. In the middle decades, the idea was fulfilling the promises of
the 13th through 15th amendments.<p>

The idea now is the Balanced Budget amendment.<p>

In My American Journey, Colin Powell says correctly that the "great
domestic challenge of our time is to reconcile the necessity for fiscal
responsibility with the explosive growth in entitlement programs," and
that we have to face up to reducing the entitlement system or raise
taxes to pay for it. We cannot continue to pass on to "your children and
grandchildren the crushing debt that we are currently amassing as their
inheritance."<p>

Nobody these days is expressing much disagreement with the General's
point. Eliminating the deficit is the motherhood issue of the '90's.
Everybody is in favor of it. The question I ask opponents of a balanced
budget amendment is, if they are so in favor of motherhood, what do they
have against marriage. I.e., why should we not solemnize with a
constitutional contract our commitment to do what they agree must be
done about our spending?<p>

Two of William F. Buckley's current Firing Line series feature the
balanced budget amendment. I was part of the team supporting it; the
other side was led by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. I think most
observers would agree that nobody opposing the amendment is likely to
grasp and articulate the arguments more effectively than he, so it
follows for me that if his points can be addressed, the case for the
amendment is made.<p>

The Senator asserts we should not try to solve every political problem
by tinkering with the Constitution. True, but if it were not for some
tinkering in 1913, the Senator would now occupy his office only if he
were able to campaign as effectively among members of the upper house of
the New York legislature as he does among the state's registered voters.
We have been trying to fix the deficit problem with legislative action
for more than twenty years, but our legislative and executive branches
have not had the political will to get it done. Some political problems
can be solved only by amendment. The 17th Amendment was not tinkering,
and neither is the Balanced Budget amendment.<p>

The Senator noted that states have become dependent on federal monies,
and he asked what the impact of the amendment would be on Ohio. The
answer is it will be a $2.4 billion hit, or about eight percent of the
state's budget. Cutting spending enough to make up for this loss will
not be fun, but we are already making plans to do it, and other states
can do the same.<p>

Opponents say the federal budget is too complex, that a workable
amendment simply cannot be drafted. If they really believed that, we
would not be having this debate. The opponents would pass it, watch it
fall of its own weight, spread around the wreckage, and blame proponents
for a dumb plan. Forty-eight states have a working balanced budget
requirement. It is precisely because it can be made to work at the
federal level that they are so against it.<p>

Opponents say an ironclad amendment would leave us unable to come up
with funds to fight wars or recessions. One sentence from the 14th
amendment will dispose of this objection: "Congress may, by a vote of
two-thirds of each house, remove such a disability." And if two- thirds
of each house cannot be persuaded to agree, then maybe the bills for
such wars or economic problems are not ones we should leave for our
grandchildren.<p>

The historian Henry Brooks Adams wrote in 1907 in The Education of Henry
Adams that "Practical politics consists in ignoring facts."<p>

With the amendment, our elected representatives at the federal level
will have to choose between offending taxpayers by paying for programs
as we go or offending important constituencies by facing the fact that
we cannot afford their programs. With no amendment, our politicians can
meet the Adams test of practicality by continuing to ignore the fact
that their programs are affordable only if we stick generations to come
with the tab.<p>

The only salient questions about a Balanced Budget amendment have been
asked before in the context of all the other amendments.<p>

If not us, who? If not now, when?<p>

The questions are unanswerable for opponents of the amendment. For
proponents, the answers are clear: The who is us. And the time is
now.<p>

The Phillips Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to advance the cause of objective journalism in several ways, including this annual journalism fellowship.  The Foundation established this program to provide grants for projects to be undertaken by working print journalists who share the Foundation's mission to advance constitutional principles, a democratic society and a vibrant free enterprise system.  The Foundation awarded two fellowships in 1996:  a full-time fellowship to Stacy Mattingly for her proposal to write a book on a highly-charged school prayer case in northern Mississippi; and a part-time fellowship to Daniel Richardson to write a series of articles on the growing Patriot movement in America.
<p>
The three Trustees of the Phillips Foundation serve as judges for this annual competition.  The Trustees include:  Thomas L. Phillips, President and Chief Executive Officer of Phillips Publishing International, Inc.; Robert D. Novak, prominent national journalist and author of one of the longest running syndicated columns in the country; and Alfred S. Regnery, a Washington attorney and President of Regnery Publishing, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based book publishing firm.
<p>
The Foundation is looking for journalism projects which are both original and publishable.  The winning projects will be delivered in four installments with the potential to be published sequentially in a periodical or all together as a book.<p>

Applications are now being accepted for the 1997 Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship.  Applications must be postmarked by March 1, 1997. The winner will be announced on May 6, 1997 at an awards dinner in Washington, D.C.  The starting date for the fellowship will be September 1, 1997.  Applicants must be citizens of the United States.
<p>

    TO: MY DEMOCRAT FRIENDS <P>
    FROM: MARK F. (THOR) HEARNE, II<P>
    DATE: OCTOBER 11, 1996<P>
    RE: THE CASE FOR CHARACTER<P>
<P>
<blockquote>
"Bill Clinton would rather climb a tree to tell a lie than stand on the ground to tell the truth." So said an Arkansas official familiar with Clinton on CNN during the 1992 presidential campaign. Democratic Senator Bob Kerry has said, "Clinton is an unusually good liar. Unusually good. Do you realize that?" Senator Kerry did not make this observation during the heat of a primary battle but this past January in Esquire Magazine. Kerry is not only a Democratic Senator, but is also a leader of his party and Chairman of the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee. Senator Kerry knows whereof he speaks. 
<P>
Forget what this says about Clinton - what does it say about us. We are told that Clinton is leading by a significant margin in his campaign to be our next president. (51% to Dole's 38% according to last week's Wall Street Journal/ABC poll.) We are told that "character" does not count. We are told that a candidate's "personal life" has no relevance to the office of President and has no "traction" as a political issue. Indeed, we are even made to feel ashamed for raising the issue. (On July 15th Clinton said, "I think character is a legitimate issue and I look forward to having that discussion." But, whenever the issue of character is mentioned Clinton dodges the discussion by claiming any question about his character is a viscous, Republican-motivated "personal attack.") 
<P>
    Consider the current best seller list. A list which includes an astounding number of books about the
    corruption of the Clinton administration. Boy Clinton, Unlimited Access and Blood Sport are
    only a few. But let's concede Clinton the benefit of his denials and explanations. Taking only those facts Clinton has acknowledged, and even
    granting him his spin on these facts, Clinton is far and away the most dishonest president or presidential candidate in the history of our nation. 
<P>
    Let us assume that only 10% of what is reported about Bill Clinton is true. Assume that only 10% of the reports of drug use, rampant promiscuity, financial fraud,  and blatant violations of state and federal law are accurate. Assume only 10% of the Wall Street Journal's four year, two volume documentation of Whitewater, Travelgate and FBI Filegate is not innuendo and conjecture. Assume that Clinton's unlikely explanation of Whitewater is correct. (It wasn't a crooked deal to funnel taxpayer guaranteed funds from a Savings and Loan into his political campaign. Rather, we are told, Bill and Hillary, naive in matters of money -- notwithstanding Hillary's wildly successful commodities speculation -- were duped by the crafty McDougalls into a foolish real estate investment scheme funded by kited checks and illegal loans. Frankly, even if valid, I fail to find any comfort in this explanation. Do we want a sharp crook or a financially unsophisticated waif in charge of our national economy?) 
<P>
    Granted even these assumptions, impeachment should be likely, reelection unthinkable. Consider the following: 
<P>
        Richard Nixon's administration collapsed, Nixon resigned the presidency and Chuck Colson
        was jailed over misuse of only one FBI file and the related cover-up. By contrast, Clinton and
        Craig Livingstone spirited away the FBI files of their political opponents by the hundreds,  and the
        cover-up and stone-walling continues. 
<P>
        Spiro Agnew resigned the Vice-Presidency over charges of tax evasion stemming from
        $16,000 he accepted from contractors when he was Governor of Maryland. By contrast,
        Clinton has conceded that he filed misleading tax returns that did not properly disclose illegal
        loans made by a now-defunct S&L,  the proceeds of which were used in his campaign for
        Governor. The reason he was not charged with tax evasion was that he released the tax returns
        after the statute of limitations had expired. Equally well established is the fact that Hillary
        enjoyed more than $100,000 in "profits" from commodities trading orchestrated
        by Tyson Foods in exchange for favorable treatment accorded Tyson Foods by her husband, 
        then the Governor. 
<P>
        Gary Hart bowed out of the 1988 presidential race because of one wild weekend in the
        Bahamas and a sleep-over in Washington DC. By contrast, Clinton is being sued in federal
        court for enticing a young woman - against her wishes -- into his hotel room, dropping his
        trousers and suggesting she engage in a lurid sex act. Clinton's known sex-partners could form
        a single-file line longer than the inaugural parade route. (At least JFK was honest about his
        philandering. During a 1961 meeting in Bermuda with British Prime Minister Harold McMillian
        Kennedy said, "I wonder how it is with you, Harold? If I don't have a woman for three days, I get terrible headaches.") 
<P>
        Ginsburg is not a member of the US Supreme Court because he used marijuana during
        college. By contrast, during Clinton's term national drug use has doubled due to Clinton's
        eviscerating drug enforcement. Remember also Jocelyn Elders, Clinton's selection for Surgeon
        General. In addition to her crusade to distribute condoms (for which she earned the moniker
        "the Rubber Maid") and to have mast. taught in public schools, she campaigned for the
        legalization of drugs. During her term as Clinton's Surgeon General, Elders son was convicted
        of felony cocaine and crack distribution. (If she couldn't keep her own son from pushing
        crack, how could she be expected to reduce national drug use?) It is simply beyond belief
        that, with someone of Elder's views as his pick for the nation's chief medical officer, Clinton
        expects us to believe he truly wants to battle illegal drugs. 
<P>
        On a personal level Clinton acknowledges that he used marijuana but claims he "didn't inhale".
        Yet in an MTV interview with high school students Clinton states that if he had it do over again
        he, "probably should have inhaled." Roger Clinton described his brother's appetite for cocaine
        by stating, "He (Bill Clinton) has a nose like a Hoover." (Referring to the vacuum cleaner not
        the president who preceded Roosevelt.) But, we can discount this allegation because Roger
        Clinton, along with Friend Of Bill Dan Lasater, have been convicted of felony drug charges for
        the distribution of cocaine. 
<P>
    (As an entry for the "How'd They Do That" file consider this: Roger Clinton served only two years
    for his cocaine distribution charges and Dan Lasater served only six months. Roger cut a deal with
    the prosecutor to testify against Lasater. Lasater was convicted but pardoned by Governor Clinton.
    (Clinton says the pardon was so Lasater could qualify for a hunting license.) However, even as
    Lasater was being investigated for drug dealing Clinton's Arkansas Finance Authority awarded
    Lasater authority to underwrite a $30 million bond issue. An undertaking for which Lasater pocketed
    $750,000. The purpose of this bond issue for which the state of Arkansas awarded $750,000 to a
    drug dealer? An Arkansas state police communication facility. Clinton's pardon of Lasater raises an
    interesting point. Why won't Clinton promise to not pardon Susan McDougal (who is currently in jail
    because she refuses to testify about Clnton's role in the Whitewater scandal) and other Whitewater
    defendants? Clinton has already indicated a willingness to put the power of a presidential pardon to a
    personal purpose. Clinton has pardoned Jack Pakis a Hot Springs, Arkansas bookie and close friend
    of the Clinton family. 
<P>
    Given this, why is Clinton the favored candidate for president? Have our standards for the office of
    president fallen this far this fast? What does it say about us and our esteem for our nation that we
    would trust Bill Clinton with the United State of America. 
<P>
    A question should be asked of each vice-presidential candidate in the upcoming debate. "Would you
    want your daughter to marry a man with the personal character of your running mate?" Recall the
    question to Mike Dukakis about how he would view the death penalty if his wife Kitty was raped.
    Well, why not a similar question to Hillary. How would she feel if Chelsea brought home a boyfriend
    with the same character and integrity as Bill Clinton? (Some may be upset with me for bringing Hillary
    into the discussion. After all, they may retort, she is not running for office. Would it have been fair
    they ask to deny Lincoln the presidency because Mary Todd was a lunatic? To which I reply, Yes, if
    Lincoln had threatened to put Mary Todd in charge of the Union Army as Clinton tried to do with
    Hillary and health care.) 
<P>
    Two responses, and only two responses, are possible. One, all the charges against Clinton are false
    and Clinton is, in truth, a noble and honest - though much maligned - man. (This is the official White
    House position.) Two, the charges are, in whole or part, true but it just doesn't matter. Clinton's
    character is irrelevant to his fitness to serve as president. 
<P>
    If you opt for option number one, "Clinton is a wrongly- maligned honest man", than you probably
    also thought O.J. Simpson was framed. Haley Barber's line, "Clinton may not believe anything, but his
    friends have convictions - for bank fraud, embezzlement, conspiracy..." resonates because it is true. 
<P>
    Two-thirds of the Rose law firm, the source of Clinton's closest colleagues including his wife, are either dead under suspicious circumstances (Vince Foster), in jail after serving in the Clinton
    administration (Webster Hubble) or under indictment or investigation by a special prosecutor
    (William Kennedy). A similar fate has befallen many of Clinton's other top advisors. Housing
    Secretary Henry Cisneros and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy are currently subject to an independent counsel
    investigation; former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was a subject of an independent counsel
    investigation prior to his death; Clinton understudy and friend Arkansas Governor Guy Tucker and
    Clinton business partners Jim and Susan McDougal have been jailed for 24 count conviction for bank fraud and
    conspiracy. Clinton testified on behalf of the McDougals and Governor Tucker. After the trial, jurors
    told reporters that they did not believe Clinton's testimony and several jurors stated that, based upon
    the evidence they considered, Clinton was definitely involved in the wrongdoing. 
<P>
    It is simply not possible to consider the incredible number of Friends Of Bill who are under
    indictment, under investigation by independent counsel, in jail or awaiting sentencing and conclude
    that all the charges against Clinton are false. 
<P>
    Clinton apologists reply that it is unfair to paint Clinton with the same brush as his jailed colleagues.
    Democrat Senator Chris Dodd claims that to view Clinton in light of his friends is to engage in "guilt
    by association". These defenders argue that Clinton has just suffered the misfortune of being
    surrounded by dishonest people and is not, himself, dishonest. This explanation, even if credible, is of
    little comfort. Do we want as president a man so lacking in judgment that he has a profoundly
    uncanny ability to choose as his closest advisors a collection of crooks and felons. 
<P>
    Bluntly put, Bill Clinton is an unmitigated, dissembling liar. What Clinton says is meant to deceive not
    to inform. During an interview on September 23rd with PBS's Jim Lehrer Clinton said, "There is not
    a single solitary shred of evidence of anything dishonest that I have done in my public life." Most of us
    hearing this proclamation would understand it to be a blanket denial of any wrongdoing. Clinton
    clearly intended to communicate this understanding. However, reread Clinton's statement. "There is
    not a single solitary shred of evidence...." Clinton does not deny dishonestly, rather he denies that
    there is any evidence of his dishonesty. Quite a different proposition. Continuing with a further
    qualification Clinton said, "...that I have done in my public life." The injection of "public life" presumes
    a distinction with Clinton's private life. Given the mountainous evidence of Clinton's dishonestly, we
    can only conclude that Clinton believes using drugs, funding his Arkansas gubernatorial campaigns,
    funding his presidential campaign, managing the White House travel office and FBI files and
    formulating national policy are all part of his private life. 
<P>
    Option Two, "Clinton is dishonest but character doesn't count when choosing the President", is
    equally untenable. Consider the purpose of the election. For starters, this November we will decide
    who will take the constitutionally prescribed oath next January. A candidate for president does not
    become president by winning the election. The candidate must also take the oath of office and does
    not become president until he does so. (Recall the photograph of Lyndon Johnson taking the oath of
    office in Air Force One on the tarmac in Dallas standing next to a blood- splattered Jackie
    Kennedy.) 
<P>
    We do not make much of oaths now days. Yet, the men who crafted our form of government,
    founded our nation and authored the Constitution placed great significance on oaths and,
    correspondingly, the integrity of the individual taking the oath. A man's honesty and integrity were
    vitally important to our founding fathers. Thomas Jefferson, founder of the Democrat party, wrote,
    "We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor." Of what value is
    Bill Clinton's "sacred honor" and to what cause would he pledge it? (Obviously not his wife, nor his
    country when called to military service.) More importantly, would you believe him if he did? 
<P>
    This is a more troubling question for my principled liberal friends. (Especially for those who make so
    much of Republican scandals whether it be Watergate, Iran- Contra or the Teapot Dome.) The most
    outrageous Republican is a piker compared to the mythomaniacs, miscreants and poltroons which
    populate the Clinton administration. (Will someone please tell me George Stephanopoulos's job
    description and how whatever it is he does furthers the legitimate business of the presidency.) 
<P>
    Those Democrats who support Clinton (and their allies in the media who overlook the Clinton
    scandals) have lost the right to ever again mention Watergate, Iran-Contra or any other allegation of
    Republican corruption. 
<P>
    Most liberals acknowledge Clinton's fundamental dishonesty. However, they appear willing to
    tolerate or overlook his moral failings because they believe Clinton will advance a liberal ideology and
    Bob Dole will oppose the liberal's agenda. But, in choosing Clinton as their standard bearer, what are
    liberals saying about their own integrity and the validity of their ideology? 
<P>
    How can the noble ideals proffered by the liberal be reconciled with the tawdry and untrustworthy
    reputation of their candidate? What does is say about the validity of liberalism that the adherents
    chosen advocate is a consummate fraud? In choosing Clinton as their candidate (a candidate who
    liberals support because they believe he will govern with a liberal bent even though he publicly
    campaigns as a conservative) aren't liberals saying that their agenda is best advanced by disguising
    and concealing their ideology and, by implication, recognizing that if American voters truly
    appreciated the liberal agenda they will reject the ideology? 
<P>
    If I believed I had a worthy policy to advance I would not choose an unworthy spokesman to
    advance the policy lest the message be sullied by the messenger. If I was trying to sell a drug to cure
    cancer I wouldn't choose Jack Kevorkian to be my spokesman. 
<P>
    Indeed, Clinton's failure to keep the faith even with political bed-mates is why two high-ranking
    administration officials resigned when Clinton signed the Republican welfare reform bill that
    he had previously promised to veto. Abandoning Clinton is the only rational response available
    to honest liberals who truly believe in the merits of their ideology. 
<P>
        Others don't defend Clinton but disparage us.  They argue:
<P>
    "So what if Clinton lies, uses drugs and cheats on his spouse, most American's behave this way and it
    is hypocritical to hold a leader to a standard higher than the standard by which we measure our own
    behavior." 
<P>
    While I don't agree that Clinton's behavior is characteristic of the typical American, I will grant this
    point for the sake of argument. Granted even that assertion, I dispute the central premise. Americans
    aspire to greatness and have always been an optimistic people. Our leaders should be the best from
    among us not the worst. 
<P>
     The political results of a second Clinton term are certainly to be feared.  However, an even sadder result of a Clinton reelection would be that a majority of
    Americans would seem to believe that a man of Clinton's integrity is representative of the character of our nation. 
<P>
    It has been said that hypocrisy is vice's tribute to virtue. Well, if so, Clinton should be Master of
    Ceremonies for a Telethon for Virtue. Within hours of being elected president Clinton proclaimed
    that his administration would be the most ethical ever. This promise was made in the context of
    Clinton's campaign attacks upon the Bush administration that it claimed was unethical. 
    Clinton called attention to a State Department official who allegedly tried to pull Clinton's visa file to document Clinton's trip to the Soviet Union; a trip that was made while Clinton was leading anti-American rallies overseas. Clinton was "shocked" at the Bush campaign's "outrageous" use of official personnel and records to gain an advantage on a political adversary. Ironically,  Clinton can not understand why everyone seems so outraged by the hundreds of FBI files on Republican opponents that he and Craig
    Livingston had squirreled away in the White House. 
<P>
    What does it mean when the victor of this fall's campaign will take the oath of office to lead our
    nation into the next millennium? For me I want to believe the man who places his hand on the Bible
    and says, "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United
    States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
    States." 
<P>
    November 5th is national examination day. The question is one of character. Not Clinton's character
    but our character; our character as a nation and as individual voters. And, if the answer is Bill
    Clinton, we all fail.

<hr>
<P>
 After you finally completed your income tax return last April
and mailed it off, you may have needed to get away for a few days.
 So you may have decided to spend a few nights at your favorite
getaway.  What you probably didn't realize was how much you were
<a href="/atr/tax-presentation/hotloped.html">paying in taxes again</a> when you paid your hotel bill.
<P>
 The consumer generally must pay a state sales and use tax on
the hotel room of about 7%.  Local occupancy taxes charge another
6%.  This means the consumer directly pays at least 13% of the
cost of a hotel room in taxes.
<P>
 But that is just the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays to the hotel, the hotel must pay Federal income taxes, state
income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, sales taxes, capital gains
taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's compensation taxes,
business license taxes and fees, utility taxes, local property
taxes, and any local income taxes.  The hotel must also pay Federal
and state excise taxes on its telephones.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes average about 30% of the price of a hotel
room.  Counting the taxes paid directly by the consumer, this
means about 43% of what you pay for a hotel room goes to the government
in taxes rather than for the room.  Out of an average price for
hotel rooms of $80 per night, this means about $34.40 goes for
taxes.  Everything that goes into building and maintaining the
hotel room is paid for by the 57% of the rate charged to the consumer,
or about $45.60 on average, remaining after taxes are paid.
<P>
 A number of jurisdictions impose additional taxes on hotel guests
as well.  This includes a nightly utility tax, a liquor excise
tax, and a food and beverage tax.  A telephone excise tax is also
charged on the use of all phones.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.

<h2>Americans for Tax Reform's<br>
Taxpayer Protection Pledge</h2></center>

<center>[ <a href="pled926.html">104th Congress</a> | <a href="pled926b.html">Candidates</a> | <a href="/atr/pledge/statelst.html">State Organizers</a> | <a href="/atr/pledge/guide.html">Voter Guides</a> | <a href="plegfaq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> ]</center><p>

Candidates and elected officials began taking the pledge in 1986. After President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed,
many taxpayers feared that some politicians would raise income tax rates. With President Reagan's support and endorsement,
Americans for Tax Reform and a broad-based coalition of groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National
Federation of Independent Businesses and hundreds of taxpayer groups throughout the nation began to ask all candidates for
public office to "take the pledge." Every year, all Members of Congress are asked to take the pledge by Americans for Tax
Reform, and all challengers are asked to take the pledge during each election cycle. 



<P>
<blockquote><blockquote>     I, ________, pledge to the taxpayers of the _____ District of the State of _______, and to the American people that I will:<P>

     ONE, Oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and
<P>
     TWO, Oppose any further reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.<P>
<P>

<title>CLINTON'S LAND OF NEW PROMISE' MUST INCLUDE THE
UNBORN</title>
</head>

<body>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
JANUARY 21, 1997<br>
Contact: Jeff Hollingsworth<br>
(703) 836-8602<p>

<center>
<h2>CLINTON'S LAND OF NEW PROMISE' MUST INCLUDE THE
UNBORN;<br> MAKE ABORTION ON DEMAND A THING OF THE PAST,
ACU SAYS</h2>
</center>

<p>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "In his Inaugural address, President Clinton spoke optimistically of
America as a  land of new promise' as we approach the 21st Century. But if America is to
remain true to its heritage as the land where life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
are among the blessings of citizenship, it cannot remain the land of broken promises when it
comes to the right to life," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene.
<P>
     "The President claimed during his campaign that he is committed to making abortions
more rare in this country. He went so far as to buy political ad time on Christian radio
stations trying to make his case," Keene said. 
<P>
     "If the President would have us take him at face value, he must start translating words
into deeds, " Keene continued. "That means he should support rather than veto legislation
banning partial-birth abortions - - a practice so macabre that even many pro-abortion
supporters don't endorse it. If his Administration won't propose them, he should at least
support initiatives from Congress providing encouragement and additional incentives for
adoption. He should support private-sector projects and programs providing education and
counseling in support of the right to life and move away from those which push abortion as
the option of first resort.
<P>
<center>MORE. . .</center>
<P>
ACU, Page 2
<P>
     "In his Inaugural address on Monday, the President made unusually frequent references to
children and to future generations who will benefit from this  land of new promise,'" Keene
continued. "The striking irony is that his campaigns enjoyed the active support of the
abortion industry and its allies, and his Administration is the most avowedly pro-abortion
in history. He can't have it both ways. As long as abortion on demand is sanctioned by his
Administration, his lofty rhetoric about brighter days ahead for children and future
generations will ring hollow."
<P>
     On the eve of the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion, Keene called on Congress and the President to relegate
unrestricted abortion to the history books. 
<P>
     "If the President really wants us to believe he is pro-life, he could publicly reject the
flawed reasoning and faulty science upon which Roe vs. Wade rests and work with the Congress
to craft a human life amendment to the Constitution, " Keene concluded.         
<P>
     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a
wide range of issues before the Congress.

A Letter from Congressman Christopher Cox
 -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
From: Congressman Christopher Cox<p>


<p>
Dear Taxpayer:
<P>
Think back to last April 15, when you finally finished with another year's labor at the command of the IRS. Think about the scores of receipts, the paperwork nightmare, the headaches.
<P>
If you're like most Americans, you've probably fantasized more than once about life without the IRS.
<P>
But did the thought ever occur to you that you might live to see the end of the IRS? Could this actually happen?
<P>
Since last year, things have changed drastically in Washington. Ideas that weren't even on the table for the 40 years of Democrat control of Congress are suddenly achievable goals in our bold new agenda.
<P>
The most dramatic proposal of all is to abolish the IRS.
<P>
This is not an idle dream. It is a serious and sound reform, and I'm inviting you to join me in making it happen.
<P>
The liberal media are not reporting it, but already most of the Republican Congressional leadership favors either abolishing the IRS entirely or radically reforming it and reducing its power, its reach, its control over individual Americans.
<P>
These Republican leaders include Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott, Senator Dick Lugar, Senator Phil Gramm, and many others.
<P>
We have to be realistic about such a bold vision. It will be extremely difficult for Congress to muster the courage to actually vote to abolish the IRS until the members receive a clear signal from the American people.
<P>
That is why I need you to take a few minutes and do two things to help change our tax laws and reduce the size and intrusiveness of government:
<P><UL>
<LI>First, sign the enclosed petition to Congress.
<P>
<LI>Second, send a contribution of at least $10 or $15 to us immediately, and consider sending $25, $50 or $100 to help the American Conservative Union (ACU) fund this campaign to abolish the IRS.
</ul><P>
<p>
Our campaign cannot get off the ground without your support.
<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee recently held hearings that revealed some astonishing facts. We learned that the costs of complying with current income tax laws has ballooned to over $200 billion each and every year. We also learned that it takes over 14,700 pages of regulations and another 200,000 pages of interpretations of these regulatlons to explain our tax code.
<P>
It's no wonder that over half of America's taxpayers are now forced to hire accountants and lawyers to prepare their tax returns!
<P>
Think how much time, income and worry you would personally save if you didn't have to spend hundreds of hours or more during the coming year to be a bookkeeper for the government. Think of how much personal freedom and independence you would gain if the govermnent no longer forced you to record every detail of your flnancial life. Think of all the late evenings and weekends you could spend with your family, your friends, your work, and your community if they were no longer devoted to figuring out how much of your hard-earned money you have to send to the IRS!
<P>
Have you ever wondered how freedom-loving Americans surrendered so much liberty to the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.? In fact, it happened so gradually; we didn't object loudly enough, or in time. But the truth is, American life has changed dramatically--and for the worse--since the income tax started to take control of personal budgets and fueled the growth of the welfare state.
<P>
When I was growing up, in the 1950s, government did not consume the 40% of our gross domestic product (GDP) that it does today. In 1954, government consumed 20% of GDP. As a result, the average fanlily, making the average national income, paid income tax at the rate of two percent. Social Security taxes were juct one and one-half percent of wages.
<P>
I know, because my father earned just about the national "average" back then. Our family, like most others, could afford a 3 bedroom house, even though only one spouse worked. Mortgage rates averaged just 4 percent. Despite spending much more on national defense in the 1950s to defend against communism, the federal budget was balanced. In this low tax environment, people enjoyed steady gains in their standard of living.
<P>
That kind of freedom and opportunity can once again become a part of American life. But it will happen only if we are willing to reduce the size of government--and only if we recognize that the income tax in America has proven to be a miserable failure.
<P>
Do we have the vision to seize this opportunity?
<P>
As I said earlier, there is strong aupport in the new Congress to abolish the IRS. But Congress rarely acts before voters push them. Pollticians need to hear the persistent and insistent voice of the American people.
<P>
The American people, in turn, want a clear vision of a better life, in which individual opportunity and responsibility replace the failed welfare state. They want a government responsive to their concerns instead of those of bureaucrats. Abolishing the IRS is the central act that embodies that vision.
<P>
I can assure you personally that, for the first time in many years, Congress is really listening to the American people. I wouldn't have been able to write this letter a year ago, because I knew then that Congress wouldn't even think about abolishing the IRS and simplifying our tax system. For forty years, Congress had a vested interest in getting more of your money to fund pet projects of questionable value. But the world has changed.
<P>
The 1994 elections came as a wake up call even to my Democratic colleagues. As a result, congress is listening as never before, because people have joined together and are speaking out in a strong, united voice for many issues: reduced government regulation of individuals and businesses, 
 protection of private property, lower taxes and smaller government.
<P>
There are many groups organized at the local, state and national levels to fight for these issues. But there isn't the necessary organization to lead millions of taxpayers at both the local and national levels in the massive campaign needed to abolish the IRS and end the most noxious and offensive government excess of all.
<P>
That is why I've agreed to help the American Conservative Union give voice to the growing public demand for a simple, fairer tax system without the IRS.
<P>
There are already several proposals before the Congress that will move us toward our goal, including Majority Leader Dick Armey's proposal to replace the current income tax with a flat tax. With your help one of these significant income tax reform plans will pass. And every one of these reforms will help reduce the intrusion of the IRS into our daily lives.
<P>
Whatever path we choose, the ultimate objective must be to accomplish our vision of abolishing the IRS. For that to become a reality, we must begin working immediately. The day after last November's election, my good friend Bill Archer, the new Chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, shocked the Washington establishment by declaring that his number one goal is the total abolition of the income tax.
<P>
Chairman Archer is convinced that, to make this possible, we must get two-thirds of the congress to vote for a Constitutional Amendment to repeal the 16th Amendment, which established our current system of
income taxes. And then we must work to get three-fourths of the state legislatures to agree.
<P>
Once that happens, the income tax will no longer be a part of the U. S. Constitutlon, and the IRS wlll lose its reason for existence.
<P>
When we accomplish our goal of eliminating the IRS, we will have done more to accomplish the objectives of limited government than we ever imagined was possible.
<P>
I believe this historic effort cannot succeed without the leadership of the ACU.
<P>
For over 30 years the ACU has been America's largest and most effective grass roots organization working to lower taxes and greatly reduce the scope of government.
<P>
ACU was in the front ranks in l993 and 1994 with TV advertisements, direct mail, town hall meetings, press conferences, and other methods to organize and lead coalitions to stop the Clintons' socialized health plan.
<P>
But, I can assure you, that battle was nothing like the war it will take to abolish the IRS.
<P>
ACU Chairman David Keene tells me that a successful campaign will take about two years and a budget of at least $25,000,000 to repeal the 16th Amendment, abolish the IRS, and replace today's income tax with a tax that is smaller, simpler, and fairer.
<P>
Those of us in the Congressional leadership are working to build support for income tax repeal right now, but I have to tell you that our best chance will probably come after the next presidential and Congressional elections... If ACU starts our national crusade immediately!
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich is fond of saying that organizing a large number of people to solve a problem is a four-step process:
<P>
First, Establish the Vision. Our vision is an America of opportunity, liberty and personal responsibility, without the 
IRS and without the counterproductive income tax.
<p>
Second, Identify Your Goal. Our goal is the repeal of the 16th Amendment by 1997, and the ratification of repeal by the states by the end of l999.
<p>
Third, Define Your Strategy. our strategy is to raise $25,000,000 and use it to reach 100,000,000 taxpayers with our message. That message will encourage them, in turn, to urge their Congress and state legislators to support repeal of the 16th Amendment.
<P>
Fourth, Develop Appropriate Tactics. Our tactics are as follows:
<P>
<ul>
<LI> Establish ABOLISH THE IRS COMMITTEES around the country to coordinate grass roots activity.
<P>
<LI> Circulate petitions and obtain 20,000,000 signatures to abolish the IRS. 
<P>
<LI> Generate 45,000,000 letters and phone calls to members of Congress with our message.
<P>
<LI> Supply talk show hosts and other media outlets with information about the abuses regularly committed by the IRS.
<P>
<LI> Publish a special monthly newsletter for our activists and supporters.
<P>
<LI> Work toward getting both the Republican and Democratic parties to adopt a plank calling for repeal of the 16th Amendment as part of their 1996 electoral platforms.
<P>
<LI> Give every candidate running for President, Congress and state office in 1996 information on the need to abolish the IRS and repeal the 16th amendment.
<P>
</ul>
But ACU can't move forward with this program until you assure me of your support.
<P>
If you and others I am writing today do their part and send what they can afford, whether $15, $25, $50, $100 or more, ACU will be able to start this massive grass roots effort immediately.
<P>
It is also vital that YOU sign the enclosed petition.
<P>
After receiving your signed petition, ACU will advise your elected representatives in the U. S. Congress of your support for our mission.
<P>
We all understand how expensive this type of campaign is in today 's world. ACU will simply not be able to start this campaign and distribute our petitions unless we receive your financial support.
<P>
Our income tax system wastes hundreds of billions of your dollars each year that the government doesn't even receive in taxes. Government agents force us to work hundreds of hours a year keeping records, filling out complicated and unreadable forms, and answering harassing questions. We spend too much time and too such money in learning how to prevent the lRS from claiming money we've earned that isn't legally theirs.
<P>
Then, even after we have done all of this, we are forced to live in fear that the IRS will penalize us, or demand that we gather up years of our financial records for their inspection. If the IRS can find some mlnor error, they penalize us even further.
<P>
Is this any way for America to treat its citizens?
<P>
There is a better way for people to llve together in a free society. We have the vislon to take us toward this better path. He can live without the IRS and without the 16th Amendment.
<P>
So, please take a few minutes right now and return your signed petition and a generous contribution to help launch a massive, grass-roots lobbying campaign to abolish the IRS and replace it with a smaller, simpler, and fairer tax system.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>

Christopher Cox
<P>
Chairman<br>
House Republican Policy Committee<br>
<P>

P. S. Your signed petition will help 
convince Members of Congress to repeal the 16th Amendment, to abolish the IRS and its more than 14,000 pages of complicated and outrageous rules and regulations, and to dismiss the 115,000 IRS employees that cause Americans to live in fear of their own government.
<P>
In order for this to happen, ACU needs you to send a contribution today of at least $15. If at all possible, please send as much as you feel it would be <u>worth to you</u> to abolish the IRS. Send $25, $50, or $100 If you can only afford $10 or $15, that will be extremely helpful and allow ACU to spring into action with their battle plan to repeal the 16th Amendment by 1997.

<P>
<I>Statement Of Principles </I>
 <P>
We believe that the Constitution of the United States is the best political  
charter yet created by men for governing themselves. It is our belief that  
the Constitution is designed to guarantee the free exercise of the inherent  
rights of the individual through strictly limiting the power of  
government. 
 <P>
We reaffirm our belief in the Declaration of Independence, and in  
particular the belief that our inherent rights are endowed by the Creator.  
We further believe that our liberties can remain secure only if  
government is so limited that it cannot infringe upon those rights. 
 <P>
We believe that capitalism is the only economic system of our time that is  
compatible with political liberty. It has not only brought a higher standard  
of living to a greater number of people than any other economic system  
in the history of mankind; more important, it has been a decisive  
instrument in preserving freedom through maintaining private control of  
economic power and thus limiting the power of government. 
 <P>
We believe that collectivism and capitalism are incompatible, and that  
when government competes with capitalism, it jeopardizes the natural  
economic growth of our society and the well-being and freedom of the  
citizenry. 
 <P>

 <P>
We believe that it is the responsibility of the individual citizen, whenever  
his inherent rights are threatened from within or without, to join together  
with other individuals to protect these rights, or, when they have been  
temporarily lost, to regain them. 
 <P>
We believe that any responsible conservative organization must conduct  
itself within the framework of the Constitution; in pursuance of this belief  
we refuse to countenance any actions which conflict in any way with the  
traditions of the American political system. 
 <P>
The American Conservative Union is created to realize these ends  
through the cooperation in responsible political action, of all Americans  
who cherish the principles upon which the Republic was founded. 
 <P>
The American Conservative Union will welcome all Americans who are  
prepared to fight for the realization and preservation of these principles  
through political action at the local, state and national level. 
 <P>
                -- Adopted December, 1964

<title>ABIC - Term Limits To Be First Item of Business in New GOP-led Congress</title>

<h3>Speaker Promises to Make Term Limits
the First Item of Business<br>if the
GOP Retains Control of the House
<p>
</h3></center>
<p>
<i>This is the speech given by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on March 29, 1995 in the closing moments of the House Term Limits debate.  In it, the Speaker promises to make the Term Limits Amendment the first item of business, H.J.Res. 1, in the new Congress if the Republicans maintain control of the House.</i>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
I listened with great fascination to the extraordinarily articulate gentleman from Massachusetts (Rep. Barney Frank-D), and I tried to remember back to the platonic concern about the ability of one to argue any side of a question with equal facility. I looked up the word `sophistry'. 
<p>
A subtle, tricky, superficially plausible but generally fallacious method of reasoning. 
<p>
And I realized that speed of language is not the same as wisdom. Let me give just a few examples. 
<p>
This amendment does not preempt the States. It sets a cap. The Supreme Court will decide what that cap means, but the cap is not in any way worded to be binding and, in fact, in no way would change any of the current relationship of the States to their ability to do what they wish to do. 
<p>
I can assure the House that if the Supreme Court rules later on this year that the Congress need act, that we will visit that question and it may well be on a legislative rather than constitutional basis which will take 218 and not 290 votes. 
<p>
Let me say second that I believe this is a historic vote. I have been frankly surprised by our friends on the left. I would have thought, having been defeated last fall for the first time in 40 years, that paying some attention to the American people would have been useful. 
<p>
But I will tell you where I think we are historically. This is not a new experience in America. In the late 19th century, a radical idea emerged, that Senators should be elected by popular vote, that State legislatures should no longer select the Senators. This was a change in the Constitution, an effort to take power away from professional politicians, the State legislature, and return it to the people. 
<p>
It took about 20 years for the idea to permeate Washington. But in that 20-year period, it became obvious and even the most entrenched old-time political machine came to realize that in fact there was no alternative. 
<p>
I think term limits is a very similar pattern to the election of U.S. Senators. When it first came up, I rejected it. I am troubled by it. I think in some ways it is anti-democratic. I think that part of the argument is fair. On the other hand, from city council to county commission, to school board, to State legislature, to governor, to the Congress, everywhere in America the people say they are sick of the professional politicians, they are tired of
those who use the taxpayers' money to stay entrenched, and they want to find a device to take power back from the professional political class. They say it in New York City, they say it in Los Angeles. They say it in Idaho, they say it in Florida. Everywhere in America. 
<p>
Now, we are being visited tonight by the fifth grade from Cliffside School in Rutherford County, North Carolina. I would bet a great deal of money that by the time they are old enough to vote, we will have passed term limits, because in the end, the will of the American people is sovereign, no matter how much sophistry, and no matter how many reservations. The fact is that if over time in State after State in county after county the American people say this is an experiment they are willing to risk, sooner or later they will get their way. 
<p>
One of our good friends the gentleman from Montana got up and said. `This is the sound of the Contract dying.' Let me tell you, my friend, tonight 85 percent or more of the Republican Party will vote with the American people for term limits. My guess is tonight 60 to 70 percent of the Democratic party will vote against the American people and against term limits. We will go to the country in 1996 with a simple pledge. It will be a new version of the contract. We are not going to have one of these between now and 1997, but a new version. It will say H.J.Res. 1, Term Limits, will be voted on as the first item in the new Congress if we are the majority. 
<p>
The Democratic Party has it in its power tonight, if half the Democrats, only half, vote with 85 percent of the Republicans, term limits will pass tonight. It will take deliberate decision of the Democratic Party to deny the American people an opportunity, and we are not even fully passing it, we just send it to the Senate, then the Senate has to send it to the States. 
<p>
We are not afraid to allow the American people to have a chance in their State legislatures to render judgment. We are not afraid to allow the Senate to look at this amendment. But I can promise you, if the Democratic Party tonight defeats term limits, the Contract may have been postponed in one of its 10 items, but it will be back and when we have picked up enough additional seats in 1996, we will pass it as H.J.Res. 1 in 1997.

<h2>Term Limits Questions and Answers</h2>
</center>
<br>
Term Limits opponents often tend to ask the same questions over and over again.  ABIC has developed this page to help set aside some of the anti-term limit myths once and for all.  Below, you'll find some of the most frequently asked questions by opponents and our responses.  If you have any questions about this issue, please feel free to e-mail us and we'll try to answer your question, too!<p>
<br>
<b><i>"With congressional term limits, wouldn't we lose all that experience?"</b></i>
<p>
First of all, what has all that experience gotten us?  A huge federal deficit.  A spiraling federal debt.  Budget bills with little pork-barrel spending items that their sponsors know wouldn't pass on their own.  And a federal bureaucracy and a set of regulations that aren't serving the people and issues they were set up to serve.
<p>
Second, sure we have lots of members who have years of experience in that office.  But how many insightful intellects and energetic hearts have we lost because the process is so closed?  Who in his or her right mind would run against a 15- or 30-year incumbent?  Is Henry Hyde really the only person from north Chicago who can serve that constituency?  Is Vic Fazio really the only person in Sacramento qualified to serve the citizens of his district in the national legislature?  And if that expericnce is so wonderful, who's to say that it can't be used in another office, perhaps the other chamber of Congress or a statewide seat or the state legislature or even in the federal executive branch?
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"We have term limits--they are called elections."</b></i>
<p>
This assumes that today's elections are 100% open and fair, giving voters true choices.  Americans inside and outside the beltway know that the current electoral process is incredibly skewed toward the incumbent.  The financial and other advantages available to incumbents grossly tip the playing field toward incumbents, making it virtually impossible to have truly competitive electoral races.  The point of term limits is to open up the process.  Term limits will create more <i>open</i> and <i>fair</i> elections. 
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"What we really need is serious campaign finance reform."</b></i>
<p>
Everyone agrees that campaign finance reform is needed.  But that alone won't do it.  And no one believes that politicians will pass a law which makes it harder for them to win their elections.
<p>
There are several problems with some of the campaign finance reform ideas:  if you set a spending limit (the idea most discussed in political circles), instead of hurting the incumbent or even leveling the playing field, this actually helps the incumbent.  A challenger has to spend more than an incumbent just to break even: the incumbent already has much more name recognition, a franking ability, and so on.  Incumbents spend years serving their constituents.  When there's a flood, the local media interviews the congressman, senator and local officials to see what they are doing to help.  And so on.  The member communicates every so often with constituents to let them know what he/she is doing.  To a certain extent, this is part of the process of governing.  But it does give the incumbent an advantage that the challenger must overcome.  And spending limits will only hurt the challenger.
<p>
There is an interesting anecdote which illustrates this: Rep. Bob Inglis (R-SC) tells the story of his first campaign for the U.S. House in 1992.  Running against an incumbent, he was faced with all sorts of problems unique to challengers.  While the incumbent was invited to factory after factory, workplace after workplace, event after event, his campaign had to bite, pinch, scream, and kick to get invited to <i>one</i> factory.  Now he's invited to factories and workplaces all the time.  When he was running as a challenger, he had to spend his nights working at his law practice to keep his billable hours up to support his family while he campaigned during the day.  Meanwhile, his incumbent opponent was given a month's <i>recess</i> to come home and campaign <i>full-time</i>.
<p>
How does campaign finance reform help any of this?  We need <i>both</i> term limits and some <i>real</i> campaign finance reform.  And we won't get the latter without first having the former.
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"The 1994 elections proved that we don't need term limits."</b></i>
<p>
In the "revolutionary" 1994 elections, 90% of those incumbents who ran won.  In 1996, the rate was 95%.  The message to incumbents is: if you run, you have better than a 9 in 10 chance of winning.  The message to potential challengers is: if you run, you have less than a 1 in 10 chance--pretty poor odds if you're thinking about running for Congress against an incumbent.  Term limits are necessary to even the playing field.
<p>
<center>* * *</center><br>
<p>
The bottom line is that term limits will open up a process which is currently closed to average American citizens.  For example, in the current 105th Congress, 70% of the women serving in the House of Representatives were elected in open seats.  And 83% of the minorities in the House were elected in open seats.  Creating more open seats creates more opportunities for <i>all</i> Americans to participate in their democratic process and makes our federal government less responsive to the needs of inside-the-Beltway special interests and more responsive to the needs of everyday Americans.

<title>ABIC - Demographic Breakdown of American Support for TL</title>

<img src="/abic/images/demograp.gif" border="0" ALT="Chart: Demographic Breakdown of American Support for Term Limits">
</center>
<p>
<br>

In the first House floor vote on term limits, 82% of the Republicans voted <i>yes</i>.  Conversely, 82% of the Democrats voted <i>no</i>.
<p>
These numbers are even more significant when viewed in light of the wishes of the American people.  In January 1996, the Tarrance Group conducted a national poll of registered voters on behalf of the Term Limits Amendment National Campaign.  According to the data, 77% of the American people favor term limits while only 17% oppose the idea.  Of those, 59% <i>strongly</i> favor term limits while only 9% strongly oppose it. (See <a href="/abic/peoplepie.html.cgi">chart</a>.)
<p>
But most importantly, when broken into demographic groups, every group supports congressional term limits, including Conservative Democrats (who support the issue by an <b>80%</b> margin) and even Moderate and Liberal Democrats (65%)!  This means that the House Democrats were not just voting against the wishes of the American people as a whole, <i>they were voting against the wishes of their own voters!</i>

The "EZ" Reference Guide to the House Term Limits Vote</h2></center>
<p>
There is an easy way to remember who the good guys and the bad guys are in the House of Representatives on the issue of term limits:
<p>
There are 35 Democrats who voted "yes".<br>
There are 39 Republicans who voted "no" (or "present").<br>
<p>
All other Democrats are bad on the issue.<br>
All other Republicans are good on the issue.<br>
<p>
If your Congressman is a Democrat whose name is on the list, he or she is a good guy.<br>
If your Congressman is a Republican whose name is on the list, he or she is a bad guy.<br>
<p>
Check the lists for EZ reference.

Source: "Corporate Welfare Reform?", Janice C. Shields and James M. Sheehan, <a href="http://www.washtimes.com">Washington Times</a>, P. A17, September 4, 1996.
<p>
<i>Excerpts from the Washington Times piece:</i>
<p>
The Federal Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) "doles out corporate welfare through direct loans, loan guarantees and political risk insurance...
<p>
OPIC's welfare for multinational corporations can be very costly.  As of Sept. 30, 1995, the agency reported more than $4 billion in outstanding loan guarantees and $10 billion in outstanding insurance.  OPIC estimates that $14.6 million of its outstanding direct loans won't be repaid.  In the event that borrowers default on the direct or guaranteed loans, the ultimate risk is borne by the U.S. government (read: "taxpayers").
<p>
To balance the federal budget and downsize government, Congress claims to be scaling back wasteful spending programs and eliminating others.  No so for corporate pork, which has somehow survived the cuts and will even grow faster.  The bill to reauthorize OPIC through the year 2001 nearly doubles the ceiling on OPIC's investment insurance to $25 billion, and more than doubles OPIC's financing authority to $20 billion."

<H3>"The Mysterious Disappearance of the Metcalf Amendment:<BR>
<EM>A True Life Congressional Thriller</EM>. . .</H3>
<P>
<b>Chapter 3</b>
<P>
The Metcalf Amendment Reappears...<br>
....as the Thompson Amendment!!
</center><p>
In Chapters 1 and 2, we learned that ABIC has been following the disappearance of the so-called Metcalf Amendment. In July, we pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
We also learned that when the bill came out of the Senate committee, the Metcalf amendment had <b><i>vanished without a trace</i></b>.  No one knew how it disappeared or whodunnit! In <a href="/abic/ptf/7-29-96.html.cgi">Chapter 1</a>, ABIC pointed the finger at the prime suspects.
<P>
While no amount of detective work will reveal how the Metcalf Amendment disappeared in the Committee, <b>the day was ultimately saved by none other than...<P>
<center><h3>Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN)!</b></h3></center>
<P>

Charles Grassley</b> (R-IA), <b>sponsored an amendment on the floor of the Senate which would do the exact same thing as the Metcalf Amendment.</b> It would stop the automatic congressional payraise!<p>

<P>
In his floor statement, Sen. Thompson said, "The amendment we offer today is based upon the simple proposition that while we are asking the American people to make these (sacrifices), we must ask the same of ourselves...  We need to lead by example by showing the American people that we in Congress are willing to make a personal contribution to the effort of balancing the budget."
<P>
In short order, the Amendment passed the full Senate with a voice vote.  So now that both the House and the Senate have passed this measure, it is now very likely that it will clear the conference committee and become law.<p>
So, this week ABIC points the finger at a group of <i><b>good</i></b> guys: the six co-sponsors of the Thompson Amendment.

</tr>
</table>
In a classic story of unrestrained government, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) has finally apologized to an elderly Maine couple for illegally seizing their retirement "nest egg" property.  In a July letter, ACE admitted that Corps officials "were clearly guilty of innappropriate behavior in (this) case."
<P>
After 10 years of legal wrangling in which ACE claimed that the property was a protected wetland, even though it was surrounded by a road, railroad tracks and houses, the Corps finally settled a lawsuit filed by the couple, the Roberges.  Worse, during the course of the lawsuit, the Roberges' attorneys discovered a memo signed by an ACE caseworker, Jay Clement, in which he stated, <STRONG>"Roberge would be a good one to squash and (make into) an example."  </STRONG>Apparently, Mr. Clement continues to be employed by the Corps despite its July acknowledgement that the case was mishandled.

This is exactly the kind of big government arrogance that insinuates itself into 
Americans' lives every day.  As Thomas Jefferson professed: "I own that I am not a friend of
a very energetic government.  It is always oppressive."   ... How prophetic!

<P>
<b>Send us your examples</b> of the tyranny of government, the insults and instances of a government thats too big, too rich and too much in our faces.  Send us news clips our fax number is 202-371-0210 or <a href="mailto:abic@abic.org">e-mail</a> us the anecdotes.  Tell us about ways the government (local, state or federal) is out of control.

<h2>About Americans Back In Charge Foundation</h2>
</center>

In 1990, the voters of Colorado began a nationwide revolution with their vote in favor of
term limits for Members of Congress.  Their vote was soon joined by 25 million more votes for
term limits in 23 states around the country over the last four years.<p>

Americans Back In Charge grew out of the original Colorado citizens' group, Coloradans
Back In Charge.  Founded in 1991, ABIC has been active in the state efforts by providing
grassroots support to other state citizens' groups.  Once those state term limits laws were passed,
ABIC Foundation was an integral part of the effort to defend those initiatives in courts of law
around the country, including the U.S. Supreme Court.  ABIC's legal project, the Term Limits
Legal Institute, served as co-counsel for the State of Arkansas when the Arkansas Attorney
General defended his state's term limits law before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994.  Further,
TLLI served as counsel for the Washington state term limits group, LIMIT, when former House
Speaker Tom Foley sued his constituents in an effort to overturn the term limits law they passed
in 1992.<p>

ABIC Foundation continues its work of compiling information and analyzing the data on
the issues of term limits, the balanced budget amendment, and other key issues.  This web site is
an effort to provide some of that information and analysis to Americans who feel that these issues
are important to the future of our republic so that they may be empowered to put Americans Back
in Charge!

<h3>Union Members Resent AFL-CIO Aid to Dems  - Frank Luntz
The Hill, May 8, 1996

</H3></CENTER>
<BR><P>

<P>
Virtually everyone inside the Capital Beltway is familiar with the much ballyhooed political campaign being waged against the Republican Congress by organized labor. In fact, Washington-based labor bosses have bragged openly of their plan to spend $35 million in a campaign to defeat targeted Republicans. They have already increased mandatory dues to foot the bill, aired some of the most negative ads in years, and organized at the grass-roots level. In fact, the only thing they have not done is to inform their rank-and-file membership and ask their approval.
<P>
So we did. On behalf of Americans for a Balanced Budget, Luntz research surveyed 1,000 union members nationwide from April 23 through the 28th. The margin for error is +/-3.1%.
<P>
What we found may not please the Washington union leadership. What is surprising is not  the rank-and-file's objection to their dues being used for political activity - they do - but the depth and breadth of that opposition.
<P>
Union members overwhelmingly prefer the leadership of their local chapters to the leadership of their national chapters. When deciding union policy and priorities, members feel better represented by local chapters by a sizable 66 percent to 21 percent margin. When asked who does a better job in terms of "candidates, politics and political issue," local leadership again beast national leadership - 44 percent to 32 percent
<P>
Furthermore, 25 percent told us they "rarely" or "never" follow the advice of their local leadership, and that reaction jumps to 33 percent for national leadership. If forced to choose, only 13 percent would support a nationally endorsed candidate, while 41 percent would be more likely to support the local candidate. That does not bode well for the unions' current political effort. In fact, opposition to the effort will undoubtedly increase the split between local and national loyalty - with local unions the benefactors.
<P>
Union members have activities other than politics in mind when asked to prioritize union efforts. Preserving jobs was by far the top choice (58 percent), followed by increasing wages (27 percent). Improving the image of unions was a distant third (8 percent), but still chosen more often than engaging in political election activities (at just 4 percent). Even when given a second choice, only 9 percent chose election activities - the lowest response of the four.
<P>
This brings us to the partisan political campaign being waged by the Washington leadership. More than half of the rank-and-file had no idea such a campaign even existed. After they were told the AFL-CIO was planning to spend $35 million in mandatory monthly dues to defeat congressional Republicans, their reaction was overwhelmingly hostile.
<P>
Overall, 15 percent of the rank-and-file "strongly support" the campaign, 16 percent "somewhat support" it, while 21 percent "somewhat oppose." The bulk of members (41 percent) are "strongly opposed."
<P>
These results don't change by gender, age, education level or income. Even a plurality of Democrats (48 percent) oppose the campaign against the Republican Congress.
<P>
The biggest surprise? Those who voted against a GOP candidate for Congress in 1994 (and should endorse this effort) are evenly split :46 percent support the union effort, 46 percent oppose it.
<P>
Perhaps more importantly, among newest union members, the political campaign is opposed by a 77 percent to 19 percent margin. For a national leadership that claims to be committed to rebuilding their image, this is a very dangerous result.
<P>
We asked members if they knew they were eligible for a refund of their due spent for political purposes. Less than one-fifth responded affirmatively.
<P>
And when union members were told they had a right to a refund of dues spent for political purposes, one 20 percent would "definitely" request their money back, and another 20 percent would be "very likely" to request a refund.
<P>
Regarding the upcoming presidential campaign, Bill Clinton holds a healthy 50 percent to 20 percent lead over Bob Dole among union members, with Ross Perot at 11 percent and the remaining 19 percent undecided. The president leads among every union demographic group.
<P>
But while rank-and-file union membership is predisposed to support Clinton and other Democratic candidates in 1996, Republicans should not give up hope.
<P>
The beliefs and priorities of union members ought not to be confused with the beliefs and priorities of union leadership. After all, on issues like welfare reform, a balanced budget amendment and tax reductions - all opposed by national labor leaders - union members agree with us (87 percent, 82 percent and 78 percent respectively).
<P>
A local campaign waged from union hall to union hall - emphasizing balanced budgets, welfare reform and family tax cuts - could deliver up to 40 percent of the union vote, enough to ensure a GOP sweep in November. From ideology to issues, the rank-and-file is still up for grabs. The fact is, the average congressional Republican has more in common with them than their own Washington leadership.<P>

<P>
More than 60%of union members oppose the AFL-CIO's negative advertising blitz against Republican House members, according to anationwide poll released today by Americans for a Balanced Budget. National AFL-CIO officials have earmarked $35 million in members' compulory dues money to defeat Congressional Republicans who support a balanced budget, tax cuts and welfare reform.
<P>
The poll, conducted by Frank Luntz and Associates between April 23-28, shows that national union officials are oput of touch with their members on union politics and priorities.
<P>
<ul>
<li> 62 percent of union members oppose the use of their dues for negative political advertising against Republicna House members.

<li> 82 percent want a constitutional amendment that requires Congress to balance the budget each year.

<li> 87 percent favor work requirements for welfare recipients and limits on the limits on the length of time they can collect welfare checks.

<li> 78 percent support tax reductions that include a $500 per child tax credit.

<li> When informed of national union officials' campaign against Republicans who support these porposals, 59 percent say they would ask for a refund of their dues.
</ul>
<P>
"Clearly Washington union officials are hopelessly out of touch with rank and file union members," said ABB president Tony Zagotta at a news conference at the National Press Club. "They are shamelessly plundering workers; compulsory dues to promote tax-and-spend policies that union members oppose.
<P>
"Union members, like their fellow Americans, overwhelmingly support a balanced budget. Fiscally responsible House members should take heart from these figures, and continue to press forward with genuine budget reform proposals. The American people are on our side."

Republican leaders are preparing an all-out attack designed to counter a $35 million campaign mounted by labor unions to help elect Democratic candidates this fall. Among the legislative plans being considered: a proposal that would require more-detailed disclosure of political lobbying and contributions by union members and a bill that would make it easier for workers to resign from a union. In addition, GOP leaders are expected to tout a new poll of 1000 union members that purportedly shows a split between the AFL-CIO's official political policies and the view of its rank-and-file over such issues as welfare reform, the minimum wage and a $500-per-child tax credit. The sponsor of the survey, a conservative organization called Americans for a Balanced Budget, also claims that about 70 percent of union members would likely ask for part of their dues back if they were aware of the difference between their view and those of the union leaders.
<P>

The Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, April 30, 1996   Page 1
<P>
Union Politics spark mixed reaction, survey shows.
<P>
With the AFL-CIO vowing to spend at least $35 million to defeat House Republicans this fall, rank and file union members have been mostly mute. But silence doesn't mean support, says Americans for a Balanced Budget, a right-leaning lobby. In fact, the group says its own poll, to be released today, shows widespread dissent.
<P>
Republican pollster Frank Luntz questioned 1000 union members last week and found that 41% "strongly oppose" the AFL-CIO's spending plan while only 14% "strongly support" it. The remaining 45% have no strong opinion. Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees union and head of the AFL-CIO's political efforts, said the AFL-CIO's own surveys show overwhelming support.
<P>

The Washington Times, Wednesday, May 1, 1996 Page A18
<P>
What union members think
<P>
Perhaps more galling than the fact that the AFL-CIO has launcheda massive - and dubiously legal - political campaign to unseat freshmen House Republicans is the fact that they are wagin this campaign with the wages of their members, and without the workers' consent.
<P>
A poll conducted by Frank Luntz for Americans for a Balanced Budget, released yesterday, reveals just how far the union bosses have strayed from the priorities of the union rank and file. When union members were asked whether they supported or opposed the AFL-CIO's decision to spend $35 million in dues in an effort to defeat Republicans, 62 percent said they opposed the unions' political use of dues. Only 31 percent supported the big l;abor campaign.<P>
Union bosses like to pretend that they are "representing" workers in the political arena. But it's news to the workers. Less than half of the union members polled knew that the national labor unions were garnishing their wages to pay for a national political campaign. And only 19 percent knew that they were entitled to demand a refund on the portion of their dues apenst on politicking. Told about that right, a majority of the worker said they wanted those dollars back. As od now, the unions do not have an accounting to members for how their union dues are spent. Asked if they would support a new law to require full disclosure of where their due dollars are going, an overwhelming 84 percent of union members said yes.
<P>
The disconnect between big labor bosses and the workers becomes even more pronounced whenthe union members are asked - free of partisan labels - what they think of key proposals being advanced by the Republican Congress. Not suprisingly, workers were not too patient with those who don't work: Eightly-seven percent support welfare that requires work and I slimited of duration. They also support a balanced budget ammendment by a huge margin, with 82 percent in favor of a constitutional requirement that Washington keep its fiscal house in order. And more than three-fourths of the union workers voiced their support for tax cuts for working families.
<P>
Twice as many of the workers describe themselves as Democrats than Republicans. But the real leanings of the workers come through when asked if they are conservative, moderate or liberal: 44 percent call themselves conservative, 32 percent are moderates, and only 18 percent say liberal. Given that union bosses are lobbying for liberal policies, is it any surprise that well over half of the workers polled say that the attack on the Republican Congress is no way to spend their union dues?
<P>
What could better illustrate the Democrats' true concern for the "workers" whose interest they are always invoking? Presidentr Clinton and his compatriots are more than happy to benefit from money that has been taken from workers against their wishes. Reductions in employees take-home pay are all right, it seems, as long as the differenc ends up in Democratic campaign coffers.

<h3>BLASTS AFL-CLO CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION EFFORT<BR>
$35 MILLION TARGETED FOR 75 DISTRICTS<BR>
</H3></CENTER>
<BR><P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Ben Magliano<br>
202-638-6124<br>
<p>
             February 1, 1996</B> -- The AFL-CIO is planning to punish Republican congressmen who voted in favor of a 
balanced federal budget by pouring over $35 million dollars into 75 congressional races this 
year. Their goal is to win back Democratic control of the House of Representatives.<p>

This years $35 million dollar expenditure is seven times the normal amount spent by the 
ALF-CIO during an election year and represents an average of $466,000 per race. This figure is 
substantially higher than the $322,929 expended on all 1994 congressional races, according to 
current FEC data.<p>

&quot;I am amazed at the lengths the AFL-CIO will go in order to kill the balanced budget 
initiative, &quot; says Tony Zagotta, President of Americans For a Balanced Budget. &quot;Next to Bill 
Clinton, organized labor is a balanced budget's worst enemy.&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget recently launched a nationwide radio campaign to 
correct the lies being told by the AFL-CIO over Medicare. These ads have run in Illinois, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, and 
Wyoming over the past month.<p>

&quot;The AFL-CIO launched a dishonest campaign last year against 27 Congressmen for their 
courageous votes to balance the budget,&quot; says Zagotta, &quot;It now appears that the union leadership 
is poised to take their deceitful message to an even greater audience.&quot;<p>

In addition to the millions of dollars the AFL-CIO will pour into these congressional 
races, the labor giant will also make in-kind contributions of AFL-CIO personnel and facilities. 
These in-kind donations could easily double the $35 million dollar independent media campaign.<p>

&quot;The Oregon Senate race is a good example of the in-kind support that the AFL-CIO will 
be extending to upcoming congressional races, &quot; says Zagotta. &quot;More than 25 union activists 
were sent to Oregon to work full-time for Ron Wyden - that's a force nearly as big as Gordon 
Smith's entire campaign staff! In addition, the AFL-CIO paid for over 200,000 pieces of direct 
mail and set up phone banks throughout the state.&quot;<p>

AFL-CIO Leaders met with President Clinton for nearly two hours on January 8th 
and urged him to hold fast against Republican budget demands. In particular, the union 
representatives wanted to kill Medicare reform and reject any budget proposed 
tax cuts.<p>

&quot;Actions speak louder than words, so it is readily apparent that Bill Clinton lied to the 
American people during his State of the Union Address, &quot; says Zagotta. &quot;The era of Big 
Government is alive and well and has a good friend in the White House.&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal 
budget. Founded in 1990, the non-partisan grassroots organization has over 200,000 members in 
all fifty states.<p>

<p>
          February 2, 1996</B> -- Americans For a Balanced Budget has launched the fifth wave of its nationwide campaign to correct the 
distortions and lies being told about Medicare spending. The first radio spots began airing in 
Wyoming today.<p>

Washington Congresswoman has been targeted by the AFL-CIO 
and other liberal special interest groups due to her votes in favor of the balanced budget. 
Numerous television and radio advertisements funded by these groups have made the erroneous 
claim that Congresswoman Cubin voted to cut Medicare.<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget has decided to answer this charge with the truth. The budget 
passed by congress and vetoed by President Clinton increases Medicare spending by 48%.<p>

&quot;Check with any major news organizations - The New York Times, The Washington Post, ABC 
News - Their reports all prove that the congressional plan increases Medicare spending, &quot; says 
Tony Zagotta, President of Americans For a Balanced Budget, &quot;These lies and distortions are 
designed to divert our attention away from President Clinton and his unwillingness to propose 
his own seven year balanced budget .&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal 
budget. Founded in 1990, the non-partisan grassroots organization has over 200,000 members in

<center>
<img src="/abb/images/hdr-abou.gif">
</center>
<P>
Americans for a Balanced Budget(ABB) was founded in 1990 by David Miner, a 	member of the North Carolina General Assembly.  With over 200,000 members in all fifty 	states, ABB is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal budget.
<P>
ABB is a non-partisan, grassroots lobbying organization and registered as a 
501(c)(4) with the Internal Revenue Service.
<P>
The mission of ABB is to promote a balanced federal budget, a Balanced Budget
Amendment -- with tax limitation -- to the United States Constitution, and pro-growth
economic policies.
<P>
ABBs efforts in these areas have earned the respect of senior political leaders
like Senator Bob Dole, who recently said, "Long before it became popular, ABB was 	working hard for a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility in Washington.  And since
its founding, ABB has played a major role in exposing the dangers of the welfare state
and of big government."
<P>
The current president of ABB is Tony Zagotta.  He is the former National 		Chairman of the College Republicans, and he most recently managed a congressional
campaign in North Carolina. 
<P>
<h2>The People at ABB</h2>
<h3>Tony Zagotta</h3>
Tony Zagotta, president of Americans for a Balanced Budget, joined ABB in February of 1995. 
He has overseen the growth of the organization to over 200,000 members nationwide. He is also 
directly responsible for the success of ABB's latest radio ad campaign.<p>

In addition to his time at ABB, he is the Chairman of the International Youth Democrat Union, 
the conservative international youth organization. He was elected in 1994 to a two-year term.  
The parent organization, the International Democrat Union, was founded by Ronald Reagan and 
Margaret Thatcher in 1983. The current co-Chairman is Jack Kemp.<p>

Previously, Zagotta was the National Chairman for the College Republicans. Originally elected 
in 1989 for a two-year term, he was re-elected in 1991. With a staff of ten, he planned the largest 
College Republican event in history when over 1200 students showed up for the Centiennial 
Celebration in July of 1992. During that time he was served as the Honorary Chairman of Youth 
for Bush/Quayle `92.<p>

Zagotta has been involved in politics since his graduation from Illinois State University. He has 
had experience in all different fields, ranging from being a Political Instructor for the 
International Republican Institute, to an International Observer at the Guatemala Presidential 
Elections in 1990. He was also a field representative for Jack Kemp for President in 1988 and 
was employed as a legislative assistant in the Illinois General Assembly in 1988.<p>

Zagotta relocated to Washington, DC, from his hometown in Chicago six years ago.<p>
<h3>Emily McGee</h3>
Emily McGee has been  at Americans for a Balanced Budget since February 1995. In addition to 
her tasks as Program Director, she has recently been promoted to Director of Online Services.<p>

Before McGee joined ABB, she worked at Smith & Harroff, Inc. in Alexandria, Virginia as an 
intern during the 1994 elections. While there she focused on several different aspects of 
campaign work, most notably media buying. She also assisted on research for the corporate 
clients.<p>

While a student at Colgate University, located in Hamilton, New York, she was active in College 
Republicans at the school, state, and national levels. Not only was she the club chairman and 
state executive director, she also spent several summers in Washington, DC volunteering at the 
College Republican National Committee. During that time she helped with the College 
Republican Biennial Convention as well as the Republican National Convention.<p>

Originally from Massachusetts, McGee moved to Washington shortly after she graduated from 
college in 1994. <p>

<title>Current Program Interests</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/bradley/bg.gif">
<blockquote><blockquote>

<center>
<img src="/bradley/hdr-cpi.gif">
</center>
<P>
The Foundation's Board, on occasion, undertakes to define and redefine its current program interests. At present, the Foundation aims to encourage projects that focus on cultivating a renewed, healthier, and more vigorous sense of citizenship among the American people, and among peoples of other nations, as well.<p>

The free society so central to the convictions and success of the Bradley brothers rests upon and is intended to nurture a solid foundation of competent, self-goveming citizens, who are understood to be fully capable of and personally responsible for making the major political, economic, and moral decisions that shape their own lives, and the lives of their children. Such decisions are made on the basis of common sense, received wisdom, traditional values, and everyday moral understandings, which are in tum nurtured and passed on to future generations by healthy families, churches, neighborhoods, voluntary associabons, schools, and other valuegenerabng "mediating structures."<p>

This expansive understanding of citizenship is being 
challenged today, however, by contemporary forces and ideas that regard individuals more as passive and helpless vicbms of powerful extemal forces than as personally responsible, self-goveming citizens, and that foster a deep skepticism about citizenly values and mediating structures. Consequently, authority and accountability tend to flow away from citizens toward centralized, bureaucratic, "service-providing" institutions which claim to be peculiarly equipped to cope with those extemal forces on behalf of their "clients." This systematic disenfranchisement of the citizen, and the consequent erosion of citizenly mediating structures, pose grave threats to the free society that the Bradley brothers cherished.<p>

In light of these considerations, projects likely to be supported by the Foundation will generally share these assumptions:<p>
<ul>

<li>They will treat free men and women as genuinely self-goveming, personally responsible citizens, not as victims or clients.

<li>They will aim to restore the intellectual and cultural legitimacy of citizenly common sense, the received wisdom of experience, everyday morality, and personal character, refurbishing their roles as reliable guideposts of everyday life.

<li>They will seek to reinvigorate and reempower the traditional, local institutions -- families, schools, churches, and neighborhoods -- that provide training in and room for the exercise of genuine citizenship, that pass on everyday morality to the next generation, and that cultivate personal character.

<li>They will encourage decentralization of power and accountability away from centralized, bureaucratic, national institutions back to the states, localities, and revitalized mediating structures where citizenship is more fully realized.

</ul>
<p>

In addition to these thematic considerations, eligible projects will exhibit these  features:<p>

<ul>
<li>They may address any arena of public life -- economics, politics, culture, or civil society -- where citizenship as here understood is an important issue. It is important to note that our view of citizenship is not primarily concerned with promoting civics education, voter awareness or tum-out, or similar activities narrowly focused on voting and elections.

<li>They may address the problem of citizenship at home or abroad, where the fall of many (and the perpetuation of some) totalitarian regimes has made this issue particularly urgent.  In light of our emphasis on decentralization, and considering the Foundation's deep roots in Milwaukee and Wisconsin -- areas with proud traditions of innovation and experimentation in democratic citzenship -- community and state projects will be of particular interest to us. Such projects will aim to improve the life of the community through increasing cultural and educabonal opportunities, grass-roots economic development, and effective and humane social and health services, reflecting where possible the Foundation's focus on the resuscitation of citizenship.  

<li>Projects may be actual demonstrations of the resuscitation of citizenship in the economic, political, cultural, or social realms; policy research and writing about approaches encouraging that resuscitation; academic research and writing that explore the intellectual roots of citizenship, its decline, and prospects for revival; and popular writing and media projects that illustrate for a broader public audience the themes of citizenship.
</ul>
<p>

Much of the creative and energetic leadership essential for a renewal of citizenship will be supplied by gifted individuals, who must receive challenging and stimulating programs and instruction at all levels of their education. The Foundation supports programs that research the needs of gifted children and techniques of providing education for students with superior skills and/or intelligence. Research programs investigating how learning occurs in gifted children and demonstration programs of instruction are to be considered.

<P>

The programs and funding decisions of The Bradley Foundation are the responsibility of the Board of Directors. At the discretion of the Board, the policies set forth herein will be modified in response to changing conditions and priorities.<p>

The guidelines established by the Board of Directors will normally preclude funding for unspecified and undetailed overhead costs. No funds will be authorized for fees payable to fund- raising counsel. In addition, grants without significant import to the Foundation's areas of interest will only under special conditions be considered for endowment or deficit financing purposes.<p>

The Foundation will:<p>
<ul>
<li>Normally award grants only to organizations and institutions exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Intemal Revenue Code and publicly supported under section 509(a)(1), (2) or (3);

<li>Favor projects which are not normally financed by public tax funds;

<li>Consider requests from religious organizations and institutions only when the resulting impact of the project is not primarily denominational;

<li>Consider requests for building projects on rare occasions and, in such cases where projects are reviewed, limit grants to only a small fraction of the total project cost.
</ul>
<p>

Grantees must possess the resources to properly administer grants from the Foundabon. The Foundabon conducts an annual evaluation of grants, and grantees are asked to provide periodic reports on the progress of their work.

<P>
In 1903, Lynde and Harry Bradley established a new business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It took courage and confidence for them to risk resources in a new venture, based only on their judgement of what was and their vision of what could be. The Bradleys' confidence was bolstered by the knowledge that in America, not only were they free to start a business, they could also begin again if they failed. The Bradleys, however, would not fail. Their business grew to become the Allen-Bradley Company.<p>

When the Allen-Bradley Company was acquired by Rockwell Intemational Corporation in 1985, a significant portion of the proceeds was dedicated to establishing The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. Although it has no direct ties to the Allen-Bradley Company, the purpose of the Foundation is to commemorate Lynde and Harry Bradley by preserving and extending the principles and philosophy by which they lived and upon which they built the company.<p>

As their efforts succeeded, their business grew and eventually extended far beyond its Milwaukee headquarters. Lynde and Harry Bradley remained devoted to the city where they began their enterprise and in which they lived and worked for so many years. Their foundation will continue the Bradleys' interest in helping to improve the quality of life in the Milwaukee metropolitan area.<p>

The Bradleys lived and worked according to several philosophical principles. They :believed that, over time, the consequences of ideas were more decisive than the force of political or economic movements. They recognized the interdependence of human endeavors --  cultural, educational, philosophical, economic -- and they rejected exclusionary emphasis on any single element. The brothers had an abiding belief in the dignity and decency of each person. They felt that only in an environment of political and economic freedom could individuals develop their talents, hone their skills and intellects, and contribute to the improvement of the human condition. The success of the Allen-Bradley Company stands in eloquent testimony to the enduring quality of these principles.<p>

The Bradley brothers were committed to preserving and defending the tradition of free representative govemment and private enterprise which has enabled the American nation and, in a larger sense, the entire Westem world to flourish intellectually and economically. The Bradleys believed that the good society is a free society. The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation is likewise devoted to strengthening American democratic capitalism and the institutions, principles and values which sustain and nurture it. Its programs support limited, competent govemment; a dynamic marketplace for economic, intellectual, and cultural activity; and a vigorous defense at home and abroad of American ideas and institutions. In addition, recognizing that responsible self- government depends on enlightened citizens and informed public opinion, the Foundation supports scholarly studies and academic achievement.

<h3>Milwaukee's Bradley Legacy<br>
Continues as Foundation<br>
Moves to Historic "Lion House"<br>
</h3>
<img src="/bradley/lionhouse.gif">
</center>
<P>
In Milwaukee's sesquicentennial year, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation has taken stewardship for one of the community's architectural treasures, relocating it headquarters to the landmark "Lion House" in the First Ward Triangle Historic District. Noted as the city's "finest surviving pre-Civil War home" and named for the carved lions crouched upon its portico, the Lion House represents the aspirations of Milwaukee's immigrant settlers and the community's heritage of civic participation.<P>

Built in 1855 as the vision of German immigrant Edward Diederichs, the Lion House has been the home of many prominent citizens, including entrepreneur Henry Mann in the 1860's banker and civic leader John Johnston in the 1890's, and, in the 1940's, president of Marine National Exchange Bank, Eliot Fitch, who was also an active leader in many local civic institutions. Architecturally restored and converted to commercial office space by James A. and James D. Hummert in the 1980's, the building was chosen last year by the Foundation's Board of Directors as a headquarters that will mark the continuing and active presence of the legacy of Lynde and Harry Bradley in the Milwaukee community.<P>

Combining the institution's office needs with a project of historical restoration is particularly apt at the time of Milwaukee's 150th anniversary, said Foundation President Michael S. Joyce, noting that "our Board is very intentionally sending the message that the Bradley Foundation is at once rooted in Milwaukee's heritage and looking to its future." The move, Joyce added, "ensures the preservation and stewardship of one of our city's most charming landmarks and provides efficient office space in a convenient location for the Foundation's philanthropic operations."<p>

The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, established in 1985, is a private, independent grantmaking organization directed to supporting research and education. Due to its modest size and near-downtown location, the Lion House will be a suitable headquarters for the Milwaukee-based institution's small staff. Extensive renovations consistent with the building's architectural integrity were planned by Uihlein Architects and executed by D.G. Beyer, Inc. to coordinate operational and historic objective.

<P><B>APPLICATION PROCEDURE</B>
<P>
<P>Two steps are required in the application process.  
First, the applicant should prepare a brief letter of 
inquiry, describing the applicant's organization and intended project. 
 If the Foundation determines the project to be within 
its current program interests the applicant will be invited 
to submit a formal proposal.
<P>
<P>The second step is the actual submission of the proposal. 
 Applicants should submit a letter presenting a 
concise description of the project, its objectives and 
significance, and the qualifications of the organizations and 
individuals involved.  Included with the letter should be a project 
budget, the amount of the grant sought from The 
Bradley Foundation, and other sources of support.  The 
applicant should complete the &quot;Grantee Tax Exempt 
Status Information&quot; form included with the Program 
Guidelines and submit a copy of the IRS letter confirming 
the organization's tax exempt and public support status 
under Sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a), respectively, of the 
Internal Revenue Code.
<P>
<P>Meetings between the Foundation staff and 
applicants, where necessary, will be arranged after the receipt of 
a written proposal.  Final authority for making grants 
rests with the Board of Directors, which meets four times a 
year, February, May/June, September, and November.  
The Directors act on grant requests after proposals have 
been comprehensively reviewed by Foundation staff.  
Each proposal is reviewed according to its unique characteristics. 
 To be considered at one of these meetings, proposals 
should be submitted by the following dates:  December 1, 
March 1, July 1, September 1.
<P>
<P>Whenever possible, proposals submitted by these 
deadlines will be considered at the next Board meeting.  
However, circumstances may sometimes require a lengthier period 
of review.
<P>
<P>Because of the necessarily limited resources of 
the Foundation, many worthwhile projects cannot be supported.  The demands on the Foundation's 
resources also limit the size of particular grants and the ability of 
the Foundation to make commitments for extended periods.
<P>
<P><B>DEVELOPING A DETAILED PROPOSAL</B>
<P>
<P>This is a checklist which we hope will be useful to you 
in developing a detailed proposal.  It is intended as a 
guide only on points to make in a request.  We do not expect 
or want a lengthy proposal but need only sufficient detail 
to go forward with our review.
<P>
<P><I>Program Description</I>
<P><ul>
<P><li>     Statement of the basic objective of the 
proposal (one paragraph).
<P><li>     Definition of the problem to which the proposal 
is addressed.
<P><li>     Statement of potential impact of the proposal 
on the problem.
<P><li>     Whom will it benefit and how?
<P><li>     Description of work plan and time frame 
for accomplishing the objectives of the proposal.
<P><li>     Length of time Bradley Foundation aid will 
be needed and most desirable times to start and terminate the grant.
<P><li>     How will the project be supported beyond 
the period of funding requested from the Foundation?
<P><li>     Is this a new or an ongoing activity on the part 
of sponsoring institution?
<P><li>     Has the field been researched to find similar efforts?
<P><li>     Has a similar project succeeded or failed?  Why?
<P><li>     Description of evaluation plan:
<P>     <ul><li>  ongoing evaluation of program during period of
<P>         the grant
<P>     <li>  criteria by which the effectiveness of the grant
<P>         should be judged at the end of the grant period.
<P></ul></ul>
<P><I>Project Personnel</I>
<P><ul>
<P><li>     Brief description of the qualifications of 
individuals who will be conducting the project and administering the grant if awarded.  Include 
resumes for key personnel.

<CENTER><I>David Wilkinson was the first Inspector General of 
the Legal Services Corporation (1989-91) and the Utah 
Attorney General from 1981 to 1989.</I></CENTER>

<P>The Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a federally 
funded agency designed to support legal services 
organizations that serve the poor, has been the focus of 
controversy almost without interruption since its creation in 1974. 
 Conservative critics charge that LSC funds are 
improperly used to challenge electoral redistricting plans, 
represent illegal aliens and drug dealers, and bring class 
action lawsuits against laws made by elected officials.  
Liberal supporters counter that LSC-funded organizations 
spend most of their resources representing the poor and 
disadvantaged in routine legal cases such as landlord-tenant 
disputes.
<P>Until recently, however, few have questioned 
whether federal dollars are needed at all to provide legal 
assistance to the poor.  Whatever may have once been the case, 
are adequate private and non-federal resources available 
today to meet the legal needs of the poor?
<P><I><B>Unknown to many, legal services providers 
receiving LSC funds also take in at least $324 million from 
private and other public sourcesan amount in excess of 
the LSC's current federal appropriation of $283 million. 
 Moreover, there are an additional 1,350 providers 
of legal services to the needy who receive no 
government funding and whose budgets total over $200 million. 
 Finally, some 400,000 to 600,000 lawyers perform 
an estimated 24,000,000 hours of pro bono work 
annually valued at $3.3 billion.</B></I>
<P>
<a name="1">
<B>The House of Representative's Aborted Plan</B>

<P>In 1995, the House of Representatives developed a 
three-step budget resolution to phase out the LSC's funding 
by October 1997.  Both the House and Senate took the 
first step last year by reducing LSC funding from $400 
million to $283 million.  The second step called for a 
further reduction of funding to $141 million for fiscal year 
1997, followed by an end to all federal support.
<P>The House Appropriations Committee voted earlier 
this year to take the second step.  But when the 
appropriations bill reached the House floor on July 23rd, 56 
Republicans voted with all but three Democrats to fund the LSC at 
$250 million.  Lobbyists for increased funding, led by the 
Americ Bar Association, had predicted a close vote and 
were elated by the comfortable margin of victory.  Their 
success was complete when the final fiscal budget figure came in 
at $283 million -- the same amount the LSC received in 
fiscal year 1996.  The House three-step plan, in other 
words, appears to have been aborted after achieving only 
one-third of its planned savings in federal expenditures.
<P>House reformers planned to phase out LSC funding 
in order to give LSC-supported legal services 
organizations sufficient time to acquire replacement funds.  Many of 
these organizations originally received all their funding from 
the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a War on 
Poverty agency created in the mid-1960s.  However, other 
LSC-funded legal services providers that predate the OEO 
have had substantial non-federal funding for years.
<P>Today, almost all LSC-funded organizations 
receive funding from non-federal sources.  In fact, in the 
just-ended 1996 fiscal yearthe first year of the reduction in 
the LSC's budgetnon-LSC funding of these 428 
providers surpassed LSC funding.  That the LSC is now providing 
less than half the total funding of all its granteesand only 
a third of the funding of all providerswas never 
discussed in the lengthy debate preceding the recent House vote.  
Nor was there any mention that some 1,350 legal service 
providers receive no money from the LSC yet have 
budgets totalling over two hundred million dollars.  Although 
the House debate did address the question of whether pro 
bono lawyers who volunteer their services for the needy 
could &quot;fill the gap&quot; created by further cuts in the LSC's budget, 
no mention was made of how much non-LSC money the 
nation's legal services providers have at their disposal.
<P>

<a name="2">
<B>States Move to Fill the Gap</B>
<P>Less than a month before the House vote, the state of 
New Jersey, using court filing fee revenue, increased funding 
to its network of 15 legal services providers by an 
estimated $8.2 million.  The state legislature acted on the belief 
that LSC funding, already reduced, would probably be 
cut again, and might ultimately disappear.  New Jersey's 
legal services providers now have a total budget of $25.5 
million28 percent more than last yeardespite a $2.2 
million reduction in LSC monies.
<P>New Jersey is not the only state that has recently 
increased its budget for legal services.  Pennsylvania, only 
six days before the House vote, cleared the way for an 
estimated $6-million annual infusion of new money for its 
19 LSC-funded and 22 non-LSC-funded providers.  
The legislature's decision was based on the same 
argument made in the New Jersey legislaturethat LSC 
funding would likely be cut this year and eliminated next year.  
In fact, as <a href="#Table I">Table I</a> shows, at least six states have found 
their legal service resources greater this year due to new 
money from private and other public sources.
<P>The chief source of this money is state funding in 
the form of first-time or increased filing fee revenue and 
general operations revenue.  States that began funding 
civil legal services for the first time in 1995 include 
Kentucky, Missouri, and Rhode Island.  Still other states, 
including California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Tennessee, raised their level 
of support.  All told, an unprecedented surge of over 
$35 million in new state money was added to legal 
services budgets in the last year and a half in 17 states, 
including those in <a href="#Table I">Table I</a>.
<P>

<a name="3">
<B>A Conspiracy of Silence</B>
<P>Many LSC recipients and supporters know that the 
amount of non-LSC funding available to legal services providers 
is far more than anyone has ever communicated to 
Congress, but they have kept this fact well guarded.  For instance, 
all but one of New Jersey's thirteen members in the House 
of Representatives, including eight Republicans, recently 
voted to increase LSC funding.  None of them informed 
their colleagues during the July 23rd floor debate that 
New Jersey recently provided $8.2 million in new state 
money for legal services.  Likewise, Republican 
Representative Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, co-sponsor of the measure 
to increase LSC funding, was silent about 
Pennsylvania's allocation of an additional $6 million for legal services.
<P>This pattern of seeking federal funds for legal 
services with prior knowledge that one's own state is already 
providing state funds seems to be common.  Retiring 
LSC president Alexander Forger acknowledged the practice 
in an unguarded statement before the LSC Board in 1994. 
 While Forger was president of the New York State 
Bar, New York adopted IOLA. (Most other states use the term &quot;IOLTA,&quot; 
or Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts.)  
Under this program, most states require lawyers to turn 
over interest generated by their clients' trust funds to a fund 
used mostly to finance legal services programs.  Forger 
advised his colleagues, &quot;I would put in a footnote, for 
budgetary purposes in congressional presentations, that New 
York State... last year, in recognition of the decrease in 
IOLA funds at the state level and at the city level, 
appropriated unrestricted funds for legal services to poor people. . . .  
I trust Congress won't inquire as to whether local 
jurisdictions are undertaking some of that responsibility.&quot;  
The state funding referred to was $3 million, and it 
continued for at least three years.<B><I>1</I></B>
<P>Forger, no doubt, would excuse his failure to 
volunteer this information by arguing that this amount, even 
when supplemented by LSC funding, was inadequate to serve 
the legal needs of the poor.  But the flaw in this reasoning 
was identified by the executive director of Chicago 
Volunteer Legal Services, a non-LSC-funded legal services 
provider that relies on hundreds of pro bono lawyers.  In a 
public debate last year over whether filing fees should be 
increased to generate more revenue for legal services in 
Cook County (Chicago), M. Lee Witte remarked, &quot;what 
legal service providers want . . . is 
infinite.&quot;<B><I>2</I></B>
<P>

<a name="4">
<B>The LSC's Questionable Data</B>
<P>There is a wide disparity between the actual amount 
of funding for legal services for the needy and the figure 
the LSC has presented to Congress for the last ten years.  
This discrepancy exists because the LSC only disseminates 
information about providers who receive direct grants 
from the LSC.
<P>There are good reasons to question the LSC's figures. 
 First, the LSC compiles the amounts of non-LSC 
funding from paperwork submitted by providers when they 
apply for LSC grants.  These amounts are not audited.  
Furthermore, the amounts sometimes differ significantly 
from figures in other published sources.
<P>For instance, in 1995 the Legal Aid Society (LAS) of 
San Diego, an LSC-funded provider, reported to IOLTA 
administrators of the California State Bar that its non-LSC 
funding in 1994 was approximately $1.6 million.  LSC 
records, however, showed its 1994 non-LSC funding to be less 
than $1.1 million.  This half million dollar difference could 
be due to the LSC's failure to include the provider's 
so-called &quot;derivative income,&quot; such as attorney fee awards, 
publication and investment income, and unexpended or 
carry-over funds.  Until the early 1990s, such derivative income 
was always included in LSC figures presented to Congress. 
 This generally amounted to 15.2 percent of providers' 
non-LSC funding and 4.9 percent of their LSC grants.  For 
some individual providers, the amount was much higher.  But 
the $500,000 difference could also be due to the 
provider giving one figure to the LSC and another to the 
California State Bar.
<P>In any case, the LSC should inform Congress how 
much derivative income all LSC-funded providers have reported. 
 Providers are still required to submit this information to 
the LSC.
<P>

<a name="5">
<B>Subgrantees' Non-LSC Funding</B>
<P>The LSC has also failed to provide Congress with 
adequate information on the many LSC subgrantees.  
These are providers who receive money indirectly from the 
LSC in the form of subgrants made by LSC-funded providers.
<P>No one knows the exact number of subgrantees.  In 
1995, the LSC compiled a list of subgrantees that was intended 
to be official.  It listed 98 subgrantees, some of whom 
received more than one LSC subgrant.  Since the list was 
released, however, research has identified another 12 to 14 
providers that claim to have received LSC funding in 1995, in 
some cases as subgrantees.  For instance, the LSC's list 
includes only ten California subgrantees.  However, 
Congressman Julian Dixon of California referred to 14 
California subgrantees as of 1995 during the recent House 
debate.<B><I>3</I></B>
<P>While the LSC has provided Congress with 
information on the non-LSC funding of its direct grantees, it has 
not offered amounts of non-LSC funding for its 
subgrantees, which in 1995 numbered at least 112.  <a href="#Table II">Table II</a> shows 
the total budgets of eight subgrantees in 1995.  (These eight 
had the largest budgets of 18 subgrantees for which total 
budget funding information was available.)  Total 1995 non-LSC 
funding for these eight subgrantees was nearly $29 million.  
Another $8 million in non-LSC funding derives from 
the combined budgets of the remaining 10 subgrantees 
and from a portion of the combined budgets of another 
27 subgrantees.  Together, these 45 subgrantees obtained 
$37 million in non-LSC funding.  This amount was not 
included in the LSC's non-LSC funding figure of $249 million 
for 1995.<B><I>4</I></B>
<P>Yet this $37 million figure is far from complete 
because it does not account for the non-LSC funding of at least 
67 remaining subgrantees for which adequate information 
is unavailable.<B><I>5</I></B>  Available data suggests that the 112 or 
more subgrantees of LSC monies spent over $75 million in 
non-LSC funds on legal services to the poor in 1995.  Added 
to the LSC's figure for 1995 of $249 million, total 
non-LSC funding for the 428 or more providers receiving 
LSC grants, directly or indirectly, probably exceeded $324 
million.
<P>

<a name="5">
<B>Total Non-LSC Funding</B>
<P>This amount does not include the more than 1,350 
legal services providers, such as Chicago Volunteer Legal 
Services, that have operated year after year without any LSC funding.  
One must take into account over 950 largely 
pro bono &quot;private bar involvement&quot; (PBI) programs which 
the ABA lists in its annual PBI directory and over 1,110 
legal services providers that received IOLTA grants during 
the last year.  After adding the 428 direct and indirect 
recipients of LSC money in 1995 and eliminating duplicates 
from these three lists, over 1,625 providers remain.  To this 
can be added a number of providers who do not appear on 
any of these lists, such as the approximately 45 chapters 
and affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union.  All 
told, there are easily 1,800 providers of civil legal services in 
all 50 states.
<P>Although the combined funding of these providers 
has never been the subject of a comprehensive study, 
enough data exists to make a fairly reliable estimate of total 
non-LSC funding.  <a href="#Table III">Table III</a> shows the non-LSC funding of 
of all states that compiled and reported on their non-LSC funding
over a 12-month period during the last three years.  
These 13 states had combined non-LSC funding of $175 million.
<P>Extrapolating to the 50 states, total nationwide 
non-LSC funding for legal services is $463 
million.<B><I>6</I></B>  To this can be added the resources of the ACLU's network of chapters 
and affiliates -- $35 million.  This total of $498 million is 
more than double the $210 million in non-LSC funding that 
the LSC estimates its direct grantees received in 1996.
<P>Yet even this figure of $498 million is incomplete.  
It does not count, for instance, the hundreds of millions 
in public funds that each year support consumer 
protection and constituent service functions at the federal, state, 
and local levels of government.  Much of this addresses the 
civil legal problems of the poor in the same way as do pro 
bono and salaried legal services lawyers.  Nor does this 
amount include the hundreds of millions that government and 
private sources distribute each year to social services 
agencies that deal with non-legal problems often brought to 
legal services lawyers.  Considerable data show that most of 
the &quot;cases&quot; handled by LSC-funded lawyers are actually 
problems that can be addressed by non-lawyers.  To cite 
only one instance, the Legal Referral Service of the San 
Francisco Bar Association refers 75 percent of its 85,000 
yearly calls to government agencies or social 
services.<B><I>7</I></B>

<B>The Future of Legal Services for the Poor</B>
<P>The impact of reduced LSC funding in 1996 
together with the potential loss of IOLTA funds resulting from 
a recent federal appeals court decision will be the 
overriding concern voiced by LSC supporters in the near future. 
 Whether further cuts are made in the LSC's budget 
will largely depend on whether Congress is convinced 
that private and other public resources can &quot;fill the gap.&quot;
<P>If LSC funding is reduced by another substantial 
amount, at least some LSC grantees may have to cease 
operations given the competitive and rapidly growing legal 
services industry.  Clearly, however, there are considerable 
private and other public resources for meeting the legal needs of 
the poor.  Alan Houseman, a key draftsman of the 1974 
LSC Act, has observed that &quot;There's an unfortunate notion 
in Legal Services that only experts like themselves can 
litigate these kinds of [class action] cases.  But there's a 
broad range of public interest programs around the country 
that don't take Federal money that can do them.  And we 
haven't really even begun to tap the private 
bar.&quot;<B><I>8</I></B>  Houseman would no doubt stress that his comments apply only 
to class actions, but they apply equally if not more so to the 
routine types of cases that Congress has said should be the 
only focus of LSC-funded providers.  Another longtime 
legal services lawyer, Mike Daniel, has remarked, &quot;I don't 
know how you can justify taking federal money to provide 
routine legal services.  There are other lawyers who will do 
those routine [cases].&quot;<B><I>9</I></B>  Indeed, not only are there other 
lawyers; there are considerable non-lawyer resources that can 
assist the needy just as effectivelyand for less 
money.<B><I>10</I></B>
<P>If the LSC were abolished, there would still be at 
least half a billion dollars available each year for legal 
services for the needy.  This does not count the far greater value 
of pro bono work on behalf of the poor.  Nor does it count 
the support of government and private consumer and 
social-service agencies whose work directly affects the poor.
<P>Is $283 million in federal legal services funding 
still necessary?  If Congress is serious about balancing 
the budget and reducing the role of the federal government, 
it might wish to revisit the LSC budget next spring.

<B>Pro Bono Legal Services for the Poor</B>
<BR>
Lawyers have a long and distinguished history of providing free or 
<I>pro bono</I> (from the Latin &quot;Pro bono publico,&quot; meaning &quot;for public good&quot;) legal services 
to the poora history that predates the nation's founding. 
 Accounts of the young lawyer Abe Lincoln 
representing poor clients for little or no compensation have 
always been part of the lore of the young Republic.  The 
history of formal pro bono legal service organizations is 
almost as long and equally distinguished.
<P>Organized delivery of free legal services began 
in 1876 with the founding in New York City of what 
became the Legal Aid Society (LAS).  Created to help 
poor German immigrants, by 1901 it was serving 16,000 
clients of all nationalities.  (Today, the LAS civil office 
has a $20-million budget, all of which comes from 
sources other than the LSC.)  Another venerable provider of legal services, the Chicago Bureau of 
Justice, was created in 1888 and was the first organization 
to provide civil legal help to the poor regardless of 
nationality or race.  By 1923, at least 33 legal aid societies 
in over 40 cities were providing basic legal services.
<P>According to the LSC, the number of private 
attorneys in the United States today who perform pro bono 
civil legal work for the poor is roughly 130,000.  This, 
however, was the figure cited by an ABA spokesman 
seven years ago when there were less than 500 organized 
pro bono programs.  Whatever the figure's accuracy then, 
it is totally unreliable today since the number of pro 
bono programs has increased to 950.  Moreover, ABA 
official Laurie Zelon recently conceded that the 130,000 
figure does not count the many lawyers who perform 
valuable pro bono service outside of organized 
legal-services programs.
<P>By conservative estimates, at least 400,000 and 
possibly as many as 600,000or between 44 and 67 
percent of all private attorneysdo pro bono work.  
These numbers are derived from surveys conducted in 
states with lawyer populations totalling half the lawyers in 
the U.S.
<P>Assuming that the remaining number of lawyers 
per forms an equal amount of pro bono work, the total number of lawyers rendering pro bono service in 
1991 was approximately 473,000.  Since the total lawyer 
population grew from 805,872 in 1991 to 896,172 in 1995, 
the number of lawyers currently providing at least some 
pro bono work is probably close to 525,000.  Thus, the 
range of 400,000 to 600,000 is realistic.  Whatever the 
exact number, it is far greater than the 130,000 
commonly cited.
<P>Information on the amount and value of pro bono 
work lawyers perform is available for six 
statesCalifornia, Florida, Maryland, New York, Oregon, and Texas.  
Together, these states contain 40 percent of all lawyers. 
 Assuming that these states and the value placed on their 
lawyers' time by their state bar leaders are representative 
of the total lawyer population, an estimated $3.3-billion worth of pro bono work is 
performed annually in the U.S.  That is over 8 times the LSC's 
1995 budget.
<P>Critics may dismiss this figure by arguing that 
most LSC-funded lawyers are full-time and compensated on 
a salary basis; their much lower hourly rate cannot 
be compared to this estimated value of pro bono hours.  
A more accurate analysis, they say, would compare 
the number of hours LSC-funded lawyers work to the 
number of pro bono hours.
<P>If we extrapolate the number of pro bono hours 
contributed in the six states surveyed (9,659,709) to 
all lawyers, this suggests that lawyers contribute 
over 24,000,000 pro bono hours per year.  In other words, 
pro bono attorneys contribute over five times the number 
of hours worked annually by the 4,749 staff attorneys of 
the approximately 281 providers in the LSC's network.

<h2>Pennsylvania Legislative Report: Restricting Foundation Influence Over State Government</h2>
<p>
<i>Editor's Note:  Last month we reported in "Briefly Noted" that the Pennsylvania General Assembly was considering a measure to curtail nonprofit foundation grantmaking to state agencies.  In this issue, Genevieve Young, a lawyer specializing in health law issues, provides a thorough review and analysis of the proposal, explores the events that led to its consideration, and explains why this has become an important issue for all state governments.</i>
<p>Imagine this scenario:  An organization obtains the names of every Medicaid-eligible student under the age of 21 in a state's public school system, and provides those names to the local school district.  It explains that it has figured out how to get Medicaid to make payments to the district every time a school encourages one of its eligible kids to go to the school guidance counselor.  Now imagine that every time one of those students visits a guidance counselor, the Medicaid program is billed for "mental health services."  Does this sound far-fetched?  It does.  Is it happening?  It is.  Does it sound like Medicaid fraud?  Yes.  So why haven't we heard of any investigations by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG)?  
<p>The reason the public is unlikely to hear Washington officials express outrage about this development is that the fraud has not been perpetrated by a fly-by-night health care company or a cabal of doctors.  It's being carried out by state officials in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and other states that have established public school health clinics.
<p>But this idea did not originate with the "educrats"; they're only implementing the programs, defending the benefits they derive from the program, and hiding the costs.  The real impetus for the creative exploitation of school health clinics and related programs comes from certain prominent private foundations.  They have discovered a new way to affect public policy -- just pay for what you want to have happen.  Foundations have found that it's possible to get the government to initiate unpopular programs by simply giving grants of money to state agencies to set up pilot projects.  
<p>The money comes with conditions, but cash-hungry agencies don't mind.  Agency heads are happy to do the foundations' bidding because they are always in search of new missions that they can use to justify their budgets.  The idea is to use foundation "seed money" to launch new government social programs or expand existing ones.  Soon various clients and interest groups will see the benefits for them; agency officials will argue that that there is an evident need for the programs; and the taxpayers -- not the foundations -- will be stuck with the bill.
<p>The problem with this cozy partnership of public agency and private foundation is that it's undemocratic.  If they wanted to provide services to people who want them, the foundations could spend their ample funds creating charitable institutions to accomplish a mission they think needs doing.  They could even practice the kind of public interest advocacy that unfortunately has become the commonplace way to generate support for programs that nonprofits think the government should provide.  But the foundations prefer to skip the process of public persuasion.  They would rather simply pay state agencies to buy their programs off the shelf.  
<p>This novel approach to public policy has gone unnoticed until recently.  But state legislators, protective of their own prerogatives, are taking notice.
<p>

<p>
<p><b>Pennsylvania Targets the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</b>
<p>
<p>On November 19, 1996, the Subcommittee on House Resolution 37, a body reporting to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives' Committee on Education, adopted certain Findings of Fact and issued a Report.  It concerned abuses of a state program intended to allow public schools to tap into Medicaid funds.  House Resolution 37 directed Pennsylvania legislators to scrutinize the program, which it said lacked adequate statutory authority and which state agencies had initiated without affording to the legislature the opportunity to consider its consequences.  
<p>The Report's recommendations were based on thousands of documents, seven hearings, and testimony from nearly 75 persons.  While investigating how the legislature's authority had been circumvented, the Subcommittee discovered that state agencies had entered into relationships with certain private foundations in exchange for grant money to support the establishment of school-based health clinics.
<p>The Subcommittee Report expressed the concern that these relationships were usually carried out without notice to the general public.  It also became clear during the inquiry that certain employees of state agencies were having their salaries paid, in whole or in part, by private foundation money.  Moreover, foundation documents indicated that although money was distributed as a "grant," it had strings attached.  In the case of grants made by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), Pennsylvania had executed contracts with the foundation giving RWJF exclusive and perpetual rights to data collected in connection with the state program, even if the data would otherwise be considered confidential and private under federal and state law.
<P>The Report is a historic step -- and it is likely the first of its kind -- that a state's legislators have taken to curtail encroachments on their constitutional authority by unelected officials serving in the state's executive and administrative agencies.  The language of the Report is unambiguous:
<p>
<blockquote>The Select Subcommittee's inquiry has... found that the Executive Branch's school based mental health and rehabilitative programs have been created and implemented in ways that cavalierly disregard the proper role of the General Assembly as the elected representatives of the people in formulating public policy.  In this regard, the Executive Branch has implemented this massive program... through a patchwork of bureaucratic initiatives rather than the legislative process where these difficult social and fiscal issues are more properly decided.  For instance, comprehensive mental health services are being provided throughout the public school system despite the absence of clear and specific statutory authority....  While there may be funding authorization for these initiatives within the state budget, this is a woefully inadequate substitute for the solid statutory framework that forms the only legitimate foundation for exercise of power in a representative democracy.</blockquote>
<p>The Report specifically focuses on the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF).  It finds that besides bypassing the General Assembly, the Executive Branch "tailored its discretionary authority to meet the specifications of a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a private entity, in order to obtain funding from this private source."
<p>The Report further establishes that the Executive Branch relied upon a RWJF "pilot project" to develop techniques for implementing Pennsylvania's statewide program to provide comprehensive mental health and related services to students, a program that is heavily dependent on Medicaid and other state monies.  In fact, a Department of Public Welfare memorandum that the Select Subcommittee obtained identified RWJF as a primary source for all of Pennsylvania's school-based mental and other health initiatives.
<p>The authors of the Report say that its findings will be the basis for legislation on the use of medical and educational records by the public school system to protect the privacy rights of parents and children, and that the legislation should require parents' prior written and informed consent for their children to participate in activities and services provided in the schools.  The proposed legislation will also protect the fiscal integrity of Pennsylvania's Medicaid program, particularly as it is used by the public schools.  Finally, there are several specific recommendations about how private foundations may interact with state agencies.  Says Rep. Samuel E. Rohrer, Chairman of the Subcommittee on House Resolution 37, "It's going to have a tremendous ripple effect on all the policy coming out of this administration."
<p>The Report calls for laws that would require authorization before the state can receive grant funds.  It calls for prior notice to the public and the General Assembly before state officials can apply for private grant monies.  Without express statutory authorization, it says agencies cannot participate in pilot projects or other foundation initiatives that come with strings attached.
<p>The Report also recommends that any foundation-funded project narrative, its costs, and proposed terms and conditions should be reported in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, the official administrative register, along with 30 days' notice, and that the Majority and Minority Chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and other committees should be notified before a state agency makes a commitment to participate in a project.  It would prohibit agencies from accepting private funds to pay the compensation of any state employee without providing similar detailed notice.
<p>Finally, the Report urges the Pennsylvania General Assembly to consider legislation to restrict the types of agreements that state agencies can enter into in exchange for grant money.  Adequate privacy safeguards should be instituted before agencies extend contractual rights to private organizations for any data collected in connection with their participation in or funding of state programs. 
<p>
<p>
<b>What's Going On in the Public Schools?</b>
<p>House Resolution 37 directed the Select Subcommittee to examine four major issues relating to Pennsylvania's public school system:
<p>1.	the use of the public schools to deliver mental health services;
<p>2.	whether existing safeguards and procedures for protecting student and family privacy were adequate, as well as whether there were proper procedures for obtaining the written, informed consent of parents on a full range of school activities, including participation in special education programs;
<p>3.	in the Report's words:  "fiscal, regulatory, privacy, informed consent, and other issues relating to a program enabling school districts to tap into Medicaid funding for certain health services (known as "ACCESS");"
<p>4.	the impact of recent changes in federal law, regulation, and policy as they related to education curriculum, learning outcomes, and other educational standards and goals for students.
<p>The Report's findings on those four issues included discussion of the results of the Subcommittee's investigation of the activities of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, other private foundations, and certain officials in the years 1988 through 1994 during the administration of Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey.  On the issue of school-based clinics and school mental health programs, the Subcommittee found that "Private foundations have been utilizing their private funds in order to shape state programs for the delivery of mental health services in public schools without any oversight or regulation by the General Assembly."  It also stated that this policy had been driven by an agenda "which appear[s] to be indifferent to the privacy interests of students and families."
<p>The Subcommittee obtained documents from state agencies which showed how RWJF projects and activities in those agencies strongly influenced their programs.  For example, the state's director of the Office of Mental Health ("OMH") wrote that the RWJF's Mental Health Services for Youth project "was the prototype for our expanded mental health services under OBRA 89/EPSDT...a major OMH initiative."  "OBRA 89" stands for the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989 and "EPSDT" means the federal Medicaid benefits known as "Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment."  This program is discussed in greater detail in the March 1996 issue of Organization Trends.  The state Mental Health Office began its ambitious project to deliver EPSDT services to children in Pennsylvania public schools and to bill Medicaid.  The elaborate scheme promised to transform schools into Medicaid providers so that school districts could become claim recipients for Medicaid funds.
<p>The Report notes that Medicaid law does not require states to use their public school systems to implement the EPSDT program.  Indeed, critics warn that there are important public policy reasons why the education system should not be commingled with a health care delivery system that emphasizes mental health diagnosis and treatment.  Will children be referred to mental health treatment for pedagogical reasons rather than medically indicated ones?  According to the report "The mental health alternative will be very tempting to some educators and school administrators who are frustrated by their inability to improve their students' academic and/or behavioral performance."  Already huge numbers of children all across the country are given Ritalin, a drug presribed for a condition labelled Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Is this a real health concern, or is it just easier for teachers to control kids by putting them on drugs?  
<p>
<b>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Shows State Health Agencies How To Shape Education Policy</b>
<p>The RWJF is funding other states besides Pennsylvania to implement its program to establish school-based health services that can be billed to Medicaid.  In 1995, nine states received RWJF grants from its "Making the Grade Program: State and Local Partnerships to Establish School-Based Health Centers."

<b>Kentucky Follows Where Annie E. Casey Foundation Leads</b>
<p>
<p>The Johnson Foundation is not the only player in this Medicaid shuffle.  The Annie E. Casey Foundation has been a driving force behind a similar multi-million dollar initiative in Kentucky.  In December 1996, a small group of Kentucky state legislators who make up the state's Administrative Regulation Review Committee approved regulations funding a new $80 million dollar Medicaid program in the public schools.  Federal Medicaid monies would provide about $56 million and some $23 million would be from state education dollars.  Kentucky's Department of Medicaid Services provided the names of all Medicaid-eligible individuals under the age of 21 to the Kentucky Department of Education ("KDE").  This is the same procedure that was also followed by the Department of Public Welfare and the state's Department of Education.  The KDE then created a new Medicaid provider category -- local school districts.  Armed with their very own Medicaid billing numbers -- heretofore reserved only for health care institutions and practitioners licensed under state law -- school districts are now free to supplement what they consider their meager education budgets with "free" federal money from the Medicaid program.
<p>The KDE and the local school districts claim that children needing "special services" can now get them -- because Medicaid will pay for them.  These are services the schools are required to provide after all.  The regulations, however, allow the Medicaid program to be billed for all sorts of "physical and mental health services" provided not by licensed health care professionals, but by school personnel -- such as guidance counselors -- whose licensure or certification is assured by the "Kentucky Education Professionals Standards Board."
<p>Kentucky parents testified that they were concerned not only for the fiscal ramifications of this new program, but also, most importantly, for the welfare of the school children involved.  While state officials tout the program's potential for providing services to the state's most vulnerable children, the poor and disabled, they ignore the possibility that these children will be harmed, physically and emotionally, and that parents' rights to oversee and provide proper care for their children's needs will be infringed.  No Kentucky statutes provide standards for the administration of this program.  All of these concerns, however, apparently pale in comparison to the prospect that Kentucky's education bureaucracy will receive $80 million dollars in federal and state money.
<p>Pennsylvania's Committee on Education has aired its finding of facts before members of the state General Assembly.  It is hoped that hearings will be held soon in Kentucky, and that other states may follow suit.
<p>Two things are clear.  First, the giants of American philanthropy have directed their efforts again to the promotion of programs that intrude into areas that should remain the province of the family, not the state.  Second, they have done so in a manner that undermines the democratic process by excluding meaningful public discourse and flouting the authority of elected representatives.  
<p>Back room policymaking -- for that is what the "public-private partnership" is -- is being subjected to the glare of public scrutiny.  The Pennsylvania legislature has undertaken an important public service by exposing how private monies are used to initiate and implement state regulatory programs that ultimately are funded by the taxpayers.  How will Pennsylvania taxpayers respond?

<TR><TD>The Select Subcommittee's findings and recommendations are summarized in a report available from Rep. Samuel E. Rohrer, Chairman of the Select Subcommittee on House Resolution 37.  Room 423 South Office Building, Harrisburgh, PA  17120-2020
<p><b><center>EXCERPTS OF COMMITTEE REPORT:</center></b>
<p><blockquote>"When Executive Branch officials accept conditions in return for private funds, and without legislative oversight, this raises the disturbing question of whether the program was adopted because it best reflected legislative intent . . . or whether those objectives were compromised by the desirability of obtaining money from a private organization with its own notion of the common good.  It may be unclear, perhaps even in the bureaucracy's own collective mind, as to whether components of its program were adopted on the basis of money or merit."</blockquote>
<p><blockquote>"It is one thing to seek change, it is quite another when changes in public policy are influenced by the offering of private money to state governmental institutions, especially when those changes vitally affect individuals' privacy ... and dramatically affect the public treasury, all without ever approaching the General Assembly....  Rather, the changes sought are purchased from executive agencies, absent necessary statutory limits and protection, and then the agencies -- and these `purchasers of public policy' -- turn to the legislative branch with bloated budgets -- the consequences of their acts -- seeking continued funding of programs already administratively implemented under the inducement of private grant moneys."</blockquote>
<p><blockquote>"The availability of the mental health option for educators, together with the fact that federal and state taxpayers, rather than the school district, will pick up the cost, is likely to lead to a gross misutilization of Medicaid resources for reimbursing services that would not have been indicated as medically necessary if the child had accessed the Medicaid system through sources other than the public school system."</blockquote>

How the Great Foundations Established PBS</FONT><P>by Laurence Jarvik<BR><P><FONT SIZE=2>What we know as our present Public Broadcasting Service
began with a $5 million federal appropriation in 1967. Over thirty years PBS has grown 
into a multi-billion dollar worldwide multi-media empire.  While its public sources of funding and its 
commercial enterprises are common knowledge, its foundation ties are little understood.  PBS is largely the 
creation of the great private foundations.  The most important of these are the Ford Foundation -- which has 
poured over $300 million into the television market to support non-commercial broadcasting -- and the 
Carnegie Corporation of New York, whose 1967 Carnegie Commission report led to the establishment of 
the federally-funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting in the Johnson Administration. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Today, public radio and television comprise the largest networks on the air.  When judged by 
number of affiliates, PBS is bigger than Fox, CBS, NBC, or ABC.  Public broadcasters also publish 
magazines and newsletters, and they provide computer programs, on-line services, sites on the World Wide 
Web, and classroom study guides and textbooks.  They host conferences; license toys, games, and clothing; 
stage live shows; run mail order catalogs and retail stores; and distribute videocassettes and compact disks.  
These activities have created a large industry that parallels commercial broadcasting.  Yet the natural 
checks and balances of the marketplace do not govern their operations, nor are they regulated by the 
political checks and balances of a federal agency.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The bureaucratic structure of PBS is deliberately complicated and very difficult to describe.  
Former PBS president Larry Grossman has said it is "a system no one in the outside world understands or 
can penetrate. It is a system that ensures that public television will remain mired in second-class status with 
a top-heavy, expensive and stifling bureaucracy..."  But in other ways it is like the other broadcast 
networks.  MacNeil-Lehrer Productions president Al Vecchione testified to Congress in 1988 that "all of 
the same functions, duties and responsibilities that exist for commercial broadcasting also exist for public 
broadcasting.  Commercial networks have a corporate division which does the allocating of money and 
establishes the priorities through policies; we have CPB.  They have a network division which obtains, 
schedules, and distributes the national programming; we have PBS."</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In 1993 New York's Twentieth Century Fund, a liberal foundation based on the Boston 
department store fortune of Edward I. Filene, assembled a blue-ribbon task force to examine the finances 
and practices of PBS.  (PBS stations declined to open their books and therefore research was dependent on 
what station managers estimated rather than actual figures).  The panel was chaired by Brown University 
president Vartan Gregorian and included executives Eli Evans from the Revlon Foundation and Lloyd 
Morrissett from the Markle Foundation as well as former PBS president Larry Grossman and current PBS 
president Ervin Duggan.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The task force's conclusions were presented in a final document, <I>Quality Time?</I>, which 
described a system that wastes three-quarters of its money, produces mediocre programming, and depends 
on British imports to please its audience.  The Twentieth Century Fund task force recommended that all 
federal aid to local PBS stations be ended, a conclusion that it based on the principle that "individual 
station operations should be supported by the communities they serve."  While the diagnosis of PBS's 
problems was telling, the task force prescriptions were not implemented.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT><P><I><B><FONT SIZE=2>BUNDY, FRIENDLY, GARDNER: PRESENT AT THE CREATION<BR></FONT></B></I><P><FONT SIZE=2>The origins of public broadcasting lay in a 1960's era decision by the Ford Foundation to shift its spending 
on television programming from support for <I>Omnibus</I>, a cultural affairs program hosted by Alistair 
Cooke in the 1950's on all three networks, and to invest instead in the creation of a national educational 
network.  That decision had the unintended consequence of drawing educational and cultural programs out 
of the commercial networks and putting it into the television equivalent of a fancy suburban subdivision 
insulated from civic life.  "Quality" programs like <I>National Geographic</I> specials, Texaco 
broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera, and Leonard Bernstein's symphony concerts switched to PBS 
from the networks where they originated, and became the corollary to the hollowing out of American cities 
that resulted as the upper-middle classes retreated to secure enclaves of safe streets and good schools.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In the 1950's, the commercial networks did a good job in exposing large audiences to cultural 
programming.  NBC mingled adaptations of Shakespeare (e.g. Sir Maurice Evans's 1954 <I>Hallmark Hall 
of Fame</I> production of "Macbeth") with its popular fare.  CBS's Ed Sullivan Show exposed audiences 
to the Bolshoi Ballet as well as Elvis Presley, and Agnes De Mille's ballets along with The Beatles. The 
networks in the 1950's and 1960's did much to provide "highbrow" entertainment for the mass audience, a 
fact that academic critics of television have tended to overlook.  Indeed, much PBS programming was 
poached from the commercial sector.  The <I>MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour</I> was produced by a team 
from NBC News and resembled the <I>Huntley-Brinkley Report</I>.  Bill Moyers shuttled between CBS 
News and PBS.  William F. Buckley's <I>Firing Line</I> first appeared on RKO General stations before 
moving to PBS.  <I>Frontline</I>'s first anchorwoman was NBC News' Jessica Savitch.  Veteran Moyers' 
producers from CBS News launched <I>The American Experience</I> while <I>National 
Geographic</I> specials simply moved from CBS.  <I>Nova</I>'s science producers came from the 
BBC.  The makers of CBS's <I>Captain Kangaroo</I> produced <I>Sesame Street</I>.  Even the 
Muppets had done early commercials for La Choy Chow Mein.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Yet, in his best-selling 1967 memoir, <I>Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control</I>, Ford 
Foundation television consultant Fred Friendly called for the establishment of National Educational 
Television _ what would become PBS _ by postulating a conflict between "common stock"  and "the 
common weal."  Friendly claimed that ratings, commercials, and the profit motive were obstacles to first-
rate television coverage and argued that television would never live up to its potential until it abandoned its 
connection to the commercial marketplace.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Friendly recognized what writer Jane Jacobs in <I>Systems of Survival</I> (1992) has described 
as a conflict between the "commercial moral syndrome" based on trade and the "guardian moral syndrome" 
based on power and position.  But unlike Jacobs, who argues that each has its appropriate function, 
Friendly clearly disdained trade.  He argued that "television will gain the most if it is given a less profit-
minded base; instead, its health would be guaranteed by the nation's intellectual well being, which it must 
help develop in order for both the country and the medium to survive."  Simply put, Friendy wanted to 
replace popular and entertaining shows with programs acceptable to his personal taste and notions of 
quality.  He even boasted to readers that Ford Foundation president McGeorge Bundy recently had hired 
him to develop projects in "public service" broadcasting in opposition to the principles of commercial 
television.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Bundy and Friendly were an odd couple.  Friendly had built his personal fortune as Edward R. 
Murrow's radio and television producer:  their <I>Hear It Now</I> records were bestsellers.  He was an 
autodidact, a middle-class striver from Providence, Rhode Island who never graduated from college yet 
became a Columbia University professor.  By contrast, Bundy was a genuine Boston Brahmin who had 
won all the glittering prizes in education and public service.  The grandson of Harvard president A. 
Lawrence Lowell, Bundy moved from elementary school classmate of John F. Kennedy to dean of the 
Harvard faculty.  As a young man he had helped Secretary of War Henry Stimson write his memoirs, and 
in 1961 he left Harvard to serve as national security advisor to presidents Kennedy and Johnson, helping to 
develop the policies that led to the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the war in Vietnam.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Bundy's reward for public service was the Ford Foundation.  As president from 1966 to 1979 
Bundy authorized the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars for television _ for projects selected 
and overseen by Friendly.  The largest grant recipient was WNET channel 13, a flagship operation in New 
York City, America's largest television market and the nation's media center.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Sizeable grants also went to WGBH, Boston, whose president, Hartford Gunn, was McGeorge 
Bundy's Harvard roommate.  Not surprisingly, WGBH became the largest supplier of programs to PBS 
after Gunn became PBS's first president in 1969.  In public television lore the Boston station's call letters 
stand for "God Bless Harvard."</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Like many of the "best and brightest," Bundy could not have helped but be affected by one of the 
most influential books of the period, John W. Gardner's <I>Excellence: Can We Be Equal and Excellent 
Too?</I>, which appeared in 1961.  Gardner was a foundation man, too, heading up the Carnegie 
Corporation.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Gardner's arguments provide an intellectual roadmap for one of the great exertions of the early 
1960s:  The attempt by those in and around the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to foster a national 
program of cultural uplift and, with it, a new social and cultural elite.  Public broadcasting was but one 
element alongside New York City's Lincoln Center, Washington D.C.'s Kennedy Center, and the National 
Endowments for the Arts and Humanities in the mission to create American equivalents to Europe's 
national monuments of culture and learning and a social class to appreciate them.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In his book, Gardner argued that America's leadership class at the close of the 1950's was 
inadequate for a great world power.  A Ph.D. in psychology with expertise in intelligence testing, Gardner 
was appalled by what he perceived as the middle-brow mediocrity of Eisenhower's America.  Like Bundy, 
he worked for the OSS during World War II and was obsessed by the idea of "excellence" and the 
possibility of engineering it.  Gardner wanted to make a clean break with middle-class values in order to 
properly organize America's "natural aristocracy."</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Because leadership responsibility in America was too widely dispersed among different interest 
groups at different social levels, Gardner argued that leaders were failing to recognize the "obligations 
which they have incurred as a result of the eminence they have achieved."  Lacking badges of rank, they 
could not recognize one another let alone claim "their responsibility to the larger community. Opposed to 
notions of middle-class individualism, Gardner sought ways to encourage opinion leaders "to help a society 
achieve the best that is in it."  One way was clearly to establish a broadcasting system dedicated to "public 
service" and aimed at a target audience of the social strata that ought to hold sway in society.  Watching 
such a network would be a marker of respectability.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Like Bundy, Gardner was a philanthropist, educator, and government official.  As president of 
Carnegie, he personally approved the initial $500,000 grant which made possible the 1967 Carnegie 
Commission report on public television.  As President Johnson's Secretary of Health, Education, and 
Welfare, Gardner testified before Congress in 1967 to urge federal funding of the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting.  And shortly after that he approved the first HEW grants to produce <I>Sesame Street</I>.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2><i><b>THE ORIGINS OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING</i></b><BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>On September 16, 1962, the his-tory of American television changed when the legendary broadcast 
journalist Edward R. Murrow hosted the dedication of WNET channel 13 to the cause of public 
broadcasting.  It became the first non-profit educational television station to broadcast in New York City.  
This event marked the transition of what was then called "educational television" from an instructional 
medium for extension courses carried in secondary broadcast markets into what would become at decade's 
end the PBS network.  FCC chairman Newton Minow appeared with Murrow on the maiden broadcast.  
Minow's position was made clear the year before when, in a speech to the National Association of 
Broadcasters (NAB), he had scolded his audience for creating a "vast wasteland" - two words that 
influenced public perceptions of commercial television for a generation.  In due course Minow became 
chairman of PBS and later of the Carnegie Corporation of New York.  But on that day Murrow and Minow 
were celebrating the start of a public broadcasting system whose origins began in an earlier era of radio.  
Foundation financing, however, was always a key ingredient in the attempt to shape its development.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The first educational stations were established by colleges and schools on radio in the 1920's.  
They tended to depend on the goodwill of state legislatures, boards of regents, and local philanthropists.  In 
1929, however, two major New York philanthropic institutions, the Carnegie Corporation and the Payne 
Study and Experiment Fund, evinced interest in the new trend by financing an Advisory Committee on 
Education by Radio.  The committee issued its report in 1930 with recommendations that the federal 
government reserve broadcast bandwidth for educational purposes and that it work to obtain funding for 
education programs.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In July 1930, the Rockefeller Foundation commissioned its own report.  Unlike the Carnegie-
Payne study, Rockefeller recommended that educational programming be integrated into commercial 
broadcasts.  The straightforward reason: money.  Educators, it concluded, could not be expected to raise 
the budgets necessary to finance their own stations.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>A third group, the National Committee on Education by Radio (NCER), opposed a commercial 
takeover and supported the college and university stations.  Established in 1931 and financed by the Payne 
Fund, its members included the National Education Association and the National Association of State 
University Presidents.  The Committee urged the federal government to reserve 15 percent of available 
radio bandwidth for noncommercial educational use.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The Federal Radio Commission, the FCC's predecessor, eventually agreed to set aside five radio 
channels for non-commercial use in 1938,  and it added fifteen more by 1945.  After World War II radio 
expanded into the FM portion of the dial, and the FCC reserved still more room for educational radio, a 
precedent that subsequently would be applied to television channels in the 1950's.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>At the end of World War II, fledgling commercial television broadcasters did not see educational 
broadcasters as potential rivals.  In October 1950, the University of Iowa began broadcasting on 
commercial channel WOI-TV, making it the first educational television station in the United States.  (It 
received funding from the Ford Foundation's Fund for Adult Education.)  Commercial broadcasters even 
offered educational institutions free television air time because in those early days they could not generate 
enough advertising to support a full schedule of paid programming.  For instance, DuMont (the forgotten 
fourth and least profitable television network, many of whose stations eventually became Fox affiliates 
when Rupert Murdoch set up shop in the 1980's), made a deal with the New York Board of Education to 
carry instructional programs at no charge.  Philadelphia's WFIL-TV collaborated with the University of 
Pennsylvania and the Annenberg Foundation, headed by publishing magnate Walter Annenberg (later 
funder of the Annenberg/CPB Project) to produce Penn faculty lectures grandly labelled "University of the 
Air."  So poor was the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) that it resorted to 
"bicycling" - routing from television station to station - sound tapes (and later films) for broadcast among 
its 52 member stations.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In 1948 the FCC froze new licenses for commercial television channels, an act that would have 
far-reaching consequences.  Officially, the action was caused by a dispute between CBS and NBC over 
incompatible color broadcasting systems that delayed the introduction of color television by a decade.  But 
one effect was that it helped to preserve the commercial networks' broadcasting oligopoly and, with it, the 
industry's dominance by Democrats.  The networks' FCC television licenses had been issued during the 
Roosevelt and Truman administrations, and many Democratic leaders considered that their partisan 
advantage in the new medium of television merely balanced the predominantly Republican owners of the 
major daily newspapers.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>A second consequence of the freeze was that it gave an opening to advocates of noncommercial 
broadcasting.  NAEB took quick advantage.  It retained the law firm of Leonard Marks and Marcus Cohn, 
both former FCC officials, and filed to reserve for educational use ten Ultra High Frequency (UHF) 
television channels.  UHF was a new television technology, analogous to FM in radio.  To discredit 
commercial VHF channels NAEB conducted a study of violence on television (a tactic repeated today in 
the debate over the so-called "v-chip").  Supported by a grant from the Ford Foundation, it documented 
2,970 "acts of violence" on commercial television in the single week, seventeen in children's viewing hours 
before 9 p.m.  This would be the first of many such studies that supporters of public broadcasting would 
use for political ends.  The National Education Association (NEA) and the American Council on Education 
(ACE), both Washington, DC-based education lobbies, supplied funds to prepare testimony before the FCC 
supporting channel reservation for educational purposes.  The NEA and ACE also supported the Joint 
Committee on Educational Television (JCET), a new group whose purpose was also to lobby for channel 
reservation.  It had a $90,000 grant from the Ford Foundation's Fund for Adult Education to pay for legal 
expenses incurred in preparing testimony on this issue before the FCC. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>JCET hired Telford Taylor to prepare its case.  He was the former prosecutor at the Nuremberg 
War Crimes Trial, a former FCC general counsel, and one of the most prominent attorneys in the United 
States at the time.  Exuding high-mindedness yet not lacking in political connections, Taylor prepared his 
testimony using the NAEB violence study as evidence of the need for commercial-free television channels.  
With financial help from the Ford Foundation's Fund for Adult Education, the JCET compiled over seventy 
statements supporting its case.  They came from the AFL-CIO, the PTA, and many prominent educators.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>By the time the FCC "freeze" on commercial licensing ended in 1952 American educational 
institutions had succeeded in obtaining exclusive rights to 242 radio and television frequencies for the 
purposes of non-commercial instructional broadcasting.  They were divided between 80 VHF stations and 
162 UHF stations.  Although educational television proponents did not have the equipment, staff, or 
programming to fully use all 242 channels, they promised a golden future.  In 1953, KUHT at the 
University of Houston, Texas, became America's first non-commercial educational licensee.  By 1960 there 
would be 49 educational television stations operating on the 257 channels reserved by the FCC.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2><I><B>HIS MASTERS' VOICE</I></B> <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In 1952 the Ford Foundation set up the National Citizen's Committee for Educational Television with a 
$90,000 grant to lobby for educational broadcasting.  That same year the Ford Foundation's Scott Fletcher 
became director of the Educational Television and Radio Center, which was established in Ann Arbor, 
Michigan to provide programs to educational broadcasters.  Ford gave the Center an initial grant of 
$1,350,000; a year later the grant was more than doubled.  By 1960, Ford's annual support was around $14 
million.  By 1970, Ford would pour over $300 million into a variety of educational stations and 
programming, creating in the process the National Educational Television network (NET).  "Without 
repeated Ford Foundation transfusions," Erik Barnouw, a Columbia University professor and historian of 
American television has said, "NET and the whole system might have soon collapsed."  NET would be the 
dominant force in educational television until the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was 
established in 1967.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Other events in the 1950s helped to taint commercial broadcasting and aid Ford's cause.  Public 
broadcasting's proponents would argue that commercial interests were vulnerable to McCarthyism and that 
noncommercial broadcasting was less susceptible to blacklisting and the "Red Scare."  The television quiz 
show scandals of the late 1950s also helped discredit commercial sponsorship.  After English instructor 
Charles Van Doren confessed that producers had coached him to give the right answers on a popular quiz 
program, Congress in 1960 passed legislation prohibiting rigged contests and requiring notice of paid 
consideration.  The "payola" scandals involving recording company payments to radio disk jockeys 
followed in 1961.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Under these circumstances the commercial networks came to see support for educational 
broadcasting as a good way to relieve the pressure from Congress while transferring requirements for 
public service programming to a third party. As one commercial broadcaster told an interviewer, "PBS got 
the crazies off our backs."  From its inception, then, public broadcasting has been a servant of many 
masters. It was the result of a deal struck in the 1950's which has not come undone.  Commercial 
broadcasters seeking to maximize profits and reduce congressional interference sealed a pact with 
academic and foundation professionals seeking prestige, money, and influence.
</FONT><P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>USING PULL TO GET A TV STATION IN NEW YORK<BR></FONT></B></I><P><FONT SIZE=2>There was no national program schedule in educational television's early years.  Viewership of the mostly 
UHF stations was extremely sparse, and the quality of their instructional programs was low.  Almost none 
of Ford's money had gone to the creation of original programming.  And out of constitutional concerns, no 
federal funds were used to produce programming for educational stations in the 1950's.  John F. White, 
NET president from 1958 to 1969, adamantly opposed federal support, warning that a domestic United 
States Information Agency was a danger to democracy.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The major purpose of the NET organization was to overcome the shortage of quality 
programming.  But NET was not a genuine network in the manner of NBC, CBS, or ABC.  Instead, it 
syndicated programs to educational television stations by bicycling films and tapes from station to station.  
In fact, a Ford Foundation grant enabled many stations to purchase their first videotape recorders in 
exchange for using NET materials in their broadcasts.  Still, John White wanted to create a national 
educational "fourth network," and he pushed for electronic interconnections over telephone lines and for 
more national programming, often against the objections of local university stations that had their own 
priorities.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>White's most important accomplishment was to establish an educational television station in New 
York City.  Although it was the nation's cultural and media center, New York had no educational non-
commercial television station until WNET was launched in 1962.  White understood that this single station 
would promote the political cause of his entire NET system.  He was right.  As television critic Martin 
Mayer has observed, "The breakthrough in non-commercial television came in 1962, when a self-
perpetuating nonprofit corporation raised the money to buy channel 13 in New York.  Educational 
television lost its state-college, school-system image and became something the New York-based national 
media started to discuss more seriously.  Congress responded with the first appropriations to help build and 
equip non-commercial stations, and Ford escalated its support."</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>White decided that the New York station had to be on a VHF channel because VHF had a better 
quality signal than UHF, where most educational stations were found.  To facilitate plans to purchase such 
a station, he assembled some of the wealthiest and most influential men in the city in the fall of 1959.  
They included Standard Oil heir John D. Rockefeller III, New York University chancellor George 
Stoddard, Corning Glass chairman Arthur A. Houghton, Jr. and New York Life chairman Devereux C. 
Josephs.  In November 1960, he met again with Josephs as well as Howard C. Sheperd, retired chairman of 
First National City Bank, and Henry G. Fischer, who later served as NET's FCC attorney.  As a result, 
Fischer tendered a $4 million offer to purchase station WNTA in Newark, New Jersey on February 9, 
1961.  The owner was National Telefilm Associates, whose chairman was a New York producer, Ely 
Landau.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Meanwhile, White had met with his friend Charles Heald,  president of the Ford Foundation 
(before Bundy)  to secure Ford's help on the purchase.  Heald's only condition was that NET not be 
publicly identified with the station's purchase.  White and Heald agreed that the New York station could 
not be perceived as more important to NET than any of the other 79 stations then subscribing to the 
network.  Rural stations were already worrying that NET might be "going New York" when its corporate 
headquarters earlier had moved from Ann Arbor to Manhattan.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>White also met with FCC Chairman Newton Minow.  Minow's primary interest was to keep the 
station out of commercial hands.  "As far as I'm concerned," he threatened Ely Landau at the time, "we're 
going to get a non-commercial station in there, one way or the another.  I don't know how yet, but I'm 
going to be very straight with you.  I'm going to oppose any transfer to another commercial licensee."  In 
other words, Minow intended to use his power as a regulator to force Landau to sell his station to the group 
he preferred.  Minow unsuccessfully tried to persuade his fellow FCC commissioners to pass a rule 
requiring cities with seven VHF channels to set aside one channel for educational broadcasting.  However, 
the FCC did agree to a special inquiry, which created a credible threat.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>On May 9, 1961, Minow delivered his "vast wasteland" speech.  "The public is your beneficiary," 
he said to the assembled broadcasters.  "If you want to stay on as trustees [of the airwaves], you must 
deliver a decent return to the public -- not only to your stockholders."  Minow went on to differentiate 
between shows he found worthwhile -- "CBS Reports," "The Twilight Zone," and Fred Astaire -- and the 
westerns and police dramas (many now regarded as classics) he scorned for their violence and 
simplemindedness.  And he denounced the "screaming, cajoling, offending" commercials that paid for such 
programming.  At a later press conference President Kennedy chimed in:  "Mr. Minow has attempted not to 
use force but to use encouragement in persuading the networks to put [on] better children's programs, more 
public service programs."  Then JFK tried to calm those who feared greater government involvement in 
broadcasting: "I don't know of anyone -- and Mr. Minow has already denied -- changing the basic 
relationship which now exists."</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In fact, the chairman of the FCC had made clear to the American public how federal funding for 
educational broadcasting would be justified, and the President had endorsed his position.  Although most 
non-commercial broadcast frequencies were still unused, educators were determined not to relinquish them 
to the private sector.  In 1962 the federal government authorized $32 million dollars in matching grants for 
the construction of educational television facilities.  The educators and foundation heads had secured a 
beachhead to federal money and power over educational broadcasting and would use it for their political 
purposes.</FONT><P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>BRINGING UP BABY: CARNEGIE AND FORD SIRE PBS<BR></FONT></B></I><P><FONT SIZE=2>The 1960's were the most important decade in the development of public broadcasting.  "Public" replaced 
"educational" television under the aegis of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.  In 1964, the federal Office of 
Education sponsored an educational broadcasting conference whose most significant result was the 
formation the next year of the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television.  It looked at issues in 
long-range finance.  When MacGeorge Bundy and Fred Friendly arrived at the Ford Foundation in 1966 
they focused on NET's potential for news and "public affairs" (i.e. political) programs unconstrained by a 
popular audience or commercial advertising.  Bundy had doubled to $40 million the annual budget of 
Ford's Division of National Affairs and he saw educational television as an outlet to promote "public 
discussion of issues which are controversial."  That meant Ford's agenda to shore up Great Society 
measures in race relations, poverty programs, and community action.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Bundy and Friendly drew up ambitious plans for satellite programming distribution and the 
establishment of a national broadcasting network.  At its peak the foundation was spending $100 million a 
year on educational television, sponsoring NET projects to influence the development of local and regional 
flagship stations around the country.  What Ford really needed now was a way to more clearly promote its 
political agenda on the most powerful station under its control in the largest market in the country, New 
York.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In January 1967, the Carnegie Commission delivered its report and almost answered Ford's every 
wish (Ford had actually paid for some of Carnegie's costs).  It called for a Corporation for Public 
Television, guaranteed federal support of educational stations, the establishment of two production centers 
and telephone or satellite facilities to make possible live broadcasts to the entire network.  In short, it 
recommended the basis for public broadcasting as it is today.  Legislation was introduced in Congress and 
LBJ declared his support for passage of the Public Television Act.  In 1967 Johnson signed the bill 
establishing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The baby sired by the great Foundations had finally been born.</FONT><P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Dramas of Donorship</FONT></B><P>by Robert Huberty<BR><P><FONT SIZE=2>Waldemar A. Nielsen, <I>Inside American Philanthropy: The Dramas of Donorship</I> (University of 
Oklahoma Press, 1996), 279 pages.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The transfer of private wealth from one generation to the next will soon reach astounding 
magnitudes.  Assuming that fortunes currently accumulated will continue to grow, it has been estimated 
that Americans will inherit $225 billion annually for the next forty years, an amount totalling $3.2 trillion 
by the year 2010 and $10.3 trillion by 2040.  It is also estimated that one percent of all heirs will receive 
one-third of the wealth transfer, nine percent will receive the second third, and the rest of us will get the 
remainder.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Waldemar Nielsen, author of <I>The Big Foundations</I> (1972) and <I>The Golden 
Donors</I> (1985), ponders what this will mean for philanthropy.  As of 1994 there were about 39,000 
American foundations with combined assets of $196 billion.  Nielsen predicts that if only two percent of 
estimated private wealth is dedicated to philanthropy it is likely that the number of American foundations, 
their assets and their grantmaking will double by 2010.  That's only thirteen years away.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Inside American Philanthropy</I> is a fast-paced survey of dozens of American donors and 
the foundations they created.  Neither a scholarly history nor a research analysis of current philanthropic 
practices, it wears its learning lightly and its opinions are couched in careful and discreet language.  Yet 
Nielsen is a preeminent observer of the foundation scene, and the authority of his prescriptive judgments is 
implicit in the little parables he tells.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>For Nielsen the most salient feature of American philanthropy is that it is giving by individuals.  
No matter that their staffs think themselves professional and their procedures grow bureaucratic, American 
foundations are the creations of individual donors.  Each donor is differently motivated and all take 
distinctive courses of action.  The resulting "dramas of donorship" vary: some develop into heroic odyssey 
(Andrew Carnegie) while others take on the appearance of tragedy (Edwin Land) and farce (Andy Warhol).  
Good intentions yield bad results and vice versa.  Nothing can be taken for granted about the future 
creation of foundations because each donor is differently motivated, has a different end in mind, and 
chooses different means to achieve it.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Nielsen's book is a collection of stories.  California's Arnold O. Beckman, who has advanced 
scientific knowledge through the discriminating distribution of major gifts during his lifetime, is a 
philanthropist in the classic mold.  More innovative is George Soros, who is using his wealth to open 
markets and promote political integration in the formerly Communist states of Europe at the same time that 
he is wheeling and dealing to make money in those markets.  Nielsen applauds the scope and creativity of 
Soros's giving but worries that it may move beyond "its proper boundaries."  He says nothing about Soros's 
giving for drug legalization.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Arts philanthropy seems especially prone to high-handed and questionable behavior.  The uranium 
tycoon Joseph Hirshhorn seems to have outsmarted the federal government by giving it his enormous but 
less than mediocre art collection on condition that the Smithsonian build a museum on the Mall with his 
name on it.  And Occidental Petroleum's Armand Hammer for years hindered sensible art planning by the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  It deferred to his demands because it expected to get his art 
collection, only to discover that he was building his own museum down the street.  Such entertaining 
examples are reminders that philanthropy involves dealmaking as well as generosity.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Nielsen also identifies new trends in philanthropy.  For instance, it is likely that women will have 
more power over philanthropy as more become successful entrepreneurs or inherit vast estates (a 
consequence of the "unlimited marital deduction" permitted by tax reforms in 1986).  Women now create 
about one-quarter of new foundations.  One welcome result, Nielsen speculates, is that foundations 
increasingly will stress the importance of family life.  But he also notes that women seem more apt to treat 
private giving as an initial investment in social programs whose upkeep can then be transferred to the 
federal government.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The notion that private foundations should fund ideas to make government more active is another 
recent development.  Nielsen gives major credit to Mary Lasker, president of the Albert and Mary Lasker 
Foundation, for promoting the concept of foundations as  public interest lobbyists.  Beginning in the 1940s, 
she helped launched the war on cancer and lobbied Franklin Roosevelt for government funding of medical 
research.  The Lasker Foundation also pioneered such then-innovative devices as soliciting celebrity 
endorsements for disease prevention, offering public awards for achievements in medical journalism, and 
publishing an annual health fact book.  This makes her in Nielsen's book "one of the half-dozen greatest 
American philanthropists ever."</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If it is ironic that philanthropists who made their money in the marketplace should want to see 
government spending replace it, it is doubly so that Nielsen should have such confidence that government 
can carry out their intentions.  Whatever their flaws and idiosyncracies, individual donors are Nielsen's 
heroes.  They are the driving force behind what might be considered a final stage of capitalism: the urge to 
give away voluntarily the wealth that one has spent a lifetime acquiring.  Donors fuel philanthropy's vessels 
and set the course; foundation executives only steer.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, Nielsen's convictions are so strong that he makes a concluding argument against 
foundation perpetuity.  Using the example of the Carnegie Corporation, Nielsen shows how chance and 
circumstances have shaped its leadership and grantmaking since Andrew Carnegie's death in 1919.  Nielsen 
has a high regard for the post World War II initiatives of Carnegie president John Gardner and his 
successors, but he thinks Carnegie might just as easily have followed other unnamed prominent 
foundations into "stagnation, fragmentation, and bureaucratization of programs."</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Waldemar Nielsen looks forward to the next century's explosion of private wealth and the 
prospects for a flood of major giving by individuals.  Whatever his own political convictions, this makes 
<I>Inside American Philanthropy</I> a socialist's nightmare.</FONT><P>

<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">You made a valuable contribution to unmasking the Ford Foundation's ethnic agenda with the 
insightful and very informative article by Linda Chavez and Jorge Amselle ["Inside the Ford Foundation's 
Plan to Split Apart America,' vol.1, no.10].</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">Chavez and Amselle are absolutely on target when they describe the leaders of La Raza and 
MALDEF as crated and "kept" by Ford Foundation funding and in their description of how these self-
styled Latino leaders do not represent what a majority of Latinos perceive to be in their best interest.  
Nevertheless these Ford Foundation-nurtured organizations merit close scrutiny because they exert political 
influence and they tned to shape news in the Spanish media.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A good example is California's Proposition 187 initiative. During the petition phase, opinion 
polling found that about a three-fifths majority of Latinos supported the measure. Alarmed by these results, 
the Latino activist groups launched a major public relations campaign to convince Latinos that the measure 
was racist and inspired by anti-Latino sentiment. By the time the vote took place, the Latino vote in support 
had fallen to about 40 percent.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Latino organizations and their supporters in the Spanish-speaking media have also conducted 
major efforts to convince Latinos that immigration reform is racist-inspired and anti-Latino. Yet, as Chavez 
and Amselle document, Latino opinion still favors reduced immigration.  It is not hard to figure out why.  
The survey data indicate that the strongest support for immigration reduction among Latinos is by those 
who immigrated themselves most recently, and whose job might be readily taken by another new 
immigrant.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even though the Latino activist organizations have been cowed by public opinion for the moment 
into dropping defense of illegal immigration, that still is on their agenda, albeit in disguise.  That really is 
what the call during the Hispanic March for an extension of the amnesty for illegal aliens was all about. 
Yet, in one of the ironies of having so much money to spread around, the Ford Foundation also funded 
research on the conditions of the US migrant labor workforce that came to the conclusion that their best 
hope for the future lies in restricting the supply of illegal aliens taking those jobs. A Latino leader who 
wanted to advance the working conditions of his fellow Latinos would be a strong supporter of a system of 
verifiable identification along with employer sanctions against employing illegal aliens. Instead it appears 
that the Ford Foundation-backed Latino leaders are focused only on building the size of their supposed 
constituency as fast as possible through wide-open immigration.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Your readers who want to pursue information on the Ford Foundation's 
social agenda with Latinos might want to read <I>Importing Revolution: Open Borders and the Radical 
Agenda</I>, by William Hawkins. Like Chavez and Amselle's article, and Georgie Anne Geyer's 
investigative reporting, it documents how the Ford Foundation has been relentlessly pursuing a social 
policy designed to remake the American society in ways that most of us would oppose.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Why would a &quot;Hoosier&quot; concert pianist
interrupt his musical careeer to found a Washington think-tank?</FONT></B>
<P>
by Laurence Jarvik<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>By any measure Dr. Balint Vazsonyi has had a remarkable
life. A refugee who fled his native Hungary after the failure
of the 1956 revolution, he is a concert pianist who has performed
on four continents, including the complete cycle of Beethoven
sonatas in New York, London, and Boston. He is also a historian,
professor, businessman, producer and host of  television documentaries
on Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms, a cultured man of the
world who has lived in Budapest, Vienna and London. Yet at the
same time he is a middle-American family man, a loving father
and husband who studied at Florida State University in Tallahassee,
and who taught music at Indiana University in the 1970's and 80's.
His favorite film is Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,
he once ran for mayor of Bloomington on the Republican ticket,
and his favorite television program is  Seinfeld.  Last year he
moved to the Watergate apartments and became director of the Center
for the American Founding at the Potomac Foundation in McLean,
Virginia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Very few Americans have the special gifts Vazsonyi
possesses.  &quot;Balint was a very gifted young pianist when
I knew him at Florida State,&quot; recalls Ellen Taafe Zwilich,
today Carnegie Hall's Pulitzer-prize winning composer-in-residence.
When he performed in London The Times declared, &quot;Beethoven
himself might have played his sonatas much as Mr. Vazsonyi did.&quot;
Daniel F. McDonald, president of the Potomac Foundation, recruited
the pianist for his team of experts after hearing Vazsonyi speak
and play at the Smithsonian Institution.  &quot;He  represented
a special intellectual resource,&quot; he said.  &quot;There's
no one else like him.&quot; McDonald backed Vazsonyi's plan for
the Center for the American Founding because he felt it was important
to &quot;frame policy dialog in terms of the most fundamental
considerations&quot; -- the Constitution and the founding principles
which inform it, principles which have been incorporated into
something Vazsonyi calls his &quot;Reaffirmation of the American
Founding,&quot; a document which has been signed by scores of
public figures.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We therefore resolve actively to oppose those practices
which are in direct contradiction to the American Founding and
reaffirm our commitment to its basic principles,&quot; reads the
conclusion to the document Vazsonyi has circulated to the nation's
policy elites and thousands of ordinary citizens across America
who have heard him on radio talk shows.  He calls his reaffirmation
campaign &quot;Re-Americanization&quot; in a September 1996 National
Review article. And his efforts are beginning to pay off. The
1996 Republican platform contained a commitment to the American
Founding. And there may be Congressional hearings on the American
Founding in the next Congress if Vazsonyi has his way. He calls
his political agenda simply &quot;American&quot; and says the
issues at stake are neither Democratic nor Republican; rather
they are the fundamental principles which undergird what he sees
as the unparalled success of this nation over two centuries. In
the National Review Vazsonyi declared: &quot;By the other side
I do not mean true Democrats: indeed many of them  might seize
the moment to reaffirm their American foundations. No: I refer
to those whose ideas clearly derive from opposing doctrine.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The opposing doctrine, says Vazsonyi, &quot;has 
worn many labels -- all variations on socialist philosphy.&quot;
Socialism depends on dividing people: Hitler used race and nationality,
Lenin and Stalin mostly class. The outcome is the same. Germany
and Russia oppressed Vazsonyi's native Hungary for many years,
and his family experienced persecution under both regimes.  He
perceives no real difference between the various forms of tyranny
he endured and sees a continuous struggle between their forces
and the free world. World War I, World War II and the Cold War
were, in the Vazsonyi analysis,  episodes in a century-long attempt
by socialist forces to achieve world domination, opposed consistently
by English political thought representing freedom and respect
for the rights of the individual.  English has given us the word
fairness,&quot; he says. &quot;No other language has yet come
up with even a translation of this word.&quot; He has presented
this perspective in newspaper articles, journals of opinion, and
faxes titled &quot;The Vazsonyi Analyis&quot; as well as in speaking
appearances at venues as varied as the International Monetary
Fund, the National Press Club, the Library of Congress, the Leadership
Institute and the International Platform Association.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Vazsonyi's most important essay, written for the
Potomac Foundation in 1995, is called &quot;The Battle For America's
Soul.&quot; It traces the origins of America's founding principles
to English political thought, and the current proliferation of
group rights mostly to German philosophy. The latter has acquired
bridgeheads in the media and the entertainment industry, and undermined
the traditional political health of American universities. Vazsonyi
speaks from personal  experience on college campuses.  He was
a professor of music at Indiana University and later dean of music
at the New World School of the Arts in Florida. While teaching
at Indiana in 1991, Vazsonyi confronted an organizer who arrived
on campus to co-ordinate opposition to Desert Shield  for a left-wing
group called &quot;the Committee Against the War in the Middle
East.&quot;The Bloomington Herald-Times did not identify C. Clark
Kissinger as anything other than an &quot;author.&quot; Vazsonyi
investigated and discovered that not only were there no books
by this Kissinger in his University library, but that he was a
professional anarchist whose ideal was the Chinese Cultural Revolution.
The lcoal paper did not disclose that the &quot;peace&quot; group
teach-in featured books by Marx and Trotsky, nor that a student
spokesman defined himself as &quot;a Marxist.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Outraged at the deception by the only newspaper in
his community, Vazsonyi organized a &quot;Stand Up for America
Alliance.&quot;  He confronted then-Congressman Frank McCloskey
at a town meeting and took issue with what he thought were McCloskey's
irresponsible statements against U.S. government policy in the
Gulf. Vazsonyi found himself greeted with applause and enthusiasm
by the crowd. He was approached to run for Mayor of Bloomington
as a Republican, a town as liberal as Berkeley, California or
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Although he lost, Vazsonyi had caught
the political bug. He started sending out faxes to his friends
and acquaintances that they called &quot;V-grams,&quot; containing
his perspective on political developments. He joined the Potomac
Foundation as a fellow in 1993, and in 1995 moved to Washington
to oversee the Center for the American Founding, carrying his
struggle to the heart of the American Leviathan.<BR>

In June, author Joe Maxwell attended the 
first-ever reunion of Booker T. Washington's descendants, which 
was held at the institution Washington founded, the 
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He records here his impressions of 
 the legacy of this great man.</font>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<P>
<a name="1">
<BR>
<P>Everything at Tuskegee seems to have changed for 
Ethelda Murray Hockett.  The room where once she learned 
the trade of &quot;domestic science&quot; is now a lavish testament to 
the man she reveres.  At one end of this massive boardroom, 
a life-size oil portrait of her uncle, Booker T. 
Washington, gazes from behind Mrs. Hockett's graying 
90-year-old head. Seated in her wheelchair, Mrs. Hockett has 
joined about 100 other relatives at a first-ever reunion 
of Washington's family.
<P>While Mrs. Hockett's creamy brown face registers 
justifiable pride, she also registers a melancholic hint of 
sorrow and regret as she wonders aloud what her uncle would 
think of his school today.
<P>&quot;You see,&quot; she notes in a wistful whisper, &quot;they've 
gotten away from the trades.&quot;
<P>In fact, Tuskegee University, a school founded with 
a $2,000 Alabama state grant in 1881 on the premise 
that every graduate should master basic academic 
disciplines and a marketable trade, no longer even has a &quot;trade 
building.&quot; Instead, the scores of stately Greek Revival 
brick buildings that Mr. Washington's early students built 
with their own hands are now completely devoted to 
&quot;higher&quot; academia.
<P>&quot;I have been told that the reason there has been such 
a transition is that the emphasis is more on the trades in 
higher development and sciences,&quot; continues Mrs. Hockett. 
&quot;Of course, in those early days, Dr. Washington was 
interested in young people who came to the school learning to use 
their hands so they could really help their family.&quot;
<P>Mr. Washington's niece is old enough to 
remember hearing her uncle preach his dignity-through-work 
vision for climbing out of slavery.  &quot;There is no position, 
however high in science or letters or politics, that I would 
withhold from any race, but I would have the foundation clear,&quot; 
Mr. Washington once said.  His goal crossed lines of race 
or class: &quot;Usefulness . . . is the supreme end of education.&quot; 
<P>Early in this century Mr. Washington's 
philosophical rivals overtook him, and they still reign today.  Where 
Mr. Washington emphasized respect earned, modern 
elitists have emphasized rights possessed.  Today, politicians 
and reporters now frequently babble that man's highest goal is education, 
defined most often in the narrow sense of 
a college degree.  Little is said about the usefulness of 
one's schooling.
<P>Yet market realities today vindicate Mr. 
Washington's wisdom: all-too-familiar are stories of college 
graduates who either can't find a job in their field, or find they 
have pursued a college degree that has prepared them for 
nothing useful.
<P>In the name of equality, Washington's opponents 
have virtually demanded that a college education be available 
to and sought by all, regardless of desires or talents.  No 
one, they suggest, should have to endure a life of manual labor.
<P>
This, of course, was just the sort of thinking 
Washington's life and words refute: &quot;The ambition to secure an 
education was most praiseworthy and encouraging.  The idea, 
however, was too prevalent that, as soon as one secured a 
little education, in some unexplainable way he would be 
free from most of the hardships of the world, and, at any 
rate, could live without manual labour.&quot; 
<P>
But Washington's opponents actually have erased 
the very thing they sought to achieve: options.  
Twenty-two-year-old John McLeod is a good example.  He feels 
torn between a truly valuable career and society's 
expectations. &quot;Part of me says that I ought to go on to college and get 
a degree just for the sense of accomplishment and 
because that is what society says I ought to do,&quot; confesses the 
lanky Mr. McLeod, adorned in a hairnet at the bagel shop 
where he works while considering his future goals.  &quot;But the 
other part of me says that I'm good with my hands--I can 
make a good living as a welder.&quot;
<P>Twice Mr. McLeod has entered Tennessee universities, only to exit 
without any clear goals.  He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, to apprentice as 
a welder.  &quot;I think I could make a living as a tradesman,&quot; he says. &quot;I'd like 
to have the option of schooling. . . .  But if I enjoy, say, being a mechanic or welder, I want to do 
it without any feelings of guilt or reservation because 
society might look down on a blue-collar job.&quot;
<P>Today's students often forgo the necessary and 
difficult training they need for a promising career in the 
trades. Many prefer the shiny bauble of an academic degree but 
no job prospects.
<P>
<a name="2">
<P><B>Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois</B>
<P>Booker T. Washington foresaw the problem of the dumbing down of America.  He did not diminish the 
importance of ideas, but he showed the earthy wisdom of 
someone who does not need the accolades of others.  Throughout 
his life, Washington was attacked mostly by Northern 
liberals, including W.E.B. Du Bois, who argued that blacks 
could not achieve equal status with whites except by radical, 
top-down intervention.  Washington championed work; Du 
Bois called for political action.  By the time Washington died 
in 1915, Du Bois seemed to have won the argument, 
especially given the establishment of Jim Crow laws in the South 
to impede black economic progress.  Washington soon 
was being called an &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot;
<P>&quot;Booker T. Washington was dealt one of the 
toughest hands of any black leader in American history,&quot; 
conservative black economist Thomas Sowell has written.  
Washington, says Sowell, understood that in the post-Civil 
War South, the fates of the black and white race were inextricably 
linked; merely looking at the statistical mix of the region70 percent white, 
30 percent blackmade that point clear. &quot;Washington was able to enlist 
the support of some whites by arguing that blacks would either help lift up the 
South or help to drag it down,&quot; says Sowell.
<P>
In actuality, argues Sowell, Du Bois and Washington were  
opposite sides of the same coin.  Du Bois concentrated his energy 
on ending the segregation which was held in place by the majority 
of whites, while  Washington focused on &quot;the internal 
self-development of blacks.&quot;  This led him to seek 
out and nurture positive relationships with those whites who would 
support his efforts.  &quot;The net result was that Washington was 
often praising whites of good will, while Du Bois was 
attacking whites of ill will,&quot; writes Sowell.
<P>
Both men recognized that, no matter when civil 
rights were secured, diligent, hard work would always be 
required for self-improvement.  Both men worried about those 
in their race who would seek a hollow sort of advancement 
that circumvented diligent labor.  Du Bois, notes Sowell, 
spoke of &quot;the Great Lack which faces our race in the 
modern world, lack of Energy,&quot; which he attributed to 
&quot;indolence&quot; growing out of tropical origins and which had now 
become a kind of &quot;social heredity.&quot;  Du Bois doubted that 
merely achieving certain rights would lead to the immediate 
improvement of his people: &quot;Some few would be 
promoted,&quot; observed Du Bois.  Nevertheless, &quot;the mass would 
remain as they are&quot; until the younger generation began to 
&quot;try harder&quot; as the race &quot;lost the omnipresent excuse for 
failure: prejudice.&quot;
<P>&quot;Du Bois' assessment of the black masses at that time 
was not very different from that of Booker T. Washington, 
who characterized many of them as sunk into `listless 
indifference, or shiftlessness, or reckless bravado,'&quot; asserts  Sowell.
<P>Over the long haul, however, the two men pursued 
different strategies.  Du Bois chose to concentrate his energies 
for improving his race on the &quot;talented tenth,&quot; those blacks 
who had been freed and gained social development before 
the Civil War.  Washington, on the other hand, staked his 
claim on improving the lives of the other 90 percent, those 
who lacked education and opportunities. Washington 
urged blacks to envision work as a divine right to be 
exercised along with the vote.  Washington also urged them to be 
self-reliant rather than reliant on whites, and he warned them 
not to be sidetracked by the &quot;geegaws&quot; of their 
newfound freedom whether they were material possessions or 
legal rights. Although the school now seems focused on 
the &quot;talented tenth&quot; approach,  Tuskegee Institute was 
founded to uphold Washington's teachings.
<P>In <I>The Future of the American Negro,</I> Washington  
states: &quot;An individual or a race that is strong enough, is 
wise enough, to disregard makeshifts, customs, prejudices, 
alluring temptations, deceptions, imitationsto throw off 
the mask of unreality and plant itself deep down in the clay, 
or on the solid granite of nature, is the individual or the 
race that will crawl up, struggle up, yes even burst up; and in 
the effort of doing so will gain strength that will command 
for it respect and recognition.&quot;
<P>Sadly, however, Washington's basic teachings on 
the dignity of hard work and earned respect have lost 
authenticity in modern America.  Being grateful for an 
opportunity, or the idea of  &quot;starting at the bottom and working to 
the top,&quot; has been supplanted.  In the process, too many 
people of all races have recklessly dismissed altogether the great principles of living espoused by Booker T. Washington.

<P><B>The Washington Family Reunion</B>
<P> The Booker T. Washington reunion was attended 
by nearly 100 people.  The vast majority knew very little 
about their great ancestor's life, much less about his 
teachings. Almost none of Mr. Washington's descendants live 
either philosophically or geographically near the soil of 
Tuskegee. In fact, many of the descendants had for years concealed 
the fact that they were Washington's offspring.
<P>The widow of Booker T. Washington III, Joyce 
Washington, related to one group at the reunion how her husband, 
 Washington's own grandson, had been ashamed of 
his ancestry at times and had distanced himself 
geographically and emotionally.  &quot;Booker was not telling people in 
New York what his name was,&quot; she said.  &quot;He went through 
this whole story about what a difficult time he had with 
the name, and especially in New York City, where there are so many 
minorities.&quot;
<P>But, she says, later in life he began to see the value of his 
grandfather's teachings.  Similarly, many at the reunion seemed to realize for 
the first time the greatness of the man and his teaching.  Sarah Thrash is 
the great-granddaughter of Booker T. Washington; she attends church 
at the Allen Temple in Oakland, California, where several stained 
glass windows depict historic black figures including Frederick 
Douglass and Booker T. Washington. Though she was his 
direct descendent, Mrs. Thrash kept quiet about her relation 
to Washington.  But after the reunion weekend, she said 
she had gained a much greater appreciation for the man.  
&quot;It gives me a great sense of pride,&quot; she said. &quot;After 
this weekend, I'll feel so much more pride looking up at 
that window.&quot;

Throughout the Washington reunion weekend, Edith Washington, one of four living granddaughters of 
the Tuskegee legend, played the role of proud 
grandparent, great-grandparent, and great-great-grandparent.  At an 
introductory  gathering of the family outside Washington's home, 
The Oaks, at the edge of Tuskegee University, Edithwith microphone 
in handproudly introduced virtually all of the estimated 100 
attendants by name and explained their place in the family tree.
<P>When she got to one name, 26-year-old Douglass 
Washington Morris, she gushed about the recent Tuskegee graduate.  &quot;And 
back there is Douglass Washington Morris,&quot; she said, noting his 
amazing heritage: his great-grandfather is Booker T. Washington, while his 
great-great-grandfather on his other side is Frederick Douglass.
<P>&quot;Douglass is a consultant with IBM in Chicago,&quot; 
Edith boasted. &quot;He makes $100,000 a year.&quot;
<P>Everyone laughed at her grandmotherly candor; 
Mr. Morris seemed a bit embarrassed.
<P>
<a name="4">
<P><B>Education for What?</B>
<P>&quot;There are too many people in the world who give 
their whole lives grasping at the shadow instead of the 
substance&quot; wrote Booker T. Washington.
<P>Eleven out of the 13 great grandchildren at the Booker 
T. Washington reunion have achieved college degrees: 
surely their forefather would be proud, especially since most of 
them seem actually to be using their advanced educationthe 
very thing Mr. Washington called for.
<P>As the Washington family gathered at the old Oaks 
home on the grounds of Tuskegee University, Tuskegee 
president Benjamin Payton commended them for returning to 
their forefather's home.  He explained how difficult it has been to 
continue raising the money the university needed to 
keep growing and thriving.  He reiterated that Tuskegee's 
effort to carry on the Washington tradition remains strong.
<P>
Yet Payton never bothered to mention that the 
university now has no vocational offerings in its catalogue. 
What would the champion of dirt farmers and manual 
laborers have thought of that?  Would he be pleased or dismayed 
that none of the nearly 100 descendants at the reunion earn 
their living in a trade?  When asked whatever happened to 
the Washington emphasis on trade school training alongside 
traditional academic training, President Payton replied: &quot;We 
think that the education of the whole person is extraordinarily 
important.  We do it now at a different level.  What was being done 
in 1881 was to meet a need at that time.  There were so many 
African Americans that needed a knowledge of how to make 
the transition from agrarian to industrial [society]. . . .  We 
don't need a Tuskegee training blacksmiths now. . . .  We need 
blacks trained in electrical engineering, in aerospace 
engineering, and in health sciences. . . .  All these are contemporary 
expressions of providing an education that meets the needs of 
today's society . . . and not just what was going on in ancient 
Greece and Rome.&quot;
<P>
<a name="5">
<P><B>Work toward Usefulness</B>
<P>Later in the weekend, Edith sat with Washington's 
three other living granddaughters at a table of honor. The 
remaining family members sat at tables according to their 
age. Edith called for quiet and introduced Ethelda 
Murray Hockett, &quot;the oldest living descendent of Booker T. 
Washington,&quot; and the clan hushed to hear her memories of 
their family hero.
<P>Her uncle, she says, would love the pristine 
modern Tuskegee campus, built by early students who rotated 
three days of vocational training with three days of 
academic schooling.  &quot;He wanted students to use the knowledge 
they had and learn trades,&quot; she said, noting quietly: &quot;The 
trade building is gone now.&quot;
<P>&quot;It has been replaced by engineering,&quot; injected Edith, 
&quot;a higher step up.&quot;
<P>Throughout the weekend, Edith and other elders 
urged their youth to attend special college admittance 
sessions being offered by Tuskegee's recruitment staff.  The role 
and value of vocational training, however, was never discussed.
<P>Contended Agnes Louise Washington O'Neal, 
Edith's sister: &quot;[Washington] was a man of his times.  Times 
have changed.&quot;
<P>Have times changed?  Or has our understanding of 
what the times need changedand for the worse?
<P>Booker T. Washington foresaw two courses that all 
Americans, regardless of color, could take.  One esteems a 
person for his degree of  work; the other merely esteems the 
degree worked for.  &quot;I would say to the black boy what I would 
say to the white boy, `Get all the mental development your 
time and pocketbook will allow,'&quot; said Washington.
<P>The earnest desire to work toward usefulness inspired Booker T. Washington.  
Today he would surely applaud those in his family whose work ethic has led them to 
become doctors and lawyers; but he would surely give an 
equally rousing round of applause to those whose hard work 
ethic has led them to become master carpenters or masons.
<P>At one point during the Tuskegee reunion, several 
family members visited a bronze statue that depicts the &quot;Wizard 
of Tuskegee&quot; standing to lift a veil from a kneeling black 
man whose face looks skyward.
<P>The statue begs this question: what does the veil 
symbolize?  Does it represent an ignorance of &quot;higher 
knowledge&quot; that is being removed?  Or does it represent the removal 
of another sort of ignorance: the myth that human dignity 
is rooted purely in the vocation chosen, rather than in 
the excellence of work done in a chosen vocation?  &quot;Any 
man,&quot; said Mr. Washington, &quot;regardless of color, will be 
recognized and rewarded in proportion as he learns to do 
something well, learns to do it better than anyone else, 
however humble.&quot;
<P>Life, he taught, is the greatest classroom, and its 
graduates earn the highest degree.  &quot;The person who has 
mastered something, who understands what he is doing . . . out in 
the world, master of himself everywhere, that person,&quot; said 
Mr. Washington, &quot;is a scholar.&quot;
<P>
<BR>
<a name="6">
<B>Where Have All the Tradesmen Gone?</B><BR>
<P>
Washington understood what was at stake: &quot;We 
shall prosper as we learn to dignify and glorify common labour 
and put brains and skill into the common occupations of life; 
shall prosper in proportion as we learn to draw the line between 
the superficial and the substantial, the ornamental gewgaws 
of life and the useful.  No race can prosper until it learns that 
there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem.&quot;
<P>And now, a hundred years later, corporate and 
small-town America is begging for tradesmen.  From bricklaying to 
tool-and-die work, the sort of high-skill, brain-and-brawn 
labor that Mr. Washington advocated is in rare supply but 
high demand.
<P>A recent Arthur Andersen Enterprise Group survey 
revealed that 25 percent of 919 small businesses surveyed 
fret over a dwindling supply of qualified workers in the 
trades. &quot;People have aimed for what was considered the most 
prestigious positions.  We don't have people for the other 
technologies,&quot; laments Julianne Inverso, student personal 
supervisor at Mercer County Vocational Technical Schools in 
Trenton, New Jersey.  At the Mercer County facility, students can 
be trained in air conditioning and refrigeration, auto body 
repair, business technology, computer operation, electrical 
construction, graphic arts, plumbing and heating, general 
building construction, and visual communicationsjust to name 
a few.  The student pool is diverse, from local teens learning 
a trade while attending  high school, to displaced members 
of the modern workplace.
<P>If holding a steady job and achieving a certain salary 
level are the measures, then Mercer's graduates may outdo 
those bound for college.  In 1995, Mercer County's facility 
graduated all of its 132 students. Only eight of 125 who 
later responded to a follow-up survey were unemployed, while 
86 had gone on to full- or part-time employment (some 
part-timers were attending college).
<P>While the historic reason for attending a university 
&quot;to learn to think&quot; has been supplanted by a utilitarian 
one, &quot;getting a job,&quot; growing numbers of today's students 
aren't even achieving that.
<P>The result is twofold.  First, the quality of education is 
 diminishing today: an Association for American 
Colleges survey reported that 78 percent of modern college 
graduates never take a Western history course; 77 percent avoid 
studying a foreign language; and 45 percent end-run even 
basic literature courses.  Second, less-learned college 
graduates leave school with their Holy Grail degree, only to find 
their cup empty as they are unable to find decent work.
<P>&quot;There is clearly a supply and demand problem for 
many manufacturers,&quot; says Michael Cantwell, national director 
of manufacturing at a management consulting firm, Grant Thorton, in a 
<I>Wall Street Journal </I>interview.
<P>The <I>Journal </I>article cites several examples of the paradox 
 in the American workforce: Lincoln Electric Company 
in Euclid, Ohio, currently has about 200 openings, with 
hourly pay ranging from $8.39 to $20.  While some openings are 
at the lowest rung of the plant, the company also needs 
tool-and-die makers, mold makers and machinists.
<P>But few of the thousands who apply for jobs at Lincoln 
can do high-school trigonometry or read technical drawings, 
and most don't show an aptitude for learning how to 
operate computer-controlled machines--skills that Lincoln says 
even entry-level workers need.
<P>Employees with certain skills are hot commodities.  
&quot;A journeyman welder is like a free agent in baseball,&quot; says 
Walt Elish, executive director of the Economic Development 
Corporation of Waukesha County, Wisconsin.  &quot;We can't 
find welders, we can't find tool-and-die makers, we can't 
find [computer-controlled] machine operators.&quot; He says 
such workers can earn from $35,000 to $50,000 a year, and it 
isn't uncommon for a good toolmaker to pull down $60,000 
with overtime.
<P>But to command those wages, today's factory 
workers need to use advanced math, have good communication 
skills and understand the use of computers.  Most 
high-school students with those abilities are college-bound.
<P>&quot;It is very frustrating,&quot; says Bruce Cable, Lincoln's 
employment manager, whose eight-person staff has 
screened thousands of candidates.  &quot;These days even if 
high-school students have C-minus grades, they can go to college.  
So, instead of getting the B student to handle a manual lathe, 
we are now getting the D student.&quot;
<P>Conservative columnist Don Feder has noted the 
same trend: &quot;Memo to incoming college freshmen: Most of you 
are wasting your parents' money, society's resources, and 
your own time.  The typical collegian would be better off at a 
trade school or in a job training program. . . .&quot;
<P>Feder quotes author William Henry III's 1994 book, 
<I>In Defense of Elitism</I>: &quot;For many adolescents . . . college 
is simply a holding pattern until they can get on with their 
lives. It is understandable that they should want to extend 
their youth and ponder their identities (or navels) for a bit; what 
is rather less clear is why they should do so at public as well 
as parental expense.&quot;
<P>Adds Feder: &quot;For most students, it's a cruel hoax; 
for families, an onerous burden to buy their progeny a 
paper credential.  For society, degree-worship is a huge and 
growing drain on the economy.
<P>&quot;And so, dear freshmen, heed those ads offering training 
in the operation of commercial vehicles or the art of dying 
hair and giving perms.  Compared to what you'll be doing for 
the next four years, this would be time well spent.&quot;
