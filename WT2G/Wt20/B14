Raylene and I were having a discussion with some friends last Saturcay<br>
afternoon, and the question came up, "Can Satan read a person's mind".<br>
<p>
Some members of the group said "definitely not", but couldn't come up<br>
with any Scriptural evidence, or even any quotes from EGW regarding<br>
this question. I wondered whether it was just wishful thinking to say<br>
that only God can read our thoughts.<br>
<p>
We have been charged with finding the answer before next weekend, so I<br>
thought that SDAnet would provide an invaluable resource in assisting<br>
us. So, to all the walking SOP libraries out there, (and even to those<br>
who just have the CD-ROM :-&gt; ), what is the consensus?<br>
<p>
(From personal experience I am inclined to think that maybe he can and<br>
does read my mind! Then again, maybe I *am* the devil. Who knows.)<br>

      I have done quite a bit of reading on this topic and there<br>
    are certain characteristics of "cults" as a "cult" is defined<br>
    in a Christian stance.  One of the most prominent is that "our<br>
    group is God's channel of real truth, while all others are<br>
    lost in error."  When an LDS or Jehovah's Witness comes to my<br>
    door and we talk, I get the impression that they consider it<br>
    a "weakness" that I belong to one of many denominations.  But<br>
    actully I consider it a strength. I am a member of the Evangelical<br>
    Free Church of Hershey.  Neither our local congregation nor our<br>
    Denomination as a whole claim exclusive right to God.  If you were to<br>
    put me in a room with an LDS, a Jehovah's Witness, and someone from<br>
    Worldwide church of God, they would all have something in common.<br>
    They would each either publically or silently be completed convinced<br>
    in his/her mind that there particular group was "truly God's church"<br>
    and that the others were off base and in turn in heretical groups.<br>
    Hmm...how does this work??  Obviously three would be wrong ??<br>
    I believe that God is bigger than my organization.  We have no<br>
    leader's that we must pay homage to.  We are free to worship and serve<br>
    the Lord, without the baggage of "exclusiveness".<br>
<p>
    Well, thats all I have time for........<br>

I'm reminded of an entertaining discussion back in the heady days of the <br>
Washington Institute for Contemporary Issues (which I believe is now<br>
defunct).  Messrs. Londis, Cox, and Branson were among many VIP's who<br>
visited<br>
Pittsburgh for Uplink 88, a congress for the yuppies of the Columbia Union.<br>
They were leading a forum on women in ministry.  After hearing some glowing <br>
descriptions about how well things were going in that hotbed of liberalism<br>
known as Sligo, I felt obliged to give a reality check to these gentlemen.<br>
<p>
I reminded them that they had crossed a set of mountains to get to Pittsburgh<br>
and that things were different on this side.  Then as now ordaining women<br>
elders was basically unthinkable to most of the congregation. (It may<br>
have been attempted this year for the first time, they have changed<br>
officers since I was last there).   Then in the smaller churches one has<br>
the problem that the few qualified women are smart enough not to want<br>
the job. (as opposed to the unqualified men who have no such<br>
restrictions.)<br>
<p>
But now we hear from Susan Harrington, a resident of that same hotbed of<br>
liberalism, that all is not well even in a place like Sligo where there<br>
have<br>
been women on the staff as long as I can remember.  No doubt there is<br>
great disappointment over the 1990 action that was taken not to ordain<br>
women <br>
to the gospel ministry.  <br>
<p>
We must remember that the fight to give equal representation to people of <br>
color in the SDA church was long-fought and is still far from over.  And the <br>
arguments given in that fight were of the same nature.  If the womens<br>
movement is likened to the civil rights movement, where are we today<br>
historically?  I would say about 1965.  By that time some politicians<br>
had started paying lip service to the idea of civil rights and some<br>
legislation had passed, but there were still much more gains to be made.<br>
In the SDA church in 1965, CUC and Southern were still segregated.<br>
<p>
It's my fear that we are already seeing a kind of tokenism for women<br>
such as there is for Blacks in the N. A. church.  It's common knowledge<br>
that certain<br>
positions in the leadership are reserved for people of color, to be specific<br>
the secretaries of most unions.  In this way people can pay lip service to <br>
advancing this group but still retain control.  <br>
<p>
Similarly, we are now seeing the appointment of a woman associate pastor <br>
to the staffs of large liberal churches mainly as a status badge. <br>
Unfortunately, these positions are often the first to fall to the budget<br>
axe, and also place the woman under a great deal of scrutiny.  If any <br>
new and innovative programs are started for women at the expense of<br>
meeting the demands of the saints in the hospice, the woman pastor is<br>
also in trouble.<br>
<p>
The women on this net didn't ignore the fact that a woman posted that<br>
there were problems, and several men posted back with essentially,<br>
"no, everything is OK."  I am not a subscriber to the feminist agenda <br>
in general but I have seen enough of my female friends be victimized by <br>
the sexism in the church to know that there are problems that must be <br>
addressed.  It is easier to defend against a cheap shot sometimes than <br>
to address the underlying issues that caused the person to raise it.<br>

This is a great example of the thinking man's church.  Why would a thinking woman want to attend?  Should we be thrilled with token representation when we compose more than 60% of the church?<br>

Another aspect of this issue that has not been addressed is that women<br>
are not the only ones being kept from positions of power within the SDA<br>
church. It has been my observation that if a man does not come from the<br>
proper school, or is not a doctor, than they are treated as second class<br>
citizens and are placed on the deacon track. Once there, I don't recall<br>
ever seeing them become elders. A women married to a doctor is treated<br>
with more dignity. Other such methods of clique tracking include relatives<br>
accomplishments vs. individual achievements. <br>
<p>
I also wonder why the whole issue of women in the ministry is allowed to<br>
distract us from our true mission. I have witnessed attempts from several<br>
groups (most noticeably TEAM) that employ feminist tactics for indoctrinated<br>
without allowing for intelligent discourse. Any reasoning that centers around<br>
societal changes vis-a-vis EGW's day for changing our position seems to me<br>
to be a secularization of the Adventist doctrine to gain political popularity<br>
I also heard a whining that women who chose to major in theology were being<br>
denied job opportunities. I might want to point out that I have been denied<br>
job opportunities because I don't work on the Sabbath. It would be lunacy<br>
to demand that a future employer should bend over backwards because I want<br>
his job. Nothing is keeping any SDA women from ministering outside the <br>
denominational hierachy. But then again, the pay wouldn't be as high, <br>
would it?<br>

<i>&gt; Raylene and I were having a discussion with some friends last Saturcay</i><br>
<i>&gt; afternoon, and the question came up, "Can Satan read a person's mind".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; us. So, to all the walking SOP libraries out there, (and even to those</i><br>
<i>&gt; who just have the CD-ROM :-&gt; ), what is the consensus?</i><br>
<p>
I'm no theologian, so this is probably 1 cent worth :)  <br>
<p>
Consider the possibility if Satan cannot read the mind.  Under that<br>
circumstance, he would need to rely on external evidence to find<br>
peculiar weaknesses to play on.  I'd say if this is the case, after<br>
6000 years of practice, he's a pretty good psychologist, expression<br>
reader, handwriting analyst, body language reader, and reader of<br>
other clues that give good ideas as to what is going on in the mind.<br>
<p>
Regardless of whether or not he can read actual thoughts, I doubt if<br>
he's confused often (unless God has some limits on him in this area,<br>
which will probably be confirmed by the SOP libraries if known to man :)<br>

Time to throw in two cents.<br>
<p>
I realize that women may not have all the power some want in the<br>
church everywhere, but I think decided leaps and bounds have been<br>
made.  In my current church (Kalamazoo) women are leaders in many<br>
areas, especially outreach programs, and are often up front talking<br>
about that and encouraging others to get involved.<br>
<p>
I attend a Sabbath School class that is taught by a lady and a man<br>
(alternate weeks) and there are at least two other classes in the<br>
church taught by women.  <br>
<p>
As for singles, my church does have a group for that (it's small at<br>
the moment - only about 6, but we have fun going on outings and planning<br>
interesting things to do).<br>
<p>
Single parents?  There is a small group in the church, and babysitting<br>
and support group is catered to as much as possible (though I must admit<br>
this program is relatively new).<br>
<p>
Women's groups?  There's a bundle going on around.  Personally they don't<br>
interest me, so I haven't attended any, but they're there (maybe this is<br>
from influence of Andrews University, which is within 100 miles?).<br>
<p>
This may not please everyone, but effort is being made to keep everyone<br>
included and not feeling lonely or overlooked.  Not 100% success, but<br>
not much else to do but try...<br>

To all those SDAnetters,<br>
<p>
I, too, have wondered if Satan can read minds, and although I still would<br>
like to do more research, I think there are at least two ways that one<br>
could take this discussion.<br>
	1. Being created by God, that he was not given the power to read<br>
		the minds of others.<br>
-OR-<br>
	2. Although created by God, he and all the other angels were<br>
		given the power to read the minds of the other beings.<br>
<p>
I personally believe that God did not give Satan that power to read<br>
minds, although over the observation of your life &amp; mine, he has been<br>
able to figure out what temptations would work best on you &amp; me.<br>

Cheryl writes valuable points about women in the SDA church. I do not doubt <br>
that these are things she has personally witnessed as I too have witnessed <br>
some of what she mentions. I would not argue that our church has dealt fairly <br>
or honestly in all ways with women's issues. I still believe that the things <br>
she mentions go on in Adventist churches.<br>
<p>
I do wish to point out that many SDA churches are dealing with women's issues.<br>
I have the privilege of pastoring a church in a conservative area in Northern <br>
California which has had ordained women elders since 1978. Women actively <br>
participate in all aspects of church ministry. And interestingly enough, there<br>
are as many men single parents as there are women. Please don't get the idea <br>
that we are in a liberal area or are just and unusual phenomena. Tracy is a <br>
very conservative town in a very conservative area.<br>
<p>
My bragging about my church is not self glorification for I have only been <br>
here for a few months. The credit all goes to dedicated lay people who took it<br>
upon themselves to study scripture and put into practice what they learned. If<br>
our church wishes to deal with issues such as women's ordination and the role <br>
of women in the church, I suggest reading V. Norskov Olsen's book on <br>
priesthood, ordination and the church. I don't recall the exact title but you <br>
can get it through the Adventist Book Center.<br>
<p>
I offer this not as an excuse for our failures toward women, but only as one <br>
example of an SDA church that has and continues to deal with women's issues. I<br>
might add that we also work hard to make certain that our young people have an<br>
active role in the church and its decisions.<br>

This is a great example of the thinking man's church.  Why would a thinking woman want to attend?  Should we be thrilled with token representation when we compose more than 60% of the church?<br>

I've always been uneasy about racism, sexism, and other "ism's" being <br>
supported by<br>
the church, from the Bible.  I don't think anyone is ever going to <br>
stand up in front of the<br>
GC session and say, "our missionaries have found another country to enter,<br>
and _replace_ their culture with our own."  No one is going to tell the <br>
truth, that prejudice<br>
is alive and well, on our school's campuses.  My high school principal <br>
took my girlfriend<br>
and I aside to encourage us to break up; Not because we were too young <br>
(me a senior),<br>
or sexually involved (which we weren't), but because we were of <br>
different races.<br>
"Well, why do you say that?", I asked.  "Because the Bible and Ellen G. <br>
White said so.",<br>
was the type of reply I got.<br>
<p>
We've got more *important* things to do with our time...<br>
The Numbers Game = educational endowments, tithes, baptisms; tradition, <br>
protecting<br>
"_the_ truth", filing lawsuits against sinners.  It's a bleak picture, <br>
once you really look at it.<br>
<p>
But it doesn't _have_ to be!  Any of us who are PRAYERFUL thinkers, can make a<br>
difference.  Our hearts, as a church are proud.  By surrendering to the <br>
will and character<br>
of God, I believe that many of our "ism's" will be taken away.  By <br>
*beholding* we become<br>
changed, from our earthly likeness, to God's divine likeness.<br>
<p>
It sounds too simple to be true!  Yet, thanks to my pastor doing a <br>
series on "Sin, sinless by<br>
making sin lists", many of us are finally accepting the simple gift of <br>
Christ's cleansing blood,<br>
and the power and fruits it bares in our daily lives.  This, in no way, <br>
means that being a<br>
Christian should make us status quo humans - - to the contrary!<br>

<i>&gt; Just wanted to respond to what woody said:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         "The Adventist church is a thinking mans church."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; . . . . . . . .</i><br>
<i>&gt; . . . . . . . .</i><br>
<p>
A friend of mine, who is not SDA, commented that ALL churches have their<br>
own way of contriving scripture to fit the the doctrines of their<br>
church.  He says he goes to a Pentecostal church because he enjoys the<br>
fellowship and the hi-tech program even though there is a lot of their<br>
theology that he does not agree with, including speaking in tongues.<br>
This suits him just fine because he has been taught that "love" is all<br>
that counts, i.e. being a loving Christian == Salvation.  So is of no<br>
concern to him that he differs on so many points of theology.  He finds<br>
that SDA theology comes the closest to his reading of the Bible, but<br>
but his wife thinks "SDAs are too legalistic".<br>
<p>
I have always thought of the SDA church as being the church for people<br>
who eagerly want to search out the church that comes the closest<br>
possible to teaching what the Bible teaches.  EGW certainly points us<br>
in that direction.  A people who are eager to follow the word of God<br>
regardless of the cost, to obey God rather than man, to do His<br>
commandments because we love Him.<br>
<p>
Perhaps, when Woody said "thinking man's church" he meant those who<br>
want to be serious students of the Bible and obedient to what they<br>
find rather than a church for intelectual theologians.<br>
<p>
The Catholic church claims to be a thinking man's church in that<br>
doctrine and conscience are ruled by the ordained ecclesiastic<br>
"thinking men" of the hierarchy.  The rest of the church are the<br>
peasents.  We are a thinking man's church in the Protestant sense that<br>
calls for church and state to be subservient to each man's<br>
conscience, made subservient to the Bible.  At least that is the<br>
church that was founded several years ago.  While other churches<br>
have their prophets that point their followers away from the Bible,<br>
or at least to distrust it in so many ways; the SDA church has a<br>
prophet who urges its membership to an ever deeper study of the Bible.<br>
Just as the Old Testament authenticates the New Testament.  So the<br>
entire Bible authenticates EGW as a prophet.  The BIble is our<br>
final creed, authority and authenticator of prophets, preachers and<br>
evangelists.  If they speak not accordingly, there is no light in them.<br>

[From Sue Harrington sue@cuc.edu]<br>
The argument that women like their position and fight to maintain this<br>
subordinate position has been used to say that African-Americans liked<br>
being owned and serving "pink" persons in authority.  Perhaps the reason<br>
oppressed persons fight to maintain that position could be--If a woman<br>
derives her identity as a support system to her man she may be<br>
uncomfortable when other women find their identity in a different way. <br>
She might feel personally threatened.<br>
<p>
If we continue to have the decision making bodies of the church composed<br>
almost entirely of "pink" males our church will continue to address<br>
men's issues and concerns; to allocate resources to projects that favor<br>
men's involvement.  <br>
<p>
Another argument that has been used in this discussion:  why should the<br>
church address women's issues it doesn't address men's issues.  Perhaps<br>
we are not even aware of what are men's issues because for so long they<br>
have been identified as the issues of mankind.  I am using the term here<br>
with my tongue in my cheek.  We claim to be talking about all people<br>
when in fact we are only talking about men.<br>
<p>
Another argument:  things will get better if we just leave it in the<br>
Holy One's hands and be patient.  Well, dear net contributors, it might<br>
be wise to look at the figures and you will see that women have less<br>
involvement now than they had 100 years ago, than they had 10 years ago.<br>
 We are not progressively getting more involvement we are instead being<br>
lulled to sleep by well meaning persons.<br>
<p>
If we are indeed followers of the Holy One who lived among us we must<br>
challenge the leadership as Jesus did.  Withholding financial support<br>
until the leadership of the church reflects the composition of its<br>
membership is perhaps the most effective method available to us.<br>

<i>&gt; church. It has been my observation that if a man does not come from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; proper school, or is not a doctor, than they are treated as second class</i><br>
<i>&gt; citizens and are placed on the deacon track. Once there, I don't recall</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever seeing them become elders. A women married to a doctor is treated</i><br>
<i>&gt; with more dignity. Other such methods of clique tracking include relatives</i><br>
<i>&gt; accomplishments vs. individual achievements. </i><br>
<p>
Hmmm, my father ran into this sort of thing.  He took a year off teaching<br>
to complete his doctoral degree.  He was a carpenter for that year.  I was<br>
at a new school that did not know him and his preaching and teaching abilities.<br>
Once he came to school to pick me up and found the principal fretting over <br>
a worship speaker cancelling out.  My father thought to be of help, and <br>
offered to fill it.  This was received with much surprise and distain.<br>
He was told that they'd find someone to cover it, not to worry.  Well, no<br>
one was found, and the worship was cancelled (just a gradeschool Monday<br>
morning worship).<br>
<p>
It was rather humorous looking from this side of things, but I doubt if<br>
it would be as humorous to a regular carpenter or other manual laborer.<br>
Because a person has not been trained to speak or teach doesn't mean they<br>
haven't learned.  I think it's important to dig for the real person rather<br>
than judging by externals.  Guess this is a growing process with the church<br>
too...<br>

I've been an Adventist all my life, gone to adventist schools all my life,<br>
and consider myself well versed in Adventist history.  I have never heard<br>
of the Jehovah's witnesses being a splinter group from the SDA church.<br>
Herb Armstrongs Worldwide Church of God, yes, Jehovah's witness no.<br>
<p>
[The Jehovah's Witnesses are not an offshoot per se because Russell himself,<br>
their founder, was never an SDA.  But he was heavily influenced by SDA <br>
teaching particularly with regards to the state of the dead.  SCT]<br>

I have a question that I would like some enlightened comments.  I DO NOT<br>
want to renew the discussion on salvation by works or faith.  What I want<br>
is for those that have different views on the role of works in salvation<br>
to comment on the purpose of "The Investigative Judgement".<br>
<p>
First, what is the IJ?<br>
What occurs during IJ?<br>
What is reviewed during IJ?<br>
Who is reviewed?<br>
Why are they reviewed?<br>
What decision is made during IJ?<br>
<p>
Then, explain to me (as you understand it) how works fit into this (if it does)?<br>
The obvious dilemma:  if we are saved by grace through faith and works are<br>
irrelevant, why is there an investigative judgement?  If works matter in the<br>
sense of reflecting our commitment and relationship to Christ, what is the<br>
purpose of the IJ?  If works matter a great deal and have impact on whether<br>
we are saved (by your own theology), is the IJ important and why?<br>
<p>
Thanks for your thoughtful replies.<br>

We've had a lot of responses to my posting about women in the SDA Church.<br>
(Mostly male because most SDAnetters are male.)  But here's one of the<br>
classical male "nonthinking" responses to a very real problem:<br>
<p>
"I also heard a whining that women who chose to major in theology were being<br>
denied job opportunities. I might want to point out that I have been denied<br>
job opportunities because I don't work on the Sabbath. It would be lunacy<br>
to demand that a future employer should bend over backwards because I want<br>
his job. Nothing is keeping any SDA women from ministering outside the<br>
denominational hierachy. But then again, the pay wouldn't be as high,<br>
would it?<br>
<p>
This is the type of thinking that infuriates the oppressed.  Why should<br>
women have to go outside the denomination to minister?  Do SDA men go<br>
to the seminary and plan for a life of ministry OUTSIDE the SDA Church?<br>
How many SDA ministers actually take a ministerial job OUTSIDE the SDA<br>
Church?  And the pay?  The pay would probably be higher OUTSIDE the SDA<br>
Church!  But women who are totally committed to the truths and beliefs<br>
of the SDA Church would have a difficult time ministering under other<br>
doctrinal frameworks just as any SDA male.  Yes, women who major in<br>
theology are being actively and oppressively denied jobs in the SDA<br>
church.  Do they not have an equal duty and right to serve their church<br>
in the way they've been trained?<br>
<p>
A lot of SDAnetters cited numerous churches where women were ordained as<br>
ELDERS.  Well folks, ELDER does not equal PASTOR!  Yes, there are a few<br>
SDA female pastor but they ARE NOT ORDAINED MINISTERS.  These female pastors<br>
can do everything an ordained minister can EXCEPT receive fair compensation<br>
for doing that work.  That's all there is to it.  It don't care if every<br>
elder in America was a women.  Until the SDA church is composed of 50%<br>
female ORDAINED MINISTERS, the SDA church is still a "man's church."  Until<br>
the selfish men at the top relinquish their most cherished power to control<br>
the SDA church, it is a man's church.  When will the SDA church have their<br>
first female conference president?  How about even a local conference<br>
secretary or vice president?  Not until women can be ordained because only<br>
ORDAINED MINISTERS can be employed in that capacity.  How many male ministers<br>
support ordination of women?  How many would be willing to give up their<br>
jobs to even up the stats?  Should they have to give up their jobs?  No, but<br>
shouldn't the seminary accept a disproportionate number of women to start<br>
equalizing the numbers?  Shouldn't there be 2 females hired for every 1 male<br>
minister?  Would there be equal representation in 50 years?  The very weak<br>
objections to the ordination of women in SDA theology smacks sexism.  I<br>
fail to understand how a church that was started by a woman (EGW) and who<br>
recognized a female prophet for over 50 years, could with clear conscience<br>
continue with this obvious discrimination.  To the world, the SDA witness<br>
says that women are equal to men in theory but the men in the church don't<br>
love God and the women enough to make it a reality.<br>

[From Drew Corrigan]<br>
Woody writes:<br>
<i>&gt; Herb Armstrongs Worldwide Church of God, yes, Jehovah's witness no.</i><br>
<p>
As a member of the WCoG I would like to make a comment on this point.<br>
To the best of my knowledge, Mr Armstrong was never associated with the<br>
SDA church other than having read your literature at the time when he<br>
was being called to repentance and was researching the issue of the <br>
Sabbath and other doctrines (even as I and numerous other WCoG members<br>
have probably done).<br>
<p>
[Some SDA folklore I have heard indicates that Armstrong's wife was an SDA<br>
at one time.  Any truth to this?  SCT]<br>
<p>
In fact, Mr Armstrong was ordained a minister of the Oregon (sp?)<br>
Conference of the Church of God 7th Day. The Churches in the Conference<br>
were only loosely associated and essentially autonomous. When a leading<br>
personality (Mr Andrew Dugger) in the Conference decided to reform the<br>
governmental structure along other lines there was disagreement and<br>
the Conference effectively dissolved leaving local congregations to<br>
administer themselves as they saw fit. Mr Armstrong's congregation<br>
supported him in his evangelical campaigns and in time that church chose<br>
to incorporate under the name Radio Church of God and later Worldwide<br>
Church of God in order to distinguish itself from the myriad of other<br>
Churches of God.<br>
<p>
So far as the Church of God 7th Day goes, it is my understanding (having<br>
read histories written by ministers of the CoG7D) that it was not an<br>
"offshoot" of the SDA Church. As I recall the story, prior to the meeting<br>
at Battle Creek (1860s?) when the name "Seventh Day Adventist" was chosen<br>
by Mrs White, there was no generally agreed upon title, though many in<br>
the 7th day movement used the term "Church of God".  When the title<br>
"Seventh Day Adventist" was chosen, a schism occured, a smaller portion of<br>
the Church wishing to retain the title "Church of God", while the majority<br>
chose "Seventh Day Adventist" (on the basis that it was more distinctive).<br>
<p>
[I believe Adventist literature refers to this group as the "Messenger Party"<br>
They developed a separate identity in the mid-1850's before the name <br>
Seventh-day Adventist was chosen.  SCT]<br>
<p>
Those retaining the title "Church of God" eventually became the CoG7D.<br>
They also retained the idea of the millenium being on earth with Jesus<br>
ruling with the saints from the Jerusalem, and chose not to acknowledge <br>
Mrs White as a prophet among other things.<br>
<p>
Thus, we do not consider ourselves as an offshoot of the SDA Church <br>
though we claim a common history prior to the days of the schism.<br>
<p>
On another point, Eric Snyder wrote:<br>
<i>&gt;Neither our local congregation nor our</i><br>
<i>&gt;Denomination as a whole claim exclusive right to God.  If you were to</i><br>
<i>&gt;put me in a room with an LDS, a Jehovah's Witness, and someone from</i><br>
<i>&gt;Worldwide church of God, they would all have something in common.</i><br>
<i>&gt;They would each either publically or silently be completed convinced</i><br>
<i>&gt;in his/her mind that there particular group was "truly God's church"</i><br>
<i>&gt;and that the others were off base and in turn in heretical groups.</i><br>
<p>
Our current understanding and teaching is that the WCoG does *NOT* claim<br>
to have the "corner on the market" with regards to salvation. I will agree<br>
that at times in the past we have claimed to be be God's one true Church,<br>
though even here as I reread some of Mr Armstrong's writings there is a<br>
degree of ambiguity involved because we have never claimed that the CoG7D<br>
(for example) ceased to be a part of God's church as the WCoG took on a<br>
separate identity. At any rate, we now acknowledge that God is bigger than<br>
the WCoG and we do not hold to exclusivist views. To be fair, I would say<br>
however, that we believe we are holding more closely to the original form<br>
of worship and doctrine practised by the NT Church. (If we did not believe<br>
this, there would be no point in us existing as a distinct body of<br>
believers :-))<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I believe that God is bigger than my organization.</i><br>
<p>
Ditto.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We have no leader's that we must pay homage to.</i><br>
<p>
For the sake of a little humour (though it is quite serious in another<br>
sense) ... the WCoG does pay homage to its Leader. We regard him as a <br>
Prophet (Acts 3:22) and in fact he has been alive for the past 1960+ <br>
years ...<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Cheryl, I would be interested in knowning the status of women in the <br>
church of LDS. Is it a current issue ? <br>
<p>
Of the latter-day prophets in the LDS church, how many are or have been women ?<br>
<p>
What of the 12 apostles in the LDS church how many of those are women ?<br>
<p>
What about the membership of the 2 quorums of 70 ?<br>
<p>
what percentage of the ministers are women ?<br>
<p>
What percentage of the elders :) are women ?<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

Cheryl, could you briefly describe what role(s) women occupy in the<br>
CoJCoLDS? Can they be ordained as full-fledged ministers?<br>
<p>
For your information, the WCoG does not ordain women as elders. It does <br>
ordain them as deaconesses, but this carries no formal opportunities to<br>
teach or speak. The reason we do not ordain women is because we follow<br>
the NT example where (apparently) only men were ordained as elders. <br>
<p>
I would say that this is not an issue in the WCoG. No one in the WCoG<br>
chooses to be a minister (or deaconess or deacon). Though various ones<br>
are trained in ministerial responsibilities, it is really a matter of<br>
the established ministry perceiving a need somewhere and then (after<br>
prayer and fasting) choosing a man to be a minister or a deacon or a<br>
woman to be a deaconess, as the case may be, to fill that need. (Actually,<br>
we believe it is God who guides the choosing. He "sets us in the Body<br>
where it pleases him".) Race is not a factor in choosing someone for<br>
an office and virtually all racial groups are represented in the ministry.<br>
<p>
When men are ordained as ministers, their wives are regarded as 50% of that<br>
ministry. This was even reflected in the way they were paid at one point <br>
- 50% of salary cheque made out to husband, 50% of salary cheque made out <br>
to wife. (I'm not sure how salaries are handled now that electronic banking<br>
is the norm.)<br>
<p>
The above being said, please do not think that the WCoG "oppresses" women.<br>
Women enjoy the same rights and opportunities as men in the Church and<br>
there is no discrimination on the basis of sex. [Needless to say, being<br>
ordained to an office is not regarded by us as a "right" - it is a position<br>
chosen by God - no issue of "rights" is involved to our way of thinking.]<br>
I think our male/female ratio is probably pretty close to 50/50 - if<br>
anything, there are probably more men than women in the Church. If our <br>
numbers were a lot bigger (presently at an all-time high of near 100,000 <br>
baptised members), maybe this would be an issue - I honestly can't say.<br>
<p>
Drew.<br>

Hello there!<br>
<p>
I don't write often on SDA net - I mostly read.  But had to respond to<br>
the "Thinking Man's Church" thread.<br>
<p>
First, let me introduce myself.  I currently work at Andrews University,<br>
as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science.  This is my 5th year of<br>
teaching here, after 2 years of working on my MS CS degree.  My wife<br>
(Carol Hurley Turk) works at Andrews Academy, and we both enjoy Berrien<br>
Springs, Michigan, life quite well.  Other than, as one person put it,<br>
"having to climb an apple tree to get a sense of elevation", we wouldn't<br>
change much about the place.  We both like outdoor activities very much<br>
(hiking, backpacking, snow skiiing, rock climbing - in other locales!),<br>
have just celebrated our 8th anniversary, and are looking forward to<br>
many more years together!  We are both fairly active in our local<br>
church, Pioneer Memorial Church (PMC), though would like to be part of<br>
the process of making our SDA church a better place for ourselves and<br>
everyone else who is a part of it.<br>
<p>
Now, back to "thinking people".<br>
<p>
I guess what I'm wanting to say is that however we say it, "thinking<br>
women's church",  "thinking man's", "thinking person's".....  I don't<br>
think that the SDA Church has (at least in my recent memory) been a<br>
place that likes thinking people.  Thus, I'd propose that it isn't a<br>
thinking person's church no matter what word is used to describe the<br>
sexuality of the person of reference.  My main perception (maybe this is<br>
changing now) has been that if you THINK, and if you QUESTION the church<br>
leadership, whether this is at the local, conference, union, or GC<br>
level, then you are not accepted.  I'd like to think that this is<br>
changing, and that someday (soon) the SDA church WILL be a "thinking<br>
person's" church, but right now it is hard to see that coming when<br>
everywhere thinking, questioning, etc is so unaccepted.<br>
<p>
Let me know YOUR thoughts and experiences!  Have a good day!<br>
<p>

A Call for Healing<br>
<p>
Cheryl and Sue are absolutely right.  We continue to practice the<br>
patriarchalism of biblical times, claiming that we have biblical authority for<br>
the exclusion of women from full participation in the Adventist ministry.<br>
<p>
One problem with this kind of reasoning is that it is selective.  We do not<br>
practice everything that the Bible describes as practiced by the earliest<br>
Christians, e.g., common property holding and the kind treatment of our<br>
slaves.  On the flip side, we practice all kinds of things in the church that<br>
the Bible does not provide for, e.g., a professional clergy and a political<br>
infrastructure.  The point is, while church praxis may be generally based<br>
on certain biblical principles, it must be specifically designed to meet<br>
contemporary needs in the context of contemporary societal and domestic<br>
realities.  In this respect, the church of the New Testament period was no<br>
different from us.  Their particular organization and policies were<br>
conditioned by the expectations and realities of their time and place.  We<br>
must allow ours to be so conditioned as well.  For them, the holding of<br>
slaves and the subordination of women were realities in the context of<br>
which they lived their Christian lives and conducted the business of their<br>
church.  We should no more feel compelled to emulate their subordination<br>
of women than we should their holding of slaves.<br>
<p>
We have reached a strange position.  On the one hand, we have officially,<br>
if not always evidenced in local practice, given women the right to perform<br>
certain ecclesiastical duties.  For example, they may serve as ORDAINED<br>
local elders, in which role they may share in the officiation at communion<br>
services.  This is an office that is sanctioned by the New Testament,<br>
although we have no record in the text of any elder being ordained or any<br>
discussion of such a practice.  (Curiously, our admission of women to the<br>
office of elder would seem to exceed certain Pauline injunctions.)  On the<br>
other hand, we refuse to ordain women to the professional clergy, a calling<br>
not specifically identified in the New Testament.<br>
<p>
The bottom line is that we need to recognize that the praxis of the New<br>
Testament church is not normative for the praxis of the church at other<br>
times and places.  Just as the praxis of the former was conditioned by its<br>
historical context, so also ours must be permitted to develop in the context<br>
of our own time and expectations.  The timeless role of the Bible in this<br>
regard is to provide principles, such as love, service, commitment, and<br>
justice, that will shape the praxis of the church in any time or place, no<br>
matter what its specific characteristics may be.<br>
<p>
We must not allow this issue to remain like that strange miracle of Jesus<br>
which, upon his first attempt at healing, left the man incompletely cured of<br>
blindness.  Just as he completed the healing task, let us together, as women<br>
and men, quickly rectify this injustice by including women in the arena of<br>
full ecclesiastical rights--not only the rights of ordination to the<br>
professional clergy but also those of church leadership at the highest levels.<br>

Dave's comments are well taken.  I guess I better expound some more.  I lead<br>
a rather spirited SS class when I teach.  I try *VERY* hard to get the class<br>
to think for them selves.  I tend to be quite philospohical in outlook, and<br>
tend to explore deep subjects (the kind that if you think about them, raise<br>
more and more questions).  I find that I get much intellectual stimulus from<br>
SS, we have some very keen minds that ask really probing questions in our<br>
church.  One does not approach the understanding of Revalation, and Daniel<br>
with a quick glossing over. It takes some real digging, and understanding.<br>
It takes a lot of thinking to put it together.  That is one aspect of<br>
"thinking".  The other aspect of thinking is serious questing for truth, and<br>
understanding.  Again, you can't approach this on a superficial level.  Question<br>
and study for your self.  One should not necessarily take the word of someone<br>
else for something.  Understanding how people relate on one another, is another<br>
facet of the same thing.  Sometime, perhaps I'll get around to sharing with<br>
the net, some research that I did way back in undergrad days that convinced<br>
me to turn off the Television.  Several times in SS class we have gotten into<br>
that topic, and analyzed the where's and whyfore's of TV.  One of my SS<br>
students once said, "when Woody teaches the class, you might not get through<br>
the lesson, but you sure know all the implications and issues".<br>
HOWEVER, I try very hard not to get into doctrine to heavily.  It is a quick<br>
way to lose a new convert.  Doctrine is important, because it is the glue<br>
that really cements the church together, and makes it unique, but you HAVE<br>
to go easy.<br>
<p>
This all reminds me of a story I once heard.  A circuit riding preacher<br>
stopped at his scheduled church one sunday, and was quite dismayed to find<br>
only one old farmer sitting in the church.  Being a dedicated man of the cloth,<br>
the preacher plowed right into the service, and when time came to preach<br>
the sermon, he really got going. An hour and a half later he wound down.<br>
As he was shaking the farmers hand after the service, he asked the man<br>
how the service was.  the farmer said, "when I go to feed the cows, and<br>
only one is there, I feed him, but not the whole bale".  <br>
<p>
or something like that<br>
Cheers<br>
Woody<br>

Ruben asks Cheryl about women in the LDS top down leadership.<br>
<p>
I'd also like to see Cheryl respond to the same questions that Ruben<br>
asked, with regards to blacks.  And some history on the policy<br>
changes with regards to blacks and women.<br>

<i>&gt; female ORDAINED MINISTERS, the SDA church is still a "man's church."</i><br>
<p>
I have to disagree with this last statement.  To say that unless a church has a<br>
female minister, it is not fit for women consumption is taking it abit too far.,<br>
Women are welcome and should be welcome to call it their church regardless of<br>
the sex or race of the ministor/pastor.  What difference should it make?  I am<br>
talking about attendence here, not jobs.  Now as for jobs go, I don't see or<br>
hear of very many women actively going into the ministry.  Until you do, you<br>
won't achieve a 50% ratio that you seek/demand in a very long time.  True, many<br>
may be discourage to go into that profession due to the difficulties their<br>
predicessors encountered, but I still think that not very many women DESIRE to<br>
become ministers.  Some professions are just that way.  I don't see very many<br>
women construction workers or electrical engineers...they exist! but I don't see<br>
50% or even close to that.  When we have &gt;50% women graduating in theology at<br>
the seminary, then we have reason to make this a burning issue.  My point is, I<br>
don't see nearly as many women DESIRING to become ministers as I do men.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Until</i><br>
<i>&gt; the selfish men at the top relinquish their most cherished power to control</i><br>
<i>&gt; the SDA church, it is a man's church.  When will the SDA church have their</i><br>
<i>&gt; first female conference president?</i><br>
<p>
When will we have our first female president of the USA?  Why doesn't more women<br>
run for presidency?  Why do they not make it?  If women were so hot to get a<br>
female president of this country, then why can't they even get one on a major<br>
party ticket to run?  Why did a majority of women still vote for a male<br>
president with a male vp instead of a president with a female vp?<br>
<p>
I believe society as a whole (including women) still prefer a man to hold the<br>
position of leadership of this country.  Why would it be expected to be<br>
different in a subset of this culture called the SDA church?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How about even a local conference</i><br>
<i>&gt; secretary or vice president?  Not until women can be ordained because only</i><br>
<i>&gt; ORDAINED MINISTERS can be employed in that capacity.  How many male ministers</i><br>
<i>&gt; support ordination of women?  How many would be willing to give up their</i><br>
<i>&gt; jobs to even up the stats?  Should they have to give up their jobs?  No, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; shouldn't the seminary accept a disproportionate number of women to start</i><br>
<i>&gt; equalizing the numbers?  Shouldn't there be 2 females hired for every 1 male</i><br>
<i>&gt; minister?  Would there be equal representation in 50 years?  The very weak</i><br>
<i>&gt; objections to the ordination of women in SDA theology smacks sexism.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; fail to understand how a church that was started by a woman (EGW) and who</i><br>
<i>&gt; recognized a female prophet for over 50 years, could with clear conscience</i><br>
<i>&gt; continue with this obvious discrimination.  To the world, the SDA witness</i><br>
<i>&gt; says that women are equal to men in theory but the men in the church don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; love God and the women enough to make it a reality.</i><br>
<p>
This is not a matter of love IMHO.  I am not against granting the women that<br>
want to be ministers the ordination they seek provided they meet the<br>
qualifications that a man has to meet up to for the same.  I agree that there is<br>
some discrimination in the upper ranks of the leadership.  I wish it were not<br>
so.  Women are as capable or even more so in some things compared with men but<br>
this is not true for all areas.  I believe the Bible supports the idea of men in<br>
leadership roles.<br>
<p>
But you speak as if there is a large number of women clammering to get it but<br>
being denied this access.  I can believe there are some but not large numbers.<br>
 If you can substantiate these claims with even a statement that you know or<br>
have heard of x number of women that have been denied, I'd like to know about<br>
it.  I don't think the seminary denies a disproportionate number of women to<br>
men.  I am not saying that it doesn't happen...i just would be surprised.<br>
<p>
I really think that society as a whole still feels more comfortable with male<br>
leadership than female.  This goes back to Biblical days.  How many women<br>
prophets were there compared to men prophets?  How about disciples?  How about<br>
most of the stories of patriarchs and other heroric leaders.  Most were men.<br>
 Does this make it right or wrong...I don't know but I can say that when society<br>
as a whole desires to have more women in roles they before haven't been in<br>
before, then so be it.  But please stop flaming the SDA church because it<br>
doesn't fall in line with your goals or desires.  We are part of a society that<br>
traditionally likes men in leadership roles.  That's da facts, mam! (IMHO)<br>
<p>
By the way, how does the LDS church stack up to equivalent questions?<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
We have heard much already on the issue of women's ordination.  I get the <br>
impression that most of the contributors to this discussion accept as an <br>
established fact that the Pauline passages such as "I do not allow a woman<br>
to teach" and "An elder must be the husband of one wife" do not apply (at <br>
least in this form) today.  Is this the consensus?  <br>
<p>
I am not convinced that we are being truthful in our hermeneutics.  What <br>
principle is Paul establishing in such passages?  I feel the Net is bypassing<br>
an important aspect of this topic.  Here are some questions we need to answer:<br>
<p>
     1.  Does scripture have anything to say to this the issue of women's <br>
         ordination, given that North American society offers women increasing<br>
         rights and privileges as compared with the Middle East centuries ago?<br>
<p>
     2.  If it does (as I believe) have something to say regarding this issue,<br>
         what is it?  (This really gets at a larger issue -- namely that of<br>
         the relative importance of considering the culture of the times when<br>
         extracting biblical principles and applying them today.)<br>
<p>
Must the discussion descend into numerous accusations of men being unloving and <br>
unChristlike because they refuse to give women their "rights?"  It is not at<br>
all clear to me that this is merely an issue of justice.  We need more<br>
thorough scriptural discussion on this issue.<br>

It's interesting to me how a comment on another subject (thinking in the<br>
church) which was careless in its gender-inclusiveness (thinking<br>
_man's_ church) started a discussion on the role of women in the church.<br>
It is well for all of us to be gender inclusive in our language, not<br>
because it's PC, but because it's right.  I do not believe the orginal<br>
remark, however, was meant to be deliberately offensive.  However, along<br>
with Cheryl, I also was offended by the remarks quoted in her posting of<br>
15 Feb.  I also do not believe women who are "called" (whatever that is)<br>
should have to go outside the church to minister.  As to pay, that<br>
raises other interesting issues.  I've seen surveys that show that SDA<br>
pastors are paid at or above the average of other clergy (nor sure<br>
whether that includes Catholic priests or not, but certainly would<br>
include the fundamentalist type).  At any rate, pay rates would<br>
certainly vary from denomination to denomination, and even church to<br>
church (my local Lutheran friends think the Adventist system is better<br>
than their own on the latter point).  However, the determination of SDA<br>
clergy (at least some of them) to make sure that their pay is higher<br>
than any other denominational worker (other than medical, and there are<br>
some who wonder if they are really denominational workers at all!) is<br>
oppressive.  It certainly makes it difficult to hire professionals in<br>
many areas, including lawyers, college faculty, accountants, etc.  But<br>
that's a different topic.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, I would have to agree with Cheryl that women pastors are<br>
being actively and oppressively denied pastoral jobs in many<br>
(fortunately not all) locations.  I only have to look out my office<br>
window to see one such church--Pioneer Memorial Church, which should be<br>
an example to the world church.  We have had women elders (only after a<br>
huge fuss) for about 5 years now, but no sign that we will get any<br>
female pastors, even though this desire has been plainly made to the<br>
pastoral staff.  Unfortunately, the pastoral staff and the conference<br>
staff are, I believe, doing exactly what Cheryl charges them with.<br>
There has already been enough time for something to do done, and at<br>
least some members of that congregation (myself included) are angry that<br>
nothing has been done.  This is the example that the seminary students<br>
see.<br>
<p>
I agree that elders are not pastors (although an important step in the<br>
right direction).  I'm not sure at present, exactly what the differences<br>
are, in practical terms, between ordained and unordained ministers<br>
(other than the need to be ordained to be in certain positions).  Does<br>
someone else on the net know what differences there are in pay and<br>
pastoral duties?  It seems that baptizing has been seen as for ordained<br>
only, although in some places female pastors have baptized.  Regardless<br>
of the practical sameness or differentness, even if it is totally<br>
symbolic (which it isn't), symbolism is still important.  It is for this<br>
reason that I believe some ordained ministers have threatened to give up<br>
their ordination until women are ordained.<br>
<p>
However, I disagree with Cheryl about the desirability to set a quota<br>
for female pastors.  For one thing, this assumes that as many women as<br>
men _want_ to become pastors.  At present, this does not appear to be<br>
the case, though of course there could be many reasons for this (there<br>
are many disincentives, to be sure).  I am in favor of much greater<br>
support for and encouragement of women to make this choice (this will be<br>
hard until women can be ordained).  I don't believe in quotas in any<br>
case.  For example, just because the library field is between 70 and 80<br>
percent female, I don't accept it as a "female profession."  I don't<br>
demand that libraries hire 50% men (although I think society has tended<br>
not to value librarians, with adequate compensation among other things,<br>
because of the common misperception).  There are also interesting<br>
gender differences between academic and public libraries (with public<br>
libraries much more female [and lower pay], and academic libraries with<br>
more male librarians [though closer to half]).  Academic library pay is<br>
closely related to campus pay, and thus higher.  I have noticed in the<br>
professional literature, however, that public libraries have been<br>
encouraged to make sure that their collections appeal to men as well as<br>
to women (i.e. more non fiction).  Enough on that.<br>
<p>
Again, I can't speak for the seminary (though I can see it also out my<br>
window!), I think I should say a few things about it (Nancy Vymeister<br>
can correct me if I'm wrong).  First, the seminary practices open<br>
admission (or virtually so), except for the doctoral programs.  In fact,<br>
this outsider would say they virtually take any warm body that shows up,<br>
and has money to pay the fees (which are much more heavily<br>
church-subsidized than other campus programs).  I should think the<br>
seminary would accept many more women, but they've got to apply.  I do<br>
not believe that an institution, like Andrews University, that accepts<br>
government aid to students can adopt a deliberately discriminatory<br>
admission policy that is suggested (and I really don't think a dedicated<br>
feminist really wants to open up that bottle).  It should also be<br>
pointed out that admission to the seminary has little or no relationship<br>
to (and is certainly no guarantee for) landing a job with a conference.<br>
Lack of admission standards has been a sore point with the seminary<br>
faculty for years, and we have accepted many academically poor students<br>
over the years.  Many students don't really want to be here, and don't<br>
really want to learn anything.  Really, it's rather pathetic.  Those who<br>
want to become ministers are either self-selected or God-selected,<br>
depending on how you react to the idea of receiving "a call."  We've<br>
seen some pretty nutty people (not to mention some that aren't very<br>
intelligent) feel very strongly "called."  Perhaps we need to encourage<br>
more women to feel "called."  <br>
<p>
However, there is certainly one thing that the Seminary should be doing,<br>
and there's some evidence that they're beginning to see the need for<br>
this:  stopping the harrassment of female seminary students by male<br>
ones.  This topic was recently raised in the student newspaper here, and<br>
conversations with female seminary students over the years convince me<br>
that it is a real problem.  Sometimes it appears to me that seminary<br>
students are among the most out of touch with the times.  There are<br>
still many who consider the ministry to be a male club, and who resent<br>
any "intrusion" by women, and this includes female seminary students.  I<br>
don't know all the harrassment techniques used, but these types find<br>
many ways to make the female students feel unwelcome.  I don't have any<br>
direct evidence that faculty are part of the problem, but at the least<br>
those who allow this kind of behavior are as much a part of the problem<br>
as those (if there are any) who engage in such behavior themselves.<br>
<p>
Well, I do believe I've written enough today to get myself in trouble,<br>
so will quit.<br>

We are getting to the place where this issue is generating more heat<br>
than light.  The questions about women in the LDS church begged to be<br>
asked, <br>
but I am not sure I want to see them answered here.  SDAnet has no business<br>
discussing the problems of another denomination when we can't solve our own.<br>
<p>
The question of ordination in general and women's ordination in specific<br>
is a burning theological issue which for the most part is hidden by politics.<br>
Most of the hardship being inflicted on women in the church currently has <br>
not to do with the lack of ordination, but what the political consequences<br>
of ordination are in today's church.<br>
<p>
Immediately if not sooner, we should:<br>
1) Remove the pay differential between ordained and non-ordained ministers<br>
2) Remove ordination or lack thereof as a qualification for career<br>
advancement and continued employment<br>
3) Return to the initial SDA policy of not requiring conference officers<br>
to be ordained ministers<br>
4) Enforce the existing guidelines on sexual harassment in SDA schools <br>
and workplaces<br>
5) Create opportunities within the SDA ministry that will not force women to <br>
choose between their families and their career.  (#'s 4 and 5 also apply<br>
to the teaching profession.)<br>
<p>
You will find that those who oppose the ordination of women will most likely<br>
oppose all five of the above measures as well, even though they have nothing<br>
to do with the spiritual functions of a minister.  It's an unfortunate<br>
fact that the biggest blow struck for women's rights in the SDA church<br>
was a <br>
lawsuit, the Merikay Silver case (after which my mother's salary nearly<br>
doubled).  Will legal action be required again? I would hope not but it <br>
is probably already being considered by some. <br>
<p>
When ordination is stripped of the political plums that accompany it, <br>
then it will be easier to focus on the spiritual issues.  Such as:<br>
<p>
1) Is ordination a sacrament bestowed by the church or a recognition of <br>
an existing call by the Holy Spirit?<br>
<p>
2) What are the larger implications of Bible interpretation that <br>
construes 2 Tim 2:11,12 to allow the ordination of women?<br>
<p>
Too often we tend to cast the whole debates in terms of rights, namely<br>
that women demand the right to be ordained to the gospel ministry<br>
and men claim the right to exclude them.  If the men of the church had cared<br>
more about preserving the rights of women through the years, women would not<br>
now be in a situation where they have to speak up for themselves.  <br>
<p>
If we could return to a consensus model of church governance, where<br>
everyone is concerned with preserving the rights of others rather than<br>
demanding their own, the problems would still exist, but the noise level<br>
would be a lot lower.  It seems to me that proof by CAPS LOCK is not the<br>
way to build consensus.  If we want to argue about womens issues we can<br>
each go to <br>
our local churches and do that.  SDAnet is not for rehashing old arguments,<br>
but for sharing viewpoints and building consensus.<br>

<i>&gt; But you speak as if there is a large number of women clammering to get it but</i><br>
<i>&gt; being denied this access.  I can believe there are some but not large numbers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  If you can substantiate these claims with even a statement that you know or</i><br>
<i>&gt; have heard of x number of women that have been denied, I'd like to know about</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  I don't think the seminary denies a disproportionate number of women to</i><br>
<i>&gt; men.  I am not saying that it doesn't happen...i just would be surprised.</i><br>
<p>
Just a personal experience.  I attend Andrews University.  During my<br>
Youth Ministry class last quarter, I visited the seminary a few times<br>
for research material and advice.  I consulted with two professors,<br>
and BOTH, in the process of the conversation brought it around to ask<br>
if I had any interest in going toward pastoral ministry.  Both were<br>
very encouraging on the issue, and tried their best to convince me.<br>
When I brought up the idea that women are not well accepted in that<br>
field, they stressed the fact that the church can't get used to it<br>
if women aren't out there to break tradition.  Now I still plan to<br>
go into teaching, not preaching, but I don't believe that the seminary<br>
professors are out to keep women out of the ministry.  The message<br>
I got from the ones I talked to was - we're in the last days.<br>
If the Lord is calling you into ministry, follow the calling and<br>
we'll do all we can to support that.  <br>

Hi,<br>
Any Mexicans?<br>
<p>
This is what I heard from my uncle that.<br>
<p>
Mexicans are mostly catholic, I think, and they cherish the pop<br>
[that's _pope_ for us non-creative spellers-------------------^SCT]<br>
so much and the great controversy (GC) have a lot of comments<br>
about pops (mostly bad ones :-( JK ).  And Mexicans doesn't like<br>
the book so the Mexicans forced to publish it after taking out<br>
 some nasty comments about pops.  That's what I heard. <br>
My sister is nagging me very bad to post this  :-) , because she's<br>
so curious about this.  And my uncle really wants to know <br>
whether this is a true story or not.<br>

I have heard many statements lately about the church being not a nice<br>
place until 50% of ministers are women.  Well, the church's job is to bring<br>
the message of Christ to the world.  In this we need the best people to<br>
do the job.  In this search for excellence, we pick whomever it may be<br>
that is best suited for the job to fill at hand.  If we are now being<br>
required to fill a quota, we are now being restricted on this search for<br>
excellence.  <br>
<p>
One of the lessons that we need to learn in this world is that it doesn't<br>
always _seem_ fair.   Fact is, there are times when it isn't fair.  And<br>
that creeps into the churh, surprizingly enough.  But that doesn't mean<br>
that we get to take our toys and go home.  This is stil the greatest<br>
church on earth.  Not because of who we are, or what we have, but because<br>
of who we know!<br>
<p>
One of the problems in this battle is you have the &lt;liberals&gt;, and <br>
&lt;conservatives&gt;, each on one side of a table, and neither wants to <br>
"lose".  Because when one special interest's agenda gets approved, another's<br>
gets disapproved.  Thus someone has to "lose".  We are just too proud<br>
and selfish to buckle down, study the _entire_ issue, speak frankly about<br>
why we feel/think the way we do, and move forward.  We are caught up<br>
in the political process.  We can't make a move that would alienate this<br>
group because we need their votes at the next constituency meeting.  We<br>
have to move cautiously to prevent that group from being offended.   I<br>
say let's get on with the process of discovering all of the issues and get<br>
on with the job at hand.  Which you'd all agree is delivering the message<br>
to the world.<br>
<p>
thanks for your attention<br>

Just in order to avoid being misunderstood (too late, I fear), let me explain<br>
what I was referring to in my reference to "women on women".<br>
<p>
A certain proportion of my lady friends say that although they have no<br>
objection to lady pastors as a concept, they simply prefer to hear a<br>
man's voice, as they generally find men's speech easier to understand,<br>
and often more pleasant. They hasten to add that they are not only<br>
referring to church, they also prefer male radio announcers and<br>
public speakers in general.<br>
<p>
As a strong supporter of women's ordination and other "women's issues", <br>
this frustrates me a little, as I feel that even if men are generally<br>
easier to understand (and this is not really the case), why let such<br>
a minor issue stand in the way of an important one?<br>
<p>
I am not of the opinion that everything is just fine regarding the<br>
equality of men and women, be it in the church or in the general<br>
community. I only have to look up and down the corridors of my<br>
own physics department to know that there is much to be done.<br>
<p>
At the same time, I know there are many in our church who are concerned<br>
about the issue, and who are trying their hardest to do something about<br>
it. Hence I don't like seeing the entire SDA church being accused wholesale<br>
of ignoring women and so on. <br>

Is it fair to say that the WASP representation at the GC session effectively<br>
voted *for* women's ordination, while the Hispanic and Black representation<br>
didn't? I heard that the vote would have been "yes" if it were not for strong<br>
opposition from the non-WASP cultures.<br>
<p>
If so, it is another good argument for a more congregational approach to<br>
things, rather than insisting that an SDA church is an SDA church no matter<br>
where you are or who you're with.<br>

Steve,<br>
Could I get you to briefly fill me in on a couple of things:<br>
	a) what is Libertarianism all about?<br>
[Libertarianism is a minor party in the USA and elsewhere which favors<br>
minimal government intrusion in people's lives.  Religious liberty is <br>
promoted, but so is legalization of drugs, pornography, etc.  Also <br>
the Libertarians favor major cutting of government spending.  In the <br>
last US election they got between 2 and 3 percent of the vote in some races.]<br>
<p>
	b) what kind of arguments were used to keep black etc people<br>
	out of Church office etc?<br>
[Many of the same ones as are currently being used against women.<br>
"They prefer to let whites manage their affairs.  They're not capable<br>
of managing themselves.  Some church members aren't ready for this to happen.<br>
They're inferior in capacity, etc, etc, etc......"  SCT]<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanx<br>
	Raylene<br>

Cheryl asks:<br>
----&gt;<br>
First, what is the IJ?<br>
What occurs during IJ?<br>
What is reviewed during IJ?<br>
Who is reviewed?<br>
Why are they reviewed?<br>
What decision is made during IJ?<br>
<p>
Then, explain to me (as you understand it) how works fit into this (if it does)?<br>
The obvious dilemma:  if we are saved by grace through faith and works are<br>
irrelevant, why is there an investigative judgement?  If works matter in the<br>
sense of reflecting our commitment and relationship to Christ, what is the<br>
purpose of the IJ?  If works matter a great deal and have impact on whether<br>
we are saved (by your own theology), is the IJ important and why?<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
DaveB also said:<br>
----&gt;<br>
I have always thought of the SDA church as being the church for people<br>
who eagerly want to search out the church that comes the closest<br>
possible to teaching what the Bible teaches.  EGW certainly points us<br>
in that direction.  A people who are eager to follow the word of God<br>
regardless of the cost, to obey God rather than man, to do His<br>
commandments because we love Him.<br>
<p>
Perhaps, when Woody said "thinking man's church" he meant those who<br>
want to be serious students of the Bible and obedient to what they<br>
find rather than a church for intelectual theologians.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
<p>
One gentleman who may have some interesting comments to make on both<br>
of these issues is one Desmond Ford. He too thought of the SDA church<br>
as being the church for people who eagerly want to search for Biblical<br>
truth, for serious students of the Bible and for those who wish to<br>
be obedient to what they find. He too tried to come to terms with<br>
the obvious dilemma concerning the investigative judgment. Everyone<br>
agrees he went wrong somewhere.<br>
<p>
Given the history of this issue, I consider it extremely unlikely<br>
that there will be more than one stock-standard answer to these<br>
questions appearing in writing. Perhaps we can save some bandwidth<br>
(I'm always one for saving bandwidth :-&gt; ) by referring Cheryl<br>
to the relevant chapters of the Great Controversy, original edition,<br>
which together with the Bible (KJV of course) will provide<br>
excellent answers to them all.<br>

I would like to reecho Tim's comments about the need to look at the<br>
scriptures as we deal with this issue.  I once did a paper on certain<br>
texts dealing with women in Luke and Paul.  At the time I thought that a<br>
lot of what Paul was saying was culturally based.  Now I am having my<br>
doubts.  Paul at times appears to make arguments based on events occuring<br>
in the Garden of Eden.  This tends to ground things more in theology<br>
rather than advice as to what is best for the current culture.  Also, I<br>
have been thinking about letting my best friends wife in on this<br>
conversation as she has been dealing with this issue. <br>

I stumbled over this thought-provoking passage:<br>
<p>
"Those who embrace the remnant concept today will live in two spheres:<br>
within the institutionalized church with all its complacency, culture<br>
of silence...in all its complicity with the ongoingness of evil; and<br>
in the world of the downtrodden, the abused, the pariahs. There they<br>
will denounce the dehumanization of the poor and the oppressed, and <br>
announce that all are called into full personhood.<br>
<p>
"These acts of annunication and denunciation must not be empty words,<br>
but strong and valid historical commitments. To denounce will involve<br>
speaking and acting...this (remnant) must not only speak for those<br>
who cannot speak themselves. They must also commit themselves to<br>
listen, really to hear the "voice of the voiceless" on THEIR own<br>
terms. We must struggle to make the church the place where the only<br>
credential to gain a hearing is a cry of agony, and not power, or savoir<br>
faire, or position, or items with which to bargain...<br>
<p>
"...it will not be an easy or comfortable task, because those tormenting<br>
and disquieting cries of affliction will indict us as well as those<br>
beyond us...Love forces us to act on behalf of those in need and to<br>
find ways to empower the weak so they can act on their own behalf.<br>
<p>
"If we are on the wrong side, then we must change sides. This is difficult<br>
and costly, for it means seeing things from a new perspective. Soon we<br>
discover that human concerns...which we simply condone we really sponsor...<br>
To know God is to work for justice."<br>
<p>

Abingdon Press, 1992, p. 70-71)<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<p>
I just have a very short question for us to consider. I would like some<br>
answers regarding this question.<br>
<p>
Why is it that neither Jesus nor the disciples never addressed the current <br>
social issues of their day (eg slavery, infringement of human rights etc). These<br>
issues were not petty or irrelevant yet Jesus never addressed them. Instead<br>
of addressing them (Jesus could have effectively addressed various of these)<br>
He taught the people to live with them, and even consider them hidden blessings.<br>
<p>
<p>
Why ?<br>
<p>
<p>
If He didn't and He is our example then to what extent should we ?<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

The SDA doctrine of the investigative judgment derives from three basic<br>
Biblical principles:  the prophesied cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel <br>
8:14, the description of Christ as the high priest in Hebrews, and <br>
the descriptions of the days of atonement in Leviticus, considering<br>
the investigative judgment to be the antitype of the Biblical Yom Kippur.<br>
The focus of this day in biblical times, as it should be now, was on <br>
repentance and confession of sins, and the cleansing of personal and<br>
corporate guilt from the congregation.  The tabernacle was cleansed once <br>
a year by the high priest going into the Most Holy Place and making<br>
confessions for all the sins of Israel.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;First, what is the IJ?</i><br>
The process of selecting and cleansing a people that will reflect the<br>
character of God.<br>
<i>&gt;What occurs during IJ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;What is reviewed during IJ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Who is reviewed?</i><br>
All of "spiritual Israel", those who claim or have claimed Christ as Savior.<br>
<i>&gt;Why are they reviewed?</i><br>
To see if they have claimed Christ's forgiveness for their sins.<br>
<i>&gt;What decision is made during IJ?</i><br>
Those who have overcome are not blotted out of the book of life, the others<br>
presumably are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then, explain to me (as you understand it) how works fit into this (if</i><br>
it &gt;does)?<br>
<i>&gt;The obvious dilemma:  if we are saved by grace through faith and works are</i><br>
<i>&gt;irrelevant, why is there an investigative judgement?  If works matter in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense of reflecting our commitment and relationship to Christ, what is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;purpose of the IJ?  If works matter a great deal and have impact on whether</i><br>
<i>&gt;we are saved (by your own theology), is the IJ important and why?</i><br>
<p>
If we were saved by grace through faith and works were irrelevant, God <br>
could take us all to heaven the moment we were saved.  "Good works" come<br>
as a natural result of the power of God's forgiveness changing our lives.<br>
Too often we lose sight of the redemptive nature of forgiveness, focusing <br>
only on the bookkeeping aspects of it.  The goal of the Day of Atonement<br>
is to prepare a people for the final days that is free of sin.  For this<br>
God must apply judgement to see who are those who have allowed His<br>
forgiveness to work.<br>

Tony suggested that the womens issues are another reason towards having <br>
more local governance of churches.  Let me inform those of you who<br>
haven't heard yet:  <br>
<p>
Congregational Adventism is here!  **<br>
<p>
<p>
(** Not valid in Michigan and where otherwise prohibited)<br>
<p>
The policies of this church are still uniformly set, but not uniformly <br>
enforced anymore.  Pastors and boards have much opportunity to find<br>
latitude within the "guidelines."  We are entering the post-institutional<br>
stage of Adventism, when the only SDA institution a member will contact<br>
during his or her lifetime is his/her local congregation.  For 50-75%<br>
of our youth this is already the case.<br>
<p>
Congregational Adventism is not a boon to everyone, though.  At the last<br>
yuppie listening session in the Pennsylvania Conference, I realized that<br>
although Jerry Page, president of that conference, is a Baby Boomer himself,<br>
as was the recent secretary of that conference, and our local pastor in <br>
Pittsburgh is also a boomer, this has not translated into the change young <br>
people would like to see in the churches of Pennsylvania.  Congregations<br>
are more likely to impede progress than to rush ahead on their own.<br>
These same people would, however, most likely follow along with reform<br>
were orders to come from the top.<br>

[From Cheryl Berthelsen  cherylb@csd4.csd.uwm.edu]<br>
I was very hesitant to post about this subject because the moderator has<br>
told me that many on the net complain whenever nonSDA stuff appears.  But<br>
since many of you asked, I assume I have license to answer.<br>
<p>
[I'd like to thank Cheryl for submitting a nonconfrontational response<br>
to an almost-rhetorical question.  Those who asked the question obviously<br>
have some different information, otherwise they wouldn't have asked it.<br>
It's common knowledge that some women in the LDS church have not been<br>
quite as happy of campers as Cheryl appears to be  (i.e. Sonia Johnson).<br>
We could dispute that fact all day, I hope we won't.  I hope this marks<br>
the end of this thread.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<p>
The status of women in the LDS Church is not an issue among LDS members.<br>
This is primarily because, unlike the SDA Church, the LDS Church has a<br>
theological basis for having a male-dominated church government.  However,<br>
the LDS Church has a well-established women's program called "The Relief<br>
Society" which places women in leadership positions.  There is also "The<br>
Young Womens Society" for the teens.  These were set up in the very beginning<br>
of the development of the church and offer opportunity for service, leadership<br>
and address women's issues.  The LDS Church has never ignored its women,<br>
ministering to their needs, speaking to their needs regularly and consistently.<br>
<p>
The LDS Church does not have paid clergy so all the Bishops and Elders<br>
have regular jobs and perform their duties for the ward they are assigned<br>
to on a VOLUNTEER basis.  How many SDA minister would minister to the church<br>
members without pay while maintaining a fulltime job to support their own<br>
families?  So as you can see, being an LDS Bishop requires great commitment<br>
and fortitude and does not carry ANY financial reward whatsoever.  It is the<br>
eternal reward that satisfies.  LDS missionaries are not paid during the<br>
two years they service the church.  In fact, their own families pay their<br>
son or daughter's expenses.  The church, a few years back, recognized that<br>
missions in some areas of the world were cheaper than others so the leaders<br>
standardized the amount that is paid to support each missionary.  Each<br>
family pays at the present time $425 per month.  If the missionary does not<br>
have a family willing to pay, the local ward where he/she is a member pays<br>
it.<br>
<p>
The most obvious difference between women in the SDA church and women in the<br>
LDS church is this:  LDS churches do not have professional paid ministers.<br>
Not even those who speak in Sunday services are professional or paid.  Rather,<br>
all local members are asked at some time during the year to present a talk<br>
(sermon if you will) for sacrament meeting.  I gave a talk just 3 weeks ago on<br>
the subject of gratitude.  Our topics are usually assigned within the framework<br>
of a general theme and there are usually 2-3 speakers each Sunday. <br>
Every member<br>
over 12 years old (male and female) is expected to contribute to the<br>
spirituality of the ward in this way.  It is quite unique, I believe, because<br>
we hear talks from new converts, from seasoned life-time members, and from the<br>
teens.  We occasionally have a special talk from someone for the stake high<br>
council but these are not professional clergy either.<br>
<p>
Women are revered and respected in the LDS Church for their spiritual duty<br>
to their homes and families.  The LDS Church still emphasizes that if a<br>
woman has children at home, she should not work outside the home.  The<br>
church supports many single parents (divorcees with kids) rather than have<br>
them resort to government welfare.<br>
<p>
The church visitation program in the form of home and visiting teachers<br>
provides leadership and service for all men and women.  Each member or family<br>
in the ward has a home teacher (man) who visits them in their home once a month<br>
to deliver a spiritual message and see if they have any needs.  Each woman in<br>
the ward has a visiting teacher (woman) who visits once a month to specifically<br>
minister to the woman's needs, both spiritual and physical.  I have a visiting<br>
teacher (a woman) and a home teacher (an elder) and I visit teach 2 other women<br>
in the ward each month.  Thus, the LDS church has a formal program to address<br>
our needs and allow us to minister one another.  If I am ill, I can call my<br>
home teacher to come over and pray and annoint me.  If I have a physical need,<br>
I can call my visiting teacher and she will bring food, money, or whatever.  If<br>
I am discouraged, I can call either one, day or night.  Obviously, if each<br>
home or visiting teacher is responsible for 1 or 2 families, to minister to<br>
any of their needs, there is no need for paid clergy to do this.  And we each<br>
in our own duties are ministering to other.<br>
<p>
So, as you can see, there is not any gross disparity or "discrimination" in<br>
the LDS system.  The role of "minister" in the LDS church is more of an<br>
administrator behind the scenes.  In the year and a half I've been a member,<br>
I have never heard a Bishop give a talk on Sunday.  And I've not heard a<br>
single women feel that they are being treated unfairly or being slighted in<br>
any way.<br>
<p>
Thanks for allowing me to share this on SDAnet.<br>
<p>
Cheryl<br>

[From Sue Harrington  sue@cuc.edu, edited by me to make the lines the <br>
right length and make more clear who is talking.  Indented remarks<br>
are by Bruce Holm.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have to disagree with this last statement.  To say that unless a</i><br>
church &gt;has a<br>
<i>&gt;female minister, it is not fit for women consumption is taking it abit</i><br>
too &gt;far.,<br>
<p>
Why is that?  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Women are welcome and should be welcome to call it their church regardless &gt;of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the sex or race of the ministor/pastor.  What difference should it make?</i><br>
<p>
Why would we want to call it our church when we are denied access.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am talking about attendence here, not jobs.  Now as for jobs go, I</i><br>
don't &gt;see or hear of very many women actively going into the ministry. <br>
<p>
Why would you study computer science if you were denied a computer on<br>
which to practice what you had studied?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I still think that not very many women DESIRE to become ministers.  </i><br>
<p>
Why would any thinking woman want to be a minister in this church.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't see nearly as many women DESIRING to become ministers as I do men.</i><br>
<p>
Is that supposed to be an insight?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;When will we have our first female president of the USA?</i><br>
<p>
Good question!!!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why did a majority of women still vote for a male president with a male</i><br>
vp &gt;instead of a president with a female vp?<br>
<p>
Is this a serious question?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I believe society as a whole (including women) still prefer a man to hold &gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;	position of leadership of this country.  Why would it be expected to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;	different in a subset of this culture called the SDA church?</i><br>
<p>
My, are we threatened or what?  Could we more accurately say that those<br>
in power prefer to remain in power?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I believe the Bible supports the idea of men in leadership roles.</i><br>
<p>
Is this an "appeal to authority"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't think the seminary denies a disproportionate number of women to</i><br>
<i>&gt;men. </i><br>
<p>
You might find useful information on this topic by talking to women who<br>
have studied at the seminary.  What kind of a learning experience was it<br>
for them <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But please stop flaming the SDA church because it doesn't fall in line</i><br>
with &gt;your goals or desires. <br>
<p>
Are you saying that when we question erroneous practices of the church<br>
we are flaming the church.  For a good example of this practice you<br>
could check out the Holy One who came to this earth.  Jesus had nothing<br>
positive to say about the church of his day.  I choose to take my<br>
example from the only example we have of divinity and to keep<br>
questioning, critiquing, and even harrassing our church until all people<br>
in this church are treated with respect.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;By the way, how does the LDS church stack up to equivalent questions?</i><br>
<p>
Is this meant as a slam for Cheryl?  <br>
<p>
Personally, I find the egocentrism in some of the postings attempting to<br>
justify the current situation revolting.  At least you inspire me to<br>
keep working toward a more equitable church.<br>

<i>&gt;Steve, what is the status of the board? You have not announced it</i><br>
<i>&gt;as yet to the net, have you?  Pam </i><br>
<p>
Without further ado, I present your SDAnet board  (it has been set for <br>
a week already, I just forgot to post it.<br>
<p>
Dan Bidwell, Andrews University<br>
Scott Bechtel, Union College<br>
Woody Baker, Austin, TX<br>
Harvey Brenneise, Andrews University<br>
Pam Harris, Southern College /University of Tennessee<br>
John Fegan, Marquette, MI<br>
Ademir Soares, NASA<br>
<p>
<p>
If you have a complaint against the moderator, you can now send it <br>
to +dist+/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr4/st0o/sdaboard.dl@andrew.cmu.edu<br>
and all the board members will get it, plus a copy to me.  Depending <br>
on what the board decides to do they may or may not take me to task,<br>
and I may or may not listen to them.<br>
<p>
The relationship of the board to the moderator of SDAnet still needs <br>
to be worked out in detail.  But I'm glad these people have agreed to serve.<br>
They represent a diverse group of talents and resources.  I have charged<br>
them with selecting their own chair.<br>

<i>&gt; I just have a very short question for us to consider. I would like</i><br>
<i>&gt; some answers regarding this question.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why is it that neither Jesus nor the disciples never addressed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; current social issues of their day (eg slavery, infringement of human</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights etc). These issues were not petty or irrelevant yet Jesus never</i><br>
<i>&gt; addressed them. Instead of addressing them (Jesus could have</i><br>
<i>&gt; effectively addressed various of these) He taught the people to live</i><br>
<i>&gt; with them, and even consider them hidden blessings.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If He didn't and He is our example then to what extent should we ?</i><br>
<p>
Well, human nature has probably not changed since Jesus's time, and<br>
it's also highly likely that there were social issues in abundance<br>
back then.  Perhaps one way of answering this question is to look at<br>
ourselves and see how we react.<br>
<p>
This newsgroup is one example of reactions -- more heat than light on<br>
issues such as the ordinatin of women, abortion, last fall's<br>
presidential election, and so on.<br>
<p>
Another example is the tendency to take sides and denigrate people on<br>
the other side -- I see this in myself in the social issues I've<br>
followed over the years.<br>
<p>
I used to think when I was younger that people could be logically<br>
convinced that particular positions are right.  Now I realize it's<br>
more a matter of changing what is in the heart.  I think that is why<br>
Jesus did what He did.<br>

Yes, fellow netters, it's me again. Steve tells me that there was record<br>
amount of traffic while I was away. It's a good thing my node was off; it<br>
probably would've been beeping like an alarm clock.<br>
<p>
Let me detour a bit toward the reason for my absence. I had just taken a trip<br>
to my parents' homeland, the Philippines. As the bastion of Christianity<br>
and Catholocism in Asia, it comes as no surprise that many traditions and<br>
attitudes are formed by images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and the Rosary.<br>
<p>
It's not to say that Protestantism is not alive and well. Methodists and<br>
Presbys were the first major wave, followed by SDAs and Inglesia Ni Cristo,<br>
a variation on Catholocism and native religion. Now we see movements such <br>
as UCC, Assemblies of God, and LDS (which, BTW, has a beautiful modern<br>
structure and a great basketball court with clear backboards in my dad's<br>
hometown, Cheryl :) ) making major inroads. But the power of the papacy<br>
still holds sway.<br>
<p>
A report of the SDA church in the Philippines is in order. In talking<br>
to some of the churchworkers and laypersons in the central part of<br>
the area called the Central Philippine Union Mission (CPUM), the spreading<br>
of the gospel is alive and well. Churches are growing, and new churches<br>
are being formed from this growth. The vitality of the church lies in its<br>
youth and young adults, and I found such evidence at an annual youth<br>
sports day in a town outside Iloilo City. I can recall as many as seven<br>
area churches participating, with over 100 youth and young adults present<br>
in the town plaza playing volleyball and basketball. According to one of<br>
the youth leaders, this is one way that the church tries to keep its young<br>
people involved in the congregation instead of wandering to the city and<br>
getting involved in its evils.<br>
<p>
In Dumaguete, located southwest of Cebu, the church that began under a thatched<br>
roofed structure and dirt floors has become a cinderblock building with<br>
over 100 members. In talking to one of the literature evangelists who<br>
serves the area, he is very excited about the growth prospects in this area.<br>
With the increased activity in this relatively sleepy region due to the<br>
thermoelectric generator in this region, more people will migrate here, <br>
opening up a larger evangelistic field.<br>
<p>
In Manila, the Pasay City church and the adjoining Manila Sanitarium and<br>
Hospital now must compete against the massage parlours and bars with dancing<br>
hospitality girls that have moved out of Ermita and the areas where the<br>
American bases used to be. It is a great challenge, but one that the church<br>
there is prepared to encounter. <br>
<p>
There are signs of growth. I even noticed signs for a new SDA church <br>
between Las Pinas and Alabang, located south of Manila.  <br>
<p>
The RCC still is most dominant, though. This fact was hammered home many times.<br>
The parades, the celebrations of Maria, the messages. The most disturbing<br>
message came from a roadside sign. It said, "Better to die of old age than<br>
to die of AIDS." The RCC also opposes government efforts to distribute<br>
condoms in the fight against AIDS, claiming that it will only encourage<br>
promiscuity among the young and it opposes procreation. That in spite of<br>
the fact that people are now slowly waking up to the explosion of AIDS<br>
in Asia, including the Philippines. And the government so far has listened<br>
to RCC leaders.<br>
<p>
-----<br>
<p>
As far as the leisure side is concerned, I'd suggest Boracay. After you paid<br>
for an US$1100 round-trip ticket from Chicago to Manila and a roundtrip<br>
to Caticlan, where you take a small boat to the island, it's all white<br>
sand and clear water. Utterly beautiful. And a small cabin nearby the shore<br>
with varying degrees of amenities such as running water and electricity.<br>
Of course, you'll be fine if you don't mind the international aspect of the<br>
place, which includes all-night bars, souvenir booths, and, just recently,<br>
women sunbathing topless. I thought they weren't allowed to do that. Church<br>
thing, you know?<br>

I believe the discussion of whether the Jehovah's Witnesses, Worldwide<br>
Church of God, Church of God (7th Day), etc. are offshoots of the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist Church grew out of a reference to J. Gordon<br>
Melton's "The Encyclopedia of American Religions," (3rd edition),<br>
Detroit: Gale Research, 1989.  As a reference librarian, I thought I<br>
could make some additional comments on the book and its contents.  Our<br>
library's copy is in the Seminary Reference collection.<br>
<p>
First of all, let me say that it's an impressive reference<br>
book--accurate, and extremely thorough (as befits a publication from<br>
what is probably America's most important publisher of reference<br>
titles).  Almost 1600 different groups are listed.  I have never tried<br>
to find a group and not find it listed here.  It would be great to have<br>
to time to just sit and read it (but at over 1,000 pages, not<br>
likely--contrary to what many people think, reading is about the last<br>
thing librarians have time to do!).<br>
<p>
Rather than simply giving an alphabetical listing, Melton has divided<br>
the churches into 22 "families" (of which the Adventist family is #11,<br>
and the LDS family 93).  There are 84 groups listed under the Adventist<br>
family.  Melton includes a historical essay on each family, then a more<br>
detailed description of each church (in the directory section).  Sources<br>
are given.  Essentially, the churches in this section emphazize<br>
apocalypticism and millennialism.  These families are further sudivided<br>
into smaller groups.  The following are listed as Seventh-day Adventist:<br>
Branch SDA's, Davidian SDA Association, General Assn. of Davidian SDAs,<br>
People's Christian Church, the Registry, SDA Church, SDA Church--Reform<br>
Movement, Seventh Day Christian Conference, Unification Association of<br>
Christian Sabbath Keepers.  I suppose an argument can be made that some,<br>
if not all, of the above are "offshoots" of the SDAs.  Incidentally, the<br>
presence of so many independent churches that use the name SDA may have<br>
helped persuade the judge to decide against the SDA Church in its recent<br>
attempt to make the name a trademark, and subsequent lawsuit against SDA<br>
Kinship.<br>
<p>
To call the 7th Day Church of God an SDA offshoot is not technically<br>
correct (I have many relatives who are members of that church, or at<br>
least one of those churches), although some SDA history books may<br>
portray it otherwise.  I believe that these books would label the<br>
Messenger Party and Snook and Brinkerhof as those who departed from what<br>
was becoming the SDA Church.  As I recall, the authority of Ellen White<br>
and the sanctuary doctrine were among what this group rejected.<br>
<p>
I was interested in the comment by my colleage in the next building, Dan<br>
Turk, and I find that to a great degree I must agree with him.  Many in<br>
the church (certainly in the church hierarchy and bureaucracy) seem to<br>
value conformity rather than those who question (witness the Ford<br>
debacle).  In fact, it still remains an unanswered question (as it was<br>
30 years ago) whether the SDA Church can really operate a university<br>
(but that's another topic entirely!).  However, I would say that the<br>
church tends to value right thinking (i.e. believing correct<br>
doctrine--the Truth) over right doing (perhaps more emphasized by<br>
churches in the pietist and other traditions).  Think about it--compare<br>
the number of sermons you hear on what to believe as compared with how<br>
to live a successful Christian life.  I think there's room for growth<br>
here.  <br>

Well, since I talked about women elders, I guess I will go on record as supporting<br>
ordination of women as ministers.  I've never seen a problem with it.  I DO<br>
have a problem when a qualified, dedicated pastor is never ordained, or skippied<br>
over as a friend of mine has been.  It seems that ordination is used as a gal<br>
glass ceiling for men AND women. This person has been a dedicated minister,<br>
with a MDIV from Andrews for the past 10 years, and at one time was promised<br>
ordination, but before that happened, the confrence president who promised<br>
it was transfered (the great "Advent movement") and he had a conflict with<br>
the new guy, and so seems to have been left hanging.  To the extent that he<br>
has been forced to take a teaching job outside of the denomination to supp-<br>
ort his wife and kids.  He is a talented pastor, and a dedicated Adventist.<br>
My point here is, that it seems like the church uses Ordination for purposes<br>
of "professional birth control", whether it be female or maile.  I call for<br>
this to cease.<br>
Cheers<br>

<i>&gt; have heard of x number of women that have been denied, I'd like to know about</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  I don't think the seminary denies a disproportionate number of women to</i><br>
<i>&gt; men.  I am not saying that it doesn't happen...i just would be surprised.</i><br>
<p>
We're backsliding into the numbers game.  If only ONE woman is discouraged<br>
from following what might be God's will, it is one TOO MANY.  Have I gone over-<br>
board, or am too simple minded in returning to "what would Jesus do...?"<br>
<p>
Just want to say that I really do enjoy the discussions here, and what seems<br>
to be people, full of passion for Christ.<br>

Now _this_ is classic.  It probably has to do with the _way_ Jesus's life<br>
and ministry has been taught to us.  As a person with a "Social Work brain"<br>
it is clearly evident that Jesus had at least a two-fold ministry.  <br>
Luke 5:18-19<br>
*seems* to be talking about a gospel which is both spiritual and social.<br>
It goes along with loving "God with our whole hearts.... and our neighbors<br>
*as ourselves*."<br>
<p>
Too often I run through this text so fast, that I miss its power and potential.<br>
The call for me to love God supremely will not negate the call to love my<br>
neighbor.  In fact, Jesus's life appears to be showing that the two are <br>
married,<br>
or "joined together" in heaven.  How _does_ one love her/his neighbor<br>
as her/himself?  What exactly does it entail?  Is it in concrete, or does it<br>
change depending on my neighbor's needs?<br>
<p>
The gospel of Jesus is so powerful, and sweet.  As the revered rulers<br>
and teachers of old couldn't thwart its expanse, and ramifications, so it is<br>
today.  The writer of Isaiah 56:1-~8~ might be on to something... I'll have to<br>
study it more.<br>

<i>&gt; From: ruben@ee.uts.edu.au (Ruben Gonzalez)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why is it that neither Jesus nor the disciples never addressed the current </i><br>
<i>&gt; social issues of their day (eg slavery, infringement of human rights etc). These</i><br>
<i>&gt; issues were not petty or irrelevant yet Jesus never addressed them. Instead</i><br>
<i>&gt; of addressing them (Jesus could have effectively addressed various of these)</i><br>
<i>&gt; He taught the people to live with them, and even consider them hidden blessings.</i><br>
<p>
I think that we might be in some trouble by trying to fit our own world<br>
view on top of *really* foreign cultures...which describes almost everything<br>
in existence in the far past.  It's bad enough trying to filter events and<br>
thought and writings of only a century past through our current filter.<br>
<p>
Notwithstanding our current views of slavery, etc., I don't believe that<br>
it was an issue for almost anyone during the first century.  Right or<br>
wrong (I'm voting for wrong), it was probably seen as something that<br>
just was.  Do something about it?<br>
<p>
Jesus dealt with problems that faced everyone, slave or free.  Issues that<br>
could be understood as important by many, if not all, of the people that he<br>
had contact with.<br>
<p>
Note that the inevitable (at least, we *assume* them to be inevitable) result<br>
of the changes in thinking that followed the issues that he addressed did<br>
eventually result in changes in these other problems.  These changes couldn't<br>
have come about (or, perhaps, not without much greater social upheaval and<br>
shedding of blood) without the changes in world-view brought about by what<br>
Jesus *did* teach.<br>
<p>
If you've grown up in a culture where up to 90% of the total population is<br>
slave, in fact even if not in name, you're going to have to stretch quite a<br>
ways to see that things should change.  It's probably even harder if the<br>
slaves in question are made up of the same racial and ethnic composition as<br>
the non-slave population.<br>

I will try to summarize information on the deletions in some editions of<br>
the "Great Controversy" as found on pp. 28-29 of "Issues:  the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist Church and Certain Private Ministries."  I'm not<br>
sure I want to re-open that discussion, but shortly after it died down<br>
on this list, what should show up in my mailbox but a free copy of this<br>
almost 500 page book (apparently provided free to church employees in<br>
North America).  I know there was quite a stack for the library--I can<br>
only imagine the size truck it took just to deliver the Berrien Springs<br>
copies!  I would not have personally purchased the book (though of<br>
course the library would have gotten it), but since I had one, I have so<br>
far read part of it.  Actually, it seems quite balanced.  If anything,<br>
they provided more information than necessary (although as a librarian<br>
and historian I appreciate having copies of all the supporting<br>
documentation).  Without defending all decisions made by church bodies,<br>
it must be frustrating to have individuals and groups feel free to run<br>
around and make all kinds of (often exaggerated and/or unsubstantiated)<br>
tales without knowing how to respond without adding to the divisiveness<br>
or adding to their credibility.  I would also say that when I visit the<br>
GC, I also often note a certain defensiveness in the attitudes there,<br>
which I find unfortunate.  I don't want to get sidetracked on that.<br>
<p>
The issue of the deletions was raised by John Osborne (Prophecy<br>
Countdown) in one of his infamous videotapes (in this case, "The New Age<br>
Adventism") in which he correctly reports that some statements have been<br>
deleted in a Spanish version of the GC.  The NAD reply is that some<br>
years ago an antidefamatory law, which prohibited anti-Catholic<br>
publications, was passed in Argentina.  Church leaders there asked for<br>
an abridged version that could be sold in that country only until the<br>
ban was lifted.  After that an unauthorized reprinting of this (using<br>
the Pacific Press logo) was printed in the Caribbean (nothing is said<br>
about Mexico, which country, incidentally since their revolution has had<br>
very poor relations with the Catholic Church only recently being<br>
somewhat healed).  As is common with Osborne's pronouncements (and we at<br>
Andrews have had some first-hand experience with his statements), he<br>
makes this situation into a conspiracy.<br>
<p>
The NAD ends its defense in this case with a notation that during Ellen<br>
White's life, and with her permission, changes were made to GC to make<br>
it more appropriate for its intended public audience (specifically with<br>
reference to the first German edition).  They conclude, "Material that<br>
might be offensive to some in the foreign language can be deleted.  The<br>
Spanish edition discussed by Prophecy Countdown falls well within the<br>
accepted guidelines for editing English and foreigh language editions.<br>
These guidelines were established during Ellen White's lifetime and have<br>
been used ever since."<br>
<p>
I hope this sheds at least some light on the question.<br>

I respect Cheryl for her gracious answers to what could have been viewed<br>
as needling questions.  ...  While my understanding of Scriptures leads<br>
me to be an SDA rather than LDS, my contacts with LDS over the years<br>
leads me to appreciate many of their practices.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [From Cheryl Berthelsen  cherylb@csd4.csd.uwm.edu]</i><br>
<i>&gt; The LDS Church does not have paid clergy so all the Bishops and Elders</i><br>
<i>&gt; have regular jobs and perform their duties for the ward they are assigned</i><br>
<i>&gt; to on a VOLUNTEER basis.  How many SDA minister would minister to the church</i><br>
<i>&gt; members without pay while maintaining a fulltime job to support their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; families?</i><br>
<p>
The LDS church would seem unique in this policy; it perhaps bears mentioning<br>
that many evangelical and some denominational congregations are unable to pay<br>
their pastors sufficiently and so they must work additional jobs (and still<br>
carry a pastoral load; as Harvey B pointed out, many find this difficult and<br>
would prefer the SDA approach).  Next, it bears mentioning that our pioneers<br>
worked in this fashion (and some churches still do; the Buckeye, AZ, SDA<br>
church is served w/o pay by Chaplain Coleman, USAF).  Finally, in a related<br>
tho't, IMHO, "tent-maker" missionary work is a new opportunity that the SDA<br>
church appears to be tentatively exploring (e.g., ESL teachers in China) and<br>
which are other churches (e.g., Christian &amp; Missionary Alliance) are developing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; LDS missionaries are not paid during the</i><br>
<i>&gt; two years they serve the church.  In fact, their own families pay their</i><br>
<i>&gt; son or daughter's expenses.</i><br>
<p>
At some sacrifice, I imagine, which is a worthy attitude, praised by God.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Every member over 12 years old (male and female) is expected to contribute</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the spirituality of the ward in this way [talks].  It is quite unique, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe, because we hear talks from new converts, from seasoned life-time</i><br>
<i>&gt; members, and from the teens.</i><br>
<p>
My readings in Scripture and SoP so far indicate that members are to be far<br>
more involved in instruction, exhortation, and counseling, and pastors far less<br>
(so that they can address evangelism) than current practice (e.g., anecdotal<br>
evidence in EGW's Early Writings is remarkable in this regard).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; church supports many single parents (divorcees with kids) rather than have</i><br>
<i>&gt; them resort to government welfare. [my LDS friends tell me it's actually</i><br>
any member family. -FGC]<br>
<p>
Government welfare, esp members on welfare, is a stunning rebuke to Christian<br>
churches for failing to follow the apostolic model.  Thankfully, I am aware<br>
of many instances where SDA members provided for the needs of families in<br>
distress; and, alas!, some when they didn't.  My personal experience is that<br>
materialism leads many of us Christians into debt deep enough so that we do<br>
not have the extra $$ to help out when we see needs (re debt, see Rom 13:8,<br>
Deut 15:6, 28:12), a circumstance which we purposed to change 3 years ago.<br>
<p>
The two LDS friends who did the plumbing on my house are involved in a<br>
ministry to members, esp widows, wherein they do home repairs for free for<br>
anyone in need.  I have read of similar organized ministries in evangelical<br>
churches.  Perhaps there are SDA congregations who have similar.  And of<br>
course Maranatha Intl, et al, address keeping down the costs of church building.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The church visitation program in the form of home and visiting teachers</i><br>
<i>&gt; provides leadership and service for all men and women.  Each member or family</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the ward has a home teacher (man) who visits them in their home once/month</i><br>
<i>&gt; to deliver a spiritual message and see if they have any needs.  Each woman in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ward has a visiting teacher (woman) who visits once/month to specifically</i><br>
<i>&gt; minister to the woman's needs, both spiritual and physical.</i><br>
<p>
Ex-LDS friends found some of these teacher visits unacceptably intrusive<br>
into their financial and marital privacy.  Nevertheless, a well ordered<br>
visitation program has great merit.<br>

<p>
Several possibilities, my tho't being the last one:<br>
1)  God really doesn't care ... but I think we can dismiss this one, based<br>
    upon the evidence in Scripture.<br>
<p>
2)  God does care, but doesn't address the issues in revelation ... again,<br>
    I believe we can dismiss by examining the revelation in Scripture.<br>
<p>
3)  God does care, does address the issues in Scripture, but didn't while<br>
    Jesus was on earth.  I'll deal with the last part next and just<br>
    address Scripture here.<br>
<p>
    First, we tend to read Scripture with preconceived ideas of what<br>
    "addressing an issue" consists of, based upon contemporary methods.<br>
    This is risky, given Isa 55:8,9.  Second, we tend to want God to<br>
    straighten up others summarily, forgetting that God is as patient<br>
    with them as He is with us.  Therefore, don't expect God to impose<br>
    any social revolutions.<br>
<p>
	Sow an emphasis upon rights and you will reap rebellion (cf ISam 15:23).<br>
	Sow an emphasis upon responsibilites and you will reap reformation.<br>
<p>
    My readings of history (e.g., Code of Hammurabi, Canaanite practices)<br>
    and Scripture indicate God called Israel to high standards of sexual<br>
    morality, to vastly improved conditions for indentured servants<br>
    (called slaves, but our denotation involves property) as well as slaves<br>
    (Ex 21; Deut 15), to honoring one's wife and raising godly, Spirit-filled<br>
    children, to the compassionate treatment of widows and the fatherless.<br>
    The differences are signal.  God calls us ever onward to Christ-likeness.<br>
<p>
    One source of confusion to a great many is when Scripture tells us<br>
    what ought (God's best) vs what people actually did (the latter part<br>
    of Judges being an extreme example, summarized at the end "every<br>
    man did that which was right in his own eyes") vs what God permitted<br>
    given who He had (and still has) to work with (e.g., Mt 19:8).<br>
    Let us not assume that what God permitted is also His best.  More so,<br>
    let us not assume that what people did was always OK with God (a common<br>
    stumbling block to skeptic readers).<br>
<p>
4)  God does care, does address the issues in Scripture, and did touch<br>
    on them while Jesus was on earth; however His mission goals were of<br>
    such paramount nature that there was time only for fundamentals;<br>
    moreover, his audience was not Spiritually mature enough (Jn 16:12).<br>
<p>
Let me again emphasize the dangers of approaching Scripture from the basis of<br>
our contemporary ideas of "what ought" lest we misconstrue (2 Pet 1:20)<br>
or try to force conformance (Rom 12:2).  Rather, we start from Scripture,<br>
learn basic principles under the tutelage of the Holy Spirit, spiritually<br>
discern contemporary applications, and judge our culture thereby.<br>
<p>
Man seeks to make change my imposing from the outside (and does not always<br>
do so wisely).  God creates change from the inside out (Ps 51:10; Jer 31:33;<br>
Prov 3:3) within those who are willing (Ps 51:17).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; He taught the people to live with them, and even consider them hidden blessings.</i><br>
The testimony of a humble and gracious spirit, esp when personally wronged,<br>
is a powerful influence (Mt 11:29; Luke 23:34; 1 Pet 3:1-12; 1 Cor 6:7;<br>
1 Pet 2:18-23).<br>

It was in a Software Engineering class at Andrews University that the<br>
benefits of consensus-building rather than majority vote were first<br>
stressed to me.  (The teacher of that class shall remain nameless but<br>
she knows who she is).  The goal to work on our class software project<br>
through consensus<br>
rather than majority vote was a difficult one, and a new experience for lots <br>
of hard-nosed programmers.  Consensus-building effectively requires <br>
nonstandard management techniques to bring it about.  It leads to an<br>
organization described not in terms of hierarchical charts, but in terms<br>
of network topologies.<br>
<p>
It would seem that consensus is even more important in the church than in <br>
software engineering.  But in the church we are slipping down the slippery <br>
slope away from the consensus on the basic beliefs that forms the only ground<br>
of unity for Seventh-day Adventists.  We have now set a precedent by voting<br>
on something which both sides claim to be an issue of Biblical truth, namely<br>
the ordination of women.  I reject the idea that truth can or should be <br>
decided by majority vote.<br>
<p>
But even if anyone wanted to build consensus (and I believe the General<br>
Conference leadership does), where could they start?  In a company where <br>
one person is holding up the consensus, you can fire him or her.  A church<br>
can't fire its members, and besides, it's not just one person, it's all<br>
thirteen sides in the dispute, each claiming their way is right and all the <br>
others are extremist bigots and sexists and what have you.<br>
<p>
I despise the tactics of confrontation, sound bites, and all the other<br>
tools of the mediocracy which rules both our country and our church. <br>
Yet, if <br>
I attack those who are critical, I am being critical myself.  Also, I should<br>
be prepared to supply them a better way, and unfortunately history has shown <br>
that the church will not listen unless the dollar sign is involved.<br>
<p>
So what about it?  How do we make consensus when all the parties are saying<br>
"We can have consensus if everyone agrees with me"?  Is there a middle<br>
ground that isn't a morally bankrupt compromise like the current<br>
"scorched-earth" policy on ordination?  As long as we are at least still <br>
shouting at each other, there's hope.  Perhaps if the protagonists on both <br>
sides of this debate were all sent to Somalia as missionaries for three<br>
years, and had to learn to work together or die, we would have a chance<br>
of consensus building.<br>

With regard to the Great Controversy (Spanish Version), I believe that <br>
only in specific cases has it been 'edited' to meet anti-difamatory<br>
laws in a few Latin American countries.<br>
<p>
Mexico certainly has not be the case. Since the 1910 Revolution, Mexico<br>
has maintained a strict separation on church and state.  ONly during the<br>
current presidency of Salinas de Gortari, Mexico has formally exchanged<br>
representatives with the Vatican and the Catholic Church has been <br>
recognized by the government.<br>
<p>
The position to deffednd human rights and indigenous rights adopted by<br>
the church --which sadly enough was nevver shared by the SDA-- and its<br>
keen criticisms of the ruling PRI party policies have prevented the<br>
church-state relations from reaching the levvel that most Latin American<br>
countries enjoy.<br>
<p>
At any rate, the anti-Catholic discourse is seldomly used by the <br>
SDA church in Latin America officially (although many people use it<br>
indivvidually) andMrs. White's references to the Pope are usually<br>
kept from 'potential' SDA members until they are 'trained' into<br>
most other aspects of the doctrine.<br>
<p>
Indeed, one could argue that a rejection of thee papacy represents<br>
a formal and necessary step for belivers who are ready to baptize (that's<br>
is only an idea and don't quote me on it--please).<br>
<p>
BUt,no.  EGW's writings could hardly be censored in Mexico since many<br>
government's official publications were more critical ofthe Catholic<br>
Church than MRs. White herself.<br>

[From Drew Corrigan]<br>
<p>
Steve Timm asked: <br>
<i>&gt; [Some SDA folklore I have heard indicates that Armstrong's wife was a </i><br>
<i>&gt;  at one time.  Any truth to this?  SCT]</i><br>
<p>
I looked up the material I have on the history of the WCoG last night. The <br>
short answer to your question is "no". Mr Armstrong was raised a Quaker;<br>
Mrs Armstrong (nee Dillon) a Methodist. When they married they both <br>
attended the Methodist church. During a stay in Chicago they were quite<br>
involved in the social aspects of the "Forest Methodist Church". Mrs<br>
Armstrong had a strong interest in the Bible but Mr Armstrong never really <br>
had time for it.<br>
<p>
When they moved to Oregon their attendance became sporadic. Mrs Armstrong's<br>
interest in the Bible was reawakened by an elderly neighbour lady, Mrs Ora<br>
Runcorn. Mrs Runcorn took her through a study of the Sabbath and from that<br>
Mrs Armstrong was convinced to keep it. Mr Armstrong vigorously resisted this<br>
and endevoured to show his wife she was wrong. Between 6 to 12 months later, <br>
after independently researching it for himself, he came to agree with her and<br>
came to repentance. Mrs Runcorn and her husband were members of the Stanberry<br>
MO, congregation of the Church of God and the Armstrongs began to attend that<br>
Church with them.<br>
<p>
So, neither Mr or Mrs had any direct involvement with the SDA church. However, <br>
I would add that in those days ministers of the CoG7D cooperated to one <br>
degree or another with ministers from other Churches - Mr Armstrong made use<br>
of the SDA baptistry for example. Sometimes ministers from other Churches <br>
(not necessarily SDA) would join in CoG7D evangelical campaigns. So, there <br>
was some interaction going on at that time (late 1920's through 1930's).<br>
<p>

..what does the Lord require of you? To do justice, to love mercy, and<br>
to walk humbly with your God.<br>
<p>
Some would argue that the entire ceremonial law was set up to ensure<br>
that people treated each other with fairness and justice as much as<br>
possible at the time. Much of the writings of the minor prophets was<br>
directed at the issue of justice (eg Amos, Micah).<br>
<p>
Jesus' treatment of women and of gentiles was way off the accepted norm<br>
in his society. He may not have been one of those single-minded activists,<br>
but he was still a champion of human rights.<br>

I'm not sure about the pay, but I don't believe the duties of ordained<br>
and non-ordained pastors differ anymore.  Our pastor is not ordained<br>
(although he has an ordination interview scheduled) and he baptizes<br>
right along with the rest because he is _licensed_.  The IRS got into<br>
this awhile back and said that unordained pastors couldn't receive the<br>
ministerial perks if they somehow were not fulfilling all the functions<br>
of a minister: baptizing, marrying, etc.  This is how the female pastors<br>
get what little recognition they have -- they are licensed ministers,<br>
but not ordained.  Just as a point of interest -- why do people go to<br>
the seminary at all if they have no interest in it?  Our pastor does<br>
not even have a college degree and the administration is considering<br>
him as a candidate for ordination....  Come to Kentucky -- we can use<br>
you, even sans seminary training!<br>

I beg to disagree!  Clearly not _everyone_ agrees that Desmond Ford<br>
went wrong somewhere -- his independent ministry is thriving!  I also<br>
know personally many lay persons and pastors who believe Ford was on<br>
the right track.<br>

Ruben ask:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why is it that neither Jesus nor the disciples never addressed the current </i><br>
<i>&gt; social issues of their day (eg slavery, infringement of human rights etc). These</i><br>
<i>&gt; issues were not petty or irrelevant yet Jesus never addressed them. Instead</i><br>
<i>&gt; of addressing them (Jesus could have effectively addressed various of these)</i><br>
<i>&gt; He taught the people to live with them, and even consider them hidden blessings.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If He didn't and He is our example then to what extent should we ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Ruben :<br>
<p>
Jesus objective was not to change the world but to save the sinner,<br>
teaching us by example and word how we should live here and what we<br>
should look for.<br>
<p>
For the contrary, WE try to fix or change the church and those who are<br>
part of it.   The objective of Satan is just to distract our attention<br>
to subjects other than salvation.<br>
<p>
The SDA church grew a lot (in knowledge and number) when people were <br>
worried about knowing better the Scriptures rather than who is at the<br>
pulpit or what gender does mi pastor belongs to?  The SDA church in USA<br>
is not growing as much as before because our priorities have changed.<br>
<p>
Remember the church is just what we are.<br>

With regard to Sue Harrington's response to Bruce Holm...<br>
<p>
Right on Sue!  Tradition can bind us together.  That's its chief<br>
value and function.  Unfortunately, many traditions that are really<br>
rooted in our sociology and culture are treated as if they were<br>
absolute and timeless rather than relative and temporal.  When<br>
someone with a "love it or leave it" attitude insists on defending<br>
such traditions, I insist on disagreeing.  The current limitations<br>
on the role of women in the church are a good example of such<br>
blind devotion to a culturally determined tradition.<br>
<p>
Listen, I've seen enough 25 watt men in 100 watt leadership positions<br>
to know that the church needs all the help and talent it can muster.<br>
One of the reasons we can't solve some of our problems is that we<br>
can't agree on who gets to help.  I'm a male university professor at<br>
Montana State University.  Other than my doctoral dissertation I've<br>
published 4 books and have two more in progress.  I've an international<br>
reputation that has led to academic visits to Australia, Singapore, <br>
and Russia.  But guess what.  As far as I can tell, every SDA with<br>
a copy of Education considers himself/herself my equal when it comes<br>
to questions of educational philosophy and practice.  In fact, most<br>
Adventists believe that right decisions follow immediately from right<br>
philosophy.  Anyone who knows anything about the nature of expertise<br>
knows that that single belief can overrule the most articulate and<br>
well supported argument if it is permitted to function unchallenged.<br>
So, that's my "job" in the church, to challenge silly and bogus<br>
thinking whenever I see or hear it.  I'm staying, too ... and I'm<br>
going to give some people headaches who otherwise might blunder<br>
through entire careers without being called to account.<br>
<p>
Personally, I'd rather see a clear thinking woman on a committee<br>
anyday than some muddle-headed patriarch.<br>

Thanks, Dave. We need a lot more of you in the church insisting<br>
on accountability, clear thinking, and challenging the status quo.<br>

In a couple weeks I will put out a new edition of the SDAnet directory.<br>
Those who don't want their name listed should contact me, and anyone who <br>
has joined the net in the last month should send in information about <br>
themselves (name and occupation and city-state-country of residence).<br>
<p>
We are growing rapidly (135 members plus 12 on the digest) , well on <br>
pace to get 200 members by the end of the year.  This in turn is leading <br>
to a month of record traffic.  Over the next couple of days I may skip the <br>
morning posting to slow it down somewhat.<br>

I'll be quite open and confess that I'm a mugwump (mug on one side, wump on<br>
the other) on the issue of ordained lady ministers.  I've read some material<br>
which was not in favor and the writers seemed to have done a good job<br>
of marshalling Scripture, SoP quotes, and their own verbiage, in a clear,<br>
coherent manner, to support their position.  I trust, then, that those<br>
favoring it in the SDA church have prepared cogent, non-acrimonious position<br>
papers (or whatever) which delineate those Scripture verses and SoP<br>
quotations which they believe support their position.<br>
<p>
Could one of you kindly post an "executive briefing" type article to<br>
SDAnet and perhaps suggest some further reading so that I can understand.<br>
<p>
You see, the only thing that counts is whether or not it is in God's will<br>
(John 5:19,30).  If we're out of His will on this, we could get a big<br>
surprise (cf Acts 9:5).<br>

<i>&gt; From: AAGAARD%morekypr.BITNET@bitnet.cc.cmu.edu</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: Des Ford</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I beg to disagree!  Clearly not _everyone_ agrees that Desmond Ford</i><br>
<i>&gt; went wrong somewhere -- his independent ministry is thriving!  I also</i><br>
<i>&gt; know personally many lay persons and pastors who believe Ford was on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the right track.</i><br>
<p>
Having attended a number of Sabbath School classes presented by<br>
Mr. Ford while he was at P.U.C., I have a good deal of respect<br>
for him, and literal delight in much that he taught.<br>
<p>
Can't say I agree with *everything* he presented...but for me, his<br>
love of Christ and fellow believers and honorable behavior aren't<br>
in question.<br>

	Your message seems to say that speaking out on issues that aren't pronounced<br>
as the word "salvation", is changing our priorities, and ultimately the <br>
churches.  To a point<br>
this is true.  However, your tone of "voice" (if there can be one in <br>
netland) - - by phrases like,<br>
"knowing better the scriptures 'rather than' who is at the pulpit" - - <br>
gives the impression that<br>
attention to such things as discrimination in the treatment of women <br>
theologians, is a bad<br>
thing.  To this I must disagree.<br>
	Who on SDAnet has read the Desire of Ages?  I'm glad one religion teacher at<br>
WWC, Bud Roberts, had us read it, for his Life and Teachings of Jesus <br>
(LTJ) class.<br>
I tell you, my life has never been the same, and anytime I return <br>
there, I'm always renewed.<br>
If you haven't, please read it, and if you have, I promise that it <br>
won't harm you to read it again.<br>
To skip to the study of Daniel and Revelation, or the Great Controversy <br>
without keeping our<br>
hearts fixed on Jesus's life and teachings, we do our souls a GREAT <br>
disservice.  We are<br>
back to building communities of religious thought without the CORNERSTONE..<br>
Jesus is the one in the saving business, and we are only the <br>
messengers, inviting others.<br>
It is too easy for us to try and put Gods ability to work in a test <br>
tube, and only allow God to<br>
work in that confined area.  For God to work in a slightly different <br>
way or to use a different<br>
tool (which we are) is to spring a surprise on us - - "God, we forgot <br>
to tell you, 'we don't like<br>
surprises'."<br>
	I believe STRONGLY that the people who keep all of the commandments of<br>
God and the testimony of *Jesus*, will be the remnant, the end of the <br>
line of Christians...<br>
Christ copy-cats.  The time will come when there won't be anymore <br>
Adventist seminaries,<br>
won't it be nice to say, "before they chained our doors shut, we <br>
overcame prejudice."<br>
THIS MESSAGE IS ESPECIALLY FOR MARCUS STRINGER, THE *CHIEF* OF SINNERS.<br>
<p>
		What wondrous _love_ is this, oh my soul, oh my soul.<br>
		What _wondrous_ love is this, Oh My Soul.<br>
		What Wondrous love is _this_, that caused the Lord of<br>
		peace, to send His precious peace, to my soul,<br>
		to my soul.  To send his precious peace to *my* soul!<br>

Hi all,<br>
Even though I'm an "Active-PASSIVE" SDA Net, ( I am 98% reader almost all the t<br>
ime).<br>
I felt that I should give my "TWO BITS" of participation in this "HOT POTATOES"<br>
Women &amp; SDA/men's Church...<br>
And I guess, the best way to start it,is from the very beginning...<br>
First, let me clarify you all that my BIBLE is an old faschioned Portuguese<br>
Bible, ( I do NOT know if it came from KJV, NIV, Erasmus or whatsoever...) The<br>
only thing I can think of it is that: If to Santan was given the power to des<br>
troy all the BIBLES in the world (every versions) and from that remained just<br>
the Salms 23:1 (it would be enough) to assure the Salvation to all of us!<br>
Am I wrong? ... Ok, lets go to the issue; WOMENS and SDA Church..(men's church)<br>
I think (if someone show me I'm wrong I accept it) this very problem started<br>
very long long time ago, if not, lets take a trip with me to Eden's Garden:<br>
Is every one on board? Ok, good! Do you remember how did sin make its way to<br>
this world???? exactly... was right there... Gen 3 (all) describe it to us.<br>
(I'd like you all give a special attention to the verse 16... even though I onl<br>
y have read the intire Bible, twice in all my entire life, I think all this<br>
problem about women be or not be in charge of something have its roots right<br>
there. There were our first parents; Adam &amp; Eve and with them the SIN and with<br>
sin our decrect to death even before we were born... OK!<br>
<p>
4,000 thousands something years later... in Appostle's time, we find Paul<br>
Saying to the Conrinthos how should women be presented to the church....<br>
( I Corinthos 11). If that was not enough, in another accasion, the same<br>
Paul appears again, this time to the church of Ephesus telling to the<br>
.... Adventists of olds?!?! about the duties of the women... (Ephesus 5: 22-31)<br>
Well, if we as an Adventist, who have the "Holy Scriptures" as a rule of life,<br>
really believe in what is written on it, them we should use the Gamaliel's word<br>
(PHARISEE) as an example, and more... " We as a GOD's servants should do our<br>
part in the divulgation of the goospell, and let the results with GOD". Do you<br>
remember who said that? Yeah.. that's right, was her. BTW... Isn't she<br>
femminine? So why all this noise???<br>
<p>
Isn't the Bible the best guide (software) available to us?<br>
Isn't the SDA Church the best (Hardware developed) since 1844 to run this<br>
valuable "SOFTWARE"?<br>
SO, lets our "Eavenly Macrosoft developer" take care of the "Interfaces"<br>
&amp; lets make this 3rd msg routine running smootly to the END, with a nice<br>
OUTPUT.... Thousand &amp; Thousands of Gigapeople to Him who CREATES us!<br>

P.S. Sorry, I said in the beginning it was going to be "TWO BITS"<br>
     It was "Two Prophetics BITS"    :-)   ;-)  :-)  ;-)<br>

In addition to those who correctly point out that there is NO functional <br>
difference between ordained and non-ordained (licenced) ministers.  They <br>
baptize, perform weddings, conduct funerals, etc. with equal <br>
responsibilities. It is my understanding that this may only apply to the <br>
North American Division. (say, wasn't there some argument about all of us <br>
working in lockstep, er, "unity", or is this applied selectively????)<br>
<p>
In Southeastern California, and perhaps in other progressive conferences, <br>
it is both policy and practice to pay women who have qualified for <br>
ordination the same rate as if she had been ordained. There are, therefore, <br>
no functional or pay distinctions. All that is left is the imprimateur of <br>
the official church. I hope we overcome this one soon.<br>
<p>
Well, I am on "vacation" and am paying a 1-800 surcharge for this.... <br>
Perhaps, Steve, we need to talk about the summary?!<br>

Whenever I visit the Willow Creek Community Church in S. Barrington, IL,<br>
I have thoughts about thinking big.  This non-denominational church<br>
began in a theater in the 1970's with the goal of reaching the unchurched<br>
and the unsaved.  Along the way they have churched 12000 people,<br>
and have 3 full services, one on Saturday night and two on Sunday morning,<br>
filling their 4500-seat auditorium for each.<br>
<p>
The conventional church in N. America, Adventist or otherwise, begins with <br>
a small group of very excited people, builds a new church, grows to fill it,<br>
and then holds or declines from that membership on downwards.  There are <br>
many states in which you see a pattern of one church in each county. <br>
"Quality and not quantity" is only a slogan in those areas where the<br>
church<br>
thinks it can't get quantity.<br>
<p>
I'm glad our local church leadership here in Illinois is trying to think big.<br>
Currently we are airing the "Discover Jesus" series on local TV in<br>
preparation for the 5-day "Discover Jesus" seminar to be given by Mark<br>
Finley, followed up by a large series from a local pastor.  This series <br>
will differ both in scope and substance from what has gone before.<br>
<p>
I would like to see SDAnet join in thinking big, not only for the growth <br>
of SDAnet, but for the growth of the church at large.  I propose that <br>
we develop a list of "Problems we would like to have."<br>
<p>
First problem: People are lining up outside the church before we ever open <br>
the doors so they can get a seat.  <br>
<p>
Second problem:  Our 5000-car parking lot isn't big enough.  We have to start<br>
up a shuttle bus.<br>
<p>
Third problem:  More people want to be involved than we have jobs to<br>
give them.  We have to keep starting new ministries.<br>
<p>
Can others think of more?<br>
<p>

Hi,<br>
  I haven't posted to this net for a long while..<br>
<p>
but I just wanted to know if there are people out there who like listening<br>
to Michael Card's songs...and if they have figured out some chords to some<br>
of the slightly tricky songs.<br>
  Personally, I find his lyrics to be very inspiring(for want of a better word).<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>

There are songbook you know. If you cannot find any, I know many of his<br>

In the North American Division, licensed ministers may perform all the<br>
duties of an ordained minister.  However, their performance of such<br>
duties is limited to those churches in which they are ordained as local<br>
elders.  Any exceptions to this are to be approved by the local<br>
conference administration.<br>

Problem 4: Not enough houses in our Chicago sized town to cover<br>
the anxious members who want to go visiting to look for interested<br>
non-members.  Having to drive long distances to find people who<br>
haven't been visited.<br>
<p>
Problem 5: Overzealous youth group - wants to get involved in<br>
church outreach ministry all the time, and due to aforementioned<br>
problems, the ministry group is already bursting at the seams.<br>
<p>
Problem 6: Elderly over-cared for - They enjoy the visits, food,<br>
and help given to them by church members, but are unable to<br>
eat all of the food or find work for the eager helpers.<br>
<p>
Problem 7: Too many mission minded people - can't find overseas<br>
calls for all that want to go, even using student missions<br>
jobs.<br>

To Dave Johnson,<br>
<p>
I'm very curious about your statement that in SE CALIF Conf the female<br>
ministers are paid the same as male whether ordained or not.  Do these<br>
same unordained ministers received the GC perks such as retirement pension,<br>
25% of home mortgage, etc?  I doubt they do because the retirement system<br>
is sponsored by GC and since they have refused to recognize unordained<br>
women as ministers, I don't think they could legally either.<br>
<p>
Cheryl<br>
<p>
[I don't understand--GC pensions are available to other GC employees <br>
including teachers.  Also I have never heard of them paying 25% of anybody's<br>
home mortgage.  "Refused to recognize unordained women as ministers"<br>
is also incorrect.  The GC action of 1990 permits any licensed minister<br>
to conduct all activities of the ministry except organize a new church or <br>
ordain another minister.  (Perhaps with the restrictions mentioned by <br>
Warren Trenchard in his post.) Although the changes in the past few years<br>
may not be enough, they are nevertheless important.  SCT]<br>

Yes, yes, yes, the female licensed ministers employed by the SDA<br>
denomination HAVE to get the same perks as do the male licensed<br>
ministers -- this is an IRS requirement.  The IRS does not recognize<br>
ordination as anything special, so if the church has to treat ordained<br>
and non-ordained men the same and because we now hire women also, they<br>
are treated as the non-ordained men.  Did that get too convoluted?  If<br>
the women did not get the perks, then the church would be in very not<br>
(hot) water with the IRS.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
Here are some questions I have pondered at some length.  Would any of you<br>
be willing and able to point me to some answers?<br>
<p>
Old Testament Laws -- Their Applicability Today<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
1.  Of the many laws given in Exodus, Leviticus, etc... what principles do<br>
    we use to determine which are applicable today?<br>
<p>
2.  Are the specific laws important today, or just their underlying principles?<br>
<p>
3.  Elaborating on #1, SDAs still hold that the food laws are binding, the <br>
    reason being that they apply to health and are therefore not abolished with<br>
    the sacrificial system.  How about such laws as not were garments made from<br>
    more than one type of fabric?  How about various "camp" laws governing<br>
    infectious disease (skin diseases and the like)?  How about purity laws<br>
    (mensturating women going outside the camp)?<br>
<p>
I am searching for Biblical principles of interpretation here.  Adventists <br>
(rightly, I believe) have pointed to the Ten Commandments as have special<br>
significance (written with God's own finger).  But what about the others?<br>
Paul vigorously disposed of circumcision.  Is our basis for ignoring many<br>
of the Levitical laws the same basis Paul used to do away with circumcision?<br>
<p>
I have a theory covering some of these laws, but would like some help here.<br>
Any takers?<br>
<p>

This seems to conflist with your Statement of Beliefs which Steve Timm sent<br>

<p>
Though my experience with SDAs is quite limited, those I know seem to<br>
regard the food laws as binding. [FYI, the WCoG also teaches that the<br>
food laws are binding, though it does not promote vegetarianism or prohibit<br>
the consumption of alcohol.]<br>
<p>
Perhaps someone could clarify this for me?<br>
<p>
Thanks and regards,<br>

[There are different food laws in the Old Testament.  SDA's view the<br>
prohibition against unclean meats (which was known to Noah in Genesis 9)<br>
as something which predated the Jewish people and therefore applicable<br>
to all.  But something like "You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's<br>
milk"<br>
which Kosher Jews still interpret today as forbidding the mixture of <br>
meat and milk, we do not consider binding since this was part of the <br>
Law of Moses.  What I have said above is the church position.  Whether<br>
there is such a dichotomy between Law of God and Law of Moses,<br>
and if the unclean meats still hold in the light of Genesis 9, is <br>
open for discussion.  SCT]<br>

It is a question of why, rather than what. SDAs do tend to<br>
abstain from certain foods, but not in deference to the<br>
"food laws" as such. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It also means because our bodies are the temples</i><br>

<i>&gt;most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean </i><br>

<p>
ie, not "because it is part of God's law". SDAs are not in<br>
favour of rape either, and once again this is an attitude<br>
based on more than just the law, ceremonial, moral, or<br>
otherwise.<br>

In the 1991 Congressional Staff Directory Rep Bob Stump lists Seventh-day<br>
Adventist as his religion. Rep. Stump has served since Jan. 3, 1977. He<br>
lists his profession as "farmer" and his home as Tolleson, Arizona.<br>
<p>
He is Republican and serves on the Committee on Armed Services and  the<br>
Committee on Veterans' Affairs as the Ranking Minority Member.<br>
<p>
This is not surprising since he served in the U.S. Navy from 1943-1946.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, I first discovered Rep. Stump while watching C-SPANN.<br>
They listed the church affiliations and number of members with that<br>
affiliation one day. I noticed one SDA and determined to find out who it<br>
was. That took me to the 1991 Congressional Staff Directory. <br>

I have a problem with the word "binding".  We do NOT consider this "binding".<br>
They are laws that make common sense, but in no case are the mandatory for<br>
either church membership, OR salvation.  That is, you can't be disfellowshipped<br>
for not following the health laws in the old testament.<br>
<p>

I was interested to see that I am not the only one who has been struggling<br>
with the question of how to deal with OT laws.<br>
 <br>
Something to note in the matter is this:  In Acts 15 the Jerusalem council<br>
met to discuss which OT laws should be bound upon the Gentiles.  At issue<br>
really was whether a Gentile could be saved as a Gentile or whether a<br>
Gentile could only be saved by first becoming a Jew.  The council<br>
basically supported the encouraging of the Gentiles to look to the<br>
principles found in Leviticus 17-18; these dealt with sacrifices to idols,<br>
blood in animals, and sexual immorality.  Well, this covers the Gentiles,<br>
but what about Jewish believers?  Hebrews points to the redundancy of the<br>
priesthood system now that Christ has entered the heavenly sanctuary.  So<br>
in some sense the laws dealing with the sanctuary and priesthood here on<br>
earth are no longer applicable.  But what of the other laws?  There are<br>
still some ceremonial laws, civil laws, and health laws left out of the<br>
picture.  I am not sure where to go from here.<br>

Well, I don't think that the health laws "..were not done away with.."<br>
The entire old-testament system met it's anti-type in Christ.  The<br>
foodlaws have a timeless health benefit.  The underlying prinicple that<br>
leads the Adventist Church to subscribe to them, is the fact that we are<br>
the temple of God, and as such, we need to keep ourselves as healthy as<br>
we can.  Part of good health, (as we now know it today) implies that one<br>
cut down on cholesterol, etc.  Certain classes of meats are considered<br>
unclean, not so much from the ceremonial aspect, as from the health<br>
aspect.  Looking at the animals that are "permitted" one finds that they<br>
are all vegetarian for the most part.  Some are insect eaters, but none<br>
are carion eaters.<br>
<p>
One has to look carefully at the laws, and try to separate cultural<br>
aspects, from religous (ceremonial) aspects and health aspects.<br>
<p>
For example "leprosy of a house"..deals with green marks in and on the<br>
walls.  Most likely this refers to mildew or other fungi which ARE detrimental<br>
to one's health.  The mixing of cloth types is more problematic, but one<br>
needs to understand that there were no synthetic fibers, and each natural<br>
fiber has diffrent and unique properties.  The laws dealing with women<br>
may or may not be based on health laws, more likely they are cerimonial in<br>
nature, because they deal with blood emissions, and blood had some very<br>
heavy symbology associated with it.  One practical side might be present<br>
however, and that is synchronous mensus.  Apparently when women live<br>
in close proximity to each other, such as in a dorm setting, there tends<br>
to be a syncing of menus cycles.  It would be rather detremental to<br>
a LARGE group of nomads to have the majority of thier women in mensus<br>
at the same time.  Isolating the women may have helped eliminate that<br>
although we don't know for sure.<br>
<p>
Obviously the injuctions against incest and homosexuality are based on rather<br>
sound principles, both geneticaly, and emotionaly.  Many of the leveitical<br>
laws can be understood in the light of general medical knowlege today, which<br>
knowlege was not present at the time that they were needed, and so God<br>
gave the laws in a manner that the people of the day could understand, couched<br>
in cerimonial symbolism.<br>
Cheers<br>

<i>&gt; American's United for Separation of Chuirch and state.  It seemed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; imply that they were a greater danger to Religious Liberty than Jerry</i><br>
<i>&gt; Falwell.  Also this post seemed to attack the principle of Separation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Church and State.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No one questioned him.  I must be completely out of touch for I am a</i><br>
<i>&gt; member of that organization and I do believe in the principle of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Separation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would like to hear other views.</i><br>
<p>
I'm in favor of separation too, but I also have trouble with this<br>
organization.  Several reasons:<br>
<p>
	1.  They focus on particular issues (like Sunday laws or being<br>
	forced to work on Sabbath), but totally ignore other religious<br>
	liberty issues like school choice, taxes, government control<br>
	of social policy, and so on.<br>
<p>
	2.  They don't address the issue of if and when public policy<br>
	should be based on religious principles.  If, for example, we<br>
	lived in a totally atheistic nation, to be consistent laws<br>
	would have to be based on the principle of "might makes right"<br>
	from evolutionary biology.  I'm not sure I would wish to live<br>
	in such a country.<br>
<p>
	3.  They seem to read too much into individual cases, e.g. the<br>
	peyote case in Oregon.  I think you can pick up on the trend<br>
	of religious liberty by looking at collections of cases over<br>
	time, but I don't think that any one decision implies that the<br>
	end is nigh.  If you cry wolf too often, eventually you lose<br>
	your effectiveness.<br>

All this talk about laws I find interesting!  I am currently doing resurch<br>
to write a 7 to 10 page paper on Romans 6:12-14.  The vs. 14 states that<br>
we are no longer under law [at all] but under grace.  I have been stuck on<br>
that more than any other part of the verses.  I'm not sure how to take<br>
that.  Reference to Ex. 20? or all of the OT laws  or what?  (at all was<br>
added for my emphases)<br>
<p>
I would really like to see your views!<br>

<p>
First off, this is a fine line.   Religion has given the "world" a history,<br>
(something the world can put it's fingers on) of "misuse" (I'm being<br>
extremely kind) of power in the name of Christ.  This is terrifying,<br>
when the common person's mind can't imagine those things ever<br>
being thoughts in the mind of the Christ, Jesus seems to portray.<br>
The Church has even stomped over governments of the land in order<br>
to do what it wants.  We reap this heritage, and these iniquities are<br>
visited upon the religious children unto the third and forth generation.<br>
Now for me to forget, or worse, _ignore_ this, makes me more than a<br>
fool.  Now we have the opposite extreme, government with it's hand<br>
in the cookie jars and bowls, pots and pans.  Obviously there must<br>
be some governmental controls (especially when they uphold<br>
with the higher principles of God's law in how we are to relate to each<br>
other) if the Church fails to uphold them - - which is a SAD commentary<br>
for the Church.<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;	2.  They don't address the issue of if and when public policy</i><br>
<i>	&gt;	should be based on religious principles.  If, for example, we</i><br>

<i>	&gt;	from evolutionary biology.  I'm not sure I would wish to live</i><br>
<i>	&gt;	in such a country.</i><br>
Now _this_ is an EXCELLENT issue you've brought up.  I hope we can discuss it<br>
before the Sunday Blue Laws and capital punishment are supported by law.<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;	3.  They seem to read too much into individual cases, e.g. the</i><br>

<i>	&gt;	your effectiveness.	</i><br>
I think this is true.  Which affirms my suspicion that  this <br>
organization is human.<br>
Yet this is a sticker bush we're beating.  It can be said that, surely <br>
a small group<br>
(in comparison to the rest of the worlds religions) like Sabbath keepers who<br>
refuse to support our (moral majority) oppression of the "immoral" through<br>
political strong arming, are truly children of the devil and support <br>
his agenda.<br>
In this, I can see how if it were possible, even the elect (those "hand <br>
picked" for<br>
the kingdom) might be deceived.<br>
<p>
Good discussion!  Anymore thoughts?<br>

(Or, why do all my replies to SDA-L messages bounce back to me?)<br>
<p>
This is one of the posts that I have prepared in the last while that is<br>
going to be part of our Frequently Wondered but Never Asked Questions.<br>
<p>
SDA-L is a LISTSERV list run out of LLUVM.Bitnet .  It was founded by <br>
Enoch Hwang (math faculty at then-Loma Linda now-La Sierra) and<br>
Christine Hwang (his sister, now an MD in Toronto, Canada). They started<br>
in late 1990, a few months after SDAnet.  Their goal was to make a list<br>
mainly for fellowship and discussion among SDA students and faculty <br>
at colleges.  They did not expect a large doctrinal component.  In early <br>
1991 the two nets had about the same membership, 40 each, with some overlap.<br>
<p>
I discovered SDA-L in January and proposed joint distribution of the <br>
messages of the two networks.  This began in March 1991 and lasted <br>
for two months.  The combination of two nets full of loudmouths<br>
and the lack of moderation made a record traffic month that stood for 18<br>
months.  Some on the SDA-L side didn't like it because of the volume<br>
(both number and intensity of messages), and the heated doctrinal<br>
discussions.  I didn't like it because nothing from the SDA-L side was <br>
moderated and a lot of people's feelings were getting hurt.  Plus<br>
my people couldn't respond directly to the messages from SDA-L because<br>
they weren't members.  So when the two-month trial ended, we agreed that<br>
joint distribution should be dropped, and the traffic on SDA-L, although<br>
unmoderated, should confine itself to the original goals of the list, <br>
at least for a while.  I issued an invitation to all the SDA-L loudmouths<br>
to come on over to SDAnet, which they did.  Immediately the SDA-L traffic<br>
dropped to almost zero and has stayed there to this day.<br>
<p>
In May of 1992 I was asked to replace Christine Hwang as listowner in <br>
charge of membership and subscriptions, and now I handle the day-to-day<br>
maintenance of that list as well.  Enoch Hwang remains the listowner<br>
in charge of relations with the systems people at LLUVM.   He has had <br>
plans to move the list to La Sierra's Internet node for quite some time<br>
now, but I have heard nothing recent about that in several months.<br>
<p>
We continue to echo all SDA-L messages to SDAnet.  They come to you,<br>
as to their other readers, without the intervention of a moderator.<br>
Since SDA-L tags itself as the sender of all SDA-L messages, your replies<br>
will go there if you specify "Reply to sender".  I try to tag all SDA-L<br>
messages in the subject line so people will notice that something actually<br>
does come from there once in a while.  If you are not a member of SDA-L,<br>
your posts to there will be rejected.  However, if you are a member of<br>
both SDA-L and SDAnet, you will get double copies of SDA-L messages<br>
(not that you should worry.)<br>
<p>
To become a member of SDA-L send the message to LISTSERV@LLUVM.Bitnet<br>
<p>
SUB SDA-L Your Name<br>
<p>
To sign off SDA-L send this message to LISTSERV@LLUVM.Bitnet<br>
<p>
SIGNOFF SDA-L<br>
<p>
To avoid receiving double copies of SDA-L messages send this message<br>
to LISTSERV@LLUVM.Bitnet<br>
<p>
SET SDA-L NOMAIL<br>
<p>
<p>
All SIGNOFF's and SET's are sent to me for processing since the list is <br>
set up that way.  And don't ask if we can merge the lists because when <br>
I became a listowner of SDA-L it was with the specific mandate not to merge<br>
the two lists, or change the nature of SDA-L.<br>
<p>
To summarize the differences between SDA-L and SDAnet<br>
<p>
SDA-L                         SDAnet<br>
45 subscribers + all SDAnet   135 subscribers<br>
<p>
Low traffic (1-10 per month)  high traffic (60-225 per month)<br>
<p>
Unmoderated                   Moderated<br>
<p>
LISTSERV list                 sent out by hand and kludges,<br>
                              run by a real person.<br>
<p>
SDA fellowship and support    Those issues plus anything else<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SDAs do *not* officially see the food laws as still binding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Our dietary practices have more to do with general health principles</i><br>
<i>&gt; than with staying kosher. That's the official line, anyway. Individual </i><br>
<i>&gt; SDAs may disagree.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
huh ? I was not aware of this, from when did this change occur ?<br>
I thought the official line was that we did see the food laws as binding.<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>
<p>
[Neither Tony or Ruben has defined what they mean by food laws.<br>
I suggest that both of them should do that before anyone else responds<br>
to this thread.  In particular, do you include or exclude the prohibition<br>
against unclean meats in "food laws"  SCT]<br>

I have generally enjoyed reading sdanet postings, but I confess a growing<br>
disinterest in discussion that focuses on the kind of subjects that <br>
gets the John Osbornes of the world apoplectic. Sometimes the<br>
postings wander off into that territory. Historically Adventism<br>
began with a focus on those areas where we theologically differed<br>
from other Christians and in my church experience there has always<br>
been a segment of the church population that has been very concerned<br>
about topics that seem esoteric to most non-Adventist Christians,<br>
let alone pagans. Ironically, those most zealous seem to fall on<br>
that end of the spectrum, while those who see more grey than black &amp;<br>
white tend to be less so. I guess introspection can be incapacitating <br>
but it doesn't _have_ to.<br>
<p>
Enough reflection. To illustrate how wonderful :-) theological<br>
random walks can be when married to other disciplines I offer the<br>
following which I found in a list of quotations the other day:<br>
<p>
The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed. Our authority<br>
is Isaiah 30:26, 'Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as the light of<br>
the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven<br>
days.'  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much radiation as we do from<br>
the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much as the Earth does from the<br>
Sun, or 50 times in all. The light we receive from the Moon is one 1/10,000<br>
of the light we receive from the Sun, so we can ignore that... The<br>
radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where the heat lost<br>
by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven<br>
loses 50 times as much heat as the Earth by radiation. Using the<br>
Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute<br>
temperature of the earth (-300K), gives H as 798K (525C). The exact<br>
temperature of Hell cannot be computed... [However] Revelation 21:8 says<br>
'But the fearful, and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake<br>
which burneth with fire and brimstone.' A lake of molten brimstone means<br>
that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, 444.6C. We<br>

Steve,<br>
<p>
I hope this is not a dumb question, but do we (SDAnet) have an FAQ list that<br>
get sent out every so often, like other newsgroups? In addition to the<br>
directory that comes out every so often, I'm guessing an FAQ list could<br>
help a lot of people, especially in anticipation of that record number<br>
of subscribers you anticipate.<br>
<p>
[I'm working on it.  most of the pieces are in hand.  SCT]<br>
<p>
And, as long as we're on the subject of subscribing, I'm thinking about<br>
subscribing to either CompuServe or America OnLine in the near future.<br>
Any ideas?<br>
<p>
--stan<br>
[We have SDanet members that subscribe to both.  America Online has <br>
no surcharge for sending to and from the Internet, in this respect it<br>
stands alone, as far as I know.  SCT]<br>

Members of SDAnet who are interested in the relationship of OT dietary<br>
practices to NT Christianity will find some helpful insights in an article<br>
published in "Spectrum" a dozen years ago. Written by John C. Brunt, a NT<br>
ethicist who is currently vice president for academic administration at<br>
Walla Walla College, the article carried the title "Unclean or Unhealthful?<br>
An Adventist Perspective" and appeared in vol. 11, no. 3 (February 1981),<br>
pp. 17-23. It stirred up some discussion, and a couple of letters were<br>
published in vol. 12, no. 1 (September 1981), pp. 71-72, together with<br>
Brunt's response. Whether or not one agrees with Brunt, his contribution<br>
to the Adventist discussion of this topic should not be ignored.<br>
<p>
SDAnetters who are interested in SDA members of Congress will want to know<br>
of the two who identify themselves as Adventist. One is<br>
Represenatative Richard Stump, a relatively long-time member from Northern<br>
Arizona who is not, I believe, officially a member of any Adventist<br>
congregation but has family ties to the church and gives "Seventh-day<br>
Adventist" as his religious preference. He is, I understand, involved in<br>
ranching and real estate. The other is Roscoe Bartlett, a<br>
recently-elected representative from Maryland and a practicing Adventist.<br>
I believe he holds a Ph.D. in engineering and has been connected with<br>
Johns Hopkins University. (Since I am not personally acquainted with<br>
either of these congressmen, this information is second-hand and should be<br>
regarded as such.)<br>

Dear Scott, here's how i understood it when i read the text in question:<br>
The power of sin is the law, says Paul, and this is true inasmuch as sin<br>
is the breaking of the law, the penalty of which is death. Since Jesus the<br>
righteous judge has paid the fine for us, the offenders, with His own life,<br>
we nolonger receive the penalty, the power of sin is gone, there is no more<br>
condemnation for us. Before, we were under the death sentance. Now that<br>
Jesus has taken our place, we have been set free from death.<br>
	I think you should not stop at verse 14 but read the rest of the<br>
chapter and even the next chapter too. It is all talking about us and the<br>
law. I do not think this can refer to any other than the absolute moral law<br>
of God, which is the expression of His character and which we call the 10<br>
commandments.<br>
	regards,<br>
		beng tang, singapore<br>

I subscribe to both Compuserve and America Online.  You are right in that the<br>
AOL (America On Line) does not charge for a message sent to/from the service.  <br>
Compuserve, on the other hand, does charge 10 Cents per message.  Can get quite<br>
expensive in a hurry.<br>
<p>
America Online (shameless plug here) is a pretty good service.  I like it alot.<br>
I especially like the on-line chat forums that you can go into.  AOL calls them<br>
"rooms" where others of like or un-like interests can gather and discuss the<br>
issues or just talk.<br>
<p>
Sadly, most of the rooms seem to have titles like "men4men" and so on.  There is<br>
however, a Christian group that meets every Sunday night.  I have been trying<br>
to round up support on AOL for a Sabbath evening get together of SDA's on the<br>
system.  Been kinda hard getting everyone together so far.  But, hope springs<br>
eternal..... 8-D<br>
<p>
If you or anyone else would like further information, please email me.  I will<br>
be happy to respond (really shameless plug, eh?)<br>
<p>
God bless.<br>

What I meant by "food laws" was any law referring to what can and cannot<br>
be eaten. The way I understand it, SDAs believe that the ceremonial law<br>
system *as law* no longer stands. This seems to be supported by the<br>
quotation from "SDAs believe" posted by Drew(?).<br>
<p>
This is not to say that SDAs disregard Biblical advice as to what should<br>
and should not be eaten. We see the Eden diet as the ideal, with the<br>
post-flood omnivorous diet as second best.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;All this talk about laws I find interesting!  I am currently doing resurch</i><br>
<i>&gt;to write a 7 to 10 page paper on Romans 6:12-14.  The vs. 14 states that</i><br>
<i>&gt;we are no longer under law [at all] but under grace.  I have been stuck on</i><br>
<i>&gt;that more than any other part of the verses.  I'm not sure how to take</i><br>
<i>&gt;that.  Reference to Ex. 20? or all of the OT laws  or what?  (at all was</i><br>
<i>&gt;added for my emphases)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would really like to see your views!</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Seeing as the request has been made public, if it was not so already,<br>
as I recall reading the original article.....<br>
<p>
Here is a reply to this question, I think originally came out of <br>
"Questions on Doctrine", (?) or some other old SDA book, I don't remember<br>
which one I got it from, I just had the quote online.<br>
<p>
----------------------------<br>
<p>
This article addresses the issue of what UNDER THE LAW Rom 6:14 really<br>
means.<br>
<p>
"The Christian is not under law, but under grace."<br>
Is he then under grace to steal? Can he steal gracefully ?<br>
<p>
"What then shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace?"<br>
"Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid." No Christian<br>
is under grace to break the fourth commandment any more than he is under <br>
grace to break any other, but men missapprehend the meaning of the <br>
expression "not under law, but under grace". <br>
<p>
Let me illustrate: Here is a man guilty of murder. He is condemned to die;<br>
but a merciful governor interposes, and pardons the culprit. He is now <br>
under grace. Does that mean he has now got "indulgence" to murder ?<br>
Rather , are not gratitude and love to his benefactor new incentives <br>
nevermore to break the law ? <br>
<p>
"Not under the law"; Now a man must be either *under* or *above* the law,<br>
and he who is above the law is above the Lawmaker.<br>
<p>
It is a common concept that all unconverted people are "under the law"<br>
whatever being "under the law" may mean. As to the idea that the expression<br>
"Ye are not under the law" refers to freedom from its requirements, or at <br>
least freedom from the requirements of the fourth commandment to keep the <br>
seventh day Sabbath, it must follow that the expression "under the law,"<br>
means obligation to obey it, seventh-day Sabbath and all. Therefore it would<br>
be a sin for an unconverted man to break the Sabbath, while for the converted <br>
man it would be no sin at all. In other words the Lord holds the sinner<br>
responsible for his transgression of the commandments, while the <br>
saint is a liberty to transgress them at his pleasure, and no condemnation<br>
rests upon him! It would seem that the absurdity of such a conclusion <br>
would prevent anyone form adopting such a concept. Concequently we must <br>
look for some other meaning for the expression, "Ye are not under law,"<br>
and we assert with all confidence that its meaning, as used in this place<br>
is "Ye are not under *the*condemnation*of the law". The rest of the verse<br>
shows that this is its true meaning. Read the whole passage: "ye are not <br>
under the law, but grace." The contrast is between being under the law,<br>
and being under grace. What is grace ? It is unmerited favor; and to be <br>
"under grace" would signify to be under unmerited favor. But why is an<br>
unmerited favor granted unless the one who receives it is under <br>
condemnation? It is not an act of grace to permit one to live who has never <br>
forfeited his life, but it is an act of grace to grant life to one who<br>
who has brought himself under the condemnation of the law in transgressing <br>
it.<br>
	It is true that "there is now no condemnation to them which are in <br>
Christ Jesus," but as it is the law which condemns the sinner, it is the <br>
righteousness of the law which must be fulfilled in him, in order that he<br>
may be free from its condemnation; and so we read: "for whta the law could<br>
not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own son in the <br>
likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the <br>
righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the <br>
flesh, but after the Spirit."<br>
	It is sin, the transgression of the law which has placed us "under<br>
the law", under its condemnation; but it is the grace of Christ which has<br>
liberated us, made us free from condemnation. The law condemns the sinner,<br>
The grace of God releases him from condemnation. It releases him, not to <br>
sin again, but to fulfill in him hte righteousness, the requirements, of the<br>
law. Now to what extent can the righteousness of the law be fulfilled in the <br>
sinner? Only to the extent of his ability and knowledge; and his failure to <br>
meet the requirements of the law on account of his lack of knowledge is not<br>
imputed to him as sin, but in its place he has imputed to him the <br>
righteousness of Christ. Christ has met the rquirements of the law in all<br>
its length and breadth, to its fullest extent, Sabbath and all. And when<br>
His righteousness, his doing of the law is imputed to the sinner, it can<br>
be truely said of him that he is "not under the law, but under grace."<br>

Cheryl asks (I paraphrase) "Do unordained women receive the same GC perks?"<br>
<p>
Regarding participation in the retirement plan, an unequivocal YES. There <br>
haven't been many women in ministry who have reached retirement age, but I <br>
know of at least one in this conference. The settlement amounts on <br>
retirement depend on a complex set of factors including years of service <br>
and highest pay level attained (even if reduced later, as a conference <br>
president returning to a full time pastorate), but the benefits are alike <br>
whether the retiree is male or female. Since Southeastern California pays <br>
unordained but otherwise qualified women at the identical rate as ordained <br>
men, a man or women with equal time of service would receive exactly the <br>
same settlement.<br>
<p>
I am not clear what is meant by "25% home mortgage."  If you mean the <br>
parsonage allowance, all women pastors (and unordained men) are entitled to <br>
claim it, and in SECC all have.<br>

Hi Tim,<br>
	Please relay this to SDAnet.  I got the message returned to me from cmu's <br>
postmaster saying that my return path was not correct.  If you got the <br>
previous one then please ignore that and relay this as it has a few <br>
corrections.  Thanks:-)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i> &gt; The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed. Our authority</i><br>
<i> &gt; is Isaiah 30:26, 'Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as the light of</i><br>
<i> &gt; the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven</i><br>
<i> &gt; days.'  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much radiation as we do from</i><br>
<i> &gt; the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much as the Earth does from the</i><br>
<i> &gt; Sun, or 50 times in all. The light we receive from the Moon is one 1/10,000</i><br>
<i> &gt; of the light we receive from the Sun, so we can ignore that... The</i><br>
<i> &gt; radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where the heat lost</i><br>
<i> &gt; by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven</i><br>
<i> &gt; loses 50 times as much heat as the Earth by radiation. Using the</i><br>
<i> &gt; Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute</i><br>
<i> &gt; temperature of the earth (-300K), gives H as 798K (525C). The exact</i><br>
<i> &gt; temperature of Hell cannot be computed... [However] Revelation 21:8 says</i><br>
<i> &gt; 'But the fearful, and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake</i><br>
<i> &gt; which burneth with fire and brimstone.' A lake of molten brimstone means</i><br>
<i> &gt; that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, 444.6C. We</i><br>
<i> &gt; have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
 <br>
 I deduce that your calculations are based on the assumption that the <br>
atmospheric content of Heaven is the same as that on Earth....which would <br>
logically follow from the hypothesis that the same content is needed to <br>
support our earthly frame.  Since we will have a different body. So in <br>
computer-speak your base case in the proof by induction is flawed, I must say <br>
that the logical conclusions are invalid.<br>

One should note beside the other things mentioned so far about ROmans<br>
6:14, that there appears to be in Romans an equivalence between being<br>
under the law and being sold to sin.  FOr THis can be seen in Rom. 6 when<br>
he is talking about being a slave to sin.  It is even in verse 14.  FOr<br>
Paul sin used the law to bring a death sentence upon him.  THis comes out<br>
in the interesting personification of sin in Rom. 7.  SOme other Pauline<br>
insights I have come across lately are :  IN RROm. 12 one has some<br>
parallels to Jesus' sermon on the mount.  In Galations there are some<br>
parallels to Hebrews -- Gal. 4:22-31 and hHebrews 12:18-29. <br>

I just heard on the radio a few minutes ago that there was a shootout<br>
in Waco, TX in which 2 federal agents and many "cult members" as they <br>
said, were killed.  I didn't pick up the name of the so-called cult<br>
but they claimed it was an offshoot of the SDA church.  the something<br>
Davidians.<br>
<p>
The only offshoot I've heard of with that kind of philosophy is the <br>
Shepherd's Rod.  Would this be connected?<br>
<p>
Texas correspondents, please fill us in!<br>

I believe that the Davidians and Shepherd's Rod are very closely related.  My<br>
memory fails me, but it could be that that the publication of the Davidians is<br>
called The Shepherd's Rod.<br>

According to reports received so far, the leader of the group was an <br>
Adventist. However he was disfellowshiped more than 10 years ago. <br>
<p>
<p>
I've also received word that the Adventist Church in Fredrick Maryland, a <br>
large edifice that was worth nearly $1 million or more, was burned down on <br>
Sunday. This has been a busy day for the church.<br>

According to reports received so far, the leader of the group was an <br>
Adventist. However he was disfellowshiped more than 10 years ago. <br>
<p>
<p>
I've also received word that the Adventist Church in Fredrick Maryland, a <br>
large edifice that was worth nearly $1 million or more, was burned down on <br>
Sunday. This has been a busy day for the church.<br>

I just heard the same report about a shootout between <br>
federal agents and a heavily armed "cult group" in Waco,<br>
Texas.  Apparently 4 agents and at least one group member<br>
were killed.  The group is the Branch Davidians, and the <br>
confrontation apparently started when agents tried to arrest<br>
the leader, Vernon Howell, for violation of gun control laws.  <br>
The report did identify this group as an offshoot of the SDA <br>
church.  Hopefully someone else knows more...<br>

<i>&gt;SDAnet,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One of my teachers at the university said that she doesn't accept</i><br>
<i>&gt;Christian believes because she can't understand how God could be</i><br>
<i>&gt;love if He demands a sacrifice (see John 3:16).  She finds the idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;that Jesus on the cross would manifest God's love incomprehesible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What would you say to this educated woman who does believe in supernatural,</i><br>
<i>&gt;in some "greater power" or "universal love" but not in "our" God ??</i><br>
<i>&gt;I wasn't able to give her a good answer and I'd really like to know </i><br>
<i>&gt;what you would have said!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;				Minna</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Minna,<br>
Let me give this a try:<br>
If God's love does not accept sacrifices, <br>
   then God must accept sin.<br>
If God accepts sin,<br>
   then Satan must rule,<br>
  because his accusation of God's love cannot be refuted<br>
  and Adam, me, and everyone else must live in sin - which God condones.<br>
<p>
It is because of His love that we have sacrifice (I'm in trouble already).<br>
Furthermore, it's because of His love that the sacrifice was not you, me, your<br>
professor, Adam, or even an angel in heaven but His own beloved Son.<br>
He would not hold back anything to redeem us.<br>
<p>
If God accepts sin, then He must cease to exist and Satan will have to assume<br>
rulership of God's universe or all of us must accept chaos.<br>

Magic Johnson was baptized as a boy by Dr. Leslie Anderson who was then pastor<br>
in Michigan and currently serving as the Health/Temperance and Inner City <br>
Director for the Northern California Conference. His family were charter <br>
members of the church that was formed after a crusade. His mother and sisters <br>
are still active members in that church. Dr. Anderson met with Magic a few <br>
months back in Sacramento, CA to appeal to him to return to the religion of <br>
his youth. Two Elders from the Roseville Church near Sacramento also met with <br>
Johnson. This information comes from a personal conversation with Dr. Anderson<br>
and the pastor of the Roseville church. Both are personal friends of mine.<br>

In response to Minna's query, I have also heard Adventists question<br>
whether the Lord really required the sacrifice of Christ.  I'm sure<br>
this question has been discussed in great depth over the centuries.<br>
One answer is that justice demands a punishment for sin.  I think a<br>
better and deeper answer is respect for free will.  Part of free<br>
will is that our choices have consequences.  If we could shoot a gun<br>
but the Lord stopped the bullet before it did any harm the our free<br>
will would be to some extent limited.  However, we don't always know<br>
exactly what the consequences of our actions will be.  Sin is a<br>
choice to rebel, and even to harm another.  In order to respect our<br>
free will, someone has to suffer when we sin.  The Lord transferred<br>
the suffering to Christ.<br>

I grew up long enough ago in a conservative enough part of Michigan that <br>
the signals were mixed on Halloween.  My best friends family didn't <br>
celebrate Halloween, arranging to be gone from their house that night.<br>
My folks only dressed me up in costume once, as I recall, the year I was<br>
in public school kindergarten and all the kids came to school in costume,<br>
although I went for "trick or treat" several other times and we would <br>
always give something to those that came to our door.  One year we gave<br>
out Little Friends and Junior Guides.<br>
Of course, later on Halloween became associated with collecting cans for the<br>
poor and homeless once we got into Pathfinders.<br>
<p>
Two years ago at Elmhurst, IL we had a liturgically-minded social committee<br>
director who called for celebration of Halloween as All Hallow's Even,<br>
since indeed it was at one time a religious festival preceding the major<br>
celebration of All Saints Day.  (Never mind that many of the trappings<br>
we associate with it preceded Christianity of any form.)  Our social that <br>
year included a performance by a Christian magician who included several<br>
morals into his sleight-of-hand illusions.<br>
<p>
In a private E-mail from Paul Gates that was routed through me, he mentions<br>
that his daughter invited all the kids at a church evangelistic meeting <br>
to come dressed as a Bible character or animal.  (This is an interesting and<br>
fun activity, Halloween or no.)<br>
<p>
There have always been some within the SDA church who condemn Halloween, but<br>
in general SDA's are more likely to come up with a substitute for<br>
something rather than condemn it entirely.  This process is sometimes<br>
referred to <br>
as "vegetarianizing."  This will be another whole post.<br>

About tithe, I understand that tithe is meant to be the _first_ 10% of one's<br>
income. What does this actually mean? Does this mean different things for a<br>
waged employee or a self-employed contractor?<br>
<p>
1) An employee is probably at a disadvantage, because tax and all kinds of<br>
deductions have already been taken from his wages. How can he take the first<br>
10% to give as tithe when some has already been taken? Should tithe be<br>
calculated from gross wages or net wages? If gross, should he just accept<br>
that he has been overtaxed and overdeducted because tithe was not taken into<br>
consideration at the wage office? If net, how does he justify that government<br>
and other human institutions get priority over G*D.<br>
<p>
2) A contractor has the advantage that he can decide himself whether to play<br>
it safe with the worldly authorities, or whether to stand up for truth and<br>
right and regularly take the gross profits or income (which one?) and tithe<br>
them before dealing with the taxes and deductions based on the 90% remainder.<br>
If it was profits, there is the dilemma of which expenses should be classified<br>
as essential and deducted before tithe, and the whole ethical question of how<br>
any expense can have as high a priority. If it was income, then there is the<br>
problem that tithe has become like a tax on turnover, so there is a 10% loss<br>
on items bought and sold at cost (or for whatever reason just passing through).<br>
How can these opposing interests be reconciled?<br>

<p>
As a non-SDA (I'm a member of the Worldwide Church of God) I am genuinely<br>
surprised at this approach the SDA church takes towards Halloween (not to<br>
mention other things which were discussed earlier: Easter and Christmas).<br>
<p>
Though it is not for me to tell you what you ought to be doing, I am<br>
surprised that your approach to things of dubious origins is to "substitute"<br>
rather than to declare such things as "wrong". As I read the Bible, it<br>
seems pretty clear that "light has no fellowship with darkness", and that<br>
Christians are commanded to "come out of [the world]". I will grant you<br>
that we should certainly serve in the world, and extend ourselves by doing<br>
good even as Jesus did, but where are we advised to share in the erroneous<br>
traditions of the world?<br>
<p>
I am surprised that you employ the term "vegetarianizing" to this substitut-<br>
ion process. Though I understand that there are many "meat substitutes"<br>
which vegetarians may enjoy, in its fuller sense, surely vegetarianizing<br>
involves restoring something to the way it once was at creation and getting<br>
rid of those things which are unhealthful (both spiritually and in the<br>
literal sense).<br>
<p>
[Background: my wife and I are recent "converts" to vegetarianism for<br>
health reasons. The WCoG does not teach vegetarianism (and probably many<br>
members would view it as an "aberration"), but it does teach keeping the<br>
health laws given in Leviticus 11 and elsewhere. We choose not to discuss<br>
our vegetarianism with fellow WCoG members in order to "keep the peace".]<br>
<p>
I suppose the bottom line of my surprise is that both the SDA Church and<br>
the WCoG have a number of teachings in common (Sabbath, no immortal soul,<br>
eternal death of the wicked). We both claim the same spiritual lineage<br>
of the apostles, Paulicians, Waldenesians, Bogamils, and early Sabbath<br>
keepers in the US. (Well I think we claim the same - I haven't read much<br>
of the SDA view of history of the true faith.) I have a book "Divine Rest<br>
for Human Restlessness" by a leading SDA scholar and have been impressed<br>
by his insights.<br>
<p>
And yet, when it comes to what I would term "compromising" with the princi-<br>
ples of the Bible (even allowing for the vastly different social and cultural<br>
settings in the Bible compared to the 20th century), to be honest I am<br>
disappointed with the attitudes many seem to hold on SDAnet. Please do not<br>
misunderstand: what the SDA Church teaches and practises is entirely its<br>
business. However, if I was someone initially searching for Truth (as I was<br>
about 15 years ago) I know I would be quite disappointed if this is what the<br>
SDA Church had to offer.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sincere and genuine regards,<br>
<p>
Drew Corrigan.<br>
<p>
PS  Please do not take this as a "my church is better than your church"<br>
    posting - it is not intended as such, and in my opinion any such <br>
    contention is pointless. The WCoG has its warts too.<br>

I will start compiling the digest of SDAnet messages this week.  Messages<br>
starting today and going to the following Sunday will be in the first<br>
issue.  This is primarily concerned with Compuserve readers who are <br>
paying a per-message charge.  A few people have expressed a tentative <br>
interest.  However no one will receive this digest unless they explicitly<br>
request to do so.<br>
<p>
Warning, it won't be pretty.  It will be 30-50 messages stuck from end to end.<br>
<p>
If you want to receive this digest instead of the regular SDAnet, please<br>
send mail explicitly to me.  This is ideal for the person who only reads<br>
about once a week anyway.  By reducing traffic of 100-200 messages to four,<br>
I hope we can alleviate the cost concerns of our Compuserve readers.<br>

Drew has already attacked this practice more eloquently than I can, but<br>
I will share the thoughts I was going to share about it anyway.<br>
<p>
Some of the first "meat analogs" were developed by Dr. J.H. Kellogg<br>
at the Battle Creek Sanitarium.  Later the Battle Creek food company<br>
was taken over by Worthington Foods, which for a time was part of<br>
Miles Laboratories, then bought itself back.  In Adventist colonies,<br>
food stores carry a wide variety of vege-meat.  (Actually, much of it <br>
can even be found in mainstream supermarkets in Pittsburgh today.)  This<br>
has been criticized for being quite artificial and using lots of sodium and<br>
MSG, but the companies are responding to this as well.  Also, long<br>
before decaffeinated teas and colas were in style, Worthington <br>
was putting them out as well.  The point is that <br>
we have a substitute for every (speakable) type of meat there is, including<br>
some substitutes for pork that we theoretically shouldn't even want.<br>
<p>
The practice of vegetarianizing goes well beyond food for SDA's, though.<br>
The holidays are a big example of this.  In this we take practical counsel<br>
from Ellen White, particularly Christmas, where she suggests that a Christmas<br>
tree be erected in churches for the purpose of decorating it with gifts<br>
of money for missions.  In other words, celebrate the holiday, but don't<br>
make <br>
it pagan.  This is in the spirit of Paul's counsel on eating food<br>
offered to idols--we can affirm that the tree is created of God, and use<br>
it for a good purpose despite what others may do.  Halloween has<br>
traditionally been used<br>
by our church school children and Pathfinders as a time of service.<br>
<p>
Other examples include replacing the traditional school "prom" with a <br>
banquet (due to swiftly-falling prohibitions against dancing).  Also <br>
playing Rook instead of Bridge (don't want to get mixed up with cards that<br>
are commonly used for gambling.)  Also rewriting the words of songs that <br>
speak of lifting up of the hands.  <br>
<p>
Though I have been and am currently involved in youth evangelism efforts<br>
which attempt to some extent to compete with the world's entertainment,<br>
I don't think this is the best way.  We don't need to make our church like<br>
the world to make it attractive.  Or:  Why do we think people will come <br>
to the wave pool when the beach is free?<br>
<p>
I'd appreciate others' thoughts on this matter.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; other way around.  As for Halloween, it is probably recognizedby a minority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; SDAs.  First of all, many Adveentists in the U.S. don't let their kids trick or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; treat.  Outside of the U.S., SDAs never celebrate the Day of All Saints with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Catholics.  If nothing else, the mountains of candy ingested are far from kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to the body of little ones.</i><br>

As a child we did NOT celebrate Halloween. It was a purely innocent time<br>
to have a costume party, to go trick-or-treating or Pathfinder food gathering,<br>
and to have a fall festival bob-for-apples type church social.<br>
<p>
In no way was it "celebrated" or the Satanic rituals recognized. Just because<br>
the Devil has corrupted the celebration of the recognition of Christ's<br>
birth and his show of power as resurrected Saviour (wouldn't we expect him<br>
to make negative the positive), does not mean that one is worldly or<br>
Satanic or pagan to recognize the religious holidays and celebrate<br>
them. These are some of the most wonderful family times in our culture<br>
and fond adult memories of "family" trace to the innocent celebration<br>
of these events.<br>
<p>
The sack of candy that we managed to collect was strictly doled out over<br>
a period of months by my mother who never allowed us to gorge. So the<br>
delight of that childhood time stretched till Thanksgiving, the next<br>
special family time. <br>
<p>
With all the darkness and unhappiness and sorrow in this life, it is a<br>
shame we must single out carefully celebrated holidays for criticism<br>
and divisiveness. With all due respect to anyone who does not wish to<br>
observe these holidays, please be tolerant with those who make these times<br>
spiritual, family and other-centered, times of fellowship and giving.<br>
We can major in minors and die of stress-related disease. Life is too<br>
short to get bogged down in some of these petty issues. I've never<br>
known an Adventist yet who uplifted Satanic rituals and dressed their<br>
children in witches costumes. My predominently Adventist neighborhood<br>
is sought after by parents with young children at Halloween time because<br>
they know they can trust this neighborhood's treats as safe. I guess<br>
I've said my piece.<br>

<i>&gt;about 15 years ago) I know I would be quite disappointed if this is what the</i><br>
<i>&gt;SDA Church had to offer.</i><br>
<p>
Thankfully to date Australians have been able to avoid such Americanisms as <br>
Halloween, though I was distressed to find a timid bunch of kids running<br>
around our street last Friday and Saturday nights wearing wierd hats.<br>
<p>
It really does seem to me that accepting such traditions freely (though I am <br>
not familiar with the origin of Halloween) *is* compromising our standards<br>
somewhat. (Though much, it seems, is not by "decree" from the church but <br>
decided largely by the individuals that make up the church.) <br>
<p>
As for Christmas and Easter, I largely speak for myself. Easter has never been<br>
a big deal (no deal at all actually) for me or anyone I know. The only thing<br>
good about easter is there are public holidays at that time, so you get the<br>
chance for a bit of a holiday during the year.<br>
<p>
As I grew up, my family usually celebrated Christmas. Well, no big drama.<br>
Usually a strange sort of Christmas tree cut down from the bush the day before<br>
and decorated with a few bits of tinsel &amp; so forth (nothing like the Christmas<br>
depicted in American movies eg. Home Alone! and anyway - no snow). We didn't <br>
actually make a big deal of the birth of Christ story but did exchange <br>
presents - once again, not of the hugely expensive variety. <br>
<p>
These days I'm sickened by the crass commercialism of Christmas in the shops<br>
at the beginning of October, but that may just be me.<br>
<p>
I don't think of myself as a major spoilsport or wet blanket, and am largely<br>
happy to see other people having a good, clean, fun time. And anyway, isn't<br>
it a bit of a risk these days to let children wander the streets receiving<br>
food? Just think of all the nasty people out there who might spike the food<br>
or steal the kids!?!<br>

The US Presidential campaign will be over in a few hours, and it will <br>
be a few hours more before the 1996 campaign starts.  The moderator<br>
decided to let me post my personal view of the election after all.<br>
I voted for Bill Clinton based on concerns of religious liberty, health<br>
care, the economy, racial harmony and his support for the kind of big<br>
science spending which currently provides me with a job.<br>
<p>
No matter who wins the election, I'm sure SDA conspiracy theorists will <br>
find a way to predict that the time of trouble is at hand during the <br>
upcoming administration.  Sooner or later, one of these times they will <br>
be right.<br>

For better...definitely for better.<br>
<p>
The main thing that upsets me about American politics is the extent to<br>
which things that happen there affect the rest of the world.<br>
<p>
For what it's worth (ie absolutely nothing) I would have voted for Clinton.<br>

No, Avondale College is not connected to AARNET, which is the main<br>
gateway from here onto internet. This may change in the near future,<br>
as recent discussions have taken place regarding the pros and cons<br>
of connecting.<br>

Hower, Ruben, if you wish to communicate with Jorge and Liliana,<br>
I would be happy to pass on any messages. :-&gt;<br>

Steve, <br>
<p>
Any SDA pastor that would like to have the weekly fax from the GC/NAD<br>
faxed them should send their fax number to Monte Sahlin. His fax number is<br>
(301) 680-6464. This will be an experiment with a Pastors' Fax Hotline and<br>
will be conducted later this year. I am sure the pastors having access to<br>
a fax machine would be aware of this but this must be a strictly fax line<br>
without a person answering first. This is no problem of course if you are<br>
using one phone line because there are inexpensive devices that will<br>
sense the call and if it is a fax call will switch it appropriately even<br>
though the person is using only one phone line.<br>

Last Sabbath, in all seriousness, our church's Religious Liberty person<br>
got up and announced that Madalyn Murray O"Hair, the lady who got the<br>
Supreme Court to kick the Bible out of schools in the 60's, was meeting with<br>
the FCC on Nov 10 to get them to remove religious programming from radio.<br>
He then waved several photocopied sheets in the air and suggested we<br>
get a copy, sign the protest, and send it to the FCC.<br>
<p>
I got the impression that our pastor was not surprised (usually he's<br>
pretty with it) so I assume the RL person mentioned he was going to<br>
talk about this.  Anyway, I raised my hand and asked, "How is this<br>
time different from past times which proved to be rumors and false?"<br>
The RL person looked at me blankly and said, "I don't know."<br>
<p>
Unless my memory is failing me, the various union/conference papers and<br>
even the Review (let alone Dear Abby and Ann Landers) have printed stories<br>
indicating that these Madalyn/FCC rumors continue to circulate (how many<br>
years now?) despite attempts to eradicate them.<br>
<p>
Me oh my.  Well, so that I don't become like the boy who cried "Wolf!",<br>
anyone one out there in Rumor Control land know if this is rumor (as I<br>
suspect) or true (finally 8-().<br>

Steve, I saw this earlier today.  I'll leave it to your judgment<br>
whether it should be posted or not.  It is not my intention that<br>
SDAnet should be a gossip column.  But considering Magic's influence<br>
I thought it very interesting that he disclosed this.<br>
<p>
<p>
This morning (Nov 9) on "The Today Show" Magic Johnson said his mother was/is<br>
a Seventh-Day Adventist.  I had heard rumors of this several years ago<br>
but had never had it substantiated, until I heard him say it.  He also<br>
said something about when he was looking for a college to go to, his<br>
family took into consideration when the school played it games, prefer-<br>
ably not on Friday Evenings and Saturday afternoons.  Unfortunatly, I<br>
did not hear much more as I had to leave for work.<br>

[This was quite well-known in Michigan when I was growing up.  Various<br>
people at my academy were from Lansing and said they had played basketball<br>
with his brothers and sisters.  I believe some other of his brothers and <br>
sisters also belong to the church.  SCT]<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
One of my teachers at the university said that she doesn't accept<br>
Christian believes because she can't understand how God could be<br>
love if He demands a sacrifice (see John 3:16).  She finds the idea<br>
that Jesus on the cross would manifest God's love incomprehesible.<br>
<p>
What would you say to this educated woman who does believe in supernatural,<br>
in some "greater power" or "universal love" but not in "our" God ??<br>
I wasn't able to give her a good answer and I'd really like to know <br>
what you would have said!<br>

[Fred Christiansen writes]<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When we had children we determined to find a Godly focus for this time</i><br>
<i>&gt; of year.  What we found was:  Oct 31 was the day Martin Luther nailed</i><br>
<i>&gt; his 95 Theses to the door of the church in Wittenburg.  Some Protestants</i><br>
<i>&gt; refer to this as Reformation Day.  We have found this to be far preferable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Thanks for the reminder Fred.  I'm surprised I let Reformation Day slip<br>
by us this year.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The night before, he [Frederick the Wise] had a "continued story" series of</i><br>
<i>&gt; three dreams.  In them a monk, writings on the door of Wittenburg's church,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Pope's tiara, a large pen reaching to Rome, and the Elector figured</i><br>
<i>&gt; prominently.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh, yes, in the dream, Frederick asked the monk whence came the large pen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The monk answered, "From a goose in Bohemia."  Bonus points if you know</i><br>
<i>&gt; who the goose was and why the symbolism was apt.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I'm not sure of the symbolism, but might the goose in Bohemia<br>
be Jan Hus (John Huss)?  He preceded Frederick and Luther by<br>
about 100 years but was certainly a precursor to the Reformation.<br>
Hus was a martyr (burned as a heretic) for the cause of Christ in<br>
1415.<br>

Received a phone call from one of the new elders at our church.<br>
<p>
He was at church board meeting last night and the topic came up<br>
about married couples foot washing.  Some churches don't do it<br>
at all, some churches offer this option each time.  At our church<br>
its been once a year.  The idea is that the men go one way, the<br>
women go to another set of rooms and one room is set asside for<br>
married couples who wish to choose thier spouce as partner.<br>
<p>
My friend said he had asked if this was something appropriate,<br>
was there any basis for it . . . .  Some members pointed out<br>
that those recently divorced or widowed might feel offended.<br>
A single woman said she would move to another church if it was<br>
to be done regularly.  The church board ended up<br>
delegating him to go off and study the whole thing out.  He asked<br>
me if I had studied the topic, if I chose to study it, could I<br>
pass on to him anything that I came across.  So I'm tossing it<br>
out to you for your input.<br>
<p>
EGW points out that there are no Bible examples of men washing<br>
womens feet.  There is the example of Mary washing Jesus' feet<br>
with her teers.  So, she basically rules out the idea of men<br>
washing womens feet in the context of the Ordinances of Humility,<br>
saying its ok for women to wash a man's feet based on Biblical<br>
precedent.  Is this relevent to the question of husbands &amp; wives?<br>
<p>
I think we have to ask what its all about.  And a story comes<br>
to mind from a mission story book I was reading to my boys several<br>
years ago.  Back in them canibal days the chief would commission<br>
the building of a village war canoe from time to time.  It was<br>
standard practice that several warriors would be selected at<br>
the time of the launching to lay like role logs to expedite<br>
the launching of the canoe.  This had a tendency to do serious<br>
damage, even to kill some of the human skids.  Many years later<br>
we come to the scene at the new church for the first occassion<br>
of foot washing.  One of the members had been seriously mamed<br>
years before.  The chief insisted on washing this former warriors<br>
feet.  He jumped up and was quite adament, that while it might<br>
be ok for him to wash the chiefs feet, that it was not at all<br>
proper for the chief to wash his feet.  In the end the chief was<br>
able to convince him that in Christianity it was indeed the<br>
right thing to do and that in Christ they were all equal anyway.<br>
Quite a moving story.  And illustrative of what Jesus had in<br>
mind when He said -- "This do in remembrance of me?"  And so,<br>
instead of trying to choose a close friend I prefer to choose<br>
an overlooked stranger or somebody who looks like they need<br>
a friend that day, or somebody who . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
Anyway, what does this ordinance mean to you?  From the Bible?<br>
 From EGW?  What about in the context of husband and wife?<br>
An option each time?  Once a year?  Never?<br>
<p>
Thanks for your feedback which I'll pass on to my friend.<br>
<p>

Hi Dave,<br>
<p>
For what its worth ...<br>
<p>
The WCoG practices the ceremony of foot washing once a year during the<br>
Passover service. Men go to one room and women to another. However, in<br>
cases where couples cannot attend the Passover for whatever reason (eg<br>
great distance) we have instructions for them on how to observe it at<br>
home. In this situation, husbands and wives wash each others feet.<br>
<p>
We would not see any problems with this. Christ washes the Church with<br>
the water of the Word, and he is our example of humility and service.<br>
<p>
The foot washing service teaches us not only that we must be genuinely<br>
humble and service minded towards others (and indeed that we rededicate<br>
ourselves to service each Passover) but also that we are prepared to <br>
let ourselves be "washed" by the Great Servant himself - Jesus. When I<br>
wash anothers feet I think of how I must serve and mentally rededicate<br>
myself to that. As I am washed, I mentally ask God to wash me of the <br>
"travel stains" (ie sins) I have acquired since the previous Passover.<br>
<p>

Several observations about washing one another's feet.<br>
<p>
1. What is the underlying motivation and purpose? Humility, right? Feet were filthy in those days and a gracious host made his guest comfortable by washing<br>
feet, dirty feet. A stinky, yucky job. But somebody did it. This principle<br>
of humility rules out the idea that a man could never wash a woman's feet.<br>
We are all one family, brothers and sisters. Why shouldn't we be glad to<br>
make one another more comfortable? This is not a sexual act. <br>
<p>
2. Having written the last sentence, I can remember not too long ago<br>
when women did not wear panty hose, but stockings which clipped onto<br>
very private underwear. They removed these stockings for footwashing<br>
and it was considered modest for men and women to be separated. Some<br>
older women still wear these stockings and the woman who is uncomfortable<br>
may be in this situation. <br>
<p>
3. When I was in college, the older women were appalled that we college<br>
girls would wear those new panty hose and not remove them for footwashing.<br>
It probably seemed un-humble (?), brash, hurried and just downright<br>
untraditional. I remember hearing loud carrying on about it during the<br>
footwashing, sort of wrecking any reflections about the ordinance.<br>
<p>
4. If you really want to know what humility is all about, go to the<br>
library and find Richard Selzer's book, "Letters to a Young Surgeon."<br>
Read the chapter entitled "Toenails." This is a powerful true story<br>
about a physician engaged in an ordinance of humility of clipping the<br>
long, curling under toenails of the homeless people who live in<br>
the public library during cold winters. When I heard James Dobson read<br>
this story on his radio program one day, I drove right to the public<br>
library, checked out the book, made copies and read the story to all<br>
my family. I agree with Dobson. It makes the ordinance of humility<br>
get some perspective. <br>
<p>
5. If you cannot find the above book, I'll be glad to mail anyone a<br>
copy of this short story. E-mail me at PHARRIS@UTKVX.UTK.EDU with your<br>
snail-mail address. <br>
<p>
6. I'm wary of anyone who threatens to go to another church should the<br>
church try something new. On the other hand, being sensitive to others<br>
is what Christianity is all about. Surely there is middle ground here.<br>

Hmmm, I've never thought about it outside of it just being a "thing".<br>
The identity of the individual who's feet we wash doesn't seem critical<br>
for salvation.  Ideally, it would change every time.  Let married people<br>
wash each other's feet, let friends, let strangers.  The focus should be<br>
in humbling ourselves to be servants to our spouses, children, elders<br>
strangers, and yes, even our enemies.<br>
<p>
Glad you asked the question though.  It made me thing.<br>

In backwoods northern Michigan, our church tried the idea of husbands<br>
and wives being able to wash each other's feet once.  My folks enjoyed<br>
the <br>
procedure and thought it was a neat idea, and there doesn't seem to have<br>
been much hue and cry about it.  In other churches where I currently <br>
attend, it's clear the process would cause enough problems that even<br>
mentioning doing it would be unspeakable.  I have also heard of places<br>
where there are small rooms where a whole family may be together <br>
for the foot-washing.<br>
<p>
In footwashing, we follow the Lord's command and example by washing the <br>
feet of others, and we show our humility not by washing, but by <br>
allowing our feet to be washed.<br>
<p>
I think also that it is dangerous to argue from silence in the Bible,<br>
just saying that since it was never recorded that a man washed a woman's<br>
feet, it should never be done.<br>

Ellen White has given us the assurance that the Church will go through.<br>
We need to be careful in how we interpret this.<br>
<p>
* Consider that Jesus made a similar prophecy that His church would go<br>
  through and not even Hades would prevail against it.  The RCC has<br>
  taken ahold of this scripture and made the the keys in Peter's hands.<br>
  They claim to be the church that will go through, but we know that it<br>
  was the church driven into the wilderness that survives the Apostles.<br>
<p>
* Think of it as a Covenant that God has made, through His prophet EGW.<br>
  A covenant that this last day church will go through.  At Sinaii God<br>
  covenanted that he would place His law within their hearts.  But they<br>
  insisted on taking things into their own hands and so Israel turned<br>
  God's covenant into the "Old Covenant".  The Covenant was re-instated<br>
  in the New Covenant.  Paul illustrates this Old/New Covenant problem<br>
  with the story of Ishmael and Isaac.  It was not God's covenant that<br>
  was faulty, simply that Ishamael was the son of Abraham's lack of<br>
  faith and Isaac was the son of promise, the result of the selfsame<br>
  promise on God's part.<br>
<p>
Consider Ellen White's warning that our church would do much as Judaism<br>
did at the time when Jesus arrived on the scene.  There is much we can<br>
learn in order not to repeat their mistakes.<br>

<i>&gt; In footwashing, we follow the Lord's command and example by washing the </i><br>
<i>&gt; feet of others, and we show our humility not by washing, but by </i><br>
<i>&gt; allowing our feet to be washed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve Timm</i><br>

<p>
You seem to have a strange concept of humility.  Let us set the<br>
stage.  In the normal situation, the aristocrat is getting his<br>
feet washed, and the slave is the one doing the washing.  To <br>
wash someone's feet is to assume the position of a slave and to<br>
honor the person whose feet are washed.<br>
<p>
Those who recognize Jesus as the Christ are naturally taken back<br>
by his role as a servant.  Notice John the Baptist's response<br>
when Jesus came forward for a water baptism unto repentance.<br>
Peter's response was similar when Jesus wanted to wash his feet.<br>
Those who recognize Jesus as the Christ also hear his voice and<br>
follow his intruction.  John did baptise Jesus; Peter did have<br>
his feet washed.<br>

Hi friends, thanks for your postings on the topic.<br>
<p>
One question I forgot to ask, does anybody know any of the history<br>
of foot washing.  I know of not text in the Bible that would suggest<br>
the disciples took up the practice in the context of early Christianity.<br>
Of course foot washing was an ongoing thing in the context of their<br>
dusty setting where people did a lot of walking on dusty roads.<br>
Anything in the "early fathers"?  What about Luther and other<br>
reformers.  What is the earliest indication of foot washing?<br>
<p>
Could somebody volunteer to do some historical research?<br>
<p>
I have heard that during early SDA church history the churches that did<br>
foot washing did it mixed and some of the men used to get all charged up<br>
on picking out a young maiden for a partner so as to remove her stockings<br>
and wash her feet.  I don't see that as a problem in the husband/wife<br>
context.  But if this is real history, then I can understand why<br>
it came time to separate the men to one room and the women to another.<br>
<p>
Does anyone know what churches other than SDA and WWCoG do foot washing,<br>
historically and today?  Baptists?  Seventh Day Baptists, Etc.  As far<br>
as I know the RCC does not and never did.  But hey, I don't know that.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
DaveB<br>
<p>
[In fact the Pope every year on Maundy Thursday washes the feet of <br>
twelve selected people as a re-enactment of the first footwashing.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt; One of my teachers at the university said that she doesn't accept</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christian believes because she can't understand how God could ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What would you say to this educated woman who does believe in supernatural,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in some "greater power" or "universal love" but not in "our" God ??</i><br>
<i>&gt; I wasn't able to give her a good answer and I'd really like to know </i><br>
<i>&gt; what you would have said!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Minna</i><br>
---------<br>
Hello Minna,<br>
<p>
When one is trying to respond to another's dilemma, the best<br>
approach is to discover the root problem.  Above, I deleted<br>
your teacher's specific point because that is not the problem.<br>
The first two lines give us the root problem.  Her problem is<br>
that she will not accept a God she cannot understand.  She will<br>
believe only if she is allowed to define God.<br>
<p>
What would I say to this educated woman?  Hear the words of<br>
Paul from I Corinthians:<br>
<p>
  17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the<br>
gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ<br>
should be made of none effect.<br>
  18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish<br>
foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of<br>
God.<br>
<p>
  21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom<br>
knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to<br>
save them that believe.<br>
  22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after<br>
wisdom:<br>
  23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a<br>
stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;<br>
  24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks,<br>
Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.<br>
<p>
She needs to hear the word of God and pray that he would open<br>
her understanding to its truth, which is a spiritual revelation.<br>
You keep preaching the crucified Lamb of God.  Personally, I<br>
find reading about the sacrifices in the Old Testament (Genesis<br>
and Exodus) very rewarding.<br>
<p>
May God bless your labors,<br>
<p>
Dan Blake<br>

Dave repeats some timely warnings about the possibility of the church <br>
going through.  I think we can trace back the theology that endangers <br>
churches, and it's theology that is not unheard of in SDA churches:<br>
<p>
The Catholic view in ancient times and today is that the church is the<br>
prime if not only dispenser of God's grace, which is conveyed through<br>
sacraments. (Baptism, Marriage, Absolution, Ordination, etc.)<br>
With the notion that such a group has a monopoly on God, it follows<br>
that they will never think they are wrong.<br>
<p>
Other churches which follow this lead will find their organizations <br>
also becoming like this.  A ministry turns into a priesthood.  <br>
Appeals to reason are replaced with appeals to "traditional Adventism"<br>
whatever that may be.  ("Adventism" itself is a word I would like to <br>
excise from the language.  We do not refer to the religion of Baptists<br>
as "Baptism", do we?)  <br>
<p>
The trend in SDA leadership recently is away from the imperialistic <br>
attitude, and this is good.  But it will take more than enlightened <br>
leadership for the survival and growth of the church.  It will take<br>
a people who are servants of God and of each other, not people who <br>
play "dodgeball" with the inspired writings.<br>
<p>

Go through what? Persecution? The Tribulation? Through to the return of<br>
Jesus?<br>

The washing of feet was practiced regularly in the 1830s-1840s by various<br>
Baptist sects--the Original Free-Will Baptists, Six-Principles Baptists,<br>
Seventh-Day Baptists, United Baptists, and Dunkers.  In fact, Joseph Smith,<br>
the prophet of Mormon Church also instituted a footwashing ceremony in 1836<br>
at the time of the dedication of the first Mormon Temple in Kirtland, Ohio.<br>
Footwashing was also practiced in the Mormon "School of the Prophets" which<br>
was started in 1832.  When the first 12 apostles of the LDS Church were<br>
called, the President of the Church, Joseph Smith, wash the feet of these<br>
twelve men in 1835.  Footwashing is now part of the endowment ceremonies<br>
performed in modern LDS Temples.<br>
<p>
Seventh-Day Adventists obviously "inherited" or "borrowed" this ceremony<br>
from the Baptists who were already doing this even before 1844.<br>

The trend in SDA leadership recently is away from the imperialistic<br>
attitude, and this is good.  But it will take more than enlightened<br>
leadership for the survival and growth of the church.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It will take a people who are servants of God and of each other, not </i><br>
people who<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;play _"dodgeball"_ with the inspired writings.</i><br>

<i>&gt;[In fact the Pope every year on Maundy Thursday washes the feet of </i><br>

<p>
I attended (was paid to sing at) the Maundy Thursday (beginning of Easter<br>
weekend) service at a nearby Catholic church this past spring.  I gathered<br>
that it is the tradition at such services for the officiating priest to<br>
wash the feet of 12 men (no women or children) representative of the<br>
congregation.<br>

I am a lifetime SDA.  I stopped participating in footwashing regularly<br>
several years ago.  The reason for me is that it appears to be a meaning-<br>
less tradition.  A large percentage of the individuals participating<br>
are just going through the motions.  They wash the feet while talking<br>
about all sorts of secular activities.  I've found that staying in the<br>
sanctuary, listening to the music, reading my bible and meditating on<br>
the word of God much more spiritually uplifting.<br>
<p>
I've enjoyed the comments on footwashing.  The views some have expressed<br>
regarding reasons for footwashing have been refreshing.  I look forward<br>
to seeing some more.<br>

Maybe not, but it does refer to one of their beliefs/practices just as<br>
adventism refers to one of ours.  <br>
<p>
Also, we have Catholicism, Anglicanism, Episcopalianism, Methodism, and<br>
even Atheism and Paganism.  So I don't think the word can be ruled out<br>
on purely etymological grounds.<br>

I assume that Steve's point is that, at least in current usage,<br>
adventism != Adventism.  You choose which you wish to be (either, both,<br>
or, if it pleases you, neither).<br>

We now return to the regularly scheduled programme.<br>

I am unsure if this is related to what Steve was talking about, but my<br>
fear is that we will become stagnate in some sense.  What I mean by this<br>
is that we don't have any fresh looks at the old fundamentals, but just a<br>
constant rehashing.  I find it is good sometimes to question oneself to<br>
see that the path taken has been the correct one.  After being an<br>
Adventist for abou a year I began to become more questioning in regards to<br>
the evidences for certain belief the Church holds.  It was in some sense<br>
my time to really start being a good Berean.  At times I was disappointed<br>
when I took another look at passages that had been brought up almost in a<br>
proof text fashion to support certain views, but at the same time the<br>
texts that were not disappointing and other texts I found supported the<br>
general belief.  Other items I am still struggling with and I hope that<br>
through further reflection and study a solution might be found.  My<br>
problems are mostly in the area of interpretations of Revelation (which is<br>
ironic since that is what got me to go to meetings conducted by the church<br>
in the first place).  I guess my point is that we should not be afraid to<br>
question things as long as we are humbly submissive to God and willing to<br>
learn the truth.<br>

(To the SDA Net)<br>
Good evening Steve,<br>
<p>
I down loaded your first SDA NET digest and just finished reading it.<br>
There seemed to be quite a few comments on feet washing/Communion Service.<br>
<p>
I see no problem with spouses washing each other's feet as a part of the<br>
communion service. I suppose there could be a problem with singles not<br>
liking the idea but wherever I participated in this type of a service<br>
there was also provision for women/women and men/men.<br>
<p>
On the Sabbath's that we conduct the service I speak for only 10-15<br>
minutes and before we separate for the feet/washing part I instruct the<br>
congregation about the service, etc. no secular talking and recommend that<br>
the person have a prayer for the one they are serving. No one mentioned it<br>
but as Adventists we believe in open communion which simply means<br>
christians of any faith may join in with us if they so desire.<br>
<p>
After church on that Sabbath of Communion, the elders and I decide who<br>
will take communion to members that were absent that day.<br>
<p>
On another subject: I agree that just because the Bible is silent on an<br>
issue, that is no criteria for support or non-support. If we wanted to<br>
make something out of that, it would seem to indicate that it was not a<br>
problem in Bible times.<br>
<p>
Does anyone know anything about this organization in Angwin, CA that puts<br>
out these video tapes. I have seen some of the tapes and it seems to<br>
"smack" of Hartland Institute which as you all know is located in Va. This<br>
organization calls themselves LL? productions or some similar thing like<br>
that.<br>
<p>
Since I voted for Clinton, I was pleased that he won the election. I could<br>
be wrong but I think we are going to see some good things happen with the<br>
new administration.<br>
<p>
That's all for now.<br>
<p>
...........Paul<br>

Hermeneutics is a big word.  It is also a big topic.  And, to some extent a<br>
misunderstood concept.  Basically it means translating an idea across time and<br>
space.  Hence, what we have to do with the Bible any time we read it.<br>
<p>
I'm working on a project on hermeneutics as practiced by lay people.  In <br>
simple words, I want to know what kind of rules or parameters people apply to<br>
their Bible study when they really want to find out something.<br>
<p>
Please let me know what "rules" for Bible investigation you think are most<br>
important.  I'm not giving examples, since I don't want to prejudice anyone. <br>
<p>
I'd like to hear from any and all.  Obviously, there will be different<br>
approaches.  Different people will ask different questions of the text.<br>
<p>
Thanks for your help.<br>
<p>
Nancy<br>

Recently I was asked to answer a question on the symbolism of footwashing--<br>
was it a mini-baptism or a symbol of humility.  I found the material in<br>
the chapter "Servant of Servants" in Desire of Ages to be most illuminating.<br>
<p>
I think we as individuals have the chance to foster change.  We may not change<br>
everyone, but my partner and I can talk of the right things, pray together, and<br>
enjoy the blessings of footwashing.  Perhaps others may copy what they see.<br>
<p>
Let change start with me!!<br>
<p>

The words of "Malachi Robertson"  (Ian R. Brown)<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I guess one of the important rules that I hold in Bible study is the rule</i><br>
<i>&gt; of checking out the context.  A lot of times I find this is not done, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead a passage is taken out of context.  Now by context I mean the word</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a broad sense:  there is the immediate writen context of the passage</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the verses near the  verses in question and of the BIble as a whole;</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is also historical context ; and one I guess might also include</i><br>
<i>&gt; language context, that is what did certain words mean and how were they</i><br>
<i>&gt; used.  After one has down the meaning of one passage or weveral passages,,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tthen I supppose comes what I call the 'So What?' rule, where one must ask</i><br>
<i>&gt; how the meaning of these passages impacts our life or at least applies to</i><br>
<i>&gt; our life.  I guess maybe the last rule may not always be applicacable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

In recent years I have tried in interpretation of the Bible to discard<br>
as many external postulates as I can.  My first rule would be:<br>
<p>
1)  Don't claim for the Bible what it doesn't claim for itself.<br>
2)  Areas in which it does claim inspiration "Doctrine, Reproof,<br>
Correction, and instruction in righteousness" should be our major goals<br>
for using the Bible.  But even this claim should not be taken at face<br>
value--rather we have the opportunity to *prove* that this claim is <br>
true by applying the Bible to our lives in the ways described above.<br>
<p>
3)  Ignore extrabiblical concepts which either limit (God can't force...)<br>
or overextend the reach of God.  <br>
<p>
4)  View apparent contradictions as potential paradoxes to be resolved,<br>
resulting in a deeper understanding, but don't be upset when one can't<br>
be resolved directly.<br>
<p>
5)  Realize that the Bible is infallible, but not necessarily my<br>
interpretation of it.<br>
<p>
6)  If apparent conflicts develop between the Bible and science, realize<br>
that we have much more to learn about both and keep an open mind.<br>

Here is Cheryl's list of hermeneutical rules:<br>
1. Ask for guidance from the Holy Spirit.<br>
2. Don't be afraid to challenge what you've been taught in the past.<br>
3. Try to understand the context of what is being said and then figure out<br>
   whether this is an "eternal truth" or something for that time and place.<br>
4. Don't accept a solitary verse as the basis for a belief.  Rather use all<br>
   of Scripture and adopt a global view.<br>
5. Try to be consistent.  If you adopt a literal interpretation in one <br>
   instance, don't use a symbolic view of related verses.<br>
6. Use the original Greek or Hebrew words to link related uses of these<br>
   words rather than accepting the English words as being the same.<br>
7. The Holy Bible is not the literal word of God.  So look for the principles<br>
   being applied but don't expect perfect agreement even for the same author.<br>
8. Don't discount a verse or scripture just because there are no collaborative<br>
   of supportive scripture.  A single verse conveying an idea or doctrine is<br>
   certainly possible.<br>
9. Take great care in interpreting prophecies.  Don't rely on past interpreta-<br>
   tions.  Don't force a literal interpretation on verses that appear to be<br>
   symbolic.<br>
10.Be careful of contamination by personal motives.  For example, if I want to<br>
   go skiing on Sabbath I might rationalize "doing thine own pleasure" as<br>
   business dealings only.<br>
<p>
I'd like to hear reactions.<br>

<p>
OK, here is the way I like to approach Bible study :       <br>
<p>
  1- Determine the author  ( I usually use the SDA Bible Commentary )<br>
  <br>
  2- Determine the audience ( SDA Bible Commentary, again )<br>
 <br>
  3- Become familiar with the historical setting<br>
  <br>
  4- Try to understand the issues addressed in the passage<br>
<p>
  5- Try to discover the principle(s) applied<br>
<p>
  6- Refer to other passages on the same topic<br>
<p>
  7- Read the relevant Spirit of Prophecy references<br>
<p>
  8- Look for confirmation of interpretation from other Christians<br>
<p>
  9- Use several Bible versions       <br>
<p>
 10- Pray for the Holy Spirit's guidence (MOST IMPORTANT)<br>
<p>
<p>
The above list is not exhaustive by any means, and are most likely not in<br>
the correct sequence.  I'll be waiting for other posts, knowing I'll be able<br>
to add to my list.<br>

Thanks for the postings on hermeneutics.  A question for all:<br>
Do you think the principles and procedures of hermeneutics need to be<br>
taught to lay persons?  <br>
Can we expect all church members to "interpret" scripture accurately?<br>
<p>

So far I have 10 hams on SDAnet.  I've started a listing with email addresses,<br>
class codes, and a status code indicating level of activity.  If the information<br>
I have on you is incomplete or incorrect, please send me a message.<br>

Well, I've seen a number of acquaintances of mine who have gone off<br>
the deep end on Biblical prophecy.  One of them convinced himself that<br>
the world would end in 1992 due to the "jubilee of jubilees" occurring<br>
then.<br>
<p>
Graham Maxwell has told the story of the Loma Linda dentist who, when<br>
Maxwell tried to make an appointment a few months ahead on some<br>
business matter, informed him that this could not be done because by<br>
then the dentist would no longer be on the earth (he would be raptured<br>
or something).<br>
<p>
I think many people would be better off simply practicing<br>
nuts-and-bolts Christianity and staying completely out of theology.<br>

<p>
That may be so but isn't that precisely what the Catholic Church <br>
attempted in the dark ages? The result: the Church is not kept accountable.<br>
<p>
It is also the beauty of the SDA church, that the individual is considered <br>
intelligent enough to explore the Bible for themselves. The remarkable thing <br>
is that, in the first place, our beliefs were not developed by especially <br>
educated people.<br>

Last night I wathced the program 48 Hours on CBS (a news special program in the<br>
U.S.)<br>
<p>
The topic was pornography.  The program seemed interesting and informative, at least<br>
the part I had the opportunity to watch.<br>
<p>
However, what really caugth my attention was a interview they conducted to a<br>
pronographyic movie actress.  She was an African American from Fresno, California and<br>
they said she had been raised in a Seventh Day Adventist Church.  They interviewed<br>
also her mother (who chose not to be shown in film). <br>
<p>
The actress said she did not want to do those types of movies for more than<br>
1 year and her goal was to become a 'real' movie director.<br>
<p>
She says that nobody would have thought she'd end up doing that, nor even herself.<br>
<p>
It's is rather uncomforting to hear those types of references to the church, I think.<br>
<p>
Well, that's my contribution, just a thought.<br>

I heartily agree for the most part except for the "completely".  I<br>
think I need a little theology to understand the nut's and bolts<br>

I am troubled by when people suggest that we shouldn't worry about <br>
theology and just concentrate on day-to-day Christianity.<br>
It seems to me that hermeneutics (which is a ten-dollar word for <br>
how one interprets the Bible) is closely tied in with everyday life.<br>
So, for that matter, should be all other aspects of whatever theology<br>
and doctrine we have.<br>
<p>
What we believe is important, especially for Seventh-day Adventists, because<br>
often that is the only thing we as Adventists have in common.  In particular<br>
since the subculture has disintegrated, the common ground in doctrine stands<br>
alone instead of alongside common ground in behavior.  The doctrinal <br>
pillars of our church can and must be used to build interpersonal unity<br>
and consensus in other areas of church life.<br>
<p>
Without the Advent message, the Adventist church would have no common <br>
purpose to exist.  Those who suppose that the distinctive doctrines of <br>
Adventism can somehow be separated from "basic Christianity" or<br>
"personal relationship with God" are mistaken.  All our doctrine and<br>
theology<br>
should lead us to a better relationship with God and our fellow man.<br>
We have a ways to go to prove that they in fact do--this is why we have<br>
not yet seen the world beating a path to our door.  But I am convinced<br>
that they can.  If someone feels that there is one of the 27 fundamental <br>
beliefs which does not directly help relationship to God or man, I encourage<br>
them to explain on the net why they think this is so.<br>
<p>

Paul Harvey News today reported that CofE (Church of England) adherents<br>
who object to the CofE decision to permit women priests are being encouraged<br>
by the Bishop of London to break away from CofE and form a new church under<br>
the Pope.  Interesting ...<br>

Is this to say that Pastors are SMART and can handle predictions gone wrong;<br>
Lay people are DUMB and would be shattered by advent predictions gone wrong?<br>

I may be putting words into Glen's mouth but methinks his comments<br>
about theology may come from experiences with theologians .. you know,<br>
the academicians that teach Bible and Theology classes at colleges and<br>
seminaries.<br>
<p>
I attended Andrews Univeristy and Seminaire Adventiste du Saleve.  I had<br>
some good teachers, some questionable; some who brooked no discussion<br>
on interpretation and those who seemed swayed by "higher criticism" perhaps.<br>
For example, was it really the Red Sea that the children of Israel<br>
crossed or was Yam Suph (Sea of Reeds) just one of the Bitter Lakes?<br>
Yet again, Moses' history of Creation week may be "too simplistic".<br>
<p>
 From my experience, theologians run the risk of their Christianity<br>
becoming pedestrian, work-a-day, or on the other hand, esoteric (Acts 26:24b).<br>
They can become too full of themselves, of their own erudition (Pro 21:2),<br>
or too accepting of their peers and professors.  For example, most<br>
SDA theologians got their PhDs from non-SDA schools.  There have been<br>
problems with strange beliefs creeping in (e.g., Brinsmead, Desmond Ford).<br>
Mind you, it only takes a couple like this to give the whole crew a bad rap,<br>
to make common folk wary.<br>
<p>
A contemporary example, IMHO, is a recent Pacific Union Recorder where<br>
two theologians/ethicists from LaSierra, I believe, gave opinions pro/con on<br>
California's Right-to-Die proposition.  Two things concerned me here:<br>
1) The con opinion was really a pro opinion but recommending con for<br>
now, "let's wait and see how things turn out in Holland".  2) Both made<br>
vague references to Adventist tradition, views on human life, but totally<br>
without any Scripture references (or, gasp!, EGW quotes).  So help me!<br>
Have they really abandoned Scripture as having anything relevant to say?<br>
<p>
Theologian/teacher or layfolk, but especially them because of the role they<br>
have, need to understand the importance of a humble and teachable spirit<br>
and a servant's heart:<br>
  PSA 25:9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach<br>
    his way.<br>
  JOH 3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease.<br>
  JAM 4:6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the<br>
    proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.  (also 1 Pet 5:5,6)<br>
  PHI 2:8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself [..]<br>
  MAT 23:11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.<br>
  JOH 12:26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there<br>
    shall also my servant be: IF ANY MAN SERVE ME, HIM WILL MY FATHER HONOUR.<br>
  GAL 1:10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?<br>
    for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.<br>
<p>
Moses was mighty in Spirit because of his attitude:<br>
  EXO 33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,<br>
    SHEW ME NOW THY WAY, THAT I MAY KNOW THEE, that I may find grace in thy<br>
    sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.  (emph suppl)<br>
  EXO 33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give<br>
    thee rest.<br>
<p>
Solomon was blessed at Gibeon because of his attitude:<br>
  1 KI 3:7 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of<br>
    David my father: and I AM BUT A LITTLE CHILD: I KNOW NOT HOW TO GO OUT OR<br>
    COME IN.<br>
  1 KI 3:9 GIVE THEREFORE THY SERVANT AN UNDERSTANDING HEART to judge thy<br>
    people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge<br>
    this thy so great a people?<br>
  1 KI 3:10 And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.<br>
<p>
Too often we approach Bible study just wanting knowledge for an assignment<br>
or to rebut someone on SDAnet 8-) or whatever.  I found these passages<br>
instructive:<br>
  EXO 31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in<br>
    understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,<br>
Notice that being mighty in Spirit, obtaining Godly wisdom, and<br>
understanding God's perspective come before knowledge and applied skill.<br>
There is another instructive passage on Christian growth:<br>
  2 PE 1:5-8 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue;<br>
    and to virtue knowledge; And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance<br>
    patience; and to patience godliness; And to godliness brotherly kindness;<br>
    and to brotherly kindness charity .  For if these things be in you, and<br>
    abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in<br>
    the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<p>
Peace to you all in the Lord.<br>

Please forgive my spelling if I happened to mess up on that subject line.<br>
<p>
In reaction to Cheryl's rules of interpretation, I will first of all say<br>
that most of them I can generally agree with.  I have some problems<br>
though. With number 2 on questioning past teaching, I feel there is a<br>
right and wrong way on this.  You can do it humbly or arrogantly.  I guess<br>
that is just a qualification I would add.  With number 5 on consistency, I<br>
should have mentioned that myself.  If I had I would have added that<br>
sometimes inconsistencies are only on the surface and that there is some<br>
justification for the apparent inconsistency.  For example, I see a<br>
justified one in saying the woman was clothed with the sun and the sun<br>
being a symbol of the Light of God, while later when John says of the<br>
heavenly city, it had no sun, to say that that should mean the literal<br>
sun.  As for number 7 on the literal word of God, I am usure what is meant<br>
by the literal word of God and I am not comfortable with the statement<br>
about the authors.  With number 9, one should be cautious in not relying<br>
on past interpretations.  Sure let them be scrutinzed, but don't throw<br>
them out the window right off from the start.  I guess my probems are more<br>
qualifications I would make and a question or two.<br>

As an outsider looking in, what were the things that SDAs once had in common<br>
as their "subculture"? When and why did it disintegrate?<br>

Since this quarter's Sabbath School lessons are on Song of Solomon (Song of<br>
Songs), I'm looking for various opinions as to what this book of the Bible<br>
means.  I'm particularly interested in what you think this book's message<br>
is portraying.  Is it "love poetry?"  Does it represent Christ' love for<br>
the church?  Something else?<br>
<p>
While discussing this with some friends recently, I became aware that I<br>
could think of no place in the Bible where there are more words attributed<br>
to one woman than in this book.  I haven't checked out Ruth and Esther<br>
recently but I don't recall that they are quoted very much.  I suppose this<br>
may be considered trivial if you don't think of the Shulamite in Song of<br>
Solomon as being a literal person, but as a character in a story,  However,<br>
I still thought this "trivia" was interesting.<br>

<i>&gt;I may be putting words into Glen's mouth but methinks his comments</i><br>
<i>&gt;about theology may come from experiences with theologians ...</i><br>
<p>
<i> &gt;From my experience, theologians run the risk of their Christianity</i><br>
<i>&gt;becoming pedestrian, work-a-day, or on the other hand, esoteric (Acts 26:24b).</i><br>
<i>&gt;They can become too full of themselves, of their own erudition (Pro 21:2),</i><br>
<i>&gt;or too accepting of their peers and professors...</i><br>
<p>
Our judgement of certain groups of people is always coloured by those of that<br>
category that we have had dealings with. It was with this in mind that I<br>
noticed the above comments with interest. I don't know who it was that Glen<br>
thought should be having less theology and more Christianity but from my<br>
experience I wouldn't have thought of the theologians. I lived at Avondale<br>
College for 6 years while growing up, then for 4 years while doing a teaching<br>
degree, thus completing a number of Bible subjects. I have a great respect <br>
for those theologians in whose classes I sat. They seemed to be able to make<br>
the Bible come alive, put things into proper perspectives, present varying<br>
points of view. I didn't think of theology as being a dangerous or over-used<br>
thing in their hands.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, those non-theologians who may be retired, may be ex-<br>
evangelists, or who may on the other hand be preferring "lawlessness" seem to<br>
me to be the dangerous ones. It is these fringe-dwellers or trouble-makers I<br>
would have considered theology to be a deadly tool for rather than the<br>
theologians. But I would still have to defend their right to the Bible and <br>
even their right to deceive people as they do, though I'd rather they not<br>
do it.<br>
<p>
So that was the picture I saw anyway!<br>

<i>&gt;As an outsider looking in, what were the things that SDAs once had in common</i><br>
<i>&gt;as their "subculture"? When and why did it disintegrate?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Thanks,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Drew.</i><br>
<p>
There are some on this net who would not agree with me that the subculture<br>
has disintegrated.  I would say that the most drastic changes happened in <br>
the 70's to and through the early 80's.  It was in the 70's that the<br>
people of the righteousness-by-faith message started really being heard.<br>
Unfortunately the message was misunderstood, leading to people accepting<br>
the easy part about salvation by faith but ignoring the part about <br>
salvation from sin.  When people started hearing that salvation was by <br>
faith alone, many were (and still are) unable to comprehend why the <br>
various components of the Adventist lifestyle should be practiced at all.<br>
<p>
The changes have included liberalization in forms of entertainment,<br>
diet, and dress.  From time to time all these issues are discussed here<br>
at length.  I refer to the death of the subculture not because of these<br>
changes, but because what happens at the church's institutions is becoming<br>
increasingly more irrelevant to the local churches that are far away <br>
from them.  <br>

We discussed a few weeks ago about problems with guests at our church<br>
who may not know how to behave just right or dress neatly or bathe regularly.<br>
No real consensus came of that.  Now we have a crisis with one of these<br>
people that is coming to a head in our church.<br>
<p>
"Joe" has visited our church semi-regularly for four years at least.  <br>
Often he arrives late, only in time for pot luck.  When he does come in <br>
time for church, he will sit in the back, not in the main sanctuary.<br>
He's very self-conscious about personal cleanliness but that doesn't mean<br>
he is always cleaned up.  He has been homeless for most of this time. <br>
He is essentially harmless and wouldn't hurt a fly.<br>
<p>
Evidently in the period in which I was gone from Pittsburgh, and still<br>
continuing now, there have been some problems mostly concerning the<br>
almost<br>
compulsive and lengthy routine he goes through in the church's restroom.<br>
People of authority in the church have been speaking recently about asking<br>
him to leave and never come back, and when I heard their side of the story<br>
I had to admit that there is really a problem which does need to be<br>
addressed.  Knowing "Joe's" track record it's unlikely that he could<br>
change<br>
his behavior enough to reassure the large number of people who are<br>
uncomfortable with his presence for a number of good reasons.<br>
<p>
Even with the clear-cut evidence in this case, it still makes me<br>
uncomfortable to hear the attitudes of those proposing his dismissal.<br>
Are we setting a precedent by throwing out those who don't fit?  Will<br>
this enhance the spirit of classism already prevalent in this church?<br>
Who will be next?  Is the throwing out of the homeless the price we must<br>
pay to make our stated targed group, yuppies and baby boomers, comfortable?<br>
Will Joe be willing to leave Abraham's bosom to drop water on our tongues<br>
when the fire gets hot?  (Echoes of the parable of the rich man and Lazarus).<br>
<p>
Not so long ago at this very church, people of color were shown the door<br>
and given the address to the local Black church.  The reason used was<br>
identically the same--some people would be uncomfortable with them there.<br>
Those people who were uncomfortable with Black people are still with us, <br>
and still uncomfortable, yet they haven't left the church, and the church <br>
hasn't split apart.  Are the homeless the next group that we must learn to<br>
tolerate?  Will it hurt the yuppies to learn to tolerate them any more than <br>
it hurt the rednecks of a generation ago to tolerate integration?  And, as a<br>
city church, can we afford to ignore an important sector of the population?<br>

The Reformation is lost if hermenutics is not taught to "lay" members.<br>
Since I don't think we have the Catholic approach to scriptural<br>
interpretation (some may disagree!) then the logical extension is that we<br>
*must* teach hermenutics to as many "lay" members as possible.  The wild<br>
ideas circulated by many fringe religious groups are often the result of<br>
narrow, confused, and uninformed application of scripture. <br>
I think many leaders are afraid of "lay" members asking too many<br>
questions. (And aren't we back to the Reformation?!)<br>
A broadened perspective and deeper understanding of the bible and its<br>
context in culture, history, and language can only help to expand our<br>
understanding and proclimation of scriptural truth.  The tools to do this<br>
cannot, must not be kept by the few.<br>

To Steve Timm &amp; the Net:<br>
<p>
I was just wondering if any of the "Hams" on the net are on Packet Radio?<br>
A "Node" was just put on the air about 3 blocks from my house so it is<br>
very easy to access it with a 2 meter handitalkie with no outdoor<br>
antenna. Of course one of the advantages is that you can access ham radio<br>
BBSs and it is FREE! Ah yes!! Well I guess that is not exactly true!! You<br>
need an amateur license, 2 meter radio, data controller, and a computer.<br>
<p>
I noticed that in Cheryl's message that she had forgotten my call. I do<br>
not feel bad about that because I have had a rough time remembering her<br>
call!! But, Cheryl, I have a system now. I just think of X hertz.<br>
<p>
I apologize for boring the "other" net members on the net who are not<br>
hams.<br>

"And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying, "We will<br>
eat our own food and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by your<br>
name, to take away our reproach."" -- Isa 4:1 (NKJ)<br>
<p>
* Is this a prophecy?<br>
<p>
* Is it a coded/symbolic prophecy?<br>
<p>
If it is a coded prophecy, what does it mean:<br>
<p>
* "And in that day" -- what time period?<br>
<p>
* Woman means church, what about seven women?<br>
<p>
* "one man"<br>
<p>
* "our own food"<br>
<p>
* "Our own apparel"<br>
<p>
* "called by your name", whose name?<br>
<p>
Here is how the text "decodes" for me:<br>
<p>
  In the last days there will be many churches that will take hold of<br>
  Jesus name saying, "We will have our own traditions and assume our own<br>
  forms of righteousness; only let us be called Christians, in order that<br>
  our religion may be seen as legitimate.<br>
<p>
How does it read for you?<br>

<i>&gt; "Joe" has visited our church semi-regularly for four years at least.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Often he arrives late, only in time for pot luck.  When he does come in </i><br>
<i>&gt; time for church, he will sit in the back, not in the main sanctuary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He's very self-conscious about personal cleanliness but that doesn't mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; he is always cleaned up.  He has been homeless for most of this time. </i><br>
<i>&gt; He is essentially harmless and wouldn't hurt a fly.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Evidently in the period in which I was gone from Pittsburgh, and still</i><br>
<i>&gt; continuing now, there have been some problems mostly concerning the</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost compulsive and lengthy routine he goes through in the church's </i><br>
<i>&gt; restroom.  People of authority in the church have been speaking recently </i><br>
<i>&gt; about asking him to leave and never come back, and when I heard their </i><br>
<i>&gt; side of the story I had to admit that there is really a problem which </i><br>
<i>&gt; does need to be addressed.  Knowing "Joe's" track record it's unlikely </i><br>
<i>&gt; that he could change his behavior enough to reassure the large number </i><br>
<i>&gt; of people who are uncomfortable with his presence for a number of good </i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons. </i><br>
<p>
Well, since you don't detail what those reasons may be, it's hard to give<br>
an informed opinion on "Joe", but I'll give it a shot.  If his restroom<br>
"routine" is the main source of concern, keep in mind that he may have <br>
little opportunity for fastidiousness outside the perceived friendly<br>
confines of the church.  My impression is that his presence is tolerated<br>
but not welcomed.  Personally, I think rather than being shown the door,<br>
he should be encouraged to participate more.  His spiritual well-being is<br>
far more important than the sensibilities of church members whose track<br>
record of black intolerance is shameful. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are the homeless the next group that we must learn to tolerate?  Will it </i><br>
<i>&gt; hurt the yuppies to learn to tolerate them any more than it hurt the </i><br>
<i>&gt; rednecks of a generation ago to tolerate integration? </i><br>
<p>
If there is a group of people that are "different" from me for some reason, <br>
and those people are seeking our Savior, and my feeling is that I must<br>
"tolerate" their presence, then I submit that I'm a -lot- further from the <br>
Savior then they are.  No matter our color or circumstances, we are all equal<br>
in the eyes of the Lord.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And, as a city church, can we afford to ignore an important sector of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the population? </i><br>
<p>
No.<br>

have happy marriages.<br>

My interpretation of Isaiah 4:1  -- It is in context of the previous <br>
chapter talking about the overthrow of Israel as a proud and haughty woman.<br>
We see in the preceding verses the women being stripped of all their<br>
garments.  I think the prophecy is quite literal and not coded, with no<br>
particular reference to the church of today except:<br>
<p>
The idea of seven women taking hold of one man is encouraging to those of <br>
us males who are still bachelors.  For this class of people it is a <br>
great and wonderful promise of sorts.  If only it weren't in the context<br>
of reproached and humbled women grabbing on, it would be even more so.<br>

<p>
Numerous well-known and not-so-well-known Christian authors have<br>
written at length, and very well so, regarding SofS as love poetry.<br>
I have also heard folk speak on SofS as representing Christ' love<br>
for the church.  And seeing how God uses the metaphor of husband-and-wife<br>
for Christ-and-the-church it does not take any stretching to see both.<br>
<p>
Something else?  Well, we have a video from the Quiet Hour wherein some<br>
guests use SofS as a metaphor/model for the church thru apostolic times,<br>
the Dark Ages, the Reformation and so on.  And it seems to make sense.  It<br>
would not surprise me that God is using Song of Solomon for all of the above.<br>

<p>
Well, I've been partial to the belief that in some respects, it <br>
represents God's love for us.  Think of Solomon as Jesus, and <br>
Shulamith as "us".  I get the impression that she loves Solomon <br>
deeply, but feels unworthy of his love, wanting to know why he <br>
loves her.  He, in turn, tells her that if she doesn't know, then <br>
she should follow him and find out. (That's what I got from Chapter <br>
1.)<br>
<p>
Solomon had hundreds of wives and concubines.  Jesus has millions <br>
of followers.  Just as Shulamith needed reassurance of her <br>
uniqueness to Solomon, that she as an individual was special and <br>
loved for her own sake, we too wonder how Jesus could love each of <br>
us individually, worried that we may be lost in a sea of faces.<br>
<p>
Solomon's joy at his wedding is Jesus' joy at our choosing to be<br>
part of Him.  These sorts of parallels kind of jumped at me. <br>
<p>
Did anyone else get the same impression? <br>

<i> &gt;From Steve Timm:</i><br>
Even with the clear-cut evidence in this case, it still makes me<br>
uncomfortable to hear the attitudes of those proposing his dismissal.<br>
Are we setting a precedent by throwing out those who don't fit?  Will<br>
this enhance the spirit of classism already prevalent in this church?<br>
Who will be next?  Is the throwing out of the homeless the price we must<br>
pay to make our stated targed group, yuppies and baby boomers, comfortable?<br>
Will Joe be willing to leave Abraham's bosom to drop water on our tongues<br>
when the fire gets hot?  (Echoes of the parable of the rich man and Lazarus).<br>
--------------<br>
<p>
My comments:<br>
<p>
A pretty scary thought. I guess there are people in this world who would<br>
exclude on the basis that they are not us. <br>
<p>
I made a small comment in the last church newsletter that, because new<br>
members from our recent evangelistic crusade will be joining our church<br>
in the coming weeks, we needed to be prepared to accept them, warts and<br>
all, because we would like them to treat us in the same way and it's<br>
the way God intended for us to act.<br>
<p>
Does the Pittsburgh church have a tremendous number of 2nd and 3rd Generation<br>
SDAs? Not as much an indictment than an observation, I've observed a<br>
mainstream approach to our faith when we've been in this church "for<br>
life". We're starting to look like our Methodist and Baptist friends socially.<br>
For better or worse, we need to take a good hard look at our response to<br>
our brothers and sisters and wonder if we're doing as God would want us<br>
to do. <br>
<p>
To throw out the homeless to keep the beautiful people? Methinks, Steve,<br>
that the issue is much deeper than that. Are Baby Boomers that shallow<br>
to believe that image is much more important than belief? And are we <br>
really disguising our own prejudices by defending someone else's supposed<br>
prejudices?<br>

Because you do not tell us about the rest room situation in detail<br>
we must use our imaginations. Is it possible that in this age of<br>
child abuse and sex crimes, the members are concerned about children<br>
who might stumble into the bathroom unawares? After the airing of the<br>
Prime Time report on the Catholic priest who sexually abused dozens<br>
of children, parents are particularly extra-sensitive to this possibility.<br>
Tolerance or no tolerance, they won't risk this happening to their<br>
children.<br>
<p>
<p>
[This is precisely the issue.  Although these fears are probably unfounded,<br>
they are real.  I didn't want to give more details of the situation than <br>
necessary.  He has done nothing that would be considered sexually<br>
inappropriate, but he has behaved in away that is sufficiently out of<br>
order<br>
to arouse the above fears.  Everyone (myself included) agrees that something<br>
should be done, the question is what should or can be done.  SCT]<br>

It seems to me that we should take a different approach to this issue.  Rather <br>
than focusing on the baby boomers' attitudes, let's look at "Joe" and ask <br>
ourselves, "How would Jesus treat him?"  It seems obvious that Jesus would not <br>
turn Joe away.  Instead he would try to meet his needs.  I lack Jesus' <br>
omniscience, but it occurs to me that Joe's needs could be met in a way that <br>
would alleviate parents' fears.<br>
<p>
As one idea, what about assigning a deacon to pick Joe up early Sabbath morning, <br>
get him a good breakfast, give him a chance to take care of his personal <br>
hygiene, and then take Joe under his wing for the day.  This may allow Joe to <br>
get his needs met without offending others at the church, and it certainly is <br>
more in line with the duties of a deacon than just taking up the offering on <br>
Sabbath morning.  Joe may or may not ever be able to function appropriately on <br>
his own, but he can still give his life to the Savior, and it is the <br>
responsibility of the church to help the Holy Spirit work in his life.<br>
<p>
I heard an audio tape a couple years ago that was put out by Focus on the <br>
Family.  Entitled "A Man Called Norman", it is about how to treat others that <br>
are different from ourselves.  Norman has a lot in common with Joe.  I believe <br>
this story has been made into a movie.  Our church will be showing it for a <br>
Vespers program within a few weeks.  Maybe yours could do the same.<br>

I am sorry it has taken so long to reply to some of the feedback on the idea <br>
of a Seventh-day Adventist forum on Compuserve. I have just moved and it has <br>
taken a while to get settled.<br>
<p>
I think I didn't explain what a forum would be like for those who are not <br>
familiar with Compuserve. One section would be for messages much like SDAnet. <br>
I don't see this replacing SDAnet at all. The audience would be much different<br>
and I don't think it would have the same interest.<br>
<p>
The main purpose of a forum would be to have access to the Union Papers and <br>
all articles on line. Also other files could be available including templates <br>
for membership databases or finance software for churches. Another possible <br>
use would be uploading graphics that might be of particular interest to SDAs <br>
(i.e. Image of Daniel 2, etc.) It could grow to the point where other services<br>
would be available on line.<br>
<p>
It would be my desire to see SDAnet continue the important dialogues which <br>
occur now. A Compuserve forum would serve another purpose.<br>
<p>
A note on Compuserve E-Mail. It depends on which options you have as to what <br>
the charges are for E-Mail. Personally my volume is usually low enough that I <br>
pay nothing for receiving SDAnet. Occasionally traffic is high enough that I <br>
have a small surcharge. It is a small price to pay for the benefits received.<br>
With Compuserve Information Manager, the software I use, I can also see what <br>
is the subject of a message before downloading it. I can then decide if it is <br>
of value to me and choose to download it or delete it. There is no charge for <br>
the message if I delete it from my mail box before downloading it.<br>
<p>
I hope this helps clarify a few things.<br>

A recently published book by Harold Bloom, "The American Religion: The<br>
Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992), has a<br>
thought-provoking chapter on Adventism. Bloom read extensively in<br>
White's writings in preparation for writing this book. Some of his<br>
observations include:<br>
	Adventism is a "formerly racist church"<br>
	No American faith, not even Jehovah's Witnesses, has a theology<br>
	so convoluted as that of SDAs. "I observe this in admiration<br>
	not in disrespect.:<br>
<p>
	Bloom puzzles about the "enigma of her (White's) authority for<br>
	followers down to the present time."<br>
<p>
	He calls Adventist an "American Religion of Health, crossed<br>
	by the postapocalyptic dream of an end time never to be."<br>
<p>
	In regard to the Investigative Judgment, he says:<br>
	"I cannot think of another American doctrine, even among<br>
	the Jehovah's Witnesses, that assigns so crucial a role to<br>
	Satan. Were that malign spirit to be blotted out prematurely,<br>
	then there could be no salvation for Seventh-day Adventists.<br>
	Ellen White's Jesus is more a defense attorney for mankind<br>
	than he is the bearer of the Atonement...we are given, in<br>
	effect...a Satanic Atonement. Perhaps that is the final ven-<br>
	geance of those who suffered the Millerite Great Disappointment<br>
	of 1844."<br>
<p>
	"Pragmatically, the vicarious nature of the Atonement has<br>
	passed from Christ to Satan, with some rather dark<br>
	psychological consequences in Adventist believers."<br>
<p>
	"If you teach children that failure to keep the Seventh-day<br>
	Sabbath will bring upon them the Mark of the Beast, then you are<br>
	in danger of scapegoating children."<br>
<p>
	He predicts Adventism will "dwindle away into a purely medical<br>
	sect if such 'doctrinal modification' goes much further<br>
	(the second coming becoming more distant, upper-class<br>
	materialistic values)...Either Adventism will return to her<br>
	vision of shamanism as a branch of the American Religion,<br>
	or it will vanish from among us except as a vast medical<br>
	legacy."<br>
<p>
These are among the many interesting observations Bloom makes.<br>
<p>
There are chapters on Mormonism, Christian Science, Southern Baptist,<br>
Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentecostalism, The New Age, and others as well.<br>

Indeed, here is a good opportunity to see the importance of correct hermeneuticsIf one's rules call for taking the simplest, straight forward meaning of a text<br>
within its context, we have one result.  If we go first to a prophetic or figur-<br>
ative sense, we get another idea.<br>
<p>
If we look for the simplest meaning, nearest to the context, we have Israel<br>
decimated by the invaders, the men killed off in battle.  The women who are<br>
left want husbands, not necessarily support.  Why would women want husbands?<br>
The historical social context of Israel in OT times indicates that a woman was<br>
fulfilled only if she had children.  Obviously, this is a prophecy, but unless<br>
we find it applied by another Bible writer to a later period, the primary <br>
application is the most normal.<br>
<p>
So would a rule that the normal, simple, literal interpretation is to be pre-<br>
ferred unless there is clear evidence of something else be valid?<br>

Jesus and the Bible writer's didn't always seem to use our methods<br>
of interpretation when citing the Old Testament.<br>

The fact that parents may be concerned about their children should NOT be<br>
a reason to ban Joe from coming to church.  In fact, I think it would be<br>
an excellent opportunity to teach the children at your church about people<br>
who are different, about how to have a healthy cautiousness towards<br>
strangers without evoking fear.  It also may have a positive effect in<br>
keeping the kids from lingering and playing around in the bathroom.  My<br>
own experience with kids and church has been that many times kids ask to<br>
go to the bathroom from their classes merely to "escape" Sabbath School or<br>
church.  If bathroom use was limited to between services where plenty of<br>
adult supervision would be available there should be nothing to fear about<br>
Joe in the bathroom.<br>
<p>
The time following church and during the potluck might be a bit more difficult<br>
but I still think that it shouldn't be a problem if kids are taught to go<br>
to the restroom with at least one friend.  In fact, this is very good habit<br>
to develop no matter where a child is.<br>
<p>
If the church members are seriously concerned about Joe, someone on the<br>
board might contact the local police and see if Joes has any kind of<br>
record of complaints against him.  The lack of such a record could be<br>
used to alleviate the concerns some might have.  Then reach out the this<br>
hurting man in a Christian manner and don't push him away.  Jesus certainly<br>
would not behave this way.  Remember that church exists for everyone, not<br>
the elite of this world who don't seem to have problems.<br>

Hi Steve,<br>
	I have a friend who bought the Ellen White CD and runs it on his<br>
CD ROM. He wrote a Wordperfect macro to edit texts from it into continuous<br>
text files. Using that, he can get any article from her writings in a text<br>
file. If you want any E. G. White writings as a text file, I can send it<br>
to you. I have Steps to Christ, Thoughts from the Mt. of Blessing, GC chapters<br>
32 to the end, the 1st 9 chapters of PP, texts about the nature of Christ,<br>
prayer, planning for public evengelism, and other stuff.<br>

I haven't read the license agreement with the software for the EGW CD-ROM<br>
but you might check to see that this "exporting" is not a violation of the<br>
agreement.  I will check with the people at the EG White estate here at<br>
Andrews and see what their feeling is about this.  The EG White CD-ROM and<br>
software is now available for the Macintosh as well as the PC.<br>

I would like to get copys of those macros!!  My school, Union College, has<br>
that cd on an ibm compt. computer in the library.  I would like to get it<br>
on-line with the HP system.  i was wandering if any one knows of any<br>
software for the unix that will access the E G white cd ??  If not it<br>
might be posible to copy it over as a readable text file (all of it) and<br>
then have students up macros from wp to search it.  combersome but could<br>
work.  Any ideas????  Scott Bechtel<br>

Beng Tang actually sent me the first chapter of "Steps To Christ"<br>
as a demonstration of what the software could do.  I didn't post it <br>
for the twin reason that it's awfully big and clearly in the US<br>
we would be violating some copyright.  I don't know if those copyright<br>
laws apply to him in Singapore or not, but one should be careful <br>
about doing much with it in the US of A.<br>
<p>
How much on-line stuff is possible would depend on whether or not the <br>
text is compressed on the CD-ROM.  When I was a student at Andrews University<br>
I worked on a project where we compressed the entire Bible and its<br>
concordance into less space than the uncompressed Bible would take up.  <br>
This created "The Lamp", a project which was technically ahead of its time<br>
but was hopelessly outmarketed and undersupported.  (I believe this project<br>
is now defunct at AU.)  When it came time to do the EGW project, <br>
they went with an outside contractor to do the software (smart).  With <br>
the storage space available on CD, probably compression is not necessary.<br>
Does anyone know how well the CD is indexed and cross-referenced? e.g.<br>
is every search a sequential search through the whole volume or are <br>
there some keys, or better yet, a full on-disk concordance?<br>
<p>
If the CD is in the format I think it is in, a Unix link would be <br>
technically trivial and legally a nightmare.<br>

A recent message stated:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Waldensian SDA's"</i><br>
<i>&gt;seems like quite a contradiction in terms because the Waldenses are known</i><br>
<i>&gt;not to have kept the Sabbath.</i><br>
<p>
There is historical evidence that the Waldenses observed the Sabbath on<br>
Saturday during the middle ages, though some may also have observed<br>
Sunday.  For a discussion of this, see History of the Sabbath by<br>
J.N. Andrews or Truth Triumphant by Wilkinson.  They give the<br>
historical evidence.  I think they are available from Leaves of<br>
Autumn Press in Arizona, or Hartland Institute in Virginia.<br>
<p>
These books also contain evidence that the Waldenses originated in<br>
the days of the apostles or their immediate descendents, contrary<br>
to some history books today that say they originated about 1200.<br>
Thus the Waldenses represent a continuous descent from the early<br>
Christian Church, independent of the Roman Catholic church.<br>

On Wed, 13 May 1992 11:40:37 -0400 (EDT) you said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am not sure where the "food animals" appear in the text.  Perhaps I need to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be shown what phrase they are hiding in.</i><br>
<p>
  See 1 Tim 4:3 and 4<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Other questions about diet:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Original diet= Gen 1:29--seeds and fruits</i><br>
<i>&gt;Post-sin diet= Gen 3:18--plants are added.  Maybe spinach and broccoli!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Post flood diet=Gen 9:3,4--meat but not the blood.  The fact that more of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;clean animals were in the ark suggests that these were the ones for food.</i><br>
<p>
  The last, post flood, is interesting, because God says in 3 that<br>
'Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green<br>
herb have I given you all things.'<br>
<p>
  That sounds like clean and unclean.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Vegetarianism is not an article of faith.   Knowing what we know today about</i><br>
<i>&gt;cholesterol, fat, infections, calories, and cleanliness, it may be a matter</i><br>
<i>&gt;of wisdom.  What I do to my body--where God desires to dwell through the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Holy Spirit--has spiritual implications.  Since what affects my body also</i><br>
<i>&gt;affects my nervous system, and the only way God has to communicate with me is</i><br>
<i>&gt;through my brain and nerves, I feel strongly that I need to keep in good</i><br>
<i>&gt;condition.  The health responsibility includes much more than no meat.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;must include other aspects of diet, exercise, rest, fresh air, cleanliness,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and trust in the divine physician.</i><br>
<p>
  Like I said, I don't disagree with these ideas.<br>

<i>&gt; The Waldensian church survived the persecution of the Middle Ages and</i><br>
<i>&gt; is still active, but small, today.  It is responsible for one of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; only Protestant translations of the Bible into Italian.  "Waldensian SDA's"</i><br>
<i>&gt; seems like quite a contradiction in terms because the Waldenses are known </i><br>
<i>&gt; not to have kept the Sabbath.</i><br>
<p>
There are several quotes I could dig up that indicate that at least some<br>
if not all of the Waldenses were pursued to their deaths because they<br>
were Sabbatarians.  It is possible that originally they were, as a<br>
church body, Sabbatarian.<br>

<i>&gt; # A non-SDA friend of mine that I see frequently.  He ended up wanting to</i><br>
<i>&gt; # talk about tithing.  He said that his not tithing used to bother him</i><br>
<i>&gt; # enormously but he thanks God that He has delivered him from that</i><br>
<i>&gt; # affliction so that he can now go about with a free conscience over it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; # He anticipates that in His own good time God will make the way possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; # and show him when and how to go about tithing.  "Its in the Lord's</i><br>
<i>&gt; # hands now and so I don't worry about it anymore."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And people wonder why they don't see God moving in their lives!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My take on tithing is pretty simple.  God owns it all.  Ten percent is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the starting point in my giving.  God has given me a job and an</i><br>
<i>&gt; income.  Every penny belongs to Him.  And I recall that when it comes</i><br>
<i>&gt; time to write the check.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
 I also have a pretty simple view on tithing.  It is very clear in the Bible    that God wants us to tithe.  It is also very clear that if we do not tithe we   are stealing from God.  And we all now that to steal is to break one of the ten commandments.  It is probably all the worse when we steal from God.   <br>

This morning's short-form Paul Harvey news included mention of the<br>
new dietary recommendations of the US gov't.  He chuckled and said<br>
they are finally catching up with what Ellen White said 100 years ago.<br>
Might be interesting to catch his long-form noon news and see if<br>
he expands any on that.<br>
<p>
Also, recently, he recommended Vandeman's "Cry of the Lonely Planet."<br>
Evidently he keeps some track of things in the SDA church.<br>

I too thank Enoch and Christine for getting this thing started.<br>
I will express my only concern in the form of a wish.....that the<br>
"mail" on this list never be subject to any sort of prior restraint<br>
ie. screening for content prior to posting.  I recall that at least<br>
one other list does this as a matter of policy.  Those of us using<br>
bitnet subscribe to a code of on-line conduct which is necessary and<br>
sufficient.  What do the other list members think?<br>

Christine Hwang has asked me to take over her function as keeper of<br>
the SDA-L membership list, which I have agreed to do.<br>
We are still working out the technical details.  There will be<br>
an update in a couple days.  However, no immediate changes to the<br>
format of either SDA-L or SDAnet are in order.<br>
 <br>
I know the work at Enoch's end of the thing handling all the technical<br>
details is even more time-consuming than Christine's end of it.<br>
Certainly it would help if we could add another co-listowner who is<br>
actually at LLUVM.  There are other people who have also volunteered to<br>
help, and I will be contacting them soon.<br>
 <br>
Enoch and Christine haven't got anywhere near the credit they deserve<br>
for making the capacity of a LISTSERV available to us.  LLUVM is<br>
the only VM node in the Adventist system, to my knowledge, and it's<br>
a resource I don't take lightly.  Netland owes a debt of gratitude to<br>
their management for making this available, and we want to see it continue.<br>
 <br>
Once all the technical details are worked out, we'll post a status report<br>
and then begin a discussion of what SDA-L should be.<br>

      I'm curious about the dietary positions of the SDA church.<br>
      Are you strict vegetarians ? Can you eat any kind of meat<br>
      or poultry ?  Do you have any good recipe books to suit your<br>
      dietary habits ? ?<br>
 <br>
      Thanks in advance<br>

I would say the position is to treat your body with as much care and<br>
reverence as you would God's temple, for indeed the Holy Spirit dwells in<br>
the believer who invites His presence.  Therefore, as part of presenting<br>
your body as a "living sacrifice" (i.e., what I do to my body is in as<br>
much subjection to God's will as my thoughts are to be) I will choose what<br>
I find in Scripture as God's best for my body (EGW elaborates extensively,<br>
but the basis is found in Scripture).  By noting that God's original diet<br>
for man involved fruits, grains, nuts, and vegetables, one concludes that<br>
this is the best.  However, SDAs who do choose to include meat in their<br>
diet (e.g., my father used to pastor a church in the Canadian Maritimes<br>
wherein most of the members were deep sea fishermen; I know folk here in<br>
Arizona who raise beef cattle) should remember to observe the restrictions<br>
which God lays out in Leviticus.  See also Gen ch.9 which outlines what<br>
we might today call "kosher" prep (altho there are various forms of Jewish<br>
kosher, some of which are difficult to understand; many are probably<br>
well founded, tho, IMHO).  These rules for what constitutes "clean" meat<br>
and how to prepare were not arbitrary on God's part.  HE has our best good<br>
in mind.  The challenge to the believer then is:  Do I want God's best<br>
for my life?<br>
<p>
There ought to be Scripture references for the half dozen or so verses I am<br>
roughly quoting above.  I'm just gonna have to get a Unix-based Bible search<br>
program; my DOS-based one is at home.<br>
<p>
For recipe books:  there are many.  Any SDA bookstore (Adventist Book Center,<br>
check local Yellow Pages) will have a glut of these.  Our family has<br>
concluded it is best to avoid free fats/oils and sugar (note also recent<br>
USDA suggestions).  Therefore I have found the books put out by Weimar<br>
Institute and Dr. Agatha Trash to be among the best (there are others<br>
equally good, but I forget their names).  One can also find others that<br>
do not share our position, i.e., include added oils, sugar.<br>

<i>&gt; I think SDA-L should remain unmoderated.  Abuse of this network just hasn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; been a problem.  As long as SDA-L stays away from heavy doctrinal</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussion and discussion of touchy issues within the church, we'll be fine.</i><br>
 <br>
I never post things which are better left unsaid, but the above "could" be<br>
read as a bit confusing.  First you state that the SDA-L should remain<br>
unmoderated, but then you stipulate "what" the people should or should not<br>
discuss.  I am both a new member as well as a member who has never posted,<br>
but in the name of free will, free choice, free speech, and our God given<br>
right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, I would suggest not<br>
changing the status of SDA-L or it's membership may decline.<br>
 <br>
:)  Just my $.02 worth.<br>
[This message is going only to SDAnet, so it seems a little incongruous<br>
to say this here, but it's worthwhile to recap the history of the two nets<br>
for our new readers.<br>
SDAnet started in June of 1990, SDA-L a few months later, independently<br>
of each other.  SDAnet was moderated from the first, SDA-L never was.<br>
In March and April of 1991, we tried joint distribution of all messages<br>
jointly.  Nobody really liked this situation, in particular many on the <br>
SDA-L side expressed their dislike of heavy doctrinal discussions, and <br>
on the SDAnet side I was uncomfortable with all the flames from their echo<br>
that I couldn't control.  It was decided that the SDAnet posts would<br>
no longer be echoed to SDA-L, and that SDA-L would be primarily for<br>
fellowship among students and faculty at various campuses.  Unfortunately,<br>
such a topic generates almost no traffic, and SDA-L has been almost dead<br>
for the last year.<br>
<p>
I am in the final stages of arranging to become one of their listowners<br>
to replace Christine Hwang, at Christine's request.  The goal is to generate<br>
enough traffic on that list so that people will know it is there, but many <br>
of their subscribers don't like the heavy traffic of SDAnet.  So my <br>
message of free speech is actually intended to expand the traffic on that<br>
net, and the policy of refraining from doctrinal discussion has been a rule<br>
followed on that list for almost a year.<br>
<p>
In the case that SDA-L traffic does pick up, those who are not members of <br>
that list won't be able to respond to posts that come from there directly.<br>
There is a way to be a member of that list and this one without receiving<br>
double copies, but right now that requires intervention of the SDA-L <br>
listowner.  We are negotiating the technical details to make this work<br>
easier. SCT]<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; SDAnet members, if you receive two copies of this message send me mail</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I can tell you how to avoid that.</i><br>
 <br>
Yes, I did.  Why?  Am I on TWO membership lists?<br>
[I sent that message twice by accident.  Sorry.  SCT] <br>

  I just opened my Bible looking for something totally different and my<br>
attention was caught by the word Presbytery in the index.  After reading<br>
about presbytery in 1 Tim 4:14 I started reading from v1.  Paul is<br>
telling the people about what will happen in the 'latter times'.<br>
<p>
  I leave it to the reader of this note to check out 1 Tim 4 for<br>
themselves.<br>
<p>
  Paul says that animal flesh was good, from God, intended for our<br>
eating, and that all animals fall into this category.  In fact, he talks<br>
quite strongly against those who would do the things listed in verse 3.<br>
<p>
  As I understand it you don't forbid the eating of meat, just say that<br>
the original diet of Adam and Eve is better (can't argue with that, why,<br>
even modern science is catching on to that).<br>

  Our connection to the Internet has been flacky the last week, so I<br>
wonder if that is why I haven't seen any reply to Eric's comments about<br>
soul sleep v. immortal soul.  Or has no one any comments about it?<br>

<i>&gt; 11  trying to regain control!</i><br>
 <br>
     Dave, when I examine your above paragraph, I note a contradiction.<br>
     On line 6, you mention that many Christians echo Paul's desire<br>
     to be "absent from the body" and be with the Lord.  Then in<br>
     line 8, you state that "we will receive a new body" when Jesus<br>
     comes.  If when we die, we go out of existence until Jesus returns<br>
     and then we receive a new body,  we never were "absent from the<br>
     body", thus, there would be no reason to be "absent from the body"<br>
     Let me restate what I see as an inconsistency in your logic:<br>
 <br>
     "If there is never a case where we could be absent from the body,<br>
     why would we echo Paul's desire to be absent from the body"<br>
 <br>
       In english, the word absent is about as straight-forward as it<br>
     gets.  If I am absent from work, I still exist, I just exist apart<br>
     from work.  If the SDA position on soul-sleep is correct, wouldn't<br>
     Paul have said "I prefer to be in my new body and at home with the<br>
     the Lord" or something like that?  It takes as much work to explain<br>
     the phrase "absent from the body" for the person who holds to "soul<br>
     sleep" as does the phase "those asleep in Jesus" for those who hold<br>
     the "soul/spirit survives death postion".<br>
 <br>
       Another verse that I believe needs to be looked at is 2 Cor 12:2<br>
     and 3. Paul is writing about his experience of being caught up into<br>
     Paradise.  Verse 2 reads:<br>
 <br>
        I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago-whether in the<br>
     body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows-<br>
     such a man was caught up to the third heaven.<br>
                                         II Cor. 12:2    NASB.<br>
 <br>
        I want to make a few comments.  First, yes, I believe that new-<br>
     age philosophies are running rampant in our country.  Yes, there<br>
     are some new-agers who claim to have OBE (Out of body experiences).<br>
     Should Bible-believing Christians be involved or attempt to have<br>
     OBE?  Definitely NOT.  Should we who claim to be Christians and<br>
     believe the Scriptures for our rule for life participate in any<br>
     kind of new age activites....Absolutely NOT.  Ok, now that thats<br>
     out of the way, lets look honestly at what Paul's saying here.<br>
     He had an experience and he states as clearly as it could be said.<br>
     "whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body, I do<br>
     not know".  Paul is admitting that he doesn't know whether he was<br>
     in his body or out of his body when this happened.  He obviously<br>
     considered both a possibility, otherwise he wouldn't have said it<br>
     in verse 2, then repeated himself in verse 3.  If Paul didn't<br>
     consider it possibly to be out of his body, then, he "would have<br>
     known".  If Paul was out of his body, then what part of him was<br>
     out of his body?  What ever was out of his body was certainly<br>
     conscience ( he heard things which are unspeakable ).  If one<br>
     would conclude that he was "in the body", would they then also<br>
     conclude that his body was in Paradise....the third heaven ?<br>
 <br>
     Have a great weekend<br>

1 Tim 4:1-5 describes what Christians could expect in the future.  Evil persons,deceived by demons, would try to teach another gospel than what Paul had<br>
preached.  They would condemn marriage and foods which God had created to be<br>
enjoyed by humans.  --One must be careful to leave together those elements that<br>
appear together in a verse--.  These good things--marriage and food--were given<br>
by God as gifts to the believers. And everything God makes is good--did not God<br>
himself say so at creation?<br>
<p>
Paul's prophecy did not take long to be fulfilled.  The Gnostics of the second<br>
century developed rules to put down the body, since it was matter and matter<br>
was not good.  Severe fasting, sexual abstinence in marriage, etc. were de-<br>
signed to keep the body--which was evil, because it was matter.  Some of these<br>
same ideas were later taken over by the monks who deprived themselves of food,<br>
clothes, and sleep, in order to perfect themselves.  <br>
<p>
The word broma in Greek means food in general.  Meat is not mentioned in the<br>
text.  <br>
<p>
Everything that God created is good: food and sex included.  However, nothing<br>
in the text gives permission to use God's good gifts for the wrong purpose.<br>
Clearly God gave Adam and Eve an ideal diet: fruits, grains, nuts.  He also<br>
set up the ideal sex life: marriage.  <br>
<p>
Let's thank our wonderful Creator for his good gifts and use them wisely!<br>
<p>

I interpret Paul's statement ``absent from the body'' to mean<br>
``absent from this body.''  He wants to be present with the Lord.<br>
When, according to the Bible, are we present with the Lord?  According<br>
to John 14:1-3 it is when Jesus returns.  According to 1 Thess. 4:<br>
15 - 18 we are with the Lord when he returns.  According to<br>
Titus 2:13 the blessed hope is the return of Jesus, not to go to<br>
heaven at death.<br>
<p>
Why would Paul want to be absent from the body?  There is nothing<br>
evil about having a body;  Adam and Eve had a body before they<br>
sinned.  We will have a body when Jesus returns.  I think Paul<br>
mainly wants to be free from the sinful desires of the flesh.<br>
<p>
In vision, we might seem to be in heaven while our body is really<br>
here.  How the Lord accomplishes that I don't know.<br>
<p>
I appreciate your honest questions.  Please continue to discuss<br>
this if you are not satisfied.<br>

In discussions with Enoch Hwang in the past week, we have come to the<br>
following agreement:<br>
 <br>
Enoch Hwang will stay with SDA-L and keep the same responsibilities he<br>
has always had with the list, namely being in charge of the technical<br>
details at LLUVM, as well as being the first and deciding list-owner.<br>
The list may move nodes this summer as La Sierra gets its own Internet<br>
connection.<br>
 <br>
I (Steve Timm) will be added to the list as a list-owner.  For the time<br>
being I will maintain the directory of list members, although in time<br>
I'd be willing to have helpers in this task.  We are still working on<br>
the technical details of what it will take to add me as a listowner, so<br>
please hold off all subscriber requests for a little while longer while<br>
we are working this out.  We are exploring ways to give better service<br>
on SET NOMAIL commands as well as subscribing and desubscribing.<br>
When these are worked out, I'll post another message to the net.<br>
 <br>
Part of the hassle for the listowners of SDA-L to date has been lots of<br>
people that move away and don't desubscribe from the list.  I see a lot<br>
of people that I know from SDAnet are long gone from addresses, still<br>
current on the SDA-L list.  Mail to these people bounces and goes to the<br>
listowners.<br>
 <br>
The SDA-L membership list has historically been public, in fact, anyone<br>
across the country can REVIEW SDA-L and get it.  It's possible to hide<br>
yourself from this review if you wish.  I will send details once we get it<br>
worked out.  The SDAnet membership list has been posted a couple times<br>
before, but any members who don't want their name posted as part of the<br>
membership directory should let me know and I will leave it out.<br>
The new edition of the membership directory will come out shortly.<br>
 <br>
More details to follow, and once again we want to thank Christine for<br>
her service to SDA-L in the past year and a half, and congratulate her<br>
on the upcoming completion of her degree.<br>
 <br>
Steve Timm<br>

A few months ago I was reading in Adventists Affirm about the three<br>
waves of the Pentecostal movement.<br>
<p>
More revently I was looking at some of the glossy bound publications<br>
of the World Council of Churches.  These publications prominently<br>
display three wavy lines.  The three wavy lines seem to have become<br>
one of the symbols of Ecumenical.  In these documents, right along<br>
side the RCC, are statements indicating that the SDA church endorses<br>
the motions and proceedings published within the documents.  The<br>
response from the GC has been that those SDA professors who have<br>
chosen to be members on these councils are there for their own personal<br>
reasons and are not delegates of the GC.  BUT, I was looking at<br>
the Review &amp; Herald I received in the mail yesterday.  On the cover<br>
and throughout the paper (one exception I think) I see that the three<br>
angels have been replaced with the three wavy lines.  Has our church<br>
decided to replace our symbols of identity with the symbols of ecumenical?<br>
The three angels are symbol of "come out of Babylon [Ecumenical]"<br>
While the three wavy lines are symbol of -- lets join up with<br>
Ecumenical [Babylon].  How can our church continue to deny an<br>
aloofness from Ecumenical when we are adopting the symbols?<br>
<p>
Is our church becoming Ecumenical?<br>
<p>
Is Ecumenical something our church should be embracing?<br>
<p>
What should be our church's position on the Ecumenical movement?<br>
<p>
What about our church's endorsements in the World Council of Churches?<br>
<p>
Oh, BTW, one of the few church's objecting to the proceedings of the<br>
WCC was the Waldensian church.  Somehow I thought they had been<br>
exterminated by the time of the Protestant Reformation.  Then more<br>
recently I heard about a summer camp meeting this summer to be<br>
sponsored by the "Waldensian SDAs".  Who are they?  Has anyone heard<br>
of them before?<br>

I think some clarification on the SDA position on diet is in order.<br>
To my knowledge, I don't think any SDA's claim that the Bible<br>
enjoins vegetarianism on all.  The official church position is that <br>
we are allowed to eat clean meats only.  So Nancy Vyhmeister's analysis<br>
of the warning against people who forbid the eating of certain meats was<br>
designed to show that it is not directed against us per se.  In this <br>
analysis I agree with her.<br>

I'm not in a position to address the thrust of the article, but ...<br>
<p>
[davidbu@loowit.wr.tek.com writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; Oh, BTW, one of the few church's objecting to the proceedings of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; WCC was the Waldensian church.  Somehow I thought they had been</i><br>
<i>&gt; exterminated by the time of the Protestant Reformation.</i><br>
<p>
If my recall of Wylie's History of the Reformation is correct, persecution<br>
of the Waldenses continued thru near the end of the 19th century.  As<br>
recently as 1962, when my family and I visited Torre Pelice, the Waldensian<br>
church was still alive.  I believe that there are some SDAs amongst the<br>
Waldensians (but this is trying to remember 30 years ago, when I was 8).<br>
My wife visited Waldensian churches during pre Youth Congress tour, 1969.<br>
<p>
For Reformation history fans:  We got the complete Wylie history of<br>
the Reformation thru Great Christian Books (ask 800-555-1212 for their 800<br>
number).  We tracked D'Aubigne's book thru the publisher, Baker Book House.<br>
<p>
As a side note on the Waldensian church ... my wife distinctly recalls<br>
reading a Review &amp; Herald article from the late 50's or 60's in which<br>
an interview with a Waldensian pastor was published.  He indicated that<br>
the church was dying because the youth were leaving.  This is what happened:<br>
The youth were allured by the dazzle of wordly pleasures and pasttimes.<br>
To try to keep their youth, the Waldensian church set up a dance hall in<br>
their mountain community so that the youth would not need to go to the cities,<br>
beyond the chaperonage of their parents.  This appeared to work .. but not<br>
for long.  Rather, the worldliness increased and spirituality declined;<br>
the youth left the church anyway.<br>
<p>
No matter how praiseworthy the goal, the tools of darkness are incompatible<br>
with God's work; they result in confusion.  "... God is light, and in Him<br>
is no darkness at all. (1Jn1:5)"  "... let us cast off the works of darkness,<br>
and let us put on the armour of light. (Rm13:12)"  "... for what fellowship<br>
hath righteousness with unrighteousness?  and what communion hath light<br>
with darkness? (2Co6:14)"  "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?<br>
not one. (Job14:4)"  See also Eze 22:26, 44:23; Hag 2:11-13.<br>

On Mon, 11 May 1992 10:13:13 -0400 (EDT) you said:<br>
<i>&gt;1 Tim 4:1-5 describes what Christians could expect in the future.  Evil</i><br>
<i>&gt;persons,deceived by demons, would try to teach another gospel than what Paul</i><br>
<i>&gt;had</i><br>
<i>&gt;preached.  They would condemn marriage and foods which God had created to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;enjoyed by humans.  --One must be careful to leave together those elements that</i><br>
<i>&gt;appear together in a verse--.  These good things--marriage and food--were given</i><br>
<i>&gt;by God as gifts to the believers. And everything God makes is good--did not God</i><br>
<i>&gt;himself say so at creation?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;...... some deleted ............</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The word broma in Greek means food in general.  Meat is not mentioned in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;text.</i><br>
<p>
         From The New Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the<br>
         Bible<br>
<p>
         Broma, bro-mah; food (lit. or fig.). espec. (cer.)<br>
         articles allowed or forbidden by the Jewish law<br>
         :- meat, victuals.       &lt;---- how the word is translated in KJV<br>
<p>
  You are right that 'meat' is not spoken by word, but, being careful to<br>
keep things together, the following verse makes clear that Paul is<br>
talking about food animals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Everything that God created is good: food and sex included.  However, nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the text gives permission to use God's good gifts for the wrong purpose.</i><br>
<p>
  True, how we use something counts for/against us as much as what we<br>
use.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Clearly God gave Adam and Eve an ideal diet: fruits, grains, nuts.  He also</i><br>
<i>&gt;set up the ideal sex life: marriage.</i><br>
<p>
  While I agree that the vegge diet is healthier, here are some things<br>
that struck me while thinking on this;<br>
<p>
1) when Adam and Eve were ushered out of Eden, the first thing God does<br>
   is kill an animal to clothe them.  I wonder if he didn't also show<br>
   them how to prepare venison at the same time.<br>
<p>
2) Abel kept flocks, wonder what for.<br>
<p>
3) Noah was told to eat animals<br>
<p>
4) God, in the OT, demanded animal sacrifices.  As part of their wages<br>
   God stated that part of those sacrifices (and those of non-animal<br>
   type) were for the Levites to eat.<br>
<p>
5) Jesus at fish, at least.<br>
<p>
6) Paul says animals were given for our eating.<br>

I believe that the listserv has a built-in facility for such an<br>
occurrence.  If said user does not post within a certain length of time,<br>
the listserv would send email to the user telling him/her to confirm<br>
their membership by sending a CONFIRM SDA-L command to LISTSERV, and<br>
giving the user a week or so to do so.  If the user fails to send the<br>
command, then (s)he will be automatically unsubscribed from the list.<br>
Just thought I'd bring this up for the list owners so that they may<br>
utilize this feature and get less bounced mail.<br>

Dave asks three questions:  The first one, "Is the SDA church becoming<br>
ecumenical" is certainly yes.  I think no one can deny that we are much <br>
less a peculiar people than we were even twenty years ago.  Just the fact<br>
that there is no real persecution right now should tell us something.<br>
<p>
Should our church be more ecumenical?  I think here we have both<br>
responsibilities and cautions to be aware of.  If we are the logical and<br>
natural extension of the Protestant reformation as we claim, then <br>
we have a responsibility to share the truth we know with our fellow <br>
Protestant denominations.  We should not shun contact with<br>
interdenominational assemblies if it is clear that we can proclaim the<br>
truth.<br>
<p>
At the same time, we should be very wary about language where unity is <br>
achieved at the expense of abandoning doctrine or say that "what you believe <br>
about this really isn't important" or some such.  While I have found it <br>
helpful to join Christian friends of other denominations in prayer circles,<br>
nevertheless the tension comes through if one is planning any kind of<br>
a teaching ministry.  <br>
<p>
The Waldensian church survived the persecution of the Middle Ages and<br>
is still active, but small, today.  It is responsible for one of the <br>
only Protestant translations of the Bible into Italian.  "Waldensian SDA's"<br>
seems like quite a contradiction in terms because the Waldenses are known <br>
not to have kept the Sabbath.<br>

To Scott Mattes:<br>
<p>
Scott I believe you have "works" in correct perspective. A "red-blooded"<br>
Adventist (Grin!!) in fact I should say "any" instead of "A", will agree<br>
with you. Where the "rub" comes is when a person focuses on "works'<br>
entirely when our focus should be on Jesus Christ. I am sure that some on<br>
this SDA net will disagree but........ I come back to the premise that I<br>
have said before, we are saved by faith and faith only, but that faith if<br>
it is true faith will produce a "life of obedience." You know what cheap<br>
grace is which is the idea once you accept Christ you no longer have to<br>
have good works you can do any old thing which is not true.<br>
<p>
The other faction is just as bad if not worse in Adventism when people<br>
think that people can only be talking about cheap grace when they talk<br>
about accepting Christ by faith. There is a difference.<br>

Yes however I think we should bear in mind that the Waldensian church of<br>
today is not the same as that of 400 years ago, and I don't think that<br>
their current translation is as precise as the text they had 400 yrs ago<br>
either. Historically there is _much_ evidence to suggest that they kept<br>
the Sabbath.<br>
<p>
Check out "Facts of Faith" and "The Church in the Wilderness" <br>
by Wilkerson and ...(I can't remember his name)<br>

A few weeks ago there were those protesting how the drug laws were<br>
infringing on freedoms.  People having their cash taken away because<br>
they bought their airline tickets with cash - the drug cops assuming<br>
that anyone in an airport with a large sum of cash was out to make<br>
a drug deal.  Cars, learjets, etc found guilty of having drugs aboard.<br>
For example a charter flight company looses his learjet because his<br>
passenger was carrying drugs and the drug dealer was anonymously<br>
reported.  The dealer and the jet were found guilty.  The owner of<br>
the plane finally got his plane back by buying it at the auction.<br>
<p>
More recently the news has shifted to LA, which HiLites yet another<br>
set of concerns.<br>
<p>
The inability of the court system to push back on crime, especially<br>
in the area of drugs, seems to be building up a rather big head of<br>
steam that could backlash even more aggressively with laws designed<br>
for the "good of the majority" at the expense of individual freedoms.<br>
<p>
What about the reports on the activities of the Lord's Day Alliance<br>
and the Moral Majority (or are they still around), and other groups<br>
pushing for state support of religion?<br>
<p>
Anyone on SDAnet wish to comment further?<br>

Yes, Strong does admit that broma is translated "meat" and "victuals" in the<br>
KJV.  Those translations reflect 17th century usage and not Greek meaning.<br>
Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich, standard Greek-English lexicon clearly states the<br>
meaning as food, either literal or figurative.  The word appears in the NT 16<br>
times, meaning food in general.  <br>
<p>
I am not sure where the "food animals" appear in the text.  Perhaps I need to<br>
be shown what phrase they are hiding in.<br>
<p>
Other questions about diet:<br>
Original diet= Gen 1:29--seeds and fruits<br>
Post-sin diet= Gen 3:18--plants are added.  Maybe spinach and broccoli!<br>
Post flood diet=Gen 9:3,4--meat but not the blood.  The fact that more of the<br>
clean animals were in the ark suggests that these were the ones for food.<br>
<p>
Vegetarianism is not an article of faith.   Knowing what we know today about<br>
cholesterol, fat, infections, calories, and cleanliness, it may be a matter<br>
of wisdom.  What I do to my body--where God desires to dwell through the<br>
Holy Spirit--has spiritual implications.  Since what affects my body also<br>
affects my nervous system, and the only way God has to communicate with me is<br>
through my brain and nerves, I feel strongly that I need to keep in good<br>
condition.  The health responsibility includes much more than no meat.  I <br>
must include other aspects of diet, exercise, rest, fresh air, cleanliness,<br>
and trust in the divine physician.<br>

I'm curious about how you interpret Hosea 2:11.  Hosea is clearly symbolic<br>
of the way the Lord relates to his fallen church.  This verse says, "I will<br>
also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, and her new moons, and<br>
her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts."  If Sabbath celebration was to<br>
last through eternity, how do you interpret this?  The feast days, new moons,<br>
and solemn feasts of Judaism have ceased.  Does this really mean that the<br>
all important sabbath, the sign of his chosen people would also cease?  Or<br>
could that the 7-day sabbath would cease?  I think Sunday-keepers would not<br>
like the first interpretation.  And 7-day keepers would not agree with the<br>
second.  So how should this be interpreted?<br>

<i>&gt; . . . . .</i><br>
<p>
This passage is symbol of what happens when God's people rebel.  They<br>
were taken into captivity where they were slaves 7 days of the week.<br>
In Jeremiah we read of God's promise of a New Covenant, to forgive and<br>
to forgive and to restore His law to their hearts.  And indeed those<br>
who chose to were able to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild.  Then<br>
we see Paul re-applying these Covenants of the exhile to Christianity<br>
and this side of the cross.<br>
<p>
The theme of New Covenants is found throughout the OT.  God had a<br>
Covenant with Abraham, but Abraham died.  So a New Covenant with<br>
Isaac, and . . . . . .  At the time of Sinaii we see yet another<br>
New Covenant, now called the Old Covenant.  In the context of that<br>
Old Covenant we see that it was God's plan to place His law within<br>
their hearts.  But they rebelled and insisted on doing things their<br>
own way.  So their freedom to keep God's law was taken from them<br>
in captivity because of their rebellion.  But God promised yet another<br>
New Covenant . . . . . .<br>
<p>
I see Hosea 2:11 as symbol of rebellion and its consequences.  Those<br>
who rebell will loose their freedoms, even the freedom to keep God's<br>
law.  But even then God will strive to restore a people unto Himself,<br>
He will restore His promises in New Covenanants that are not all that<br>
new, simply restorations of old promises.<br>

Ah!  The animals are in the KJV!  The Greek uses the word ktisma, which<br>
means "created being" or "created thing."  Humans and celestial beings<br>
are called ktisma.  A good translation is: "everything that God created."<br>
<p>
An important principle of Bible interpretation is to draw conclusions on<br>
the basis of the whole Bible.  That means that any one text in isolation<br>
is not a good basis for doctrine.  One needs to look for everything the<br>
Bible says about the topic.  If I tell someone to turn on the TV and do<br>
not mention that first he should plug it in, am I saying that the TV can<br>
work without being plugged in?  That information is somewhere else--and<br>
quite probably in the mind of the one who is asked to turn on the TV.  The<br>
matter of clean and unclean is something like that.  If people know that<br>
clean animals are the ones to eat, speaking of all animals automatically<br>
<p>
triggers the "clean" idea in the mind.  But anyway, even if there is no<br>
reference to "clean animals" in Gen 9, it comes clearly in other passages.<br>

          I would like to make additional comments regarding the Luke<br>
      16 parable.  (Lazurus and the rich man), but first I wanted to<br>
      say that I have read several commentators regarding the John 14<br>
      v3 passage.  It certainly seems to say that when Jesus comes<br>
      again (second coming) that at that point he will receive us<br>
      to Himself.  This passage does pose a problem for the "soul/spirit<br>
      survives death" position.  I will look further into it.<br>
 <br>
   Steve Timm writes:<br>
<i>&gt; My thoughts on the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Let's suppose for a second that this parable is literally true.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "The beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom."</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; This doesn't mean that the beggar went straight to heaven.</i><br>
 <br>
   True, but it would seem to indicate that immediately after his death<br>
   he experienced some kind of consiousness.  Not necessarily heaven<br>
   but his was in a better position than the Rich Man.  It could not<br>
   likely be after the Resurrection for two reasons :<br>
 <br>
    1. There is nothing stating that after we are resurrected, that<br>
       we will be carried somewhere by angles.<br>
 <br>
    2. The Rich Man wants to return to tell his "still living brothers"<br>
       about the place of torment.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;"The rich man died, and was buried.  And in hell he lift up his eyes...</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Nor does it say that the rich man went to hell immediately</i><br>
 <br>
   If we can conclude that Lazurus' experience was after his death,<br>
   yet, prior to the resurrection, and his experience was taking place<br>
   the same time as the Rich Man, would we not conclude that the Rich<br>
   man's experience was immediatley after his death also ?<br>
   When the rich man wanted to return to tell his brothers so they<br>
   could avoid this place, Abraham, states that if they would not listen<br>
   to Moses and the prophets, they wouldn't listen to someone from the<br>
   dead.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;The communication which happens between Father Abraham and the rich man</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not impossible in hell as we know it, because Abraham stresses</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is a great gulf fixed.</i><br>
 <br>
   Without going into a detailed explanation of hell and hades, I<br>
   believe many would hold to an after death state and a final state.<br>
   I do not believe that the place where the Rich Man is, is the lake<br>
   of fire, referred to in Revelation.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Finally, nothing says that the rich man doesn't eventually burn up.</i><br>
 <br>
    True, but at the same time, it never states that he will.  If you<br>
    read this text, do you honestly get the impression that the rich<br>
    man will burn up ?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;So I think SDA's really have nothing to fear from this parable or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to explain it away.</i><br>
 <br>
    I would like to comment on this further, but lunch is over.<br>
 <br>

I am interested in knowing if the late James Arrabito produced any books or<br>
videos before his untimely death or if his widow has (I saw a photo of her<br>
at the ASI convention which suggested she was carrying on in some fashion)?<br>
If so, how might one obtain them?  Thx.<br>

If we accept that the Rich Man has somehow ended up in a place where he<br>
is conscious and that the time is before the resurrection and that he<br>
wants to talk to his living brothers (and Abraham thinks this is<br>
possible), then we must accept that this occurs to all (whether righteous<br>
or unrighteous) and that any one could do the same.  That would mean<br>
that the dead can indeed come and visit us and communicate with us.<br>
Scripture refers to these as "familiar spirits".  I leave it as an<br>
excercise for the reader to discover what the Scripture has to say about<br>
familiar spirits.  I Samuel 28 and I Chronicles 10:13 are just two of<br>
numerous references.<br>

I think we have significant evidence that the dead do not go immediately<br>
to heaven when we examine the account of the resurrection of Jesus.  John<br>
20:17 Jesus said to Mary Magdalene, "Touch me not; for I am not ascended to<br>
my Father:  but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my<br>
Father, and you Father, and to my God, and your God."  If Jesus had been<br>
in heaven with God the Father during his 3 days of physical death, he<br>
would not have said he had not been to his Father's yet.  Following this,<br>
Mary went and told His disciples that he had risen from the grave and<br>
He lated appeared to them in the upper room.  When Thomas disbelieved,<br>
Jesus told him to touch His wounds and thrust his finger into His side.<br>
Obviously something must have transpired between appearance to Mary and<br>
appearance to Thomas.  Mary was forbidden to touch him.  Thomas was<br>
encouraged to do so.  So where was the spirit of Jesus while he was in<br>
the tomb?  Obviously not with God the Father (i.e., in heaven).<br>
<p>
Yet, Jesus was not of normal human body after the resurrection for he<br>
was perceived as a spirit and could appear out of nowhere and then<br>
disappear into nowhere.  He did not do this before his crucifixion.  But<br>
he did have a physical body that could be touched.  There was obviously<br>
a transformation of some type at the resurrection.<br>
<p>
It's unfortunate that the Gospels do not specify what Lazarus, the brother<br>
of Mary and Martha, said after he was resurrected by Jesus.  However, it<br>
appears that the resurrection of Lazarus (and Jarius' daughter, and son<br>
of the widow of Nain) were of a different type than that of Jesus.  For<br>
they were not raised in an immortal body and in fact, did suffer death<br>
again.  Too bad the scriptures don't tell us anything about whether they<br>
were conscious during their state of lifelessness.  Paul tells us that<br>
the fact of Jesus' resurrection is proof that He has conquered death.<br>
The resurrections of Lazarus and others were clearly NOT a conquering of<br>
death but a mere reuniting of the spirit with body.  They were not<br>
resurrected as transformed beings as Christ was.<br>

Dave's interpretation of this verse certainly sounds plausible. However, I<br>
have one problem with it.  Other verses in the Bible which use the same<br>
Hebrew word clearly indicate that "to cease" is permanent rather than<br>
temporary.  Examples:<br>
<p>
Daniel 9:26,27 - And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off,<br>
but not for himself, and the people of the prince that shall come shall<br>
destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a<br>
flood, and unto the end of the war desolatiions are determined.  And he shall<br>
confirm the convenant with many for one week:  and in the midst of the week<br>
he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.<br>
<p>
Hosea 1:4 - And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a<br>
little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu,<br>
and will cause to cease the kinghom of the house of Israel.<br>
<p>
Deuteronomy 32:26 - I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make<br>
the remembrance of them to cease from among men.<br>
<p>
Genesis 9:22 - While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and<br>
heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall NOT cease.<br>
<p>
Clearly, all these verses signify a permanent cessation, not something<br>
temporary.  Thus, if the verse in Hosea 2 which says he will cause her<br>
sabbaths to cease, would this not signify a permanent cessation of the<br>
observance of Sabbath?<br>

When interpreting the book of Hosea, we need to view it in the historical<br>
contest of God's dealings with the northern kingdom of Israel.  Shortly<br>
after the book of Hosea was written, Israel was taken into captivity<br>
by Assyria. The new moons, sabbaths, and feast days did in fact cease.<br>
The Sabbath continued, only Israel lost its opportunity to observe it<br>
because they were unfaithful.  God speaks of taking these blessings <br>
away from Israel because Israel did not recognize that they had their<br>
source in God.  As far as we know, most of the northern kingdom never<br>
returned from captivity.<br>
<p>
This text is to be contrasted with such passages as Isaiah 66:23,<br>
"From one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another,<br>
shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord."<br>

<i>&gt; I am interested in knowing if the late James Arrabito produced any books or</i><br>
<i>&gt; videos before his untimely death or if his widow has (I saw a photo of her</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the ASI convention which suggested she was carrying on in some fashion)?</i><br>
<i>&gt; If so, how might one obtain them?  Thx.</i><br>
<p>
We have received circular type letters from his wife from time to time<br>
indicating that she is working to complete at least some of his<br>
projects that were researched in his trip around the world to gather<br>
stories and video footage of historic early hundreds AD Sabbath keeping.<br>
I have not received any notice that its available, but then its been<br>
a few months.  Seems like its time for an update.<br>

I have not seen anyone mention that the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus <br>
predates Christ. It is known that a Rabbinic story had floated around before <br>
Christ that has the rich man in Abraham's bosom and the beggar in hell. Could <br>
it be that Jesus took a well known story and gave it a twist. His goal was to <br>
teach that being successful in this life does not garantee heaven. His goal is<br>
not to teach the correct doctrine of life and death.<br>

"I'm curious about how you interpret Hosea 2:11.  Hosea is clearly symbolic<br>
of the way the Lord relates to his fallen church.  This verse says, "I will<br>
also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, and her new moons, and<br>
her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts."  If Sabbath celebration was to<br>
last through eternity, how do you interpret this?  The feast days, new moons,<br>
and solemn feasts of Judaism have ceased.  Does this really mean that the<br>
all important sabbath, the sign of his chosen people would also cease?  Or<br>
could that the 7-day sabbath would cease?  I think Sunday-keepers would not<br>
like the first interpretation.  And 7-day keepers would not agree with the<br>
second.  So how should this be interpreted?"<br>
<p>
In context these statements apply to God rejecting His people because they <br>
have rejected Him. It does not say He will take these things away from His <br>
followers, but rather from those who have ceased to follow Him. God provided <br>
all of the things mentioned to be a blessing to His people and now He is <br>
withholding these blessings.<br>

As I reflect back on last month, where I posted two or three articles in the <br>
"Good News And Happy Things" thread, a couple things stick out.<br>
<p>
1)  I was still backhanded and critical enough to cause controversy with <br>
a couple of those posts.<br>
<p>
2)  Nobody gave a positive response or posted any good news of their own.<br>
In fact, we were strictly admonished "Woe unto you when all men shall speak<br>
well of you."  <br>
<p>
How much greater is the woe when NO man, not even among ourselves, can say <br>
a good word for God, for the church, for the list, for the neighbors,<br>
nothing.  Is anyone out there happy?  Do you know the joy of the Lord?<br>
When was the last time you just woke up in the morning and sang a song of <br>
praise to God?  Has God been working mightily in your life?  If so, don't <br>
be afraid to let the net know.<br>
<p>
Perhaps this is an uphill battle, because the main function of SDA-L is for <br>
this, and of the ten messages it has had so far this year, five are from me.<br>
It seems a little cynical to think that the reason SDAnet has traffic is that<br>
we SDA's thrive on controversy and dispute.  Do we have a macabre<br>
satisfaction in focusing only on the problems in the church?  Do we<br>
think that the incredible ways that God is working in the world are<br>
somehow not newsworthy.<br>
<p>
Let the controversy go on.  Keep on debating.  I like it as much as<br>
anyone else.  But please, let's not forget to say a good word for God on<br>
occasion.<br>
One area of the list that I am happy to see is the number of posts<br>
relating to doctrinal discussion.  It's up remarkably over the last<br>
couple months,<br>
and I hope it stays that way.  Also, SDAnet will soon pass the 100-reader<br>
mark  (the combined readership of the two nets stands at 127).  <br>
<p>
I just praise God that He sees fit to use this list in whatever way is<br>
needed, I pray it will continue.<br>

David, And here I thought you would appreciate the story of the apple tree<br>
and now you are taking issue with it!! &lt;smile!&gt;<br>
<p>
In my ministry I have observed the ones who think the Lord will give them<br>
the victory in due time or someday are the ones practicing Salvation by<br>
works only.<br>
<p>
A person who accepts Christ by faith has the asurrance. IJohn 5 makes that<br>
very clear. And I might say, he has the asurrance of victory in his life.<br>
Good works will be produced in the life -- a life of obedience -- but it<br>
has nothing to do with salvation. Some SDAs through the years have become<br>
so obsessed with the law and salvation by works only, that as EGW says,<br>
they have become as dry as the hill of Gilboa.<br>
<p>
I believe that the the apple tree illustration gives the message a<br>
certain sound -- a good sound. Applying to life it simple says that we do<br>
good works because we are saved not because we are trying to be saved.<br>
Venden is right on target!<br>
<p>
Matthew 9:14-17 has a tremendous message for us. It is time for us to<br>
start putting the new wine into new winebags. Some talk about the new<br>
theology! It was Jesus himself that had new theology -- and that is why<br>
he blew the socks off of the church leaders. We need to in my opinion<br>
leave the old ways and learn the ways of Jesus.<br>
<p>
I did not intend to have such a lengthy message David, I guess I felt a<br>
sermon coming on!! &lt;&lt;Grin!&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
God bless,<br>
<p>
Paul<br>

<i>&gt; I have not seen anyone mention that the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus </i><br>
<i>&gt; predates Christ. It is known that a Rabbinic story had floated around before </i><br>
<i>&gt; Christ that has the rich man in Abraham's bosom and the beggar in hell. Could </i><br>
<i>&gt; it be that Jesus took a well known story and gave it a twist. His goal was to </i><br>
<i>&gt; teach that being successful in this life does not garantee heaven. His goal is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not to teach the correct doctrine of life and death.</i><br>
<p>
Here is what I found in the Interpreters Bible which claims 146 editors  and<br>
consulting editors.  To save you time I'll just glean a few highlights:<br>
<p>
     Two distinct themes - reversal of values in life to come and poor  will<br>
     be rewarded and the rich punished.<br>
<p>
     "19-31. Parable of the Rich Man and the Beggar -- (See also . . . .  .)<br>
     This story was the spark that touched off the revolution in the life of<br>
     Albert Schweitzer.  He concluded that Africa  was  a  beggar  lying  at<br>
     Europe's  doorstep,  so he founded the Lambarene Hospital.  The parable<br>
     has that kind of power. . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
     "This parable is not theology.  It is a vivid story, not  a  Baedeker's<br>
     guide  to  the next world.  Such stories as this were current in Jesus'<br>
     day.  They are found in rabbinical sources, and even in Egyptian papyri<br>
     (see  Exeg.).  The  climate of the story is almost that of the play The<br>
     Green Pastures. But we cannot be casual with it, for  its  symbols  are<br>
     the  shadows  of realities.  It tells us that inequalities on earth are<br>
     redressed in heaven: lowliness (Lazarus means "God helps") is  rewarded<br>
     hereafter, and self- indulgent pride is rebuked.  We all see that self-<br>
     ishness makes hell on earth: why should we doubt that  it  brings  hell<br>
     hereafter?   The  story  tells  us of a great gulf.  If a man chooses a<br>
     cheap heaven here, he can hardly expect to have a  real  heaven  beyond<br>
     death, for he has lost both taste and aptitude for a real heaven.  If a<br>
     man lives without compassion, he manifestly digs a chasm  between  him-<br>
     self  and  his  fellow  men; and by the same token he separates himself<br>
     from God, for God is love.  The story tells us that life here  fashions<br>
     an eternal destiny."<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
	Heres a question I would like to get your opinion about.<br>
<p>
Which do you think it would be more correct to say; when one is converted<br>
one is saved (full stop) OR one is on the path of salvation ?<br>
<p>
There is a very important yet subtle distinction here.<br>
<p>

I am sure that this issue has come up from time to time, but<br>
now that I am confronting this issue at my own church, I need<br>
to find some answers.<br>
<p>
Should the eligibility of a member to the church board be<br>
dependent on the level of financial commitment he/she makes<br>
to his/her local church?<br>
<p>
Some background: the church is in a state of flux, with the <br>
older members having to accept the involvement of newer<br>
members. The older members would like to step down and let<br>
the younger ones take over, but there are some who are unhappy<br>
with the types of people who are taking over, that the church<br>
is sliding away from its fundamentalist groundwork. They<br>
feel a need to _take back_ their church and bring it back<br>
to the way things used to be. <br>
<p>
Thus, that faction has begun to question the latest round of<br>
nominations to the church board, and have used the tithe issue<br>
as a litmus test of commitment to the church. They reason that,<br>
because the church has been steadily losing money due to eroding<br>
attendance on a weekly basis and the church's inability to keep<br>
pace with escalating maintenance costs, they need to make sure<br>
that its higher-ups make a dual commitment, spiritually and<br>
financially, to its church. <br>
<p>
Is this a reasonable prereq? I had always thought that your <br>
relationship with God is a private matter, and the level of<br>
financial commitment, tithes and offerings, is something that<br>
should not be discussed outside of the boardroom. <br>
<p>
I hope I don't ruin a good thread out there. I've enjoyed your<br>
discussions over the last few weeks and am thankful to hear<br>
that such a group exists for SDA thoughts. Thanks and God bless<br>
you for your help in advance.<br>

<p>
I'd say the latter.  Coverting to follow Jesus sets you on the path.  If you <br>
should die while on the path, then you are saved.  If you are on the path <br>
when Jesus returns, then you are saved.  Should you lose faith and stray<br>
from the path, then you are not.  <br>
<p>
I suppose one could say that unless you are perfect, then you are not truly<br>
converted, but in my opinion, that's a cynical view of things.  Even the <br>
apostles, who walked in Jesus' footsteps, had their failings and doubts.  I<br>
find it hard to believe that more would be expected from us who live 2000<br>
years after those footsteps left the Earth than was expected from those first<br>
disciples.<br>
<p>
Trust in the Lord to do with you that which is just.  In the form I have now,<br>
physical and spiritual, I do not deserve to be in His prescence.  All I can<br>
do is pray that whatever His will is for me, then let it be done, and that<br>
He change me to be what He wants me to be.  If that 'future me' is unrecognizable<br>
to the 'present me', then praise God, for the 'present me' is unworthy.<br>
<p>
May the Lord bless you all...<br>

<i>&gt;   dead can indeed come and visit us and communicate with us.</i><br>
 <br>
      I have to disagree with Fred's reasoning.  After reading this<br>
    parable, its obvious that the rich man "cannot" return to warn<br>
    his brothers.  Otherwise, he most certainly would have.  The only<br>
    point that I believe Abraham is making is that even if he could,<br>
    and we conclude that he can't, that his brothers hearts are probably<br>
    so hardened, that even if someone did come back from the dead, they<br>
    still wouldn't repent.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;   Scripture refers to these as "familiar spirits".  I leave it</i><br>
<i>&gt;   as an excercise for the reader to discover what the Scripture</i><br>
<i>&gt;   has to say about familiar spirits.  I Samuel 28 and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Chronicles 10:13 are just two of numerous references.</i><br>
 <br>
    I am in 100% agreement with Fred, that any attempt to contact the<br>
    dead is an abomination to the Lord and strongly advised against.<br>

In reading the discussion over Hosea's warning about the end of the<br>
new moons celebrations, feast days, and sabbaths, I haven't seen it<br>
brought up as to the possibility that this is not talking about THE<br>
WEEKLY Sabbath...<br>
 <br>
Weren't some of those feast days, etc. also called sabbaths, even though<br>
they were not WEEKLY Sabbaths?  I've always assumed that this text<br>
talked about the end of the celebration of the feasts, but not the Sabbath<br>
that came every week.  Although, as has been pointed out, those who went<br>
into captivity couldn't celebrate either kind.<br>
 <br>
I'd be happy to hear along these lines from someone who knows more than<br>
I do about it!<br>

<i>&gt;  .....    So where was the spirit of Jesus while he was in</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Obviously not with God the Father (i.e., in heaven).</i><br>
 <br>
      If we look at the last words Jesus uttered from his lips,<br>
    we will find where His spirit went.  In Luke 23:46, He says<br>
    "Father, into Thy hands I commit my spirit".<br>
 <br>
      This is echoed by Stephen just before his death in Acts 7:59<br>
    He says "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit".<br>
 <br>
       Many have proposed that during Jesus death, he descended into<br>
    Hades and released the "spirits in prison". Or at least made<br>
    a proclamation of some sort.  They use the 1 Peter 3:19 as a proof<br>
    text.  After much research regarding 1 Pet. 3:19, I do not believe<br>
    that this passage refers to Jesus during His 3-day period after<br>
    the Crucifixion and before His Resurrection.  Wayne Grudem has a<br>
    commentary on 1 Peter and it contains a lengthy appendix dedicated<br>
    soley to 1 Peter 3:19.  It is the best reading on this passage I've<br>
    come across.  What I believe 1 Peter says in a paraphrase is this:<br>
 <br>
      Jesus was made alive (resurrected) in the spirit.  The very same<br>
    spirit that He also preached through Noah back during the time the<br>
    the Ark was built.  The preaching was to disobedient humans, who<br>
    had long since passed away and were now spirits in prison.<br>
    The preaching took place thru Noah, back when the Ark was being<br>
    built.<br>
 <br>
      You may disagree with this position, but I have read many<br>
    possible interpretations of this verse and the above is what I<br>
    personally believe is the most accurate.  In Wayne Grudem's appendix<br>
    he systematically deals with all the possible interpretations and<br>
    and gives solid reasons for his position.<br>
 <br>
      Back to the original question.  Where was Jesus between His<br>
    Crucifixion and Resuurection ?  I'm not certain there is enough<br>
    biblical evidence to form any concluding answer.   But, like stated<br>
    before, He gave His spirit into His Father's hands right before<br>
    He died.  It is quite possible that His spirit was with His Father<br>
    during that time until His Resurrection, at which time His trans-<br>
    formed physical body was made alive and once again His spirit was<br>
    present in His body.<br>
 <br>
    Good question Cheryl.....ok I'd love to here from Steve Timm<br>
    and Scott Mattes on this one.  (smile guys)...<br>

A favorite illustration I get from those espousing once-saved-always-saved<br>
is that being 'saved' means adopted into the family.  Once a son or<br>
daughter, God is not going to throw us out of the household.<br>
<p>
Now lets imagine you are the parents of an adopted son.  You take him to<br>
the doctor because he is very ill.  The doctor takes you asside and<br>
whispers in your ear -- "the reason your son is near unto death is that<br>
he no longer wants to be your son".   You can be a son and member of<br>
the family, yet sick unto death because of sin.<br>
<p>
I have offered the parable of the prodigal son to illustrate that you<br>
can be a son, dis-own your sonship, and return again.  But they insist<br>
the son was not 'saved' into the family until he returned from the hogs.<br>
He did not really become a 'son' until after he threw his sonship<br>
asside.  Somehow I cannot buy that line of reasoning that says you<br>
cannot be 'saved' until you have rejected God for a spell.  But then<br>
you are saved such that nothing you do can un-save you.<br>
<p>
I recently received a book by Jack Sequeira.  Leafing through the<br>
book I found a table of over a page in length.  The left hand column<br>
illustrates Justification and offers texts.  The right hand column<br>
illustrates the related points of Sanctification and offers texts.<br>
Those who wish to insist that we are Justified (full stop period)<br>
for salvation are insisting on ignoring the abundance of texts that<br>
talk about sanctification.  We are not the ones who sanctify ourselves.<br>
It is by the power of God and the blood and example of Jesus Christ.<br>

Eric Snyder is trying to make the point that Christ's Spirit returned to <br>
God at his death.  This is a point on which Adventists agree.  The spirits<br>
of everyone return to God at death (Eccl 12:7).  What we disagree on <br>
is the question of what the spirit comprises.  In particular, does the <br>
post-death spirit form a conscious intelligent entity outside of or <br>
apart from the body?  To answer these questions we must turn to the large <br>
volume of texts, including the words of Christ referring to death as a sleep.<br>
These indicate that while the spirit may be with God, it is not conscious.<br>
<p>
The spirit could well be described as the backup tape of the character<br>
of an individual.<br>

<i>&gt; nominations to the church board, and have used the tithe issue</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a litmus test of commitment to the church. They reason that,</i><br>
<p>
Here in the Oregon Conference the Conference President has basically<br>
declared war on independent ministries.  Less than full tithing support<br>
of the Conference can cost you your offices in the church -- I happen<br>
to be on a church nominating committee this year.<br>
<p>
Here is my finding after reading available EGW material and the Bible:<br>
<p>
 * We should send our tithe through the proper channels.<br>
<p>
 * If the proper channels are miss appropriating the tithes we should<br>
   protest to those in charge.<br>
<p>
 * If that does not remedy the problem we are accountable for what<br>
   happens to God's money from our income.  That may mean sending<br>
   our tithe to God's work outside of the established channels.  For<br>
   example EGWs 1905 dated letter to a conference president -- She<br>
   said she was sending her money to black pastors in the south<br>
   who were not being properly supported.  She accepted other peoples<br>
   tithe to forward to certain projects and gave a detailed accounting.<br>
<p>
 * Sometimes her tithing outside of proper channels was less a<br>
   protest of missappropriation but rather sending tithe to tithe<br>
   appropriate projects that the proper channels were unresponsive<br>
   to, or the committee process would have taken too long.<br>
<p>
 * If we are not happy with how our tithe is being spent we should<br>
   not withold our tithe.<br>
<p>
 * Not even conference presidents have any business trying to dictate<br>
   your conscience on tithing.  I should not condemn you for sending<br>
   your tithe to the conference.  I should not condemn you for not<br>
   sending your tithe to the conference.  Nor should the conference<br>
   president, the church pastor or the nominating committee.<br>
<p>
 * It is no light matter to decide to send your tithe outside of<br>
   the established channels and to decide where to send it.  Much<br>
   careful study and prayer must go into establishing personal<br>
   criteria.<br>
<p>
 * Tithe money should never be spent on ones own personal ministry.<br>
   For example a youth pastor who spent his tithe for gas money for<br>
   the Youth Van, costumes for an upcoming play he was writing,<br>
   . . . . . .<br>
<p>
Perhaps I should type up the relevant quotes, letters and texts and<br>
post them to SDAnet?  Tithing is simply too important to rest with<br>
my stated observations about what I have read.<br>

<i>&gt; Thus, that faction has begun to question the latest round of</i><br>
<i>&gt; nominations to the church board, and have used the tithe issue</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a litmus test of commitment to the church. They reason that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; because the church has been steadily losing money due to eroding</i><br>
<i>&gt; attendance on a weekly basis and the church's inability to keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; pace with escalating maintenance costs, they need to make sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; that its higher-ups make a dual commitment, spiritually and</i><br>
<i>&gt; financially, to its church. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is this a reasonable prereq? I had always thought that your </i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship with God is a private matter, and the level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; financial commitment, tithes and offerings, is something that</i><br>
<i>&gt; should not be discussed outside of the boardroom. </i><br>
<p>
This church sounds pretty sick.  Isn't tithe information supposed to<br>
be secret in the first place?<br>
<p>
Even if it's public, judging people on such a basis smacks of<br>
salvation by works.<br>
<p>
Even if you consider judging on the basis of tithe to be OK, you would<br>
need information on the person's salary to do it fairly, else a<br>
plastic surgeon making $200K would wipe out a ditch digger making<br>
$20K.  Is the plastic surgeon more valuable to the church (probably<br>
LESS valuable in reality).<br>

<i>&gt; Should the eligibility of a member to the church board be</i><br>

<p>
It depends on how the "litmus test" is used.  It is reasonable<br>
for board members to be expected to fulfill the obligation of<br>
returning a "faithful tithe" to the church.  After all, board<br>
members are (or should be) examples for the congregation.<br>
<p>
However, a faithful tithe is, by definition, 10%.  If a church<br>
member makes $1000 a month, his/her tithe is $100.  If he/she<br>
is indeed contributing that, then no one can say that he/she<br>
is not living up to a financial commitment just because he/she<br>
is not one of the churches highest contributors.  Indeed, that <br>
person could be rightly said to have done more than the person<br>
making $10,000 a month that contributes $1000, as the latter <br>
will still have far more means to live on than the former, and<br>
will have made much less of a sacrifice, relatively speaking.<br>
<p>
Churches should take care in saying that board members must be<br>
the greatest contributors of funds, as that makes for a board <br>
that is comprised solely by the wealthiest members.<br>

Steve was encouraging some good news.  All right!  The May 7 Adventist Review<br>
had an encouraging article on Revelation seminars in Romania, so if you have<br>
not read it, I urge you to do so.<br>
<p>
And now, here's some news from Richard Wilcox, GC Euro-Asia Affairs dept.<br>
We receive this newsletter since we have been supporting various projects.<br>
Typos are mine.  [Bracketted comments mine.]<br>
<p>
April, 1992<br>
<p>
I have been back from my last trip to the former Soviet Union<br>
now for about three days, so I must get this report<br>
off to you.  There are many thrilling items to share with you,<br>
how God's hand is over our brothers and sisters in the Commonwealth of<br>
Independent States.  The Gospel is going forward speedily in this<br>
vast land.  You dear people who are giving so generously and<br>
sacrificially of your means, as well as your prayers, are making<br>
this possible.<br>
<p>
As I write this report, Elder Mark Finley has finished his<br>
evangelistic campaign in the Kremlin--yes the Kremlin.  Just think,<br>
less than four months ago we were watching the unfolding [??] of the<br>
coup leaders in the great hall of the Kremlin in Moscow.  Now from<br>
that same platform Mark has been sharing the love of Jesus Christ<br>
with from ten to twelve thousand people every day.  The auditorium<br>
will only seat 6,000 opeople so he has gone to two meetings a day<br>
right from the very start.  By God's grace we have baptized over<br>
1400 precious souls as a result of these meetings.  From these<br>
meetings we will be forming at least three new churches.<br>
<p>
We also have two other evangelistic programs going on.  One in<br>
Chernovtsy, which is in the southwest corner of the Ukraine and one<br>
in Vladivostok which is in the far southeastern corner [still pretty far north]<br>
of the Russian Replublic, right up above Japan.  With all of the programs<br>
being help by outside evangelists [e.g., Quiet Hour] and the local follow-up<br>
meetings, we are projecting over 150 evangelistic campaigns in the<br>
Commonwealth of the Independent Sates in 1992.<br>
<p>
Elder Folkenberg is now on his trip to this vast country.  We<br>
have dedicated the medical clinic in Moscow, the publishing house<br>
in Zaokski, and part of the new dormitory and chapel at the<br>
seminary.  We will only have limited operations at the publishing<br>
house with everything else coming on-line a little later in<br>
the summer.  When everything is finished at the Medical Center in<br>
Moscow, we will be offering dental, physical rehabilitation, and<br>
health education.  Dr Carter is our first dentist.  He arrived<br>
April 20, and the health education and physical medicine [staff?] will<br>
follow soon.<br>
<p>
ADRA is in the midst of a tremendous program with the US<br>
Department of Agriculture to provide food and humanitarian help<br>
to eight cities out in the Urals, which is in the south central part<br>
of the Russian Republic.  They will have two convoys of 400 trucks<br>
each that will be bringing food in from a port in Germany.<br>
Altogether they will be providing 12,000 tons of food to these dear<br>
people for that area.  If this goes well, which [sic] we are confident<br>
that it will, the US government has indicated there will be many<br>
more projects of this type.<br>
<p>
Our construction moves slowly but by God's grace it moves<br>
ahead.  With the central government gone, approval to build<br>
comes very slow.  We also find it very hard to get the materials to build<br>
in many areas.  We presently have over 127 churches either under<br>
construction; or in some cases, we are purchasing and renovating<br>
established buildings.  We also have quite a few church buildings<br>
that are finishing up now that started as far back as two years<br>
ago.  We are still very hopeful that Maranatha will be able to<br>
be involved with us and take on some projects there, so that we can<br>
get churches finished much faster.  I will be visiting southern<br>
California to meet with an architectural firm that has developed a<br>
very light and inexpensive building material that can expedite the<br>
way we build.<br>
<p>
We have a business man, Peter Koolik, who is a general contractor<br>
from Australia and he has moved his family to Russia for one<br>
to two years.  He will be heading up all of the construction in<br>
the Zaokski and Moscow areas.  We know this will be a major break-<br>
through to help really get this phase of our work underway.<br>
<p>
I know I run the risk of leaving someone out when I do this<br>
but, I want to give special recognition to all of the employees of<br>
the Chesapeake Conference.  They wanted a special project at<br>
Christmas time so they decided to give their Christmas bonuses [??]<br>
to put stained glass windows in the the new chapel at the seminary.  I<br>
know this will be a lasting memorial to their desire to help these<br>
dear people.<br>
<p>
The need for Bibles, both adult and children's, along with<br>
other literature continues to be very pressing.  As we dedicate the<br>
publishing house in late April, we will then be able on a limited<br>
basis, to begin providing this help in a more timely way;  but the<br>
cost to do this goes up every day.  Our paper and supplies will be<br>
many times more costly than they were even a few months ago.<br>
However, with your continued support, I know God will help us to<br>
meet the needs of our church in this great country.<br>
<p>
I stood outside the church in Moscow and watched the young<br>
people going in carrying their Bibles under their arms.  I realized<br>
how proud they are to have their own Bible.  We ordered 25,000 of<br>
the Children's Bible in mid-1991 and distributed them to every<br>
Adventist home in the entire Division that has young people ages 2<br>
to 15.  However, the supply of books is exhausted, so we need to<br>
order more.<br>
<p>
None of the work from many of the evangelistic campaigns and<br>
building churches to providing Bibles and literature by the<br>
thousands would be possible without the dedication and sacrificial <br>
giving of each and every one of you.  We at the Euro-Asia Affairs<br>
office, as we are now called, want you to know how much we<br>
appreciate your support.<br>
<p>
May the love, peace, and grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ<br>
be with you one and all.<br>
<p>
Your servants at the General Conference,<br>
(signed)<br>

Most of what I see in the Bible implies that the only prequisite to<br>
salvation is asking for it.  I think we get into trouble, however, if we<br>
assume that once the assurance of salvation is ours, that there is<br>
nothing else to do <br>
in the Christian life.<br>
<p>
Even if there were no heaven, and we knew with certainty that good and<br>
bad alike were all going to burn in hell, God's way is still the best<br>
way to live<br>
here and now.  And it is only as we live the life with a disinterest in our<br>
own salvation and a large interest in loving God and others that we are truly<br>
living unselfishly.<br>
<p>
To summarize<br>
1)  God gives us ample assurance of salvation so we don't need to spend<br>
our lives worrying about it.<br>
<p>
2)  Salvation is the beginning, not the end result of the Christian<br>
experience.  A life lived just to get oneself into heaven is by<br>
definition <br>
selfish.  The selfless Christian will not be concerned with his own<br>
salvation, focusing rather on the needs of others.  (Witness Moses'<br>
willingness to have his name blotted out of the book of life.)<br>

The Church Manual, 1990 edition, p. 133, reads:  "Conference workers and church elders and other officers and institutional leaders are to recognize that as a<br>
principle of leadership in God's work, that a good example is to be set in the<br>
matter of returning tithe.  No one shall be continued as either a church officer<br>
or conference worker who does not conform to this standard of leadership."<br>
<p>
This may shed light on the problem.<br>

<i>&gt; Which do you think it would be more correct to say; when one is converted</i><br>
<i>&gt; one is saved (full stop) OR one is on the path of salvation ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; There is a very important yet subtle distinction here.</i><br>
<p>
When we get down to nuances of language, differences of interpretation, of<br>
connotation creep in, thereby increasing the likelihood that we may not<br>
all understand your wording in the same way.<br>
<p>
Permit me to rewrite your question as "Can one say the he/she has eternal<br>
life, or does one say one is on the path to eternal life?".  Let's then<br>
look at Scripture.  Using grep as the "weapon" 8-) (sword of the Spirit)<br>
to search for the occurence of "eternal" and "life" in the same verses:<br>
Nothing in the OT, but the NT includes these:<br>
<p>
MAR 10:30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.<br>
JOH 3:15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.<br>
JOH 4:36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.<br>
JOH 5:39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.<br>
JOH 6:54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.<br>
JOH 10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.<br>
JOH 12:25 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.<br>
JOH 17:2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.<br>
JOH 17:3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.<br>
ACT 13:48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.<br>
ROM 2:7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:<br>
ROM 5:21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>
ROM 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>
TI1 6:12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.<br>
TI1 6:19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.<br>
TIT 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;<br>
TIT 3:7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<br>
JO1 1:2 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)<br>
JO1 2:25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.<br>
JO1 3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.<br>
JO1 5:11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.<br>
JO1 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.<br>
JO1 5:20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.<br>
JUD 1:21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.<br>
<p>
I note that several speak of having eternal life *right now* (1Jn5:13 being<br>
the most outstanding, but severals others in John's epistle speak equally<br>
strongly).  Eternal life is a gift (!! not earned), Rom 6:23, et al.  Paul<br>
in Titus urges us to grab hold and hang on tightly (so as not to cast it<br>
away, Heb 10:35).  It is discovered (by reading with faith) in the Scriptures<br>
and coming to know Christ as Savior *and* Lord.  It is also a promise that<br>
is fulfilled at the second coming (1Cor15:53,54).<br>
<p>
Suppose my parents were among the landed and moneyed.  Suppose at my birth<br>
they start tucking away major sums of money into prudent mutual funds.<br>
Suppose they say the money will become mine when I turn 21 years old.  While<br>
I have not received it yet, the money is most surely mine now because of the<br>
sure word of their promise that it will be mine.  (Ignoring, for the sake of<br>
the story, how even prudent investments can turn sour)  There are only<br>
three ways I could lose out:<br>
1)  They could disinherit me (but God, who does not lie, has promised not to);<br>
2)  I could die beforehand (not an issue here; temporal metaphors do not<br>
    always map 1-to-1  8-);<br>
3)  I could spurn it (in which case the fault is all mine and none of theirs).<br>
<p>
We are justified by faith in Christ's atoning/reconciling sacrifice (Hab2:4b).<br>
We are to grow in grace (2Pe3:18), sanctifying holy character (Jos3:5, Joel2,<br>
which God has pledged to do in us, Lev20:7,8, 1Th5:23, by the indwelling of<br>
the Holy Spirit, Eph3:16).<br>
<p>
Perhaps it is best summed up in the words of Hanani to King Asa:<br>
    CH2 16:9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth,<br>
    to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect [i.e.,<br>
    whose heart holds nothing back] toward him.<br>
God is looking for people who hold nothing back from Him, who acknowledge<br>
His Lordship in every part of their lives.<br>

Hi all<br>
<p>
	Ok I hear you all loud and clear. I was not really refering<br>
to the once-saved-always-saved issue. I am rather trying to solidify<br>
in my own mind exactly how salvation works in this respect.<br>
<p>
	When we experience conversion I know that salvation is awarded us<br>
immediately, but we don't receive it in its fullness at that moment. <br>
Salvation in all its glorious fullness is really received only at the <br>
2nd coming ( ie savation from both sin and evil ). Isa (?) and EGW tell us <br>
that on conversion we start a journey along the path of righteousness<br>
a steep, narrow and perilous path which ultimately leads us to the New<br>
Jerusalem. "The path of the just is as a shining light that shineth more<br>
and more unto the perfect day" This journey can end for us at the very door<br>
of the New Jerusalem or by death (or by choice, however this cancels the <br>
salvation). <br>
So in this sense salvation is not received until that day in the New Jerusalem. <br>
<p>
So I suppose the question comes down to this does salvation mean the<br>
end or the beginning of the journey. Steve thinks its the latter. <br>
Some of EGW's statements regarding this make me feel the prior my be true.<br>
( again: we get to the end of the journey by sticking to it until we either<br>
die or Jesus comes. This has nothing to do with legalism)<br>
<p>
Do we have any consensus about which definition is more appropriate ?<br>
<p>
Ruben<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Nancy V.</i><br>
<p>
Yesterday I received a letter from Don Jacobson, President of the Oregon<br>
Conference.  He was writing to answer the questions I had asked him.<br>
Regarding the policy of witholding offices to those who send any of<br>
their tithes outside the conference -- He said it its Church Manual policy<br>
and his own personal oppinion is not what matters.  I had heard that<br>
Joe Crews was no longer welcome in the Oregon Conference.  Don Jacobson<br>
wrote to me that Joe Crews is still welcome in the Oregon Conference<br>
because he continues to return all tithes sent to him.  He happens to<br>
be a bit out of date.  But thats the policy.  Any independent ministry<br>
they know of that accepts tithe is verboten.  Tye (sp?) Gibson was<br>
an example of an independent ministry determined to be not acceptable.<br>
He recently published a letter announcing that he will no longer accept<br>
tithes.  Soon after that we started receiving meeting notices that he<br>
is to be speaking at several churches in the Oregon Conference.<br>
<p>
Someone I know well, whom I'll not identify, has been for years a head<br>
elder, SS teacher etc.  But some of his tithe goes other than to the<br>
Oregon Conference.  He is on the nominating committee this year at his<br>
church.  The policy was stated by the pastor at the beginning of the<br>
nominating.  So he asked the pastor if he should turn down all his<br>
offices and nominations.  The pastor's reply was YES!<br>
<p>
I guess its not Conference Policy but the church manual from which<br>
these actions spring.<br>

If the pastor's reply was as abrupt as that, his handling of the situation<br>
was not wise.  While Mat 18:15 and Gal 6:1 speak of slightly different<br>
situations, the pastor would have been wise to apply to himself the underlying<br>
principles of these verses re a proper, Godly attitude and spirit.<br>
<p>
As for the person, God promises to "dump a semi load" of grace (Jam 4:6,<br>
1Pet 5:5) into that situation so that he can respond in a Christlike way<br>
(as in 1Pet 2:20:<br>
    For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall<br>
    take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take<br>
    it patiently, this is acceptable with God.)<br>

First, a disclaimer:<br>
<p>
It is the policy of the editorship of SDAnet to encourage tithes to be<br>
paid through the appropriate channels.  SDAnet does not now, nor has it<br>
ever,<br>
called for tithes to be paid to itself or any other independent ministry.<br>
<p>
Now that the legal hassle is out of the way:<br>
<p>
For years tithing was enforced by making it sound like one of the many<br>
things required for salvation.  Also it has been encouraged by stories<br>
of people who pay their tithe and the rain came and fell only on their<br>
farm, etc.<br>
(I always wondered why we never heard stories of those who gave their tithe<br>
but still died in the drought, maybe because these people never live to<br>
tell about it.)  Now there is a renewed emphasis on what has long been<br>
church policy perhaps because the other two arguments have become less<br>
effective.<br>
Tithing came as truth to SDA's fairly late in the game, mid-1870's to<br>
late 1880's.  <br>
<p>
When the Illinois conference officers came to my church for a town<br>
meeting, they spent 90 minutes of their two hours talking about the<br>
conference <br>
financial woes.  Now I am a member of the Illinois Conference and they<br>
get my tithe of $100 a month and the conference is in worse financial<br>
shape than before.<br>
<p>
The tithe information is not confidential, at least not for church<br>
employees.  Conferences are known to check up on their employees to see<br>
if they are being faithful.<br>
<p>
I would be interested to see a church where there was 100% member<br>
involvement and no money at all.  Somehow I think we would be in better<br>
shape.<br>

        I'm trying to clarify in my mind the SDA definition of the<br>
    "spirit".  I received one response that seemed to indicate that<br>
    when Jesus said "Father, into Thy hands I commit my spirit"<br>
    He was simply quoting Psalm 31:6.  The author of the post "I think"<br>
    was saying that at Jesus' death, nothing really went into the<br>
    Father's hands.  Jesus was simply quoting a Psalm.  When I compare<br>
    that with Steve Timm's reponse, it seems that Steve is stating that<br>
    something did indeed return to the Father at Jesus' death.  What<br>
    Steve Timm refers to as a "backup".<br>
 <br>
    Question:  Are you saying that between Jesus' Crucifixion and His<br>
    Resurrection, the eternal Son of God ceased to exist ? ?<br>
 <br>
    In the SDA formulation of the Trinity, is one of the Son's<br>
    attributes, His eternity?  I.E. No beginning, no end ? ?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
    In Hebrews 12:22,23 it says :<br>
 <br>
        But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the<br>
    living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable<br>
    company of angels,<br>
        To the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are<br>
    written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits<br>
    of just men made perfect......        KJV<br>
 <br>
        Are you then saying that this could be reworded and the<br>
    "backup copies" of men made perfect ?<br>
 <br>
     What about the spirits of wicked men, not made perfect ?<br>
     It would appear that they would not be in the heavenly Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
     Would you eqate Steve Timm's idea of a back-up with the term<br>
     soul in  either Genesis 35:18, or Matthew 10:28 ?  Or is that<br>
     that something else ?<br>
 <br>

[Ruben]<br>
<i>&gt;So in this sense salvation is not received until that day in the New Jerusalem. </i><br>
Perhaps a little sooner than that:<br>
<p>
   " "And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you; for you shall <br>
   be repaid at the resurrection of the just." "  --  Luke 14:14  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   ""And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward  is with Me, to give to <br>
   every one according to his work.  "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the <br>
   Beginning and  the End, the First and the Last."  Blessed are those who <br>
   do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, <br>
   and may enter through the gates into the city."  --  Rev 22:12-14  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
It would seem that our salvation is not given us till the 2nd Coming.<br>

Hi, folks in greater SDA-L land.<br>
 <br>
I have now been added to SDA-L as a listowner, but it will still take<br>
a while for me to learn the ropes of helping to manage the LISTSERV.<br>
Some people have written to me and others to Enoch about subscribing<br>
or desubscribing or setting NOMAIL.  In a couple weeks we will be ready<br>
to handle everyone's requests more expeditiously than we can right now.<br>
 <br>
Thanks for all your patience.<br>
 <br>
Steve Timm<br>

One of the things we often speak of in Adventism is the Reformation and<br>
how forgotten truth was rediscovered.  We trace Huss, Wycliffe, Luther,<br>
Calvin, Zwingli, Farel, then on to Wesley, et al, finally talking about<br>
the contributions to rediscovered truths that we believe we SDA's have made.<br>
<p>
One of the observations we make is that often (re)discoveries were made in<br>
parallel and that reformers often learned from their predecessors,<br>
building upon that foundation.<br>
<p>
Another observation is that the churches started by the reformers almost<br>
invariably did not progress and accept the newly rediscovered truthes<br>
found by subsequent reformers.  Indeed, one could argue that today many<br>
of those churches are in declension from the teachings they were originally<br>
established upon.  So, what happened?<br>
<p>
My wife has been reading a biography of Katherine von Bora, the wife of<br>
Martin Luther.  In some ways, it is also an excellent biography of<br>
Luther himself.  Many passages are direct from his writings, her writings,<br>
and the notes and writings of those who were close.  In one passage that<br>
my wife was reading Martin is grieving over converts to the Reform faith.<br>
Many of them, it seems, were once zealous in saying their Hail Marys,<br>
attending Mass, taking communion, going to the confessional, etc.  But<br>
now, having accepted the Reformed faith, they are becoming slothful and<br>
lukewarm.  They attend church, pay their tithes and offerings, send their<br>
kids to church school .. but they are not growing spiritually!  (The<br>
comfortable pew syndrome?)<br>
<p>
Sutherland, in his book on principles of Christian Education, indicates that<br>
Luther and Melancthon established a school system as diametrically opposite<br>
to the Catholic system as they could.  Within scant years, all of Germany<br>
as well as other areas, had converted to the Reformed faith.  One could<br>
not find a Catholic.  Shortly after the death of these two, however,<br>
school and church leaders started to push for certain "reforms", ostensibly<br>
to achieve academic excellence.  These "reforms" slowly returned the schools<br>
to the methods of the Catholic schools; spiritual excellence declined as<br>
a direct consequence.<br>
<p>
Sutherland observes that folk had failed to establish themselves in<br>
Scripture and its principles (Col 2:7, Acts 17:11) independent of<br>
what they heard by word of mouth from Luther and Melancthon.  Secondly,<br>
Protestantism (SDA's included .. and this was written a long, long time ago)<br>
failed to (re)reform the school system.  {Reading Sutherland absolutely<br>
blows me away!  It is mind boggling what we accept.}<br>
<p>
So, here we sit, at the end of a long line of reformers.  Have "we" not<br>
made strides in spiritual truth beyond those reformers?  Is not God's<br>
blessing upon "our" church in a special and unique way?  Have we not the<br>
world's largest Protestant denominational school system?  And medical system?<br>
It should be a shoe-in! Ah, but are we really in any better shape spiritually<br>
than those other churches?  ... There's no such thing as cultural memory.<br>
You don't inherit salvation because your parents are church members.<br>
No one rides in on anyone else's coattail.  Each must work out his own<br>
salvation (Phi2:12).  Each must grow in grace and in the Scripture (2Pet3:18).<br>
<p>
In our Sabbath school classes do you see folk eagerly pouring over the<br>
Scripture discovering its doctrinal truths *and* principles for daily<br>
life, claiming specific Bible promises for specific answers, encouraging one<br>
another with memorized verses of hope and comfort?  Or are they sitting<br>
silently, with the talkative few saying "I think" this or "it seems to me"<br>
that or occasionally "doesn't Sister White say ..." (they really aren't sure)<br>
or "haven't I read somewhere ..." such-and-such?  Is Rev 3:15,16 not apt?<br>
<p>
OK.  Enough preaching to the choir.  Let's hear what Scripture says<br>
about the spiritual disciplines.  What produces a people redeemed from<br>
all iniquity (doing things my way), purified and peculiar (unique,<br>
outstanding, standing in bold relief), zealous of good works?  (cf Titus 2:14)<br>

<p>
One mundane but it seems to me important aspect of this question has<br>
to do with our old friend "human nature".  The humans I know simply<br>
aren't equipped to continually be challenged on points of "truth".<br>
That does not mean they are not sincere, but it simply means they are<br>
human and fallen.<br>
<p>
You see this in various ways.  For example, the SDA church teaches<br>
that we should go out and "convert the world".  Yet how many of us<br>
would seriously consider allowing some other religion to convert us to<br>
THEIR faith?  If we are not willing to do so, why should we expect<br>
others to convert to OUR faith?<br>
<p>
The point is not that all religions are equally valid, but that most<br>
people including SDAs (and including me) inhabit a comfort zone from<br>
which it is difficult to dislodge them.<br>

Hi Ruben:<br>
<p>
The Bible talks about salvation in three tenses:<br>
<p>
1.  You are saved -- an accomplished fact.<br>
2.  You are being saved -- an on-going work of God in us.<br>
3.  You will be saved -- the final act in our salvation at the 2nd<br>
    Coming.<br>
<p>
My notes on this are at home so I have not noted chapter and verse.<br>
If you would like, I can present the proof texts in another message.<br>
Just let me know so I'll remember to bring my notes in.<br>
<p>
The main point that must be dealt with is that salvation is the work<br>
of God and not man.  And I trust that what God does is perfect,<br>
lacking nothing.  Dave Buxton and I have discussed this before, but my<br>
definition of salvation is not the one you'd expect to hear.  Based on<br>
a study of the words pistis and pisteuo, I find that what Jesus talks<br>
about and what Paul, under inspiration, talks about is not mere mental<br>
movement when they talked of faith and belief.  The Greek words imply<br>
far more than that.  They imply, tacitly, a full, 100 percent, nothing<br>
lacking commitment to Jesus Christ.  So when you read John 3:16, the<br>
word "believe" means precisely this: a full commitment to Jesus<br>
Christ, nothing wavering, nothing withheld, of everything that you<br>
are, or ever will be, and of everything you have, or ever will have.<br>
<p>
This then is the faith of salvation.  And, frankly, I do not find that<br>
to be a natural faith in humans.  This is why Paul writes under<br>
inspiration -- for by grace are you saved through faith, and that [the<br>
faith] not of yourselves, but it is a gift of God ....<br>
<p>
I have heard so many people talk about their faith, and some even have<br>
good works to show, but when faced with a serious event that would<br>
take their life or cause them severe loss (like losing their jobs),<br>
these same people compromise.  What Jesus calls us to is faith that<br>
will not compromise, faith that will stand all the tests that come to<br>
us.  Therein is salvation, and the outworking of our salvation.<br>
<p>
Gotta run for now.<br>
<p>
En Agape tou Iesous,<br>

<i>&gt; In our Sabbath school classes do you see folk eagerly pouring over the</i><br>

<p>
I was pleasantly surprised, upon going home for the day, to find that<br>
the latest Adventist Review (May 21) has an AnchorPoints article by<br>
Alden Thompson encouraging, exhorting us to study the Bible.  On the<br>
second page, middle column, middle of the column are some interesting<br>
EGW quotes on the consequences of not studying Scripture for yourself<br>
but depending upon others.  The article, w/ quotes, also addresses the use<br>
of one's intellect and reasoning (read the article to find out).<br>
<p>
For the life of me, I cannot figure out, tho, why the layout people<br>
accompanied the article with a picture of someone who appears to be<br>
a stereotype of the proverbial hellfire-and-brimstone, Bible-thumping<br>
preacher.  Major cognitive dissonance.<br>

After a visit to my parents over the weekend, I found a tract had been sent <br>
to me called "The unerring eye that reads the Church Manual."  It is<br>
published by an organization which claims to call itself the "Universal<br>
Publishing Association."  The alleged address is Bashan Hill, Exeter,<br>
Missouri, 65647.<br>
<p>
The tract consists of a series of Ellen White quotes plus a set of<br>
quotes from various General Conference bulletins which may or may not be<br>
attributable to her.  These are arranged in the usual arrogant,<br>
point-scoring, repugnant style which characterizes so many of these<br>
compiliations.  Bible verses are nowhere to be seen.  Try as they might,<br>
they<br>
at least don't attempt to reproduce nonexistent Ellen White quotes against a <br>
church manual.  But they do use ample brackets for explanation of quotes<br>
which have little to do with the subject.<br>
<p>
Has anyone else heard of "The Universal Publishing Association"?  If no<br>
one else has, then I apologize for giving them this unwarranted publicity.<br>
I assure you you haven't missed a thing by not reading this tract.<br>

The following two questions have entered my mind recently:<br>
<p>
1)  Are Adventists fundamentalists?<br>
<p>
2)  Should we be?<br>
<p>
Let me begin the discussion by saying that there is a broad definition of the <br>
word, and also a pejorative one.  The broad definition relates to a group <br>
of Protestant theologians in the early 1900's that made a stand against <br>
liberalism and affirmed basic values about the Bible.  They held to <br>
traditionally conservative interpretations in the face of arguments from<br>
communism, evolution, and what have you.  This movement was at its peak<br>
about the time of the death of Ellen G. White in 1915, and it is not<br>
surprising <br>
that the SDA church also followed many of the same theological trends at <br>
that time.<br>
<p>
The pejorative definition is used by the media against those<br>
fundamentalists who have developed a well-formed social agenda. <br>
Fundamentalists are active <br>
in the pro-life movement, the school prayer movement, the anti-pornography <br>
movement and many others.  Some of these social causes I feel are worthwhile,<br>
but I wonder about the methods that are used.  Has God's word in the hand<br>
of fundamentalists changed from the two-edged sword that cuts preacher<br>
as well as listener to a blunt club that is used to beat others into<br>
submission?<br>
I am afraid so.  We see the concept of creeping inspiration where the<br>
manner of presentation implies that not only the Word but also the<br>
interpretation is infallible.<br>
<p>
Now, I realize that in saying this I am questioning belief #1 of the <br>
Statement of Fundamental Beliefs.  (The postulate of the inspiration of<br>
the Bible).  But are we justified to claim for the <br>
Bible (or, for that matter, Ellen G. White) what those writings do not claim <br>
for themselves?  And, even were those writings to claim infallibility, which <br>
they do not, is that excuse to use them as a club against all those who<br>
disagree?<br>
<p>
I hope some careful discussion can be generated about this in the near future.<br>
<p>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Gene writes :<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The Bible talks about salvation in three tenses:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1.  You are saved -- an accomplished fact.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.  You are being saved -- an on-going work of God in us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3.  You will be saved -- the final act in our salvation at the 2nd</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Coming.</i><br>
<p>
I have no problem with this, in fact I agree 100%. The way point 1 is expressed<br>
about however I am a little dubious. I would say our salvation has already been <br>
perfectly worked out for us, I would not say that my salvation in its totality<br>
an accomplised fact.  <br>
<p>
Do you support the opinion that Salvation is like a path that <br>
one travels ? As soon as you step on the path you are saved, and remain<br>
so while you progress along this path ? <br>
<p>
Is it like a race that we enter knowing we will win the prize because <br>
Jesus has promised us the victory, but we only really receive the prize<br>
at the end of the race ?<br>
<p>
We speak about perfection being progressive, ie non-static. It is not<br>
a stage one reaches but a phase one enters of perpetual advancement.<br>
<p>
Can the same be said of salvation ? Is it not a stage one attains but<br>
a process of continual and more complete salvation. Let me see, how could I <br>
exemplify this statement :<br>
<p>
When one is converted he is perfectly saved from his/her past, and ample<br>
salvation for the present is supplied. As one cherishes this present salvation,<br>
power is given us to save us from present/future evil/sin. Finally we shall <br>
be saved from the very presense of sin. The past salvation is from our guilt,<br>
the present salvation is from sin and the future salvation is from morality.<br>
<p>
I suppose one could say this sounds like a bit of a discussion of whether<br>
sanctification and (glorification )is part of salvation, but I don't think <br>
that is really what I am getting at. I accept 100% that without santification <br>
there is no justification, and vice versa (ie you need both for salvation to be <br>
effective) I really wish to understand the correct usage of the term salvation.<br>
<p>
Do we conclude that the term Salvation has multiple meanings each distinct<br>
and separate ? If so then every time we speak of salvation we must quantify<br>
exactly to which salvation it is that we mean.<br>
<p>
Or do we conclude that salvation is a process and that while one is on the <br>
path his salvation is progressively more perfect?<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Ruben.<br>

Yes, they are one of the "Shepherd's Rod" group, the biggest one, and they<br>
are DANGEROUS!  Beware!  Many of them believe that THEY are to be the<br>
destroying angel of Ezekiel 8-9... and will have to kill (murder) all those<br>
who don't accept the "Shepherd's Rod" beliefs...<br>
<p>
They also have a SECOND prophet!  His name was Hotef (sp), and he said that<br>
if everyone would move down to where he lived, in the south, that they all<br>
would eventually move to Israel, to be the 144,000 and never die.  Hotef<br>
died in the 1930's.  (His wife carried the "torch" for awhile, but then<br>
recanted the whole thing...)<br>
<p>
The followers seem to be alive and well, and printing ALL the old tracts.<br>

Eric Snyder raises several questions about the spirit and by extension <br>
the soul.  In particular, is the spirit the same as the soul.  As defined <br>
in Genesis 35:18, the answer is no.  As to Matthew 10:28, it's more <br>
difficult to say.  Perhaps someone with a Strong's can tell us what <br>
Greek word is translated "soul" in that verse:  "Fear not them which kill<br>
the body, but are not able to kill the soul, but rather fear him which is <br>
able to destroy both soul and body in hell."<br>
<p>
Eric is referring to two verses here which suggest that in addition to <br>
being a soul, we also have a soul.  There are several others.  I have an <br>
explanation for this but would like to hear what other netters have to say<br>
about these and other verses.<br>
<p>
As to the question Eric puts forth "Did the Son of God cease to exist <br>
over the Passion Weekend?"  I will not claim to know what happened to <br>
the divine nature of Christ over this time (maybe others can shed light<br>
on this) but as far as is observable to human eyes his death was not <br>
physically different than any of ours.  <br>
<p>
Perhaps the best way to describe the spirit is the character of a person.<br>
We need to discuss this more and really look at answering the questions about <br>
this doctrine that people are asking now. <br>

Over the weekend of May 16, most of the Adventist Review staff visited<br>
the Hinsdale, IL area.  I attended the forum that they held in the afternoon.<br>
As might be expected, Associate Editor Roy Adams proved to be the<br>
lightning rod for the afternoon, with a large part of the discussion<br>
centered on his<br>
editorials espousing unconventional views on church-state relations.<br>
<p>
(For background--Roy Adams has suggested in his editorials that it <br>
might be appropriate for those SDA parents who send their children to <br>
parochial schools to receive some refund of the property tax they pay to <br>
support the public schools.)<br>
<p>
He made the following point in response to questions:  Sometimes when <br>
the SDA church stands against organized prayer in public schools, and <br>
other similar issues, we appear to be anti-religion.<br>
<p>
(He made his point much better than I just did.  My apologies.)<br>
<p>
Other side issues:  William Johnsson responded to the issue of the change<br>
of three angels to three wavy lines:  "The three wavy lines in the "A"<br>
of Adventist Review are three stylized angels."  No lie.<br>

All the references in the NT translated as "soul" by the KJV trace back to <br>
the same Greek word "psuche".  Strong's Concordance gives the primary meaning<br>
of this word as "spirit".  In the NT it is almost always referred to in the <br>
possessive, in other words as something one has rather than something one is.<br>
This is what would be expected when you view the whole person as a <br>
composite of body and spirit, frequently referred to , as in Matt 10:28,<br>
as "body and soul."<br>
<p>
This is distinct from the Greek word "pneuma", usually translated "spirit"<br>
which is used interchangeably to refer to the Holy Spirit, evil spirits,<br>
or the human spirit.<br>
<p>
More later.  I've got to get to work.<br>

Perhaps a good way to respond to Steve's &amp; Eric's posts is to point<br>
out that:<br>
<p>
 * The OT is especially clear that body, soul, spirit were all seen<br>
   to be parts of man's inseparable WHOLENESS.<br>
<p>
 * The Greeks taught that these were parts of man's SEPARATENESS that<br>
   came together temporarily during a man's lifetime.<br>
<p>
Greek is the language of the NT.  It can be clearly established which<br>
words from the Hebrew were used in the Greek to mean soul and spirit.<br>
Do we use the Hebrew meanings that can be clearly established with<br>
a careful Hebrew and/or Concordance study?  From such a study it<br>
becomes clear that these are parts of man's wholeness.  Or do we use<br>
the Greek meanings?  Augustine is an example of an early church "father"<br>
who did much to popularize the views of Plato's Helenism (Greek Culture)<br>
on the separableness of man.  The earliest of the "church father's"<br>
were not yet into this sort of theology.  But over the years the<br>
philosophy of the Greeks became more and more accepted church theology.<br>
<p>
We know that the Pharisees absorbed a lot of Greek culture, even<br>
believing in the separableness of man.  I sometimes ponder to what<br>
extent Paul was influenced by his Pharisaical up bringing.  There are<br>
times when Paul speaks very clearly that, for example, our reward comes<br>
not at death but at the ressurection.  But when Paul seems a bit<br>
ambiguous is it his former training in Greek culture leaking through?<br>
<p>
That raises a question.  Does our model of what makes a prophet and/or<br>
a Bible writer allow that some heresies might glint here and there<br>
because of a Bible writer's former upbringing?  I think that to be<br>
on the safe side we had better define our terms from the Old Testament<br>
as much as possible and avoid tainting our terms from Greek Philosophy.<br>
<p>
Some theologians actually teach that the OT folks were somewhat ignorant<br>
of all the truth on the matter of the after life, that God exposed them<br>
to Helenism to bring them to an understanding of the true nature of<br>
the soul and spirit of man.  That is their objection to the clear<br>
position of the OT on the inseparableness of man.  I cannot buy that.<br>
What comes to mind is the sermons of Paul speaking out against the<br>
philosophy of the Greeks.  They are were not inspired of God as were<br>
the writers of the OT.  And so it is that I define my terms from the OT.<br>
That defines for me the inseprable nature of man.<br>

<p>
Thanks Steve for asking the question I would have asked if I was there.<br>
Perhaps it is best to accept this as their answer, it does seem plausible.<br>
The reasons I wish they would change back is that the three wavy lines<br>
do have other meanings in other contexts:<br>
<p>
 * The three waves of the Pentecostal movement that the Pentecostals<br>
   speak of.<br>
<p>
 * Many New Agers speak of unity in diversity.  Their three wavy lines<br>
   merge together, at one end.  They merge together at one end because<br>
   the wavy lines are not parallel but draw together at one end.  The<br>
   Adbventist Review merges together because they thicken at one end.<br>
   I doubt they intended a coincidence with the New Age theme.<br>
<p>
 * Publications of the World Council of Churches that use a bold across<br>
   the page three wavy lines that mean  ____(?), Eucarist and _____.  I<br>
   wish I could remember the three.  Sounds like some of the language of<br>
   Vatican II.  A friend of mine has the actually glossy publications<br>
   from the WCC, with the comments of endorsement from the SDA delegate.<br>
   This delegate is reportedly there on his own recognisance and not<br>
   a delegate of the GC.  But his attendance and endorsement does seem<br>
   awfully inappropriate to me.<br>
<p>
OK, so the the new Adventist Review logo is coincidental graphics art.<br>
But I do wish they would get back to something that looks more obviously<br>
like three angels.<br>

The document from the World Council of Churches is "Baptism, Eucharist, and<br>
Ministry."  If you would look at the responses from the churches, published<br>
in four separate volumes, you could read what the SDA Church replied to that<br>
document.  We did not accept the document.  Neither did many other churches,<br>
even ones that ago with the WCC.<br>

Signs of the Times, January 17, 1884:  Ellen White writes  about  a  tithing<br>
problem  (Nehemiah  13)  that  developed  while  Nehemiah  was  absent  from<br>
Jerusalem.  Rather than scolding the people, Nehemiah corrected the problem.<br>
The  following  is  the  4th  paragraph  of  Ellen White's Review and Herald<br>
article on how Nehemiah restored tithing and the Sabbath to Jerusalem:<br>
<p>
     Not only had the temple been  profaned,  but  the  offerings  had  been<br>
     misapplied.   This  tended  to discourage the liberality of the people.<br>
     They lost their zeal and fervor in the cause of God, and were reluctant<br>
     to  pay  their  tithes.   The  treasuries  of the Lord's house were but<br>
     poorly supplied; and the singers and others employed in the temple ser-<br>
     vice  not  receiving a sufficient support, many left the work of God to<br>
     labor elsewhere  for  the  maintenance  of  their  families.   Nehemiah<br>
     promptly  corrected  these  abuses.  He gathered together those who had<br>
     forsaken the service of the house of God, and  caused  the  tithes  and<br>
     offerings  to  be restored.  Faithful men were appointed to take charge<br>
     of the means raised, confidence was restored,  and  all  judah  brought<br>
     their tithes to the treasuries of the Lord. -- 1 ST 405, 406.  (1884)<br>
<p>
Quotes about the use of the Tithe:<br>
<p>
     God has not changed; the tithe is still to be used for the  support  of<br>
     the ministry.  9T 250<br>

     A great mistake is made when the tithe is drawn  from  the  object  for<br>
     which  it  is to be used -- the support of the ministers.  There should<br>
     be today in the field one hundred  well-qualified  laborers  where  now<br>
     there is but one.  --  Gospel Workers, p. 226<br>
<p>
     Some have been dissatisfied, and have said, "I will no  longer  pay  my<br>
     tithe;  for  I  have no confidence in the way things are managed at the<br>
     heart of the work."  But will you rob God because you think the manage-<br>
     ment  of  the  work  is  not  right?   Make your complaint, plainly and<br>
     openly, in the right spirit, to the proper ones.  Send  in  your  peti-<br>
     tions  for  things to be adjusted and set in order; but do not withdraw<br>
     from the work of God, and prove  unfaithful,  because  others  are  not<br>
     doing right.  -- Gospel Workers, p. 227.<br>
<p>
     It is to be especially devoted to the support of those who are  bearing<br>
     God's  message  to  the  world; and it should not be diverted from this<br>
     purpose.  --  Councils on Stewardship p. 103.<br>
<p>
     He intends that the ministry of the gospel shall  be  fully  sustained.<br>
     He  claims  the  tithe  as His own, and it should ever be regarded as a<br>
     sacred reserve, to be placed in His treasury for  the  benefit  of  His<br>
     cause, for the advancement of His work, for sending His messengers into<br>
     "regions beyond," even to the  uttermost  parts  of  the  earth.     --<br>
     Councils on Stewardship p.  71.<br>
<p>
     The tithe is sacred, reserved by God for Himself.  It is to be  brought<br>
     into  His  treasury  to be used to sustain the gospel laborers in their<br>
     work.    -- Councils on Stewardship p.  93.<br>
<p>
     The tithe should go to those who labor in word and  doctrine,  be  they<br>
     men or women.  --  Evangelism, p. 492.<br>
<p>
     If women do the work that is not the most agreeable to  many  of  those<br>
     who  labor  in  word and doctrine, and if their works testify that they<br>
     are accomplishing a work that has been manifestly neglected, should not<br>
     such  labor  be  looked upon as being as rich in results as the work of<br>
     the ordained ministers?  Should it not command the hire of the laborer?<br>
     . . . . - Evangelism 493.<br>
<p>
     When it is possible, let the minister and his wife go  forth  together.<br>
     The  wife  can  often labor by the side of her husband, accomplishing a<br>
     noble work.  She can visit the homes of the people and help  the  women<br>
     in these families in a way that her husband cannot . . .   --Evangelism<br>
     491.<br>
<p>
     Select women who will act an earnest part.  The Lord will use  intelli-<br>
     gent  women  in  the  work  of  teaching.  And let none feel that these<br>
     women, who understand the Word, and who have ability to  teach,  should<br>
     not  receive  remuneration  for  their  labors.  They should be paid as<br>
     verily as are their husbands.  --Evangelism 491.<br>
<p>
     Our conferences look to  the  schools  for  educated  and  well-trained<br>
     laborers,  and  they should give the schools a most hearty and intelli-<br>
     gent support.  Light has been plainly given that those who minister  in<br>
     our  schools, teaching the word of God, explaining the Scriptures, edu-<br>
     cating the students in the things of God, should be  supported  by  the<br>
     tithe money.  This instruction was given long ago, and more recently it<br>
     has been repeated again and again.  -- 6T 215.<br>
<p>
     Some, who do not see the advantage of educating the youth to be  physi-<br>
     cians  both  of the mind and of the body, say that the tithe should not<br>
     be used to support medical missionaries who devote their time to treat-<br>
     ing the sick.  In response to such statements as these, I am instructed<br>
     to say that the mind must not become so narrowed down  that  it  cannot<br>
     take in the truth of the situation.  -- Medical Ministry 245.<br>
<p>
     No line is to be drawn between the genuine medical missionary  and  the<br>
     gospel ministry.  These two must blend.  They are not to stand apart as<br>
     separate lines of work.  These are  to  be  joined  in  an  inseparable<br>
     union.  - - Medical Ministry 250.<br>
<p>
     [The tithe should not be diverted] to  various  objects  which,  though<br>
     good  in  themselves  are not the object to which the Lord has said the<br>
     tithe should be applied.    --  Councils on Stewardship p. 102.<br>
<p>
     It [the tithe] is not to be regarded as a poor fund . . . . for defray-<br>
     ing  the  incidental [operational] expenses of the church.    --  Coun-<br>
     cils on Stewardship p. 103.<br>
<p>
     The portion that God has reserved for Himself is not to be diverted  to<br>
     any  other  purpose than that which He has specified.  Let none feel at<br>
     liberty to retain their tithe, to use according to their own  judgment.<br>
     They  are not to use it for themselves in an emergency, nor to apply it<br>
     as they see fit, even in what they may regard as the Lord's  work.   --<br>
     Gospel Workers p. 225.<br>
<p>
     There are exceptional cases, where poverty is so deep that in order  to<br>
     secure  the humblest place of worship, it may be necessary to appropri-<br>
     ate the tithes.  --  Ellen White Manuscript Releases #48a, 4.<br>
<p>
     In some of the larger conferences the tithe may be more than sufficient<br>
     to  sustain  the laborers now in the field.  But this does not sanction<br>
     its use for any other purpose.  If the conferences were doing the  work<br>
     that  God  desires them to do, there would be many more laborers in the<br>
     field, and the demand  for  funds  would  be  greatly  increased.   The<br>
     conferences should feel a burden for the regions beyond their own bord-<br>
     ers.  There are missions to be sustained in fields where there  are  no<br>
     churches  and  no  tithes, and also where the believers are new and the<br>
     tithe limited.   If you have means that is not  needed  after  settling<br>
     with your ministers in a liberal manner, send the Lord's money to these<br>
     destitute places.  Special light on this point  has  been  given.    --<br>
     Ellen White Manuscript Releases #48, p. 2,3.<br>
<p>
     And if there is a surplus of means in  the  treasury,  there  are  many<br>
     places  where  it may be used strictly in the appointed lines.  In many<br>
     places the dearth of means is so  great  that  the  workers  cannot  be<br>
     employed to do missionary work.  Every dollar of the money put into the<br>
     treasury is not needed in . . . . .  Let the Lord's money be donated to<br>
     support  the  ministers  in foreign countries where they are working to<br>
     lift the standard in new fields.  This is God's money, and  He  designs<br>
     that it shall be used in sustaining the ministry, in educating a people<br>
     to prepare to meet their God . . . . /par/ If you have more means  than<br>
     you need to settle your ministers in a fair, liberal, Christian manner,<br>
     there are other places where you can help, where there are but few peo-<br>
     ple and poor, and the tithe is limited.  Send the Lord's money to them.<br>
     This I have been repeatedly shown is the way to do.   --   Ellen  White<br>
     Manuscript Releases #48a, 2 &amp; 3.<br>
<p>
     The Lord has not given orders to any man to divert money from the chan-<br>
     nel  in  which  it  should  go  .  . . . Who has heard the voice of God<br>
     directing that this means should be diverted into other  channels?   If<br>
     this  is the course our leading brethren are to pursue, what confidence<br>
     can men have to follow out their convictions in making donations to the<br>
     cause  of  God?   Let the money that comes from those whom God has made<br>
     His stewards be received and treated  as  a  sacred  offering,  and  be<br>
     applied  where  it  was designed.  This will tend to inspire confidence<br>
     and encourage liberality in those  whom  God  has  made  His  stewards.<br>
     /par/  But if men, with their finite judgement feel free to appropriate<br>
     these gifts as they see fit, they will confuse that mind  that  in  all<br>
     sincerity  was  moved to bestow his goods on some branch of God's work.<br>
     When our brethren undertake to work according to their own ideas,  they<br>
     will  do  great  harm to souls, they will create doubt and questioning.<br>
     Why should men want to interpose their own ways and ideas to defeat the<br>
     purposes to God?  EGW 1888 Materials, 1236.<br>

     The arrangement that all moneys must go through Battle Creek and  under<br>

     men, and some do not make God their counselor.  --  TM 322.<br>

     You ask if I will accept tithe from you and use it in the cause of  God<br>

Letter to a Conference President -- Mountain View, Calif Jan 22, 1905:<br>
<p>
     Elder Watson:<br>
<p>
     My brother, I wish to say to you, Be careful how you move.  You are not<br>
     moving  wisely.   The  least you have to speak about the tithe that has<br>
     been appropriated to the most needy and the most discouraging field  in<br>
     the world, the more sensible you will be.<br>
<p>
     It has been presented to me for years that my tithe was to be appropri-<br>
     ated  by  myself  to  aid  the  white  and  colored  ministers who were<br>
     neglected and did not receive sufficient property to support their fam-<br>
     ilies.  When my attention was called to aged ministers, white or black,<br>
     it was my special duty to investigate into their necessities and supply<br>
     their needs.  This was to be my special work, and I have done this in a<br>
     number of cases.  No man should give notoriety to the fact that in spe-<br>
     cial cases the tithe is used in that way.<br>
<p>
     In regard to the colored work in the South, that field has been and  is<br>
     still being robbed of the means that should come to the workers of that<br>
     field.  If there has been cases where  our  sisters  have  appropriated<br>
     their  tithe  to  the  support of the ministers working for the colored<br>
     people in the South, let every man, if he is wise, hold his peace.<br>
<p>
     I have myself appropriated my tithe to the most needy cases brought  to<br>
     my  notice.  I have been instructed to do this; and as the money is not<br>
     withheld from the Lord's treasury, it is not a matter  that  should  be<br>
     commented  upon; for it will necessitate my making known these matters,<br>
     which I do not desire to do,  because it is not best.<br>
<p>
     Some cases have been kept before me for  years,  and  I  have  supplied<br>
     their needs from the tithe, as God has instructed me to do,  And if any<br>
     person shall say to me, Sister White, will  you  appropriate  my  tithe<br>
     where  you know it is most needed, I shall say, Yes, I will; and I have<br>
     done so.  I commend those sisters who have placed their tithe where  it<br>
     is  most  needed to help to do a work that is being left undone; and if<br>
     this matter is given publicity, it will create  knowledge  which  would<br>
     better  be left as it is.  I do not care to give publicity to this work<br>
     which the Lord has appointed me to do, and others to do.<br>
<p>
     I send this matter to you so that you shall not make  a  mistake.  Cir-<br>
     cumstances  alter  cases.   I  would  not advise that any should make a<br>
     practice of gathering up tithe money.  But for years there have now and<br>
     then  been persons who have lost confidence in the appropriation of the<br>
     tithe who have placed their tithe in my hands, and said that if  I  did<br>
     not take it they would themselves appropriate it to the families of the<br>
     most needy minister they could find.  I have taken the money,  given  a<br>
     receipt for it, and told them how it was appropriated.<br>
<p>
     I write this to you so that you shall keep cool and not become  stirred<br>
     up and give publicity to this matter, lest many more shall follow their<br>
     example.<br>
<p>

The following was written by the Ellen White Estate, Willie White  Chairman,<br>
1907.<br>
<p>
     As to the proper use of the tithe:  The outline  of  a  statement  upon<br>
     this  subject which was agreed upon was briefly this:  To give extracts<br>
     from Sister White's writings as to the tithe and its use; to show  that<br>
     her  testimony  and  her  own usual practice was in favor of paying the<br>
     tithe into the regularly designated treasury,  to  be  used  under  the<br>
     counsel  of the committees appointed for such purposes; to show further<br>
     from her writings that when those who have charge of the expenditure of<br>
     the tithe so far fail in the discharge of their duty that the regularly<br>
     organized channels for the distribution of the tithe become  hindrances<br>
     to  its proper use, then in order to carry out the divine plan that the<br>
     tithe should be expended in the wisest manner for  the  furtherance  of<br>
     the  work,  individuals  have  the  right to pay their tithes direct to<br>
     needy fields; but that this involves a considerable degree of  personal<br>
     responsibility,  which  must  be  assumed by those who decide to follow<br>
     this plan.  It was thought that this matter could be handled; in a  way<br>
     to  show  that the departure from the regular lines was authorized only<br>
     when the regular plans failed to be carried out by those  in  positions<br>
     of  responsibility.  -- Memorandum of Plans Agreed Upon in Dealing with<br>
     "The Blue Book." From White Estate, File #213.<br>

     The churches must arouse.  The members must  awake  out  of  sleep  and<br>
     begin to inquire, how is the money which we put into the treasury being<br>
     used?  The Lord desires that a close search be made.  Are all satisfied<br>
     with  the history of the work for the past fifteen years?  Where is the<br>
     evidence of the co-working with God?  Where has been  heard  throughout<br>
     the  churches  the prayer for the help of the Holy Spirit? Dissatisfied<br>
     and disheartened, we turn away from the scene.  /par/  Our churches and<br>
     institutions must return to where they were before the backsliding com-<br>
     menced, when they began trusting in man and  making  flesh  their  arm.<br>

     There are fearful woes for those who preach  the  truth,  but  are  not<br>

     There are only two places in the world where we can deposit our  treas-<br>

     I call upon God's people to open their  eyes.   When  you  sanction  or<br>
     carry  out  the  decisions  of men who, as you know, are not in harmony<br>

     The Lord is soon to come,  and  He  calls  upon  all  to  whom  He  has<br>
     entrusted  His  capital of means to invest it in His work as it demands<br>
     help.  His money is not to be shut up in banks and buildings and  lands<br>

     God does not lay upon you the burden of asking the conference,  or  any<br>

     41, 42<br>
<p>
     Some men or councils may say,  That is just what we wish you to do. The<br>
     Conference  Committee  will  take your capital, and will appropriate it<br>
     for this very object.  But the Lord has made us individually  His  ste-<br>
     wards.  We  each  hold  a  solemn  responsibility  to invest this means<br>
     ourselves.  A portion of it is  right  to  place  in  the  treasury  to<br>
     advance  the  general  interests  of the work; but the steward of means<br>
     will not be guiltless before God, unless, so far as he is  able  to  do<br>
     this,  he shall use that means as circumstances shall reveal the neces-<br>
     sity.  We should be ready to help the suffering, and to set  in  opera-<br>
     tion plans to advance the truth in various ways.  It is not in the pro-<br>
     vince of the Conference or any other organization to relieve us of this<br>
     stewardship.   If you lack wisdom, go to God; ask Him for yourself, and<br>
     then work with an eye single to His glory . you  are  made  responsible<br>
     for  its  wise  investment, for its use or abuse. God does not lay upon<br>
     you the burden of asking the Conference or any council of  men  whether<br>
     you  shall  use your means as you see fit to advance the work of God in<br>
     destitute towns and cities, and impoverished localities.   --   Special<br>

     When leaders project a clear vision to the church,  fewer  people  will<br>
     feel  that  they  must go outside of the church to fulfill their dream.<br>
     When leaders build confidence  in  our  church  by  openness,  honesty,<br>
     integrity,  and involvement of all groups, the resources that presently<br>
     flow out of the church will then flow through the church to  accomplish<br>
     our  mission. The members trust in the leadership is indispensable.  --<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; financial commitment, tithes and offerings, is something that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; should not be discussed outside of the boardroom.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This church sounds pretty sick.  Isn't tithe information supposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be secret in the first place?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Even if it's public, judging people on such a basis smacks of</i><br>
<i>&gt;salvation by works.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Even if you consider judging on the basis of tithe to be OK, you would</i><br>
<i>&gt;need information on the person's salary to do it fairly, else a</i><br>
<i>&gt;plastic surgeon making $200K would wipe out a ditch digger making</i><br>
<i>&gt;$20K.  Is the plastic surgeon more valuable to the church (probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;LESS valuable in reality).</i><br>
<p>
  In the LDS church tithing is a prereq for certain things.  You are<br>
interviewed, ususally by the bishop (local congregation minister, but<br>
not really) and asked certain standard questions.  One is 'are you a<br>
faithful full tither'.  You answer yes/no.  But you are really talking<br>
to the Lord and even if you lie to the bishop it will come out in the<br>
wash.  We have even won a court case about using tithing as a prereq for<br>
a church job (some non-religious, but paying job).<br>

I'm interested in this thread on tithing and church office or board<br>
membership.  This issue to me is whether or not a person supports the<br>
church financially -- not what avenue the money goes through.  If a<br>
candidate for church office or board membership does NOT financially<br>
support the church, in any way or through any avenue, then I do not<br>
believe they should hold office or sit on the board.<br>
 <br>
I have sat on nominating committees where this has been an issue and on<br>
others where it was not even brought up.  The one year we had a pastor<br>
who felt that the only proper avenue for tithe was through the conference,<br>
and he wanted that enforced through the nominating committee, I voluntarily<br>
took a sabbatical from any offices.  Notice I said voluntarily.  The<br>
problem was that the criterion was not being equally applied -- one specific<br>
person was kept out of church office and the reason was said to be due<br>
to his lack of paying tithe through the conference.  I told the committee<br>
that I had been known to pay my tithe elsewhere also, and thus should be<br>
rejected by the same criterion.  They were unwilling to do so because I<br>
did sometimes send it through the conference.  This seemed to me to be<br>
a weak defense, so I voluntarily refused office that year.  The next year<br>
all the committee asked was that the treasurer state whether or not a<br>
nominee was supporting the church financially -- no specific percentages<br>
were required, nor certain avenues of support.  That seemed a bit better.<br>
 <br>
By the way, concerning the man who was rejected from office for this reason,<br>
it was handled dismally and he didn't attend church for about 18 months.  I<br>
know, I know, our faith should be such that we continue though the heavens<br>
fall, but I must say I didn't blame him much.  A future pastor did much to<br>
help him heal -- people skills are so useful in the pastorate.<br>
 <br>
Just a war story... to let you know that this happens in other churches.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
The PRIMARY and perhaps ONLY reason we are to pay tithe is because God<br>
requires it of us and those who do not pay a faithful tithe are robbing<br>
God according to Malachi.  Does God recognize our faithful tithe if the<br>
church leaders fail to use the funds as He intended?  Absolutely.  Does<br>
God NOT recognize it if the leaders sqaunder it, manage it poorly, or<br>
even embezzle?  No!  We have followed His command and paid Him what is<br>
due.  So who is responsible for the management of the Lord's money?  The<br>
appointed leaders of the church.  If those leaders seem to be failing in<br>
this assignment, are we justified in ROBBING GOD because of this?  No!<br>
Two wrongs never make a right.  Those who have been appointed to lead<br>
God's church on this earth are responsible for the use of the tithe money<br>
and will face any misuse in the Final Judgement.  Once I have specified<br>
money as tithe and given it back to the Lord, I am neither accountable<br>
or responsible for how that money is used.  Thus, it is probably not my<br>
place to question the use of that money.<br>
<p>
I think the LDS Church position on tithing is solid.  The members are<br>
held accountable for paying their own tithe and certain member functions<br>
and responsibilities in the church are partially based on whether he/she<br>
is paying a faithful tithe (i.e., keeping the Lord's commandments and<br>
living the standards of the church).  The leaders of the LDS church are<br>
responsible for managing the use of the tithe money.  It is not our place<br>
as members to question, criticize, or direct the use of the tithe money<br>
when these leaders have that specific duty and resonsibility and are<br>
accountable to God for it.  Men who are filled with the Holy Spirit and<br>
are leading the church according to God's purpose will NOT be misusing<br>
HIS funds.  If they are NOT using them appropriately, the leadership of<br>
the church will take care of the wayward leader.<br>
<p>
The problem with the SDA church organization in this matter is that there<br>
is the attitude among members that they have the right and responsibility<br>
to oversee the use of the Lord's money.  Numerous financial catastrophes<br>
have lead the members to doubt the leaderships ability to manage the Lord's<br>
church.  This is only a symptom of a much deeper problem--the lack of the<br>
Holy Spirit in the church and men putting man's purposes ahead of God.<br>

<i>&gt;. . . . .</i><br>
<p>
What about Nehemiah 13?   Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem to find<br>
the people had largely quit paying their tithes.  He did not beat<br>
up the people for their neglect.  He looked into the matter, found<br>
the problem and cleared it up.  As soon as the people's confidance<br>
was restored they freely gave again.  The leadership do not have<br>
free license to ignore the protests of the membership and proceed<br>
to give those who protest a rough time, by leveraging the tithe issue.<br>
<p>
Some folks send their tithes directly to poor mission conferences.<br>
They do not neglect to pay their tithe.  It goes to God's work.<br>
A lot of my tithe goes to Joe Crews, none to John Osborne.<br>
To send it to the conference means a large percentage of it gets<br>
spent on the Youth Departments lavish rock music festivals.  That<br>
I cannot conscience.  I have written to the conference about this.<br>
<p>
I suspect you did not read the long list of quotes I sent you.<br>
I would not expect you to as you do not subscribe to Ellen White.<br>
But I find her statements consistent with the Bible in that we<br>
are indeed accountable to God and not to blind faith in man.  If it<br>
goes to God's work in a poor mission field then Amen!  If it goes to<br>
the conference Rock Music festivals, then that is not something for<br>
me to be held accountable for.  So I send it to the Lord's work and<br>
not that of the other camp.  As Ellen White said -- there are two<br>
store houses, God's and Satan's.  My personal conviction is that<br>
rock music festivals are connected to Satan's store house.<br>
<p>
I do very much agree that we should not refrain from tithing.<br>
I do believe we should proceed very caustiously, with much study<br>
and prayer, before we deviate from the standard plan.<br>

I see that my post has created quite a stir in this group. <br>
<p>
The general consensus is that, despite the possibility of church<br>
leaders meddling with the tithe, its symbol as a commitment to<br>
God is much stronger. This also means that the church CAN use<br>
lack of financial support to the church as a reason for denial of<br>
church office. For how can you demonstrate commitment to others<br>
if you can't exhibit a basic commitment to God through your 10%?<br>
<p>
What I wonder now is if a church can enforce a level of tithing.<br>
That is, does the church have the right to know how much you<br>
earn in a year and, armed with that knowledge, use that information<br>
to make sure that you return that much tithe on a consistent basis?<br>
<p>
I understand the major spiritual ramnifications of this discussion.<br>
And I don't want to feel that I'm shortchanging God in any way,<br>
especially on such an important topic.<br>
<p>
But I also feel a sense of legalism in such a question. Are we <br>
starting to debate nits like how much tithe we give, instead of <br>
concentrating on whether we give at all? Whether we are returning<br>
because we have to, or because we want to? Thank God we are able<br>
to give at all!<br>
<p>
Thanks again.<br>

[The words of Rhonda Gaines]<br>
After replying by private mail to Lola, she suggested that I post<br>
this reply to the group.  Here goes... Hope it doesn't start a war<br>
:-)).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In reading the discussion over Hosea's warning about the end of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;new moons celebrations, feast days, and sabbaths, I haven't seen it</i><br>
<i>&gt;brought up as to the possibility that this is not talking about THE</i><br>
<i>&gt;WEEKLY Sabbath...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Weren't some of those feast days, etc. also called sabbaths, even though</i><br>
<i>&gt;they were not WEEKLY Sabbaths?  I've always assumed that this text</i><br>
<i>&gt;talked about the end of the celebration of the feasts, but not the Sabbath</i><br>
<i>&gt;that came every week.  Although, as has been pointed out, those who went</i><br>
<i>&gt;into captivity couldn't celebrate either kind.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Lola Aagaard</i><br>
<i>&gt;Aagaard@Morekypr</i><br>
<p>
Having not read the particular passage of scripture you're referring<br>
to, I can definitely tell you that when the scripture refers to a<br>
sabbath, it isn't always referring to the seventh day sabbath.<br>
That's how many errors in the dating of the feasts have come about,<br>
from the incorrect assumption that sabbath always equals 7th day<br>
sabbath especially when taken out of context.  For example, the<br>
crucifixion has established "Good Friday" because the jews removed<br>
Christ's body from the cross before the beginning of the high<br>
sabbath.  Many, catholics, baptist, etc., assume that this means the<br>
7th day sabbath, when actually it means the feast of unleaven bread<br>
sabbath which is a high sabbath.  They don't take the time to<br>
reference it back to the corroborating (sp?) scriptures in the old<br>
testament or even the new testament for that matter.  In the example<br>
above, the old testament scripture clearly states that the messiah<br>
shall be cut off in the midst of the week.  How the midst (middle)<br>
of the week ever got to be friday, I'll never know :-).  Hope this<br>
provides some favorable enlightenment and that it doesn't<br>
sound...mean.  That's not the word I'm looking for but it's the best<br>
I can do right now :-).<br>

[Note that Rhonda is not presenting an SDA viewpoint here.  Rhonda refers 
to "the midst of the week" from Daniel 9:26, I presume.  When viewed
in the context of the seventy weeks prophecy interpreted according to the 
year-day principle, the week refers to the last 7 years of time alloted 
the Jews, beginning in 27 AD with the baptism of Christ.  Christ was cut 
off in the midst of the week, 31 AD.  Other more persuasive arguments
can be made both for and against a Wednesday crucifixion, we will deal 
with those if we need to.  All that being said, Rhonda's point of 
not all sabbaths being the 7th day Sabbath is, I believe, a valid one.  SCT]

Recent posts have raised questions about confidentiality of members'<br>
giving records, culminating in our moderator's comment:<br>
<i>&gt;  The tithe information is not confidential, at least not for church</i><br>
<i>&gt;  employees.  Conferences are known to check up on their employees to see</i><br>
<i>&gt;  if they are being faithful.</i><br>
<p>
This is true up to a point, but I think perhaps a little clarification<br>
is needed so our non-SDA friends don't get the wrong impression.  I am<br>
an assistant treasurer in Silver Spring, and I asked our treasurer (who<br>
also works part-time at the General Conference) about this.<br>
<p>
Within the local congregation, only the treasurer (plus any assistants)<br>
has regular access to the records of individual members' giving, tithe<br>
or otherwise. (Yes, I know that tithe is "returned," not "given"--I'm<br>
just using a single, generic term to cover tithes and offerings.)<br>
<p>
The pastor has access upon request.  Some pastors never ask; some do.<br>
<p>
As far as the local congregation is concerned, this information is not<br>
supposed to be released to anybody else for any reason.  The finance<br>
committee chairman does not see it; the stewardship director does not<br>
see it; the nominating committee does not see it.  (In that last case,<br>
the pastor is supposed to see to it that nominated officers are regular<br>
tithepayers, but nobody brings out a list of who-gives-what for<br>
inspection by the committee.)<br>
<p>
What about the conference (the next level up from the local church)?<br>
The conference treasurer's office gets the information with the local<br>
church's financial reports.  Again, there are supposed to be clearly<br>
drawn channels about who has access to this information (I specifically<br>
asked about whether anyone there would be trolling for big donors or for<br>
names for mailing lists and was told that would be considered very<br>
inappropriate).<br>
<p>
Church employment is conditioned on tithe payment (as someone quoted<br>
from the _Church_Manual_ recently), but interpretation and enforcement<br>
of this rule apparently varies from place to place.<br>
<p>
No donation information with names attached is supposed to rise above<br>
the conference level.  That is, the unions and the General Conference<br>
get financial reports from below, but nothing with donors' names<br>
listed.<br>
<p>
The basic principle is that tithe and offering information is supposed<br>
to be tightly controlled up through the conference level and is not<br>
propagated beyond.<br>
<p>
About enforcement on non-church-employees and non-church-officers,<br>
the _Church_Manual_ states:<br>
<i>|     Although the returning of the tithe is not held as a test of</i><br>
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <br>
<i>|     fellowship, it is recognized as a scriptural obligation that every</i><br>
      ^^^^^^^^^^<br>
<i>|     believer owes to God and as one of the spiritual exercises in</i><br>
<i>|     which he should have part in claiming by faith the fulness of </i><br>
<i>|     blessing in Christian life and experience</i><br>
<p>
No one is going to force a member to disclose his or her income (note<br>
that the conference already knows how much its employees are making).<br>
Furthermore, there is some question about just what constitutes an<br>
"honest" tithe: do you tithe on your gross income? net? before taxes?<br>
"increase?" Does a retiree who spent his working life tithing his gross<br>
income pay a tithe on his Social Security check, or some part of it?<br>
It's like Sabbathkeeping: some things are clearly in bounds, and some<br>
are clearly out of bounds, but the church has not drawn up a long set<br>
of official rules detailing exactly what goes and doesn't go.<br>

<i>&gt; ... This also means that the church CAN use lack of financial support</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the church as a reason for denial of church office. For how can you</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrate commitment to others if you can't exhibit a basic</i><br>
<i>&gt; commitment to God through your 10%?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What I wonder now is if a church can enforce a level of tithing.  That</i><br>
<i>&gt; is, does the church have the right to know how much you earn in a year</i><br>
<i>&gt; and, armed with that knowledge, use that information to make sure that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you return that much tithe on a consistent basis?</i><br>
<p>
This is an interesting issue.  Most of us would agree that there has<br>
to be some discrimination for church office, but how do you decide?<br>
For example, I think a person who is grossly overweight (temperance)<br>
but pays tithe is no more qualified for church office than someone of<br>
normal weight who doesn't pay tithe.  However, if the church started<br>
REALLY enforcing this kind of rule, there would be an uproar.<br>
<p>
Perhaps one key to this is to note that the judgement of the church is<br>
not the judgement of God.  Billy Graham would be deemed unsuitable for<br>
SDA church office (he worships on the wrong day of the week), but who<br>
can deny he is a man of God?<br>

[The words of Rhonda Gaines]<br>
"For example, the crucifixion has established "Good Friday" because the jews <br>
removed Christ's body from the cross before the beginning of the high sabbath.<br>
Many, catholics, baptist, etc., assume that this means the 7th day sabbath, <br>
when actually it means the feast of unleaven bread sabbath which is a high <br>
sabbath."<br>
<p>
I believe the use of "High Sabbath" refers to when a ceremonial sabbath falls <br>
on the seventh-day sabbath. Whenever two sabbaths fell on the same day it was <br>
referred to as a "High Sabbath." This might refer to the beginning of the <br>
feast of unleavened bread falling on the seventh-day sabbath.<br>

I wrote:<br>
# <br>
# &gt;The Bible talks about salvation in three tenses:<br>
# &gt;<br>
# &gt;1.  You are saved -- an accomplished fact.<br>
# &gt;2.  You are being saved -- an on-going work of God in us.<br>
# &gt;3.  You will be saved -- the final act in our salvation at the 2nd<br>
# &gt;   Coming.<br>
<p>
Ruben responds: <br>
# I have no problem with this, in fact I agree 100%. The way point 1 is <br>
# expressed about however I am a little dubious. I would say our salvation <br>
# has already been perfectly worked out for us, I would not say that <br>
# my salvation in its totality an accomplised fact.  <br>
<p>
First, does God ever give us an imperfect gift!?  And if we agree that<br>
salvation is a gift (Eph. 2:8, 9), then what would be lacking or<br>
incomplete about it?  Would it not be salvation to the uttermost, for<br>
all eternity?<br>
<p>
Second, the oft quoted verse of John 3:16 states that if we believe<br>
(pistis) we have (present tense, an accomplished fact) eternal life<br>
(or salvation).<br>
<p>
The problem is that while we come alive spiritually we still have a<br>
physical body that is unregenerated.  Our flesh is still subject to<br>
the lusts thereof.  So, the path you talk about, Brother Ruben, is<br>
indeed a path -- we are working out our salvation in fear and<br>
trembling.  Each day we must appropriate anew the power of our<br>
glorious Savior to defeat our own flesh and sinful tendencies, and to<br>
come against an implaccable, though defeated, foe.  Were it not for<br>
the fact of our salvation, which we took possession of at the moment<br>
we believed (pistis, again), we would be powerless to make this<br>
journey on the path of God's salvation.<br>
<p>
But we must never think that it is our works that earn us the<br>
salvation.  The salvation is a gift, given freely by God because of<br>
His grace and not our own merit.  Our works are part of the discipline<br>
(in the instructional sense of that word) that we take on as God works<br>
in our lives to conform us to the image of His Son (Rom. 8:29).<br>
<p>
Too often, some render works to the background of Christian living.<br>
Others seem to place all the stress on works and little on the grace<br>
of God that brought us the gift of salvation.  The balance and the<br>
truth of this matter is not in the extremes.  It is in realising what<br>
the works are for and that they come after the person's salvation.<br>
The works will not come without first being born-again.  This is not<br>
to say that some don't have works without salvation, but they do not<br>
stand for long in the presence of the Eternal Creator God who will<br>
judge all things.  And in fact, I think we are beginning to see some<br>
of those works being judged now -- for God always starts houseclening<br>
in His own house first.<br>
<p>
Hope this helps to better explain my own understanding of salvation<br>
and works.  And before someone asks, yes, I do believe that a person<br>
who is saved is saved for eternity.  However, I would point you back<br>
to my previous article on what I believe is meant by the Greek words<br>
pistis and pisteuo, which we translate believe and faith.  I don't<br>
accpet the notion that what is being talked about is some mere mental<br>
exercise.  Something more profound is going on, something that takes<br>
the person from here to eternity spiritually, which results in such in<br>
all-consuming change of that person's life and thoughts that they<br>
really have become a "new creature" in Christ.  I recall knowing that<br>
I could do nothing without Christ and because of Him I would do<br>
anything and everything that He asked.  There was never a doubt, and<br>
there still isn't.  Am I perfect -- NOPE!  I still stumble around and<br>
fail -- my knees are getting very sore as I get older. ;-)  But I know<br>
that my salvation is sure and assured because of the surety of God --<br>
the Holy Spirit -- and because God has never given an gift that was<br>
lacking in anything, nor one that was dependent upon me.<br>
<p>
Gotta run.  Later, friends.<br>

  If the position that death = an unconscious state were we don't know<br>

exercise that power if in an unthinking state?<br>

To SDAnet,<br>
<p>
In our church there are those who protest that this person or that<br>
person is not a loving person because they protest certain things,<br>
such as celebration themes.  Or they say the protests have not been<br>
done in a "loving" way.  But there are those who get mighty abrasive<br>
at times in their promotion of (for example again) celebration themes.<br>
And nobody says they are unloving.  It would seem that any protest is<br>
inherantly unloving.  And that you are pretty safe of the love scale<br>
if you aggressively promote most anything.<br>
<p>
This leads me to ponder if the "love" litmus is popularity?  If someone<br>
is popular they are more likely to be sited as 'loving' examples.<br>
<p>
Also, for example in Sabbath School class, when ever the discussion<br>
gets into some of the weightier matters of the Torah there are those<br>
who pipe up with -- but love is the only thing that matters.  They<br>
would just as soon not participate in . . . . . . because its not<br>
on their list of subtitles under the topic of 'love'.  I might think<br>
it is, but according to their criteria its not a relevant discussion<br>
considering that "love is the only thing that matters".<br>
<p>
Please, I don't want to be starting a 'celebration' thread here.  I<br>
don't want to be starting a liberals vs conservatives pitched battle.<br>
I do want some serious comments about what really is the 'love' that<br>
the Bible calls for.<br>
<p>
Ellen White talks a lot about "lovesick sentimentalism" being mistaken<br>
for love, being mistake for the gospel.  Is it is the dangerous<br>
theology she makes it out to be?<br>
<p>
One discussion I was reading a few days ago mentioned that the Greeks<br>
objected to the Bible writers using the word Agape.  To the Greeks<br>
agape was an obscure, unatainable theoretical sort of love.  Heavenly<br>
eros was to the Greeks the ultimate in love.  So, some of the early<br>
'fathers' started using eros in place of agape.  This created quite<br>
an uproar from some quarters.  So, Augustine solved the problem by<br>
synthesizing the word critos (I'm sure I have it spelled wrong).  This<br>
is a latin word and was meant to be the synthesis of eros and agape.<br>
This was seen to be both the form of love that God exhibits and the<br>
form of love that man is capable of.  It meant that God had to be<br>
met half way in order to be saved.  The King James, for example,<br>
translates it "cherity".  I looked up cherity in my Youngs Concordance<br>
and sure enough, every single instance of cherity comes from agape.<br>
The greatest of these is "AGAPE", not eros/agape.   But is man capable<br>
of agape?  No!  Is God capable of implanting agape into a human? Yes!<br>
Does God meet us when we are at -100% ?  YES!  Even in the depths of<br>
hell on earth.<br>
<p>
We know that God alone is the judge of what is agape love.  We cannot<br>
fathom its depths and bredth.   But can we establish some criteria<br>
of what it is?  When God sent Jonah to Ninevah was God calling Jonah<br>
to demonstrate agape love while Jonah prefered eros -- hey these<br>
folks are going to . . . . . if I preach that kind of a sermon.<br>
Is Agape vs Eros even relevent when we talk about Jonah?<br>
When we read about the prophets of the OT who made some rather bold<br>
statements in the face of kings and priests, were they demonstrating<br>
agape, or did agape only show up after the cross?   Is it possible that<br>
our various litmus of Christian love is more tainted by Hollywood than<br>
by the Bible?<br>
<p>
And so I ask, what really is love [agape].  What texts can you offer<br>
to illuminate this question?   Or must we consult the overall fabric<br>
of the Bible record from cover to cover?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;   If the position that death = an unconscious state were we don't know</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything, how could Jesus raise himself?  The NT clear says in a couple</i><br>
<i>&gt; of places that Jesus had power given him to raise himself.  How could he</i><br>
<i>&gt; exercise that power if in an unthinking state?</i><br>
<p>
   " "whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was <br>
   not possible that He should be held by it. "  --  Acts 2:24  (NKJ)<br>

   Death no longer has dominion over Him."  --  Rom 6:9  (NKJ)<br>

   "But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, <br>
   He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal <br>
   bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you."  --  Rom 8:11  (NKJ)<br>

Glen posted:<br>
<p>
"This is an interesting issue.  Most of us would agree that there has<br>
to be some discrimination for church office, but how do you decide?<br>
For example, I think a person who is grossly overweight (temperance)<br>
but pays tithe is no more qualified for church office than someone of<br>
normal weight who doesn't pay tithe.  However, if the church started<br>
REALLY enforcing this kind of rule, there would be an uproar.<br>
"<br>
<p>
Glen is assuming that obesity is caused by intemperance.  This is not<br>
necessarily the case.  In fact, science is discovering that the genetic<br>
predisposition to obesity is very real and that many people struggle all<br>
their life with an image that they grossly indulge when this is not the<br>
case.  For many, obesity is something they struggle with all their life<br>
and there seems to be very little they can do about it.  Tithing on the<br>
other hand is just a choice and commitment.  There is not predisposition<br>
genetically to be a nontither.  I have been a member of the an SDA church<br>
in the past where the head elder regularly took his family skiing on<br>
Sabbath, other elders drank alcohol socially, and the wives wore furs and<br>
gaudy jewelry to church.  These items are more appropriate measures of<br>
"conformity to church standards" than obestiy.  However, whenever we start<br>
judging others based on outward appearances, we are not following God's<br>
way.  I think the SDA church organization which has members of the local<br>
church selecting individuals for church office will encourage the use of<br>
outward appearance and behavior patterns in the selection process.  The<br>
LDS church, on the other hand, offers "calls" for all church positions<br>
based on the decision of the bishopric (lay leaders) of the ward.  Sometimes<br>
individuals are given an assignment, not because they are "worthy" but<br>
rather to give them an opportunity for spiritual and personal growth.<br>
<p>
For example, I doubt the disciple known as Simon, later called Peter, would<br>
have been given an SDA church office.  Yet Jesus called him personally and<br>
through his association with Christ became a powerful church leader.<br>
<p>
Another issue in the nomination of church officers in the SDA church is<br>
that many times the nominating committee cannot find anyone "willing" to<br>
accept an appointment.  For example, the SDA church in Salt Lake City has<br>
always had trouble finding anyone willing to lead the Earliteen &amp; Junior<br>
divisions.  We also had several Sabbaths that the cradle roll and kindergarten<br>
teachers just didn't show.  I don't know how prevalent these kinds of<br>
problems are across the US, but how does the local church deal with these?<br>

<i> &gt;From the keyboard of Steven Timm &lt;uunet!andrew.cmu.edu!st0o+&gt;:</i><br>
<i>&gt;[Note that Rhonda is not presenting an SDA viewpoint here.  Rhonda refers </i><br>
<i>&gt;to "the midst of the week" from Daniel 9:26, I presume.  When viewed</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the context of the seventy weeks prophecy interpreted according to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;year-day principle, the week refers to the last 7 years of time alloted </i><br>
<i>&gt;the Jews, beginning in 27 AD with the baptism of Christ.  Christ was cut </i><br>
<i>&gt;off in the midst of the week, 31 AD.  Other more persuasive arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt;can be made both for and against a Wednesday crucifixion, we will deal </i><br>
<i>&gt;with those if we need to.  All that being said, Rhonda's point of </i><br>
<i>&gt;not all sabbaths being the 7th day Sabbath is, I believe, a valid one.  SCT]</i><br>

Steve, I would appreciate hearing the arguments against a Wednesday<br>
crucifixion.  I have none and would like to be enlightened on the<br>

In the question about just when are we saved, I offer the following <br>
parable, adapted from ideas set forth in a book I once tried to write:<br>
<p>
We are born on the beach and live there most of the time.  There's nothing<br>
inherently wrong with being on the beach, but it is dangerous.  Hurricanes,<br>
tidal waves, and sharks come along from time to time.  A cliff rising<br>
directly up from the beach offers safety at its top but is difficult if<br>
not impossible to climb.<br>
<p>
Most people believe in the Great Lifeguard, even though they've never<br>
seen him.  But the theories are widely different.  Some say "The Great<br>
Lifeguard has done it all for you already.  You can just stay here on<br>
the beach and you'll be fine."  Others are taught at "cliff school" that<br>
it is their duty to try to climb the cliff.  "If you haven't made it to<br>
the top yet when the tidal wave comes, then the Great Lifeguard will<br>
pull you the rest of the way."<br>
<p>
I tried to climb the cliff, but found that I quickly slid back down to the<br>
base.  I saw the cliff-divers jump off the cliff and fall to the water below.<br>
I tried jumping up, but still fell back to the bottom.  I concluded that<br>
the law of gravity doomed me to existence at the bottom.  "As long as I<br>
stay pretty close to shore, I'll be all right."<br>
<p>
I didn't even see the tidal wave coming.  I turned around and only had time <br>
to call HELP!  Just as it seemed I would be smashed up against the rocks <br>
of the cliff, I felt the strong arms of the Great Lifeguard grab me,<br>
and a lifeline quickly pulled me up the cliff to safety. <br>
<p>
"I'm saved!"  I shouted, and rushed to join the line of cliff divers<br>
ready to jump off the cliff.<br>
<p>
---------<br>
<p>
Here ends the parable.  There are several things that can be said about<br>
salvation, the nature of Christ, and the nature of the law using this<br>
parable.   Please comment on what you think the parable is saying, as <br>
well as my comments below. <br>
<p>
The important things I draw from it are<br>
<p>
1)  The Great Lifeguard doesn't break the law of gravity when he takes<br>
someone to the top of the cliff.  Instead, at the top of the cliff the<br>
law of gravity works to your advantage.<br>
<p>
2)  The Great Lifeguard has something we don't, a direct lifeline to the <br>
top, yet he seeks to give the use of this lifeline to anyone who wants it.<br>
<p>
3)  When talking of being saved, it's important to remember what we are<br>
being saved from and why we need to be saved from it.<br>

<i> &gt;From the keyboard of "Edward W. Fargusson" &lt;uunet!compuserve.com!72450.2430&gt;:</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe the use of "High Sabbath" refers to when a ceremonial sabbath falls </i><br>
<i>&gt;on the seventh-day sabbath. Whenever two sabbaths fell on the same day it was </i><br>
<i>&gt;referred to as a "High Sabbath." This might refer to the beginning of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;feast of unleavened bread falling on the seventh-day sabbath.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ed Fargusson @ Compuserve: 72450,2430</i><br>
<p>
But then you negate the OT prophecy that the messiah would be cut<br>
off in the the midst of the week and the NT prophecy that the<br>
messiah would be in the heart of the earth 3 days and 3 nights.  <br>
In our denomination (gee I hate to use that<br>
word...it's not about denomination, but salvation) we refer to what<br>
you're calling a "High Sabbath" as a "Double Sabbath".  I'll post what I<br>
consider a high sabbath after I've had a chance to get some<br>
scriptures together.  For now, here's how I *firmly* believe the<br>
crucifixion is timed.  <br>
<p>
1.  Wednesday - Jesus crucified on passover (Body removed from<br>
    the cross and buried before sundown so it would not be hanging<br>
    on the cross on the high sabbath (beginning of the feast of unleaven <br>
    bread)<br>
2.  Thursday - High sabbath (feast of unleaven bread)<br>
3.  Friday - preparation day for the 7th day sabbath<br>
4.  Saturday - 7th day sabbath<br>
<p>
Therefore Jesus was in the grave 3 days and 3 nights (Wednesday,<br>
Thursday, and Friday nights; Thursday, Friday, and Saturday days)<br>
with him being risen at the end of the 7th day Sabbath.<br>
<p>
My conclusion is that if these prophecies were not fulfilled then<br>
Jesus could not have been the messiah.  But since the prophecies<br>
were fulfilled then he is the messiah, not that there is any<br>
question in this forum over that.<br>
<p>
Please try to disprove this theory with scriptural reference.  I<br>
appreciate the opportunity to be challenged to force me to dig<br>
deeper into the scriptures.  I do not say this in an argumentative<br>
sense nor do I take my beliefs lightly, but from my studies this is <br>
what I have found to be true and if I am in error I want to know the <br>
truth.<br>

Hi All,<br>
<p>
<p>
Gene writes :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;First, does God ever give us an imperfect gift!?  And if we agree that</i><br>
<i>&gt;salvation is a gift (Eph. 2:8, 9), then what would be lacking or</i><br>
<i>&gt;incomplete about it?  Would it not be salvation to the uttermost, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;all eternity?</i><br>
<p>
I agree with this, but God does not always give us everything at once<br>
sometimes He gradually imparts things to us as we are able to bear them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  [....]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But we must never think that it is our works that earn us the</i><br>
<i>&gt;salvation.  The salvation is a gift, given freely by God because of</i><br>
<i>&gt;His grace and not our own merit.  Our works are part of the discipline</i><br>
<i>&gt;(in the instructional sense of that word) that we take on as God works</i><br>
<i>&gt;in our lives to conform us to the image of His Son (Rom. 8:29).</i><br>
<p>
Of cause not there is nothing we can do to of ourselves redeem ourselves <br>
from our lost condition. Christ is the only one who can redeem us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; [.,...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hope this helps to better explain my own understanding of salvation</i><br>
<i>&gt;and works.  And before someone asks, yes, I do believe that a person</i><br>
<i>&gt;who is saved is saved for eternity.</i><br>
<p>
Yep it does. However it raises one question. If when one is saved <br>
he/she is saved for eternity, then what happens when one falls from grace ?<br>
Being saved for eternity means never falling from grace. Do you believe<br>
one can never fall from grace ? There are examples in the scriptures<br>
where people did fall from grace.<br>
<p>
If as you say one is saved for eternity then all of his guilt has also been<br>
dealt with for eternity. But the scriptures say that even though our sins are<br>
forgiven they are not blotted out from the records in heaven untill the last <br>
day. How do you understand this ? How do you understand our salvation from <br>
the presence of sin and mortality ? Or are these things not actually<br>
part of "salvation" as such but need to be referred to by different vernacular ?<br>
<p>
Do you see savlation as something which we are completely awarded but not <br>
actually handed over in its entireity all at once ?<br>
<p>
Let me see, I think this is how I can best sum up my present understanding<br>
of what I mean by salvation, tell me if you agree.<br>
<p>
I don't think salvation is something that one gets all at once, however<br>
one is awarded and guaranteed complete and perfect salvation at conversion<br>
but that salvation is not completely fullfilled at the time of conversion.<br>
Part of it is, salvation from guilt and past sin and salvation from present<br>
sin (if the person wishes). The remaining part of salvation is progressively<br>
imparted to the person as it is required and the person is able to bear it,<br>
such as salvation from mortality. Yes he was awared the salvation from mortality<br>
at conversion but he does not actually receive this until the last day.<br>
So I see it as a path, while one is on the path the end result is guaranteed<br>
if one leaves the path, the final reward is forfitted. (note: I am not refering<br>
here to works or sanctification or anything like that even though it could<br>
be applied to the analogy). <br>
<p>
It becomes a bit like an interlocutory judgement (in legalease). Full rights<br>
to complete and perfect salvation is awarded to you now, it becomes yours. <br>
However you do not appropriate all of it at all at once, but it is apropriated<br>
at the specified time (for example immortality at 2nd coming).<br>
<p>
How does that sound ? any comments ?<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Ruben.<br>

Another impression from the visit of Dr. William Johnsson, Adventist<br>
Review editor, to the Hinsdale area.<br>
<p>
For lunch he joined the young adults which comprise the<br>
"Twentysomething" group in this area.  We had enjoyable conversation<br>
over dinner, including hearing his description of being on the John<br>
Ankerberg show.  <br>
<p>
Near the end of the meal he made a short statement, like so many heard<br>
before, along the lines "The church is losing its young people in North<br>
America.."..blah blah blah.  This despite the fact he was in a whole<br>
room full of the very target audience he was lamenting the loss of. <br>
<p>
When are people going to wake up and see that there are lots of people<br>
who don't have any particular gripe against the church, who are ready to<br>
be used and in many cases are being used?  We don't have time to fight<br>
the establishment because we are already part of it.  If every "I wish I<br>
could convince the youth to do....." were replaced with  "come on,<br>
youth, let's go do this."  I think we would have a lot more action.<br>
<p>
Also,  there is a whole new post-Baby Boom generation of young adults.  <br>
The post-Baby Boom generation includes me (I was born in 1965) and<br>
consideration needs to be given to the different experiences and values<br>
of this generation.<br>

I know the title sounds cynical.  Let me assure you before you read farther<br>
that I believe the Pathfinder clubs, our church's group for boys and<br>
girls ages 10-15 is a wonderful program that does a world of good for<br>
the kids.  I have been a Pathfinder and Pathfinder leader myself. <br>
Though I will describe an abuse of the system below, I personally told<br>
this leader that she was doing a great job.<br>
<p>
Over the past weekend I visited the small country church that is the<br>
home church of my parents and was my home church for five years.  On<br>
this particular Sabbath the Pathfinders had just returned from the<br>
Pathfinder fair.  The club from our church had been awarded the First<br>
Prize overall at the fair.  The fact that we have a club of fifteen<br>
Pathfinders in this town at all is amazing.  More amazing is that they<br>
are so well-organized and <br>
disciplined.  They showed a large panel of the various ribbons they had won,<br>
most of them first prizes.  Several pictures were snapped, various<br>
medals were awarded to some of the Pathfinders, and the Pathfinder<br>
leader spent several minutes telling us how proud we should be of our<br>
Pathfinders.<br>
<p>
Now, as long as parents are going to be proud of something, we can be glad<br>
that they have a good Pathfinder club to be proud of.  But I can't help<br>
but wonder if the desire to feed parental ego is one of the reasons the<br>
Pathfinder program has lasted these 50 years now.  Some parents stake so<br>
much of their own well-being in their kids that it can be emotionally<br>
damaging<br>
to both parent and child.  Perhaps if parents didn't feel the need to<br>
store so much pride in their kids, we wouldn't have so many emotionally<br>
damaged kids who are the ones that need the Pathfinder program the most.<br>

Here at the company where I work, and in the radio and TV news, the<br>
rumors/facts have been building to a cresendo about lay offs.  My<br>
company is still the largest private employer in the state of Oregon.<br>
<p>
Just a few minutes ago I received a phone call from my new manager<br>
to tell me that I'm one of those who will be staying with the company.<br>
<p>
And so I Praise the Lord, and pray for those less fortunate,<br>

<i>&gt; Steve, I would appreciate hearing the arguments against a Wednesday</i><br>
<i>&gt; crucifixion.  I have none and would like to be enlightened on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; SDA view of this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  -rhonda</i><br>
<p>
We have a couple of people in our church, one couple are Seventh-Day-Church<br>
of God, who subscribe to the Wednesday theory.  The S-D-C-G members<br>
find their own church too far away for regular attendance and so attend<br>
our church.<br>
<p>
Their main point of argument seems to be that when the Bible says a day<br>
it means a day and that day is 24 hours long.  And so they have Jesus<br>
dying Wednesday afternoon and rising Sabbath afternoon, precisely<br>
72 hours later.  They offer texts from the story of Jonah to try and<br>
prove their 72 hour theory.  The main answer to their 72 hour theory<br>
is the Jewish system that says any part of a day is a day.  So, do we<br>
take the Bible literaly in todays modern terms or do we try to understand<br>
the times and culture?<br>
<p>
I have a "Harmony of the Gospels" compiled by a Baptist theology<br>
professor in which he offers a foot note that argues from the Greek and<br>
Jewish culture that Jesus really arose very soon after sundown at the<br>
end of the Sabbath on the 1st day of the week.  In other words, early<br>
on the 1st day was early after sundown after the Sabbath ended.  Today<br>
we are in the habit of thinking of early the 1st day being early in<br>
the wee hours of the day.  At sunrise +/- a few hours.  It is clear<br>
as the King James reads it that Jesus was alive before the sun came<br>
up.  But you have to understand Jewish reconing and the Greek to see<br>
that He could have been alive quite soon after sundown, which would<br>
be Saturday night in todays vernacular.  The women were constrained<br>
in what they could do with His body during the Sabbath hours.  Right<br>
after sundown they would be free to light up their lamps and rush to<br>
the tomb, to find the tomb already empty.<br>
<p>
If you accept Jewish reconing, which I have confirmed with modern<br>
Jewish friends, then Friday afternoon was the 1st day, the Sabbath<br>
the 2nd day and the early hours of Sunday the 3'd day.  And even if<br>
that totaled, lets say, 26 hours = 1 + 24 + 1 hours, then that<br>
would still be three days of Jewish reconing.<br>
<p>
True, I have over simplified the whole question from their point of<br>
view.  But I think I've covered the may objection.<br>
<p>

I've never written before so before I start I'd like to introduce<br>
myself. My name is Joanne Figueiredo and I'm a senior Education/Psychology<br>
major at Atlantic Union College in Massachusetts. I'm working full time<br>
this summer at Stratus Computer in MA. I've really enjoyed reading all<br>
the messages sent in to this net. <br>
<p>
Cheryl says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; .......................................... There is not predisposition</i><br>
<i>&gt;genetically to be a nontither.  I have been a member of the an SDA church</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the past where the head elder regularly took his family skiing on</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sabbath, other elders drank alcohol socially, and the wives wore furs and</i><br>
<i>&gt;gaudy jewelry to church.  These items are more appropriate measures of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"conformity to church standards" than obestiy.  However, whenever we start</i><br>
<i>&gt;judging others based on outward appearances, we are not following God's way.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what tithing has to do with the other things mentioned, but<br>
on the subject of judging others based on outward appearances, I totally<br>
agree. This subject has been one that I recently discussed with some close<br>
friends and I couldn't believe their thoughts on it. One of these friends<br>
is a "pastor's kid" and she is in total agreement that leaders of our church<br>
should be an example, therefore doing all the things like paying tithe, not<br>
going to movies, etc. And I disagree in a way. I think our leaders should be<br>
a good example but, if they are doing these things only to hold an example,<br>
but deep down they don't feel like they should, then they are not being <br>
honest. For example, I know a pastor who does not object to going and seeing<br>
a movie and because he was honest enough to say that, he was kept from a<br>
higher position (there were other factors as well). Now, I respect him <br>
because he wasn't going to hide the fact, in other words, he wasn't going<br>
to be two-faced. I am finding so much of this in the church (although, I'm<br>
sure other churches have similar problems so I'm not in any way turned off<br>
from the church). <br>
<p>
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm tired of people judging other<br>
people based on outward appearances. The example that Cheryl gave:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I doubt the disciple known as Simon, later called Peter, would have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;given an SDA church office. Yet Jesus called him personally and through</i><br>
<i>&gt;his association with Christ became a powerful church leader. </i><br>
<p>
I think this is an excellent example. Yes, leaders should be true followers<br>
of God, but how many humans do you know are perfect?? I think we have to<br>
stop putting so much stock behind maintaining appearances, and start looking<br>
within. If pastors (leaders) have problems, hey, thats o.k., they are human,<br>
but no one should go around, including them, acting as if everything is<br>
perfect. Now, we could start off on what sort of things should be allowed, <br>
and what shouldn't but I've found that when it comes right down to it, we<br>
all have different opinions, and thats o.k. But lets at least try to be more<br>
honest with ourselves. I want to end with one more example:<br>
<p>
This past weekend, as I mentioned before, I was with a few close friends. We<br>
had decided to spend the weekend together since her parents were out of<br>
town. We got together Friday night and had decided that on Sabbath we would<br>
go for a picnic at a state park. Now, we could have prepared everything before<br>
Friday night, but we didn't. So we went to the store on Friday night. Now,<br>
I had a problem with it in the sense that I felt uncomfortable breaking the<br>
sabbath that I believe in. My friend felt uncomfortable because she was afraid<br>
we would run into someone we knew and that would just be awful for her. So,<br>
what really is more important?? I didn't say anything to her about it because<br>
I knew she would make some excuse for it.<br>
<p>
Besides wanting more honesty, I'm also wanting consistency. I know I'm not<br>
always like that, but I can admit it and in times of uncertainty, I go to<br>
the Bible for answers or to people who I respect who have these qualities.  <br>
I think thats all we can do. But lets always remember that God loves <br>
EVERYONE and we cannot take his place in judging others. <br>
<p>
Thanks for listening!! Have a happy Sabbath!!<br>
     ~Joanne<br>

One Jewish friend I asked -- what is a High Sabbath -- he did not know,<br>
but guessed that it was perhaps simply Passover and the Day of Atonement.<br>
The most important annual Sabbaths of the year.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Glen posted:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"This is an interesting issue.  Most of us would agree that there has</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to be some discrimination for church office, but how do you decide?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;For example, I think a person who is grossly overweight (temperance)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;but pays tithe is no more qualified for church office than someone of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;normal weight who doesn't pay tithe.  However, if the church started</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;REALLY enforcing this kind of rule, there would be an uproar.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"</i><br>
<p>
Cheryl replied:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Glen is assuming that obesity is caused by intemperance.  This is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessarily the case.  In fact, science is discovering that the genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;predisposition to obesity is very real and that many people struggle all</i><br>
<i>&gt;their life with an image that they grossly indulge when this is not the</i><br>
<i>&gt;case.  For many, obesity is something they struggle with all their life</i><br>
<i>&gt;and there seems to be very little they can do about it.  Tithing on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;other hand is just a choice and commitment.  There is not predisposition</i><br>
<i>&gt;genetically to be a nontither.  I have been a member of the an SDA church</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the past where the head elder regularly took his family skiing on</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sabbath, other elders drank alcohol socially, and the wives wore furs and</i><br>
<i>&gt;gaudy jewelry to church.  These items are more appropriate measures of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"conformity to church standards" than obestiy.  However, whenever we start</i><br>
<i>&gt;judging others based on outward appearances, we are not following God's</i><br>
<i>&gt;way.  I think the SDA church organization which has members of the local</i><br>
<i>&gt;church selecting individuals for church office will encourage the use of</i><br>
<i>&gt;outward appearance and behavior patterns in the selection process.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;LDS church, on the other hand, offers "calls" for all church positions</i><br>
<i>&gt;based on the decision of the bishopric (lay leaders) of the ward.  </i><br>
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
<p>
Sounds somewhat similar to a type of "nominating committee".  That is what<br>
our nominating committees are supposed to do.  At the church that I am now<br>
attending, forms were passed out for every member of the church to list <br>
their preferences/"callings" for specific positions within the church.  The<br>
nominating committee took these as suggestions for service and then prayerfully<br>
selected individuals to fill the posts.  Each of the posts was filled AFTER<br>
the person selected had been given an opportunity to accept or refuse the<br>
call.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sometimes</i><br>
<i>&gt;individuals are given an assignment, not because they are "worthy" but</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather to give them an opportunity for spiritual and personal growth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For example, I doubt the disciple known as Simon, later called Peter, would</i><br>
<i>&gt;have been given an SDA church office.  Yet Jesus called him personally and</i><br>
<i>&gt;through his association with Christ became a powerful church leader.</i><br>
<p>
What is your reasoning here?  It is a moot point in any case.  We can <br>
speculate all that we want about what MIGHT have been our COULD have<br>
been.  We just won't KNOW what WOULD have BEEN had this had opportunity.<br>
To make such a blanket statement is also rather uncharitable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another issue in the nomination of church officers in the SDA church is</i><br>
<i>&gt;that many times the nominating committee cannot find anyone "willing" to</i><br>
<i>&gt;accept an appointment.  For example, the SDA church in Salt Lake City has</i><br>
<i>&gt;always had trouble finding anyone willing to lead the Earliteen &amp; Junior</i><br>
<i>&gt;divisions.  We also had several Sabbaths that the cradle roll and kindergarten</i><br>
<i>&gt;teachers just didn't show.  I don't know how prevalent these kinds of</i><br>
<i>&gt;problems are across the US, but how does the local church deal with these?</i><br>
<p>
As with any office that is left open, it becomes the responsibility of the <br>
local church to fill it.  When you have people who may be unprepared to accept<br>
the responsability of a position, forcing someone to take it is wrong.  Usually,<br>
a person will step forward who may have had some interest and will work into<br>
the position until a more suitable replacement can be found.<br>
<p>
As far as a person not showing up for the class or program.  It depends.  At <br>
a small church I used to attend, we had to deal with this as an ongoing <br>
problem.  Not that the teachers were negligent, but that with only a single<br>
person for some classes, it made it difficult to work with when the person was<br>
out of town or sick.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cheryl Berthelsen</i><br>
<i>&gt;cberthel@cc.utah.edu</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It does seem that people are making too much of the tithe issue and the <br>
nominating committee.  I served on two nominating committees during recent <br>
years.  The only question that was asked by the committee of the treasurer<br>
was if the person appeared to be faithful in their tithes and offerrings.<br>
<p>
This was settled with a simple yes or no.  There was no question to the<br>
amount of the tithe or offerrings.  It was just to ensure that the <br>
individual had some level of commitment to the church that they were being<br>
asked to serve.<br>

  Funny, I think it was last year we had that discussion last year here<br>
at work.  You missed one thing, Jesus said that like Jonah he would be<br>
dead 3 days AND 3 nights.<br>

And so I ask, what really is love [agape].  What texts can you offer<br>
to illuminate this question?   Or must we consult the overall fabric<br>
of the Bible record from cover to cover?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
DaveB<br>
-------<br>
<p>
Hi Dave,<br>
<p>
Very good questions.  May I answer the second one first?<br>
<p>
A2:  Yes, we must.  "On these two commandments [to love God and to<br>
love our neighbor] the whole law hangeth, and the prophets."  Mt22:40.<br>
If you want to understand the depths of God's love for his elect, and<br>
if you want to understand how to express your love to your God and to <br>
your neighbor, you must look to the whole of God's revelation.<br>
<p>
<p>
A1:  Having said that, I will offer a succinct answer to your first<br>
question.  It is found in Luke 10:25-37.  But he [a lawyer],<br>
desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my<br>
neighbor?  [Insert story of the good Samaritan.]  Bottom line:<br>
Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that<br>
fell among the robbers?  And he said, He that showed mercy on him.<br>
And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.<br>
<p>
There are, of course, many more biblical examples of what is love.<br>
Your question seemed to focus upon love among the brethren.<br>
<p>
God bless,<br>
Dan Blake<br>

[Steven Timm writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; Over the past weekend I visited the small country church that is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; home church of my parents and was my home church for five years.  On</i><br>
<i>&gt; this particular Sabbath the Pathfinders had just returned from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pathfinder fair.  The club from our church had been awarded the First</i><br>
<i>&gt; Prize overall at the fair.  The fact that we have a club of fifteen</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pathfinders in this town at all is amazing.  More amazing is that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are so well-organized and </i><br>
<i>&gt; disciplined.  They showed a large panel of the various ribbons they had won,</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of them first prizes.  Several pictures were snapped, various</i><br>
<i>&gt; medals were awarded to some of the Pathfinders, and the Pathfinder</i><br>
<i>&gt; leader spent several minutes telling us how proud we should be of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pathfinders.</i><br>
<p>
I have cautions about competitions in general, esp competitions in church<br>
activities.  Pathfinders is not the only area.  Colporteur sales awards<br>
are another area I have reservations on.  Btw, I find "Pastor so and so<br>
won so many souls this year" to be reasonably similar.  All the glory and<br>
praise should go to God!  (Rev1:6; note the elders' and beasts' frequent<br>
praises elsewhere in Revelation).  We should thank God for books sold<br>
and souls won, etc.  Of ourselves, we can do nothing (Acts17:28a).<br>
<p>
So, what do we say to and about people?<br>
<p>
It is appropriate to express appreciation for people's character traits<br>
and to thank them when they have been of service.  Have Johnny or Suzy<br>
been diligent in accomplishing something?  Recognize their diligence.<br>
Have Randy or Renee been helpful, of service to others?  Recognize their<br>
service.  Who has shown patience and persistence in a difficult situation?<br>
Recognize them for that.  Someone learning to profitably use their time<br>
(Ps90:12, Eph5:16)? Etc, etc.  This is particularly important for parents,<br>
but also applies corporately.<br>
<p>
p.s.  Are there not often several first's and several second's, etc at<br>
Pathfinder fairs? I have seen such at least once or twice at the few fairs<br>
I've been to.  This, at least, mitigates some problems with competition.<br>

Steve, you speak as one who has not yet experienced the legitimate pride of<br>
parenthood!  <br>
<p>
On the other side of the coin, there is the fantastic self-esteem that is<br>
built into kinds who "can" and "do."  <br>
<p>
Perhaps the worship service is not the best place to show off, but when our<br>
kids are doing anything right and good, they need to hear about it.<br>

Interestingly, the word translated as "day of preparation" in the stories<br>
of Christ's crucifixion means much more.  Paraskeue is the name for <br>
Friday.  This name was common among Jews and early Christians.  Friday<br>
was the "Day of Preparation" just as Sabbath was the "Day of Rest"--which<br>
is the meaning in Hebrew.<br>
<p>
As one reads the story in Mark 15:42-16:2 and in Luke 23:54-24:1, there is <br>
no possibility of reading Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Sabbath into the <br>
outline of days provided.  The whole context is important.<br>

I have been asked to serve as part of a focus group to review the new <br>
magazine "View" which has just published a limited-distribution trial <br>
issue.  Their target audience is SDA's in their 20's no matter the<br>
background.  (This is a remarkable response seeing I just made a call<br>
for something for this group two days ago on SDAnet, but I digress.)<br>
<p>
The magazine is published by the Church ministries department of North<br>
American Division, edited by Celeste Ryan.  The first issue included a <br>
summary of the meeting of Folkenberg's Youth Cabinet, a list of resources,<br>
an article about AIDS, an interview with A.C. McClure, and an article<br>
by Patti Nash of Columbia Union College entitled "Why I Stay."<br>
<p>
This magazine is a large 8-page in broadside format, printed on hi-grade<br>
newsprint.  It uses 2-color technology.  The format is appealing, the<br>
articles are interesting, and I think this magazine may well enjoy a<br>
bright future.  I will give a favorable report to the focus group.  <br>

<i>&gt;Steve, you speak as one who has not yet experienced the legitimate pride of</i><br>
<i>&gt;parenthood!  </i><br>
<i>&gt;On the other side of the coin, there is the fantastic self-esteem that is</i><br>
<i>&gt;built into kinds who "can" and "do."  </i><br>
<p>
After an extensive search of my Bible and the writings of Ellen White,<br>
I fail to find record of any pride that is legitimate or any self-esteem<br>
that is fantastic.  (With the exception of boasting in the cross of Christ.)<br>
They are both sins by definition as far as I can tell.  I will be glad to <br>
consider any inspired quotes to the contrary.  Furthermore, people like<br>
Dr. Dobson try to tell us that self-esteem is good, but the scientific<br>
data just isn't there.  The California self-esteem study failed to find<br>
any correlation between level of self-esteem and success in life, and<br>
this was one of the most exhaustive studies that has ever been done.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Perhaps the worship service is not the best place to show off, but when our</i><br>
<i>&gt;kids are doing anything right and good, they need to hear about it.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that our kids need to hear that they have done a good job, but<br>
this is totally separate from self-esteem in any way (at least as I<br>
define it and <br>
as the dictionary defines it--"pride in oneself.")  Usually when I have<br>
this argument with people I find they are defining self-esteem in a<br>
different way which I would be more likely to call self-worth or<br>
self-concept (both of which are essential for emotionally healthy<br>
children and which I promote.)<br>

I recall Ellen White uses the phrase "a mother's natural pride" one or<br>
more places.  I don't recall where but could probably find it after a<br>
bit of searching.<br>

Very true.  It is difficult to focus on the "my opinion is only my <br>
opinion" side<br>
when reverting to "my opinion is God's opinion, and all else is naught."<br>
<p>
Howerve, let's not faulter at that which is diffcult, but with Christ, <br>
move above<br>
and beyond it.<br>

Dear Steve,<br>
     When i downloaded my latest mail packet from the BBS and read it, i was<br>
at first quite shocked and horrified at some of the things written therein<br>
(about homosexuality especially), because they seem to express views so<br>
different from what i would expect from SDAs. I was really quite aghast at it<br>
all, and i still am. But after i went over it again a couple of times i felt<br>
it so funny that i couldn't help laughing out loud, because of this:<br>
<p>
     I've been on SDAnet since November last year, when i first got in, i<br>
almost got in trouble with the trustees of the E G White Estate for offering<br>
to give out copies of Steps to Christ and other inspiring inspired writings,<br>
like autumn leaves, then someone called Admir was having a hard time from<br>
church elders for chewing gum in church and so we discussed that for a while,<br>
and since then we've had many hot discussions on everything from whether the<br>
NIV is of the antichrist to baptism and euthanasia; and while these are real<br>
issues, sometimes when i look back at us SDAnetters discussing them until we<br>
get all worked up over bizarre things and it looks laughable.<br>
<p>
     Also, i have acquired impressions about the characters and views of<br>
various regular SDAnetters, although i have never met them in person. As<br>
such, many of their responses and reactions have become predictable. I mean,<br>
if you throw up a question about, say prostitution or ecumenism, you can<br>
almost guess who will say what. Well, i tried to imagine all the various<br>
SDAnetters in the same congregation, and it looked like a most unlikely crowd<br>
indeed that was what made me laugh. What i am getting to is this: The<br>
Seventh-day Adventist Church today is not at all as homogeneous or united as<br>
i used to think it was. There is actually a very large variance of thought<br>
and practice within it. Now, the church should have variety and differences,<br>
just as the body has different organs for different functions, but they all<br>
need to work together and have certain basic things in common, a mutual goal<br>
and mission, certain shared a-priori principles to work by. The speaker at<br>
one of our youth praise and worship meetings last year, Del Johnson, gave a<br>
vivid illustration, which i think says it well: Our theme was unity in<br>
diversity, in the body of Christ, and he gave a presentation on that. He<br>
concocted an ice-cream dish on stage, getting a volunteer from the audience<br>
to help him add all the ingredients, various flavours of ice cream, nuts,<br>
chocolate syrup etc, until it (supposedly) looked really delicious with all<br>
the varieties of stuff on it, then he asked the volunteer if he'd like to eat<br>
it, and of course he responded in the affirmative. He then got a can of<br>
engine oil and poured it in, and asked the same question, which was now<br>
answered "no".<br>
<p>
     I think we as a church, really need to get our act together and decide<br>
what we believe etc. Please pray for the church. Most of all, we all need the<br>
love of God.<br>
<p>
     One of the great divides in the SDA church seems to be between the<br>
"liberals" and "conservatives". Though there are the extremists at both ends<br>
which are really far out, i think the vast majority  of these people actually<br>
agree with each other, it is just that their emphasis is different.<br>
     The conservatives see the influence of the world infiltrating the<br>
church, they see church standards and even basic bible doctrines being eroded<br>
and being treated with less and less importance. They therefore place great<br>
emphasis on behaviour and good works, church standards and correct doctrine,<br>
and calling sin by its right name. They believe in salvation by grace through<br>
faith, but are afraid to stress it lest it open the floodgates of iniquity.<br>
They fear that if people think that we are not saved by good works, they will<br>
become lawless and decadent.<br>
     The liberals, in part at least, are reacting to what they perceive as<br>
the teaching of salvation by works, from the conservatives. They stress the<br>
love and grace of God, and the freeness of the gift of salvation, that it is<br>
not at all by works, lest any man boast. While they do not emphasize the<br>
importance of church standards or correct behaviour, because they fear that<br>
that will give people the impression that we are saved by works, they do<br>
agree with it and support it.<br>
     Perhaps that is over-simplifying it but i think that's roughly how it<br>
is. I personally agree with both of these groups, but i feel that we need to<br>
get a balanced picture of what we believe, so that we don't confuse people.<br>
It is *not* however, a question of doing a "balancing act" or walking in the<br>
"middle of the road" or of "compromise" because there is nothing to<br>
compromise. Both of these viewpoints, though presented in a one-sided way,<br>
are equally valid and necessary. They are two sides of the same coin, or<br>
better, they are the two metals that make up the alloy of the coin. They are<br>
part and parcel of the same system of practical Christian truth. When viewed<br>
with the correct perspective, from the bible with the Holy Spirit as<br>
interpreter, there is no conflict at all, between free salvation by grace<br>
alone, and the importance of good works. It all makes perfect sense.<br>
<p>
     One thing i have realised is that we should never take for granted that<br>
even our fellow church members have the same understanding of Adventist truth<br>
that we do. Many SDAs, even some who have been in the church for years, do<br>
not have a clear understanding of even the very basics of Christian doctrine.<br>
In this year's youth commission survey for the Far Eastern Division, it was<br>
found that 88% of baptised, SDA youth in the FED answered "yes" to the<br>
question "in order for God to accept me, i must live a good life" while 64%<br>
said that the Adventist faith is a legalistic religion, and only 59% said<br>
that they knew that if Jesus were to return now, they would be saved. Now,<br>
what does this show about what these people have been taught to believe?<br>
Almost half of them have no assurance of salvation, and seem to believe in<br>
salvation by works!!!<br>
<p>
     Speaking about adventist behaviour, i have a friend who used to attend<br>
church, but left because she felt that she didn't measure up to being a<br>
Christian and somehow God could not accept her. Anyway, she went to the US<br>
recently for a holiday, and she tells me that she went to Las Vegas to see<br>
what all the hype about it was, with a friend who is a regular church-going<br>
SDA, and she found the city eerie and weird, because it seemed to her to run<br>
on gambling and sleeze and not much else, and she didn't like it there. But<br>
this is what perturbed me, her SDA friend who brought her there, went there<br>
to gamble! And she said that that puzzled her, because she used to believe<br>
that Christian people don't do certain things, and gambling was one of them.<br>
Well, i can't say that i'm surprised about it now, but i still wish that that<br>
SDA hadn't done that, because it has helped confuse my friend even more. Why<br>
am i writing about all this? I don't know, but i just want to say that we<br>
should always be conscious that people are looking to us and watching us,<br>
because they expect Christians to be Christlike, and by our behaviour we can<br>
sometimes be a stumbling block to others. I am not saying we should put up an<br>
act and pretend to be holy or something, but.... i don't know. I am just in<br>
a sort of identity crisis about the church i belong to -- the SDA church. I<br>
don't like to speak discouragement, but frankly, some of the things in the<br>
SDA church make me sick. God says it makes Him sick too:<br>
<p>
"So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue<br>
thee out of my mouth." Rev 3:16<br>
<p>
The message continues:<br>
<p>
"17 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need<br>
of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor,<br>
and blind, and naked: 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire,<br>
that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and<br>
that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with<br>
eyesalve, that thou mayest see. 19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten:<br>
be zealous therefore, and repent. 20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock:<br>
if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will<br>
sup with him, and he with me. 21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit<br>
with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father<br>
in his throne. 22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith<br>
unto the churches."<br>
<p>
I am not in a position to speak like this; when i look at my own life, i see<br>
it full of sin and selfishness, and i am as much to blame as anybody else,<br>
for the condition of things, but i just wish that the church as a whole would<br>
"wake up its idea" and be more "on the ball", to borrow phrases they use in<br>
the Army here. If we don't get our act together, how do we expect to be able<br>
to reach people like those "atheists" in your post?<br>
<p>
About those atheists, most of their questions sound reasonable and valid, and<br>
i think i would ask them myself, if i were in their shoes, with very little<br>
knowledge of the truth. Some of them seem to be the result of the erroneous<br>
teachings of the babel of religious confusion, like the question about<br>
eternal torment in hell; and others seem to stem from a confused idea about<br>
salvation and justice, which disappears when one understands better the<br>
issues of the great controversy between Christ and Satan, and the nature of<br>
the sin problem and how we gain salvation. If those questions are all that's<br>
keeping them from becoming believers, i suggest we pray for them, and tell<br>
them the truth just as it is in Jesus. If they are honest in their search for<br>
truth, the Holy Spirit will be able to convict them of the truth. Truth can<br>
stand for itself, all we have to do is tell it to them. The gospel is so<br>
simple even a child can understand it. If they are willing to know the truth,<br>
they shall know it, and the truth will set them free, then they shall be free<br>
thinkers indeed.<br>
<p>
About the homosexual discussion, i needn't have started it in the first<br>
place. What happened was that the gay pastor who convinced my friend that it<br>
is right to be gay, according to the bible, sent him a sheaf of literature<br>
about it, and it said that the bible doesn't mention female homosexuality, so<br>
i searched for it in the concordance and couldn't find anything. That's why<br>
i sent a post out asking for scriptural support. When i read the rest of the<br>
articles however, i found that i needn't have bothered. The gay pastor had<br>
listed out conveniently, all the texts in the bible that have to do with<br>
homosexuality, so that he could explain them away, and the text i was looking<br>
for was there.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; kinesthetic learner?  For years the church service has been something to </i><br>

<i>&gt; NLP here we come ! doesn't the bible say that faith comes through</i><br>

When I was a sI was very sick, and my parents talked bye themselves<br>
if I would at all manage. Soon I learned to shut off all these talks.<br>
I think this is the reason why I do not hear really whta people say,<br>
but if somebody writes a picture everything is clear. In sermons I fall asleep.<br>
Does this mean - Ruben - that I cannot be saved?<br>

<i>&gt; She has now convinced herself that the Catholic church is much more friendly</i><br>

Steve:<br>
<p>
She must be thinking of a different Catholic Church from the one that's<br>
been criticized loud and long by feminists for continuing to be a<br>
reactionary bastion of male domination.  It puts me in mind of the story<br>
of how Pope John Paul II, on one of his visits to America, was<br>
instructed to walk across the tarmac and kiss the women in the<br>
delegation when he got off the plane.  But he got his directions mixed<br>
up and he ended up kissing the tarmac and walking across the women.<br>

 Steve:<br>
 As someone who was an Episcopalean before converting to Seventh-day<br>
 Adventism in my teen years, let me put my two cents in:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1)  There's precious little difference between Episcopals and Catholics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Still enough to make the Catholics call the Episcopals damnable heretics, </i><br>
<i>&gt; (Episcopals break the wafer of bread as they consecrate it) but not much </i><br>
<i>&gt; else.  I believe the word "Protestant" was struck from the title </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Protestant Episcopal" some time ago.  (check me on this?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
True enough; both are what are called "high churches" due to their<br>
liturgical style.  The differences between them, however, are a touch<br>
more serious.<br>
<p>
The Episcopal Church started as the Anglican Church, formed by Henry<br>
VIII pretty much because he felt that the sovreign of England should<br>
have more say in church matters than the bishop of Rome.  There have<br>
been attempts to reunite the two parties (Anglicans and Catholics) but<br>
recognizing the primacy of Rome has long been a sticking point.  And now<br>
that the Anglican Church has taken steps toward allowing the ordination<br>
of women (which the Vatican still rabidly opposes) the reconciliation<br>
may be delayed even longer.<br>
<p>
The problem with being an Anglican was that you recognized the<br>
King/Queen of England as head of the church and "Defender of the Faith"<br>
-- a rather untenable position in the year 1776.  The Episcopal Church<br>
was formed as a domestic product: the rites were retained but ties to<br>
the mother church in England were severed.<br>
<p>
(Just a thought: the system whereby the English sovereign becomes the<br>
"Defender of the Faith" is a good argument against the establishment of<br>
religion.  Can you picture Prince Charles having anything serious to say<br>
about religion, especially considering his relationship with Di?)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2)  Both find ways to involve young people as integral parts of the service.</i><br>
<i>&gt; With all the crosses, candles, and whatnot to lug around, several acolytes</i><br>
<i>&gt; and crucifers are needed.  In the Episcopal tradition, acolytes can be girls</i><br>
<i>&gt; as well as boys, and a news item indicated that Catholics are thinking </i><br>
<i>&gt; about allowing this, too.  What would an SDA service look like with two</i><br>
<i>&gt; young people serving communion on either side of the pastor?  Couldn't hurt?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or is it pagan by definition because the Catholics do it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I started in the Episcopal Church when I was about 8, singing in the<br>
choir on Sunday mornings.  It wasn't that I was religious -- I wanted an<br>
excuse to get out of the house in case my Dad woke up hung over.  But<br>
choir members were the low end of the food chain; acolytes let it be<br>
known that they outranked me.  Then again, maybe we just had some rotten<br>
kids as acolytes.  And in the early to mid-Sixties, girls were NOT<br>
allowed to be acolytes -- that was a later development.<br>
<p>
I've come across articles that deal with child participation in<br>
RECEIVING communion ("'Mommy, may I have a sip?'" by Carl Hartman,<br>
_Ministry_, Feb 1992, p. 19, and Letters in reply, _Ministry_, Oct<br>
1992), but this is the first I've heard anyone suggest kids assist in<br>
ADMINISTERING communion.  My guess is that local elders would 86 that<br>
proposal, and not necessarily because it could be considered a "Roman"<br>
practice.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)  You never have a first elder stumbling through an impromptu prayer</i><br>
<i>&gt; because the order of prayer is always predetermined.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4)  On the con side, singing the same liturgy every week would get slightly</i><br>
<i>&gt; boring.  But you do have to be on your toes to follow it all at first.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There's no sitting back and sleeping for 40 minutes, participation is </i><br>
<i>&gt; required every step of the way except during the 10-15 minute sermon.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
You have to take both into consideration: the set liturgy eliminated the<br>
guesswork but it does make for a boring service.  Of course you do have<br>
the "Book of Common Prayer" to guide you through the order of worship.<br>
Trouble is, revising the worship service can cause major ideological<br>
battles (about the use of sexist language and whatnot).  And while the<br>
prayer may not be impromptu, there's no guarantee that the speaker will<br>
be up to the material.  I remember one priest who assisted at a church I<br>
attended, St. Paul's Episcopal back in Illinois.  He was a nice enough<br>
gentleman but his palsied readings could get on your nerves; it was<br>
something of a relief when he retired.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So how did the SDA form of worship become mostly like the Baptist liturgy?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Baptists weren't prominent in the early SDA church, were they?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Both denominations are so-called "spiritual experience" denominations</i><br>
<i>&gt; which place large emphasis on preaching as opposed to corporate worship</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and expect their ministers to uphold high moral standard).  That's</i><br>
<i>&gt; all I can think.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I'm no expert on Adventist liturgy (though I always thought they owed<br>
more to Methodism than to the Baptists).  And I'm not very nostalgic<br>
about high church form (although I must confess that I get a kick out<br>
of looking through church supply catalogs at the robes, vestments,<br>
copes, paraments, etc. -- even the names of the articles have a<br>
beautiful, exotic quality).<br>
<p>
Still, no matter how beautiful a form public worship can take, the<br>
danger is that it could slip into empty theatricality -- which is<br>
another way of saying that it assumes a form of godliness without the<br>
power thereof.  Besides, the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers<br>
is a good argument for a clergy that can't be distinguished by fancy<br>
vestments.<br>
<p>
Finally, let me just say that it all comes down to the people.  Father<br>
Duran, back at St. Michael and All Angels Church in Illinois, was simply<br>
a really great guy.  A faulty clergyman, in any denomination, can make<br>
the spiritual life difficult for his people.<br>
<p>
Of course some people in the congregation can be difficult themselves.<br>
I have somewhere in my files a clipping about a parish priest of a<br>
Catholic church in Wisconsin.  He was great at involving kids in the<br>
service, including girls, and the kids loved him for it.  One of the<br>
parishoners who didn't like the idea of girls being involved in public<br>
worship registered his complaint with the priest by killing him with a<br>
handgun.  But that's another topic on the bulletin board.<br>

<i>&gt; 2) If god is so just, good, and loving, and if god wants to save us so bad, w</i><br>
<i>&gt;    doesn't he show himself to all the people in the world at once? That's </i><br>
<i>&gt;    the sure way to get everybody converted.</i><br>
<p>
Yea this is called Satans impersonation of Christ, and boy won't<br>
the whole world be converted. !<br>
&lt;---<br>
<p>
So why doesn't God get in first? Not that I have an answer, but I think the<br>
original question is a fair one.<br>
<p>
---&gt;<br>
I note that a sizeable proportion of these might be probs to a lot of <br>
evangelicals, but should be pno problem for SDAs.<br>
&lt;---<br>
<p>
Still worth thinking about though! It's amazing how many things a person<br>
can believe without having compelling reasons. Or, from another angle, many<br>
things which may be compelling to one are certainly not to another!<br>
<p>
Take the question "Why are you a Christian/Why do you believe in God?"<br>
<p>
For many of us, the *honest* answer is "Because I was born into a Christian<br>
family and brought up that way". Now I'm not saying that other reasons haven't<br>
come along for any of us. But I've often thought myself that if I was brought<br>
up an agnostic, and went to uni to do the study I've done and am doing, it is<br>
highly unlikely that I would have been converted to Christianity. Unless the<br>
Holy Spirit did a special job on me! <br>
<p>
The secondary answer to the question is "Because as a Christian my belief<br>
system allows me to make sense of the world". This is still not concrete by<br>
any means, because many would say that Christianity made no sense at all!<br>
<p>
There are two ways to answer many of the questions. The honest way and the<br>
evangelistic way. Both have their uses, and its worth thinking about the<br>
questions both ways.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or, the grass is always greener over the septic tank</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't remember the percentage of people that leave the SDA church over</i><br>
<i>&gt; some conflict with some person, but it is large.  I suspect that even </i><br>
<i>&gt; this figure is underreported, because some of the people who have left</i><br>
<i>&gt; over doctrinal disagreements have come to these disagreements during</i><br>
<i>&gt; conflict with people or organization of the church, which may have had</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing to do with the doctrine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
[deleted much about Catholic and LDS conversions]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What does this tell us?  It points out that if the written words of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; doctrine fail to match up to the practice of the doctrine, people notice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a gut-level emotional reaction, which is the opposite of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; initial reaction that comes with conviction of truth.  There can be a </i><br>
<i>&gt; positive side for this, because it is frequently such a reaction that</i><br>
<i>&gt; leads people to search out the SDA church.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thoughts?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I can speak from a unique perspective.<br>
<p>
We need to stop looking at ourselves as the true church and see outselves<br>
for what we really are: the repository of God's truth for these last days.<br>
 There has become a focus more on what SDA's believe than on what God<br>
teaches.  In a way we have lost our focus.  We are more interested in<br>
membership than in faith.  We are becoming more and more like our natural<br>
counterparts the Jews.<br>
<p>
As I noted in an earlier post, I am a SDA pastor on study leave.  In<br>
October of last year the church I attended forced me off the organ in the<br>
middle of the divine service and stopped me from instructing the Youth<br>
Sabbath class I was leading.  The only reason was because I was opposed to<br>
the pastor's advice to the church to seek legal injunctions to keep a<br>
Davidian college student from the church premises.<br>
<p>
That same month I wrote to the local conference, with copies to the<br>
Union and GC, asking them to look into this adoption of Babylonian behavior.  <br>
To this date I have not received so much as a note of acknowledgement.  Not <br>
only is this unprofessional and rude; if we are too busy balancing budgets<br>
and making policy to be concerned that one of our churches is going astray<br>
then we are really too busy.<br>
<p>
I still believe the message of the SDA church but I refuse to be<br>
held hostage by a church hierarchy which will do whatever it can get away<br>
with to keep our churches filled.  If we have the truth why are we so<br>
scared of dealing with those who violate church policy?  We act quickly<br>
when a young woman gets pregnant but excuse the more dangerous actions of<br>
those who lead.<br>
<p>
I don't ask for an apology from the church.  My salvation is from God. <br>
But a church which is too proud to admit when it has treated one of God's<br>
children does not have any authority discipline God's children. We have<br>
sacrificed our principles at the altar of membership and budgets.  That is<br>
not reflective of the God I serve.<br>
<p>
I never thought I would see the day when an Adventist church would lock<br>
its doors on Sabbath to keep people out, or call police on to the premises<br>
to take people away who were only interested in coming to worship.  If<br>
this is acceptable behavior then God must be dead.  I know He is not for<br>
He has done too much for me.<br>
<p>
I would prefer to fellowship with those who believe as I do.  But a church<br>
which is policed by civil authorities and drags me off their organ at the<br>
same time they pay a member of the local Baptist church to play the piano,<br>
with the explanation that this is a form of soul winning, shows no<br>
interest in my salvation and is not a place I desire to fellowship.  <br>
<p>
Sadly, both churches in town chose to use their own remedies and called<br>
the cops in.  I wonder, if this is how the church relates to one who has<br>
the pastoral gift, how are other members treated.  No wonder they leave. <br>
My only prayer is that soon this will be put right.<br>

---&gt;<br>
If the audience does not accept the underlying hypotheses,<br>
why should we expect anyone to listen to the arguments?<br>
&lt;---<br>
<p>
Because you don't have to agree with someone to listen to them.<br>
<p>
Listening to a person explain what their hypotheses are, and how<br>
that relates to their opinion on something, can help us understand<br>
where they're coming from. It can show that a person's position<br>
is at least internally consistent, even if it is based on <br>
hypotheses another person may not accept.<br>
<p>
The fact that two parties may never agree does not mean that they<br>
can't listen and relate to one another. It often means they *won't*,<br>
but it doesn't have to. There is a difference between discussion<br>
and debate; I'm sure there is room for both on SDAnet, providing<br>
there is more of "my opinion is only my opinion", and less of "your<br>
opinion is only your opinion"!<br>
<p>
In my opinion, of course...!<br>

<i>&gt;  What would an SDA service look like with two</i><br>
<i>&gt; young people serving communion on either side of the pastor?  Couldn't hurt?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or is it pagan by definition because the Catholics do it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
yep.	:^)<br>
<p>
Why don't you ask this question of someone who has "come out" of the<br>
RCC communion ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3)  You never have a first elder stumbling through an impromptu prayer</i><br>
<i>&gt; because the order of prayer is always predetermined.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
the words would be too, making it rather formalistic, and dry. Definitively<br>
not the fresh running waters from the fountain of God's spirit.<br>
<p>
Tell me how much space do they make for the Spirit to guide and work ?<br>
Or is the whole thing so manufactured and predetermined 100s of years<br>
in advance that the H.S. is left no space to work nor direct.<br>
Save us from formalism !<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4)  On the con side, singing the same liturgy every week would get slightly</i><br>
<i>&gt; boring.  But you do have to be on your toes to follow it all at first.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There's no sitting back and sleeping for 40 minutes, participation is </i><br>
<i>&gt; required every step of the way except during the 10-15 minute sermon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
even participation gets boring when it is ritualistic, and by defn. <br>
meaningless.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So how did the SDA form of worship become mostly like the Baptist liturgy?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Baptists weren't prominent in the early SDA church, were they?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Both denominations are so-called "spiritual experience" denominations</i><br>
<i>&gt; which place large emphasis on preaching as opposed to corporate worship</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and expect their ministers to uphold high moral standard).  That's</i><br>
<i>&gt; all I can think.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is the SDA church service today more devoted to conveying information</i><br>
<i>&gt; or to worship of God?  Are these mutually exclusive?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Is the RCC service more devoted to pomp and ritual works on an impersonal<br>
level than to seeking personal edification and conviction of sin through the <br>
direct promptings of God's Spirit ? <br>
<p>
<p>
It is interesting to observe the anti-typical appeal of the worship practices <br>
of the Midianites at Baal-peor for the Israelites. hmm, very interesting !<br>

[Original question]<br>
2) If god is so just, good, and loving, and if god wants to save us so bad, <br>
   why doesn't he show himself to all the people in the world at once?<br>
   That's the sure way to get everybody converted.<br>
<p>
[First response]<br>
Yea this is called Satans impersonation of Christ, and boy won't<br>
the whole world be converted. !<br>
<p>
[Tony's response to first response]<br>
So why doesn't God get in first? Not that I have an answer, but I think the<br>
original question is a fair one.<br>
<p>
--------------------------------<br>
I was not planning to reply to any of these questions.  I think<br>
that with one or two exceptions, they do not even make good<br>
conversation starters, let alone merit considered answers.  However,<br>
Tony thinks that this is a "fair one," so here is my $0.02.<br>
<p>
I find no better answer to "Why did God do that?" type questions<br>
than that given by the apostle Paul in the ninth chapter of Romans.<br>
<p>
   19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault?<br>
   For who withstandeth his will?<br>
   20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?<br>
<p>
But for Tony (and other believers) I have another answer.  God has<br>
shown himself to all the people in the world at once.  Not only<br>
that, but at that time, all the people in the world were not<br>
tainted by sin!  Yet, Mr. and Mrs. Adam rebelled against a revealed,<br>
trice-holy God.  Their "conversion" was not the result of their<br>
experience of seeing God, but due to the mercy and grace of God.<br>
<p>
One more thought just came to me.  Jesus said in John 14:9,<br>
<p>
   He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.<br>
<p>
The word of God, sharper than any two-edged sword, has the power,<br>
by the working of the Holy Ghost, to reveal Jesus to man.<br>
<p>

Reuben,<br>
<p>
It's true that Jesus didn't put on one act plays for the people or found <br>
a touring acting troupe, but He did use things that people could see <br>
right in front of them as examples...read the sermon on the mount.  "look <br>
at the lillies of the field.." etc.<br>

In Ruben's post he complains that a liturgical service would be too<br>
formal and ritualistic.  While I do agree with this, I remind you that <br>
SDA churches in general are obsessed with ritual.  If you have any doubt<br>
of this, watch the deaconesses argue about the right way to unfold the <br>
communion cloth and fold it again.  In debates about the style of worship,<br>
both sides are adamant that it really matters in what way one worships God.<br>
Even the so-called "Celebration churches" have a very set ritual.  The music<br>
is newer, people may be happier, but it is ritual nevertheless.  The good<br>
ones operate to a TV schedule, even.  And perhaps the ritual, shorn of <br>
most of the trappings, has less intrinsic meaning and symbolism than <br>
the older ones.<br>
<p>
What does the SDA church have today to offer a visual learner, or a<br>
kinesthetic learner?  For years the church service has been something to <br>
hear, and not something to see.  Does this work differently among <br>
SDA churches in illiterate peoples?  (Or are there such:  Do we require<br>
that someone learn to read the Bible before we even baptize him/her?)<br>
<p>
I anticipate that fifty years from now in the nursing home, the pastor<br>
of our "celebration church wanna-be" in Pittsburgh will still be requesting<br>
the same popcorn choruses he is singing now.  "Let's sing that great old<br>
hymn "Majesty"".  And other people in that same church will still be saying<br>
that he never should have taken the wooden railing off the choir loft<br>
and removed the big pulpit, let alone greet others in the sanctuary (GASP!).<br>

I want to check my understanding of SDA theology on this one:<br>
<p>
The standard view of liturgical churches is that there are seven<br>
sacraments, which are the means of conveying God's grace to the members<br>
of the church.<br>
These are baptism, confirmation, marriage, confession, ordination, last<br>
rites, (and what's the other one...burial?) (or else communion)<br>
<p>
If I understand the SDA view correctly, we hold that there are no sacraments.<br>
We perform baptism but this is only a sign of the person's previous<br>
commitment to God and does not convey any magical graces to the person.<br>
Ordination is a recognition that God has called a person to the gospel <br>
ministry.  The place or form of a persons burial has no effect on his/her<br>
salvation, it's too late for that.  <br>
<p>
The one I am not sure of is ordination, which involves the laying on of <br>
hands.  This follows the Biblical formula of laying on of hands and praying.<br>
Is it in this act that a special portion of the Holy Spirit is to come <br>
on those who are ordained?  Acts 6 doesn't indicate one way or the other.<br>
<p>
In general I appreciate the idea of a God who is not a trained poodle<br>
and has to jump around with every ringing bell.  But I wonder if I <br>
might be missing something in my understanding of the sacraments.<br>

A little correction Steve.  Not all liturgical Churches hold to seven<br>
sacrements.  The Catholic Church does.  They are Baptism, Penance, Holy<br>
Eucharist, Confirmation, HOly Matrimony, Holy Orders, and Last Rites.<br>
<p>
Most Protestant Churches hold to only two:  Baptism and the Lord's<br>
Supper.  These are kept because they had been originally instituted by<br>
Christ.  The others, although they have their sacredness, were not<br>
instituted by Christ.<br>
<p>
Matrimony, or marraige, was actually instituted before the Fall.  In the<br>
RP Church, this is what is referred to as a "creation ordinance".  It is<br>
binding on all creation, not just the people of God.  The Sabbath is<br>
another creation ordinance.  <br>

Rick suggests that "homosexual" is one label that can easily be applied.<br>
It is indeed one of the most frequently applied labels in the habit<br>
of people to try to separate "us" from "them."  It is still one of the <br>
most persistent labels in a church and society that has given labels <br>
to many.<br>
<p>
The church tends to view sins that disrupt the traditional family cycle<br>
as the most severe.  Even heterosexual singles are looked upon with suspicion<br>
sometimes.  But divorced people and single parents also know what it is <br>
to be labeled, and sometimes sexually harassed, by members in their church.<br>
The situations of these people draw attention because they are obvious, <br>
and also frequently irreversible.  She who has a child out of wedlock has<br>
the child to follow her around for the rest of her life, as a continual<br>
reminder of the mistake.  <br>
<p>
Some would say that the church ought to pay more attention to these types<br>
of behavior because they are obvious and show flaws in what should be the <br>
loving families of the church.  In some cases, such as 1 Corinthians 5,<br>
there is biblical support for this, but this case involved someone who<br>
would not repent after the best rehabilitative efforts of the church.<br>
If there is not much likelihood that other people will repeat the mistake,<br>
then it does not pose a risk to the community and doesn't need to be <br>
met with either labelling or banishment.<br>
<p>
Besides, in 20 years, homosexuality will be as accepted in the church<br>
as divorce is today.  Look at the trends.  Every generation allows<br>
what their parents forbid, then proceeds to draw new lines which they<br>
defend furiously.  You can be sure that all necrophiliacs and<br>
sadomasochists will be rooted out of the church of 20 years from now,<br>
just like homosexuals are today.<br>

Since there has been discussion concerning the Episcopalian Church and<br>
the Catholic Church, I figured I could shed some unique insights, since<br>
I have been involved in both, as well as everywhere else in between.<br>
<p>
I was raised in the Roman Church.  Early in my schooling years, we went<br>
from the Latin mass to English.  I also served as an altar boy.  When<br>
our Church merged with another parish, and they tore down my old church<br>
building, I was able to obtain as souvenoirs one of the candlesticks,<br>
and the "Sacrementary", the book used by the priest to say mass from. <br>
My particular copy has both the English and the Latin Order of Mass, as<br>
well as for the various prayers.<br>
<p>
At age seventeen, I came to know Christ, and wound up worshipping in a<br>
Pentecostal Church while I finished HIgh School.  <br>
<p>
After I started college, I began to attend an Episcopalian Church.  I<br>
worshipped there for nearly four years, and even taught Sunday School. <br>
I quit going there, and resigned my position as Sunday School teacher,<br>
when I found out that the priest and the Director of Christian Education<br>
were both Universalists.  Their belief was that all people are going to<br>
heaven because Christ died for all men.  This was true whether you<br>
accepted Him or not.  Hell did not exist.<br>
<p>
I have found the Episcopalian Church to be quite an adventure.  Many<br>
denominations can be stereotyped.  I have heard it say that if you are<br>
away from ;home, and know nothing about the Churches in an area, it is<br>
safe to go to a Baptist Church, for you will always have the basics of<br>
the Gospel preached.  But the Episcopalian Church is quite different. <br>
They cover the whole spectrum.  Right here in Pittsburgh, you have an<br>
Episcopalian Church that has the Universalist as the pastor, another one<br>
which is headed by an openly homosexual priest, and then one that is<br>
truly Evangelical and true to the Scriptures, and many of the local<br>
college students who live committed to Christ attend.  All three of<br>
these Churches are within ten minutes of each other.<br>
<p>
I really liked the episcopalian Church I attended for so long.  But if<br>
there ever could be a mishap in a worship service, it would happen<br>
there.  Like when they caught the Advent Wreath on fire.  Or when the<br>
person swinging the incense burner clonked it into the Baptismal font. <br>
Or when the rope broke on the bell in the tower.  ETc.  But I digress.<br>
<p>
One striking difference between the Catholic Church and the Episcopalian<br>
Church is the focus of the mass.  Although much of the ceremony, ritual,<br>
and liturgy is similar, the Catholic mass is offered FOR THE DEAD.  The<br>
Catholic mass is a sacrifice so that the sins of those that have died<br>
can be forgiven.  The lEpiscopalian Church teaches no such thing.  The<br>
Episcopalian Church does not teach a Purgatory.  There are no<br>
indulgences to be earned in the Episcopalian Church.  <br>
<p>
I think that is even more significant difference than who is the head of<br>
the particular church.  <br>

<i>&gt;&gt; What does the SDA church have today to offer a visual learner, or a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; kinesthetic learner?  For years the church service has been something to </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;NLP here we come ! doesn't the bible say that faith comes through</i><br>
<i>&gt;hearing of the word? For some reason I just can not picture Jesus, together</i><br>
<i>&gt;with Peter James and John acting out a little skit to illustrate a point</i><br>
<i>&gt;can you ?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ruben.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
This is rich.  I will just give some of the references I can find to <br>
Jesus teaching visually.<br>
Matthew 6:26,28<br>
Matthew 18:2-6<br>
Matthew 21:19-20<br>
Matthew 22:19<br>
Matthew 24:2<br>
Luke 7:44<br>
Luke 9:47<br>
Luke 21:1,2<br>
Luke 24:39<br>
John 8:6<br>
John 20:27<br>
<p>
In all these texts Jesus points to a visual example.  While I must admit<br>
Peter, James, and John never acted out a skit, there were powerful <br>
visual object lessons to be had.  And this doesn't even count the parables<br>
which were probably told based on things familiar and nearby,<br>
visible at the time to the disciples.  (I will check Christ's Object<br>
Lessons tonight).<br>
<p>
When was the last time you employed your sense of smell during <br>
a worship service (to good and edifying effect?)  What of touch?<br>
Does or should taste have a larger purpose than once a quarter during <br>
communion (ditto touch?)<br>

<i>&gt; Is it possible to have God's Spirit in different amounts?</i><br>
<p>
I could be disproved, but the references in Scripture to early vs latter<br>
rain tell me that this is true.  Actual refs: Deu 11:14, Jer 5:24;<br>
spiritual refs: Joel 2:23, Zec 10:1.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Can one pray for more of the Holy Spirit? Should one pray for more of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Holy Spirit?</i><br>
<p>
Based upon Zec 10:1, I say yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What does it mean that God gave Jesus the Spirit without measure?</i><br>
<p>
Limitations are never on His account (Hos 6:3), just ours (our unbelief)<br>
(cf Mark 9:23,24; Matt 19:26/Mar 10:27/Luke 18:27).  When we confess<br>
our unbelief and surrender everything we've been holding back, then we<br>
can experience what Jesus experienced throughout His life.<br>
<p>
Note that grace is the working of the Holy Spirit in our lives, giving us<br>
the desire *and* the power, both, to live in God's will, to live in ways<br>
that honor, please, and glorify God (Eph 1, Phil 2:12,13).  (Further reading,<br>
e.g., Christ's Object Lessons chapter re leavening the dough lump.)<br>

<p>
True.  But only by preaching?  Evidently predominantly so (1 Cor 1:21,<br>
Tit 1:3, Rom 10:14,15, 2 Tim 4:2).  But exclusively?  Let's look.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For some reason I just can not picture Jesus, together</i><br>
<i>&gt; with Peter James and John acting out a little skit to illustrate a point</i><br>
<i>&gt; can you ?</i><br>
<p>
While the extreme rarity of acted-out drama in Scripture should suggest<br>
something to us as to how frequently to use it, there is, however, some<br>
definite use.  Beyond Steve's observations re illustrations Jesus used,<br>
consider the object lessons of:<br>
* Hosea's marrying the wayward prostitute Gomer (talk about drama in<br>
  real life!).<br>
* Jeremiah's underclothing (Jer 13, altho this appears to have been done in<br>
  private); Jeremiah's singleness (Jer 16); the potter's vessel (Jer 18);<br>
  the bonds and yokes (Jer 27, 28); the purchase of real estate (Jer 32);<br>
  the Rechabites and wine (Jer 35); stones in clay (Jer 43).<br>
<p>
It is worthy of observation that, on balance, Jeremiah did far more preaching;<br>
moreover, his dramas were simple, not great productions.  I am not aware of<br>
any public dramas in NT times (Agabus incident, Act 21, was rather private).<br>
There is the frequent use of metaphors, imagery in visions, etc, but this is<br>
distinct from theatrical drama.<br>

[From Drew Corrigan]<br>
<p>
This is peripheral to the question Steve Timm raised, but it is something I<br>
have been pondering over lately.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The one I am not sure of is ordination, which involves the laying on of </i><br>
<i>&gt; hands.  This follows the Biblical formula of laying on of hands and praying.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is it in this act that a special portion of the Holy Spirit is to come </i><br>
<i>&gt; on those who are ordained?  Acts 6 doesn't indicate one way or the other.</i><br>
<p>
Is it possible to have God's Spirit in different amounts?<br>
<p>
Can one pray for more of the Holy Spirit? Should one pray for more of the <br>
Holy Spirit?<br>
<p>
What does it mean that God gave Jesus the Spirit without measure?<br>
<p>
Biblical support for any possible answers would be appreciated.<br>
<p>
Pondering,<br>

As I have understood it, the traditional broad-spectrum Protestant<br>
belief was that there were only two sacraments that had any Scriptural<br>
basis and should be retained: baptism and communion.  Not that the two<br>
weren't altered to fit -- communion in the Protestant camp deliberately<br>
undercut the notion of transubstantiation (which is another word for<br>
"Trust me, even though these look and smell and feel and taste like<br>
bread and wine they're really really really the flesh and blood of<br>
Jesus.  Work with me on this one."<br>
<p>
So ordination in the Protestant view isn't exactly a sacrament.  In<br>
fact, Luther's writings contain the germ of the notion of "vocation" or<br>
calling -- the sense that one is doing precisely what God meant you to<br>
do (whether God meant for you to do this even before you were born<br>
depends on how you feel about predestination...but I digress).  My twin<br>
brother, on the other hand, claims that employment is based more on<br>
economic necessity on the part of the employer than on anything so<br>
mystical as a calling.  The fact that he's currently putting his<br>
Master's degree in Communication to use working in the word processing<br>
pool of an insurance company in Chicago may have something to do with<br>
it.  And it only just recently occurred to me where I'd heard that line<br>
of reasoning before: "Indeed, does Job serve you for nothing?..."<br>

Steves comments on cognitive dissonance were quite pertinent. In spite<br>
of the protests of evangelists and theologians, people join the church<br>
because that is where their friends are. It takes more than church<br>
authority, doctrinal purity, moral rectitude and logic to convince<br>
people that the church is the right place to be. Human relationships<br>
are probably the most important single factor in influencing a person<br>
to join or stay with the church.<br>
<p>
The Bible emphasises this with statements like:<br>
<p>
"By this shall all men know you are my disciples, if you love one<br>
another.."<br>
<p>
"Ye are the salt of the earth..", etc<br>
<p>
Jesus ministry is most compelling when he is ministering at a personal<br>
level. eg The woman at the well, His conversations with Peter, His<br>
discussions with rabbis at night, His willingness to eat with tax<br>
collectors, His affirming the value of people who were prostitutes,<br>
publicans and sinners.<br>
<p>
Our church often has greater concern for doctrinal purity, Greek textual<br>
backgrounds, orders of service. I do not deny the necessity for these things,<br>
but I think that we must relate to real people.<br>
<p>
I think our attitudes are expressed in the sort of training we give to<br>
our ministers. More time is given to studying doctrine and academic theology<br>
while less time is spent on social issues. A minister in our society<br>
probably spends more time as a social worker than as a preacher, just as<br>
in Christ's own ministry. We owe it to them to prepare them thoroughly for<br>
this type of work.<br>
<p>
For the rest of us, computer scientists, physicists, accountants etc. we<br>
must live our Christianity by seeking opportunities to love those who<br>
need our love, both in and out of the church. The judgement scenes depicted<br>
in the parable of the sheep and the goats shows no commendation for<br>
doctrinal purity, knowledge of the 27 fundamentals, or the ability to recite<br>
proof texts. Cups of cold water, visting the sick, and imprisoned are<br>
given rich reward. To accept Jesus as saviour carries with it<br>
the responsibility of sharing love with people in need.<br>

<i>&gt;    the sure way to get everybody converted.</i><br>
&lt;---<br>
<p>
God send his son down and he spent over 20 years talking about God and<br>
performing miracles, yet there were many that were not converted.  The simple<br>
reason that God does not just appear to everyone at once is that most would<br>
still not believe.<br>

<i>&gt; In all these texts Jesus points to a visual example.  While I must admit</i><br>
<i>&gt; Peter, James, and John never acted out a skit, there were powerful </i><br>
<i>&gt; visual object lessons to be had.  And this doesn't even count the parables</i><br>
<i>&gt; which were probably told based on things familiar and nearby,</i><br>
<i>&gt; visible at the time to the disciples.  (I will check Christ's Object</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lessons tonight).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but he...wait for it....talks about it for others to listen.<br>
Its still talking about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When was the last time you employed your sense of smell during </i><br>
<i>&gt; a worship service (to good and edifying effect?)  What of touch?</i><br>
<p>
Smell ??:^!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does or should taste have a larger purpose than once a quarter during </i><br>
<i>&gt; communion (ditto touch?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Ahh, not even that at my church, the grape juice is watered down and the <br>
bread is also generally insipid.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I hope that your USENET ministry works out well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think that the church is better in some places than others.  It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; not all as bad as what you experienced.  We had an experience where</i><br>
<i>&gt; our pastor got out of line and the conference president came down</i><br>
<i>&gt; to explain to the congregation what had happened and how the pastor</i><br>
<i>&gt; had erred.  I was grateful for that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I don't even require that.  There is no need to embarrass a pastor before<br>
his congregation.  But to totally ignore a matter, to not even acknowledge<br>
receipt is abrogation of responsibility.  Sometimes it is better to deal<br>
with the pastor and have him talk to the church about it.  It happened to<br>
me once.  In one of my sermons I made an innocent remark about a political<br>
figure the congregation supported.  Someone spoke to the president.  He<br>
knew me well, he had baptized me and called me to the ministry, and called<br>
me into his office.  After we had discussed it he understood the<br>
misunderstanding.  I  could have left it there.  The next time I preached<br>
at that church, I spoke to them first at their level.  (I long ago pledged<br>
to only deal with the word from the pulpit).  I told them I was sorry for<br>
the misunderstanding and explained what my remark had meant.  Doing that<br>
did not diminish me in any way. In fact I believe they respected me more<br>
as a result.  I would not have liked it if the president had paid a visit<br>
to the district.<br>

<i>&gt;Woody says:</i><br>
<i>&gt;    You only have to look to China (remember Beijing?), Russia,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hitlers Germany, the 1200's etc to realize that an unarmed citizenry</i><br>
<i>&gt;has no freedom or control over it's destiny.  It is at the mercy of</i><br>

<i>&gt;prevent that kind of abuse.  The armed free man is and always has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been the only guarantee of freedom, and the only thing standing in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the way of tyranny.......</i><br>
<p>
Now Woody:<br>
Guns being a more recent invention (a few hundred years)..  What kind<br>
of gun are you talking about?  The weapons technology is proceeding<br>
along, so in a few more years, we should all have laser guns, and<br>
maybe a little guided missile, or maybe a small pocket-sized tactical<br>
nuclear weapon.  Do you know why?  We have to protect ourselves from<br>
these sinister governments.  Ha! Ha! Ha!<br>

Some have regretted starting the discussion on homosexuality.  But look<br>
at the big picture.  In SDAnet we were able to discuss it without resorting<br>
to profanity, name-calling, or ad hominem attacks.  You should see what <br>
happens on the big net (where, incidentally, several articles have appeared<br>
recently on what Paul did mean by the Greek term "Arsenokoitai",<br>
found only in that place in the Bible (Romans 1).)<br>
<p>
If anyone is ready to tackle the big issues and put out a post which does <br>
not claim to be the word of the Lord, by all means continue.<br>

<i>&gt; to profanity, name-calling, or ad hominem attacks.  You should see what </i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
I can't understand why there such a upshot over homosexuality.  If we were<br>
really concerned with sin I would understand.  But we encourage pride,<br>
excuse embezzlement.  We cannot be selective.  Do you for one moment think<br>
that a sermon on adultery breaks up the deacon's wife from the church<br>
elder?  I know that is simplistic and not quite complete.<br>
<p>
We cannot be true to scripture and accept homosexual behavior as<br>
appropriate.  Where I have difficulty is with those who argue against born<br>
homosexuals.  In my mind if sin has marred the creation it is only to be<br>
expected that it messed up the genes of some people.  When I pastored I<br>
had a few rumored homosexuals in my congregation.  I left it alone.  In my<br>
view just saying that something is fine does not make it fine in God's<br>
sight.  We have to ask God for guidance each day.  Sometimes He asks us to<br>
stop doing even things which are good.  Someone who earnestly seeks God's<br>
will will always have his prayer answered.  Why it should it be more<br>
sinful to keep on being homosexual (in behavior) than in refusing to give<br>
up pride.  The truth is only God knows who he is going to take into His<br>
heaven.  I cannot take you in by accepting your behavior or keep you out<br>
by rejecting it.  After all if you are faking God knows.  Our cleverness<br>
of argument does not impress Him at all.<br>
<p>
Intellectual debate is fine, but unless we are working towards towards<br>
building faith.  It is faith Jesus was concerned about finding on earth. <br>
People who only comply to church edits have not built faith.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Woody says:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;    You only have to look to China (remember Beijing?), Russia,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Hitlers Germany, the 1200's etc to realize that an unarmed citizenry</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;has no freedom or control over it's destiny.  It is at the mercy of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the government.  The right to bear arms was specificaly included to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;prevent that kind of abuse.  The armed free man is and always has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;been the only guarantee of freedom, and the only thing standing in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the way of tyranny.......</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now Woody:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Guns being a more recent invention (a few hundred years)..  What kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; of gun are you talking about?  The weapons technology is proceeding</i><br>
<i>&gt; along, so in a few more years, we should all have laser guns, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; maybe a little guided missile, or maybe a small pocket-sized tactical</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuclear weapon. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you know why?  We have to protect ourselves from</i><br>
<i>&gt; these sinister governments.  Ha! Ha! Ha!</i><br>
<p>
There is entirely too much trust of governments among SDAs.  Its been<br>
fortold that the U.S. would speak like a dragon.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Len</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [Len, if you were in Texas any period of time, you would realize that</i><br>
<i>&gt; David Koresh was but one of many who subscribed exactly to the philosophy</i><br>
<i>&gt; above, and thought it to be no laughing matter.  SCT]</i><br>
<p>
No, its not a laughing matter.<br>
<p>
So far I've stayed out of this gun ownership debate, but now I'm going<br>
to spring in because I believe that SDA's should be aware of the end-time<br>
significance of what's going on.  No, I don't mean that Koresh was the<br>
antichrist or similar silliness, I just mean that the U.S. government<br>
is drifting in a most disturbing direction and it is not hard to see <br>
how Sunday Law legislation could be inflicted soon.<br>
<p>
I'll start with some radical statements and then back them up with facts. <br>
<p>
Radical statement:  <br>
<p>
Americans need guns to protect themselves against their own government.  <br>
<p>
Facts:  <br>
<p>
1.  The people who wrote the constitution recognized this.  That is why it <br>
    was written into the constitution.<br>
<p>
    Thomas Jefferson was the one who said that the right to keep and bear<br>
    arms was for the citizens to protect themselves from the government.<br>
<p>
2.  Everybody heard about the Weaver trial going on right now?<br>
    Basically Randy Weaver is on trial for murder.  Federal Agents came on<br>
    his land and killed his whole family.  They shot first--he shot back<br>
    to try and defend himself and his kids.  Is he getting a fair trial?<br>
<p>
    You be the judge, read the following:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;forwarded from firearms-politics@cs.cmu.edu -- Bob Leone</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television</i><br>
<i>&gt;station, KTVB Channel 7.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Tuesday, May 25, 1993 was the twenty-sixth day of the trial.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Synopsis: The prosecution today admitted that many of the photographs</i><br>
<i>&gt; submitted as evidence were fabricated.  U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen</i><br>
<i>&gt; assumed blame for the photographs.  Remarkably, U.S. District Judge</i><br>
<i>&gt; Edward Lodge declined a defense request to inform the jury about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; recent string of evidence problems.</i><br>
<p>
(I'll cut it off here--anybody who wants the full story just email<br>
 me and I'll send it too you.)<br>
<p>
We all would be well advised to consider the kind of government we have.<br>
It kills people, and then fakes evidence to cover its tracks.  Moreover,<br>
not even the courts will allow the jurors to hear all the facts of the<br>
case.<br>
<p>
Such a government will not hesitate to impose a Sunday law as soon as<br>
the angels stop holding back the winds of strife!<br>
<p>
Yes, evil people can commit all kinds of mayhem with weapons.  But you<br>
don't seriously think that the government is composed of all angels do<br>
you?  Why should they get all the guns?<br>

I would add that if Len had been alive in the 1700's here in America, he<br>
would have a diffrent outlook.  I can't understand how people can be so<br>
blind.  History is just loaded with example after example of atrocities<br>
imposed on unarmed citizens by an armed government.  The people who fought<br>
for the US's independence, and framed the constitution understood this all<br>
to well.  It should be remembered that the Muzzle loading musket was the<br>
"assult weapon" of the times.  Yes, technology does advance.  But the government<br>
always makes sure it stays out of the hands of the people, lest they be<br>
able to overthrow it.  I truely believe that if the framers of the constituion<br>
had been able to conceputlize a fully automatic weapon, and had been able to <br>
forsee what our government would ultimatly do, they would have worded the<br>
amendment slightly diffrently.  Such as: ....to bear arms OF ANY TYPE OR<br>
CLASSIFICATION shall not be infringed...<br>

Steve, I was just trying some dry sarcasm when I replied to Woody:<br>
<p>
*********************************************************************<br>
Now Woody:<br>
Guns being a more recent invention (a few hundred years)..  What kind<br>
of gun are you talking about?  The weapons technology is proceeding<br>
along, so in a few more years, we should all have laser guns, and<br>
maybe a little guided missile, or maybe a small pocket-sized tactical<br>
nuclear weapon.  Do you know why?  We have to protect ourselves from<br>
these sinister governments.  Ha! Ha! Ha!<br>
<p>
Len<br>
<p>
You replied:<br>
<p>
[Len, if you were in Texas any period of time, you would realize that<br>
David Koresh was but one of many who subscribed exactly to the philosophy<br>
above, and thought it to be no laughing matter.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<p>
Now Steve, I followed the Koresh affair closely.  I do not subcribe to<br>
the suggestions above.  However, Woody seems to believe that we<br>
should all be armed to protect ourselves from tyrannical governments.<br>
 My point is that if we continue this argument to its logical<br>
conclusion, there may be no end to the degree to which destroy<br>
ourselves with all these weapons we have around us - all in the name<br>
of " the constitutional right to bear arms".<br>
<p>
Let us rather be armed with the "sword of the spirit", because "he<br>
will give his angels charge over" us.<br>
<p>
That's all folk!<br>
Len<br>

For those who might be interested.<br>
<p>
The SDA gay youth who's family disowned him, has been placed<br>
with a supportive family, by "non" - Christian professionals.<br>
<p>
Upon visiting the center, I recognized pamphlets and brochures<br>
from various religious groups and denominations which offer non<br>
judgmental spiritual support.  I'd like to get some SDA inforamtion in the<br>
youth center, just in case more of our young people find themselves<br>
there.  If anyone has knowledge of information, please let me know.<br>

Plays work quite well at summer camp, academy and college services,<br>
and even in the my local church here in Seattle.<br>
<p>
Just because Jesus reaps where He has not sown, or gathers where He hasn't<br>
scattered, is no cause for us to sit on the talents the He has given <br>
us.  I believe<br>
we are to not only go into all the world, but to fulfill the world of <br>
communicative<br>
possibilities Christ, through science and education have informed us about.<br>
<p>
Has God given us knowledge of learning styles, and temperaments so that we<br>
ignore them for the sake of "traditional" approaches (vis-a-vis)?  <br>
Let's get wisdom,<br>
knowledge &amp; understanding... and make it practical in reaching people - <br>
ALL people.<br>

Strangely, I'm excited that there was a discussion about homosexuality.<br>
It is a subject that few have dared discuss openly, without "fear of<br>
association", and traditional angry argument.<br>
<p>
SDAnet shows that it is a place where even controversial issues can be<br>
discussed openly, and that faith in the character and principles of Jesus<br>
Christ are strong enough to withstand controversy.  We still haven't<br>
discussed the practical applications of dealing with homosexual people<br>
or Christians, and Seventh-day Adventist homosexuals in particular.<br>
<p>
If this happens or not, I hope that we (including myself) are at the <br>
first step<br>
in realizing that everything is not as cut and dried as purported, and that<br>
there are big issues which need to be discussed.<br>

Dan quotes<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault?</i><br>
<i>&gt;   For who withstandeth his will?</i><br>
<i>&gt;   20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?</i><br>
<p>
and then writes<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;But for Tony (and other believers) I have another answer.  God has</i><br>
<i>&gt;shown himself to all the people in the world at once.  Not only</i><br>
<i>&gt;that, but at that time, all the people in the world were not</i><br>
<i>&gt;tainted by sin!  Yet, Mr. and Mrs. Adam rebelled against a revealed,</i><br>
<i>&gt;trice-holy God.  Their "conversion" was not the result of their</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience of seeing God, but due to the mercy and grace of God.</i><br>
<p>
Good points all, Dan. I think though that there is a difference between<br>
Adam &amp; Eve's situation and ours today. They didn't realize, but their<br>
situation could only get worse. Ours has a lot of room for improvement!<br>
Eve was deceived into thinking she was choosing a better option, just<br>
like people will be once again in the scenario Ruben mentioned.<br>
<p>
Having thought about the question "why doesn't God just show himself<br>
etc. etc.", I would agree with whoever said that people wouldn't believe<br>
him anyway. What would it take to convince a 20th century man that you<br>
were God? And even then, those who did believe would probably do so<br>
for the wrong reasons, like Judas apparently did.<br>

It sounds, Ruben, as though you would be happy with a narrated mime or<br>
skit, but not with other forms of drama.<br>
<p>
What I must admit I fail to understand, is why this problem is even a problem.<br>
<p>
Surely it is obvious to any communicating person that people have different<br>
ways of listening and learning. The division into auditory, visual and<br>
kinesthetic is just an arbitrary classification scheme that can help in<br>
understanding some of the different ways people "listen". Even within a narrow<br>
field of learning this is the case. Some physicists use diagrams for <br>
everything, others prefer equations. When studying for exams, some people<br>
remember the sound of a formula by reciting it to themselves, others remember<br>
how to write it down or what it looks like.<br>
<p>
So why not take these differences into account when communicating with<br>
people? Teachers certainly should. Why not preachers? It's not a case of<br>
NLP, hypnosis or mind control, just simple communication skills.<br>
<p>
By the way, how about all the prophets who were given visions, rather than<br>
hearing the voice of God? Some of them actually experienced physical<br>
sensations as well. You can't tell me that the scene with Isaiah and the<br>
burning coal wasn't some kind of dramatic presentation for his benefit!<br>
What about Jeremiah lying on his side for weeks on end, or Hosea's struggles<br>
with his wife? The allegorical form of communication has a long and<br>
distinguished history!<br>

My question is simple and comes out of a personal experience.  Our purpose for<br>
existence id to witness to God's love in the hope of repentance and<br>
salvation.  If you know of someone who has had a sex change operation what<br>
should be your attitude towards witnessing to that person?  Should such a<br>
person be invited to church, or given bible studies, or exposed to the<br>
truths about Jesus?<br>

<i>&gt; It's true that Jesus didn't put on one act plays for the people or found </i><br>

Yes I accept that, but I consider that type of thing as different from<br>
what many often mean when they talk about visually communicating.<br>

		       What's a trick question?<br>
<p>
A recent message mentioned a survey taken in the Far Eastern Division<br>
in which the youth were asked a question like ``Do you have to live a<br>
good life in order to be accepted by God?''  A large majority said<br>
yes.  This was interpreted as evidence that the youth do not<br>
understand righteousness by faith.  I have some problems with this<br>
interpretation.  It is true that we do not earn salvation by our works<br>
and that we are justified by faith.  However, that is not exactly what<br>
the question said.  We will be judged on the basis of our works, as<br>
the Scriptures make abundantly clear.  These works are the fruit of<br>
faith working by love.  But if the works are not present then we do<br>
not have saving faith.  So in a sense it is true that we have to<br>
live a good life (as evidence of faith) in order to be accepted by<br>
God (on the judgment day).<br>
<p>
One might say that the Lord accepts us now because of the cross and<br>
all we have to do is accept the fact that He accepts us.  The Bible<br>
does say that we are ``accepted in the Beloved'' (Ephesians 1:6).<br>
However, if the Lord accepts us now regardless of our response, then<br>
why will He not accept us on the judgment day?  Why will He not accept<br>
us into heaven regardless of whether we accept Him, if He accepts us<br>
now regardless of whether we respond?  It seems to me that there is a<br>
valid sense in which one can say that the Lord does not really accept<br>
us now if we do not respond to Him in faith.  I would find it a<br>
strange kind of acceptance if the Lord fully accepted me all my life<br>
and then when judgment day comes I am rejected because I did not<br>
respond.  That would be like my boss being friendly to me every day<br>
and then suddenly firing me.<br>
<p>
So now I assume that the church leaders will take the responses to<br>
this questionnaire as evidence that the youth of the Far Eastern<br>
division do not understand righteousness by faith.  My impression is<br>
that the Far Eastern Division is probably a lot more alive than the<br>
North American Division where the answers to this question might be<br>
slightly more ``politically correct.''  Now the leaders will try to<br>
convince the youth that what you do isn't so important but who you<br>
believe.  Suppose instead that the leaders had asked the question,<br>
``Can you be saved if you continually and deliberately sin?''  Now,<br>
that may also be a trick question.  But I am sure that quite a number<br>
would reason, yes, we are all sinners, and we are saved by faith, so<br>
we can be saved if we continually sin.  But the leaders could say, the<br>
answer should be no, our faith should be revealed in a life of<br>
obedience and so we need to convince the youth of the importance of<br>
sanctification.  (Hebrews 10:26,27) I would not be completely happy<br>
with that decision, either.  I wonder if the kind of questions that<br>
are asked reveals more about the plans of the leadership than the<br>
responses do about the beliefs of the church members.<br>
<p>
My point is that you have to use more than a few responses to<br>
ambiguous questions in order to determine the state of one's<br>
spirituality or that of the youth of the church.<br>

. . .because I've wondered and taught about this in SS I once<br>
wrote a continuation of the life of the thief on the cross which<br>
assumed he lived after that awful and wonderful day.  What do<br>
you suppose his life would have been like had he lived, for he<br>
appears to have been a tad short on good works when he was promised<br>
everlasting life with Christ?<br>

I think the point is that if we really let God's Spirit speak<br>
to us then we won't need to rely instead on humanistic mechanisms.<br>
<p>
Our problem today is very simple, we need the latter rain, God wants<br>
to communicate to us directly through His Spirit and not through means<br>
of our own devising. But it seems that we always have some better solution<br>
than that which God has provided. He has been waiting a long time for<br>
us to realise our need of His Spirit and to seek Him earnestly. But no<br>
we have a better way that we feel more comfortable with, more in tune<br>
with our humanity.<br>
<p>
And now "Ask ye of the Lord rain in the days of the latter rain" Zech 10:1<br>
has become "let us go down to Egypt and learn psychology and such that _we_ may <br>
learn how to better communicate. God says "Not by might, nor by power but by <br>
my Spirit saith the Lord of Hosts."<br>
<p>
Instead of turning to man and the "arm of flesh" why is it we don't turn<br>
to God for the outpouring of His Spirit.<br>
<p>
Is it better plans, or more money or a better system of people control,<br>
better people, or more worship, better accountability, better equipment,<br>
or more diverse and contempory services that we need ? No, none of these.<br>
We need only one thing...God's Spirit, and until we turn away from all these<br>
other things (idols) that we put before God's Spirit and seek the outpouring<br>
of His Spirit among us we are wasting our time, and acting contrary to God's<br>
will.<br>

I read Beng's letter with some interest, there are some comments I would like <br>
to make, regarding some of what Beng said.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      The conservatives see the influence of the world infiltrating the</i><br>
<i>&gt; church, they see church standards and even basic bible doctrines being eroded</i><br>
<i>&gt; and being treated with less and less importance. They therefore place great</i><br>
<i>&gt; emphasis on behaviour and good works, church standards and correct doctrine,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and calling sin by its right name. They believe in salvation by grace through</i><br>
<i>&gt; faith, but are afraid to stress it lest it open the floodgates of iniquity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They fear that if people think that we are not saved by good works, they will</i><br>
<i>&gt; become lawless and decadent.</i><br>
<p>
I don't think conservatives have stopped stressing salvation by faith at all,<br>
that they consider santification an important aspect of salvation does<br>
not weaken their emphasis on justification, its just that the two go together<br>
or not at all. There is no continuing justification without an accompanying <br>
sanctification. I completely disagree that conservatives fear that without<br>
the people being deceived into believing salvation by works they will become<br>
lawless and decadent. If this is what you think conservatives are about<br>
then you are mistaken. This salvation by works issue is a staw man set up by<br>
some in order to get the unaffiliated on side. Was EGW a legalist ?<br>
did she want to deceive people into legalism ? Well the same applies<br>
to conservatives as applied to her. Of course I know some people will <br>
say that EGW was a legalist. But then that is only because we have a new <br>
definition of legalism. <br>
<p>
Legalism used to be defined as attempting to be saved by our own<br>
merits in doing works, nowdays legalism in some quaters has come to mean<br>
anybody who thinks works have any role in the Christian life. Well for those <br>
who think they don't, tell me one thing, how will you be judged ?<br>
<p>
Its especially true that any unbalanced understanding of the gospel leads <br>
to lawlessness and the salvation by works concept leads to just as much <br>
lawlessness as the anitnomian one.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;      The liberals, in part at least, are reacting to what they perceive as</i><br>
<i>&gt; the teaching of salvation by works, from the conservatives. They stress the</i><br>
<p>
<p>
A large component of the "confirmed" liberals  I know (note the qualification)<br>
are not reacting at all, rather they are pro-acting. (And I am not<br>
alluding to any SDAnet correspondents)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Perhaps that is over-simplifying it but i think that's roughly how it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is. I personally agree with both of these groups, but i feel that we need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get a balanced picture of what we believe, so that we don't confuse people.</i><br>
<p>
I wish it was so simple, but unfortunately it isn't.<br>
<p>
Thats exactly the problem, what do we believe ? what we used to believe<br>
or what we are now told we are supposed to believe ? There are two gospels<br>
in the church today, we are not talking two viewpoints, we are talking<br>
two separate and distinct gospels.<br>
<p>
Those who have really studied the issues on both sides of the fence will<br>
tell you that there can be no compromise between both sides. There are two<br>
paths, and they both lead in separate directions. Of course very few have<br>
actually done a profound study on both sides of the issues and so<br>
will not appreciate that even though some things sound similar they lead<br>
down completely different paths.<br>
<p>
Should we change the pillars of our faith to be more accomodating for those <br>
who don't believe ? If so then where do we draw the line ?<br>
<p>
<p>

As a lifelong flatlander, I've often wondered how I would get out to <br>
any sort of mountain when the persecution started.  Besides this, to track<br>
me down electronically would be trivial.  I suspect a hand will just come out<br>
of the terminal, slap on the handcuffs, and that will be it.<br>
<p>
Do those of you who say that guns are needed to protect us in America from <br>
our own government intend to take up arms whenever the death-decree folks<br>
come after you?  Do you think it will do any good to shoot a few of them?<br>
And if you don't think you would do it in the ultimate situation, why<br>
in any other situation?  <br>
<p>
As long as we have the constitution to protect us from our own government,<br>
we are fine.  If people ever mess with the constitution, they'll probably put<br>
in gun control, too, so guns would not be available to do the job the<br>
constitution could not.  I think that at the time of the end the only thing<br>
we will be able to trust to protect us from our government is the power<br>
of God,  and that is no less true now than it will be then.<br>
<p>
Of course, we could follow the example of the old Quaker farmer who said,<br>
"Friend, I mean thee no harm but thou standest where I am about to shoot."<br>
If I were to do that, I'd most probably shoot myself in the foot or something.<br>

Dear SDA Net:<br>
<p>
As a learning disabled student I have many times felt left out of church<br>
because of the lack of the ablility for the preacher to use the proper<br>
words and method of teaching that I learn in.  I am a very visual learner<br>
and learn the least through my ears.  I am easily distracted and when I<br>
was younger was hyperactive.  Now that I am in college sometimes my<br>
hyperactivity will sneek up on me, but I usaly can control it.  I am still<br>
learning disabled and get distracted a lot.  <br>
<p>
Then one Sabbath something new caught my eye.  Rather my brain, I suddenly<br>
realized that as I was learning sign language from Fred Christenson and<br>
others who I deeply miss, that I was understanding sermons for the first<br>
time in my life since I was able to fallow them the whole way through.  I<br>
learned that the sign will allow my mind to use sight as well as movement<br>
and space to learn.  Besides I am still using my ears.  You have no idea<br>
the joy I foudn in the Lord because of that.  Now that I go to church with<br>
out an interpriter, I often find myself falling asleep again and have no<br>
idea what is being said or how diffrent things relate.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying that every SDA should learn sign language (as much as I<br>
wish.... :)~  But I am saying that learning diffrences are not made up and<br>
people will learn only in the way their brain can function.  In Jesus day<br>
the comon people mostly spoke.  Lille did they write for pleasure becuase<br>
of how complex it was for writing and supplies.  The people were oral. <br>
Jesus used paribles then to paint a spoken mental picture or story of what<br>
he is trying to say and explain.  Now that people watch tv so much we are<br>
now a visual society.  We need the plays, skits, dramma, to tell us what<br>
used to be spoken to us.<br>
<p>
Us the tools God have given!  If you can teach more than one style than do<br>
it.  There is a phrase, "If 1/3 of your audience is youth then 1/3 of your<br>
sermon should be for them."  I say that holds true for others too.  <br>
(eg: use something physical you are holding such as a lemon to make a<br>
point, use body movments, use pictures, use music, use lighting, use more<br>
than one speaker, use diffrent communication skill of style of speaking. etc.)<br>

True, they could not compare the consequences of one course of decision<br>
from the other from an experiential standpoint.  It is worth noting, tho,<br>
that Patriarchs and Prophets makes it clear that Jesus and the angels spent<br>
much time telling Adam and Eve about Satan's rebellion and fall, about the<br>
consequences of following him, and that he would tempt them thru the tree<br>
of the knowledge of good and evil.  Everything that could righteously be<br>
done to forewarn and forearm them was done.<br>

David has raised some important issues in his response.  Leading questions<br>
on pyschological questionnaires are always a problem.  We should probably<br>
communicate our concerns to the appropriate leaders who will develop policy<br>
based upon the responses to the questionnaire.  Does anyone know who they<br>
might be?<br>

Unfortunatly the constitution DOES NOT protect us.  An no, I am not an avocate<br>
of taking up arms to defend against the death decree.  However, the mere presence<br>
of an armed citizenry is enough to hold abuses in check generaly.  Once again<br>
I want to state that the concept of the free-hold estate and the armed free<br>
man is central to the twarting of tyranny.  Unfortunatly, our courts have<br>
gutted or nearly gutted most provisions of the constitution governing freedoms.<br>
The free excercise clause is now gone. (Hopefully the Freedom of Restoration<br>
Act will make it through, and Clinton will sign it).  Free speech is severelyt<br>
curtailed, rights of choice in other matters are curtailed, and protection<br>
against unlawful search and seizure has been gutted as well.  We are rapidly<br>
spinning toward a police state.  Of course, most SDA's have expected that<br>
to happen for a very long time, but folks it IS happening.<br>
<p>
For our international members, the U.S. constituion guarantees the right<br>
to freedom of religion.  The constitution forbids the government from<br>
making any laws that  interfere or promote religion i.e. they have to be<br>
neutral, and further prevents it from interfering with the "free excercise"<br>
of religious beliefs.  Now, up until a couple of years ago, the government<br>
had to prove a "compelling state interest" in order to interfere with any<br>
religious practice whatsoever, be it putting a road through the Native<br>
American holy spots, etc. etc.  Justice Antone Scalia is a rabid anti-religious<br>
freedom oriented judge.  A couple of years ago, Smith vs Oregon was decided<br>
in favor of Oregon.  Apparently Mr. Smith had a drug conviction on other grou<br>
grounds, and as part of his sentence, was required to work in a drug rehab<br>
center.  He was a member of the Native American church, which uses the drug<br>
peote to induce "spiritual visions"  It is a powerful hallucinogen.  He was<br>
fired for this, and applied for unemplyment benefits.  The state of Oregon<br>
denied them.  The case got appealed to the supreme court, which threw out<br>
the "compelling state interest" test, and substitued "facially neutral" for<br>
the test.  That is, if the law is a "facially neutral" law not aimed at any<br>
PARTICULAR religion (note it MAY be construed to mean that a general law<br>
could be aimed at ALL religions), then that is all that is required for the<br>
government to interfere.  It does not take a rocket scientist to see that this<br>
lays open a wide potential for abuse.  There is a town in Florida, that in<br>
order to stop animal sacrifices going on in a particular religion, has out<br>
lawed all animal sacrifices.  One of the relgious leaders points out that<br>
you can "kill a turkey, cook it, say prayer over it and eat it", but under<br>
the new law, if you "say prayer over the turkey, then kill, cook and eat it<br>
you can go to jail".  The city claims that it is a "facially neutral law"<br>
not aimed at any particular religion, but is aimed at animal sacrifices<br>
specifically.  Of course, there are no known cases of animal sacrifices outside<br>
of that particular religion, but that makes no diffrence.  Using the<br>
"compelling state intrest" test, this law would be overthrown.  Using the<br>
"facially neutral" law, and the ultra conservative Bush/Reagan stuffed court<br>
it may well be upheld.  <br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Does this mean - Ruben - that I cannot be saved?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Ralf</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now Ralf, did I say anything even remotely like that ? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ruben.</i><br>
I do not save all the communication from SDAnet, but my interpretation<br>
about your points about NLP and "new psychology" if that you can<br>
only accept salvation that comes through means of the Holy Spirit<br>
and "hearing the word of God...". You will limit the tools God (and we)<br>
can use to those literally from the Bible - correct me if I am wrong.<br>
I have difficulties to grasp information given to me orally - of course<br>
I would need to train that more, but I have seldom the patience to listen<br>
people to the point, in a written document I can jump over all the <br>
"liturgy" and get straight to the conclusion.<br>

Re: witnessing<br>
<p>
I found these beautiful statements while reading through The Desire of Ages.<br>
They help me understand my role in witnessing, and might help others:<br>
<p>
Speaking about the woman healed when she touched Christ's garment in<br>
Chapter 36 (The Touch of Faith).<br>
<p>
"After healing the woman, Jesus desired her to acknowledge the blessing<br>
she had received.  The gifts which the gospel offers are not be secured<br>
by stealth or enjoyed in secret.  So the Lord calls upon us for confession<br>
of His goodness.  'Ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am <br>
God'."  Isa 43:12<br>
<p>
"Our confession of His faithfulness is Heaven's chosen agency for revealing<br>
Christ to the world.  We are to acknowledge His grace as made known through<br>
the holy men of old; **but that which will be most effective is the <br>
testimony of our<br>
own experience.**  We are witnesses for God as we reveal in ourselves the<br>
working of a power that is divine.  #Every individual has a life <br>
distinct from all others,<br>
and an experience differing essentially from theirs.  God desires that <br>
our praise<br>
shall ascend to Him, marked by our own individuality.#  These precious acknow-<br>
ledgments to the praise of the glory of His grace, when supported by a <br>
Christ-like<br>
life, have an irresistible power that works for the salvation of souls."<br>
<p>
There are more great gems in the next chapter, "The First Evangelists".<br>
This is more of a foundation to build on.  I believe God calls us to <br>
fulfill the image of<br>
Himself in us, by being creative as we build upon HIM.<br>
<p>
Marcus<br>

I'm shocked that you would even ask whether or not to invite such a <br>
person to church. God doesn't look at what sex we are, or what body <br>
parts we currently have. God looks at the heart and character of the <br>
individual. Our character is a reflection of God not our sex. Persons <br>
who have undergone sex changes are as much a child of God as anyone <br>
else. God Grace is sufficient for everyone and anyone.<br>

Looks like my mailer is acting up again.  I copied the last message to<br>
myself and it appears in my mailbox complete with my post.  Fortunately I<br>
had saved the message in my home directory also.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Darius,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you replied to a message but only included Marcus Stringer's text</i><br>
<i>&gt; and didn't say anything new.  Did you send too fast, or something?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I notice that the posts you send me have the original poster's address as<br>
the return path, not yours.  As a result when I reply in my mailer the<br>
response goes to the poster not you.  After I composed that reply I edited<br>
the headers and put your address in the To line.  That must be the reason<br>
for the blank message.  I deleted Marcus's message but I think I remember<br>
enough to recompose.  Here goes.<br>
<p>
Dealing with homosexuality in the church is not as huge a problem as we<br>
make.  It must be dealt with the same way as we deal with any other sin. <br>
Homosexual activity is no different from sexual activity between single<br>
Adventists.  It is foolish to assume that a pretty woman has a date and<br>
just as foolish to assume that one who looks or acts publicly as *gay* is<br>
engaged in sexual activity.  Surely we are not advocating camping under<br>
lovers' beds.  The church has never been given any authority to punish sin<br>
for God has reserved to Himself the right to decide to whom He will<br>
impute iniquity (Rom. 4:8).  If we really trust God we must trust Him<br>
enough to believe He will not allow sin into the kingdom.  The presence of<br>
sin on earth or in the church is no  indication of God's approval of it{<br>
<p>
Sex in the context of marriage cannot be wrong.  If homosexuals can be<br>
married in God's sight then sex between them cannot be wrong.  The<br>
question is Does God recognize homosexual marriages?  I see no evidence in<br>
the bible to support that.  The bible speaks of a man being joined to a<br>
wife.  It never speaks of marriage outside of the context of gender.  I<br>
cannot but conclude that same sex marriages, and therefore homosexual sex, is<br>
not accepted by God.<br>
<p>
This is where we have shot ourselves in the foot.  We teach that even if a<br>
marriage would not have been sanctioned by God He blesses it based on its<br>
civil legality.  That argument is often used to deny valid divorces to<br>
those who may have married for the wrong reasons.  What that argument does<br>
is force us to be duplicitous.  How do we relate to a homosexual marriage<br>
in a state where the civil laws allow it?<br>
<p>
Our problem comes from a practice I first observed here--TODOA: the open<br>
display of affection.  If we can justify this on the basis of cultural<br>
adjustments then how do we refuse it to those who those who may rightfully<br>
claim that their genes have been altered by the ravinging effects of sin? <br>
We must be consistent and not just show ourselves as only being interested<br>
in putting *others* in their place.<br>

This is a little quote from a book you all know well, that I was reading<br>
this morning. As I was reading it I realised something. See if you can<br>
see what I saw, to make it simpler I will be omitting some of the proper<br>
nouns from the text, and generalising others.<br>
<p>
<p>
"To the [..] and compromising, these arguments seemed conclusive. But there <br>
was another class that did not so judge. The fact that these customs "tended to<br>
bridge over the chasm between ..... [Babylon and God's Church]" was in their <br>
view a conclusive argument against retaining them. They looked upon them as <br>
badges of slavery from which they had been delivered and to which they had no<br>
disposition to return. They reasoned that God has in His word established the <br>
regulations governing His worship, and that men are not at liberty to add to<br>
these or to detract from them. The very beginning of the apostacy was in <br>
seeking to supplement the authority of God by that of the church. [..] began<br>
by enjoining what God had not forbidden, and she ended by forbidding what He <br>
had explicitly enjoined.<br>
<p>
Many earnestly desired to return to the purity and simplicity which <br>
characterised the primitive church........."<br>
<p>
Now we've even gone a step further no longer do we seek to "enjoining what <br>
God had not forbidden" we seek to enjoin that which He has specifically<br>
forbidden through His prophet. <br>
<p>
[of course now you can all accuse me of deliberately twisting and taking <br>
things out of context :^)]<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; From: Steven Timm &lt;st0o+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As a lifelong flatlander, I've often wondered how I would get out to </i><br>
<i>&gt; any sort of mountain when the persecution started.  </i><br>
<p>
I *knew* there was a reason I preferred living on the West Coast... :}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides this, to track me down electronically would be trivial.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps this is another argument for us to give up worldly things<br>
that bind us. Half :}, come to think of it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suspect a hand will just come out</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the terminal, slap on the handcuffs, and that will be it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do those of you who say that guns are needed to protect us in America from </i><br>
<i>&gt; our own government intend to take up arms whenever the death-decree folks</i><br>
<i>&gt; come after you?</i><br>
<p>
My own feeling is that by that time it may well be too late to do anything.<br>
<p>
It's the period before that point that may permit us to some things that<br>
might either hold it off a bit, or reduce a little the severity.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, there is some history during the 20th century of "death<br>
decrees" having been enacted, with differing degrees of success, ranging<br>
from the mass killings of Stalinist and Nazi times on down.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we miss something in focusing totally on an apocalyptic, worldwide<br>
event to the exclusion of more-regional events.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you think it will do any good to shoot a few of them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; And if you don't think you would do it in the ultimate situation, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; in any other situation?  </i><br>
<p>
By this argument one should not resist criminal attacks such as rape or<br>
assaults on children.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As long as we have the constitution to protect us from our own government,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we are fine.</i><br>
<p>
Then we're wasting time and money in contesting various First-Amendment-<br>
violating laws.  There's no point in publishing Listen magazine, either.<br>
<p>
I'm not serious.<br>
<p>
The constitutional guarantees did slave in the U.S. no good for a long time.<br>
<p>
Right now you can see evidence of government agents at various times and<br>
various places violating parts (or all) of the First, Second, Fourth, and<br>
Fifth amendments.  Just because the Bill of Rights guarantees a number of<br>
inherent, God-given rights doesn't mean that there might not be violations<br>
of those same rights. (The War on Drugs, among other faults, has been for<br>
some time a sort of justification for violating one or more of many persons'<br>
"inalienable right".)<br>
<p>
Who was it who said "put not your trust in princes"? (The concordance in<br>
the Bible here at work is *really* pitiful...) It's more true now than it<br>
was then, if for no other reason than current "princes" can do more damage<br>
that the ancients could.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If people ever mess with the constitution, they'll probably put</i><br>
<i>&gt; in gun control, too, so guns would not be available to do the job the</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitution could not.</i><br>
<p>
The Constitution is being messed with right now.  Has been for years.<br>
(And if you were to look at countries who currently ban civilian ownership<br>
of firearms, you'll find none that are completely-successful at it. In all<br>
cases, criminals still have access to, and use, firearms.)<br>
<p>
The main notion of the Second amendment was to provide one more check on<br>
the power of the State.  Also note that a militia could be called up for<br>
more than just defense against foreign invasion; the first police departments<br>
were set up with unarmed policemen who were to call out armed citizens at<br>
need to deal with criminals, both individuals and groups.<br>
<p>
Been a while since that's been done.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think that at the time of the end the only thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; we will be able to trust to protect us from our government is the power</i><br>
<i>&gt; of God,  and that is no less true now than it will be then.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps we should depend on prayer alone to deal with disease and injury.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we can go too far in either direction?  Where should the balance<br>
point stand? (We ought to eat/drink/exercise/etc. to avoid getting sick,<br>
but we often have to depend on physicians and surgeons when things still<br>
go wrong...and I don't know many who look on the medical work as some sort<br>
of abandonment of God's grace and power.  Over-reliance on the medical<br>
arm is something else again.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, we could follow the example of the old Quaker farmer who said,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Friend, I mean thee no harm but thou standest where I am about to shoot."</i><br>
<i>&gt; If I were to do that, I'd most probably shoot myself in the foot or something.</i><br>
<p>
While not everyone needs access to firearms, or even ought to have them, it<br>
doesn't seem right that all should be prohibited such access. In most cases,<br>
it should be up to the individual to choose.<br>
<p>
Even Jesus gave his disciples leave to arm themselves for self-defense...and<br>
it is equally clear that irresponsible use of them was not part of the package.<br>
<p>
Wouldn't it be nice if things were simple?  :{<br>

Hi netters:<br>
<p>
This is going to be my final say on guns.  It is obvious to me that<br>
we may never convince each other.  However, here is my final word:<br>
<p>
When this discussion started, it seemed to emphasize merely the<br>
traditions of owning merits of owning a weapon.  As, it progressed,<br>
we began to see more of what I consider ludicrous arguments about<br>
defending ourselves against tyrannical governments, and end time<br>
persecution.  Although this may seem to be a reasonable view to some,<br>
are we really suggesting that as persecuted Christians we will defend<br>
ourselves with automatic weapons or whatever weapons our laws allow?<br>
If this is the view of some, it seems to be contrary to what the<br>
Bible and EGW suggest the nature of end-times to be.<br>
<p>
Somalia is my example of gun ownership run amok; where the limitation<br>
of weapons to the citizenry would help rather tthan hurt.  There must<br>
be controls of some sort if order and not anarchy will be found in<br>
our society.<br>
<p>
My recent post was meant to be a sarcastic response to the suggestion<br>
that all citizens should own an automatic rifle to protect themselves.<br>
I'll apologize for the attempt at sarcasm, since some fellow-netters<br>
thought that I was trivializing the discussion.  However, my view is<br>
certainly not a minority opinion.<br>
<p>
If our kingdom is of this world, then we should fight.  Since it is<br>
not,  I will never buy a gun, own a gun, or use a gun (and since I'm<br>
a vegetarian, I don't plan to do any hunting).  I respect the<br>
constitutional rights of everyone who under law desires to own<br>
weapons, but I will retain the right to do without one.<br>
<p>
Thanks for the privelege of sharing my opinion.  Cheers Woody!<br>
<p>
PS: Steve's post also presents some wisdom on the subject.<br>

<i>&gt; . . .because I've wondered and taught about this in SS I once</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrote a continuation of the life of the thief on the cross which</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
Hello Jerry,<br>
<p>
Now you have me wondering.  What did you wonder about, and what<br>
did you teach?  We were all flat empty of good works when we were<br>
born again onto everlasting life, created in Christ Jesus for good<br>
works.<br>

<i>&gt; to spring in because I believe that SDA's should be aware of the end-time</i><br>
<i>&gt; significance of what's going on.  No, I don't mean that Koresh was the</i><br>

<i>&gt; is drifting in a most disturbing direction and it is not hard to see </i><br>
<i>&gt; how Sunday Law legislation could be inflicted soon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll start with some radical statements and then back them up with facts. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Radical statement:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Americans need guns to protect themselves against their own government.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Facts:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.  The people who wrote the constitution recognized this.  That is why it </i><br>
<i>&gt;     was written into the constitution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Thomas Jefferson was the one who said that the right to keep and bear</i><br>
<i>&gt;     arms was for the citizens to protect themselves from the government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
It's Friday afternoon, and I'm going to be foolish enough to jump into<br>
this again.  It is true that the Founding Fathers placed this in the<br>
constitution.  One must also remember that this was 200 years ago (and<br>
has been pointed out, but society and weapons technology were quite<br>
different), immediately after an armed rebellion against the government<br>
and in a society struggling to tame a wilderness.  No one can know for<br>
sure, but I would venture that if they were suddenly resurrected they<br>
might be shocked at how this has turned out.  Jefferson also recommended<br>
an armed rebellion every 30 years or so (we forget how radical he was).<br>
The one armed rebellion there was was a great national tragedy, as is<br>
the armed civil war going on in Yugoslavia today.  Little is recorded<br>
about what the "Founding Mothers" thought.  While it is true that many<br>
women own guns, they constitute a minority.  [Are guns a phallic symbol<br>
in our society?]  Seriously, I would like more female input in this<br>
discussion.<br>
<p>
I believe the discussion was begun by someone outside the US wondering<br>
why this was necessary in a democracy.  It's still a valid question.<br>
There are many functioning democracies in the world, and few of them<br>
have the level of gun-ownership that the U.S. does.  I'm wondering, for<br>
example, how things are in Australia?  I know in England the police<br>
often aren't even armed with firearms.  Perhaps Gandhi's ideals of<br>
non-violence would be a better model (as they are for the Mennonites).<br>
I believe Mao said power came out of the end of a gun.  For the moment<br>
in his country that may be true, but we've seen elsewhere the power of<br>
non-violent non-cooperation can have, and in the end will probably<br>
succeed in China as well.<br>
<p>
I'm wondering what evidence Mr. Helzerman has to back up his belief in<br>
an imminent Sunday law.  Some time ago, I sent a post on that subject.<br>
There was never any response.  I was surprised--either it was never sent<br>
or everyone must have agreed with me!  Even our church religious liberty<br>
people have had to admit that this is a non-issue in the U.S., and<br>
really hasn't been an issue since the turn of the century when<br>
conservative Protestants didn't like the loose Sunday habits of the<br>
Catholic immigrants.  Look around you.  More and more business is done<br>
on Sunday (including the first public library in Berrien County to open<br>
on Sunday so that our library is now not the only library in the county<br>
to be open on Sunday).  We live in a multi-cultural society (which not<br>
incidentally has a powerful Jewish lobby--check their influence on our<br>
foreign policy).  Much of the rest of the world is the same--secular<br>
and/or non-Christian or a liberal democracy.  The problem is that our<br>
eschatology (at least in that specific) is of the nineteenth century and<br>
is no longer "present truth," but we haven't the courage to admit it and<br>
find something more relevant to replace it (this is directly related to<br>
a problem of a literal reading of Ellen White).  I simply refuse to be<br>
paranoid about "last day events" and the need for a gun to protect my<br>
rights.  We need more of the love of Jesus.<br>
<p>

That's probably enough to get me in trouble today.<br>

Seventh-day Adventists have in one sense been at the forefront of the visual<br>
aid.  The various drawings of beasts and whatnot have given us a unique<br>
artform which has been used by many evangelists.  Many readers have probably<br>
seen the painting "The Way Of Life", later revised under commission from <br>
Ellen White under the title "Christ, the way of life".  <br>
<p>
SDA's have been on television with Faith For Today nearly as long as there <br>
has been television.  That's probably why television was never forbidden.<br>
Contemporary gospel music and emotional evangelistic appeals have also been<br>
around as long as there has been evangelism.  I think this is mostly a good <br>
thing.<br>
<p>
There is a danger involved with this, and that is that church members that <br>
are already grounded in the truth may grow to depend on the entertainment<br>
provided by these activities, and when the church activities do not provide<br>
enough, look elsewhere for the entertainment.<br>

I am deeply disturbed by the tone of conversation of the pro-gun forces<br>
on SDAnet.  It is merely another reflection of the militarism that is <br>
overtaking our church, and perhaps an effect of twenty years of non-stop<br>
TV violence.<br>
<p>
When I was a kid, they pointed to Desmond Doss as an SDA hero.  He worked<br>
in the face of war to save the lives of others, refusing to touch a gun<br>
himself.  For saving 75 lives in Okinawa during the 2nd World War, he won<br>
the Congressional Medal of Honor.<br>
<p>
The youth I teach now get to read about Ronald Tull, an SDA who went<br>
to the Persian Gulf during Desert Storm to shoot.  It was clear editorially<br>
where the SDA publications stood:  Saddam was EVIL, the USA was RIGHT,<br>
let's go bomb Iraq (notwithstanding SDA believers right in the thick of<br>
bombs).  Ronald Tull "The first SDA casualty of the war" was put forth<br>
as a<br>
hero.<br>
<p>
As sickening as I find that attitude, I find the current attitude expressed<br>
by the various proponents of guns even more distressing.  Nothing said<br>
about whether it is moral or not to have a weapon of lethal force.  <br>
Nothing said about whether Christians ought to be learning to use a weapon<br>
of force against fellow man.  Only political arguments "got to defend<br>
ourselves against the government."  These are the attitude that turn <br>
SDA doctrine-spouters into David Koreshes.  It sounds like Koresh would <br>
be a hero to some of you.  He "stood up against the tyrannical development,<br>
was ready to defend his family, etc. etc.".  God help us, what are we coming <br>
to?<br>
<p>
Does the idea of self-defense have any Biblical support?  It does have some,<br>
particularly in the book of Esther.  But nobody has mentioned that.  If we<br>
want to deal with the issues of self defense or killing in the name of God,<br>
then let's continue.  But SDAnet is not the place to rehash political<br>
hubris that is peculiar to the USA.  I'm not interested in what the<br>
constitution says, I am interested in what God says.<br>

Whenever I get into a discussion with a Jehovah's Witness, they often<br>
point to their belief that all war is wring, and that we should not be<br>
involved in the military.  (Interestingly, we have three Jehovah's<br>
Witnesses working for our Campus Police Department.  I am glad they are<br>
only security guards, since if I need back up, I know I could not depend<br>
on them to help, since they might have to get "violent") <br>
Anyway....................<br>
<p>
Back to the question about military involvement.  John the Baptist<br>
preached repentance.  Roman soldiers came to him to be baptized, asking<br>
what they must do to repent.  Oddly, they were never told to give up<br>
their careers as soldiers.<br>

I think your post was meant to be a response to the question of practical<br>
applications in dealing with homosexual members.<br>
<p>
If so, you are pecking at the assumed.  I respect your opinion of what<br>
you think God has said about homosexuality in the Bible.  It is likely that<br>
I disagree with the method by which you've chosen the opinion.<br>
<p>
The Bible does not speak of ministers being payed salaries, neither does<br>
it give approval for males to be sexual with female partners during<br>
menstruating.<br>
<p>
By the way, how _does_ the Church deal with single people?<br>

Hi, I realize that I am breaking in here, but I am a non-SDA and new to this<br>
list. I joined because I would like to find out more about the SDA church.<br>
I would appriciate it if someone would tell me about your church and its <br>
beliefs, structure, etc. I know a little bit about your church, and I would<br>
like to learn more. Thank you.<br>

As a gun owning SDA, I have to admit that I have not come up with all the<br>
answers to Steve's questions.  I have been looking for and thinking about<br>
what is the correct answer to them from a Christian perspective.  I will share<br>
some of my thoughts developed upto this point in time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do those of you who say that guns are needed to protect us in America from </i><br>
<i>&gt; our own government intend to take up arms whenever the death-decree folks</i><br>
<i>&gt; come after you?  Do you think it will do any good to shoot a few of them?</i><br>
<i>&gt; And if you don't think you would do it in the ultimate situation, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; in any other situation?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As long as we have the constitution to protect us from our own government,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we are fine.  If people ever mess with the constitution, they'll probably put</i><br>
<i>&gt; in gun control, too, so guns would not be available to do the job the</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitution could not.  I think that at the time of the end the only thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; we will be able to trust to protect us from our government is the power</i><br>
<i>&gt; of God,  and that is no less true now than it will be then.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
First off, I am not a militarist.  I own guns but not for being ready for the<br>
day our govt goes off the deep end.  I fully support the right to bear arms by<br>
those who abide by the law (as we know it today).  When an individual breaks<br>
the law, particularly involving the use of a gun, I say they have forfeited <br>
this right.  The same for those who are found mentally unstable and/or on drugs.<br>
I stand behind this right because when this very basic right is removed, watch<br>
out..other basic rights are going to be removed.  I also believe there is <br>
nothing to be gained by removing the right to bear arms and much to be lost!<br>
<p>
You ask about the day of death-decrees, etc.  Well, I think of the time of the<br>
end as a prophesied event so-to-speak.  It has been fortold and will happen.  I<br>
can not change what is prophesied.  We are told we will be put in prison, <br>
hiding in caves, running for our lives, etc.  To me, having a gun may or may not<br>
be very helpful.  In fact it will likely be a detriment at giving your position<br>
away to the searchers.  And if you are caught, it likely would make your life<br>
a bit more uncomfortable.  So I doubt that I will be carrying a gun come the<br>
time of the end.<br>
<p>
But as for now, in this time prior to Sunday laws and the public out looking<br>
for us, I think that we are living in a time of evil people running around<br>
hurting alot of innocent other people.  I can think of situations that could<br>
easily warrent the use of a gun in defense of yourself and/or your family.  I<br>
do not think that a gun should be your first line of defense, and probably<br>
your last, given the serious consequences.  But this decision is a personal<br>
one.<br>
<p>
The difference is basically this:  When the Sunday law is passed and death<br>
decree goes out, probation will have closed.  God's protection is promised<br>
for His people from that point on.  But prior to this time, there is a limit <br>
to God's protection for us... there are times when God has to let evil run its <br>
ugly coarse because of the great controversy and for the benefit of letting <br>
others see the natural results of sin.  This means that in some cases, <br>
innocent Godly people have been and will be killed.  <br>
<p>
So I have to ask, if God is letting sin run its coarse in some situations, <br>
then why can I not get involved in this "coarse" and defend myself and my <br>
loved ones from the evil?  Why be an innocent bystander or victim, hoping <br>
God will get you out of a situation when this may be one of those times He <br>
choses not to prevent it.  Or maybe He knows you have a gun and because He <br>
has given us a brain and hands and feet, He expects us to use them.  Would <br>
that not be just as much a help from God as sending an angel to blind the <br>
other guy?  Why does help from God always expected to be miraculous?  Can<br>
not the help be simply impressing upon us the right course of action in a<br>
given situation and letting us do the acting?  We are told that we are His<br>
hands and feet... does this exclude situations where God wants to protect<br>
us?  Or do we stand back and let God do the protecting?<br>
<p>
--Bruce<br>
<p>
PS:  Just because they may someday put gun prohibition into the constitution<br>
does not mean that suddenly guns are going to dissappear from people's houses.<br>

I too read that story.  But when I read it was more about <br>
christian life style (I mean reading Bible, not killing people),<br>
love of fellow soldier(American soldires :) ), home sick etc.  It <br>
was about a story of  a man, not a Rambo.  It was a human story<br>
rather than violence story.  I liked it when it said his fellow<br>
soldier was interested in reading Bible and how he witnessed even<br>
in that difficult situation.  And I think the Signs of the Times<br>
mentioned our church's official stand on owning a gun in the army.<br>
<p>
Well, my *personal* opinion : I hate guns.  I don't think I'll<br>
ever wants to use it.<br>

<p>
Agreed.  We must love the sinner but hate the sin.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The church has never been given any authority to punish sin</i><br>
<i>&gt; for God has reserved to Himself the right to decide to whom He will</i><br>
<i>&gt; impute iniquity (Rom. 4:8).</i><br>
<p>
The preceding statement is false.  Consider the following texts:<br>
<p>
	Exodus 21:12-36			1 Corinthians 5<br>
	Exodus 35:2			2 Thessalonians 3:6-15<br>
	Leviticus 18:22,29<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sex in the context of marriage cannot be wrong.</i><br>
<p>
The Biblical passages refer only ambiguously to "sexual immorality", but<br>
the following Spirit of Prophecy quotes are quite clear that even within<br>
the context of marriage, sexual excess is sinful:<br>
<p>
	AH 121-8		2T 391, 472-3, 480<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is where we have shot ourselves in the foot.  We teach that even if a</i><br>
<i>&gt; marriage would not have been sanctioned by God He blesses it based on its</i><br>
<i>&gt; civil legality.  That argument is often used to deny valid divorces to</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who may have married for the wrong reasons.  What that argument does</i><br>
<i>&gt; is force us to be duplicitous.  How do we relate to a homosexual marriage</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a state where the civil laws allow it?</i><br>
<p>
Paul (not the Lord) says not to divorce an unbeliever if the unbeliever is<br>
willing to stay, but that the unbeliever should be allowed to initiate the<br>
divorce (1 Corinthians 7:12-6).  This position is tenable if the married<br>
couple does not engage in improper sexual activity (see EGW references<br>
above).  Since homosexual activity is improper, the application of this<br>
principle to homosexual marriages is inappropriate.<br>

Guns and Finland:<br>
<p>
I am really surprised about the discussion of Guns and SDA, and have been telling<br>
myself reading the posts "the americans are crazy..". I do not wear guns<br>
and spent one year in the finnish army as a noncombattant. There are<br>
quite a few Finnish adventist that spent the war years 1940-45 in prison<br>
because they refused to bear weapons.<br>
<p>
I think that those who have weapons in their house  for protecting<br>
themselves (I think this will exlude hunting) are about to break <br>
the sixth commandment - in my Bible there are no exclusions in that <br>
commandment. I think one more, still more important reason for not <br>
having weapons is that when you kill a person - for any reason - you <br>
place yourself in the place of God - who only is the Lord of the living <br>
and dead. As I understand it - that was the sole reason for<br>
evil to coming into existence - Lucifer putting himself in place of<br>
the Most Highest.<br>

I've heard that 15 million women in the US own a hand gun.  I don't know <br>
if that's alot of women or not, but I do think it's significant that more <br>
women are taking it upon themselves to protect themselves form attack.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then we're wasting time and money in contesting various First-Amendment-</i><br>
<i>&gt; violating laws.  There's no point in publishing Listen magazine, either.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not serious.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The constitutional guarantees did slave in the U.S. no good for a long time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Right now you can see evidence of government agents at various times and</i><br>
<i>&gt; various places violating parts (or all) of the First, Second, Fourth, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fifth amendments.  Just because the Bill of Rights guarantees a number of</i><br>
<i>&gt; inherent, God-given rights doesn't mean that there might not be violations</i><br>
<i>&gt; of those same rights. (The War on Drugs, among other faults, has been for</i><br>
<i>&gt; some time a sort of justification for violating one or more of many persons'</i><br>
<i>&gt; "inalienable right".)</i><br>
<p>
This is a true statement.  Individuals have had their "constitutional rights<br>
taken from them from the beginning of the Country.  This may be hard for<br>
some of us to believe, but the documentation is not very hard to find.  I<br>
offered some in the past, I offer it again.`<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Who was it who said "put not your trust in princes"? (The concordance in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Bible here at work is *really* pitiful...) It's more true now than it</i><br>
<i>&gt; was then, if for no other reason than current "princes" can do more damage</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the ancients could.</i><br>
<p>
Yes we cannot put our trust in Bill Clinton, George Bush, or the constitution.<br>
As was noted above, people have lost their rights at the whim of some leader<br>
throughout American history.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If people ever mess with the constitution, they'll probably put</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in gun control, too, so guns would not be available to do the job the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; constitution could not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Constitution is being messed with right now.  Has been for years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (And if you were to look at countries who currently ban civilian ownership</i><br>
<i>&gt; of firearms, you'll find none that are completely-successful at it. In all</i><br>
<i>&gt; cases, criminals still have access to, and use, firearms.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The main notion of the Second amendment was to provide one more check on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the power of the State.  Also note that a militia could be called up for</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than just defense against foreign invasion; the first police departments</i><br>
<i>&gt; were set up with unarmed policemen who were to call out armed citizens at</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to deal with criminals, both individuals and groups.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Been a while since that's been done.</i><br>
<p>
And as was said, some groups have had this right taken from them.  They don't<br>
need to change the constitution.  They just have to disregard it.<br>
and this has been done.<br>

This is in response to Steve's posting some time ago.  The 1992<br>
_Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches_ gives the following<br>
information.  The church entered the colonies as the Church of England<br>
(Anglican Church), but changed its name to Protestant Episcopal in 1789<br>
in an attempt to distance itself from the British Crown (it had been the<br>
established church in several colonies).  Its name changed again in 1967<br>
to Episcopal Church.  Episcopal is a reference to the fact that the<br>
church has bishops (as does the Methodist Episcopal Church).  I believe<br>
members of this church are called Episcopalians rather than Episcopals.<br>
More US presidents have been Episcopalians (including George Bush) than<br>
any other church.  The National Cathedral (also called the Washington<br>
Cathedral or the Cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Paul--guess they<br>
couldn't make up their minds!) is Episcopalian.  [I saw some cute books<br>
there about "Episcocats".]<br>
<p>
The yearbook also says this:  "The beliefs and practices of the<br>
Episcopal Church, like those of other Anglican churches, are both<br>
Catholic and Reformed, with bishops in the apostolic succession and the<br>
historic creeds of Christendom regarded as essential elements of faith<br>
and order, along with the primary authority of Holy Scripture and the<br>
two chief sacraments of Baptism and Eucharist."  Even though the<br>
original break with Rome was over power rather than theology it would be<br>
a mistake to conclude that England did not have a Reformation or that<br>
the Reformation had no theological impact on the Anglican Church.  They<br>
did retain, however, much of the liturgy of the Catholic Church,<br>
although in an English way (for example, music is much more important in<br>
the Anglican/Episcopal liturgy than it is in most Catholic churches).<br>
The reformation in England was an ongoing one.  Both the Puritan<br>
movement (to purify the Anglican Church) with the resultant<br>
Congregational Church (later United Church of Christ) and the Methodist<br>
Church came out of Anglicanism.  Like the English constitution, the<br>
English church has evolved.<br>
<p>
Most early Adventists did not come from the high church tradition, but<br>
from the working and lower classes which tended to go to churches with a<br>
simpler style of worship.  Ellen White, I believe, was Methodist and<br>
James White came from the Christian Connection.  It should not be<br>
surprising that our worship service follows this style (which is also<br>
similar to Baptist).  Adventists came out of a number of Protestant<br>
churches.  It is unfortunate that reverence in church is not an<br>
important element in the Adventist worship style (as it is in many of<br>
the liturgical churches, including Orthodox).  Worship services should<br>
try to combine meeting the congregation's informational needs as well as<br>
the need to worship God.  Getting the correct balance is not easy.<br>

Has anyone read the introduction to The Great Controversy?  Has anyone<br>
read 1Selected Messages?  Has anyone read Acts, and the accounts which<br>
occurred in the young Christian church re: doctrine, Jews/Gentiles, and the<br>
Jerusalem Counsel or Convention?<br>
<p>
What, or rather, WHO is our focus?  Putting our focus where it should be,<br>
upon Jesus Christ, does not nullify doing good works.  To the contrary!<br>
Christ will work His works, and live his life through us.<br>
<p>
I know I've mentioned it before, but various tones in net discussions make me<br>
want to mention it again.  Alden Thompson, a religion professor at Walla Walla<br>
college has written a great book, (excellent = I agree w/ everything) <br>
book called<br>
"Inspiration".  I invite you and all net folk to read it if you <br>
haven't, or if you already<br>
have, *prayerfully* re-read it.<br>

<i>&gt; sanctification. I completely disagree that conservatives fear that without</i><br>
<i>&gt; the people being deceived into believing salvation by works they will become</i><br>
<i>&gt; lawless and decadent. If this is what you think conservatives are about</i><br>
<i>&gt; then you are mistaken. This salvation by works issue is a staw man set up by</i><br>
<i>&gt; some in order to get the unaffiliated on side. Was EGW a legalist ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; did she want to deceive people into legalism ? Well the same applies</i><br>
<i>&gt; to conservatives as applied to her. Of course I know some people will </i><br>
<i>&gt; say that EGW was a legalist. But then that is only because we have a new </i><br>
<i>&gt; definition of legalism. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Legalism used to be defined as attempting to be saved by our own</i><br>
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
<i>&gt; merits in doing works, nowdays legalism in some quaters has come to mean</i><br>
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
<i>&gt; anybody who thinks works have any role in the Christian life. Well for those </i><br>
<i>&gt; who think they don't, tell me one thing, how will you be judged ?</i><br>
<p>
The underlined text is the correct definition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Its especially true that any unbalanced understanding of the gospel leads </i><br>
<i>&gt; to lawlessness and the salvation by works concept leads to just as much </i><br>
<i>&gt; lawlessness as the anitnomian one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
[Most of the text John Prosper included deleted.  What's left is from Ruben<br>
Gonzalez SCT]<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thats exactly the problem, what do we believe ? what we used to believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; or what we are now told we are supposed to believe ? There are two gospels</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the church today, we are not talking two viewpoints, we are talking</i><br>
<i>&gt; two separate and distinct gospels.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Those who have really studied the issues on both sides of the fence will</i><br>
<i>&gt; tell you that there can be no compromise between both sides. There are two</i><br>
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
<i>&gt; paths, and they both lead in separate directions. Of course very few have</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually done a profound study on both sides of the issues and so</i><br>
<i>&gt; will not appreciate that even though some things sound similar they lead</i><br>
<i>&gt; down completely different paths.</i><br>
<p>
There is no compromise with Divine Truth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Should we change the pillars of our faith to be more accomodating for those </i><br>
<i>&gt; who don't believe ? If so then where do we draw the line ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I have passed through a number of different churches before I became a<br>
SDA-ist.  Wherever I have gone, the issue of legalism is always raised and<br>
discussed as though it is a difficult concept to grasp.  On one extreme there<br>
are those who argue that belief in the Grace imparted through Calvary is<br>
sufficient and that no good works are necessary.  The proponents of this<br>
thinking turn a deaf ear (and blind eye) to scripture -- "Faith without works<br>
is dead".  On the other extreme are those who preach and pursue the Law,<br>
paying meticulous attention to the letter of the Law and little or none to the<br>
spirit in which It was coded.<br>
<p>
Is the issue really so difficult to state clearly?<br>
<p>
The primary mistake with the former extreme seems to be the definition of<br>
'belief' in salvation.  Those who hold to this seem to constrain the term<br>
'belief' to a passive sense (i.e., the mere intellectual acceptance of an<br>
idea) rather than the active, dynamic tenor which the gospel implies.  To<br>
believe in Christ implies the complete acceptance of everything which is<br>
Christ's -- including good works.  (A mere passive belief makes us no<br>
better than Satan.)  Our works ARE necessary for salvation, but they are<br>
not sufficient!  The Salvation wrought by Christ is both necessary and<br>
sufficient (with the qualifier) for those who completely accepts Christ!<br>
-- this embraces the Law.<br>
<p>
Nevertheless, it is foolish to take this to the opposite extreme and begin to<br>
worship the Law.  We were created to be stewards of all that the Lord has<br>
given us.  Just as the earth is a part of the House of Heaven, the Law is the<br>
House Policy.  As good stewards we are expected to abide by that Policy.<br>
However, just as it is foolish to worship creation besides the Creator, it is<br>
likewise ridiculous to worship the Law besides the Law Giver.<br>
<p>
Legalism, then, is merely another manifestation of idolatry and a violation of<br>
the first two commandments.  I don't think EGW or any other prophet gave<br>
any impression of worshipping the Law and, hence, cannot be properly<br>
labelled as legalists.<br>

Randy Helzerman's response (&gt;) to my post (&gt;&gt;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; These are the attitude that turn </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; SDA doctrine-spouters into David Koreshes.  It sounds like Koresh would </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; be a hero to some of you.  He "stood up against the tyrannical development,</i><br>
p&gt;&gt; was ready to defend his family, etc. etc.".  God help us, what are<br>
we coming <br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Time out Steve, don't you think that's a little bit of a low blow?</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps so.  I don't suspect that anyone will start having sex with young<br>
girls and calling himself the Lamb of God just because he has a lot of guns.<br>
But I think some SDA's relate to David Koresh just as the Republican party<br>
related to David Duke.  They don't agree with his womanizing or messiah<br>
claims (just as Rep. party didn't like Duke's past in the Nazi party).<br>
But they admired him for standing up to the feds, defending his family, <br>
etc. and viewed him as a martyr rather than a self-deluded maniac.<br>
I don't think I would be exaggerating to say that there are probably <br>
many folx in Texas, including SDA's, who have similar types if not numbers<br>
of weapons, and similar attitudes to the government.<br>

Just so the fearmongers don't run out of new things to talk about:<br>
<p>
What restrictions to religious liberty could be imposed by a leftist <br>
government?  <br>
<p>
I thought about this because of a court case in which three members <br>
are suing their union because they do not want their union dues used<br>
to support abortion.  They claim religious reasons.  We could see a <br>
national health care plan soon in the United States that includes taxes<br>
to support abortion.  <br>
<p>
What about enforcing political correctness into law?  Does this have <br>
any implications?  Comments are welcome.<br>

<i>&gt; Very simple, baptise them!!!</i><br>

It is a pity you did not elaborate.  If it is that simple I would it would<br>
be as simple for a remarried divorced person (not for the accepted reason)<br>
who requests baptism, right?<br>

Steve:<br>
<p>
I read Beng's letter with great interest and to some extent sadness.  I too<br>
have grown up Adventist and have heard the term "lukewarm" applied to us as<br>
long as I can remember, even before celebration churches existed or before we<br>
seriously debated whether to accept into fellowship homosexual or transsexual<br>
individuals or before members felt it appropriate to go gambling or to the<br>
movies.  (Lest I sound too much like a grandpa, I am 34, but the church has<br>
changed a lot since the 1960's when I was growing up, much of it for the<br>
better.)  Behavior is different now but the underlying problem is still the<br>
same.  We need more personal Godliness.<br>
<p>
Beng quoted the passage from Revelation to the church in Laodicea and in it<br>
is a beautiful promise: "Behold I stand at the door and knock: if any man<br>
hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him and will sup with<br>
him, and he with me." Rev. 3:20.  My favorite example of Christ having supper<br>
with people is in Luke 24:13-35.  This story is life changing.  It tells the<br>
story of two men returning from Jerusalem devastated because Jesus had been<br>
crucified.  They said with downcast faces, "we had hoped that he was the one<br>
who was going to redeem Isreal" Luke 24:21.  Christ, unknown to the men,<br>
began to walk with them and to unfold the scriptural story.  He revealed how<br>
all of the events which the travellers had witnessed were fulfillments of<br>
prophecy.  He then joined them for supper and "When He was at the table with<br>
them he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.  <br>
Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him, and He disappeared from<br>
their sight."  Luke 24:30-31.  Their lives were changed!!!  They ran back to<br>
Jerusalem and became part of the group which testified of Jesus as the Risen<br>
Lord.  40 days later the Holy Spirit exploded upon Jerusalem in the "sound<br>
like the blowing of a violent wind" (Acts 2:2) and tongues of fire were seen<br>
over the heads of the believers.  Peter, speaking by inspiration of the Holy<br>
Spirit traced the story from the words of the prophet Joel and King David. <br>
Peter also repeated the call to "Repent and be baptised every one of you in<br>
the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.  And you will<br>
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."(Acts 2:38)  <br>
<p>
We are not the inheritors of a dead tradition but instead we are the<br>
spiritual children of a Living God.  When we are called to repent we are<br>
called out of ourselves into a better life of freedom in Christ.  We are<br>
promised power to deliver us from our sins.  If God calls homosexuality sin<br>
(1Cor.6:9-11), those of us who have this affliction are promised power to<br>
escape this sin.  If God calls adultery or fornication sin, those tempted are<br>
promised power to escape.  This is also true of gambling, backbiting, hatred,<br>
pride or any other disgusting human fraility.<br>
<p>
In saying this, I don't suggest that we should set ourselves up as spiritual<br>
"judge, jury and executioner".  Rather, let us follow the advice of 1Cor. 13<br>
and Colossians 3.  "Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved,<br>
clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and<br>
patience.  Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have<br>
against one another.  Forgive as the Lord forgave you.  And over all these<br>
virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity." Col.<br>
3:12-14.  Those individuals who struggle with sin in all of its forms should<br>
be welcomed into fellowship and treated with love.  Anyone who sins be it<br>
adulterers, homosexuals, gossips, proud imperious "jerks" or whoever they may<br>
be are to be made welcome unless they refuse to follow Jesus.<br>
<p>
I am excited by what the Bible says.  It promises us power and hope.  Read<br>
some of these passages and see if you don't agree!!!<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks for reading,<br>
Ron Swensen<br>

Steve,<br>
	I grew up without television.  It was not until I was in college that<br>
I watched televison for more than 1 or 2 hours a YEAR. Literally. then I<br>
watched a *LOT* of Startrek, Moonbase Alpha, and other science fiction.<br>
I turned my Tv off 7 years ago, (except for occasional news, such as<br>
elections, the riots in LA, and the Waco thing).  We don't watch anything<br>
with violenc in it.<br>
Cheers<br>
Woody<br>

[Darius A. Lecointe writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; We teach that even if a</i><br>
<i>&gt; marriage would not have been sanctioned by God He blesses it based on its</i><br>
<i>&gt; civil legality.</i><br>
<p>
Doesn't ring a bell with me.  The closest I can come is two concepts:<br>
1) If a guy and a girl became one flesh (i.e., had sexual intercourse),<br>
then that required them to get married.  This I did hear, but it was not<br>
based upon civil law (at least in my day); and no one suggested that they<br>
then have God's blessing (as in the blessing one gets in living righteously).<br>
[The OT civil laws in this regard have broader purposes than is at first<br>
apparent to us.]<br>
2) If the one you marry is not in God's best will, you do not perforce<br>
sever yourself forever from God's grace.  Indeed, God's grace is always<br>
available to those who humble themselves under God's hand (James 4:6,<br>
1 Pet 5:5b,6).  God's amazing grace can work miracles in changing lives.<br>
However, this is distinct from the blessings that come from living in His will.<br>
<p>
God uses permanent relationships to illustrate eternal principles.<br>

I have read the various posts relating to guns with increasing degrees of <br>
alarm.  The idea that the constitutional provision with respect to the <br>
bearing of arms will in anyway help us in the day of persecution is so <br>
foreign to my understanding of last-day events as taught in Adventism that <br>
I truly wonder whether I belong to the same church that some of my fellow <br>
SDAnetters do. <br>
<p>
There seem to be two problems wrong with this notion.<br>
1.  There is no reference in the New Testament scripture of christians <br>
resisting persecution by "defending themselves."  On the contrary, the <br>
experience of Jesus and the apostles was always a humble, even joyful <br>
acceptance of persecution. There is also the example of Paul using the <br>
legal means at his disposal and appealing to Rome.  But never is there a <br>
hint of physical self-defence.   Indeed, one wouAnd one would expect no <br>
less of person's whose ethical charter is the Sermon on the Mount ... "love <br>
your enemies","pray for those who persecute you" etc. Would Hus, for <br>
example, have been better of arming himself against the Bohemian <br>
authorities?  Christ said "If my kingdom were of this world, then would my <br>
servants fight"<br>
<p>
2.  The emphasis, even reliance on the U. S. constitution as some kind of <br>
hedge during the time of trouble ignores the fact that in the very <br>
interpretation of end-time events that is being appealed to, this very <br>
constitution would be perverted (as EGW says) as a precursor to the end <br>
time persecution.  I personally have some concerns about the <br>
Americanization of our doctrinal positions, and would question how the <br>
Sunday Law would apply to muslim countries, for example.  But within the <br>
accepted interpretation, arming ourselves is an aberrant (and abhorrent as <br>
well)  position, both to the spirit of Christanity in general and to <br>
Adventism in particular.<br>

<i>&gt; Subject: "Arsenal" at Waco?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; According to the 7 Jun 93 US NEWS &amp; WORLD REPORT (p. 42), the "arsenal"</i><br>
<i>&gt; acquired by the Branch Davidians at Mount Carmel was comprised of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; following:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;                59 handguns</i><br>
<i>&gt;                12 shotguns</i><br>
<i>&gt;                94 rifles</i><br>
<i>&gt;              + 45 machine guns</i><br>
<i>&gt;              -----------------</i><br>
<i>&gt;               210 firearms</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Divided into the population of Mount Carmel as of 28 Feb 93, which was</i><br>
<i>&gt; approximately 130 persons, this comes to 1.6 firearms per individual.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; The 1990 population of Texas was approximately 17 million.  The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; recent estimate I have seen of the total number of firearms in Texas</i><br>
<i>&gt; --- regrettably, I cannot recall the source --- was 64 million.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; therefore assume per capita firearms ownership in Texas to be on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; close order of 3.8, which means:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. The Branch Davidians were more lightly armed, by a factor of at</i><br>
<i>&gt;    least 2, than Texas as a whole.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2. Any randomly selected neighborhood in any city or small town in</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Texas with a population of 130 people would contain nearly 500</i><br>
<i>&gt;    firearms of all types.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3. The BATF could conduct much larger (and safer) seizures by simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;    cordoning off city blocks and doing house-to-house searches.  I note</i><br>
<i>&gt;    that Ross Perot has advocated exactly this --- for black</i><br>
<i>&gt;    neighborhoods in south Dallas, that is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Permission is hereby granted to copy this everywhere you can think of.</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Radical statement:  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Americans need guns to protect themselves against their own government.</i><br>
<p>
I'd amend that to read that we do need to protect ourselves (and<br>
others) from excesses of our own government.  There are a wide range<br>
of tools for doing so, guns being only one, and the last of all, at<br>
that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1.  The people who wrote the constitution recognized this.  That is why it </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;     was written into the constitution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's Friday afternoon, and I'm going to be foolish enough to jump into</i><br>
<i>&gt; this again.  It is true that the Founding Fathers placed this in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitution.  One must also remember that this was 200 years ago (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; has been pointed out, but society and weapons technology were quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; different), immediately after an armed rebellion against the government</i><br>
<i>&gt; and in a society struggling to tame a wilderness.</i><br>
<p>
Puckle, and others, had described in patent applications and otherwise<br>
every workable method for fully-automatic firearms before the 1770's.<br>
Franklin, if not Jefferson, probably were aware of these technical<br>
explorations, and I doubt if they missed many of the most obvious<br>
implications of such weapons.  Still...  <br>
<p>
The Founding Fathers (FF's hereafter) could not have imagined radio,<br>
television, media marketing, laser printers, and the like either. The<br>
fact of the existence of such do not invalidate the utility of the<br>
First Amendment, while they might make its existence less comfortable<br>
than it was even then.<br>
<p>
While the overall shape of society is different now, the basic<br>
problems of acquiring needs, criminal threat, abuses of power by<br>
govenments and individuals was there then, and are still with us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; While it is true that many women own guns, they constitute a minority.</i><br>
<p>
One of the most important purposes of our nation's construction (not<br>
forgetting all you non-USAnians here!) is the protection of the rights<br>
of minorities of all sorts who might deviate from majority practice or<br>
thought.  Toleration, at least.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  [Are guns a phallic symbol in our society?]</i><br>
<p>
Not according to a number of studies on the question.  The only ones I've<br>
met who seem to think so, also tend to not own or use guns.  But then, I<br>
don't deal with psych/sociology if I can help it. I can barely keep up<br>
with computers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I know in England the police often aren't even armed with firearms.</i><br>
<p>
This is becoming less and less the case.  Metropolitan areas are beginning<br>
to use more special armed squads available for use in situations where<br>
the local unarmed police are outmatched.  Their violent-crime rate is rising<br>
quite a bit faster than the the U.S. rate, and the number of with-gun<br>
violent crimes is rising with it.  (Before the first of the modern gun-control<br>
laws was enacted in the early 1920's, England's rate was about 1.20th of<br>
the U.S. rate at the same time, now it's closer to about 1/4th.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps Gandhi's ideals of non-violence would be a better model (as</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are for the Mennonites).</i><br>
<p>
Gandhi's use of ahimsa would not have worked as well, perhaps at all, had<br>
India been part of someone else's empire.  The British were, on the whole,<br>
basically sympathetic to his goals.  If India had been part of, say, a<br>
1940's German empire...<br>
<p>
But his approach is certainly worth emulation, even as one should not<br>
underestimate the potential costs. (Remember what happened to Gandhi,<br>
both Mohandas and Indira, in the end. And what has gone on in India <br>
since then.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I simply refuse to be paranoid about "last day events" and the need</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a gun to protect my rights.</i><br>
<p>
You're probably right there.  The gun you don't want (and I wouldn't<br>
want to force anyone to take up arms if they don't want to, and would<br>
discourage anyone from taking them up otherwise) is *not* the only<br>
tool that (may) be needed for "protecting my rights". If used at all,<br>
it should be the very last resort.<br>
<p>
But one shouldn't think that *no* tools should be taken up for this<br>
sort of effort. Prayer first, other action to follow.<br>
<p>
While it looks as though secularization is proceeding inexorably in<br>
our society, don't forget that there have been (and likely will be)<br>
wild swings in public mood regarding such things.  There have been<br>
great swings in U.S. history, from religious to secular, from temperance<br>
to non.<br>
<p>
Imagine the possibility of the U.S. economy getting *really* wrecked.<br>
Imagine that a liberal administration were perceived as the cause of the<br>
trouble. A huge conservative backlash ("to return to the values and<br>
goals that made our country great") might follow, with the doers of evil<br>
being enthusiastically punished.  And if things didn't get better quickly,<br>
how likely that the label of "evildoer" might not spread out wider and<br>
wider, until anyone deviating from the "norm" might be swept into the<br>
net.<br>
<p>
Could czarist Russia have foreseen the Stalinist era back in 1893? Could<br>
any German have believed that Hitler and the Nazi's might arise from<br>
thirty or forty years before?<br>
<p>
The devil doesn't care if we're vigilant or not...he does what he can<br>
get away with.<br>
<p>
I hope I'm wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We need more of the love of Jesus.</i><br>
<p>
Now *that* has not, and will not, change.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's probably enough to get me in trouble today.</i><br>
<p>
Isn't that what email is for? :}<br>

<i>&gt; I truely believe that if the framers of the constituion</i><br>
<i>&gt; had been able to conceputlize a fully automatic weapon, and had been able to </i><br>
<i>&gt; forsee what our government would ultimatly do, they would have worded the</i><br>
<i>&gt; amendment slightly diffrently.  Such as: ....to bear arms OF ANY TYPE OR</i><br>
<i>&gt; CLASSIFICATION shall not be infringed...</i><br>
<p>
The Second Amendment say that "the right to keep and bear arms shall not<br>
be infringed".<br>
<p>
While people almost invariably see that in terms of firearms, note that<br>
the militia of the time also used knives, swords, pikes (though not so<br>
widely as before), hatchets and so on.<br>
<p>
A number of the FF's owned their own cannon, btw.<br>

<i>&gt; From: "lsusers"  &lt;LSARCHER@scifac.indstate.edu&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As, it progressed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we began to see more of what I consider ludicrous arguments about</i><br>
<i>&gt; defending ourselves against tyrannical governments, and end time</i><br>
<i>&gt; persecution.  </i><br>
<p>
The U.S. Army, while not specifically interested in end-time events,<br>
does concern itself with fighting against irregular forces.  In short,<br>
they don't like the idea...it's very expensive for the regulars.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Although this may seem to be a reasonable view to some,</i><br>
<i>&gt; are we really suggesting that as persecuted Christians we will defend</i><br>
<i>&gt; ourselves with automatic weapons or whatever weapons our laws allow?</i><br>
<p>
Not necessarily...there are other ways of doing the job.<br>
<p>
A lot of people don't realize that there are something between 600K<br>
and 1M with-gun defenses each year in the U.S. (Hart, 1981; Mauser, 1990;<br>
about six other studies of less usefulness, dealing with local populations.)<br>
The *vast* majority do not end with injury or death (or attacker or defender),<br>
most don't even involve firing the gun.  In most cases, once the agressor knows<br>
that the defender is armed, the attack is broken off.<br>
<p>
This sort of usage, btw, is more in line with the likeliest reason<br>
for citizens' weapon ownership being useful in restraining excesses<br>
of a government; it becomes less certain that said government might<br>
feel it could get away something shady.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Somalia is my example of gun ownership run amok; where the limitation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of weapons to the citizenry would help rather than hurt.</i><br>
<p>
The average Somali can't get weapons, while the warlord bands have no<br>
effective curb to their excesses. It might be useful if Somalia had a<br>
government to deal with the warlords...but as it is, some can exercise<br>
force, the majority have no way to counter them.<br>
<p>
I'm not saying, btw, that arming everyone will make things better...but<br>
*everyone* being armed is *not* what is causing the trouble in the<br>
country.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If our kingdom is of this world, then we should fight.</i><br>
<p>
Granted. (But then, there is fighting, and there is fighting.  Different<br>
opponents, different problems, different tools, different solutions.)<br>
<p>
In the story of Esther, the end result of Haman's machinations was that,<br>
since the law couldn't be changed, the Jews were permitted to take up<br>
arms in their own defense...and the expected slaughter didn't take place.<br>
<p>
Why did Jesus, in Luke 22: 35-36 say that the disciples acquire arms<br>
(a sword was the local equivalent of a handgun) for their personal<br>
defense?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not,  I will never buy a gun, own a gun, or use a gun (and since I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; a vegetarian, I don't plan to do any hunting).</i><br>
<p>
OK (but I think you're mixing more than one issue here).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I respect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; constitutional rights of everyone who under law desires to own</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons, but I will retain the right to do without one.</i><br>
<p>
Excellent. I respect your choice.<br>
<p>
Some would coerce others to conform to their point of view, whichever <br>
side would do that would be wrong.<br>

I've never read the book, Selected Messages untill I picked it up a couple of<br>
weeks ago.  The Seventh-day Adventist church has been blessed to have<br>
such a person as Ellen White, keeping afresh the principles of God's<br>
character and kingdom for a "last day people".<br>
<p>
Again, we have been truly blessed....<br>

<p>
Aren't the 'simple' beliefs that your describe applicable to<br>
most Christian religions?  What do you believe as an SDA?<br>

<i>&gt; I think your post was meant to be a response to the question of practical</i><br>
<i>&gt; applications in dealing with homosexual members.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If so, you are pecking at the assumed.  I respect your opinion of what</i><br>
<i>&gt; you think God has said about homosexuality in the Bible.  It is likely that</i><br>
<i>&gt; I disagree with the method by which you've chosen the opinion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
It would help if you elaborated on that passage.  I have no idea what your<br>
opinions are so cannot debate them.  And what do you mean by "pecking at<br>
the assumed?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Bible does not speak of ministers being payed salaries, neither does</i><br>
<i>&gt; it give approval for males to be sexual with female partners during</i><br>
<i>&gt; menstruating.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I find it strange to hear this argument about menstruation from a<br>
Seventh-day Adventist.  Sounds more like someone arguing against the<br>
applicability of the Ten Commandments to Gentiles.  Exactly what aspect of<br>
my post elicited this response?  I have no way of knowing what I am<br>
expected to debate aroung.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By the way, how _does_ the Church deal with single people?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
My point was that no matter how the church deals with single people who<br>
fornicate the same should apply to "single" practicing homosexuals.  There<br>
is not justification for targeting a particular group of people.  I do not<br>
care for the lifestyle but I am tired of the church's inconsistencies and<br>
double standards.  If we cannot uphold standards at a certain level let us<br>
not pretend to be so tough on sin.<br>

<i>&gt;on &lt;other crop&gt;?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Email replies appreciated.</i><br>
<p>
I'm following up on the group because I think that this is an important<br>
topic. From Tino's embryonic nuclear faq:<br>
<p>
Average annual individual doses in mrems from natural and man-made         <br>
radiation sources:<br>
<p>
Source                   Exposed Group    Body Portion Exposed    Indiv. Dose<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Natural Radiation:<br>
  External sources:<br>
    Cosmic Rays          Total population      whole body              28<br>
    Terrestial gammas    Total population      whole body              26<br>
    Radon and daughters  Total population      bronchial epithelium  ~150<br>
<p>
Man-made Radiation:<br>
  Tobacco                Smokers (1.5 packs/d) bronchial epithelium  8000<br>
<p>
The tobacco leaf is rather large, and in the growing season, has the      <br>
opportunity to pick up a lot of Polonium-210, which, like radon, is a<br>
daughter product of natural uranium and thorium decay. According to LaMarsh <br>
(Intro. to Nuclear Eng.), Radon, a noble gas, can diffuse out of the ground<br>
into the atmosphere. When it decays down to Po-210, the dust or moisture<br>
that it has attached itself to can land on a leaf. When you smoke it, you<br>
trap that isotope in your lungs. It happily decays away, kicking off<br>
5.3 MeV alpha particles with a half-life of 138 days. Since alpha particles<br>
are the worst form of ionizing radiation to have trapped in your body, they<br>
do a fine job of destroying any lung tissue that surrounds them.<br>
<p>
The tobacco industry and the medical profession know this, and one group<br>
doesn't want to admit it. The reason other plants don't bother you is because<br>
alpha particles can get flushed out of your digestive system, but _not_ out<br>
of the lungs.<br>
<p>
If everyone knew just what the hell was going into their body (and not coming<br>
out), I suspect the human lifespan would increase noticeably...<br>
<p>
At your service,<br>
<p>

I think guns &amp; gun control has been hashed out now to the point where<br>
we are beginning to repeat ourselves.  There have been good arguements<br>
on both sides of the story.  I saved this clipping of this letter to the<br>
editor from WSU's student newspaper, The Evergreen.  It appears that <br>
they were having an arguement much like ours.  Although the approach<br>
is simplistic, I think there is a little truth is what he says.<br>
<p>
GIVE PEACE A CHANCE, PLEASE<br>
<p>
Editor:<br>
  I would like to make a few comments about the apparent debate columns <br>
concerning the right bear arms published the 10th of February.<br>
  No one denies the fact that guns are able to take a human life.  Then<br>
again, so do cars, cancer and cheese burgers.  The question is, will<br>
removing the rights of the citizen to keep and bear arms reduce its death<br>
toll.<br>
  The answer is, it probably would.  But, at what cost to individual<br>
rights and liberties?<br>
  Let's suppose, for arguement's sake, that I wanted you dead and that all<br>
registered firearms were suddenly transmorgified into Petunias.  How<br>
would I get the job done?  Among others, I could reach into my closet and<br>
pull out my legally unregistered black powder, muzzle loading, Kentucky<br>
long rifle which I legally bought at age 15 without a waiting period.<br>
True, it is only a single shot, but I am pretty confident you would have<br>
at least a bad powder burn and some lost hearing.  The point is that <br>
owning a deadly weapon such as a gun, bow and arrow, baseball bat, pointy<br>
stick or catapult is not the activity a government should be regulating.<br>
The wanton taking of human life is the activity which needs to be<br>
addressed more closely.<br>
  However, there is a point to one of the anti-gun movement's arguements.<br>
The world would be a nicer place to live in if all guns were banned.  All<br>
guns, meaning yours, mine, Bosnia's, Somalia's, Iran's, Israel's, US<br>
military's, police, big guns, artillery, flying guns, floating guns, <br>
nuclear guns.  I wish I could see that day.<br>
<p>
  Andrew Peek<br>
<p>
All spelling errors and mistypes are mine.<br>
<p>
BTW: I own two guns.  Used to make pretty good money in South Dakota <br>
shooting rats at the dump.  Some old ladies got real mad at the city <br>
when their cats died from eating poisoned rats.  No, I don't hunt for<br>
food.  Yes, I do shoot feral dogs.  Particularly after they ate one of <br>
my cat's and attacked a little kid two miles down the road from my home <br>
in New Mexico.  Would I shoot a human?  No, although I have had a legal <br>
chance to.  Our house lives on a mesa close to a route that illegal <br>
mexicans like to take north.  Our neighbors, although close, can not see <br>
the house.  Thus, on occasion, attempts have been made to steal things from<br>
our yard or break into our house.  I will say this:  It was amazing how<br>
fast a person dropped its knife and disappeared when I let fly into the <br>
the ground several yards behind the window it was forcing.  However, I<br>
must warn you that this is not a way to encourage your trees to grow when<br>
you shoot with a .44 magnum.  And yes, I was praying pretty hard and not<br>
a litle scared.  Dad didn't like the hole in his tree (the second one I've<br>
managed to mangle) and my ears rang for a week.  But dad does like the<br>
knife the person left behind.<br>
Hmmm... the wild west is over, eh?<br>
<p>
Food for thought, no?<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>

Darius suggests that offering baptism to the transexual person would be the<br>
same as offering baptism to the remarried (improperly) person in a divorce.<br>
<p>
Such a statement assumes that there are still any teeth in the church's <br>
policy on divorce and remarriage.  Such is not the case.  It is not unheard<br>
of today for man and wife to divorce, both remarry, and both remain in <br>
the SDA ministry, not to mention membership.  Perhaps the policy was <br>
ill-advised from the start, but as far as I can tell it is now non-existent.<br>
I've not heard of anyone being under church discipline for divorce and <br>
remarriage for the last ten years.<br>
<p>
Perhaps this is why the homosexual argument now has more hearing than it <br>
once did.  If the church could say that it really treats all of what it terms<br>
adultery the same way, then there would not be so much accusation of <br>
singling one group out.  But divorce, even among the ministry, has become<br>
so common that the rationalizers have rationalized "the majority do it, <br>
so it must be OK."<br>

Well, before picking on the left, I would advise you to have a look at the<br>
publication "Church and State" which is published by the American's United<br>
for Separation of Church and State. The board of directors boasts MANY<br>
SDA and Baptist clergy. It identifies the real enemy of church and state<br>
separtation as the Relgious Right.<br>
<p>
<p>
[The SDA establishment has done nothing but pick on the religious right<br>
for the last 16 years.  This, however, represents quite a shift from the <br>
early 1960's, when the gloom 'n doomers were predicting that John F. Kennedy,<br>
a Catholic, would sell the country over to the Pope.  The plots of the <br>
religious right are regularly discussed on SDAnet.  I thought perhaps <br>
it was time to look at the left (and I speak as a Democrat).  SCT]<br>

<i>|I am a "recovering Catholic;"  that is to say, I have almost purged all of the</i><br>
<i>|detrimental teachings of that particular sect from my brain.  I spent a year</i><br>
<i>|in the seminary, on my way to becoming a priest (or so I thought).  I give you</i><br>
<i>|this background to let you know that my search for God (long since abandoned)</i><br>
<i>|is no fly by night, passing concern.  </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Here's the question that no Christian can answer.  How do you know God's will?</i><br>
<i>| Let's assume you need to make a very important decision, and in Christian</i><br>
<i>|fervor pray over the matter in order to discover God's will.  You pray, and</i><br>
<i>|some sign or another (which you of course interpret as a sign, using your</i><br>
<i>|mind) comes to you.  You then decide what to do.  Note those words *YOU*</i><br>
<i>|*Decide* what to do.  </i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|If one wants to pass off the responsibility for making a decision to what one</i><br>
<i>|perceives as God and his will, that is your right.  However, ultimately</i><br>
<i>|knowing what to do is up to the thinking individual, even *if* you deign to</i><br>
<i>|call the decision God's will.</i><br>
<p>
This one has bothered me for awhile too.  I've seen people pray and pray and<br>
never able to make a decision on their own without some "sign" from God, what<br>
ever that might be.  I've also seen people hide their own failings behind God.<br>
I've finally decided on the following method:<br>
<p>
1. I take a good look at the examples of decisions made by people in the Bible,<br>
what little history I know and comtemporary people I know and respect.  And I<br>
pray.<br>
<p>
2. Then I make a decision, and tell God what I've decided to do and ask for<br>
his input.  A basic "if this isn't right for me, close the door." kind of<br>
prayer.<br>
<p>
3. If whatever endevor I'm undertaking blows up or for some reason doesn't<br>
happen, I'm responsible.  And if it does work, I'm still responsible.  But it<br>
sure is nice when God supports you.  At least, I choose to interpret some<br>
things that have happened in my life as unexplainable except for God taking<br>
a hand.<br>
<p>
Perhaps it is not the most theologically stable method, but it means I can <br>
get things done without wearing out my knees and always wondering if what <br>
I'm hearing is God's "sign" to me.  However, I've walked out on a limb and <br>
cut it off behind me before.  It is interesting that God &amp; I generally managed <br>
to pick me up quicker when I tried to figure out what might have been better<br>
then just sitting there blaiming God.<br>
<p>
Yeah, it would be nice to have a god that would always clearly point out what<br>
he wants for us or what is best for us.  But that would take all the fun out<br>
of life.  Where would the challenge of being an individual be?  But I do think<br>
that if I take the time to look at all sides of the problem: past, present,<br>
future, and what God might have in mind, I make a much better decision.  <br>
<p>
Note:  By saying what God might have in mind, I mean what the picture of God<br>
I have in my head would have in mind.  And the real God has gone and proved<br>
my picture pretty flawed in the past.<br>
<p>
Cheers!<br>

Marcus posted recently in reference to the Two and the Ten, <br>
being different representations but all part of the one Law of God.<br>
Though he didn't mention it specifically, this is one of the ideas <br>
found in Alden Thompson's book, "Inspiration".  It is also Alden Thompson<br>
who includes as prefaces to his book both the introduction to the Great<br>
Controversy and the several sections of Selected Messages to which Marcus<br>
is referring.  I own this book and have read it several times, and I think <br>
most of the ideas are good ideas that deserve much more hearing.<br>
<p>
Applying this principle to guns:<br>
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" from the Two<br>
"Thou shalt not kill" from the Ten.<br>
<p>
Nevertheless we know of many situations in the Bible where God ordered<br>
others to kill.  Saul was punished for not killing the Amalekites.<br>
The children of Israel were supposed to totally destroy the various <br>
Canaanite tribes.  Then there are all the crimes in the law of Moses<br>
for which the death penalty was prescribed.  There are instructions<br>
in the Bible to "beat the plowshares into swords."  (and vice versa).<br>
Then there is the story of Elisha calling fire from heaven down on <br>
the companies of soldiers.  And we musn't forget the various plagues<br>
that the Lord sent first on the Egyptians, then on the children of Israel<br>
as they wandered in the wilderness.<br>
<p>
(There is another book by Alden Thompson called "Who's afraid of the <br>
Old Testament God", which I have not yet read.  I understand it speaks to<br>
these issues and more.)<br>
<p>
If we are to view the Bible as casebook and not codebook, what does this<br>
suggest as to how we are to handle the issues of violence.  We may safely<br>
say that those episodes are not only to boost the Bible's ratings.  <br>
Looking at what God and Jesus did is only the first step.  There are things<br>
that Jesus did that I couldn't do myself without it being a sin for me.<br>
(Driving the money-changers out of the temple with the cord, for instance).<br>
Through the guidance of the Holy Spirit I believe we can learn to know<br>
what actions we can undertake in the name of God while still possessing <br>
the spirit of God.<br>
<p>
One of the questions that is in the big list of questions from alt.atheism<br>
is <br>
<p>
"If your God told you to take a rifle and go out and start shooting people,<br>
would you do it?"  We can't say it doesn't happen because it did happen.<br>
<p>
How to answer?<br>

This is in response to the question of LAINIE@delphi.com<br>
<p>
We have an extensive list of 27 fundamental beliefs, which I am sending<br>
under separate cover.  But here is a list of 5 items which I heard<br>
recently proposed by Ray Tetz of the core of SDA beliefs. <br>
<p>
1)  The Bible is the word of God<br>
<p>
2)  Jesus is the Son of God<br>
<p>
3)  God loves me and has a plan for my life<br>
<p>
4)  God cares about the quality of my life here and now<br>
<p>
5)  God wants to spend quality time with me (both here and hereafter).<br>
<p>
Most of the SDA distinctive beliefs are special cases of #4 and 5.<br>
<p>
Current church membership ~7 million.<br>
About 10-15% of that in US and Canada.<br>
<p>
Let us know if you want to hear more.<br>
As you have seen, there is a wide diversity on just what SDA's do believe<br>
and I'm sure that I will hear comments from all 20 sides on the above list.<br>

Indeed, I meant no offense. I simply wanted to point out that much concern<br>
must be with the Right. But yes, I could see how a leftist government could<br>
argue that a particular group was against the public interest and try and<br>
break up or harrass the group.<br>

Here are a few books on Spirituality in dealing with women/AIDS/sex roles<br>
and sexual orientation issues.<br>
<p>
None are SDA books, maybe there's already a FAQ listing them.<br>
I know Ron Springett from Southern College wrote a book a few years ago.<br>
I made this list about a year ago, and am pleased to say that since then,<br>
quite a bit more has been written about each subject.  I hope this helps<br>
people.<br>

	sexual revolution did not provide: an understanding of the true meaning of<br>
	love.  Topics include: the genitalization of sex to the neglect of <br>
intimacy and<br>
	sensuousness; a sense of separation that works against true intimacy; the<br>
	difficulties men have in establishing friends, particularly with other <br>
men, and<br>
	the need for friendship with God.<br>
		140 pp., paperback, $8.95<br>
16.  "Gay/Lesbian Liberation: A Biblical Perspective"  by George R. Edwards<br>
	This book shows, on Biblical grounds, that gay/lesbian liberation rightfully<br>
	belongs to the genre of liberation theology, that the homophobic rejection<br>
	of gay/lesbian persons by the churches and synagogue cannot claim<br>
	Biblical sanction.<br>
		153 pages, paperback, $9.95<br>
17. "Pastoral Ministry in the AIDS Era"  by Louis Kavar<br>

	and chosen relatedness.<br>

18.  "Beyond Sex Roles"  by Gilbert Bilezikian<br>

	theological study by a committed evangelical teacher that affirms full<br>
	equality of the sexes in church and family.<br>
		300 pages, paperback, $12.95<br>

	homosexuality.<br>
		158 pages, paperback, $8.95<br>
25.  "Gays Under Grace"  by Maury Johnston<br>
	A Christian's response to the Moral Majority.  This book is meant to be an<br>
	aggressive attack upon the anti-gay ideology of "Falwellian"<br>
	fundamentalism as well as an objectively critical review of various<br>
	life-styles among some gay Christians which only tend to give more<br>
	credence to the extremist accusations that all gays are "immoral and<br>
	perverted."<br>

But Dan,<br>
<p>
Don't you see that these instances of judging are after we have<br>
trampled on the great law of love to God, and fellow human?<br>
<p>
If I love God with all my hear soul and mind, and my neighbor<br>
as myself, why would I be hitting someone with a stone during<br>
a heated quarrel?  Ironically Ex 21:23,24 are the life for life, eye<br>
for eye, tooth for tooth... verses.  I think Jesus says some different<br>
stuff in the New Testament.  If we continue the thinking that<br>
pre-incarnate Christ was "God" leading in OT, then either God<br>
is contradicting Himself or these laws should be read in context<br>
of time and culture.<br>
<p>
Same goes for the rest of the OT passages you site.<br>
<p>
I couldn't help but think of a phrase Ellen White uses in Selected<br>
Messages.  I remember it because she repeats is to often:<br>
"truth for our time".  This is different from the principles in scripture<br>
which are for all time.  Some people call it the "spirit of the law."<br>

Added comment.  1 Cor 5 does support judging those inside the church,<br>
and expelling "the wicked man from among you."  In chapter 4, Paul speaks<br>
against judging.  Some background information is needed, the thought<br>
can't change so drastically without a reason.  What is Paul talking about?<br>
I personally am confused and will have to read and pray about it.<br>

The following post illustrates my point.  Apparently we operate on<br>
expediency.  Raises the question of whether our leaders really allow Jesus<br>
into their counsels or whether we simply follow along with what is<br>
popularly discussed among mainstream churches.  We do not look much like<br>
leaders.<br>
<p>
If church policy is not consistent then why do we simply drop the issue of<br>
church discipline.  After all church membership or participation is not<br>
the test for entrance into the kingdom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In-Reply-To: &lt;199306070043.AA59808@garnet.acns.fsu.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Darius suggests that offering baptism to the transexual person would be the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same as offering baptism to the remarried (improperly) person in a divorce.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Such a statement assumes that there are still any teeth in the church's </i><br>
<i>&gt; policy on divorce and remarriage.  Such is not the case.  It is not unheard</i><br>
<i>&gt; of today for man and wife to divorce, both remarry, and both remain in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the SDA ministry, not to mention membership.  Perhaps the policy was </i><br>
<i>&gt; ill-advised from the start, but as far as I can tell it is now non-existent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've not heard of anyone being under church discipline for divorce and </i><br>
<i>&gt; remarriage for the last ten years.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps this is why the homosexual argument now has more hearing than it </i><br>
<i>&gt; once did.  If the church could say that it really treats all of what it terms</i><br>
<i>&gt; adultery the same way, then there would not be so much accusation of </i><br>
<i>&gt; singling one group out.  But divorce, even among the ministry, has become</i><br>
<i>&gt; so common that the rationalizers have rationalized "the majority do it, </i><br>
<i>&gt; so it must be OK."</i><br>

Come on, if you did NOT know they had a sex-change operation you would not<br>
have a problem with a converted person.  Christ didn't have a problem with<br>
a prositute, an extorionist, a sneak thief (Judas), or anyone else.  He<br>
saw all people as children of God, and died for all of them.  If someone<br>
had a sex change operation(s) it makes no diffrence to God if they accept<br>
him, and give thier life to him, he takes it.  We should have the same <br>
broad tolerance.  Our limitiations are that we can't see the heart, so<br>
we have NO right to judge another.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Agreed.  We must love the sinner but hate the sin.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The church has never been given any authority to punish sin</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for God has reserved to Himself the right to decide to whom He will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; impute iniquity (Rom. 4:8).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The preceding statement is false.  Consider the following texts:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Exodus 21:12-36			1 Corinthians 5</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Exodus 35:2			2 Thessalonians 3:6-15</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Leviticus 18:22,29</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
You need to read those passages again, *then* read my statement.  In  fact<br>
seems like you need to read the entire NT also.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sex in the context of marriage cannot be wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Biblical passages refer only ambiguously to "sexual immorality", but</i><br>
<i>&gt; the following Spirit of Prophecy quotes are quite clear that even within</i><br>
<i>&gt; the context of marriage, sexual excess is sinful:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	AH 121-8		2T 391, 472-3, 480</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Certainly you noticed *you* are the one who used the word excess.  Excess<br>
is always wrong, no matter what the act--good or bad.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is where we have shot ourselves in the foot.  We teach that even if a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; marriage would not have been sanctioned by God He blesses it based on its</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; civil legality.  That argument is often used to deny valid divorces to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; those who may have married for the wrong reasons.  What that argument does</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is force us to be duplicitous.  How do we relate to a homosexual marriage</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in a state where the civil laws allow it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Paul (not the Lord) says not to divorce an unbeliever if the unbeliever is</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to stay, but that the unbeliever should be allowed to initiate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; divorce (1 Corinthians 7:12-6).  This position is tenable if the married</i><br>
<i>&gt; couple does not engage in improper sexual activity (see EGW references</i><br>
<i>&gt; above).  Since homosexual activity is improper, the application of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle to homosexual marriages is inappropriate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Here you misinterpreted Paul.  My point had nothing to do when a partner<br>
in a marriage decides to leave.  I am speaking of when the union is<br>
entered into by people of two different belief systems.  Let us not<br>
confuse issues here.<br>
<p>
I have left my original posts so you can react to them in the proper context.<br>

<i>&gt; 1.  There is no reference in the New Testament scripture of christians </i><br>

This has persuaded me.  However, re historical examples such as:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would Hus, for example, have been better of arming himself against</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Bohemian authorities?</i><br>
<p>
Re Bohemians (most of them Sabbatarians, btw), check out Wylie re the<br>
blind general Ziska.  Re Waldenses:  Many times they retreated into<br>
mountain hideouts, but sometimes they defended themselves (e.g. an instance<br>
late in their history involving Henri/Enrico Arnaud).  Re Huguenots:<br>
Similar sort of thing, altho more self-defense.  Evidently they all wrestled<br>
with the issue of whether to defend themselves with arms.  For further<br>
reading, those from my generation will probably recognize the titles<br>
"Strangers in the Land", "Brave Men to the Battle", "The Wrath of the King",<br>
"Home to their Valleys (?)".<br>
<p>
While we probably cannot determine conclusively if God's best was for<br>
them to defend themselves with arms, it is evident that in many cases<br>
God gave them victory by means supernatural.  Finally, I note that<br>
Luther repeatedly implored the German princes to let God be their<br>
defender, not their arms.<br>

I am a convert to Seventh-Day Adventism.<br>
<p>
Several factors influenced my decision to be baptized.<br>
<p>
First, there is a sense of family within the Adventist church.  This<br>
effect is most pronounced when meeting fellow Adventists while travelling.<br>
The shared beliefs, especially in the areas of eschatology and lifestyle,<br>
create a bond that is difficult to describe but easy to recognize.<br>
<p>
The most important theological idea in Adventism is the unity of Bible. <br>
Many Christian churches teach that the Old Testament is obsolete and that<br>
the Father of the Old Testament is only worried with punishment while the<br>
New Testament Jesus is only concerned with love; Adventists belief that<br>
the gospel is the same in both the Old and New Testaments, that the only<br>
real changes were that the sacrificial system is no longer necessary and<br>
the theocracy of Israel no longer is a part of God's plan.  Justice and<br>
mercy are both evident in both the Old and New Testaments.  I understand<br>
that Steve has sent you a copy of the 27 fundamental beliefs.  If you have<br>
any questions regarding those or any other aspect of Adventism, feel free<br>
to ask again.<br>
<p>
Yours in Christ,<br>
<p>

Darius Lecointe asks a valid question concerning attitudes toward those<br>
who have undergone sex change operations.  Some of the replies, however,<br>
have been somewhat glib.  The unspoken assumption is that the person<br>
in question underwent the operation of their own free will in their<br>
adult years.<br>
<p>
This does injustice to the problem of intersexuality, which is a<br>
developmental disorder.  On that level, it becomes a little like asking<br>
how to witness to someone with a developmental disorder that did not<br>
involve gender, such as a club foot or a cleft<br>
palate.  You get into a situation like John 9 where the disciples asked<br>
whether someone was born blind because of a sin they themselves<br>
committed or a sin their parents committed.  <br>
<p>
I can't say I have an easy answer to this one -- that's when you know<br>
you've got a good question.  But let me stir up the mix with something<br>
from the Out Of The Mouthes of Babes Dept:<br>
<p>
     'Stephen' was referred at the age of 5 years [to physicians; a<br>
     clinical diagnosis confirmed that while the child had the external<br>
     appearance of being a boy it was in fact a girl].  A plastic<br>
     surgical procedure was carried out...and Stephen became Stephanie....<br>
     The mother's immediate reaction on learning of the child's true sex<br>
     was to leave matters as they were, but after urging from the family<br>
     doctor she finally agreed to accept the advice that the sex should<br>
     be changed.  The child on being told what was to be done ran<br>
     delightedly out of the house calling into houses down the street<br>
     that God was turning him into a girl.... [from: Dewhurst and<br>
     Gordon, _The Intersexual Disorders_, 1969, London, pp. 128-129].<br>
<p>
Make of it what you will.<br>

<i>&gt;I've not heard of anyone being under church discipline for divorce and </i><br>
<i>&gt;remarriage for the last ten years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
We have a situation in our church where a two times divorced male had an affair<br>
with someone's wife and after several attempts to get him off the lady, he<br>
refused.  Let me here stress that the lady was also very willing.  Anyway, the<br>
ultimate happened.  They were both disfellowshpped; the lady's husband left the<br>
church (not the denomination) and went to fellowship with a near by church. <br>
The lady subsequently sought divorce and married this "gentleman" in court - of<br>
course.  Now they are requesting baptism and the vocal members of the church<br>
will not allow it.  Those who may permit it have held their peace.  <br>
<p>
I guess the strongest argument is that "We are not going to place our blessing<br>
on someone breaking up anyone's family."<br>
<p>
So. Steve, these two people are still under church discipline and they are very<br>
regular and punctual in church also!<br>

was not aware that there had been any church discipline.  I stand corrected.<br>

<i>&gt; sever yourself forever from God's grace.  Indeed, God's grace is always</i><br>
<i>&gt; available to those who humble themselves under God's hand (James 4:6,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1 Pet 5:5b,6).  God's amazing grace can work miracles in changing lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, this is distinct from the blessings that come from living in</i><br>
His will.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; God uses permanent relationships to illustrate eternal principles.</i><br>
<p>
It seems Fred has been listening to the wrong bells.  I was not referring<br>
to OT times.  The SDA church was not around then.  We accept as valid a<br>
marriage between a Seventh-day Adventist and a "non-believer" even though<br>
we will not allow our ministers to conduct the ceremony in an SDA church. <br>
(At least that was true when I was in the active ministry).  I am not<br>
speaking of situations where the situation changed during the marriage. <br>
With our strong reactions to un-wed pregnancies every woman who got<br>
pregnant in a marriage like I described would have to be disciplined.  We<br>
*do* recognize marriages the state recognizes.  In fact that is why we<br>
require a marriage license.<br>

[Again, this is a custom that is falling by the boards.  Our pastor has
performed several "mixed marriages" in our SDA church, one SDA, the 
other not.  Also it is not uncommon to see SDA pastors go to churches 
of other denominations to wed one SDA and one not.  SCT]

When I think of the question of what is the spirit of the law, <br>
I look to the sermon on the mount, Matthew 5.  This is where Jesus<br>
was showing how one needs to go beyond the written requirements<br>
of the law  "He that looks at a woman to lust after her hath committed<br>
adultery in his heart."  <br>
<p>
So we should not assume that the spirit of the law is any more lenient<br>
than the letter of the law.<br>

It seems that those who say "God loves the sinner, but hates the sin"<br>
spend most of their time hating the sin in such a way that it is hard for<br>
the sinner to tell whether the hate is aimed at him or his sin.<br>
<p>
I propose that when the words "God loves you, but" are spoken, it doesn't<br>
matter what follows the "but".  All effect of the "God loves you" is <br>
subsumed in the "but".  The phrase "God loves the sinner, but hates the sin"<br>
is not to be found in the Bible.  (God does hate some things as described <br>
in the Bible and this is an interesting side-study).<br>
<p>
How about:  God loves you enough to accept you just the way you are,<br>
and too much to let you stay that way.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; So. Steve, these two people are still under church discipline</i><br>
<i>&gt; and they are very regular and punctual in church also!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bill Oblitey</i><br>
<p>
So, where is the church discipline?  How can they still attend<br>
church?  In Matthew 18:17, Jesus says to treat them as one would<br>
a pagan or a tax collector.  In I Corinthians 5:11-13, Paul<br>
instructs us not to associate with them, not to eat with them,<br>
but to expell them from among us.<br>
<p>
Would they attend a potluck?  Don't they feel strange sitting<br>
alone at a table set for ten?  What happens when, as they take<br>
their seat in Sabbath school, the teacher pronounces judgment<br>
against them and suspends the class?  Read Numbers 16:23-26.<br>
In the worship service, what happens when all the people near<br>
them (say +/- three pews) vacate their seats, and the pastor<br>
pronounces judgment against them?<br>
<p>
Church discipline, like God's judgment, is a terrible thing.<br>
We, like God, go to great lengths to avoid it.  But when<br>
necessary, it must be enforced, like God's judgment.<br>
<p>

I know you mean that you don't watch any *fictional* shows with violence<br>
in them, but three out of the four items that you list are chock full of<br>
violence.  Just something to consider.<br>

<p>
Precisely.  Yea, it calls us to an even higher level of commitment to<br>
Christ and His principles being lived out in our lives.<br>
<p>
Love God with everything you've got, and your neighbor as yourself.<br>
We must first know God (not just ABOUT God) in order to truly love God.<br>
Loving God will overflow into loving humans.  Can't love God while we<br>
are unloving to humans.<br>

<i>&gt; Well, before picking on the left, I would advise you to have a look at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the publication "Church and State" which is published by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; American's United for Separation of Church and State. The board of</i><br>
<i>&gt; directors boasts MANY SDA and Baptist clergy. It identifies the real</i><br>
<i>&gt; enemy of church and state separtation as the Relgious Right.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [The SDA establishment has done nothing but pick on the religious</i><br>
<i>&gt; right for the last 16 years.  This, however, represents quite a shift</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the early 1960's, when the gloom 'n doomers were predicting that</i><br>
<i>&gt; John F. Kennedy, a Catholic, would sell the country over to the Pope.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The plots of the religious right are regularly discussed on SDAnet.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought perhaps it was time to look at the left (and I speak as a</i><br>

I think the SDA establishment is wrong on two counts.  First of all,<br>
anytime you become obsessed with one danger you become blind to<br>
others.  For example, no one actually knows how the Sunday Law will<br>
come into being at the end of time.  I could come up with plausible<br>
scenarios involving the Right, the Left, or the Middle.<br>
<p>
Second, in political terms worldwide the Left has typically been more<br>
coercive than the Right.  A typical Left philosophy is "we own you<br>
body and soul";  examples are Communist countries and to a lesser<br>
extent places like Sweden.  The Right, on the other hand, says "we<br>
don't want any political competition from you".  Examples are Asian<br>
countries like Taiwan and Korea (which have since liberalized), and<br>
South American countries such as Chile and Argentina (also<br>
liberalized).<br>

I'm curious.  Does "truth for our time" also apply to<br>
Ellen White?  That is, does her counsel get reduced in<br>
impact because of time and circumstance?  Doesn't the<br>
answer have to be affirmative as to EGW if one adopts<br>
the affirmative to the same question for the Old Testament?<br>

Seriously though, non-fictional violence is still a concern with regard<br>
to television. Some news services like to show "scenes which may be disturbing<br>
to sensitive viewers" a bit more than necessary.<br>

<p>
I only stated my simple beliefs because too often I find SDA people state<br>
the negatives of the SDA church.  Such as, because I'm a SDA I don't eat<br>
meat, don't drink coffee, don't have sex before marriage. Far too often my<br>
friends often leave out the most important part, that God loves me and I<br>
love him.  Of course I believe the 27 fundamentals of the SDA church but I<br>
was just giving my  non-SDA friend, in my opinion the most important<br>
belief.<br>

<i>&gt;subsumed in the "but".  The phrase "God loves the sinner, but hates the sin"</i><br>
<i>&gt;is not to be found in the Bible.  (God does hate some things as described </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How about:  God loves you enough to accept you just the way you are,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and too much to let you stay that way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
Good point Steve.<br>
<p>
In my reading of the Old Testament I've had a few thoughts on these matters.<br>
I think what I conclude is that God, although hating sin, really isn't as<br>
concerned about perfection or our good acts as we often act like he is.<br>
What he really wants is a state of mind. A willingness to learn, to be<br>
corrected (by him), a love for him. <br>
<p>
God knew David was bloodthirsty and had too many women and was a bad father.<br>
But he called him a man after his own heart.<br>
<p>
It just goes to show that we really can't judge because we only see the<br>
outside. A persons motivations are hidden from us but not from God.<br>

Thanks for the bibliography, Marcus.  Librarians are always looking for<br>
bood bibliographies to assist in collection development.  I checked our<br>
catalog, and found that we already own about 2/3 of these (hope some are<br>
read by seminarians and others).  The others I ordered.  It's really<br>
wonderful to be able to do all this from my desk.  I simply use the<br>
telnet command for multiple logins so that I can flip from e-mail to the<br>
online catalog search menu and the electronic ordering menu.  Really<br>
great.  Takes a lot less time than it used to also (won't talk about the<br>
time it takes to set this thing up and clean up the database--just spent<br>
the better part of a day straightening out the subject headings for<br>
books of the Bible, would be too bad if we couldn't find those!)<br>

Just yesterday I had the dean of the School of Graduate Studies at the<br>
Adventist International Institute of Advanced Studies (what a mouthful)<br>
in the Philippines in my office talking about Internet possibilities, especiallyhow we might share library resources.  Somehow we will need to find ways<br>
for many small entities to share these resources, but that will take<br>
some leadership.  We really need to get the GC interested in these<br>
issues.  Great possibilities.<br>

Jerry asks:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm curious.  Does "truth for our time" also apply to</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ellen White?</i><br>
<p>
The answer is: YES<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;That is, does her counsel get reduced in</i><br>
<i>&gt;impact because of time and circumstance?  Doesn't the</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer have to be affirmative as to EGW if one adopts</i><br>
<i>&gt;the affirmative to the same question for the Old Testament?</i><br>
<p>
The answer is again :YES.<br>
<p>
The problem is that we too often want to to apply her writings<br>
verbatim instead of following thew principles of truth.  That's why<br>
we still have the debate about cinema vs T.V, wedding bands or not<br>
etc.  All truth is contextual, otherwise we would still not be riding<br>
bicycles and our dress and lifestyle would resemble the Amish.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Added comment.  1 Cor 5 does support judging those inside the church,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and expelling "the wicked man from among you."  In chapter 4, Paul speaks</i><br>
<i>&gt; against judging.  Some background information is needed, the thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't change so drastically without a reason.  What is Paul talking about?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I personally am confused and will have to read and pray about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
This post may not be a follow-up to mine, but the connection is there so I<br>
will reply.  BTW it would be nice if posters would take the extra time to<br>
include the matter they are responding to.<br>
[Au contraire.  Most people are including far too much included text <br>
in their posts.  The best is none at all.  Never include a whole post<br>
in your reply.  This costs people (including me) real disk space!  SCT]<br>
<p>
My point remains that God has not asked the church to judge sin.  That is<br>
his domain.  Expelling a man from the church is nothing more than a social<br>
statement.  In many instances the guilty party has already received God's<br>
forgiveness *before* the act of discipline.<br>

 From Steve:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why don't we have the situations such as Ananias and Sapphira</i><br>
<i>&gt;happening anymore?  Judging in the NT church happened early and</i><br>
<i>&gt;often.</i><br>
<p>
Probably the "judgers" are themselves in need of judgment...pot<br>
calling the kettle black... or the act of judgment is motivated<br>
by condemnation of the individual rather than the activity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Should it grow out of a Spirit-based authority?  I think so.</i><br>
<p>
It's the JESUS way. But with that authority goes resposibility.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  We should be careful to recognize the difference between dumping</i><br>
<i>&gt;guilt on someone and condemning them  (bad) and thwarting the</i><br>
<i>&gt;unchecked spread of evil in the church (good). Just because we cease</i><br>
<i>&gt;condemning people does not mean that there ceases to be right and</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrong.</i><br>
<p>
Actually we should be condemning the activity rather than the people.<br>
Jesus said to Mary:  "Neither do I condemn you".  However, the fact<br>
that he continued: "Go and sin no more", indicates that right and<br>
wrong continue to exist.<br>
<p>
There is now no condemnation to those who are in CHRIST JESUS!  God's<br>
condemnation.  Condemning people is not ours to do.  If we condemn<br>
someone, could we really pray for them?  What do you netters think?<br>
<p>

I fail to understand how someone can read 1st Corinthians 4 through 6 and<br>
still say that the church is not supposed to judge.  There are warnings<br>
in 1 Corinthians 4 against premature judging, that's for sure.  But<br>
1 Corinthians 5 is telling the corinthians that they ought to be judging<br>
a certain brother, and 1 corinthians 6 says that the believers should <br>
judge matters within the church and not the secular courts.  <br>
It's one of the most strident calls to judgment in the Bible.<br>

<i>&gt; The phrase "God loves the sinner, but hates the sin"</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not to be found in the Bible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How about:  God loves you enough to accept you just the way you are,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and too much to let you stay that way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve Timm</i><br>
------------<br>
Neither is your phrase or its equivalent to be found in the Bible.<br>
What you do find is:<br>
<p>
   Jn. 3:3  You are unacceptable the way you are; you must be<br>
   born from above.<br>
<p>
   Jn. 3:16  God loved unacceptable sinners so much that he<br>
   provided a sacrifice to make them acceptable--his son.<br>
<p>
   Jn. 5:14  If you would be acceptable before God, sin no more.<br>
<p>
   Rom. 5:8  God demonstrated his love toward us, in that while<br>
   we were yet unacceptable sinners, Christ died for us.<br>

<i>&gt; [Jesus] saw all people as children of God.</i><br>
<p>
I just finished reading through about 30 messages from the net,<br>
and the statement above was made three different times.  Would<br>
anyone care to defend it in the light of John 1:12.<br>

Thanks,<br>

<i>&gt; Just because we cease condemning people does not mean that there ceases</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be right and wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Steve:<br>
<p>
I've tried to sort through this issue and I keep coming back to the same<br>
personal roadblock: my perception of judgment.<br>
<p>
Used in context, it has to do with the behavior of a member of the<br>
group.  The sticking point is not the particular behavior, but how to<br>
react to it.  In this area of life, my skills have been compromised.<br>
<p>
Face it, the first experience any of us ever have with the subject of<br>
judgment is what we receive at the hands of our parents.  In the case of<br>
my dad, it was always an instinctive reaction: he'd freak out, yell,<br>
smack us or get his belt -- a wide, black leather number.  The older we<br>
got the less crudely physical he got; intimidation alone was enough to<br>
keep me and my two brothers in line.<br>
<p>
[Disclaimer: I converted to Adventism in my teen years after my folks<br>
were divorced and my dad was out of the picture.  We had no formal<br>
religious upbringing when I was a child, and whenever my dad used the<br>
name of God when I was growing up he appended it with terms that would<br>
get me thrown off this BBS].<br>
<p>
I used to think that, once my folks got divorced and my dad was out of<br>
the house, I could get on with my life.  I know better now.  One of the<br>
lasting scars for me has been a problem with the subject of judgment.<br>
In fact I found the SDA belief in instantaneous non-existence (rather<br>
than perpetual torment) for someone who comes out on the wrong side of<br>
the judgment of God to be something of a comfort.<br>
<p>
But back to judgment.  I find myself unable to get into the topic of<br>
someone else's sin.  I'm comfortable with the notion that "if you know<br>
something's wrong and you do it anyway, it's sin" (to paraphrase, I<br>
believe, James).  I have more trouble condemning someone else's behavior.<br>
Not because I'm such a generous and liberal guy, but because I<br>
instinctively can't bring myself to sit in judgment of another human<br>
being the way my dad sat in judgment on me.  And that model of behavior<br>
was so burned into my circuit boards that it takes a real effort to<br>
learn alternative ways of acting.<br>
<p>
And so I had to find a safety net.  I developed the habit of judging<br>
people's ideas and philosophies rather than their actions.  It was a way<br>
I could get it out of my system in displaced and dispassionate forums:<br>
Letters to the Editor columns, radio call-in shows, even this BBS.<br>
There's that emotional distance between people that makes me feel more<br>
comfortable.  God forbid I should confront anyone face to face, even<br>
with open sin!<br>
<p>
But that's just me.  <br>

I sat on this for several days...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am really surprised about the discussion of Guns and SDA,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and have been telling myself reading the posts "the americans</i><br>
<i>&gt; are crazy..". </i><br>
<p>
Yeah, probably.<br>
<p>
Along with eveyone else on earth since sin entered, I fear. :{<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think that those who have weapons in their house  for protecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves (I think this will exlude hunting) are about to break </i><br>
<i>&gt; the sixth commandment - in my Bible there are no exclusions in that </i><br>
<i>&gt; commandment.</i><br>
<p>
The Hebrew translates to "murder" in english, not "kill".  There is<br>
*some* difference in meaning.<br>
<p>
Note also: Exodus 22:1,2; Luke 22:35,36; Esther 8, 9 and 10 (I was <br>
more than somewhat startled to read this last one after a *long* time <br>
of neglecting it for other parts.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think one more, still more important reason for not having weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that when you kill a person - for any reason - you place yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the place of God - who only is the Lord of the living and dead. </i><br>
<p>
I will have to think about this point again...but I'm initially inclined<br>
to disagree, at least partially: the majority of non-disease deaths in<br>
this country, at least, are accomplished through automobile accidents.<br>
I don't see how the statement above fits such a situation.<br>
<p>
The point of self-defense (the which I believe to be defensible) is<br>
to *stop* the attacker, not to kill him.  The problem is that<br>
*effective* methods of stopping are very often potentially-lethal,<br>
and non-lethal tools are too often ineffective.<br>
<p>
Still, a decision that should be left up to the individual's <br>
conscience.<br>

Maybe Steve et al are right about this discipline/judgment thing, but if so<br>
I hope I'm never involved in it. Ostracism is a terrible thing, and it can<br>
be seen every day at any primary or high school in the world. Then there are<br>
those who continue to be ostracised on into adulthood, whether it's because of<br>
race, gender/career combination, religion, appearance or whatever. There's<br>
enough loneliness and rejection in the world already without us adding to it,<br>
for whatever good reason.<br>
<p>
So I guess I must be a wimp. Well I knew that anyway. I'll allow others to<br>
take the lead when it comes to public condemnation and ostracism.<br>

<i>&gt; From: Steven Timm &lt;st0o+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am deeply disturbed by the tone of conversation of the pro-gun forces</i><br>
<i>&gt; on SDAnet.  </i><br>
<p>
Careful, it's not a monolithic statement, and several issues have<br>
been addressed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is merely another reflection of the militarism that is </i><br>
<i>&gt; overtaking our church, and perhaps an effect of twenty years of non-stop</i><br>
<i>&gt; TV violence.</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When I was a kid, they pointed to Desmond Doss as an SDA hero.</i><br>
<p>
Still do (at least around here, and at my home). Also Keith Argraves<br>
(a WW2 non-combatant paratrooper, if you can imagine such a thing), and<br>
fellows like my father who served non-combatant who were never decorated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; He worked</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the face of war to save the lives of others, refusing to touch a gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; himself.  For saving 75 lives in Okinawa during the 2nd World War, he won</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Congressional Medal of Honor.</i><br>
<p>
No. He was awarded the Medal of Honor. No Congressional about it.<br>
(Sorry, I'm a compulsive tech writer.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The youth I teach now get to read about Ronald Tull, an SDA who went</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the Persian Gulf during Desert Storm to shoot.  It was clear editorially</i><br>
<i>&gt; where the SDA publications stood:  Saddam was EVIL, the USA was RIGHT,</i><br>
<i>&gt; let's go bomb Iraq (notwithstanding SDA believers right in the thick of</i><br>
<i>&gt; bombs).  Ronald Tull "The first SDA casualty of the war" was put forth</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a hero.</i><br>
<p>
It didn't come across (to me) as one who was a hero for volunteering to<br>
fight, but one who was doing some admirable things in spite of being in<br>
service in an active cambat arm.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As sickening as I find that attitude, I find the current attitude expressed</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the various proponents of guns even more distressing.  Nothing said</i><br>
<i>&gt; about whether it is moral or not to have a weapon of lethal force.</i><br>
<p>
*I* thought that the discussion was specifically on that point (at least<br>
the self-defense parts of the thread.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nothing said about whether Christians ought to be learning to use a weapon</i><br>
<i>&gt; of force against fellow man.</i><br>
<p>
??? "Does scripture permit it?" and "under what circumstances?" don't<br>
apply?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Only political arguments "got to defend ourselves against the government."</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, but it's probably true.  At best, we have to live in a cautious<br>
alliance with governments. A government should have a bit of healthy<br>
caution about its citizens, should it cross the line to oppressing them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; These are the attitude that turn SDA doctrine-spouters into David Koreshes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It sounds like Koresh would be a hero to some of you.</i><br>
<p>
Fortunately, I have yet to speak to anyone (much less any SDA) who saw<br>
Koresh as a hero.  A *lot* of people, though, who believed that the <br>
government actions in Waco were wrong, ill-advised, illegal and worse.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Does the idea of self-defense have any Biblical support?  It does have some,</i><br>
<i>&gt; particularly in the book of Esther.  But nobody has mentioned that.</i><br>
<p>
I thought that some of my previous posts on the topic mentioned some<br>
other support (just re-read the last part of Esther yesterday), such<br>
as Exodus 22:1,2 and Luke 22:36,36.<br>
<p>
I believe that there is a separation between the use of offensive and<br>
defensive force.<br>
<p>
I wouldn't (and didn't) volunteer for military service (but would have<br>
gone, like my father) if drafted. Training for combat looks to me very<br>
like preparing to project offensive force.<br>
<p>
 From my reading of scripture, defensive force is something else entirely,<br>
but a tool to be used with extreme caution, like fire.<br>
<p>
Defense against criminal attack I have no problem with, but defense against<br>
government action against me, say for my religious practice, for me would<br>
go over the line.  Maybe it's an arbitrary line, it's the one I currently<br>
hold.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If we want to deal with the issues of self defense or killing in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; name of God, then let's continue.</i><br>
<p>
I hope you don't mean self-defense *as* "killing in the name of God". <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But SDAnet is not the place to rehash political hubris that is peculiar</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the USA.  I'm not interested in what the constitution says, I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested in what God says.</i><br>
<p>
So no more discussions involving the First Amendment?<br>
<p>
I don't think we can always keep things so neatly-compartmented, Steve.<br>
<p>
Governments and politics have a nasty tendency to intrude on our private<br>
lives.<br>
<p>
But if that's what you mean, OK.<br>

First question only, on Ananais and Saphira:  Is it possible that<br>
being psycologically conditioned to instantaneous divine judgment<br>
that when Peter pronounced them judged they simply "died of<br>
fright" [or of the expectation]?  <br>

Looking over my message I see I used the word judge where I meant punish. <br>
Sorry for the error.  We cannot punish sin.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I fail to understand how someone can read 1st Corinthians 4 through 6 and</i><br>
<i>&gt; still say that the church is not supposed to judge.  There are warnings</i><br>
<i>&gt; in 1 Corinthians 4 against premature judging, that's for sure.  But</i><br>

David,<br>
<p>
	The SDA church holds 27 fundamental beliefs.  Among them are the<br>
	1.	The Holy Scriptures, OLD and NEW are the written word of<br>
		God, and the only rule of faith.  (Sola Scriptura)<br>
<p>
	2.	There is one God:  Father Son and Holy Spirit. (The trinity)<br>
	3.	God is the creator, sustainer, source and sovereign of all<br>
		of creation.<br>
<p>
	4.	God the eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ, who<br>
		died for all mankinds' sin, and gave us a perfect example to<br>
		follow.<br>
<p>
	5.	God the eternal Spirit  was active with the father and Son<br>
		in the Creation, incarnation and redemption.<br>
<p>
	6.	God created the world in 6 literal days.  The Holy Scripture<br>
		gives a full account of His creative activity.<br>
<p>
	7.	Man and woman were made in the image of God, with individual<br>
		ity, power and freedom to think and to do.<br>
<p>
	8.	All humanity is involved in a great controversy between Christ<br>
		and satan regarding the character of God, his law and His<br>
		sovereignty over the universe.<br>
<p>
	9.	In Christ's life of perfect obedience to God's will, His<br>
		suffering, death and resurrection, God provided the only<br>
<p>
		means of atonement for human sin, so that those who by<br>
		faith accept this atonement may have eternal life, and the<br>
		whole creation may better understand the infinite love of the<br>
		Creator.<br>
<p>
These are a summary of the first 9 of the 27 fundamental belifs.  These<br>
are common to most churches.  I will finish the list up later, as I need to<br>
get to work now.<br>
<p>
	Additional points.  We believe that the 10 commandments (decalog) is<br>
still binding on all christians today, including the 4th commandment that<br>
enjoins the keeping of the seventh day (Saturday) as a memorial to Gods<br>
creative ability, and as acknowlegement of his sovereignty.<br>
<p>
	We believe that the dead "know not anything".  That is when you die,<br>
you die.  There will come a resurection when the rightous go to heavan and<br>
a resurection when the wicked will be raised to see Christ glorified, then<br>
will be utterly destroyed.<br>

[Darius says]<br>
<i>&gt; We accept as valid a</i><br>
<i>&gt; marriage between a Seventh-day Adventist and a "non-believer" even though</i><br>
<i>&gt; we will not allow our ministers to conduct the ceremony in an SDA church. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
[and Steve counters]<br>
<i>&gt; [Again, this is a custom that is falling by the boards.  Our pastor has</i><br>
<i>&gt; performed several "mixed marriages" in our SDA church, one SDA, the </i><br>
<i>&gt; other not.  Also it is not uncommon to see SDA pastors go to churches </i><br>
<i>&gt; of other denominations to wed one SDA and one not.  SCT]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Darius seems to be referring to marriages to non-Christians.  Steve,<br>
are these the types of marriages your pastor has sanctioned, or are<br>
you referring to marriages to non-SDA Christians?  If the former,<br>
than shame on him.<br>
<p>
Dan Blake<br>
<p>
[As far as I know it is only marriage of SDA's to some other type of <br>
Christian. SCT]<br>

Re: Church discipline.<br>
<p>
I think church discipline is there toprotect the church not to judge<br>
people. I evil is creeping into the congregation, that is making harm to <br>
the church, then we have to get rid of the evil. One way is chirch discipline<br>
Church discipline i snot there to *punish* "naughy children", who might<br>
have problems with themselves and the world around. For them the church<br>
is there to help and cure through love and patience. But sometimes Satan is using <br>
people to create conflicts and disturbance (my poor english!) in the<br>
congregation. Then we have to swiftly get rid of the evil.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; So. Steve, these two people are still under church discipline</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and they are very regular and punctual in church also!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Bill Oblitey</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, where is the church discipline?  How can they still attend</i><br>
<i>&gt;church?  In Matthew 18:17, Jesus says to treat them as one would</i><br>
<i>&gt;a pagan or a tax collector.  In I Corinthians 5:11-13, Paul</i><br>
<i>&gt;instructs us not to associate with them, not to eat with them,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but to expell them from among us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dan</i><br>
<p>
Perhaps this is an instance of hating the sin but loving the sinner.  The<br>
church did not sanction what the brother and sister did.  The church took<br>
action.  I was vocal in all that was done.  I now see the brother and sister as<br>
outsiders who choose to come to our church.  Why should we turn them out?<br>
<p>
As a matter of fact, this is a key feature of the on-going debate in the church<br>
as to whether they should be baptised of not.<br>
<p>
Supposing that these people (the disfellowshiped ones) move to your vicinity<br>
and attended your church.  Would you kick them out?  Suppose now that you tell<br>
me that there's a couple attending your church and I relate their background to<br>
you.  Now, would you kich them out?<br>
<p>
If they go to another SDA church and request baptism, wouldn't the pastor<br>
baptise them?  Is the pastor requested to pry into someone's past before<br>
baptising the person?  We go into prisons to baptise people, so why treat<br>
others differently.<br>
<p>
Now, why wouldn't they be baptised in our church?  We do not feel they they are<br>
sorry for their sin.  If we baptise them, then we are encouraging what they<br>
did.  We will be sending the message that anyone can get between a wife and<br>
husband, request disfellowship, marry in court, and come back to be rebaptised.<br>
<p>
We love them.  They have done wrong.  We have not forgotten it.<br>
This brings up that side of the argument which raises the issue of forgiveness<br>
and I'm not touching that.  All I say about that is that it encourages the<br>
situation where I step over you to get what I want and then turn around to<br>
blame you when you complain that you rather have the problem - you have not<br>
learned to forgive.  You mention the previous time I did the same thing to you<br>
and I remind you that you have not forgotten.<br>
<p>
If we are all sinners and sinner are welcome in our churches, provided they are<br>
making efforts to hold on to Christ, why should we not have these brethren in<br>
church?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; [Jesus] saw all people as children of God.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Would anyone care to defend it in the light of John 1:12.</i><br>
<p>
{other verses:  Rom 8:14, Gal 4:7, Phi 2:15, 1 Jn 3:1,2}<br>
<p>
Yes, the statement does appear to be convey the bland flavor of "all are<br>
children so all will inherit the kingdom".  If that's the meaning, I don't<br>
think that's supportable.  If the statement was modified to read:<br>
  "saw all people as potential children of God if they would just ...", or<br>
  "saw those who believed on Him as ..."<br>
the statement would be Scripturally sound, I reckon.<br>
<p>
An alternate meaning for children of God in the writer's minds might be<br>
"descendants of God's creation (Adam)".  Perhaps they were struggling<br>
with expressing how Jesus felt towards people.  I note the word "compassion"<br>
occurs 14 or so times in the (KJV) gospels in this regard.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; How about:  God loves you enough to accept you just the way you are,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and too much to let you stay that way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Neither is your phrase or its equivalent to be found in the Bible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What you do find is:</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Jn 3:3 .. Jn 3:16 .. Jn 5:14 .. Rom 5:8</i><br>
<p>
If we understand "accept" to mean "accept into God's kingdom, regardless",<br>
that would make repentance and reformation unnecessary, and that would<br>
be un-Scriptural.  I believe that is Dan's point.  If we understand "accept"<br>
to mean "willing to help", that would apply universally.  I note that a<br>
person must want to be helped by God (be repentant, be sorry) for the<br>
relationship to be mutual, for God will not force; but clearly He wants to<br>
help us (Rom 5:8, above; Jer 31:3).<br>
<p>
Expanding further,<br>
    JOH 6:37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that<br>
    cometh to me I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT.<br>
And who does the Father want to save (remembering that the Father and Son<br>
are one in this regard)?<br>
    PE2 3:9 [The Lord is] longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any<br>
    should perish, but that all should come to repentance.<br>
I note that repentance is a gift:<br>
    ACT 5:31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a<br>
    Saviour, for to GIVE REPENTANCE to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.<br>
    (note also Rom 2:4, 2 Cor 7:9,10, 2 Tim 2:25, Heb 6:6)<br>
The Father knows that most will not heed His calls, despising His provision:<br>
    MAT 7:14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth<br>
    unto life, and few there be that find it.<br>
    MAT 22:14 For many are called, but few are chosen.<br>
He pleads with us not to harden our hearts (Heb 3:8,15, 4:7, Ps 95:8):<br>
    To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.<br>

Here's a hypothesis for you all to ponder. This is something I have referred<br>
to a couple of times, but this particular post was prompted by someone's<br>
reference to "truth for our time" a few days back.<br>
<p>
This is _only a hypothesis_, so no artillery please! Disagreement is welcome<br>
as long as it's friendly! Here goes...<br>
<p>
God's communications to mankind through his servants the prophets are almost<br>
always contemporary. Even in instances where inspired writings are clearly<br>
"prophetic" in the popular sense, the message is often a contemporary one as<br>
well as being predictive. If we define a prophet as an individual who is<br>
chosen by God and acts as a medium of communication between God and mankind,<br>
then we could say that a prophet is usually sent to his or her contemporaries.<br>
<p>
This applies to all true prophets throughout the ages. Which people<br>
each of us would include in our list of true prophets is a separate issue,<br>
although related. For the purposes of discussion, let us assume that the list<br>
of true prophets includes all the Bible writers along with Ellen White, whilst<br>
other modern prophets such as Joseph Smith and Mary Baker Eddy are not<br>
included. Most SDAs would agree that this would constitute a subset of the<br>
true prophets of God throughout history (!).<br>
<p>
Now God being God, and people being people, everlasting principles of truth<br>
are contained within inspired writings, even those writings which are<br>
obviously contemporary. Hence we benefit in the twentieth century from<br>
writings which date back thousands of years, and which were addressed to<br>
groups of people significantly different to ourselves. Also, many diverse<br>
groups throughout the world today can make this claim.<br>
<p>
Some people claim that the ancient prophets wrote for all time, while modern<br>
prophets write for their own time only. This seems to be an artificial<br>
distinction, __unless there is a significant difference between the <br>
inspiration of an ancient prophet and the inspiration of a modern prophet__.<br>
<p>
Assuming that this is not the case, we must ask the question: what differences,<br>
if any, should there be in hermeneutics when it comes to reading the Bible <br>
and the writings of Ellen White? If the hypothesis I have presented has some<br>
measure of truth, then there are certain practices which need to be addressed<br>
and probably changed. Two which come to mind:<br>
<p>
1... Ignoring the counsels, directives and testimony of Ellen White because<br>
she was presenting truth for her time - which has long since passed - while<br>
paying lip service to the belief that she was a true prophet of God. <br>
<p>
2... Applying the counsels, directives and testimony of Scriptural prophets<br>
directly, as given, with no serious attempt to discover the principles<br>
involved. (This problem is not at all trivial (!), since we all have<br>
different ideas as to what is "case" and what is "code"... take Paul's<br>
words regarding women and the church as an obvious example.)<br>
<p>
3... Applying the counsels, directives and testimony of Ellen White directly,<br>
as given, with no serious attempt to discover the principles involved. <br>
(Again, a minefield, for similar reasons to those given above.)<br>
<p>
I am aware that some Christians do not think that *any* inspired message<br>
needs to be "contextualized", so I would not expect agreement from that<br>
quarter.<br>
<p>
I would, however, like to hear some reactions to these ideas. For those of<br>
you who say, "yes, Ellen White was a prophet, but I like to stick with God's<br>
Word", I ask again: what differences do you see between God's word through<br>
a prophet n centuries ago, and his word through Ellen White 1 century ago?<br>
<p>
There are lots of related questions, but I think I've written enough for<br>
now!<br>

[Tony Dyson writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; .. this discipline/judgment thing ..  when it comes to public condemnation</i><br>
<i>&gt; and ostracism.</i><br>
<p>
I am puzzled why church discipline (generally, but not always, meaning<br>
disfellowship) is construed to mean public condemnation and ostracism<br>
(yes, I know there are people who do it that way).<br>
<p>
Some points:<br>
1)  Disfellowshiping does not perforce preclude one from obtaining<br>
    salvation.  We are not Catholics, so we are not talking excommunication<br>
    here (excommunication prevents you from receiving the sacraments,<br>
    whence, allegedly, God's grace/salvation).  Humans may err in<br>
    judgment, but God does not (Jer 17:10, 1 Sam 16:7b, Ps 9:8, Rev 16:7).<br>
<p>
2)  Disfellowshiping is the last resort after much effort (Gal 6:1) and time.<br>
    Note the extensive probation periods given by God to the Jews<br>
    (e.g., Jer 25:11,12, 29:10; cf Dan 9:24) before sending severe trial.<br>
    Note how He worked to draw them (e.g., Hos 2:14) in the meantime.<br>
<p>
3)  Matt 18:15-17 directs the offended one (!) to seek reconciliation with<br>
    the offender (note parallel to Gen 3; also the plan of salvation).<br>
    If we apply this method to church discipline, we must note that the<br>
    first imperative is to reconcile and restore (cf Gal 6:1; and note<br>
    the required attitude of meekness and humility on the part of those<br>
    making the approach; note also the tie-in of v.2).<br>
<p>
    Going before the church is *not* for public shaming but to ensure a<br>
    fair hearing and righteous judgment (this latter command is repeated<br>
    many, many times in OT, for extra emphasis).  While it takes two or<br>
    three witnesses for a charge to have any weight, it takes just one vote<br>
    to veto (Deu 17:6, 19:5; note application in 2 Cor 12 &amp; 13).<br>
<p>
4)  If someone is disfellowshipped, what does it mean to treat that one<br>
    as a pagan or tax collector (Mt18:17)?  Ostracism?  Shunning (as the<br>
    Amish call it)?  Think!  Did Jesus shun?  Or did Jesus woo?  Probation<br>
    has not yet closed!  Win them anew! (2 Cor 5:18-20, Col 1:20-23, Jer 31:3)<br>
<p>
5)  The judgment we are told not to make is that which involves someone's<br>
    eternal destiny, particularly their condemnation.  In the courts,<br>
    a judge sentences, or condemns, one to a specific punishment.<br>
    We are not to judge whether someone is worthy of eternal life or<br>
    eternal death.  However, church discipline is something quite distinct.<br>
<p>
    If we see church discipline as punishment to hurt or shame someone,<br>
    as if it were some kind of catharsis for the "saints", we do not<br>
    understand the purposes of discipline. {Btw, the same could be said<br>
    of child discipline).<br>
<p>
    The purpose of church discipline is to (re)teach the one under<br>
    discipline how to be a true disciple of Christ.<br>
    <br>
    Before we can teach effectively, I submit we must first understand and<br>
    live the disciplines of the Christian life ourselves, we must know how<br>
    to be a true &amp; loyal disciple of Christ.<br>
<p>
6)  It is worth my while and yours to study into what sort of church<br>
    discipline God has ordained.  For example, in Christ's Object Lessons,<br>
    re the wheat and the tares, EGW indicates that persisting in open sin<br>
    is a valid basis for disfellowshiping.  The operative words are<br>
    "persisting" (see my comments above re probation, note the many refs<br>
    to God as long suffering) and "open".  Speculation re hidden sin is<br>
    called evil surmising.  Seeking out "tares" to pick on is<br>
    countermanded (Mt 7:3-5) and counterproductive (Mt 13:29).<br>
<p>
    God's Word is full of balances:  justice vs mercy, authority vs<br>
    appeal, etc.  Godly church discipline also has balance.<br>

I'm finally catching up on some "old" e-mail.  Steve, some time ago you<br>
mentioned that there was something about being inside the Capital<br>
Beltway that makes people forget.  Having driven the Beltway many times,<br>
I can assure you that the GC in Silver Spring is outside the Beltway<br>
(although Takoma Park was inside).  An increasing number of government<br>
offices are also outside the Beltway.  An item of information, just to<br>
keep the record straight!<br>

Randall A Helzerman says:<br>
-------------------------<br>
<i>&gt;There is entirely too much trust of governments among SDAs.  Its been</i><br>
<i>&gt;fortold that the U.S. would speak like a dragon.  </i><br>
<p>
I agree, SDAs should pay more attention to prophecy, especially these days.<br>
Some don't seem to believe it, but bible prophecy has never failed, no matter<br>
how unlikely it seemed at the time they were given.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Radical statement:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Americans need guns to protect themselves against their own government.</i><br>
<p>
The notion of fighting the government with guns.... sounds to me like a<br>
revolution or something. I can't imagine Jesus using a gun to defend<br>
Himself against the oppressive Roman government, which didn't even claim<br>
to be a democracy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We all would be well advised to consider the kind of government we have.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It kills people, and then fakes evidence to cover its tracks.  Moreover,</i><br>
<i>&gt;not even the courts will allow the jurors to hear all the facts of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;case.</i><br>
<p>
Practically all governments do that. Not just yours.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Such a government will not hesitate to impose a Sunday law as soon as</i><br>
<i>&gt;the angels stop holding back the winds of strife!</i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, evil people can commit all kinds of mayhem with weapons.  But you</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't seriously think that the government is composed of all angels do</i><br>
<i>&gt;you?</i><br>
<p>
Of course they aren't all angels, but does that mean we as Christians have<br>
to take up arms to defend against them? Jesus and Paul lived under even<br>
worse governments than yours or mine, and they never advocated resisting<br>
them with weapons. In fact, we are admonished to obey the authorities and<br>
not to fight back. Daniel &amp; Co. were even captured and sent into exile, and<br>
faced persecuitions, but God protected them, they also obeyed the king as<br>
far as they could, not fearing his wrath when they refused to bow to the<br>
idol. What does their example say to us?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Why should they get all the guns?</i><br>
<p>
They don't wear a sword for nothing:<br>
<p>
Rom 13:1-5 1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is<br>
no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. 2 Whosoever<br>
therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that<br>
resist shall receive to themselves damnation. 3 For rulers are not a terror<br>
to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do<br>
that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: 4 For he is the<br>
minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be<br>
afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God,<br>
a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. 5 Wherefore ye must<br>
needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Steven Tim says:<br>
----------------<br>
<i>&gt;As a lifelong flatlander, I've often wondered how I would get out to </i><br>
<i>&gt;any sort of mountain when the persecution started.  Besides this, to track</i><br>
<i>&gt;me down electronically would be trivial.  I suspect a hand will just come</i><br>
<i>&gt;out of the terminal, slap on the handcuffs, and that will be it.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, its even worse here, my whole country is a big city on an island 41km<br>
wide and 23km from North to South, there's nowhere to flee to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do those of you who say that guns are needed to protect us in America from</i><br>
<i>&gt;our own government intend to take up arms whenever the death-decree folks</i><br>
<i>&gt;come after you?  Do you think it will do any good to shoot a few of them?</i><br>
<i>&gt;And if you don't think you would do it in the ultimate situation, why</i><br>
<i>&gt;in any other situation?</i><br>
<p>
In the bible, doesn't Jesus say to leave everything and flee, and not to make<br>
any provisions for that time? We are not to be like survivalists and hide in<br>
bunkers to fight them off with guns.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;in gun control, too, so guns would not be available to do the job the</i><br>
<i>&gt;constitution could not.I think that at the time of the end the only thing</i><br>
<p>
Guns do the job of the constitution? How??????  Hmmm.. the bullet or the<br>
ballot. Is it better to bite the bullet or bet on the ballot...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;we will be able to trust to protect us from our government is the power</i><br>
<i>&gt;of God,  and that is no less true now than it will be then.</i><br>
<p>
It has always been so, we can see the examples in the bible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When I was a kid, they pointed to Desmond Doss as an SDA hero.  He worked</i><br>
<p>
Same here, PFC Desmond Doss's conduct was examplary.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The youth I teach now get to read about Ronald Tull, an SDA who went to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Persian Gulf during Desert Storm to shoot.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. i read his story in Signs magazine. He got hit by "friendly fire" from<br>
an A-10 warthog. If i was an SDA non-combattent conscript in the Iraqi army<br>
and he came along in his tank and blasted me to bits, that would be "friendly<br>
fire" too. And if i wasn't a Christian, well, like SDA Vietnam vetran Oscar<br>
Mathison said: "If a man is bad and i kill him, he might go to hell. If he<br>
lives he might change and become better. I cannot be responsible for his<br>
destiny."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It was clear editorially where the SDA publications stood:  Saddam was EVIL,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the USA was RIGHT, let's go bomb Iraq (notwithstanding SDA believers right</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the thick of bombs).</i><br>
<p>
Not to mention all the non-SDAs who will now never be SDAs. Something like<br>
eighty to a hundred thousand souls were killed in Iraq, and many more are<br>
maimed and mutilated, and we are so worked up over eighty-odd Branch<br>
Davidians killed at Waco.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;SDA doctrine-spouters into David Koreshes.  It sounds like Koresh would </i><br>
<i>&gt;be a hero to some of you.  He "stood up against the tyrannical development,</i><br>
<i>&gt;was ready to defend his family, etc. etc.".  God help us, what are we coming</i><br>
<i>&gt;to?</i><br>
<p>
The end of the world Steve, that's what.<br>
<p>
Andrew Park says:<br>
-----------------<br>
<i>&gt;I too read that story.  But when I read it was more about </i><br>
<i>&gt;christian life style (I mean reading Bible, not killing people),</i><br>
<i>&gt;love of fellow soldier(American soldires :) ), home sick etc.  It </i><br>
<i>&gt;was about a story of  a man, not a Rambo.  It was a human story</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather than violence story.</i><br>
<p>
When i read it, i didn't occur to me that Ronald Tull was an SDA, Signs of<br>
the Times didn't say so. I thought it was just a story about some Christian<br>
serving in the Gulf, and how God preserved His life, about his faith and<br>
forgiving spirit etc.<br>
<p>
Steve Hix says to Steve Timm:<br>
-----------------------------<br>
SCT&gt; Do you think it will do any good to shoot a few of them?<br>
SCT&gt; And if you don't think you would do it in the ultimate situation, why<br>
SCT&gt; in any other situation?<br>
SH&gt;By this argument one should not resist criminal attacks such as rape or<br>
SH&gt;assaults on children.<br>
<p>
Luke 8:25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid<br>
wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he<br>
commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Matt 5:38-45 38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and<br>
a tooth for a tooth: 39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but<br>
whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40<br>
And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have<br>
thy cloke also. 41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him<br>
twain. 42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of<br>
thee turn not thou away. 43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt<br>
love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 44 But I say unto you, Love your<br>
enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray<br>
for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 45 That ye may be the<br>
children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on<br>
the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.<br>
<p>
Lk 6:27-30 27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to<br>
them which hate you, 28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which<br>
despitefully use you. 29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek<br>
offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take<br>
thy coat also. 30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that<br>
taketh away thy goods ask them not again. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Luke 6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing<br>
again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the<br>
Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. (KJV)<br>
<p>
1 Th 5:15 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow<br>
that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. (KJV) <br>
<p>
Rom 12:19-20 19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place<br>
unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the<br>
Lord. 20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him<br>
drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. (KJV) <br>
<p>
SCT&gt; As long as we have the constitution to protect us from our own<br>
SCT&gt; government, we are fine.<br>
SH&gt; ...The constitutional guarantees did slave in the U.S. no good for a long<br>
SH&gt; time.<br>
<p>
So, if the constitution didn't protect you you'd take up weapons to fight it<br>
out with the government eh?  Jesus lived under enemy occupation,with no<br>
constitution or rights, yet He didn't fight Caesar.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Who was it who said "put not your trust in princes"? (The concordance in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Bible here at work is *really* pitiful...) It's more true now than it</i><br>
<i>&gt;was then, if for no other reason than current "princes" can do more damage</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the ancients could.</i><br>
<p>
At least your "princes" don't feed you to lions for entertainment. So, if we<br>
don't trust princes, who do we trust, our guns i suppose?<br>
<p>
Ps 146:3-7 3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom<br>
there is no help. 4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in<br>
that very day his thoughts perish. 5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob<br>
for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God: 6 Which made heaven, and<br>
earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever: 7<br>
Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry.<br>
The LORD looseth the prisoners: ...etc(KJV) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(And if you were to look at countries who currently ban civilian ownership</i><br>
<i>&gt;of firearms, you'll find none that are completely-successful at it. In all</i><br>
<i>&gt;cases, criminals still have access to, and use, firearms.)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, thats true, look at my country, (its a metropolis of population about<br>
2.5 million), the whole of this year so far, i think there have been as many<br>
as 2 incidents of people getting shot at with guns!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The main notion of the Second amendment was to provide one more check on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the power of the State.  Also note that a militia could be called up for</i><br>
<i>&gt;more than just defense against foreign invasion; the first police</i><br>
<i>&gt;departments were set up with unarmed policemen who were to call out armed</i><br>
<i>&gt;citizens at need to deal with criminals, both individuals and groups.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, note that Ellen White says of the US that the government will eventually<br>
remove protection from Sabbath keepers and let their enemies kill them<br>
freely. So, it appears that it is the private gun owning citizens who will do<br>
most of the SDA hunting with guns. She also says that angels of God in the<br>
form of men of war will help protect us, so i don't think God wants us to<br>
fight with guns.<br>
<p>
SCT&gt; I think that at the time of the end the only thing we will be able to<br>
SCT&gt; trust to protect us from our government is the power of God,  and that<br>
SCT&gt; is no less true now than it will be then.<br>
SH&gt;Perhaps we should depend on prayer alone to deal with disease and injury.<br>
<p>
Of course, we must do what we can to avert danger, but to kill people, that<br>
is going too far. The ends does _not_ justify the means. To tell you the<br>
truth, if i was put in a situation where someone was going to kill me or my<br>
family and i had a gun to shoot back, i don't know for sure what i would do,<br>
but i still think that in principle at least, it is wrong to kill others for<br>
any reason at all, unless God tells us to do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Even Jesus gave his disciples leave to arm themselves for self-defense...and</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is equally clear that irresponsible use of them was not part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;package.</i><br>
<p>
If Jesus told them to go around armed, why is there no record of any of the<br>
disciples going around armed, or using weapons in Acts, like Paul, who<br>
frequently faced openly hostile, persecuitive people?<br>
<p>
Matt 16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will<br>
lose his life for my sake shall find it. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Matt 26:52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place:<br>
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Paul et al were even stoned etc but God protected them; I think i remember<br>
that the reformer Martin Luther once met a man who brougt a pistol to kill<br>
him. The man asked him why he wasn't afraid, and he said that his life was in<br>
the hands of God, or something to that effect, so why should he be, and the<br>
man ran away.<br>
<p>
David Plaisted says:<br>
--------------------<br>
<i>&gt;I was disturbed at one vespers to promote non violence and non use of guns</i><br>
<i>&gt;and to have many leading members of my own church oppose me.</i><br>
<p>
Why ever would they do that? Are they supporters of violence and using guns?<br>
Is it true that in parts of the USA, even school kids use guns? It might be<br>
some sort of cultural thing in America, but i think there's too much<br>
violence, and too many guns there. Is it worth it when so many people get<br>
shot each year? Human lives are precious, Jesus died for people, whoever they<br>
are. We know the truth, we know that we are saved. If people kill us, we have<br>
nothing to worry about.<br>
<p>
May all of you have a good week ahead, and may God protect you.<br>

It is with some trepidation that I re-open this subject, but it's Friday<br>
afternoon and I'm tired of working (being an SDA institution, everyone<br>
else has long since left).  I've been thinking about several statements<br>
and unanswered questions that have arisen in the last month or so.  Let<br>
me take a stab at some of them (this may be somewhat disjointed).<br>
<p>
First, I think our biases are largely based on our personal past<br>
history.  My own views of homosexuality have changed by knowing a number<br>
of gay men and lesbians.  One of these was my own cousin, who never<br>
"came out" to his family and who died of AIDS several years ago.  I'm<br>
not quite sure what is meant when people use the term "homosexual<br>
lifestyle" because the gays and lesbians I know seem to have a wide<br>
divergence is their lifestyle.  One thing they do seem to have in common<br>
is a great deal of empathy for each other.  I do not believe most people<br>
would "choose" a position in society with so many difficulties unless<br>
there was a pretty powerful impetus.  What that is, no one seems to know<br>
for sure.  It is true that some gays and lesbians (probably a higher<br>
percentage of gay men than lesbians) choose to be hedonistic and have<br>
multiple sex partners (perhaps as exemplified by gay bars and the wilder<br>
aspects of a Gay Pride parades, you know--the kind of thing that gets on<br>
the news, for example, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence).  However,<br>
many gays and lesbians are "turned off" by such antics.  Somehow the<br>
public seems to believe this is the way "they" all live just because it<br>
makes better "copy."<br>
<p>
The people I know are either in a long-term committed relationship or<br>
desire one.  However, our society is not set up to support this as it is<br>
for heterosexuals.  Why else would gays and lesbians want to get<br>
married?  There seems to be in inborn need for stability and commitment.<br>
It's dangerous to generalize, but it seems that this desire is stronger<br>
in women than in men, and this appears to be true of lesbians.  Gay men,<br>
like their heterosexual brothers, seem to have a greater temptation for<br>
"conquest."  <br>
<p>
Steve, I expect you know more gays and lesbians than you think.  There<br>
is no way to know for certain how many there are in society, but if all<br>
gays and lesbians were green for a day, we would probably all be<br>
surprised at how many there are and who they are.  It is, of course,<br>
complicated by the fact that gender orientation does not appear to be<br>
100% one way or the other, or even necessarily to stay the same<br>
throughout life.  Psychosexual behavior is indeed a mysterious thing.<br>
When I was in college, I was naive and often didn't recognize what was<br>
going on about me.  Quite a number of the people I knew then, I now know<br>
were and are gay.  There are probably others as well.  Gays and lesbians<br>
often don't "come out" in a hostile environment (for obvious reasons)<br>
and to those who they think will be unfriendly.  I shouldn't be<br>
surprised that a number of people at your place of employement are gay<br>
or lesbian.<br>
<p>
It would be interesting to know how the student affairs offices of the<br>
SDA colleges deal with gay and lesbian students.  I expect there are<br>
significant differences between institutions and over time.  I do not<br>
believe Andrews University is particularly supportive of gays and<br>
lesbians.  However, I understand that there are gay students at other<br>
SDA colleges who are "out."<br>
<p>
Marcus asked for SDA literature that would be supportive and<br>
non-judgmental for a gay person.  I'm not sure what he was asking for.<br>
While the church no doubt does publish spiritually uplifting materials<br>
(is that what you wanted?), I do not think it publishes anything that<br>
would be particularly supportive for an Adventist homosexual (for that,<br>
you would have to go to SDA Kinship).  It seems the church feels more<br>
called to judgment than to personal support (just read the archives of<br>
this list).<br>
<p>
Len Archer stated that all truth is contextual.  I'm waiting to see if<br>
there's any response.  I tend to agree with him.  It seems that we often<br>
have a desire for "absolute" truth (context-independent) as a standard<br>
for behavior.  The older I get, the more questions I have and the more<br>
abiguities I see.  Of course, materials written in other times and<br>
cultures (including the Bible and Ellen White) have to take into account<br>
their context, to the best we can understand it.  The Bible contains<br>
enough information for salvation for even the illiterate.  There is a<br>
tendency in Adventism (and probably Christianity generally) to<br>
understand the unknowable--for example, David Koresh's obsession with<br>
the 7 seals or the early Adventists' belief that they knew when Christ<br>
would come).  In the end, it's not important.  I tease my colleages in<br>
the seminary by calling the study of theology "idle speculation."<br>
People tend to pick and choose what parts of the Bible they accept as<br>
relevanat today and reject those that don't.  For me, I see pretty much<br>
all of Leviticus as part of an ancient culture, including the statements<br>
on unclean meats.  I don't choose to eat them (or much other meat)<br>
because of health principles not because of Leviticus (I sometimes<br>
wonder what lobster tastes like, though!).<br>
<p>
I believe the thread originally got started over female homosexuality<br>
(lesbianism).  It certainly existed in the classical world (after all,<br>
the island of Lesbos is in Greece) and probably the ancient world as<br>
well.  There are probably a number of reasons why it doesn't merit<br>
biblical attention.  First, the Bible is largely a male book.  Women<br>
were marginalized in those societies.  But I think there may also be<br>
something else at work.  Even today, I think male homosexuality seems to<br>
be more of a "threat" to society than lesbianism.  Is it because<br>
lesbians are fewer in number?  Tend to have more committed<br>
relationships?  Or does it have to do with a perhaps unspoken definition<br>
of intercourse?  Is a sexual relationship the same as having<br>
intercourse, and does intercourse require at least one party having a<br>
penis?  "Boston marriages" (2 women living together) have been around<br>
for years, including in the Adventist community.  People might look a<br>
little funny, but it's not the same as 2 men living together.  Perhaps<br>
the underlying belief is "What could they possibly be doing together?"<br>
It's none of my business, and I don't care to know.  Probably nothing.<br>
What level of intimacy is required for it to be a "sexual relationship"?<br>
Kissing, handholding, and other forms of intimacy appear, even among<br>
members of the same gender, appear to have been socially acceptable in<br>
ancient cultures, and is still true in some non-Western cultures.  In<br>
the West, we seem to have an inborn fear of this kind of intimacy.  I<br>
wonder if repression of this "need" in some who may feel it the most<br>
strongly may be a "cause" for homosexuality (alluded to by Steve<br>
already).<br>
<p>
I have also noticed that men seem to be more threatened by male<br>
homosexuality than women appear to be.  Is it possible that this is a<br>
feeling of "letting down the side"?  Giving up the traditional<br>
patriarchal dominance of women?  <br>
<p>
There are probably many reasons why heterosexuals fear gays and<br>
lesbians.  Most of us tend to fear what we don't know/understand.  There<br>
may be a fear of sexually-transmitted diseases.  There appears to be a<br>
fear that "they" might turn a straight person into a gay one (though<br>
there appears to be little evidence to support this).  Perhaps on a more<br>
personal level, there is a fear of any homoerotic thoughts they<br>
themselves may have had.<br>
<p>
As I stated when I began, I have few answers and many questions.  I hope<br>
this has stimulated some thought.  I'm not out to flame anyone on this<br>
list (and hope the flames don't get too hot!).<br>
<p>
For now--<br>

Someone asked if Dan Blake's post about "where is the discipline"<br>
was facetious.  If we look at church discipline in the light of 1 Corinthians<br>
5, where the man has his father's wife, they say "with such a one no, not<br>
to eat."  It does involve for that particular case excising that person<br>
from the community.  It should be noted that this is a case where <br>
the person continued in his wrong, not one where the person confessed his<br>
sin and asked the congregation for forgiveness.<br>
<p>
I am not prepared to say that this tactic should be applied in every case<br>
(certainly not) or that it should be applied to any case.  But any discussion<br>
of the theology of judging should take 1 Corinthians 4-6 into mind, as <br>
well as 1 Corinthians 13.<br>
<p>
Let's return to the case of Indiana, PA mentioned by Bill.  Many would <br>
agree that this is a flagrant case of adultery which ought to fall <br>
under church discipline.  Now suppose instead that this episode of <br>
adultery had happened before either of them was a church member, and<br>
they come into church for the first time, wanting baptism.  What happens then?<br>

[Steven Timm writes:]  [this wasn't me, it was Woody Baker  SCT]<br>
<i>&gt; David,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	The SDA church holds 27 fundamental beliefs.  Among them are ...</i><br>
<p>
[This is Fred Christiansen]<br>
It is probably worth mentioning that the 27 fundamental beliefs document<br>
was published fairly recently.  I don't recall the rationale, at that time,<br>
for preparing such a document (the Intro gives some indication), but among<br>
objections was that the SDA church has survived, yea prospered, these years<br>
without it, so leave well enough alone; moreover, that there would be a great<br>
temptation to view it as a creed.<br>
<p>
When the decision was made (Dallas? 1985?) to go forward, the creed<br>
                           [Dallas, 1980  SCT]<br>
objection was met by stating (this is also in the Intro) that:<br>
1) The document does not pretend to cover all points of belief.<br>
2) The discussion on a given point of belief is not the be-all and end-all;<br>
   rather, an expression of the common understanding of Scripture.<br>
<p>
If there were a creed, it should be "The Bible and the Bible only".<br>

Please Help!<br>
<p>
I was just nominated on to the Sabbath School committee and have no idea<br>
what I will do.  I now find it very challenging to come up with some<br>
interesting Sabbath School ideas.<br>
If you have any excellent ideas, or even if they are not excellent I would<br>
love to hear from you.<br>
<p>
Thanks;<br>

Thanks to Jerry Wiley I obtained a copy of Walter Rea's book:  "The White <br>
Lie"  On receiving it I discovered that he wrote the foreword to it,<br>
summarizing the book well without saying anything our SDAnet members <br>
would consider "heretical."  I also discovered that Rea's book was published<br>
in 1982, after the confrontation had already happened and he had already <br>
been stripped of his ministerial position.  He writes as a man who has<br>
nothing to lose, afraid of nothing or no one.  It is intriguing to hear<br>
his <br>
claim that he was one of those who gave early warnings to the church officers<br>
about the Davenport financial affair, several years before it happened.<br>
Theology does not occur in a vacuum, and this book tells you almost as <br>
much about the man Walter Rea as it does about his work.  He also proved <br>
to be much older than I had thought.<br>
<p>
He relates how early in his ministry he compiled several volumes of <br>
Ellen White quotations as they related to the Bible.<br>
Walter Rea claims that Ellen White was a creature of her times.  But he<br>
is also a creature of his time.  His book is crafted in the classic style<br>
of the late 40's in which he began his ministry, namely, a polemic with<br>
a lot of EGW quotes to back it up.  It's not designed for the open-minded,<br>
rather it is designed for Whiteholics like himself, first to goad them <br>
into blinding rage, then read his book to try to prove it wrong,<br>
and (the way he has it set up) likely fail to do so and come to the <br>
same rejection he did.<br>
<p>
There is a lot of careful work done in the comparison of Ellen White's <br>
books with other sources.  But tying it together is a web of unsubstantiated<br>
accusations.  The thesis of the book is not only that E.G.White copied,<br>
but that it was done premeditatedly and maliciously, that the idea of<br>
a prophet was promulgated at the beginning of the movement with intent<br>
to deceive, that EGW did not have control over her various copyists,<br>
and that a cover-up has been promulgated to hide these facts.  For most<br>
of these accusations he gives little documentation, and none at all <br>
for the various intent he subscribes.   <br>
<p>
In Michigan and Illinois we are rather far removed from Southern California,<br>
where all this action was.  I was in academy at the time when this book <br>
came out.  It seemed from my remote vantage point that the flap over<br>
Desmond Ford's ideas caused much more stir than Walter Rea's did at the time.<br>
Rea in his book likens himself to a guerilla fighter compared to Ford, the <br>
jousting knight.  Nevertheless we must say that Rea's book, more than <br>
any other, has led to more re-examining of the theology of inspiration <br>
than most other events.  This re-examination still continues today. <br>
<p>
Unfortunately, it's a re-examination that Rea never made.  Ellen G. White<br>
wasn't the kind of prophet he wanted her to be, so he chose to reject<br>
the prophet rather than his idea of a prophet.  It is clear that<br>
his fundamentalist views have not changed, only his interpretation of<br>
whether EGW met them or not.  <br>
<p>
Maybe it's good that I read this book now rather than 11 years ago. <br>
My response might have been different.  Open-minded folks have nothing <br>
to fear from reading this book.  And no one should be afraid of the facts.<br>
<p>

Dennis passed away last night during surgery (due to complications<br>
from his last illness).  There will be a memorial service on Monday<br>
evening, at 7:30 p.m. at the Elmhurst SDA church, 246 W. Butterfield Rd.<br>
in Elmhurst, IL.<br>
<p>
In lieu of flowers, donations are being accepted toward the Elmhurst DSA<br>
(SDA) Church Organ Fund.<br>
<p>
To all of you who have prayed for him over the last weeks, we thank<br>
you again.  All we can do is, as Job said:  "The Lord giveth, and the<br>
Lord taketh away.  Blessed be the name of the Lord."<br>

This is  in reply to Raylene's observation:<br>
<p>
Some of us who grew up in the church, and have been hearing Bible stories<br>
since the Kindergarten, have a distorted picture of the Bible characters.<br>
<p>
David has always been viewed as a great Bible hero, but let's examine his <br>
life, briefly.<br>
<p>
He was an adulterer.<br>
A cold blooded murdered. (Doesn't matter that someone else was the hit man.)<br>
He had a quick temper.<br>
He was a bad father.<br>
He was an exhibitionist. (Dancing naked in the streets.  God loved that.)<br>
<p>
I do not think that there is a whole lot about David that we would admire in<br>
a church or civic leader today.<br>
<p>
David's greatest accomplishments seem to be his prowess and bravery in war.<br>
God loved this man.  David loved God.<br>
<p>
I have always held David up as an excellent example of "God can work with<br>
anyone who is willing."<br>

Your understanding of Walter Rea's book, "The White Lie," is entirely<br>
correct. Like most people with a fundamentalist mind, he did not consider<br>
the possibility that his own understanding was defective. It is always<br>
easier to make negative judgments of someone else than to reexamine one's own<br>
views.<br>

Re: Guns.<br>
<p>
I am not a theologian, but I will try to clarify my point<br>
<p>
---------<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the sixth commandment - in my Bible there are no exclusions in that </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; commandment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Hebrew translates to "murder" in english, not "kill".  There is</i><br>
<i>&gt;*some* difference in meaning.</i><br>
-------<br>
Well I see just juridicial difference - when you buy a gun, is it not <br>
for killing, otherwise a tear gas patron would do.<br>
<p>
--------<br>
<i>&gt;Note also: Exodus 22:1,2; Luke 22:35,36; Esther 8, 9 and 10 (I was </i><br>
<i>&gt;more than somewhat startled to read this last one after a *long* time </i><br>
<i>&gt;of neglecting it for other parts.)</i><br>
---------<br>
Let us look at Luke first:<br>
It was after the last supper - Luke 22:35-38: Then Jesus asked. "When I <br>
sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?"<br>
"Nothing" they answered. <br>
He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag, <br>
and if you don4t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. It is <br>
written: 4And he was numbered with the transgressors4; and I tell you <br>
that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is <br>
reaching its fulfillment.<br>
The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."<br>
"That is enough." he replied.<br>
<p>
The disciples misunderstood Jesus words as we read 12 verses later (Luke <br>
22:51 - But Jesus answered, "No more of this" And he touched the mans <br>
ear and healed him.<br>
 <br>
If I read the text as you do, I have also big difficulties to understand <br>
the sermon on the mount (Matt 5:21):<br>
<p>
You have heard it was said to the people long ago, 4do not murder, and <br>
anyone that murders will be subject to judgment.4 But I tell you that <br>
anyone who is angry with his brother, will be subject to judgment.<br>
<p>
During the persecution that followed in Acts. there is no mention about <br>
casualties. Saul went from house to house dragging people out of the <br>
houses, nobody trying to kill him with any sword.<br>
<p>
The sword mentioned was  more a knife to be used  for cutting bread  <br>
(presumably in the bag).<br>
<p>
Then about the texts in the OT - the text in the sermon on the mount <br>
shows that Jesus did not approve the killing in the OT, and we can leave <br>
them by that instead for a lenghty discussion why God commanded the <br>
Israelites to kill everybody in conquered cities etc.<br>
<p>
------<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I think one more, still more important reason for not having weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is that when you kill a person - for any reason - you place yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in the place of God - who only is the Lord of the living and dead. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I will have to think about this point again...but I'm initially </i><br>
inclined<br>
<i>&gt;to disagree, at least partially: the majority of non-disease deaths in</i><br>
<i>&gt;this country, at least, are accomplished through automobile accidents.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't see how the statement above fits such a situation</i><br>
----<br>
Well to go back to my original point about achieving guns - cars are not <br>
mainly for killing people. If you use them for that you would be <br>
prosecuted - at least in Finland.<br>
--------<br>
<i>&gt;The point of self-defense (the which I believe to be defensible) is</i><br>
<i>&gt;to *stop* the attacker, not to kill him.  The problem is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;*effective* methods of stopping are very often potentially-lethal,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and non-lethal tools are too often ineffective.</i><br>
---------<br>
You got my point! Do not get a gun - you might kill somebody!<br>
---------<br>
<i>&gt;Still, a decision that should be left up to the individual's </i><br>
<i>&gt;conscience.</i><br>
----------<br>
It is *not* on an individual4s conscience. This is not a personal matter <br>
- as eg homosexuality in most of the cases is - by killing or even <br>
injuring an other person you are intruding in his/hers life in a very <br>
drastic way<br>
<p>
God did not order us to use any weapons, instead He said: I will fight <br>
for you. As Christians and especially SDA:s we must stick to that <br>
promise and show our faith in God.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Randall A Helzerman says:</i><br>
<i>&gt; -------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;There is entirely too much trust of governments among SDAs.  Its been</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fortold that the U.S. would speak like a dragon.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree, SDAs should pay more attention to prophecy, especially these days.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some don't seem to believe it, but bible prophecy has never failed, no matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; how unlikely it seemed at the time they were given.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Radical statement:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Americans need guns to protect themselves against their own government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The notion of fighting the government with guns.... sounds to me like a</i><br>
<i>&gt; revolution or something. I can't imagine Jesus using a gun to defend</i><br>
<i>&gt; Himself against the oppressive Roman government, which didn't even claim</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be a democracy.</i><br>
<p>
I'm afraid that I wasn't as clear in statements as I could have been.<br>
Let me try again.<br>
<p>
As I recall, this whole thread was started by somebody asking why<br>
Americans tolerate gun ownership when it results in so many deaths <br>
per year.  I tried to answer the best I could with the following:<br>
<p>
The reason that the right to keep and bear arms was written into the<br>
constitution was because the founding fathers wanted Americans to be<br>
able to violently overthow the government if it became too oppressive.<br>
<p>
This is a historical FACT.  You may not like that fact, but it is a <br>
fact nonetheless.<br>
<p>
BUT WAIT A MINUTE FOLKS!!!  TIME OUT!!! Just because I said a<br>
historical fact doesn't necessarily mean that I agree with it!  <br>
I too cannot imagine Jesus taking up arms against a tyrranical <br>
roman government, and I wouldn't either.<br>
<p>
*Never* in any of my posts did I advocate that *Christians*<br>
should take up arms against the government or anybody else.<br>
Personally, I believe that we should spend most of our time and<br>
efforts prepairing ourselves and our neighbors to be citizens of the<br>
kindom of heaven--and not citizens of the world.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry that my posts made most of you completely aghast.  I must have<br>
appeared to be quite the warmonger, because some of you made the statement<br>
that you couldn't imagine us as being part of the same church, and others<br>
intimated that my hero was the late Branch Davidian pyro cult leader.<br>
All I ask is that you all try and give me the benefit of the doubt, and<br>
in return I'll try to be clearer next time.<br>

It was announced in our Sabbath School yesterday by a member of the<br>
Vyhmeiseter family that Dennis Grumbling, member of this net (and<br>
husband of Heidi Vyhmeister and son-in-law of Werner and Nancy<br>
Vyhmeister) died in surgery in Chicago around 11:30 p.m.  I can only<br>
pass along the details that I have heard second-hand and hope they are<br>
correct.  Apparently there was some sort of complication related to his<br>
heart surgery serveral weeks ago and that he died of an anuerism in the<br>
lower abdomen.  If I hear more, I will pass the information along.  If<br>
someone else on the net knows more, I am sure we would appreciate<br>
knowing about our friend Dennis.  The family has asked that memorials be<br>
made to the organ fund at the Elmhurst, IL, SDA Church.  He will be<br>
buried Tuesday near Elkhart, IN.<br>
<p>
Dennis was a former student employee of the James White Library.  He had<br>
an MDiv degree, I believe, as well as a library degree (and was working<br>
on a doctorate at the University of Chicago).  He was employed in<br>
cataloging/technical services at De Paul University in Chicago, where he<br>
was in charge of the technical details of their online catalong (they<br>
have the same kind we do, and I had been looking forward to doing some<br>
professional kibbutzing with him about it).<br>
<p>
We join his family in mourning the loss of Dennis and look forward to a<br>
better day when we will see him again.<br>

Harvey,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have also noticed that men seem to be more threatened by male</i><br>
<i>&gt;homosexuality than women appear to be.  Is it possible that this is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;feeling of "letting down the side"?  Giving up the traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt;patriarchal dominance of women?  </i><br>
<p>
I've noticed this kind of thing too. <br>
<p>
Perhaps a woman has more to fear in a heterosexual man than a homosexual<br>
one?<br>
<p>
But my theory is that men are afraid of their sexuality - a bit. More, they<br>
are afraid of the terrible excesses that male sexuality can find: abusing<br>
wives, children, rape etc. The time I got the worst reaction out of Tony<br>
was when I told him that I'd met an old friend from school (9 yrs later) that<br>
day and found she had been sexually sexually abused by her father.<br>
<p>
It seems with that kind of thing that many men will prefer to not know and not<br>
have to think about it rather than address the issue. Its easier for me to<br>
just say "isn't that terrible" because I'm not a man....<br>
<p>
It is all very wierd but thats just a few thoughts I'd had.<br>

Hi gang,<br>
<p>
Sorry if this is "off-thread", but I got behind on my e-mail and saw this<br>
comment:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Woody writes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I turned my Tv off 7 years ago, (except for occasional news, such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;elections, the riots in LA, and the Waco thing).  We don't watch anything</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;with violenc in it.</i><br>
<p>
My TV burned up in 1984, wow that was almost 10 years ago.  I never replaced<br>
it.  I've since gotten married, have two kids, and believe it or not, I'm still<br>
alive!.  My wife wondered if we could live with out one.  I said "don't worry"<br>
there's nothing worth watching anyway.  Most people will respond to a phrase<br>
like that with, "well, I only watch PBS."  Yeah, right.  I am of the firm<br>
belief that no one should own one of those boxes.  It has been so long<br>
now, that I don't know what I'd do _with_ one. 8-)  <br>
<p>
My point:  More like a challenge:<br>
<p>
Don't watch it for a day, other than Sabbath, or do you watch it then too, and<br>
see what happens.  You'll have no other choice than to talk to someone.  Perhaps<br>
even to your kids. 8-)  See if you can't get along with out it.  There <br>
really isn't anything redeeming in it.<br>

<i>&gt; I was just nominated on to the Sabbath School committee and have no idea</i><br>

<i>&gt; interesting Sabbath School ideas.</i><br>
<p>
Our church had such poor attendence at 9:30 am, with most showing up about<br>
9:45 or 10:00 that the SS "program" was done away with...in stages.  First<br>
the program proper was cut, but the song service remained (some still liked<br>
to sing prior to lesson study).  Then this too was poorly attended and was<br>
finally cut.<br>
<p>
So now we have lesson study from 9:30 till 10:30 am.  No one creates a SS<br>
"program".  After all, it was nothing more than a mini-church service (song<br>
service, scripture, prayer, special music, a talk, closing prayer) and then<br>
lesson study which never had enough time to get into the study.  I personally<br>
prefer the hour lesson study over the half hour we used to get.  Even an hour<br>
is rather short some times.<br>
<p>
If you do want the more traditional approach and want ideas for SS programs,<br>
try reading the ideas that Dorothy Watts has put together.  I think they are<br>
available at the ABC in a book or booklet format.<br>

<i>&gt; -------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;There is entirely too much trust of governments among SDAs.  Its been</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fortold that the U.S. would speak like a dragon.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree, SDAs should pay more attention to prophecy, especially these days.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Some don't seem to believe it, but bible prophecy has never failed, no matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; how unlikely it seemed at the time they were given.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Bible prophecy has not failed, but human interpretation thereof has<br>
failed many times.  In our own church are many examples, beginning with<br>
the 1843/44 fiasco.  In this century, many false interpretations have<br>
been given, particularly around the time of the world wars, but also<br>
having to do with Kennedy's election and even the landing on the moon.<br>
I think it's entirely possible to have too much of an obsession with<br>
trying to figure out enigmatic scriptures while forgetting the sum and<br>
substance of scripture (an obvious recent example is David Koresh).  Is<br>
it necessary to have a "correct" view of prophecy in order to be saved?<br>
Will the Lord judge us on this basis?<br>

<i>&gt; From: K-leb D'Cat &lt;BE7116503@v9000.ntu.ac.sg&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: Shooting at Big Brother</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Randall A Helzerman says:</i><br>
<i>&gt; -------------------------</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Yes, evil people can commit all kinds of mayhem with weapons.  But you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;don't seriously think that the government is composed of all angels do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why should [ the government ] get all the guns?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rom 13:1-5 [...snip...]</i><br>
<p>
I understand the argument relating to submitting to rightful government,<br>
but I have trouble accepting the view that this should extend beyond the<br>
point that a government's actions begin to interfere with one's duty to<br>
and relationship with God.  Once that point is reached, I feel that one<br>
is (or should be) duty-bound to resist that interference.<br>
<p>
That that resistence should *only* consist of armed, physical force either<br>
initially or other than as an absolute last possible resort I do reject,<br>
however.<br>
<p>
Using Romans 13:1-5 to support an argument that one should *never* resist<br>
a government gone wrong looks, to me, as leading to the argument that, for<br>
example, the German Nazi or Imperial Japanese governments of the 1930's and<br>
40's should not have been resisted. (Oh, nuts...I've gone and brought *him*<br>
into the discussion.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Steve Hix says to Steve Timm:</i><br>
<i>&gt; -----------------------------</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Who said "put not your trust in princes"? (The concordance in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the Bible here at work is *really* pitiful...) It's more true now than it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;was then, if for no other reason than current "princes" can do more damage</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that the ancients could.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At least your "princes" don't feed you to lions for entertainment. So, if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't trust princes, who do we trust, our guns i suppose?</i><br>
<p>
I did not say that.<br>
<p>
We (SDA's) put altogether too much trust in our respective governments, and<br>
often (at least here in the U.S.) condemn others who disagree with what our<br>
government may be doing. Sometimes the condemnation is justified, sometimes<br>
it is not.<br>
<p>
Don't make the mistake of assuming that anyone who disagrees with the civil<br>
authority is preaching (or desiring) armed overthrow of that authority.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Ps 146:3-7 3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom</i><br>
<p>
Thanks! :}<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Even Jesus gave his disciples leave to arm themselves for self-defense...and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;it is equally clear that irresponsible use of them was not part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;package.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If Jesus told them to go around armed, why is there no record of any of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; disciples going around armed, or using weapons in Acts, like Paul, who</i><br>
<i>&gt; frequently faced openly hostile, persecuitive people?</i><br>
<p>
Because the apostles understood the difference between a criminal attacking in<br>
the night and a conflict between their message and false philosophies?<br>
<p>
Perhaps because the laws of Rome, which allowed for self-defense, did not<br>
countenance civil unrest, which would have been the result if Paul engaged<br>
in dancing with the rioters?<br>

Brad,<br>
	While I was at Oakwood College, I worked with the youth division <br>
sabbath school. I learned that people value SS more when they play an active <br>
part in the program. I can't remember a single sabbath were the traditional SS <br>
format was use (prayer, scripture, mission story, ect.). Most of our programs <br>
were active programs. I presented one program where several twins were asked to <br>
give to different versions of SDA doctrine. The audience was to decide which <br>
was truth and which was error.<br>
	We also had skits and plays. We even had a short concert one sabbath. <br>
It's important to be creative and get the mebers involved. Also base your <br>
programs on some items like the one's Jerry mentioned. Especially if there are <br>
youth that you want to interest. Finally, assign various members to be apart of <br>
the planned program . <br>
	By the way, we didn't totally trash the SS school format. In the end, <br>
we found a way to incorporate the mission story in our program and we always <br>
had prayer and scripture. We just changed the way we presented it all.<br>
<p>
God Bless,<br>
Clayton<br>

Nicely summarized, Steve.  One small addition:  Rea also sought to<br>
"smoke out" the policy makers by being polemic.  He was daring them<br>
to come to the table with a theology that was different from what<br>
he'd been taught at PUC and what he'd "heard" throughout his ministry.<br>
I think until the Desmond Ford dustup he largely believed that there<br>
was no questioning of SDA theological positions.  A couple of us tried<br>
very hard to get Walter to make the book more scholarly and to avoid the<br>
"bald conclusions" and raw diatribe, but he felt that only by being<br>
accusatory would he get any substantial number of people to look/listen.<br>
By the way, he may have been correct in his assessment of how to be<br>
heard.  I'm by no means sanguine at this point that I was right about<br>
tone given his objective(s).<br>
<p>
He was one of the early identifiers of the Davenport problem.  He brought<br>
two church members to discuss the Davenport "investments" with me.  I<br>
reviewed them and 1)told them that they were modified Ponzi schemes,<br>
and would ultimately fail; 2)went to the local conference president<br>
with another lawyer as a witness and "persuaded" him that the So. Calif.<br>
Conf. could never invest with Davenport [I was on the Executive Committee<br>
at the time, I think] -- So. Calif. Conf. was spared the problem at the<br>
church level although a lot of individual church members were hurt;<br>
3)told Ken Emmerson at the GC, who began to advise all the conferences,<br>
unions and institutions to be very careful; 4)met with Neal Wilson who<br>
thought I was overly concerned and "checked with a union president"<br>
who told him that "Wiley is over reacting;" 5)the union president<br>
nevertheless got his money from Davenport AFTER my conversation with<br>
Neal; 6)the "investments" came unglued.  During this time Walter Rea<br>
was also warning everyone who would listen that the Davenport "investements"<br>
were not real investments and that institutions and members should<br>
stay away from them.  As I recall Rea got "scolded" by some church<br>
officers for that as well.<br>
<p>
So much for a behind the scenes "history" of interesting times in<br>
the church.  I've been fortunate or unfortunate enought to be close<br>
to some of the upheavals we've experienced, and to have been a part<br>
of some good outcomes too.  "War stories"?<br>

I went to Living Springs in Manhattan yesterday.  It's on 60th between<br>
Park and Lexington (near Central Park).  It's run by an SDA group from<br>
upstate New York and is open Sunday through Friday.  They serve about<br>
350 people a day and the style is buffet with seating a cross between<br>
true restaurant style and cafeteria.  Cost for a large lunch was about<br>
$8 and most meals would be closer to $6.<br>
<p>
The food was very good.  They've somehow found a happy medium between<br>
bland and selling out (use of lots of fats and so forth).  I don't<br>
think they use dairy products and am not sure if there are any other<br>
restrictions they follow.<br>
<p>
They push a spiritual message there (literature rack) but it's very<br>
low key.  I don't know if they are financially viable.  I believe<br>
their rent is something like $12K a month and taxes $6K.  A similar<br>
restaurant near Wall Street, Country Life, closed become of economic<br>
problems.<br>

Hello. I am new to this list and have a question that maybe all you<br>
knowledgeable people can answer.<br>
Is the SDA church the only one to practise the 'ordinance of humility'<br>
(footwashing)? Which SDA 'pioneer' introduced the practise in the church<br>
and when?<br>
Thanks<br>
Bruno (gaeta@angis.su.oz.au)<br>
<p>
[Actually footwashing is a well-established Catholic custom, albeit<br>
practiced only by the Pope every Maundy Thursday.  SDA's were not the first<br>
nor are we the only denomination to do it for all the members, however.<br>
Those with more info please shed light (certainly Worldwide Church of God<br>
and Church of God 7th-day do it as well, but I think there are more others<br>
beyond this.)  SCT]<br>

</ul>
<!-- body="start" -->
I just returned from the memorial service for Dennis Grumling, SDAnet<br>
member and member along with me of the Elmhurst, SDA church.   Though<br>
I have conveyed my condolences to the family members (also SDAnet members)<br>
I wish to use the net to do the same.  When Dennis made his views known, <br>
it was often as the voice of reason.  He will be greatly missed.<br>
<p>
I present a reprise of his own words, written on SDAnet about two years<br>
ago.  This post was written in the midst of a dating discussion.  Fittingly,<br>
I received a private query on this topic just on Friday, which the post<br>
addresses quite well, I think.<br>
<p>
Steve Timm<br>
<p>
[Dennis's words follow below  SCT]<br>
<p>
Another aspect of dating outside of your faith that has not been brought<br>
up is, if you choose to date (and it is a choice!) outside your faith,<br>
and you try to witness to this person, what happens when this person<br>
becomes interested in your faith but you decide that you are not<br>
interested in marriage or continued dating with this person??  Do you<br>
dump the person, knowing full well that it will likely turn them away<br>
from your faith?  Do you keep dating and try to pretend that all is<br>
well?<br>
 <br>
Yes, I realize that ideally you will break up but remain friends and<br>
keep witnessing to them.  I've got news for any idealists on this<br>
conference:  it just ain't so.  I have seen this type of situation<br>
happen all too often.  And, even when the church that the dating couple<br>
has been attending is sensitive enough to try and build bridges to the<br>
individuals involved in the hope that a break up will not mean a loss of<br>
faith to either of them, it is a difficult and tenuous proposition at<br>
best.<br>
 <br>
Perhaps I should phrase the question more bluntly:  Is it a good idea to<br>
mix hormones and Bible study?  How does the giver of the studies, let<br>
alone the receiver, determine who/what is being responded to--the Holy<br>
Spirit or the siren call of love?  How do you keep the two separate,<br>
especially when the two roads (dating and Bible study) diverge?<br>
 <br>
I don't think it is possible to keep the two separate, and therefore<br>
would not recommend dating outside of one's faith, if one values one's<br>
faith and respects the other person as a human with the right to make<br>
faith choices.  However, I would love to hear other views on this.<br>

As I did during Dennis' illness, I will be glad to collect any electronic<br>
wishes that you may have to send to the family.  Send them to me.<br>
<p>
I start with my own, and you will forgive me for posting in tongues.<br>
I will give the scriptural references for each part of the German.<br>
You must all imagine the orchestra and chorus playing and singing the <br>
music of Brahms as you read, the capacity to send sound files not <br>
being perfected as yet.<br>
<p>
(Matthew 5:4)<br>
Selig sind, die da Lied tragen,<br>
denn sie sollen getroestet werden<br>
<p>
(Psalms 126:5,6)<br>
Die mit Tranen saen werden mit Freuden ernten,<br>
Sie gehen hin und weinen, und tragen edlen Samen,<br>
und kommen mit Freuden und bringen ihre Garben.<br>
<p>
(1 Peter 1:24)<br>
Denn alles Fleisch es ist wie Gras<br>
und alle Herrlichkeit des Menschen wie des Grases Blumen.<br>
Das Gras ist verdoret, und die Blume abgefallen.<br>
<p>
(James 5:27)<br>
So seid nun geduldig, lieben Bruder,<br>
bis auf die Zukunft des Herrn<br>
Siehe ein Ackermann wartet auf die kostliche Frucht der Erde<br>
und ist geduldig daruber,<br>
bis er empfahe den Morgenregen und Abendregen,<br>
So seid Geduldig,<br>
<p>
(1 Peter 1:25)<br>
Aber des Herrn Wort bleibet in Ewigkeit               &lt;---amen!<br>
<p>
(Isaiah 35:10)<br>
Die Erloseten des Herrn werden wiederkommen,<br>
und gen Zion kommen mit Jauchzen;<br>
Freude, ewige Freude wird uber ihrem Haupte sein;<br>
Freude und Wonne werden sie ergreifen,<br>
und Schmerz und Seufzen wird weg mussen.<br>
<p>
(Psalms 39:4-7)<br>
Herr, lehre doch mich, das ein Ende mit mir haben muss,<br>
und mein Leben ein Ziel hat, und ich davon muss.<br>
Siehe, meine Tage sind einer Handbreit vor dir,<br>
und mein Leben ist wie nichts for dir.<br>
Ach, wie gar nichts sind alle Menschen,<br>
die doch so sicher leben.<br>
Sie gehen daher wie ein Schemen,<br>
 und machen ihnen viel vergebliche Unruhe;<br>
sie sammeln und wissen nicht, wer es kriegen wird.<br>
Nun Herr, wes soll ich mich trosten?  Ich hoffe auf dich.<br>
<p>
(Wisdom 3:1)<br>
Der Gerechten Seelen sind in Gottes Hand und keine Qual rurhet sie an.<br>
<p>
(Psalm 84:1-2,4)<br>
Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen, Here Zebaoth!<br>
Meine Seele verlanget und sehnet sich nach den Vorhofen des Herrn;<br>

Wohl denen, die in deinem Hause wohnen,<br>
die loben dich immerdarl.<br>

Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit; aber ich will euch wieder sehen,<br>

und eure Freude soll niemand von euch nehmen.<br>
<p>
(Isaiah 66:13)<br>
Ich will euch trosten, wie einen seine Mutter trostet.<br>

Sehet mich an:  ich habe eine kleine Zeit<br>
Muhe und Arbeit gehabt, und habe grossen Trost funden.<br>

Relative vs absolute truth.  During my sojourn at Andrews, I was forced<br>
to take a class that I detested.  Taught by Dr. Asa Thoreson, it was called<br>
"Philosophical Biology".  In the intervening years, I have come to <br>
recognize it as one of the most important classes that I have ever taken.<br>
I took a gem of truth from that class, courtesy of Dr. Thoreson that has<br>
helped me in more ways than I can count.  Thanks, Doc.  "All truth is<br>
relative, the only absolute truth is God".<br>
<p>
This allows one to make sense of a great deal of what one encounters in the<br>
world.<br>
<p>
While I'm on the topic of prior teachers, I also owe a great debt to<br>
Dr. Robert Fadely.  Experimental Psych left me with another gem that<br>
has stood the test of time, and been a great confort and stabilizing<br>
influence in my life.  "Things take more time than they do" Dr. R.C. Fadely.<br>
A VERY profound statement the more you think about it, and has helped<br>
immeasurably in my carrer as a Software Engineer.<br>
Cheers<br>

Dennis (I'm sorry that I never knew him) argued that dating outside the<br>
faith always leads to the confusion of love of the faith and love of the<br>
human partner, especially if the dating partners stop dating.<br>
<p>
I just wanted to relate my own story which contradicts this theory.<br>
My first contact with Seventh-Day Adventism was through a young Adventist<br>
woman I dated just after graduation from college.  I was unaware at the<br>
time that our relationship began that she was Adventist and didn't even<br>
have a clue as to what that meant.  I started attending church with her<br>
soon after our relationship began because I was searching for meaning in<br>
my life and because I sensed that her church was an important part of her<br>
life.  We broke up within three months, but I continued attending the<br>
church, essentially continually, and was baptized about two years later.<br>
<p>
Now I am not advocating that single Adventists should actively seek<br>
romantic relationships with non-Adventists as a form of witnessing.  In my<br>
case, as a non-Adventist I initiated the relationship with an Adventist. <br>
What I am trying to say is that sometimes God works in mysterious ways. <br>
If a single Adventist is asked by a non-Adventist to form a romantic<br>
relationship, I would suggest much prayer and Bible study before<br>
responding either positively or negatively.  In most cases, I would expect<br>
that the answer should be "no", but occasionally the answer might<br>
appropriately be "yes".<br>

Marcus mentioned some time ago that EGW repeatedly used phrases like<br>
"truth for this time".  The implication was that if it was truth for her<br>
time it is not truth for our time, and further that this implication leads<br>
naturally to the conclusion that much of the Bible was truth for the time<br>
at which it was written but is no longer truth for our time.<br>
<p>
I am very uncomfortable with these conclusions and would like to<br>
systematically study the phrases in question.  If Marcus, and anyone with<br>
similar opinions, could post a set of phrases and or references which seem<br>
to imply the conclusions stated above, I will use a CD-ROM version of the<br>
EGW writings to study them and will report my findings to the net.<br>

I don't disagree with this possibility.  However, it is not incidental <br>
that what some<br>
view as the "evil" in government, is viewed as "good" by others toward <br>
that same<br>
government, even among SDA's...  Making adult gun owners, distributors <br>
and makers<br>
more responsible, and accountable is viewed in this light.  This is no <br>
different than the<br>
rules we had the Pornography industry comply with.  If we think the gun <br>
ownership<br>
issue is different because of "self defense", rules placed on manufacturers and<br>
distributors of the above mentioned material, were for the self defense <br>
of children,<br>
women, and the family.<br>
<p>
So, we agree that one's right to own a gun need not, be taken away by <br>
regulating<br>
the gun industry - correct?  Is there more than one way? What are they, <br>
if there are?<br>
What should Christians be doing in support of these ways?  Are there <br>
underlying issues<br>
involved in gun "misuse"?  If so, what are they, and should Christians <br>
be interested in<br>
addressing these issues?<br>

<i>&gt; From: Ralf Simonsson (Tel 90-3930770, f: 773, k 915145499)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: Guns</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am not a theologian, but I will try to clarify my point</i><br>
<p>
Me neither...but it shouldn't stop us. :}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ---------</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; the sixth commandment - in my Bible there are no exclusions in that </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; commandment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The Hebrew translates to "murder" in english, not "kill".  There is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;*some* difference in meaning.</i><br>
<i>&gt; -------</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well I see just juridicial difference - when you buy a gun, is it not </i><br>
<i>&gt; for killing, otherwise a tear gas patron would do.</i><br>
<p>
No. That may be end result, but it should not be the intended purpose.<br>
<p>
Ignoring target shooting, hunting, and other legal uses, self-defense<br>
intent is to stop potential rape or deadly attacks. (The *vast* majority<br>
of with-gun defenses in the U.S. result in no injury to either party, nor<br>
discharge of the firearm. The numbers, according to a large number of<br>
studies of the issue range from 500,000/yr on up. *One* significant study<br>
places the number almost an order of magnitude lower, at 80,000/yr, but<br>
its methodology is believed to greatly underreport actual events.)<br>
<p>
Another thing to consider is that in several parts of the country, one<br>
may purchase a handgun for self defense, but things like mace, tear gas<br>
and pepper sprays are *illegal* for civilian use. The justification is<br>
that criminals might get some spray and use it against a police officer.<br>
It's a crazy situation, but it's what a lot of us live with.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; --------</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Note also: Exodus 22:1,2; Luke 22:35,36; Esther 8, 9 and 10 (I was </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more than somewhat startled to read this last one after a *long* time </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of neglecting it for other parts.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; ---------</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let us look at Luke first:</i><br>
<i>&gt; It was after the last supper - Luke 22:35-38: Then Jesus asked. "When I </i><br>
<i>&gt; sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Nothing" they answered. </i><br>
<i>&gt; He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and if you don4t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. It is </i><br>
<i>&gt; written: 4And he was numbered with the transgressors4; and I tell you </i><br>
<i>&gt; that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is </i><br>
<i>&gt; reaching its fulfillment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "That is enough." he replied.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The disciples misunderstood Jesus words as we read 12 verses later (Luke </i><br>
<i>&gt; 22:51 - But Jesus answered, "No more of this" And he touched the mans </i><br>
<i>&gt; ear and healed him.</i><br>
<p>
They almost certainly did misunderstand. He was not involving Himself in<br>
a political uprising, nor were they to do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You have heard it was said to the people long ago, do not murder, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone that murders will be subject to judgment. But I tell you that </i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone who is angry with his brother, will be subject to judgment.</i><br>
<p>
*I* have no problem with that. Offensive force is unjustified, while<br>
defensive use of force may be under some circumstances.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The sword mentioned was  more a knife to be used  for cutting bread  </i><br>
<i>&gt; (presumably in the bag).</i><br>
<p>
OK...<br>
<p>
(Now why would that suddenly become important? One could still break<br>
bread by hand.  Such a knife could *still* be used as a weapon...it's<br>
nothing more than a tool, and the critical factor is the use it's put<br>
to.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Then about the texts in the OT - the text in the sermon on the mount </i><br>
<i>&gt; shows that Jesus did not approve the killing in the OT, and we can leave </i><br>
<i>&gt; them by that instead for a lenghty discussion why God commanded the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Israelites to kill everybody in conquered cities etc.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well to go back to my original point about achieving guns - cars are not </i><br>
<i>&gt; mainly for killing people. If you use them for that you would be </i><br>
<i>&gt; prosecuted - at least in Finland.</i><br>
<p>
Here to, and rightly so.<br>
<p>
Guns *here* (and in Finland, according to Finns that I correspond with<br>
on the net) are not *primarily* used for killing people, either by design<br>
or by intent of purchaser.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;The point of self-defense (the which I believe to be defensible) is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to *stop* the attacker, not to kill him.  The problem is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;*effective* methods of stopping are very often potentially-lethal,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and non-lethal tools are too often ineffective.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ---------</i><br>
<i>&gt; You got my point! Do not get a gun - you might kill somebody!</i><br>
<p>
I still say that one should leave the question up to the individual.<br>
<p>
Other means of defense involve a non-zero risk of death to weilder or<br>
target, even teargas sprays.  In fact, in many cases, the gun is the<br>
least-damaging option, since it is most likely, in the most number of<br>
cases, to cause an attacker to break off his attack.<br>
<p>
In any case, the gun is the absolute *last* resort.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Still, a decision that should be left up to the individual's </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;conscience.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ----------</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is *not* on an individual's conscience. This is not a personal matter </i><br>
<i>&gt; - as eg homosexuality in most of the cases is - by killing or even </i><br>
<i>&gt; injuring an other person you are intruding in his/hers life in a very </i><br>
<i>&gt; drastic way</i><br>
<p>
A murderer or rapist or armed robber has already gone over the line.<br>
<p>
If you choose to not resist under and circumstances, that is your choice,<br>
and I have no problem with that.<br>
<p>
Some others may, in good faith, choose otherwise (and hope never to have<br>
to deal with such sever problems). If I had no wife or children, I think<br>
I might choose differently, perhaps.<br>
<p>
This is the last that I'll discuss on this issue.  I think that we've<br>
reached bedrock here, and further discussion is unlikely to bring up<br>
anything new or interesting.<br>
<p>
You're still invited for lunch if you visit, though.  :}<br>

[David P. Harris writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; Some of us who grew up in the church, and have been hearing Bible stories</i><br>
<i>&gt; since the Kindergarten, have a distorted picture of the Bible characters.</i><br>
                                 ^^^^^^^^^<br>
Shoulda come to my Sabbath schools 8-).  At age appropriate times, there<br>
was no dissembling as to David's faults.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; but let's examine his  life, briefly.</i><br>
Fortunately, there's more to David's life than just what follows.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   He was an adulterer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   A cold-blooded murderer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   He had a quick temper.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   He was a bad father.</i><br>
             ^^^<br>
Not completely.  Note how often Solomon, in Proverbs, said he'd learned<br>
this or that piece of wisdom from his Dad.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   He was an exhibitionist. (Dancing naked in the streets.  God loved that.)</i><br>
                                      ^^^^^ 2 Sam 6:14 does not support this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I do not think that there is a whole lot about David that we would admire in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a church or civic leader today.</i><br>
<p>
Scripture paints an honest picture of David.  From the picture, we can<br>
distinguish the times when he was wise and when he was foolish.  From<br>
these examples (cf 1 Cor 10:11), we can receive instruction in wisdom<br>
(Prov 9:9, 1:7, 8:33, 10:17, 12:1, 13:18, 23:23) and what characterizes<br>
Godly living.  Invariably, when David was foolish it was because he was<br>
depending upon his own smarts, when he was wise it was because he was<br>
humble, sought the Lord's advise, and waited for God's timing.  An example<br>
of this is when David "escaped" to Gath, moved into Ziklag, then got caught<br>
in the corner of the war between Achish and Saul (1 Sam ch 29 and 30).<br>
I observe that seeking God's will, ways, and timing is something that church<br>
and civic leaders would do well to emulate.<br>
<p>
When rebuked, David did not resist but accepted the correction (2 Sam 12).<br>
This is praiseworthy; we tend to react and become upset if someone rebukes us.<br>
David understood true repentance and humility (Ps 34:18, ch 51), rare<br>
attributes in our society.  David understood the need to respect leadership,<br>
even when they were messed up; he trusted God to remove faulty leaders<br>
in God's own way and time, so he would not touch the Lord's anointed.<br>
Are these not characteristics which would be valuable in us all?<br>
<p>
David wrote many psalms of praise to God; he frequently stood up in the<br>
congregation to utter praise to God; he spent much time, esp as a youth,<br>
meditating up Scripture.  Without David, major portions of Scripture that<br>
uplift and ennoble character would be missing.<br>
<p>
True enough, David, that the record of the Bible's David is checkered and<br>
that this demonstrates how God patiently works with us.<br>

Carnegie Mellon has decided to abolish its Bitnet connection on<br>
one week's notice.  This may mean that there will be a period of time<br>
where I will not be recognized as the listowner of SDA-L, or even be able<br>
to post.  We can work it out eventually, but there may be some interruptions.<br>
The most important consequence (and this goes for SDA-L and SDAnet) is<br>
that ANDREW will no longer be in the maps as a Bitnet node and so<br>
Bitnet-only users will have to bounce off of a gateway.  Use<br>
the Internet address st0o@andrew.cmu.edu to reach me if you can.<br>
If you have to bounce off a gateway because you only have Bitnet,<br>
I will try to let you know how to do so.<br>
<p>
for instance, for Bitnet only users<br>
<p>
st0o%andrew.cmu.edu@MITVMA   should work.<br>

I hope that we in Australia do not become as concerned about<br>
guns as you Americans appear to be. I almost feel glad that I have<br>
only ever been in the states fro 4 hours total.<br>
<p>
Now, where did I put my defensive boomerang. I need it for my next visit.<br>

Many Mennonite groups do this (footwashing). I have even been in a pentecostal fellowship that practiced it on occasion.<br>

Hi, friends,<br>
<p>
I feel that I have made some good friends electronically through SDA-Net<br>
and to you I say goodbye.  I am leaving<br>
the 'Land of SDA-Net' to begin a new course of study.  I wish that<br>
I would have had more time to contribute to the discussions because <br>
one voice--the male one--is heard loud and clear on this net.  Unfortunately,<br>
the women who do belong contribute infrequently.  I'm curious why that is<br>
so.  Are we too busy?  Are we uninterested in the current topics?  Are we<br>
afraid of the flames?  Do we feel comfortable in this group of people?<br>
I, for one, feel very uncomfortable commmunicating within a group that believes<br>
that they have a "God-given" right to be the "head" of a woman; or where<br>
the full rights of being a human are not acknowledged; or where we <br>
justify women being given the right to work as a minister but not to be<br>
recognized as a full-fledged one.  All of these positions are taken using<br>
the word of the Holy One as justification.<br>
<p>
[Of the 165 members of SDAnet, 18 are women, counting Sue.  The ratio has<br>
been higher in the past.  Perhaps most to blame for this are all those<br>
who steer young women away from technical fields.  As for the lack of <br>
participation, perhaps we should not attribute to fear what may instead<br>
be attributed to good judgment, holding peace whilst the males make <br>
fools of themselves.  Sue's voice will be missed.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<p>
In the latest issue of Ponderings, Merikay made the suggestion that, since<br>
commissioned ministers are, according to Mostert (excuse my spelling), <br>
essentially the same as ordained ones, why not have women be ordained for<br>
the next hundred years and men be commissioned?  What do you think?  <br>
<p>
Personally, I think the ordination issue is a great way to keep us from<br>
focusing on the real problem of women's position in the church.  Women who<br>
are &gt; 60% of the church membership are not represented in the decision<br>
making bodies of the church.  THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM.  THAT IS OPPRESSION!!!<br>
Why is it that men are so determined to keep center stage?  Why are men<br>
so afraid to share the responsibility of making decisions--in the home<br>
and in the church?  Is power that addicting?<br>
<p>
I belong to a list that involves discussions of females and males about<br>
women's position in society.  Some of the men on that list have renewed <br>
my faith in the possibility that men might be able to see the privilege <br>
that is given to them because of nothing more than the genitals with which they<br>
were born.  I am posting with this note a letter from a man <br>
who wrote in response to<br>
the article that appeared in the New York Times on Sunday.  The article<br>
was written by a female graduate student at Princeton.  She knew no one<br>
who had ever been raped, however, she wrote an article attempting to<br>
redefine the concept of rape.<br>
<p>
I hope you enjoy this posting.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Both Roiphe and Camille Paglia share an assumption that has a lot of<br>
theoretical implications:  that male people will not change, that fem-<br>
inism cannot or will not have any meaningful effect on how men behave.<br>
<p>
Given the parameters of what this assumption means, in contrast to its<br>
alternative (that men are NOT like the weather, NOT beyond agentic change<br>
and therefore to be merely coped with), I direct your attention to the<br>
equally problematic first-level simple alternative:  that, yes, feminism<br>
CAN TOO have the necessary effect on male behavior, and, by doing so,<br>
make it possible for women to move beyond adaptive modes of response to<br>
patriarchy.  The problem here is that such a stance leads--or at least<br>
can lead--to a prescription for women to expend their energies trying<br>
to change men, i.e., "giving their female energies over to men" (Daly).<br>
<p>
But I don't think it is either/or.  I think feminism definitely WILL<br>
change men and male behavior, (although I think that at some point, it<br>
must include male ACTIVE, rather than PASSIVE, participation, in order<br>
to result in a widely adopted re-definition of masculinity by males,<br>
and the definition of any group must ultimately be internal), but that<br>
feminism is at its most effective in making changes among men when it is<br>
primarily oriented towards speaking women's truths in women's terms, not<br>
as attempts to placate-and-change a bunch of guys.<br>
Males ARE changing.  I see it, I sense it strongly; to be a nineteen-year-<br>
old guy is qualitatively different from how it was in 1978 when I was 18,<br>
and the differences are in a feminist direction.<br>
<p>
Keep on doing what you've been doing; build on it, but believe that it is<br>
a good work.  I grew up inspired by feminism and it affected who I am for<br>
years and years.  Males will listen and understand (perhaps not universally,<br>
but then, most people of any category within patriarchy do not do their<br>
own thinking; it's strongly discouraged!).  And...keep some space to your-<br>
selves as explicitly womyn's space, but be inclusive sometime and let those<br>
of us who wish to participate play a role in what you are doing; it is our<br>
gender that must be changed, for the most part, and you must sense that in<br>
order for it to ever really take hold, our changes must be heartfelt, from<br>
us, not concessions made by us in the face of commentary from the outside.<br>
A lot of the backlash is fueled by males who wish to define themselves<br>
rather than be defined by women telling them how to be, and unfortunately,<br>
the inarticulate binary-thinking reactionary stuff tends to weigh in first.<br>
They do not, however, speak for our gender, and there are a growing many of<br>
us who have heard you (collectively) and have since then done our own<br>
thinking, and who are enthusiastically ready willing and hopefully able to<br>
play a meaningful role by self-defining manhood outside of patriarchal<br>
patterns.  I don't know if that makes us "feminists" or if some other term<br>
is more appropriate, but whether you call it "feminism" or "ishmakabbible",<br>
I think it means that yes there will be change, and no it is not entirely<br>
the burden of your gender to change all of our gender.<br>
<p>
In light of that, Paglia and Roiphe are "conservative" in the sense of<br>
planning for the worst scenario possible, which I think dampens revolu-<br>
tionary fervor"<br>
<p>
I hope this gives you some joy.<br>
<p>

In a decision this Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that a Hialeah, FL<br>
sect  (in the Santeria movement) has the right to do animal sacrifices.<br>
Taken in conjunction with the school prayer and equal access decisions <br>
also announced that day, it seems like there is still quite a bit <br>
of place for religious freedom available in the minds of the Court.<br>
<p>
However, it was interesting to hear Paul Harvey's comment on the decision.<br>
In the Paul Harvey News and Comment (which Good Michigan SDA's all listen to)<br>
he spent several minutes of uncharacteristically xenophobic commentary <br>
on this (it strikes at the mores of this country)  (other countries are<br>
telling the people whose customs don't fit to just stay out.) (If the<br>
justices didn't leave this decision to their law clerks, they should<br>
have).<br>
<p>
What is the feedback that others have heard  on this decision?  I don't think<br>
it even made the Chicago newspapers, at least I didn't see it in the ones<br>
I bought.  Do or should we feel more free because we have the religious <br>
liberty to do animal sacrifice?<br>

<p>
   I recently read something like this on another newsgroup:<br>
<p>
<p>
Basically the law (that was done away with) implies: <br>
<p>
   If someone kills a chicken, cooks it, blesses it and eats it, that's just <br>
   fine.  But if one first blesses it, then kills, cooks, and eats it, s/he <br>
   can go to jail.<br>
<p>
(Sorry if that's not a direct quote.  I didn't save the article.)<br>

The analysis I read on the decision is that a statute that narrowly<br>
defines an otherwise legal behavior as illegal is unconstitutional.<br>
The statute in Hialeah, FL, was passed specifically to prohibit<br>
animal sacrifices. (Flame on) Killing animals for food is not considered <br>
illegal behavior unless you're a member of PETA. (Flame off)<br>
<p>
I wish I had a copy of the editorial. It was from the Scripps Howard<br>
Newspapers line and published in yesterday's _Chicago Tribune_ in the<br>
lower right-hand corner of the op-ed page. <br>
<p>
It went on to say, however, that it doesn't mean that the Smith v. Oregon<br>
case was overturned. As a refresher, the US SC ruled that a religious<br>
ritual that goes against an illegal act of the state is still illegal. That<br>
was the case where that Native American group used peyote, an illicit<br>
substance under Oregon statutes, in their religious ritual and were<br>
charged with using an illegal drug. Thus, the need for the Freedom of <br>
Religion Restoration Act is still urgent.<br>
<p>
Bottom line: The Santeria case is an isolated one. The Supreme Court<br>
did their job on this one, but full freedom of religious expression<br>
still does not exist.<br>
<p>
Guess I won't feel good until I put that lamb on the spit! ;)<br>

Someone is trying to put some enthusiasm into Sabbath School. What a great<br>
idea. Sabbath School has become so boring that I know of two instances<br>
at Avondale this year where noone turned up to take the preliminaries<br>
and the church pastor had to step in at the last minute.<br>
<p>
Here are some ideas that I would enjoy is Sabbath School.<br>
<p>
1.  Involve a lot of people. This guarantees at least a minimum attendence<br>
<p>
2.  Provide alternative study themes. 12 weeks on some topics is just too<br>
    much.<br>
<p>
3.  Explore the use of partipatory arts. Music, drama(tut tut), photography<br>
    literature etc. I read some of Henry Lawson to several Sabbath School<br>
    classes during the lessons on Job. (Henry Lawson is an Australian<br>
    author who wrote some fine australian literature about 90 odd years<br>
    ago. The article I read was "Shall we gather at the River" and gives<br>
    a moving insight into suffering and bitterness in a pioneer Australian<br>
    setting)<br>
<p>
4.  What about things like cooking demonstrations. I took a class on <br>
    Bread baking during the health series of lessons.<br>
<p>
5.  A series on Marriage enrichment, or how to relate to the unchurched<br>
    is another possibility.<br>
<p>
6.  One of the most interesting Sabbath School series I attended was hearing<br>
    from other people about their sense of mission. We heard from Anglicans,<br>
    Salvation Army, youth workers, prison officers, parole officers,<br>
    doctors, teachers, Bible society workers and others. It was a real<br>
    eye opener and made many of us realise that SDAism is not the centre<br>
    of the universe.<br>
<p>
7.  What about a prayer session? It would require some preparation<br>
    so that you don't end up "blessing the missionaries and asking<br>
    forgiveness for unspecified sins" for an hour.<br>
<p>
8.  Target special groups. Put on a Sabbath School specially for children.<br>
    They do it often enough for us.<br>
<p>
9.  Have Sabbath School after the Church service as  a discussion based<br>
    on the service. This arrangement is a great excuse for skipping<br>
    the preliminaries.<br>
<p>
I have said enough. Suffice it to say that I find most ordinary Sabbath<br>
Schools dull and uninteresting, and whenever I get the opportunity I<br>
do something different.<br>

Sorry to "see" Sue leave.  A couple of years ago in the SS class I teach<br>
we spent a few weeks discussing why women are the large majority in the<br>
pews on Sabbath, but men are the large majority on the platform.  <br>
<p>
One serious problem for a church is the policy decision that our operational<br>
policies will be as near uniform as possible around the world for we are a<br>
"worldwide church."  That meant that at GC in Indianapolis North America<br>
was outvoted by the other nations on the issue of the ordination of women.<br>
One might ask, "Why assume that was a GC policy decision?" but once it was<br>
decided that it was a GC decision to make, then North America was outvoted.<br>

Sorry to "see" Sue leave.  A couple of years ago in the SS class I teach<br>
we spent a few weeks discussing why women are the large majority in the<br>
pews on Sabbath, but men are the large majority on the platform.  <br>
<p>
One serious problem for a church is the policy decision that our operational<br>
policies will be as near uniform as possible around the world for we are a<br>
"worldwide church."  That meant that at GC in Indianapolis North America<br>
was outvoted by the other nations on the issue of the ordination of women.<br>
One might ask, "Why assume that was a GC policy decision?" but once it was<br>
decided that it was a GC decision to make, then North America was outvoted.<br>

A few weeks ago, a "lively" discussion about homosexuality filled the<br>
SDAnet-waves.  During that discussion, I asked for suggestions on<br>
how the Church should respond or deal with homosexual members.<br>
<p>
Outside of the usual, love the "sinner hate the sin" responses, I was<br>
given no real answers.  However, a non-SDA Christian friend forwarded<br>
this notice to me.  I share it with you.<br>
===============<br>
The Denver Post<br>
June 11, 1993, pg 5B<br>
<p>
By The Fort Collins Coloradoan<br>
<p>
Colorado Methodists will use television commercials and a letter-writing<br>
campaign in an effort to repeal Amendment 2, the controversial measure that<br>
prevents state and local governments form adopting laws granting civil rights<br>
protection to homosexuals.<br>
<p>
The repeal campaign was OK'd during the recent Rocky Mountain Annual <br>
Conference<br>
of the United Methodist Church at Colorado State University.<br>
<p>
"The book of the church clearly states we affirm civil rights regardless of<br>
race, ethnic background, gender or sexual orientation," said Janet Forbes,<br>
program director for the regional United Methodist Church.<br>
<p>
"The issue was approved by a good majority."<br>
<p>
She said, "This is an example of religious diversity at work.  Many <br>
traditional<br>
churches have taken a stand against Amendment 2."<br>
<p>
Colorado voters passed Amendment 2 last November.<br>
<p>
Forbes said United Methodist Church members do not approve of only one<br>
religious group--the Colorado Springs-based fundamentalists who initiated<br>
Amendment 2--defining Christianity in Colorado.<br>
<p>
The church is applying for grants to help fund commercials about <br>
Amemdnent 2 to<br>
run in Colorado Springs.<br>
<p>
                                                     Reprinted w/o permission<br>
<p>
=====END=====<br>
I know there have to be SDA churches in Colorado, Maine, Tampa FL at this time.<br>
How are these churches dealing with this issue?  Is it a concern to <br>
them?  Is it a<br>
concern with the General Conference?  Do they even know what's going on?<br>
Is SDAnet concerned?  Should it be?<br>

To Steve and SDANET<br>
<p>
Thank all of you for your kindness at this time.  Dennis was buried yesterday<br>
in his family's plot in South Whitley, Indiana.  He is at rest in the glorious<br>
hope.  When he could no longer talk because of the intubation, he kept pointing<br>
up--his faith was strong.<br>
<p>
A group of librarians got together to set up a scholarship fund in his memory.<br>
Indiana University Foundation<br>
Dennis K. Grumling Memorial<br>
P.O. Box 500<br>
Bloomington, IN 47402.<br>
<p>
The testimony of his library colleagues at the memorial service brought out<br>
clearly that the best way of witnessing is with one's life.  Dennis did not<br>
live in vain.  He touched many others and shared love and warmth--along with a<br>
good dose of humor.<br>
<p>
We grieve not as those who have no hope.  I am making copies of all e-mail <br>
messages for Heidi.      God help us all to live for Him so that if we must<br>
die we can do so in peace.  An experience such as this serves to put life <br>
into perspective.<br>
<p>
Nancy Vyhmeister<br>

I like you post.  I says to me that we should be careful to have a more <br>
balanced<br>
view of people we call "sinners", for we know *not* the heart.<br>

Some recent postings on the relevance of Bible prophecy and what one can<br>
or cannot know motivated me to reflect on certain passages of Scripture.<br>
I'd like to share them.  And since it's just a sharing, this missive is<br>
not intended as a rebuttal, nor does it pretend to be a "tour de force".<br>
{some words below capitalized by me for emphasis; my comments in braces}<br>
<p>
PSA 19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony<br>
  of the LORD is SURE, making wise the simple.<br>
  {see also Psa 93:5, 111:7)<br>
<p>
AMOS 3:7 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but HE REVEALETH HIS SECRET<br>
  unto his servants the prophets.<br>
PE2 1:19,20 We have also a more SURE WORD OF PROPHECY; whereunto ye do well<br>
  that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the<br>
  day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:  Knowing this first, that<br>
  no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.<br>
<p>
DEU 29:29 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but THOSE THINGS<br>
  WHICH ARE REVEALED BELONG UNTO US and to our children for ever, that we may<br>
  do all the words of this law.<br>
DAN 2:28 But there is a GOD in heaven that REVEALETH SECRETS, and maketh known<br>
  to the king Nebuchadnezzar WHAT SHALL BE IN THE LATTER DAYS. Thy dream, and<br>
  the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;<br>
  {see also Matt 16:17, 1 Cor 2:10 and on, Eph 3:5}<br>
<p>
GEN 15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a<br>
  stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and they shall<br>
  afflict them four hundred years; {this prophecy was fulfilled to the very day}<br>
PRO 1:23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you,<br>
  I WILL MAKE KNOWN MY WORDS UNTO YOU.<br>
PRO 9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge<br>
  of the holy is understanding. {also Prov 1:7}<br>
PRO 22:20,21 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and<br>
  knowledge, That I might make thee KNOW THE CERTAINTY OF the words of TRUTH;<br>
  that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?<br>
JER 33:3 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and SHEW THEE great and mighty<br>
  things, which thou knowest not.<br>
ACT 2:28 Thou hast MADE KNOWN to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full<br>
  of joy with thy countenance.<br>
PE2 1:16 For WE HAVE NOT FOLLOWED CUNNINGLY DEVISED FABLES, when we made<br>
  known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were<br>
  eyewitnesses of his majesty.<br>
JO1 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the<br>
  Son of God; that ye MAY KNOW THAT YE HAVE ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may<br>
  believe on the name of the Son of God.<br>
  {see also Num 12:6, Psa 51:6, Eccl 2:6, Isa 11:2, 42:16, Jer 24:7, Dan 7:16,<br>
  Hos 4:6, John 7:17, 10:14,27, 15:15, Acts 2:28, 1 Cor 13:9, Eph 1:9,17}<br>
<p>
PSA 91:4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou<br>
  trust: HIS TRUTH shall be thy shield and buckler.<br>
JER 33:6 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and<br>
  will REVEAL UNTO THEM the abundance of peace and TRUTH.<br>
JOH 8:32 AND YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE. {!!!}<br>
JOH 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will GUIDE YOU<br>
  INTO ALL TRUTH: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall<br>
  hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.<br>
  {see also Isa 61:8, John 14:17, 17:17, 1 Thes 2:13, 2 Tim 2:15}<br>
<p>
DAN 12:4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even TO THE<br>
  TIME OF THE END: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.<br>
  {see also Isa 46:10, Dan 8:19, 12:9, Hab 2:3, 2 Tim 4:3}<br>
<p>
Therefore, on the testimony of Scripture:<br>
* We can read, understand, and know the Scriptures, including the prophecies.<br>
  They are _not_ enigmatic; they are understandable.  One of the great<br>
  achievements of the Reformation was to wrest the Scriptures from the<br>
  province of prelates and theologians so that even a common plough-boy<br>
  could read and understand Scripture.<br>
* The prophecies are written for us; they show that God cares about us.<br>
* God would not have us be ignorant (note numerous NT refs, e.g., I Th 4:13).<br>
* The Holy Spirit leads us into truth; anyone without the HS will be led<br>
  into error.  It is the unction of the Spirit that fits one for sound<br>
  preaching; no measure of scholastic training can accomplish that (note<br>
  repeated EGW comments in this regard; note that she says sound training<br>
  plus the unction of the Holy Spirit is a very good thing).<br>
* It is, at best, unkind to compare those who study prophecy with David<br>
  Koresh.  Koresh was foolish, unmindful of such verses as 1 Cor 2:13,<br>
  Isa 28:10, et al, and showed himself an example of 2 Pet 3:16.<br>
* 1843/1844 was _not_ a fiasco.  We should not be ashamed.  It was a clear<br>
  demonstration of the principle in Psa 119:105 and of God's patience.<br>
  He gives enough light for one step.  If that step is taken, He gives<br>
  enough light to take the next step.  How foolish and arrogant of us to<br>
  make light of God's leading!  And what of us, to whom much light has been<br>
  given (cf Luke 12:48)?<br>

Sue, you will be missed at least by this male.<br>
<p>
I pray that other women will somehow, feel more apart of the<br>
SDAnet experience.  Maybe when we encourage their presence<br>
in corporate and technological circles.<br>

I am a Ph.D. Student at Claremont Graduate School in California.<br>
<p>
I need to pilot test a survey that I am planning on using for my dissertation.<br>
<p>
 Can you help?<br>
<p>
I need a few people to agree to distribute this survey to 3-5 faculty at the<br>
college or university with which you  are affliated.  I will mail them to you<br>
with stamped addressed envelopes for each survey.  All I would ask you to do<br>
is hand the survey to five different people.<br>
<p>
Please write back via E-mail.<br>

Try using new feedback sources for your study.<br>
<p>
I myself used to have some years back some acquaintance, nonadventist <br>
friend whom I studied my Sabbath School lesson with on Friday night. It <br>
helps you te get new insights in the themes.<br>
<p>
One that I have been tempted to use i a network like this, to prepare <br>
the lessons, but there seems not to be enough time left ...<br>
<p>
Best regards<br>

[From Alan Swarm to me, a personal question that I thought might be <br>
interesting to others  SCT]<br>
I READ SO MANY MESAGES BY YOU ON THIS NET....WHAT IS YOUR EDUCATION?<br>
BACKGROUND, ETC.  POSITION AT ANDREWS BESIDES IN CHARGE OF THE NET....?<br>
THANKS FOR ANYTHING....<br>
<p>
I am a graduate student in particle physics at Carnegie Mellon <br>
University.  My only connection with Andrews is that I got my BA <br>
in physics and MS in Computer Science from there.  I have been a year <br>
away from finishing my Ph.D. for about a year now.  And most times,<br>
including now, I run SDAnet remotely from Fermilab in Batavia, IL. <br>

The impressionI got from the comments was that the author has an<br>
axe to grind but has some good evidence to present.  My view is that<br>
if he has an axe to grind you should also be suspicious of the way<br>
he presents the evidence.  One of my former SDA pastors once sent me a<br>
bunch of supposedly outlandish EGW quotes in an attempt to discredit her.<br>
On reflection, I found that the great majority of them were easy<br>
to explain.  HOwever, had I been weaker in faith, it could have<br>
led me to lose confidence inher prophetic gift altogether.  I'd<br>
encourage people to avoid biased sources unless they have a need to<br>
read them.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Marcus mentioned some time ago that EGW repeatedly used phrases like</i><br>
<i>&gt;"truth for this time".  The implication was that if it was truth for her</i><br>
<i>&gt;time it is not truth for our time, and further that this implication leads</i><br>
<i>&gt;naturally to the conclusion that much of the Bible was truth for the time</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;I am very uncomfortable with these conclusions etc etc</i><br>
<p>
I think one reason is that there is a leap of logic present here. I don't<br>
think the fact that prophets write "truth for their time" means that this<br>
truth is useless once "their time" has passed. As I said in a previous post<br>
myself, God being God and people being people, long-lasting principles are<br>
usually present in any inspired work.<br>
<p>
Although I am of the opinion that prophets always write for their own<br>
contemporaries, I do not agree that the implications Daniel mentions are<br>
a necessary extension of this.<br>
<p>
Unless he is suggesting that a person today should relate to the book of <br>
Corinthians in the same way that a worshipper in Corinth would have related <br>
to the letter at the time it was written. I do disagree with that approach.<br>

Last week our conference officers called a series of town meetings to <br>
discuss with the members the future of Broadview Academy.  Like many <br>
other SDA boarding academies, it has suffered declining enrollment over<br>
the past few years; it now has 125 students where there were 250<br>
a few years ago.  In a few years the cornfields around it  will all <br>
be part of Geneva, IL, complete with train station, subdivisions, strip<br>
malls, the works.  Land in that region is selling for several thousand <br>
dollars an acre.<br>
<p>
Broadview is different from some other SDA academies in several important<br>
ways.  Its reputation for academics has always been strong, and this is<br>
backed up by certification from the North Central Assn. of Colleges and <br>
Schools (which many SDA academies in this area don't have.)  Their campus <br>
industry is financially healthy and they could employ many more students <br>
than they have right now.  Also some students can work at an electronics<br>
plant just half a mile from the academy.  Broadview is easily accessible<br>
to the homes of students, being only 40 miles away from the lakefront<br>
of Chicago.<br>
<p>
Yet it seems that there are problems of perception of Broadview which <br>
have led to the declining enrollment.  Even as it is being swallowed by <br>
the metropolitan area the complaints are louder than ever that it is <br>
too far away.  Stronger than usual public schools in the suburbs of <br>
Chicago (home for many of the students) contribute to the idea that Broadview<br>
is weak academically (though some alumni of Broadview Academy on this very <br>
list might well dispute that).  <br>
<p>
Added to these are the real problems of a 30+year-old campus in which <br>
depreciation and maintainance have not been funded, and there is $1000000<br>
worth of asbestos to remove.  <br>
<p>
How can one fight against misperceptions?  The best cure for Broadview<br>
would be 100 more students, if this could happen.  Since there are <br>
almost 800 baptized SDA youth of academy age in the Chicago area alone,<br>
the potential population is certainly there.  30 students go to academies<br>
in other states and pay $1000/$2000 a year more, so money, although an<br>
object, is not the only object.  There are many parents who could send<br>
their kids anywhere they want who don't send them there.  They have judged<br>
the church school system which gave them their degree and got them rich<br>
to be not good enough for their kids.<br>
<p>
I have voiced the platitude that the church should be taking more interest<br>
in its youth who do not relate to the institutional system, and I am <br>
doing my best.  I teach a Sabbath school class of ten high-school aged<br>
young people, only one of whom is in church school (and he's not one of the <br>
pastor's kids, either).  What I can give them in a Sabbath School class <br>
is no substitute for what they could be getting in church school.  I am<br>
seeing some of them be drawn away from the church with extracurricular<br>
activities.  It seems that I am only one of the many childless boosters<br>
of Christian education. <br>
<p>
Though we are but five miles from the large "SDA" hospital in Hinsdale, IL,<br>
and but ten from the conference office, the institutional church has<br>
little or no effect on the young people of my church.  Some have never<br>
seen Broadview Academy or heard of Andrews University.<br>
<p>
How can this change?  Should it change?  If the Broadview Academy <br>
subsidy were to disappear, then there would be more than $400 to spend<br>
in the Illinois conference on youth ministry.  But for those that go to <br>
boarding school, it can be such an improvement over the home situation they <br>
are in that it is probably necessary to keep a boarding school open <br>
for that reason alone.<br>
<p>
Broadview Academy is not going to close, but its problems aren't going to<br>
go away anytime soon.  The school needs your prayers and ideas and kids <br>
(they can't hold on for 15-20 years to wait for mine.:)  Ideas?  thoughts?<br>

I'm sorry, I've not been keeping up my net reading...<br>
<p>
In mentioning that E. White used the phrase "truth for our time",<br>
I was not trying to make a broad, unquestionable statement<br>
of fact.  It was just a, "isn't this interesting, I wonder if it means<br>
anything?"  (Unfortunately, I didn't write it as such..., Social<br>
work teachers taught me better than to assume on or about<br>
other people.)....<br>
<p>
In short, I have not said or concluded anything re: "truth for our<br>
time."  Maybe other netfolk have.  I do suspect that there might<br>
be something to it.  What that "something" is... we might have<br>
to study.<br>

That's right!  We need to have our faith rest upon the Word of God that<br>
when we come into contact with these different sources, we know how to<br>

I've heard that Desmond Ford will be in Berrien Springs Middle School on<br>
the 25th and 26th of June.  I might go and listen, I have never heard him<br>
in person. , I first heard of him when I was in Washington DC in<br>
the 1980 or '81 that I saw the front page of Alexandria, VA paper of EGW's<br>
picture with the title "SDA Prophet, A Plagerist", and the disfellowship<br>
of Ford.  I haven't study much into his findings about the Sanctuary,<br>
but I will have my comment about it in the SDAnet later.<br>

Happy Sabbath everyone!<br>

Suggestions w.r.t. Broadview Academy:<br>
<p>
Is BA actively selling itself?  Part of the difficulty is that in the past<br>
SDA education survived solely on "cultural imperative to attend"; now it<br>
must seriously compete, and the system doesn't know how.<br>
<p>
Specific suggestions for Broadview, based on a brief visit out there last<br>
summer, when I was staying in a hotel on the Lakefront:<br>
<p>
1) Figure out where potential students actually live, and show every single<br>
   one of them exactly what the commuting options are: train, bus, EL, and<br>
   so on.  It really isn't very far from the Geneva station to Broadview,<br>
   which suggests that Broadview might want to run a shuttle service from<br>
   the station to the campus.  Train service is remarkably comfortable by<br>
   US standards; the number of folks who commute from Geneva-area suburbs<br>
   to all parts of the city is impressive, so why not promote the reverse<br>
   commute for school kids?  <br>
<p>
   This may mean adjusting BA's class schedule to accomodate trains, but<br>
   there's nothing sacred about 8am-2pm.<br>
<p>
2) After commuting by train, etc., for a year, many students might well<br>
   be enticed to just stay at the campus during the week.  Weekends, for<br>
   most, will be spent at home, which BA should figure out how to view as<br>
   a "good thing", and not a horrible thing.  (During my time at Rio Lindo<br>
   Academy in the mid-70's, weeknite-only boarders were strongly discouraged,<br>
   even when the kids lived a literal 100 yards from campus...)<br>
   Yes, its a different atmosphere, but it beats being out of business.<br>
<p>
3) Schools need to be more flexible with payment options, etc., and at the<br>
   same time uphold the right mix of standards based on principles.  BA is<br>
   just one of many schools that needs to recognize it is fighting for its<br>
   survival, even now.  Downward enrollment trends are enormously difficult<br>
   to counteract, even slow down.  Parents need to perceive that the school<br>
   is responsive to their problems/concerns, a rarity in the past.<br>
   Money and behavior are always at the top of the concerns list...<br>
<p>
4) Pay teachers to go out and recruit on weekends, holidays, etc.<br>
   Promote student-led recruitment activities at their home congregations.<br>
<p>
5) Sponsor parties, etc., at BA, targeting youth from various congregations<br>
   and bringing them out wholesale.  In other words, do whatever it takes<br>
   to develop the perception that BA is "the place" for high school<br>
   students to gather/meet/mix.<br>
<p>
6) Focus on the smaller congregations, which are more likely to be aware of<br>
   their youth, and willing to ante up the bucks as required.<br>
<p>
7) How can BA's strong academic program be advertised?  Where are their<br>
   recent graduates?  How many are in top-notch colleges?  What are alumni<br>
   doing career-wise?<br>
<p>
8) If the Geneva-area public schools are hot stuff, how can BA exploit that?<br>
   Joint field trips, etc.?  Public school bureaucrats are not generally<br>
   known for flexibility, but teachers are usually interested in anything<br>
   which will enhance the learning experience, and will often put out the<br>
   extra effort to make something fly.<br>
<p>
9) It won't be long before the suburbs surround BA.  What are the pros/cons<br>
   of that?  Whether they stay or not, BA should be actively involved in<br>
   county planning, etc.  For example, where is the train extension going<br>
   to run?  Should it be routed close to the school, or a long ways away?<br>
   Imagine the advertising plus if a train stop is 100 yds from the campus.<br>

Well, it's Friday afternoon again, and I'm sick of editing library records,<br>
so will chat a bit about SDA-net topics.  Steve, it was an interesting<br>
post, probably particularly for those of us employed by an SDA<br>
institution who have a vested interest in the outcome!  You raise issues<br>
that have been raised before, but which the corporate church seems<br>
reluctant to take decisive action.  The U.S. Congress isn't the only<br>
place of political gridlock.  The SDA church as in institution has many<br>
vested interests and geographical and political boundaries which are<br>
zealously defended.  In the Lake Union, I believe you would find Indiana<br>
and Wisconsin academies to be in not an appeciably different position<br>
from Broadview.<br>
<p>
First, I think your conference administration is wise to have town hall<br>
meetings to gather information and input.  Let's hope they're sincerely<br>
listening.  There can seldom be too much communication, and often is too<br>
little.  For the students going elsewhere, you need to find out why.<br>
Talk to the parents and students.  From things I've heard, you may have<br>
an administrative problem at Broadview.  Don't be defensive, but find<br>
out if that's really the case.  You will never please everyone, and it's<br>
good to have alternatives for those who you can't please.  Better that<br>
they go outside the Illinois Conference than to public school.  Focus<br>
group meetings are often a valuable source of information.  <br>
<p>
Somehow many church members no longer have a feeling of "ownership" of<br>
the institutions (this might also apply to the "SDA" health care<br>
institution(s) you mentioned).  Where there are problems, we need to<br>
find ways to work together toward resolution.<br>
<p>
However, I think other factors are at work also.  Many people of my<br>
generation seem infected with the disease of "yuppiedom."  As you noted,<br>
while receiving their education at SDA institutions, it's not "good<br>
enough" for their children.  There are faculty members of Andrews<br>
University who send their children to secular undergraduate institutions<br>
for this reason, and there are many other professionals who do the same.<br>
It would be really interesting to know if they really feel that their<br>
education was inferior.  I have two degrees from Andrews, and a degree<br>
from the University of North Carolina.  I don't feel there was any<br>
overall difference in the quality of education (though to read<br>
"rankings" you would certainly think so).  I had good and poor classes<br>
and teachers at both.  I would say that I should have had a class in<br>
philosophy at Andrews (we're too busy teaching religion to require<br>
that), and more exposure to the great books.  I do not feel I was inadequately<br>
prepared for graduate school or was at a disadvantage.  I wonder how<br>
others feel (including those who send their children elsewhere).<br>
Graduates with good grades from SDA colleges appear to have no difficulty<br>
in being accepted and doing well in top-grade graduate and professional<br>
schools (including Carnegie-Mellon, Steve!).<br>
<p>
There seems to be more going on here.  For one thing, when you really<br>
dig down, in some cases it's a matter of priorities.  Families would<br>
rather have a nicer car/house/you fill in the blank than pay tuition<br>
(though this would not apply to other private schools, which, believe it<br>
or not, might be even higher than ours!).  There seems also to be<br>
something of an obsession with status--the appearance of quality.<br>
Perhaps this is a side effect of a society saturated with marketing<br>
ploys.  Many, many times a year I see students (including ones right off<br>
the plane from overseas who can only speak minimal English) come to the<br>
library for the lists of colleges, including those sources that purport<br>
to "rank" them (that's another topic, which I won't get into here).<br>
It's like--I want to drive a BMW and send my kid to Harvard.  My cousin<br>
(WWC and LLU grad) certainly did that.  Perhaps the parents'<br>
relationship with the church is tenuous enough that they really don't<br>
care if there kids have one or not.  It's hard to say.<br>
<p>
I have seen weak programs continue because of administrative<br>
unwillingness to make the necessary changes.  It is also highly unlikely<br>
that the SDA church has the human or financial resources to operate the<br>
number of institutions that it has at a high performance level.  But the<br>
political structure is such that it would take a major national<br>
dislocation to change it, I'm afraid.  It's not like GM deciding to<br>
eliminate its least efficient facilities.  But the "weak sisters" help<br>
drag everyone down by taking resources that are needed to build better<br>
offerings elsewhere.<br>
<p>
In closing, we probably need to do a better job both of performance and<br>
of marketing (in its positive sense).  Many times, we don't even know<br>
who the market is.<br>

I'm sorry to see you go, Sue.  I hope you come back soon.  I have<br>
appreciated your postings, including your goodbye.  Please don't believe<br>
that all the male members of the list believe we have a God-given right<br>
to be "head" of women, and at least some of us do believe in the ordination<br>
of women.  [I have known Merikay since the heady days of the Pacific<br>
Press lawsuit--I grew up in Mtn. View as the child of a "Presstitute"!]<br>
I would also like to see more female participation in this list, and in<br>
fact have called for it a time or two!  I also suggest to colleages,<br>
male and female, that they might enjoy the list (and I believe I have<br>
talked some into it).<br>
<p>
Now for some speculation (it's Friday afternoon, remember?) about why<br>
the list is male oriented.  I think there are a number of reasons.  I<br>
suspect that perhaps more men than women presently have access to the<br>
requisite equipment.  I have noticed that a number of members are<br>
employees of computer-related companies.  Are the majority of employees<br>
at such places male?  Do more males have access to computers in the<br>
workplace than females?  Perhaps not since the advent of word-processing.<br>
Do women with computers have equal access to networks?  On this campus,<br>
I think the ratio of men and women with network access is dramatically<br>
changing with the installation of a campus-wide network.  Just yesterday<br>
I gave a training session for Seminary faculty and staff of Internet<br>
resources available via telnet.  I believe more secretaries came than<br>
"men" (unfortunately, I believe Nancy Vyhmeister remains the only female<br>
seminary faculty member--though she may also still be the only net<br>
member--good for you, Nancy).  Many males in power (including the<br>
president of this university) seem to think that computers (like<br>
typewriters) are for women.  Recently I saw my rich cousin at graduation<br>
and asked him if I could communicate via e-mail.  He didn't know his address--that was something his secretary did.<br>
<p>
I think there's something of a "boys with the toys" element with<br>
computers (outside word processing).  We certainly see this with<br>
stereos.  Recently there was a discussion of why most expensive stereo<br>
owners and CD collectors were male (this was in a stereo magazine).  For<br>
some reason, it seems to be a male compulsion.  Is it possible that some<br>
men have an easier time communicating "with a machine" than with real<br>
people?  Having worked closely with computing types over the last year,<br>
I would say human communication ability was not a strong point with many<br>
(fortunately, perhaps, the one who I worked with most closely is female<br>
and has been easy to communicate with).  Perhaps many women, even those<br>
with access, have other priorities in their lives.  Perhaps they feel<br>
they don't have time.  Perhaps the topics don't interest them--too much<br>
religion an politics perhaps.  At social events, men and women often separate<br>
and talk about quite different things.  This list hasn't had a lot of<br>
flames, but that could be a deterrent also.<br>
<p>
I believe as an institution the church needs to make a conscious decision<br>
to include women in decsion-making positions and roles.  Working in a<br>
profession with many females shows me quite clearly that men and women<br>
can work together quite harmoniously in reaching common objectives<br>
(though there still seem to be a disproportionate number of men in the<br>
"higher" positions).  <br>
<p>
It seems to me that gender roles are going through a period of<br>
tremendous change, not only the relationship of men and women, but<br>
groups of men and women.  The notions of feminine and masculine are<br>
changing, and that means both men and women.  I have read a number of<br>
recent books on "men's studies," and have found them useful.  Rather<br>
than being anti-female, they are trying to redefine masculinity.  It<br>
seems to me that men and women need both their own space and shared<br>
space, and working these spaces out in an egalatarian way without being<br>
discriminatory.  We will all have to change.  Some groups of men have<br>
ruled over others as well as over women.  The hierarchy (patriarchy, if<br>
you will) is more complex than just men and women.  Techniques of<br>
control and manipulation used by some women (I won't get too specific<br>
here) also need to change.<br>
<p>
I recently heard a report on National Public Radio about women<br>
scientists that indicated that most of them had attended female<br>
colleges.  I certainly feel that there is room in our society for such,<br>
though I would hope that women can achieve their full potential  in our<br>
coed schools as well.  Some interests and tendencies just seem to be<br>
inborn.  My mother and sister tried very hard to interest my son in<br>
dolls.  My daugher later adopted them all.  I have noticed that while my<br>
son and nephew are playing computer, my daugher and neice tend to stay<br>
away, but when the boys leave, the girls happily play with it.  I'm<br>
trying hard to make sure they have equal opportunity (perhaps I should<br>
also say that I need equal opportunity!).  When my daugher says she'd<br>
like to be a teacher (like Mom and Grandma), I also encourage her to<br>
think about doctor and scientist.  We shall see.<br>
<p>
Good luck, Sue, and God bless.<br>

I can't agree with Dan Gill that no one should own a TV.  However, I do<br>
believe that the TV shouldn't own you!  I think I was fortunate that my<br>
parents didn't buy a TV until I was a junior in high school.  By that<br>
time I had found many other ways to use my time than watch TV.  The<br>
public library was only 4 blocks away, and I used it a lot (probably had<br>
something to do with my present profession!).  I do feel handicapped,<br>
however, when playing trivial pursuit type games (or watching Jeopardy!)<br>
because I don't know anything about Gilligan's Island, or whatever!<br>
&lt;grin&gt;<br>
<p>
I do own a TV now because I do have enough time to watch just a bit<br>
(usually time-shifting so I can skip the ads!).  As a reference<br>
librarian, it is useful to know what's in the news.  Believe it or not,<br>
I do enjoy an occasional PBS show (usually Masterpiece Theatre).  On<br>
cable, I find the weather channel useful in planning my day.  Other than<br>
that I've made a little deal with myself--I watch TV and Nordic Trak at<br>
the same time.  It helps increase the exercise and decrease the TV.  I<br>
only watch something like Jeopardy! while I'm tracking.<br>
<p>
I have had to limit the kids' TV.  My son would rather read or play<br>
computer games (an equally potentially insidiously compulsive activity),<br>
but my daughter is in danger of becoming a TV-aholic.  After she<br>
disregarded our summer TV rules, I simply disconnected the cable and<br>
locked up a crucial connection.  She needs to learn to read first.<br>
<p>
As in reading or anything else we do, I think we need to use TV with<br>
discretion.<br>

According to Dan Crowe:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Marcus mentioned some time ago that EGW repeatedly used phrases like</i><br>
<i>&gt; "truth for this time".  The implication was that if it was truth for her</i><br>
<i>&gt; time it is not truth for our time, and further that this implication leads</i><br>
<i>&gt; naturally to the conclusion that much of the Bible was truth for the time</i><br>
<i>&gt; at which it was written but is no longer truth for our time.</i><br>
<p>
Dan,<br>
<p>
I didn't get the impression that Marcus implied any such thing (something<br>
which he confirmed in a later post).  Nor did I receive that impression<br>
from EGW.<br>
<p>
What I do gather from EGW is a truth which was taught by Paul in 1 Cor.<br>
13: namely, truth (or the relevance of truth) will pass away (1 Cor.<br>
13:8-13).  Only love is eternal.<br>
<p>
This is NOT to say that prophetic words (e.g., the Bible) are meaningless. <br>
Indeed, we are taught that the historical events recorded were designed to<br>
serve as examples for us (1 Cor. 10:6,10), to keep us from setting our<br>
hearts on sinful things.<br>
<p>
Obviously, if we pass on to Heaven, the Biblical admonitions will cease to<br>
have quite the same eternal-life-or-eternal-damnation consequences which<br>
they do in this probationary life.  (Note please, that I am NOT saying we<br>
can do whatever we want in Heaven since, after all, the Law will always be<br>
in effect.  I am merely recognizing that since we would be finally separated<br>
from the influence of the evil one, it becomes so much easier to do the<br>
Father's Will.)   The principles which the prophets have labored to teach us<br>
will have become second nature.<br>
<p>
Nevertheless, there are particular issues which the church must address<br>
that were not prevalent issues in the distant (Biblical) past; AIDS,<br>
thermo-nuclear warfare, black-white-Oriental-female prejudice etc.  Even though<br>
Biblical principles cover all of these, at times we apparently have<br>
difficulties mapping the Biblically recorded events into our present situations.<br>
<p>
As a classic example of this, Jesus addressed the evil of discrimination<br>
for all time when He treated the Samaritan woman by Jacob's well (John<br>
4:1-42) like she was a fellow Jew to the surprise of His apostles as<br>
they returned from buying food (John 4:27).   As EGW reported in The Desire of<br>
Ages,<br>
<p>
	"The Jews and Samaritans were bitter enemies, and as far as possible<br>
	avoided all dealing with each other.  To trade with the Samaritans in<br>
	case of necessity was indeed counted lawful by the rabbis; but all<br>
	social intercourse with them was condemned.  A Jew would not borrow<br>
	from a Samaritan, nor receive a kindness, not even a morsel of bread or<br>
	a cup of water.  The disciples, in buying food, were acting in harmony<br>
	with the custom of their nation.  But beyond this they did not go.  To<br>
	ask a favor of the Samaritans, or in any way seek to benefit them, did<br>
	not enter into the thought of even Christ's disciples."<br>
<p>
Still, Jesus asked the Samaritan woman for water; an act which was most<br>
decidedly unJewish and unSamaritan-ish alike.<br>
<p>
I find it difficult for we white, black, Oriental, Jew, Non-Jew, rich, poor,<br>
heterosexual, homosexual, male, female, SDA, non SDA (or any other<br>
manifestation of bigotry) bigots to read this and not see ourselves.  Yet the<br>
subtle and not-so-subtle hatred exhibited all in the name of God whenever<br>
topics such as homosexuality, masculine dominance, and the like are broached<br>
seems to indicate that the lesson demonstrated by Jesus was not learned, that<br>
we have yet to map this truth about a specific manifestation of one sin to all<br>
manifestations of that sin.<br>
<p>
There are no longer any Samaritans for us to scratch our prejudicial claws<br>
on, so that specific truth is no more.  However, the greater principle<br>
(i.e., truth) of loving others who are different from us, of accentuating our<br>
similarities and common needs rather than our disparities remains.<br>
<p>
Some have attempted to address this using the oft-quoted phrase "hate the sin,<br>
but love the sinner".  Certainly, the phrase is NOT incorrect!  Unfortunately,<br>
I'm afraid that phrase has gone the path of most oft-quoted phrases where it<br>
is used so often that it loses relevance for the listener, becoming an<br>
ideological plant vainly attempting to flourish without any contextual roots.<br>
<p>
Paul teaches us that love is the greatest gift of the Spirit and the only one<br>
required for us to take before gaining entry to the Kingdom (1 Cor. 13).  In<br>
the same discourse, he also teaches that the lesser gifts are no substitute<br>
for love, that the lesser gifts, indeed, have no Divine meaning apart from<br>
love (1 Cor. 13:1-3).<br>
<p>
In the light of the above, may I not-so-humbly propose a corollary to the<br>
"truth for our times" phrasing:<br>
<p>
	Truth (as well as any lesser gift) has no Divine meaning unless it<br>
	is seasoned with Divinely-inspired love.<br>
<p>
(If perchance this phrase becomes oft-quoted enough, it shall probably too<br>
become an ideological plant without roots!)<br>
<p>
What this implies is that we are not use the Bible like a mindless,<br>
Bible-quoting parrot to condemn those stuck in unpopular sins (e.g.,<br>
homosexuality) or to exalt ourselves to a status not sanctioned by the Bible<br>
(e.g., male dominance).<br>
<p>
In the less-than two years that I have been a SDA-ist (having defected<br>
successively from a number of other churches), I must say that Adventists are<br>
the most conceited Christians I have ever met.  We love to brag about being<br>
the "church of truth", yet we suffer from the same sins which afflict other<br>
denominations (including non-denominational entities, whatever those are).  <br>
This makes us all the more worse since we have received more Light than the<br>
others and, consequently, have inherited a greater responsibility to<br>
demonstrate the Love of the Godhead in our lives.  It profits us nothing to be<br>
able to quote the Bible backwards and forwards if we cannot apply It to our<br>
lives and problems.<br>
<p>
I had better close for now as I feel a preaching fit threatening to overwhelm<br>
me.  (Can't you see that I am doing my Father's work?)<br>

This is the eulogy for fellow netter Dennis Grumbling, given by a<br>
professional colleague at the funeral.  It had been posted to a library<br>
listserv, and I asked if it could also be distributed to SDA-Net.<br>

<i>&gt; Harvey,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm delighted to provide you with a copy, thanks for taking care of SDA</i><br>
<i>&gt; net for me. Heidi is in Berrien, so I wouldn't have gotten to it till</i><br>
<i>&gt; she got back. Please feel free to disseminate it to whoever would want</i><br>
<i>&gt; it. I'm compelled to point out that I'm not Adventist, so it may not</i><br>
<i>&gt; meet Adventist doctrinal standards there at the end. The Gaelic poem was</i><br>
<i>&gt; chosen because Heidi spent time in Scotland, and I thought it would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaningful for her. It came from a book of old Gaelic prayers and blessings</i><br>
<i>&gt; put out by a Christian press in Edinburgh.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dennis and I were quite close, and delivering his eulogy is one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardest things I have ever had to do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yours, Debbie</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ***********************************</i><br>
<i>&gt; In Memoriam  Dennis Grumling 1959-1993</i><br>
<i>&gt; Eulogy delivered at memorial service, June 14, 1993</i><br>
<i>&gt; ****************************************************</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd like to tell you a little about Dennis' background, then talk a bit</i><br>
<i>&gt; about how much he meant to those of us who knew him as a colleague.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dennis Grumling was a minister's child, the son of Alvin and Mary Grumbling.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He was born in Stockton, CA, June 27, 1959, so he would have been 35 at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the end of this month. He had one older brother, Gary.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; His parents moved around a lot, as clergy families do. He went to high</i><br>
<i>&gt; school in Newark, Ohio. He began his college degree at Johns Hopkins</i><br>
<i>&gt; University in 1976, and attended there two years on a National Merit </i><br>
<i>&gt; Scholarship, but when we changed his major to Theology he transferred to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ashland College and graduated from there in 1980. Later that year he </i><br>
<i>&gt; entered Andrews University's M.Div. program. He took a year off in 1981</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be assistant pastor of the Worthington, Ohio Seventh Day Adventist</i><br>
<i>&gt; Church, then returned to the seminary in 1982-83 to finish his degree.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Although his experiences in the pastorate eventually led him to conclude</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it was not the career for him, he remained active in the church as</i><br>
<i>&gt; an Elder and played an important role in providing support for new members</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the church. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the fall of 1983, he entered the Library School at Indiana University,</i><br>
<i>&gt; where he was awarded the M.L.S. and elected to the library honor society</i><br>
<i>&gt; Beta Phi Mu in 1984.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; On June 17, 1984, he and Heidi Vyhmeister married. They went to Puerto</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rico on mission at Antillian College later in 1984, where Dennis was </i><br>
<i>&gt; head of Technical Services at the library until they came to Chicago</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Dec. 1986. In Puerto Rico he learned to snorkel, a passion that stayed</i><br>
<i>&gt; with him all his life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In January 1987 he entered the PhD program at the now closed Graduate</i><br>
<i>&gt; Library School of the University of Chicago, on a full tuition scholarship.</i><br>
<i>&gt; He was two chapters from the end of his dissertation at the time of his</i><br>
<i>&gt; death.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; His professional specialty was cataloging, which is the art of putting</i><br>
<i>&gt; information away so that reference librarians like me can find it again</i><br>
<i>&gt; when somebody asks for it. His professional life was extremely active</i><br>
<i>&gt; and varied. In addition to working as a cataloger at Antillian, University</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Illinois - Chicago, and DePaul, he did a lot of consulting. Many of </i><br>
<i>&gt; you probably aren't aware that much of his programming work was done for</i><br>
<i>&gt; community programs serving indigents, and he donated a lot of his time or</i><br>
<i>&gt; worked as substantially reduced consulting rates. He also did a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt; consulting for Adventist mission churches overseas, acting as a resource</i><br>
<i>&gt; for those often isolated librarians. He was librarian and programmer to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mortimer Adler of the Institute for Philosophical Research, and while</i><br>
<i>&gt; there worked on the last revision of the Great Books Series. He taught</i><br>
<i>&gt; cataloging at Indiana U's Gary campus, and participated in the Professional</i><br>
<i>&gt; Development Program run by academic libraries here in Chicago. He was active</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the American Society for Information Science, the Association of Seventh</i><br>
<i>&gt; Day Adventist Librarians, and the American Library Association. At the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time of his death, he was Book Review editor for the professional journal</i><br>
<i>&gt; Cataloging and Classification Quarterly, and was head of the Cataloging</i><br>
<i>&gt; Department at DePaul University's Library.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Those are the basics. I could also add that he was honest, trustworthy,</i><br>
<i>&gt; loyal, brave, and loving, but it begins to sound like a Scout Oath, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; none of what I've said so far really tells you anything about why those</i><br>
<i>&gt; of us who were in library school with him and worked with him loved him</i><br>
<i>&gt; so. The way he enriched my life will probably strike a chord among many</i><br>
<i>&gt; of you, so I'd like to talk a little about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dennis and I were the last two PhD students admitted to the Graduate</i><br>
<i>&gt; Library School, and we got caught in the pipeline as it closed. Because</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other doctoral students were far ahead of us in the program, and far</i><br>
<i>&gt; from us geographically, we became close friends. It's a lot like being</i><br>
<i>&gt; two soldiers in a foxhole; you either come to love or to hate the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; person in the foxhole.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We sat glazy-eyed through the same courses and complained about professors' </i><br>
<i>&gt; expectations. Once we started working in libraries, we joked about mounting</i><br>
<i>&gt; a hostile takeover of some academic library, since between us we felt we</i><br>
<i>&gt; had the reference and technical services skills to run it "right." We read</i><br>
<i>&gt; each other's proposals and papers, a process always referred to as</i><br>
<i>&gt; "trashing," our code word for the ruthless editing we felt we owed each</i><br>
<i>&gt; other's work. Though time consuming, it was always fun because Dennis </i><br>
<i>&gt; possessed a wit as sharp as his editing pencil, and we never failed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; enjoy the jokes and absurdities that doctoral students and academics</i><br>
<i>&gt; everywhere must endure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Most important, however, we provided a safety net of emotional support</i><br>
<i>&gt; for each other in situations that ranged from academic frustrations to</i><br>
<i>&gt; problems at work to attending each other's sessions at conferences so</i><br>
<i>&gt; we'd be assured of ONE friendly face (and where we'd turn each other's</i><br>
<i>&gt; overheads and make faces when the audience couldn't see, in an attempt</i><br>
<i>&gt; to reduce tension for whichever of us was facing the audience.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is no greater love that one doctoral student can have for another,</i><br>
<i>&gt; than to hold the hand of that colleague before a dissertation proposal</i><br>
<i>&gt; defense at the University of Chicago. That's the BIG one, the defense </i><br>
<i>&gt; where your work can be stalled forever due to real or perceived problems</i><br>
<i>&gt; (or the mood of the faculty that day.) For about four weeks before our</i><br>
<i>&gt; respective ordeals, we were simply impossible to live with -- ask our</i><br>
<i>&gt; spouses! Only your foxhold buddy will put up with you during something</i><br>
<i>&gt; like that, because he knows exactly what you are going through. We both</i><br>
<i>&gt; defended successfully, and celebrated with the chocolate he loved so</i><br>
<i>&gt; much.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And now he's gone. And there's a big emotional hole in my life. And there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is one for all of us who knew we could call Dennis and get an answer</i><br>
<i>&gt; to questions like, "How do I get this file to print right?" or "How</i><br>
<i>&gt; do I catalog THIS thing?" or even just "I'm having a bad day -- got any</i><br>
<i>&gt; chocolate?"  We miss him now, and we will keep on missing him, even after</i><br>
<i>&gt; the sharp pain of loss has faded to the gentle grief that the passage of</i><br>
<i>&gt; time brings to those left behind. This old Gaelic blessing may bring us</i><br>
<i>&gt; comfort, reminding us that both birth and death are important to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever-renewing cycle of life:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 			As it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; 		 	As it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; 			As it shall be</i><br>
<i>&gt; 			Evermore,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 			O Thou Triune of Grace!</i><br>
<i>&gt; 			With the ebb,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 			With the flow,</i><br>
<i>&gt; 			O Thou Triune of Grace!</i><br>
<i>&gt; 			With the ebb</i><br>
<i>&gt; 			With the flow.</i><br>

I'd like to spend a thought or two discussing how it is that a certain <br>
thought comes to be perceived as truth by a person or a group of people.<br>
This relates to several of the discussions we have had lately.  (Note,<br>
I'm not a Greek scholar, but I study about lots of particles with fancy <br>
Greek names :))<br>
<p>
Pathos, as I understand it, deals with the domain of the feelings and <br>
emotions.  This is the gut-level emotional "yes" that comes with the <br>
conviction of truth, and is part of faith and the conversion experience<br>
whether we would like to think so or not.  Believing in God necessarily<br>
requires pathos.  (As does believing in [no God]).<br>
<p>
Logos is the Word (and in the context of the Bible, the word of God).<br>
It is the Word that gives us guidance as to what to believe about God<br>
and how to believe in God.  Pathos without reference to Logos is bound<br>
to go astray.<br>
<p>
Ethos deals with the set of ethics:  what is right and wrong, and why.<br>
Most Christians believe this too should be rooted in the Logos.<br>
<p>
When cognitive dissonance occurs, it's often due to the fact that one<br>
is convicted with _pathos_ that the current interpretation of logos <br>
and ethos is wrong.  To those who do not share the life experience or the<br>
background and feelings of this person, they do not and cannot see the<br>
moral imperative to change that is based on pathos.  Furthermore, they<br>
only see the pathos and often have difficulties understanding the <br>
underlying logos and ethos, if any, that drives the demand of this <br>
person.  <br>
<p>
How can people who feel there is a moral imperative communicate their<br>
logos and ethos to the SDA church as a whole?  Or should they have to do<br>
this?  Is "I feel that this action is right and therefore we must accept<br>
it"<br>
enough?<br>
<p>

Yesterday afternoon (Sabbath) I was fellowshipping with some of my church<br>
family when a sister, a mother of a four-year-old boy, asked a question about <br>
children playing on Sabbath.  We began a study of the chapter "Sabbath -<br>
The Day of Delight" in Child Guidance (pp. 527-37).  I had never read this<br>
chapter before.  I highly recommend that all Adventists who have contact<br>
with children on Sabbath read this chapter.<br>
<p>
To summarize the main conclusions, EGW advises us to spend time on<br>
Sabbath with our children, especially studying God's goodness as expressed<br>
in nature.  They should not be left to play secular games on Sabbath.<br>
I plan to modify my Sabbath activities with my six-year-old son.<br>

I haven't commented for the week, but I can't help expressing my<br>
agreement with Harvey and John on their observations.<br>
<p>
Well said!  God help us to search for the gems of truth that reside<br>
in the Bible and the SOP, rather than try to find exact examples of<br>
every situation.  The apostles were absolutely clear on racial and<br>
gender equality: " we are all one in Christ Jesus - male, female,<br>
servant (slave), free-man, Jew (Christian) or Gentile (non-Christian).<br>
<p>
The message of the Christianity is:  Love conquers all!  i.e ALL!<br>
<p>
I never met Dennis (not even on SDAnet as I am a "neophyte"), but I<br>
certainly plan to meet him in the kingdom.<br>
<p>
I had the good fortune to be introduced to Sue at AUC a few weeks ago.<br>
God Bless you as you pursue other goals.  I'll be praying for you.<br>

Netters,<br>
<p>
Richard had some suggestions concerning BVA, and being an alumnus of<br>
Broadview I felt that some comments should be made concerning those<br>
suggestions.  Of course not having really been active around BVA since<br>
1991 (the year my youngest brother graduated from BVA), the information<br>
stated herein may be inaccurate.  But was accurate up until at least 1990.<br>
<p>
On Fri, 18 Jun 1993, Richard Guy wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Suggestions w.r.t. Broadview Academy:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is BA actively selling itself?  Part of the difficulty is that in the past</i><br>
<i>&gt; SDA education survived solely on "cultural imperative to attend"; now it</i><br>
<i>&gt; must seriously compete, and the system doesn't know how.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
	First let me say, before I went to BVA, and up until my graduation, <br>
they actively recruited among the churches and church schools in Illinois. <br>
Since my graduation I have no idea if they are still recruiting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) Figure out where potential students actually live, and show every single</i><br>
<i>&gt;    one of them exactly what the commuting options are: train, bus, EL, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;    so on.  It really isn't very far from the Geneva station to Broadview,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    which suggests that Broadview might want to run a shuttle service from</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the station to the campus.  Train service is remarkably comfortable by</i><br>
<i>&gt;    US standards; the number of folks who commute from Geneva-area suburbs</i><br>
<i>&gt;    to all parts of the city is impressive, so why not promote the reverse</i><br>
<i>&gt;    commute for school kids?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;    This may mean adjusting BA's class schedule to accomodate trains, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;    there's nothing sacred about 8am-2pm.</i><br>
<p>
	Well, being a BVA alum (and proud of it),  I must say this would<br>
be a very _large_ problem.  Extra-curricular activities such as band,<br>
gymnastics and choir are at the extreme ends of the class schedule<br>
(starting at 6:45 a.m. for band and 5:00 p.m. for gym &amp; choir).  I haven't<br>
seen a schedule lately, but the schedule hasn't changed much in many<br>
years.  Also, having a schedule like Richard suggests would cause havoc on<br>
the work schedules of the students.  I mean its those working dollars from<br>
industries which come from outside the church which have helped keep the <br>
school on somewhat better ground than a lot of other academies.  Being<br>
able to count on labor to help pay my tuition was a great thing to have<br>
considering my parents really couln't afford to pay for my "academy<br>
experience."  But if you're planning on just catering to the "well off"<br>
then by all means go ahead with an 8-3 schedule.  But the majority of<br>
young people that went to BVA when I attended were not rich, although<br>
there were always those few who were.  If I remember correctly, though,<br>
there were a lot of kids that were there from broken homes &amp; other unique<br>
situations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) Schools need to be more flexible with payment options, etc., and at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    same time uphold the right mix of standards based on principles.  BA is</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
	Amen!  It seems that the same thing needs to go for the Universities &amp;<br>
hospitals in the Adventist system as well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4) Pay teachers to go out and recruit on weekends, holidays, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Promote student-led recruitment activities at their home congregations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
	Hey, why not pay students as well. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 6) Focus on the smaller congregations, which are more likely to be aware of</i><br>
<i>&gt;    their youth, and willing to ante up the bucks as required.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
	I don't know about your church, but the "small" congregation that<br>
I came from pretty much only focused on the adults &amp; children.  The teens<br>
&amp; young adults were pretty much left to their own devices.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 9) It won't be long before the suburbs surround BA.  What are the pros/cons</i><br>
<i>&gt;    of that?  Whether they stay or not, BA should be actively involved in</i><br>
<i>&gt;    county planning, etc.  For example, where is the train extension going</i><br>
<i>&gt;    to run?  Should it be routed close to the school, or a long ways away?</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Imagine the advertising plus if a train stop is 100 yds from the campus.</i><br>
<p>
	Actually the railroad already runs 200 yards from the academy's<br>
entrance.  Currently, however, there are no passenger trains that go beyond<br>
Geneva on those tracks.  I think it would be a great idea to have the train<br>
go as far as BVA, even if it was only 2 or 3 times each day.  It would not<br>
just be a great way to comute to school, but also for parents to come and take<br>
part in some of the activities or even Sabbath School and Church.<br>
<p>
<p>
Anyway, that is how I remember things being at BVA.  If this adds to the<br>
discussion, then great, if not, life will go on.<br>

As one of the minority 17 women on this net, I must say<br>
that my absence from many discussions on SDAnet is a result<br>
of very practical reasons: I am very busy concentrating on<br>
an intense doctoral program and am now studying for my<br>
comprehensive exams in July (Prayers, please!!). It has<br>
been a lack of time, not a lack of iterest in the technological<br>
or political topics discussed here. <br>
<p>
Before I heard of the net, sought it out and subscribed, I<br>
was a lonely graduate student missing very much a link to<br>
intellectually stimulating discussions about church-related<br>
issues. SDAnet has filled a big empty spot in my life and has<br>
been my link to the church for two years. I am very grateful.<br>
<p>
It has been a traumatic time in my academic career. My<br>
dissertation topic has been in jeopardy from faculty and<br>
from other students despite my discretion about discussing<br>
it. As a result, I have testified before faculty affairs<br>
committee, met with graduate officials, etc. The University<br>
has been very supportive throughout this ordeal. Being on<br>
this side of academic plagarism gives one a very compelling<br>
view of the ethics of plagarism. <br>
<p>
Thus, self-censorship regarding posting to the net has been<br>
a matter of priorities despite the fact that I have had much<br>
to say about the public relations activities and lack thereof<br>
during this fascinating time of Koresh. <br>
<p>
Thanks to Steve and the other members of the net for keeping<br>
the discussions (heated and otherwise) on the net. It is one<br>
of the ONLY places in Adventism where this kind of open<br>
dialog can be found and I am grateful.<br>

Dear fellow net members,<br>
<p>
I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed reading Friday's SDAnet<br>
mail. There have been times during my year-or-so on SDAnet when I have felt<br>
as though I have all-too-little in common with "good" SDAs, and when I have<br>
felt discouraged by it all, but these times are balanced out by other instances<br>
where I feel some weird sense of companionship. With people I haven't even met!!<br>
<p>
So to Fred, Harvey, John, and all the rest of you, thanks for taking the time<br>
to share how you feel. I for one, and I think I speak for most of us, do<br>
appreciate the fellowship.<br>
<p>

<p>
I have also had the one where my head tells me that my current<br>
position is inconsistent or incorrect, but my heart tells me it's right.<br>
<p>
Both these forms of cognitive dissonance are difficult to deal with as a<br>
Christian. Even before you try to convince anyone else, you have to have it<br>
sorted out for yourself! My problem has often been related to confusion over<br>
how the Holy Spirit works. On the one hand, some tell me that "higher<br>
education" and "higher criticism" are damaging to my faith, and cannot help<br>
me discern spiritual truth. Then others use debates and points of logic to<br>
show why such and such is the correct understanding. Does the Holy Spirit<br>
move the heart, the head, or both? Is he usually a "still, small voice"<br>
distinguishing right from wrong, or a dove moving upon the soul? If this<br>
question had a once-for-all answer, then logos/pathos dissonance would be<br>
easy to resolve. Providing the still small voice always spoke up!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How can people who feel there is a moral imperative communicate their</i><br>
<i>&gt;logos and ethos to the SDA church as a whole?  Or should they have to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;this?  Is "I feel that this action is right and therefore we must accept</i><br>
<i>&gt;it" enough?</i><br>
<p>
I like to see open communication occur in such a situation. "I feel that this<br>
action is right, but I cannot explain why. What do you think?", maybe. An<br>
attempt to convey the concrete thoughts behind the feeling is usually<br>
worthwhile, even if it is impossible to give all the experiences leading up<br>
to those thoughts.<br>

Thank you for sharing both your knowledge and your feelings for<br>
your friend.  I now feel that I share your loss, and so the eulogy<br>
was as "successful" as such a communication can be.<br>

After having read both Richard's and Michael's postings to the net (and<br>
having also talked to Michael--it is handy he works in the same<br>
building!), I have a few more comments/questions about Broadview<br>
Academy.  They center around whether or not BVA wishes to become in part<br>
or even in its entirely a commuting school.<br>
<p>
I went to Mtn. View Academy, a day school in California.  For all of its<br>
history (and it's now 70 years old) it has drawn commuting students from<br>
San Francisco, San Jose and elsewhere.  Many of these came by Southern<br>
Pacific commuter train.  A typical day for a SF student was to get up<br>
very early (5-ish), get a bus to the train station, and take the train<br>
down the Peninsula, picking up additional students along the way from<br>
places like Burlingame and meeting the students coming north at the old<br>
Mtn. View train station and walking the 5-7 blocks to the school.  They<br>
then reversed the process in the evening.  At least they could study on<br>
the train.  Others came by auto and bus from much of the Bay Area.  A<br>
long day for many of them, to say the least (I was lucky enough to live<br>
3 blocks from the school).  Unfortunately, Mtn. View Academy has also<br>
fallen on hard times, partially due to the exodus of the Pacific Press<br>
and the conference office to cheaper locales (there are some<br>
disadvantages to being squarely in the middle of "Silicon Valley"--I<br>
really can't stand that name for my native Santa Clara Valley, but<br>
that's another story!).  This mix of students worked quite well for MVA<br>
partly because all of the students were day students.  I would add that<br>
many of these students were from ethnic groups that enhanced the<br>
diversity of the school.  They also had a 10-grade school in SF, so at<br>
least the younger students didn't have the long commute (although those<br>
from Burlingame did).<br>
<p>
One issue would be, Is it possible to successfully mix large contingents<br>
of day and boarding students.  In the past, many boarding schools<br>
(Monterey Bay, for example) tried hard to avoid this.  As Michael<br>
mentioned, running a "split schedule" for the sake of the industries<br>
does not work well with day students, although solutions might be found.<br>
I believe social issues also contributed to this.  I suspect it would be<br>
difficult to have the sort of control over the boarding students when<br>
there are many day students around who are much freer.  I believe this<br>
was a problem as far back as Battle Creek College, and was a major<br>
contributor to the move to the more rural location in Berrien Springs!<br>
There are academies which have managed this.  Thunderbird comes to mind.<br>
It's located in suburban Phoenix, AZ, and has (or at least used to have)<br>
both boarding and day students.  Auburn may be another.  I'm not sure;<br>
I've never been there.  There may be other examples.<br>
<p>
When I was teaching elementary/junior academy grades, I noticed a real<br>
trend for parents wanting to keep their children at home through the 9th<br>
or 10th grade before sending them away to school (epecially a boarding<br>
academy).  This has also had its impact on the academies they eventually<br>
attend.<br>
<p>
Just a few thoughts on a Friday afternoon.<br>
