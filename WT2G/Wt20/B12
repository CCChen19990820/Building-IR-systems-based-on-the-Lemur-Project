I just saw the NBC made-for-TV movie about the events that led up to the raid<br>
on the Mt. Carmel complex.  The Seventh-day Adventist church was never <br>
mentioned by name, and oblique references were few.  The details seem <br>
to match most of the other things we have heard.  Lots of shooting, lots<br>
of preaching before the shooting. <br>
<p>
Has anyone figured out who this John Ellis character is yet?  Those<br>
advertisements of the "Worldwide Council of SDA" are nothing but trouble.<br>

I am one American who is horrified by the national obsession with guns.<br>
While I understand the historical background of this (the revolution and<br>
resulting constitutional guarantee of the right to "bear arms") and the<br>
need to tame the frontier, I support any efforts to curb the uncontrolled<br>
availabity of firearms.  Somehow it's become associated with virility<br>
and masculinity (and certainly supported by the public media).  And then<br>
of course there are the unconscionable efforts of the National Rifle<br>
Association, which doesn't see any difference between prohibiting<br>
weapons designed for warfare and those meant for hunting.  We must admit<br>
that most guns were designed to kill people, not animals.  To them, any<br>
attempt to differentiate seems a threat to any use of guns at all.  I<br>
suppose it's similar to the idea that any attempt to register cars and<br>
license their drivers is a threat to car ownership.  However, appeals to<br>
reason don't seem to make much difference with this group, which I'm<br>
tempted to say is mostly redneck anyway.  Even the police are pleading<br>
for a change in policy.<br>
<p>
Of course the more guns there are, the more there becomes a legitimate<br>
reason for additional guns for self-protection.  Just what it will take<br>
to change these attitudes is hard to say.  The level of carnage already<br>
is appalling.  How much worse does it have to get?  I suppose some Adventists<br>
would say it's reason to move to the country (not to say there aren't<br>
any guns out here!).<br>

Tom is right, lawyer wasn't on the original list of "Approved<br>
Occupations" (neither was politician!).  It probably became acceptable<br>
in the '60s and '70s.  Dentist was added in the '40s or so when LLU<br>
added this program.  Most of our colleges started with a small student<br>
body (a few hundred), and of course a small number of offerings.  In the<br>
19th century, most colleges and the new universities didn't have large<br>
offerings.  Many of our overseas colleges are still this<br>
way--concentrating on ministerial training with a few others thrown in.<br>
I suspect that is the way things began in the U.S. as well.  <br>
<p>
Bull and Lockhart (I hesistate to call "Seeking a Sanctuary" a<br>
must-read, but it's very good) point out that SDA occupational choice is<br>
often related to those occupations and professions with little or no<br>
Sabbath problems.  For example, you can be a doctor and work (at least<br>
to some degree) on Sabbath in good conscience, but you can't be a<br>
librarian and do the same (not many SDA librarians working outside the<br>
church).  <br>
<p>
However, again in the '60s and on, because of increasing demand of SDA<br>
students for more occupational options, the North American SDA colleges<br>
and universities have vastly expanded their offerings--architect,<br>
engineer, social worker, physical therapist, and on and on.  However,<br>
this expansion (necessary though it may be) has put the entire "system"<br>
at financial risk.  There simply aren't enough students to go around<br>
among all the schools, some of which have remained small and some of<br>
which have grown both in numbers of students and programs.  Few have<br>
adequate numbers of students to support the programs they have.  Andrews<br>
is under the gun with its accrediting association on this very issue.<br>
This is also a significant problem elsewhere.  Under the current<br>
circumstances, there seems little future for those institutions under<br>
1,000 students (the number generally accepted in higher education as the<br>
minimum to even be able to support the necessary support services).<br>
<p>
Like gun control, what the crisis it will take to resolve this issue<br>
remains to be seen because the church (for political and sentimental<br>
reasons) seems unwilling or incapable of making the kinds of dramatic<br>
changes that are probably called for.<br>
<p>
Fred correctly points out the technology program at Andrews.  He did not<br>
point out two attendant problems.  One is, as noted above, there simply<br>
aren't enough students in these programs to cover the instructional<br>
costs in many cases, and so the programs lose money, which has to be<br>
found elsewhere in the institution.  There is a barely-concealed civil<br>
war here at the present on that very issue.  The other is a lack of<br>
academic compatability between some of these and other programs.<br>
However, let me hasten to point out that I personally have great<br>
admiration and respect for those who clean our buildings, run the<br>
computing center, fix my car, and supervise construction of my house.<br>
It takes all types (doing a good job in their area) to make the world go<br>
'round, and we academics certainly shouldn't look down on those who work<br>
with their hands (or vise versa).<br>
<p>
On an unrelated topic, my ear has no difficulty at all distinguishing<br>
between acoustic music and synthesized sound, and hardly think one can<br>
compare a synthesizer with a fine pipe organ.  Perhaps someday that will<br>
be true, but certainly isn't at present any more than a fine playback<br>
system replaces the live concert.<br>

Consider an Adventist college with five hundred indoor students. If every one<br>
of these students were to own a firearm, that would amount to five hundred<br>
weapons within quite a small space. Would this be considered stockpiling<br>
weapons? I myself would certainly feel as though I were in an armoury, or<br>
at least in a military training camp. So to me, the Branch Davidians had an<br>
attitude to weapons quite different to the church at large, even to the world<br>
at large.<br>
<p>
Mind you, what they predicted did occur, ie they were invaded with force by<br>
an armed adversary. Self-fulfilling prophecy??<br>

<i>&gt; Lets broaden the scope a bit more then. According to this concept, it is </i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong for me to attack sin without having at least tried it out myself. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Not having tried it out for myself puts me in a position of merely repeating</i><br>
<i>&gt; the prejudices and biases of others. !!!!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thats like saying I shouldn't tell people not to drink, unless I've had a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; first can can personally relate from first hand experience what drinking was</i><br>
<i>&gt; like !</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; *_NOT_* so.</i><br>
<p>
Let me repeat myself.  To attack a book or other publication without at least<br>
starting to read it yourself puts you in a position where you're merely<br>
repeating the prejudices and biases of others.<br>
<p>
All I'm saying is that you should *admit* it.  Not that you can't attack it.<br>
Not that you can't condemn it.  All I'm saying is that until you read<br>
something, you can't condemn it from personal experience.<br>
<p>
Let's contrast that with alcohol consumption.  There are observable things<br>
that I can point to that keep me from drinking.  Like some of my relatives,<br>
who exhibit strong addictive behavior to alcohol and other vices.  I can<br>
condemn drinking on that basis because I've observed the pain they have<br>
endured and the destruction that drinking caused.<br>
<p>
And you can condemn a book based on the reaction that people have.  "By their<br>
fruits ye shall know them."  If reading something causes people that you know<br>
to lose their relationship with Christ, you can say so.  (As you do later on<br>
about The White Lie.)<br>
<p>
If you respect the experience and wisdom of someone, and they condemn the book<br>
for whatever reason, that's alright as well.  But remember: your understanding<br>
of why the book is condemned is necessarily filtered by the other person's<br>
biases and prejudices.  You lose the ability to put the words of the book into<br>
whatever context it might mean to you.  You are simply repeating what someone<br>
else says, without adding your own experience or understanding to the<br>
situation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I know something is wrong because God's testimony tells me or if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; goes against God's revealed truth then there is absolutely _no_ need for me</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be aquainted and familiar with it, in order to condemn it. In fact I</i><br>
<i>&gt; should avoid all association with it, because it know it to be evil.</i><br>
<p>
We should avoid all association with that which we know to be evil.  Amen.  In<br>
fact, we should avoid all association with that which is questionable, and<br>
doesn't lead us directly to a closer walk with God.<br>
<p>
How do you know if something is wrong?  What if a book claims to lead you to a<br>
better understanding of Gods' Truth?  How do you know what God's testimony is,<br>
or how does God revel truth to you about a book or publication that has been<br>
written only in the last 6 months or 6 years?  Are you putting someone besides<br>
God in a position to tell you what truth is?  If so, who is that person?  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So do you suggest we must all go out and read Kelloggs book "The Living</i><br>
<i>&gt; Temple" before we can condemn it ? That just like saying that I should</i><br>
<i>&gt; go to a seance before I can condemn spiritism. No way.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree with your connection, but I'll let that slide.  Once again: if you<br>
condemn the book, you should also provide the basis for that condmenation.<br>
Someone had to have read the book in order to form an opinion about it.  Who<br>
was that person, what was their purpose for reading it, and how much can I<br>
trust their wisdom?<br>
<p>
I don't go to seances because I trust the testimony of multiple people who<br>
have.  I compare the claims of the mediums against the Bible, and find them in<br>
disagreement.  I trust the Bible.  So I don't go.  I challenge you to perform<br>
a similar analysis with your condemnation of "The Living Temple."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Same goes for the White lie, mind you I have read the book, when I was young</i><br>
<i>&gt; and naive, It offically was handed out at church to all the church members,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I read it and I know what it says, and I know that this very book is what</i><br>
<i>&gt; EGW wrote about when she said that just before the end of time, opposition</i><br>
<i>&gt; would arise to the Testimonies, and that those who would leave God's</i><br>
<i>&gt; truth and receive the mark of the beast would first loose their confidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the Testiminies. This single book in its time probably did the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most in unsettling the faith and causing many to leave the church than</i><br>
<i>&gt; all other factors at the time.</i><br>
<p>
Thank you for a clear review of the White Lie.  I now know why you condemn it,<br>
and what basis you have to do so.  That is all that I'm asking for.<br>

I have sat back and read most of the spew about organs that have<br>
appeared here in the last few months.  Maybe it is living away from the<br>
'cultured' areas of the world, but for the life of me I can not<br>
understand why an expensive organ is needed.<br>
<p>
It would seem to me that the money could be used for so many more<br>
important worth while means.  One that comes to mind is the lack of<br>
shortwave radios stations, like the one on Guam, which is used to send<br>
the message to Asia.<br>
<p>
Other means for the money could be used also.  I am sure many of you<br>
could think of ways to spend it other than on a new organ.<br>
<p>
Like I said before, I guess I just dont understand...<br>

Last night 60 minutes re-ran their story on sexual harassment in the ATF.  I<br>
had seen the story before, but I watched it again anyway.  At the end the said<br>
that the agents involved in the sexual harassment case thought that the raid in<br>
Waco was staged to get positive publicity for the ATF.  I had heard some<br>
negative thoughts on the motivation for the raid, but this was the first one<br>
that sounded credible to me, since it comes from prior and current ATF agents. <br>
I had thought that the raid was justified, but now I am beginning to think<br>
maybe it wasn't.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;What I am concerned about is the evangelical zeal which some use to</i><br>
<i>&gt;promote homosexuality as a way of life. When homosexuality becomes an</i><br>
<i>&gt;excuse for selfish gratification, then it becomes wrong. In that sense</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is just as wrong as someone who uses marriage as an excuse for</i><br>
<i>&gt;selfish gratification.</i><br>
<p>
If there are other behavioral science/human relations people on the net, they<br>
might confirm or refute my belief:<br>
<p>
For millennia, homosexuals have been "oppressed".  It is not difficult for<br>
someone with a teachable mind to imagine the options open to people who<br>
find themselves in more hostile times than the present.  At first, they were<br>
unquestionably "sinners", burned, drowned or done away with in other<br>
creative ways.  Then enlightened thought described them as "sick",<br>
"unfortunates who just couldn't help themselves", but who turn into <br>
sinners once<br>
they think themselves to be "well" - especially as "well" as anyone else.<br>
These two views have continued till now.  However, within the last few years a<br>
new view has emerged, mainly among homosexuals themselves, and even<br>
more recently, their family and friends (people who've had a personal<br>
relationship with them).  This third view is that they are _humans_ first, thus<br>
deserving of human rights.  Moreover, judgment of any "mental sickness" in<br>
homosexuals should be done taking into account the options society gives<br>
them - what are their "alternatives"?<br>
<p>
Society has regulated their place, in work, housing, and familial status.<br>
The church has regulated their place in membership and mission.  Finding no<br>
"city of refuge" among 'believers', it is likely that they lose hope and even<br>
become bitter.  In thinking that the Church speaks for God, and that <br>
even God has<br>
no place for them in His kingdom - given various interpretations of scripture,<br>
many will chose to take their own lives swiftly, or slowly through <br>
harmful lifestyles.<br>
Let the believers turn around and point the finger (act of worship to <br>
self's own<br>
righteousness) at those lifestyles (symptoms of lost hope, and self <br>
worship) and<br>
the scene is RIPE for confusion and rejection between both parties.  This is<br>
extremely important in discussing what some call "the gay community" or "the<br>
gay lifestyle".<br>
<p>
NOW put yourself in the place of a parent of a homosexual person.  You have<br>
"believer" friends, who are outspoken about the 'evil' homosexuality is.<br>
They recite proof-text as support for the way they treat your child, <br>
and propose<br>
that their view is the only view which is from God.  You see some of them form<br>
citizen alliances and raise huge sums of money to combat the "homosexual<br>
problem" while others watch in silence.  You speak to the vocal, but they don't<br>
hear you for the noise which the proof-text and phobia make in their heads.<br>
The silent don't hear you either, for the fear of being different, or <br>
losing their<br>
souls (by knowing and speaking out for 'sinners').  Meanwhile, your whole<br>
town has ruled that your child, solely because of who s/he is, will not be<br>
protected by the police when people throw rocks at their home or try to<br>
beat their brains out.  There will be no job security for this child, <br>
and forget<br>
about all the lessons you taught her/him about telling the truth, cause we<br>
prefer you to lie, than make us uncomfortable in our prejudice.<br>
<p>
A counselor friend of mine who among other things, counsels gay and lesbian<br>
youth, told me of a member of his discussion group.  The youth's parents<br>
recently disowned him, kicking him out of his home for being (I assume)<br>
an "avowed" (someone who doesn't have self pity or shame) gay.  The youth<br>
and his parents are Seventh-day Adventist.  I don't know if the youth is still<br>
"Seventh-day Adventist".  I can see that is would be difficult to remain so.<br>
This kind of stuff is happening everyday, thousands of times in hundreds of<br>
"believing" circles.<br>
<p>
The point is, our words and actions do not exist in a vacuum.  As Christ said<br>
that His words go out and do not return void, so do our own.  What type of<br>
return are we casting out on the sea of life?  I believe that Christ is calling<br>
believers to stop and think, what are we really doing with the homosexual,<br>
and even their loved ones?  When the proof text have all been said, we still<br>
must address the practical = real people, real lives, and a real God.<br>
<p>
Some say we are of Moses, or Paul, but few say we are of Christ.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; I must agree with Harvey Brenneise: to attack a book or other publication</i><br>
<i>&gt; without at least starting to read it yourself puts you in a postition where</i><br>
<i>&gt; you're merely repeating the prejudices and biases of others.  (Forgive me if I</i><br>
<i>&gt; misunderstand your position....)  On the other hand, we need not recommend</i><br>
<i>&gt; that "all SDAs" "get and read Kellogg's book" because not "all SDAs" have an</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest in that time and place in church history.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Lets broaden the scope a bit more then. According to this concept, it is <br>
wrong for me to attack sin without having at least tried it out myself. <br>
Not having tried it out for myself puts me in a position of merely repeating<br>
the prejudices and biases of others. !!!!!<br>
<p>
Thats like saying I shouldn't tell people not to drink, unless I've had a few<br>
first can can personally relate from first hand experience what drinking was<br>
like !<br>
<p>
*_NOT_* so.<br>
<p>
If I know something is wrong because God's testimony tells me or if it<br>
goes against God's revealed truth then there is absolutely _no_ need for me to<br>
be aquainted and familiar with it, in order to condemn it. In fact I should<br>
avoid all association with it, because it know it to be evil.<br>
<p>
<p>
That's exactly what Satan told Eve, he said "don't believe God's word, He's <br>
biased look I've tried the fruit for myself and its ok. Try it for yourself<br>
and you'll see what I mean". And Eve did just follow this counsel and<br>
wow ! Satan was right, she didn't die. See God was wrong all along !!!!!<br>
So she took that same story to Adam, and you know what Satan still brings<br>
us this same story and we keep on falling again and again into the same<br>
trap, and he knows and can't believe that we can be so stupid as to keep<br>
falling for the same line.<br>
<p>
No Way, Eve should not even been near the tree, and that goes for all<br>
of us, why should we need to drink of polluted fountains to know that <br>
the water tastes bad ? Why should we go listen to the arguments of<br>
the serpent when we have been warned of the dangers of wandering too<br>
close to the tree of knowledge of good and evil !!<br>
<p>
The understanding of God's truth is sufficient, I don't need to wallow in<br>
the mud to know its dirt. I don't need to go out and read every worldly and<br>
satanic publication to better appreciate their arguments to know they're bad. <br>
<p>
So do you suggest we must all go out and read Kelloggs book "The Living<br>
Temple" before we can condemn it ? That just like saying that I should<br>
go to a seance before I can condemn spiritism. No way.<br>
<p>
Same goes for the White lie, mind you I have read the book, when I was young<br>
and naive, It offically was handed out at church to all the church members,<br>
I read it and I know what it says, and I know that this very book is what<br>
EGW wrote about when she said that just before the end of time, opposition<br>
would arise to the Testimonies, and that those who would leave God's<br>
truth and receive the mark of the beast would first loose their confidence<br>
in the Testiminies. This single book in its time probably did the<br>
most in unsettling the faith and causing many to leave the church than<br>
all other factors at the time.<br>

I think that we will give the interpretation to Bible texts that reinforce our previously formed opinions.  We will search to find texts that make us <br>
look good in the positions we have chosen to assume in life.  We will attempt<br>
to use the Holy One to strengthen our humanly defined position even if it<br>
means that we are subjugating another human being.<br>

As for which came first, my "previously formed opinions" on the use of guns by<br>
SDAs or my upbringing and Bible teachings regarding the sanctity of life, I<br>
would have to definetly say the later.  And contrary to what you may belive, my<br>

<p>
Yes it is a tragedy, but the problem (IMHO) is due to lack of respect for and<br>
education of proper handling and storage of guns AND a law enforcement system<br>
that in ineffective at removing the right to bear arms to those who have<br>
_violated_ their right by using guns in an unlawful manner (theft, murder, etc).<br>
<p>
I would not call it an obsession, but a strong feeling regarding our right to<br>
own guns.  The US is one of the few countries in the world that still allows<br>
this right.  Many people lost their lives gaining and then protecting that<br>
right.  We don't take this right lightly, but value it.  Unfortunately, as with<br>
all freedoms, people eventually lose their respect of their God given freedoms<br>
and abuse them.  This does not mean the freedoms should be taken away from<br>
all...just those who abuse these freedoms.<br>
<p>
Many anti-gunners think the solution is to create more laws to remove these<br>
freedoms to own guns.  But the problem with that is, another law won't stop a<br>
law-breaker.  Therefore, a new law simply restricts and hence punishes those of<br>
us who choose to abide by the laws already in place.<br>
<p>
Incidently, if numbers of needless deaths is what concerns you, then please take<br>
a closer look at the number of people that die in the USA &amp; other countries as a<br>
result of alchohol (drunk driving, siroesis of the liver, etc).  It far<br>
outnumbers the quantity of those killed by guns.  Yet, do we hear of laws to<br>
outlaw alchohol?<br>

<i>&gt;My</i><br>
<i>&gt;source is an organ professor here at Morehead State, who joined our</i><br>
<i>&gt;church last year and moved in his Yamaha Electone and now provides us</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the most beautiful music on Sabbaths!</i><br>
<p>
Is this a synthesizer with three(?) keyboards (manuals in organ parlance)<br>
and a full set of pedals?  If so, I can attest that the versatility of this<br>
machine is certainly well beyond that of your typical Conn or Allen<br>
electronic organ.  It is also not your typical synthesizer.  We had such a<br>
machine here at Andrews for a concert about three years ago.  It was rented<br>
(I believe Yamaha reduced / underwrote the price due to our educational<br>
status) for the performance of a 20th century piece for electronic<br>
keyboards and orchestra, Adams "Fearful Symmetries" if I recall correctly. <br>
I was a technical consultant (I knew how to hook up wires) to the orchestra<br>
conductor and had occasion to connect and disconnect this "organ" on a<br>
number of occasions during the month or so that it was here.  It seemed to<br>
have most of the functionality of an organ but with the added advantage of<br>
being a MIDI capable synthesizer.  I don't recall all of it's features and<br>
never really knew its price, but I would encourage anyone looking at the<br>
purchase of an electronic organ to at least explore this avenue.<br>

<i>&gt; Hello SDAnetters:</i><br>
<p>
Hi!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What is it with the American obsession with guns?  </i><br>
<p>
It's much more of an issue in the press than it is in reality...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Did any of you see the Nightline program last week, where Ted</i><br>
<i>&gt; interviewed some folk on this subject?</i><br>
<p>
Mr. Koppel is more evenhanded on the subject than most in the U.S.<br>
media, but still not exactly impartial.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I am not mistaken, the statistics indicate that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the USA, tens of thousands of people die every year as a result of</i><br>
<i>&gt; hand gun violence, whereas in Canada, Japan and Britain, less than</i><br>
<i>&gt; 70, (yes 7-0-) die a year.  </i><br>
<p>
This has been true since long before gun control was instituted in<br>
the UK or Canada...they choose other methods of killing (and committing<br>
suicide, which accounts for more than half those numbers).  Canada and<br>
the UK historically had lower violence rates than did the U.S., and they<br>
still do, although *not* by the wide margin that they once did, and *that*<br>
is something to be concerned with: their violence-crime rates are rising<br>
faster than U.S. rates.<br>
<p>
If you subtract gun-related homicide in the U.S. in lower-class economic<br>
urban neighborhoods, and the portion of drug-trade-related violence in<br>
the rest of the country, you would see something interesting: the overall<br>
homicide rate that remains is equal to, or slightly lower than, Canada's<br>
rate. (Just in case you might have thought that socioeconomic conditions<br>
of someone somewhere else had no bearing on your own life...we should<br>
justifiably be concerned with more than others physical and spiritual<br>
health alone.)<br>
<p>
The problem is one of violence (sin), and that problem should not be lost<br>
sight of in fixating on the tools used toward that end.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yet most Americans can see nothing unusual or catastrophic about those</i><br>
figures.<br>
<p>
I think most Americans do see the problem...they just disagree on the way to<br>
fix the problem.  Some solutions will definitely make things worse, some<br>
will help; the problem being how to choose which one(s) to use.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is human life worth so little to us that we argue about our right to</i><br>
bear arms?  <br>
<p>
When government (FBI and other) studies indicate that there are somewhere<br>
between 400K and 1million with-gun defenses from criminal assault each year,<br>
more than 99% of which involve no firearm discharge, there may be some<br>
reason to continue the discussion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; many more die at the hands of relatives or friends or</i><br>
<i>&gt; by accident than by the drive-by shootings and violent crime we often</i><br>
<i>&gt; use as an excuse for our need to protect ourselves.</i><br>
<p>
The correct usage is "by acquaintences", which has been incorrectly changed<br>
to "relatives and friends". The term "loved one" is often used to describe<br>
incidents which did not by any stretch of the imagination fall into that<br>
relationship.  But it sounds better in the news.<br>
<p>
Criminal assault by pure stangers is fairly rare, comparatively speaking, and<br>
*most* criminal assault is done by someone against someone they know, whether<br>
that person is a competing drug dealer, or the local shopkeeper who just<br>
happens to be more convenient to visit than the local bank.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe there is something else that I don't  understand being an</i><br>
<i>&gt; immigrant of only 12 years.</i><br>
<p>
Most of us don't completely understand the issue, either, so don't<br>
feel bad.<br>
<p>
The problem is sin. Period.  The issue is how best to deal with it.<br>
<p>
[SDAnet is never going to solve the problem of gun control in society <br>
at large, nor should we waste bandwidth reciting the same arguments that<br>
are repeated elsewhere.  If there are specific SDA-related issues here,<br>
such as why did Koresh go off the deep end, or how should one be a <br>
pastor in Big Shotgun Gap, VA where there have been several shootings<br>
within the congregation, fine, let's discuss.  Otherwise, I think <br>
this discussion is repeating itself.  SCT]<br>

It seems that in the current "I'm recovering, you're co-dependent" world<br>
of the SDA church, we are losing an important distinction.  Most of those<br>
who have argued against the standard church position on homosexuality have<br>
used the argument "We shouldn't condemn people."  I agree that Christ did <br>
not come to condemn and neither should we.  But whether we condemn someone<br>
or not has nothing to do with whether what they are doing is a sin.  <br>
Nowadays we are so loath to judge that we convince ourselves that there<br>
really are no rights and no wrongs.  "It all depends on the situation"<br>
"I was born that way, it's my nature."  SO WHAT?!  We have inborn tendencies<br>
to all sorts of sin, stealing, lying, cheating, you name it.  God sent not <br>
his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him<br>
might be saved.<br>
<p>
Those who say that homosexuality should be accepted because it is Biblically<br>
OK, where do you draw the line?  Is there any behavior at all that is <br>
unacceptable in the way you read the Bible?  Is the prohibition against<br>
bestiality similarly "culturally conditioned?"  (It's in the same<br>
chapter).<br>
If someone is oriented towards sadism is this acceptable?  What about<br>
pedophilia?  necrophilia?  It seems to me that for each of these an<br>
"orientation" could similarly be manufactured, "rights" declared, and <br>
the next step is of course affirmative action for this "oppressed minority."<br>
<p>
I do not advocate reacting towards homosexuals with either fear or <br>
condemnation, although you may sense that there is some fear in my post.<br>
It's just that I honestly do not see how one can interpret the Bible to <br>
allow homosexuality and still have any meaning or authority to it at all.<br>
If we believe Genesis 1 where man and woman are a singular image of God,<br>
the logical conclusion is that procreation is a way that we as humans share <br>
with God in the act of creation, and perversions of that border on blasphemy.<br>
(Of course, this too is a slippery slope, as I have mentioned before.)<br>
<p>
Those who would favor "rights" for homosexuals with the church, do you <br>
ever envision the day when homosexuals will teach in our church schools?<br>
If so, then we enter the area where civil liberties conflict with religious<br>
liberties.  Already this is happening at Carnegie Mellon, where there are<br>
strong rules against gay-bashing, to the point of restricting freedom of<br>
speech.  Where will their rights stop and mine begin?  Do "normal<br>
individuals" plaster the campus restrooms with graffiti saying<br>
where and when anonymous sexual encounters may be had?  <br>
<p>
Some say that the oppression came and forced the gays underground to the<br>
various risky behaviors that they take.  It seems to me that this may <br>
be revisionist history.  <br>
<p>
I know this post may be tough, but I should say that my head is not so far<br>
in the sand that I haven't noticed that there are real people in SDA schools<br>
dealing with their own homosexuality and that of others.   This is an issue<br>
that until now has been unspeakable, and we need to get a dialogue going.<br>

I recommend reading the article in Dialogue by SDAnet's own Dave Thomas<br>
about chaos as an organizing principle of nature.  It provides<br>
interesting insights on this topic.  I also picked up interesting insights<br>
from a colloquium speaker here at Fermilab recently, who has spent<br>
much time recently trying to model the central nervous system with <br>
nonlinear dynamics.  <br>
<p>
One of the pieces of evidence he put forth is that a normal healthy<br>
human heartbeat cycle is chaotic, in other words, the amount of time<br>
between beats varies slightly from beat to beat in an unpredictable way.<br>
When EKG's of heart patients a few hours from death are studied, the <br>
heart beat is much more regular.<br>

After watching the David Koresh TV movie last night, I was once again <br>
reminded of my sensitivity to violent movies such as that one by a string <br>
of various nightmares.  Yet the pitched gun battle which ended that movie<br>
is probably tame by today's television standards.  Probably many SDAnet<br>
readers, and many children much younger than myself, could sit through<br>
that movie and not be moved at all afterwards, or have any aftereffects.<br>
Since I grew up in a home without TV, seeing it now can have a much different<br>
effect on me than most other people.<br>
<p>
I propose an axiom:  "Temptation is in the eye of the temptee."<br>
<p>
If this is true, then there are serious consequences.  For instance,<br>
a typical liberal ax to grind is the claim that moderation in alcoholic<br>
beverages, not abstinence is the rule.  Nationwide 1 in 10 who tries alcohol<br>
will become an alcoholic.  But from SDA families and those of similar<br>
background the percentage is much higher.  So here again the danger is <br>
much higher not due to any intrinsic difference in the act, but due to <br>
differences in the actor.<br>
<p>
Again, it is the same way with sports and competition.  The activity is the <br>
same, but the danger is different for those with different experience.<br>
(Here, though, I would say that SDA's are no worse than the general public.)<br>
<p>
In the Bible, there are cases where people were ordered by God to dishonor<br>
father and mother, kill people, commit adultery, steal, lie, and make<br>
graven images.  So if we are looking for excuses to do something, they <br>
can be found.  The question "what's wrong with ...." is a rhetorical question<br>
which always expects the answer "nothing".  And perhaps it is not always<br>
wrong to use the methods of the world, only dangerous in the sense that<br>
they can easily sidetrack us from God.<br>
<p>
"Lead Us Not Into Temptation" was the motto of Hadleyburg in Mark Twain's<br>
story "The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg."  But Hadleyburg could just as<br>
well be replaced by any SDA colony.  There certainly is a great effort to <br>
shield the occupants of these colonies from temptation.  Now that I look <br>
back on this effort, I don't think I am the worse for the shielding.<br>
Perhaps I am a "weak brother" who doesn't feel free to do all the things<br>
in which my "liberated" friends indulge.  But there's nothing in the <br>
Bible that says it is wrong to be weak, in fact it is encouraged by Paul.<br>
As long as people can be trained to make their own decisions whilst being <br>
shielded from temptation, this can be a good thing.<br>

Outlawing alcohol is a bit down the road.  You &gt;do&lt; hear voices asking<br>
for the first steps (ie. responsible advertising... if it's potentially lethal<br>
STATE IT!).  The special interest groups of the alcohol and tobacco<br>
industry have been kicking and screaming all the way.<br>
[I remind our readers that alcohol was in fact outlawed for almost <br>
10 years during the 1920's.  SCT]<br>
<p>
Gun control is an attempt to band-aid and ulcer.  The real problems are<br>
things which drive people to live by the gun or kill by the gun.  A few of<br>
them are:<br>
1) Poverty is first and foremost, GREED is the flip side of that<br>
2) People who don't know how to resolve differences in a peaceful way<br>
3) People who'd rather hide behind gun ownership rights, than address<br>
numbers 1 and 2<br>
4) The lost hope on the part of "the poor"<br>
<p>
It probably isn't a coincidence that money and how we treat "the poor" is<br>
spoken of so frequently scripture.<br>

The basis of American culture, and success is the concept of the free man,<br>
with land.  Our founding fathers adopted the philosphy that the only way to<br>
be truely free, is to be able to hold (own) land, and the means to defend it.<br>
Guns have been traditionaly, the weapons of choice.  An armed, freeman is the<br>
best insurance against tyranny.  Thus gun ownership is critical to making the<br>
US what it is. <br>

Marcus, thanks for your thoughts on this. It always amazes me how the <br>
subject of homosexuality can turn people who claim to be Christians <br>
into barbarians. The accusers are thinking and DOING things far worse <br>
than any "sexual sin"...and all in the name of God.  Where does <br>
Christ's unconditional love come in to play?<br>
<p>
What is the homosexuals actual crime?......LOVING another of Gods <br>
creation. Does LOVE really equal HATE?<br>

<i>|Maurice Ashton writes:</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|&gt;What I am concerned about is the evangelical zeal which some use to</i><br>
<i>|&gt;promote homosexuality as a way of life. When homosexuality becomes an</i><br>
<i>|&gt;excuse for selfish gratification, then it becomes wrong. In that sense</i><br>
<i>|&gt;it is just as wrong as someone who uses marriage as an excuse for</i><br>
<i>|&gt;selfish gratification.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|If there are other behavioral science/human relations people on the net, they</i><br>
<i>|might confirm or refute my belief:</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|For millennia, homosexuals have been "oppressed".  It is not difficult for</i><br>
<i>|someone with a teachable mind to imagine the options open to people who</i><br>
<i>|find themselves in more hostile times than the present.  At first, they were</i><br>
<i>|unquestionably "sinners", burned, drowned or done away with in other</i><br>
<i>|creative ways.  Then enlightened thought described them as "sick",</i><br>
<i>|"unfortunates who just couldn't help themselves", but who turn into </i><br>
sinners once<br>
<i>|they think themselves to be "well" - especially as "well" as anyone else.</i><br>
<i>|These two views have continued till now.  However, within the last few years a</i><br>
<i>|new view has emerged, mainly among homosexuals themselves, and even</i><br>
<i>|more recently, their family and friends (people who've had a personal</i><br>
<i>|relationship with them).  This third view is that they are _humans_ </i><br>
first, thus<br>
<i>|deserving of human rights.  Moreover, judgment of any "mental sickness" in</i><br>
<i>|homosexuals should be done taking into account the options society gives</i><br>
<i>|them - what are their "alternatives"?</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Society has regulated their place, in work, housing, and familial status.</i><br>
<i>|The church has regulated their place in membership and mission.  Finding no</i><br>
<i>|"city of refuge" among 'believers', it is likely that they lose hope and even</i><br>
<i>|become bitter.  In thinking that the Church speaks for God, and that </i><br>
even God has<br>
<i>|no place for them in His kingdom - given various interpretations of scripture,</i><br>
<i>|many will chose to take their own lives swiftly, or slowly through </i><br>
harmful lifestyles.<br>
<i>|Let the believers turn around and point the finger (act of worship to </i><br>
self's own<br>
<i>|righteousness) at those lifestyles (symptoms of lost hope, and self </i><br>
worship) and<br>
<i>|the scene is RIPE for confusion and rejection between both parties.  This is</i><br>
<i>|extremely important in discussing what some call "the gay community" or "the</i><br>
<i>|gay lifestyle".</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|NOW put yourself in the place of a parent of a homosexual person.  You have</i><br>
<i>|"believer" friends, who are outspoken about the 'evil' homosexuality is.</i><br>
<i>|They recite proof-text as support for the way they treat your child, </i><br>
and propose<br>
<i>|that their view is the only view which is from God.  You see some of them form</i><br>
<i>|citizen alliances and raise huge sums of money to combat the "homosexual</i><br>
<i>|problem" while others watch in silence.  You speak to the vocal, but </i><br>
they don't<br>
<i>|hear you for the noise which the proof-text and phobia make in their heads.</i><br>
<i>|The silent don't hear you either, for the fear of being different, or </i><br>
losing their<br>
<i>|souls (by knowing and speaking out for 'sinners').  Meanwhile, your whole</i><br>
<i>|town has ruled that your child, solely because of who s/he is, will not be</i><br>
<i>|protected by the police when people throw rocks at their home or try to</i><br>
<i>|beat their brains out.  There will be no job security for this child, </i><br>
and forget<br>
<i>|about all the lessons you taught her/him about telling the truth, cause we</i><br>
<i>|prefer you to lie, than make us uncomfortable in our prejudice.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|A counselor friend of mine who among other things, counsels gay and lesbian</i><br>
<i>|youth, told me of a member of his discussion group.  The youth's parents</i><br>
<i>|recently disowned him, kicking him out of his home for being (I assume)</i><br>
<i>|an "avowed" (someone who doesn't have self pity or shame) gay.  The youth</i><br>
<i>|and his parents are Seventh-day Adventist.  I don't know if the youth is still</i><br>
<i>|"Seventh-day Adventist".  I can see that is would be difficult to remain so.</i><br>
<i>|This kind of stuff is happening everyday, thousands of times in hundreds of</i><br>
<i>|"believing" circles.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|The point is, our words and actions do not exist in a vacuum.  As Christ said</i><br>
<i>|that His words go out and do not return void, so do our own.  What type of</i><br>
<i>|return are we casting out on the sea of life?  I believe that Christ </i><br>
is calling<br>
<i>|believers to stop and think, what are we really doing with the homosexual,</i><br>
<i>|and even their loved ones?  When the proof text have all been said, we still</i><br>
<i>|must address the practical = real people, real lives, and a real God.</i><br>
<i>|</i><br>
<i>|Some say we are of Moses, or Paul, but few say we are of Christ.</i><br>

So tell us about the Insight article especially pertinent to the discussion<br>
of relying on guns or angelic hosts? Some of us don't have ready access to<br>
such publications!<br>

I'm having difficulty understanding why we are saying homosexuality is OK<br>
or is not OK.  I believe that if I am a homosexual or not is a personal<br>

The behaviors you have listed as analogous to homosexuality all contain an<br>

not about having power over anyone else.<br>

Does this mean that since we all perhaps interpret the Bible differently<br>

this opinion to Sandoval.  We both realized that we were walking hand in<br>

heterosexual.  We feel most comfortable walking hand in hand or arm in arm.  How<br>
maddening it must be to have to deny oneself these parts of a relationship<br>
for fear one will encounter someone expressing their "religious liberty" and<br>
feeling authorized by God to punish the sinners (e.g. the lesbian who was<br>
shot in Washington, D.C. a couple of months ago because she rebuffed a<br>

SYNTHESIZER VS ORGAN<br>
<p>
First let me say that an electronic organ is a particular type of synthesizer.<br>
The differences between an instrument that would be classified as an "organ"<br>
and an "electronic keyboard" are these:<br>
<p>
1.	An organ has its own amplification system, and if it does use external<br>
	power amplifiers for extra volume, those are usually under the control<br>
	of the organist and are not used by or controlled by anything else.<br>
<p>
	An electronic keyboard, or "synthesizer", generally has either no <br>
	amplification system, or a very low-powered one for monitoring<br>
	purposes only. That is, just enough for the keyboard player to hear<br>
	him/herself. Further amplification can be either with an external<br>
	instrument amplifier, or through the house sound system if it is<br>
	capable of amplifying the full frequency range. (Many church systems<br>
	are not.)<br>
<p>
2.	In the tradition of acoustic organs, electronic organs allow the<br>
	organist to layer sounds, adding different timbres together to create<br>
	the desired effect. This is a simple process, and organs are usually<br>
	designed so that this can be done "real time".<br>
<p>
	Synthesizers generally have a range of preset sounds of which the<br>
	musician can select one or a few, depending on the complexity of<br>
	the instrument. Any tailoring of the sound needs to be done prior<br>
	to the performance, and the resulting sound stored in memory. It is<br>
	virtually impossible to do much of this in real time. This is<br>
	analogous to the organist selecting the stops to be used, done one<br>
	step at a time, usually during practice, not performance. An<br>
	accomplished organist, however, can select stops on the run, while<br>
	this is not practical with a synthesizer.<br>
<p>
3.	Different organs have a similar sound for the various stops, allowing<br>
	an organist to move from one installation to another with a minimum<br>
	of adjustment.<br>
<p>
	Synthesizers, however, vary tremendously, and a musician unfamiliar<br>
	with a particular keyboard can find it difficult to locate the<br>
	desired sounds.<br>
<p>
4.	Many electronic organs are designed for one purpose: to produce organ-<br>
	like sounds as best they can. They are optimized for this, and some<br>
	do an OK job of it, although clearly an electronic instrument can<br>
	never sound the same as a pipe organ with its myriad of tonal colors,<br>
	mechanical aspects, and the presence obtained from a large array of<br>
	sound sources.<br>
<p>
	Synthesizers are usually designed for use by contemporary musicians,<br>
	and are often used instead of string sections, tuned percussion,<br>
	horn sections or pianos. Few have a range of organ sounds, although<br>
	most have two or three to choose from - generally a Hammond sound,<br>
	a "cathedral" diapason sound (attempting the pipe organ), and a <br>
	"small church organ" sound.<br>
<p>
5.	Organs have a pedal board and two or more manuals. A synthesizer<br>
	has only one keyboard and no pedals.<br>
<p>
I have simplified things here, of course; there are many hybrid-type <br>
instruments around these days, and the modern "home organ" is kind of <br>
fifty-fifty. The Electone Lola referred to may fit this hybrid category,<br>
unless it is more than about eight years old, in which case it is more<br>
of an electronic organ.<br>
<p>
As far as sound goes, there is no electronic instrument which can duplicate<br>
its acoustic counterpart. Synthesizer manufacturers continue to spend large<br>
amounts of research money to achieve this aim, and they're getting closer.<br>
But even if an electronic piano were to sound exactly like an acoustic<br>
piano (impossible!), the experience of playing it would still be lacking,<br>
and it would still rely on amplification to produce any sound at all.<br>
<p>
Having said that, a good-quality synthesizer with acceptable key action<br>
and a decent set of factory sampled sounds is quite an asset in many<br>
situations. It can substitute for a wide range of instruments, and do<br>
that quite well. It is portable, and subject to the availability of<br>
suitable amplification can be used anywhere. It doesn't go out of tune.<br>
It can be used for many forms of music, from straight piano through<br>
brass band to contemporary. It is affordable.<br>
<p>
Now for my conclusions.<br>
<p>
A synthesizer is not well suited for use in a church. It can not easily<br>
fill the role of an organ, and a person needs to be a little more<br>
"technically oriented" to use it to its full potential. The exception<br>
would be if your church uses piano far more than organ, in which case<br>
the appropriate synthesizer may well do the job if portability and<br>
price are a consideration.<br>
<p>
WHOOPS - please, PLEASE let me rephrase the above! A synthesizer is not<br>
well suited to replace the organ in a church. !!!!!  Steve, if you are<br>
still reading here maybe you could fix that properly for me????<br>
<p>
At the same time, many traditional SDAs have a "thing" against synthesizers.<br>
This is similar to the situation a couple of decades ago, when guitars were<br>
frowned upon because they were used in rock music. As far as the actual<br>
hardware is concerned, there is no difference between an electronic organ<br>
and a synthesizer. Both create or reproduce sounds electronically. There is<br>
nothing "wrong" with a synthesizer, unless it sounds terrible!<br>
<p>
Synthesizers can be used to good effect in Sabbath Schools, with or instead<br>
of the piano, at camp meetings, in many kinds of bands, and I have even<br>
heard one played with an organ. (Organ/harpsichord duet! Sounded good, too.)<br>
<p>
One final note of caution: a synthesizer is totally dependent on its <br>
amplification. It is unrealistic to expect to plug a synthesizer into a<br>
speech-only sound system and have it sound reasonable. If your church<br>
has a speech-only sound system and you plan to use a synthesizer, you<br>
will need to either upgrade your amplifiers and speakers (!) or purchase<br>
a capable amplifier along with the keyboard. This is a *necessary part*<br>
of the synthesizer purchase, and should be included in any cost estimates.<br>
<p>
Any questions - drop me an e-line! <br>

[I remind our readers that alcohol was in fact outlawed for almost<br>
10 years during the 1920's.  SCT]<br>
<p>
Technically speaking.  The inhibitions only drove people underground,<br>
literally.  Some of the towns here in the west have almost a "city under<br>
the city", where alcohol, prostitution and "legitimate" business thrived.<br>

Steve:<br>
<p>
Sorry about this, but I couldn't let Harvey's post go by<br>
unanswered.<br>
<p>
For anyone starting this, unless you're really interested<br>
in this topic, you might want to skip over it; it's long.<br>
<p>
That said, I'd like to make it clear that I'm, at this point,<br>
a member either of the NRA or of any gun-control orgainization.<br>
I am, however, concerned with the issues that Harvey raises, and<br>
have been studying them for some time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From: brneise@edmund.cs.andrews.edu (Harvey Brenneise)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am one American who is horrified by the national obsession with guns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; While I understand the historical background of this (the revolution and</i><br>
<i>&gt; resulting constitutional guarantee of the right to "bear arms") and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; need to tame the frontier, I support any efforts to curb the uncontrolled</i><br>
<i>&gt; availabity of firearms.  </i><br>
<p>
I was with you up to this point.<br>
<p>
 1. With more than 20,000 gun-control laws on the books in the U.S., <br>
    one might have some trouble claiming that firearms availability<br>
    is "uncontrolled". (That the control being exercised is imperfect<br>
    is another thing entirely.)<br>
<p>
 2. Nowhere in the U.S. are minors, convicted felons or those judged<br>
    mentally incompetant allowed to purchase firearms. Interstate <br>
    mail-order sales of firearms are prohibited. One may not (legally)<br>
    travel to an adjoining state to purchase firearms. Various states,<br>
    counties and cities often have restrictions in addition to the above<br>
    federal laws. (And criminals ignore all of the above...unless you can<br>
    either form a law that affects the criminals, or change their hearts,<br>
    you will be wasting your time.)<br>
<p>
 3. LBJ once said that the test of the usefulness of a law is not "who<br>
    will it help", but "who will it hurt". A law that restricts the<br>
    law-abiding, while not affecting the lawbreaker is of limited utility,<br>
    at best. If it causes an increase of suffering to the law-abiding, then<br>
    it is almost certainly a bad law.  We have *lots* of the latter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Somehow it's become associated with virility</i><br>
<i>&gt; and masculinity (and certainly supported by the public media).</i><br>
<p>
I know a number of women who would be vastly amused by this. None of them<br>
particularly masculine.<br>
<p>
The broadcast media, in particular television and movies that glorify violence,<br>
have little or nothing to do with reality...although there is strong evidence<br>
that they are a major factor in the increase in all types of violence in<br>
our culture. (The most striking evidence for this that I've seen was a study<br>
profiling the rise in all sorts of violence in South Africa that followed the<br>
introduction of television there beginning in the 1950's.)<br>
<p>
Of course, the tv and movie studios deny that they could possibly have any<br>
effect on people's behavior, and scream loudly about violating the First<br>
Amendment if they are called to task about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And then of course there are the unconscionable efforts of the National</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rifle Association, which doesn't see any difference between prohibiting</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons designed for warfare and those meant for hunting.</i><br>
<p>
This would be something to worry about if it were true.  Unfortunately,<br>
it isn't. (But one would know this if one had bothered to ask the NRA<br>
about its position on the issue, rather than relying on NRA's opponents<br>
for one's information.)  Actually, it's not necessary to rely on the NRA's<br>
word, either, there are unbiased sources of information available, such<br>
as the FBI's periodic Uniform Crime Reports, and other objective<br>
commentators on the issues. (Being suspicious of both camps, I spent time<br>
looking for more-objective information...and it's available.)<br>
<p>
Here were two opposing groups, claiming opposite viewpoints on the same<br>
subject.  It wasn't likely that both were right, so I started looking into<br>
the issue myself. I hate being lied to, and I was most definitely concerned<br>
with the level of violence in the U.S.<br>
<p>
As I studied the issue, I found that groups like HCI and the Center to<br>
Prevent Handgun Violence and others consistently got easily-verified objective<br>
facts wrong. (And had made the same mistakes for years, not correcting<br>
themselves.)  Sorry, I don't like being treated in that fashion, not even for<br>
a "good cause".  When someone says (or implies) that the ends justifies the <br>
means, I'm gathering my things to leave. Not that the NRA is perfect, but<br>
they're correct a lot more of the time, and I've actually observed them making<br>
corrections to errors they've published.<br>
<p>
Weapons designed for warfare (real "assault rifles", not what the media<br>
wrongly label as such) are not the issue, since they have been strictly<br>
controlled since 1934, and additional controls were added in 1986. No<br>
matter what some would have you believe, all the legally-owned full-auto<br>
firearms owned in the U.S. since 1934 have been involved in a grand total<br>
of *one* murder.<br>
<p>
An assault rifle, btw, must conform to a few characteristics:<br>
<p>
	1. Use of a medium-power cartridge.<br>
	2. Medium size and weight.<br>
	3. Offer select-fire (both semiauto and full-auto operation).<br>
<p>
That last requirement means that what the evening news usually calls "assault<br>
weapons", and claims that they need to be controlled or banned, aren't.<br>
<p>
What they are indistinguishable from (except cosmetically) are any number of<br>
varmint and small-game rifles.  Looks can't kill, although this is exactly<br>
what some newscasters seem to want to make you believe. Most of the rifles in<br>
question would not be permitted in many states to be used for hunting anything<br>
larger than game smaller than deer.<br>
<p>
The California Attorney General's office, who has the job of enforcing the<br>
laws of California, including its' recent "assault weapon" ban, has after<br>
study concluded that the law is not only essentially unenforceable, because<br>
of the lack of precision in the definitions used to frame the law, but that<br>
it won't even have any noticeable effect on crime, since the firearms banned<br>
have almost no presence in gun-related crime. (They make up about 3% of<br>
firearms owned in CA, and are implicated in less than 1.5% of gun-related<br>
crimes, according to a study done by the LAPD.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We must admit that most guns were designed to kill people, not animals.  </i><br>
<p>
If we admit this, we would be wrong.<br>
<p>
The vast majority of firearms sold were originally designed for hunting,<br>
not military or self-defense use.  Of the remaining minority, a large portion<br>
is designed for (and essentially useless for anything else) target shooting.<br>
<p>
Even looking at handguns, unless you believe that the proper job of a police<br>
officer is to kill people, most have been designed for law-enforcement use.<br>
<p>
The bow and arrow was designed to kill...but what are most of them used for?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To them, any attempt to differentiate seems a threat to any use of guns at all.  </i><br>
<p>
If you were dealing with an opponent who's stated goal was to completely do<br>
away with...um...all religious books, might you not be a little resistent to going<br>
along with "reasonable" restrictions on other books proposed by your opponent?<br>
(Imagine that said opponent had a history of lying about relevent issues.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suppose it's similar to the idea that any attempt to register cars and</i><br>
<i>&gt; license their drivers is a threat to car ownership.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, it might be, but only if there was a significant movement advocation the<br>
complete banning of all motor vehicles.  Which wouldn't be unreasonable, since<br>
mv deaths total more than double the number of murders in the country.<br>
<p>
(But vehicle registration and licensing are primarily ways for a state to<br>
conduct "revenue enhancement", as they phrase it here in California, not a means<br>
to control vehicle use/ownership.) You need neither be licensed nor register<br>
a motor vehicle to legally possess and use it, unless you intend to use it on<br>
public roads.<br>
<p>
The effect of licensing and registration on highway safety is not all that<br>
certain, btw, unless your state is a *lot* tougher on periodic testing and<br>
relicensing than mine. And most aren't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However, appeals to reason don't seem to make much difference with this</i><br>
<i>&gt; group, which I'm tempted to say is mostly redneck anyway.</i><br>
<p>
I'm glad to see you use "tempted" there, Harvey. If you're talking about<br>
NRA members, their membership tends to be somewhat better-educated and<br>
employed than the rest of the national population. Their opponents would<br>
have you belive otherwise.  For that matter, most farmers that I know are<br>
neither uneducated nor uncultured, though they'd likely be classed as<br>
"rednecks". The term is unworthy of use, being, to my mind, no better than<br>
similar terms like "nigger", "slope", "chink" or "bohunk".<br>
<p>
Some others, more excitable, might be tempted to brand you a bigot, but I<br>
don't think you are, having read many posts from you here on the net.<br>
<p>
I do, however, suspect that you've been given bad information on at least<br>
some aspects of this issue, probably for all the best of reasons, but still<br>
bad information.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Even the police are pleading for a change in policy.</i><br>
<p>
Depends on which "police" you're talking about.<br>
<p>
Some organizations of police chiefs (a mostly appointive office) are calling<br>
for more gun controls. Organizations, such as Dewey Stokes' FOP, are primarily<br>
political in nature, with all that entails.<br>
<p>
At the same time, polls among rank-and-file officers (those folks who actually<br>
work out on the street) overwhelmingly indicate that they have little enthusiasm<br>
for more gun-control laws.  They, being out where things happen, understand how<br>
little good gun-control laws are likely to produce. (Polls I've seen were<br>
conducted for, and published in, publications catering to the business, such as<br>
"Law Enforcement" magazine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course the more guns there are, the more there becomes a legitimate</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason for additional guns for self-protection.  </i><br>
<p>
This explains why those places with the lowest levels of legal gun ownership<br>
are such excellent communities to live in.  Let's see: Washington D.C., Detroit,<br>
Chicago, New York City...<br>
<p>
Something's wrong here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just what it will take to change these attitudes is hard to say.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; The level of carnage already is appalling.  How much worse does</i><br>
<i>&gt; it have to get?  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I suppose some Adventists would say it's reason to move to the country</i><br>
<i>&gt; (not to say there aren't any guns out here!).</i><br>
<p>
Hate to make things worse, but legal gun ownership is *much* higher in<br>
rural areas than in the major cities where the vast majority of with-gun<br>
crimes are committed.<br>
<p>
Maybe there's something important, other than the tool, that's the <br>
relevant factor. Maybe the problem is *sin*, manifested in this case <br>
as violent behavior.<br>
<p>
Like I said, I don't belong to the NRA. But I see things in the gun-misuse<br>
and gun-control issues that should concern us all (and completely ignoring<br>
the guns themselves).<br>
<p>
Do I think that everyone should have guns? No.<br>
<p>
Do I think that *most* people need guns? No. <br>
<p>
Do I think that people should be able to make their own *informed* choice <br>
regarding them? Absolutely.<br>
<p>
It would be lovely if everyone would voluntarily give up committing <br>
violent acts of all kinds.<br>
<p>
Do I expect that it will happen? No. Sigh.<br>
<p>
Gun control laws in the U.S. have historical roots in post-Civil War efforts<br>
to "control" the poor and black populations. I think that gun-control may <br>
well be a tripwire indicator pointing to the loss of other freedoms, including<br>
religious freedom, freedom to choose how one's children should be educated,<br>
and more. Sometimes I worry that I'm paranoid, other times I'm worried that<br>
I'm not paranoid enough.<br>
<p>
When all is said and done, while I can't "put my trust in prices", I at least<br>
can put my trust in Someone else.  There's really nowhere else to go.<br>

<i>&gt; From: Raylene Dyson &lt;CHRMD@cc.newcastle.edu.au&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So tell us about the Insight article especially pertinent to the discussion</i><br>
<i>&gt; of relying on guns or angelic hosts? Some of us don't have ready access to</i><br>
<i>&gt; such publications!</i><br>
<p>
I like "Insight"...to bad it doesn't include "Radarscope" from the old<br>
Youth's Instructor days. Oh, well.<br>
<p>
The May 22, 1993 issue of Insight has an article by Jeff Riedesel<br>
recounting a frightening experience that he and his wife had.<br>
<p>
They were parked near the beach in southern California one Friday night,<br>
when seven drunk men arrived in two cars.<br>
<p>
It appears that besides being drunk, they were angry, and thought that<br>
Jeff had done something to one of their relatives, and were intending<br>
to get even. Physically.<br>
<p>
Jeff and his wife tried to ignore what was going on, until one of the <br>
group outside tried to break into the motor home (caravan?).<br>
<p>
At this point, Jeff took out a small revolver that the had and, opening<br>
the door, confronted the man.<br>
<p>
Oops. Threaten a group of drunks, and you can bet they'll threaten<br>
back.  (They produced what appeared to be "a short shotgun and a long<br>
pistol".)<br>
<p>
His wife had a better notion of what ought to be done...she prayed.<br>
<p>
And at that time the ones outside calmed down, and shortly got back<br>
in their cars and drove off.<br>
<p>
Jeff had got his priorities scrambled, not to mention coming close<br>
to violating California law (the drunks had not done more than make<br>
verbal threats and had not entered the motor home), and getting one <br>
or more people killed. <br>
<p>
He was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to relearn the need<br>
to rely on God's protection and grace.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think a key factor in eliminating this newsgroup though, comes from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the following section of the FAQ:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Judgements of sexual behavior should not be made.  ASAR readers run the gamut</i><br>
<i>&gt; from heterosexual to homosexual and everything in between.  No matter what your</i><br>
<i>&gt; orientation is, you have as much right as anyone to participate in ASAR, and as</i><br>
<i>&gt; little right to criticize someone else's sexuality as you would give to them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ***********************</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think the preceding statement does justify the canceling of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; newsgroup, in that WWC is trying to get rid of newsgroups which</i><br>
<i>&gt; contradict the beliefs of SDA's.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I'm glad that the library I work for does not cancel subscriptions for<br>
the reason given above.  As I've thought about this, I don't think<br>
subscribing to newsgroups on a network is that different from<br>
periodicals in the library.  The job of selection is a positive one in<br>
which one chooses that which contributes to the institutional mission.<br>
Pronography and items of prurient interest do not, so are not selected.<br>
This is different than censorship.  Our library subscribes to journals<br>
which contradict SDA beliefs.  We could hardly be a university and not<br>
do so.<br>

<i>&gt; I really don't see that much connection between the two cases.  In any</i><br>
<i>&gt; case, there's only one Book that I would recommend that ALL SDAs should</i><br>
<i>&gt; read.  The controversy over "The Living Temple" was more a political</i><br>
<i>&gt; power struggle in the church (viz. between the preachers/church leaders</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the medical work, specifically Kellogg) than it was over theology.</i><br>
<p>
Huh ? The living temple was an exposition of pure New Age Theology,<br>
Pantheism. The issue was whether such spiritistic matter should<br>
be published at all, let alone by the remnant church. The issue turned<br>
into a power struggle only when Kellogg and his cohorts realised that it<br>
was EGW against them, and EGW was impeding them attaining their objectives . <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have not read the book, but historians report that the charges of</i><br>
<i>&gt; pantheism were overplayed.  It is hardly controversial today, and would</i><br>
<p>
EGW didn't seem to think that the panthesism issue was of little <br>
consequence. I would question the accuracy of these later reports<br>
since they weren't there at the time. EGW made it very clear the<br>
main issue was theological, an apostacy is always somehow based on <br>
theological issues. An apostacy of the 1st magnitude it was. Read<br>
EGWs comments regarding the occasion if you like.<br>

Tang Ben seeks more clarification:<br>
<p>
When I ask "How, exactly are we to love the sinner but hate the sin?",<br>
I'm asking for suggestions for practical application.  What exact activities<br>
will be evident in the people of God, which will show that they "love" the<br>
sinner but "hate" the sin?  Love is not an ignorant response, one must be<br>
informed in order for true love to take root.  It must be informed, not <br>
only in<br>
scripture, but in the human experience and needs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, my own opinion is that if they are out of a job, we should help them</i><br>
<i>&gt;find one, not because they are homosexual, but because they are people</i><br>
<i>&gt;in need of work.</i><br>
<p>
I couldn't have asked for a better response.  : )  Tang, many people aren't<br>
getting the job _from the start_.  Not because they are people who don't<br>
need it, or they can't do the job, but **because** they are homosexual.<br>
Now, how will those who "believe" assist them?  Is "Godly love" too<br>
concerned with more important things than to address this human need?<br>
If you think a job and house are luxury, think about the peace of knowing<br>
that no one will seek you out to harm you, just because of who you are?<br>
It's kind of basic isn't it?<br>
<p>
I don't deny that the spirit of Satan's way and character can be found in both<br>
gay activism and the religious right anti-gay movement.  Yet I propose that<br>
the spirit of the enemy is more than militancy.  The opposite of love is not<br>
hate, but   &gt;_indifference_&lt; or as some might say, being 'luke-warm'.<br>
The church wants to keep clean, comfortable, and content.  So the position<br>
of some "believers" seems to be worse than lukewarm, they will speak<br>
scripture to support their belief in homosexuality = bad, but will not <br>
lift a finger<br>
to lighten the burdens of those weighted down.<br>
<p>
Again, regarding Jude 1:7, what type of sexual liaisons are these impurities?<br>
What is the perception of the people, what do they associate these liaisons<br>
with? What is the actual liaison as to what we know today?  Do we know less<br>
than they about these things?  Has knowledge increased _everywhere_ else<br>
SAVE in this instance?<br>
<p>
I don't want this to sound like you or any other "netters" must condone<br>
homosexuals their "orientation" or their relations, force is not the <br>
way of Christ,<br>
only love - informed love.<br>

There are two different issues involved with the discusion of the <br>
Waco incident and gun usage and ownership.  First Koresh was most<br>
likely doing many things that he should not have been doing.  The<br>
BATF went in on gun issues because that is all they could go in under<br>
but I am sure that they justified it with knowledge of other activities<br>
in the compound that were outside of their jurisdiction (in their minds).<br>
They could have handled it in any of a number of better ways that would<br>
have not endded in the large loss of life and the significant bad <br>
press that they recieved through it along with the fact that there<br>
are several weighty constitutional issues that are laid wide open.<br>
<p>
The second issue is gun ownership itself.  Some SDA's and some <br>
christians of other denominations as well feel that it is wrong<br>
for one person to shoot another for ANY reason including self defense<br>
or defense of ones country.  That is fine and thier desicison.  Some <br>
in our church do not hold that belief, and until it is made part of the<br>
doctrine of the church that we are pure pascifists we need to respect the<br>
rights of others to non-pure pascifistic beliefs.  I for one would take<br>
up a gun to defend myself my family my property or my country but that<br>
is my choice (and I feel that I can defend it from the bible but the<br>
people of the other opinion say the same so be it) <br>
<p>
As far as the issue of the 2nd amendment and the attempt to limit <br>
ownership of weapons to hunting perposes there is a significant <br>
misunderstanding of what the 2nd amendment was for.  The country was<br>
originally designed for very limited federal powers.  The 2nd amendment<br>
was added to allow us to protect ourselves from our own government.<br>
This can be substantially verified when you read the writtings of our<br>
founding fathers on the issue.  Thus the 2nd amendment is dealing with <br>
weapons that are used for defense not hunting.  This primarily came out of<br>
the laws of Britan at the time that denied the right to bear arms by the <br>
colinests to try to prevent a revolution.  I feel that the laws that <br>
limit gun ownership are a drastic violation of the 2nd amendment. There<br>
should only be limitations put on to convicted felons which have been in<br>
place forever to my knowledge (or at least close to forever).  <br>
<p>
I do understand that this is a very deep and difficult issue and hope that<br>
people think it out FOR THEMSELVES as I did.  It took me a long time <br>
and a lot of soul searching before I came to my conclusions.<br>

Steve, you bring up valid concerns which many people have, including<br>
those closest to homosexual people and homosexuals themselves.<br>
A rule worth remembering:  Never be a reflector of other people's thoughts<br>
and biases.  If you have thoughts and biases, take responsibility for them,<br>
be ready to qualify them and answer for them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We have inborn tendencies to all sorts of sin, stealing, lying, cheating,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you name it.  God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but that the world through Him might be saved.</i><br>
<p>
This statement seems to simplify homosexuality to the point of being<br>
a case of selfishness and self-seeking equal to "stealing, lying, and <br>
cheating."<br>
Are you ready to qualify your thoughts and biases?  What are the underlying<br>
issues in stealing, lying, and cheating?  Are the traits of <br>
selfishness, telling<br>
untruths to cover oneself found in the homosexual identity itself?<br>
<p>
Maybe getting back to basics isn't bad, a basics which goes beyond<br>
"Adam and Eve".  WHAT ARE RELATIONSHIPS?  ARE THEY A GIFT FROM<br>
GOD?  ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DRAW US TO A BETTER<br>
UNDERSTANDING *OF* AND RELATIONSHIP *WITH* GOD?  CAN THE<br>
GOD-GIVEN POWER OF CHOICE AND UNDERSTANDING BE EXPRESSED<br>
IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS?  ARE THEY REFLECTIONS OF THE<br>
COVENANT LOVE-RELATIONSHIP GOD HAS WITH HUMANS?  We might<br>
begin to find answers by addressing these questions.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we pay lip-service to Genesis 1 when it fits our needs, never allowing<br>
'woman' to be as equally "in the image of God" as 'man'.  A lot of it <br>
is cultural.<br>
What Jesus did, and said about women while on earth would have crashed<br>
like LED if it were done during earlier times in history (read: the <br>
fullness of time,<br>
the time being right).  Furthermore, it might not be a coincidence that <br>
God's call<br>
to homosexuals is happening at such a time as this (fullness of time).<br>
<p>
God's character as Creator can and is expressed in other ways than<br>
procreation.  This is not to say that procreation is of _low esteem_, <br>
it should be<br>
esteemed higher, much higher than it is currently.  Many of these other ways,<br>
"lower animals" can not duplicate.  Besides, some of the procreators are<br>
giving birth to homosexual children... now what do we do for the procreators<br>
who want to CREATE a loving and supportive world for their children?<br>
<p>
As the military of many a country show us, homosexuals have been nearly<br>
everywhere _already_.  So I don't doubt that they have been, are now, and will<br>
be teaching in our schools.  Shouldn't it be something to praise God for,<br>
instead of fearing the "unknown" - they still love God and seek to serve Him?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do "normal individuals" plaster the campus restrooms with graffiti saying</i><br>
<i>&gt;where and when anonymous sexual encounters may be had?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some say that the oppression came and forced the gays underground to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the various risky behaviors that they take.  It seems to me that this may</i><br>
<i>&gt;be revisionist history.</i><br>
<p>
"Normal individuals" do lots of things which can be questioned, and should<br>
be.  I suspect that when we question such a thing as anonymous sexual<br>
encounters, we might find a lot more than we expect.  We also might hear a<br>
call to action other than "police the area" (band-aid on ulcer).  One thing<br>
you might do, is to sponsor or assist in alternative non-erotic social,<br>
"community", or religious groups for gay and lesbian people.  And there are<br>
plenty of things in "history" which could use revision, or "telling the <br>
_whole_<br>
story" (ie:  US foreign relations, USSR'nt, women, race and more).<br>
So revising history is not an 'evil', unless someone perceiving her/himself to<br>
be an "insider", thinks that her/his place in life, gained through the <br>
partial truth,<br>
will be threatened by the WHOLE.<br>
<p>
Here's to the real lives, of real people restored to a right <br>
relationship with a<br>
REAL GOD - as expressed in Christ Jesus.<br>
<p>
Marcus -&gt;  How ARE homosexual students treated on our Adventist college<br>
campuses by faculty/staff/students?<br>

<i>&gt; I just saw the NBC made-for-TV movie about the events that led up to the raid</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the Mt. Carmel complex.  The Seventh-day Adventist church was never </i><br>
<i>&gt; mentioned by name, and oblique references were few.  The details seem </i><br>
<i>&gt; to match most of the other things we have heard.  Lots of shooting, lots</i><br>
<i>&gt; of preaching before the shooting. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
   I also watched that movie (something I rarely do).  There were things <br>
that disturbed me while I looked on... things the movie-makers were subtly <br>
suggesting.  One of the most disturbing things was hearing "Koresh" saying <br>
things _I_BELIEVE_ (world is coming to an end; what are we doing about it; <br>
shouldn't just sit back), along with the other fanatical things which are <br>
way off base.  <br>
<p>
   There is danger in mixing truth with error in such cases.  Poison is <br>
only deadly when mixed with healthy food.  It seems that the media (esp.<br>
TV) is terribly good at giving the good along with the deadly.  It seems <br>
that people who watched that "dramatization" would be desensitized to the <br>
gospel message.  Now if someone mentions quotes from the Bible or that s/he <br>
thinks the world is coming to an end, the response will laughter and scorn... <br>
"You're going off the deep end... gonna end up toasted like those wackos on <br>
Mt. Carmel." <br>
 <br>
   Also, I do believe that things were NOT quite like the way they were<br>
portrayed on TV.  They basically reflected everything the media has been<br>
saying.  Some of it's probably right... but I think it's the government's<br>
version of the story.<br>

Just a few thoughts on homosexuals and the church:<br>
<p>
How many of you netters have been hit upon repeatedly by a gay person?<br>
While working at Microsoft as a CO-OP student, I was.  And I still<br>
shudder to think about it.  Was it sexual harassment?  Yes!  Was anything<br>
done about it?  No.  I was laughted at for being hit on.  What happens<br>
if that happens in the church?  In our schools?<br>
<p>
Lest I be damned for waving a red shirt here, I have friends who are<br>
gay and who are lesbian.  And I care a great deal for them.  They<br>
have never tried to proposition or convince me that their persuasion<br>
was right.  And I haven't told them that they are going to hell.  If<br>
there is any justice, I think all three of them will make it into<br>
heaven, but that is not my call.<br>
<p>
I do not have a problem with gay or lesbians being in my church or<br>
teaching my children, should I get married and raise a family.<br>
However, if I found that they were actively pushing their sexual<br>
orientation, then I would have a problem with what they were doing.<br>
<p>
I guess what I'm trying to say is this:  If you are gay or straight<br>
doesn't matter to me.  What matters is that you display common<br>
decency in your sex related conduct.  I don't go around hitting on <br>
women.  (You can ask my girl-friend for verification of that.  It took<br>
me the longest time to get up the courage to ask her out.  ;-))  Just<br>
don't expect it as a gay right that you can go hitting on men if you<br>
are a man or women if you are a woman.  Fair?<br>
<p>
What do you think?  Next time you sit down at the potluck table, look<br>
at the people around you and ask yourself if it really would bother<br>
you to find out that one or two of them were gay.  I hope it doesn't,<br>
because if you don't know yet, I doubt they are any more sinner then<br>
you are.<br>

Harver Breneise quoted Gary Phillips as saying:<br>
<i>&gt; I come by these positions honorably: I have a degree in religious studies</i><br>
<i>&gt; and some additional seminary coursework. And I can read Greek, which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; often a claim that our detractors cannot make!</i><br>
<p>
Well folks, that just goes to show you how useless some of these degrees and<br>
seminary studies are. I don't mean to be rude, but really, a lot of stuff<br>
coming out of some of these seminaries just goes to show that the people in<br>
them either don't believe the bible, or don't read it, or both.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Terry, this is entirely correct. Not only is homosexuality a very tiny</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue in the bible, there are instances where gay relationships appear to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be accepted. Much of the furor over this issue among fundamentalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christians derives from mistranslation of a few specific verses. It's</i><br>
<p>
Would you believe it? The gay pastor my friend was communicating with said<br>
that David and Johnathan and Ruth and Naomi were homosexuals! I was entirely<br>
dumbfounded by this. It was so ridiculous that i was amazed that anyone<br>
could ever come up with this idea and actually believe it. I mean, if one<br>
believes this, one can believe just about anything, and make the bible say<br>
all sorts of things that it doesn't even hint at.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Don't let anyone use Sodom and Gomorrah as an argument, the issue there</i><br>
<i>&gt; had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with hospitality toward</i><br>
<i>&gt; strangers.</i><br>
<p>
Well, what about this then?:<br>
<p>
Jude 1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in<br>
like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going<br>
after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the<br>
vengeance of eternal fire. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Jude 1:7 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding<br>
towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.<br>
They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of<br>
eternal fire. (NIV)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Likewise, the words used by Paul in his epistles that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually translated as "homosexual" or "effeminate" could just as easily</i><br>
<i>&gt; be translated as "coward" or "weakling." Quotes from Leviticus are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most worthless of all: unless the person relying on Leviticus is also</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to condemn wearing of mixed fiber garments, wet dreams, women who</i><br>
<i>&gt; wear red, and eating of shellfish or shrimp.</i><br>
<p>
This person, despite all his greek and degrees, is obviously grasping at<br>
straws and trying to change what the bible says because he doesn't want to<br>
change his life.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; I think the preceding statement does justify the canceling of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; newsgroup, in that WWC is trying to get rid of newsgroups which</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; contradict the beliefs of SDA's.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm glad that the library I work for does not cancel subscriptions for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the reason given above.  As I've thought about this, I don't think</i><br>
<i>&gt; subscribing to newsgroups on a network is that different from</i><br>
<i>&gt; periodicals in the library.  The job of selection is a positive one in</i><br>
<i>&gt; which one chooses that which contributes to the institutional mission.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pronography and items of prurient interest do not, so are not selected.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is different than censorship.  Our library subscribes to journals</i><br>
<i>&gt; which contradict SDA beliefs.  We could hardly be a university and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; do so.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Andrews University</i><br>
<i>&gt; (brneise@andrews.edu)</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Sorry Harvey, I sent Steve three copies of the message and thought that<br>
I had changed this line in one of them.  What I meant to say is that I<br>
think this is why the university thought they justified themselves in<br>
canceling this newsgroup.  I totally agree with you that it is important<br>
also agree that newsgroups are similar to magazine subscriptions and<br>
should be chosen accordingly.  for a university to enable its students<br>
to become better educated.  Just thought I would clarify this point.<br>
<p>
Now going, I sent a message which I think was not posted.  It involved<br>
what I thought about the newsgroups.  I can't remember exactly what I<br>
said, but it went somewhat along the lines of what Harvey mentioned above.<br>
There are several newsgroups in the alt groups which do have value in them<br>
such as alt.internet.services, alt.politics.*, etc.  However, to read<br>
these groups currently I have to go elsewhere since we do not currently<br>
subscribe to these at Andrews.  It is a little more of a hassle to get<br>
to these newsgroups, but I have no real difficulty with it.  What I<br>
think though is that any of our universities (or whoever is in charge of the<br>
newsgroups) look at the validity of several of the alt newsgroups.  The only<br>
problem I see with this is that the alt newsgroups tend to disappear as<br>
quickly as they appear and they also tend to be umoderated, which is why<br>
it is harder to judge the content of the newsgroups.<br>
<p>
It's getting late here and I need my sleep.  I hope the above makes sense<br>
since I'm writing this so late at night.<br>

The approach I took of saying "There has to be right and wrongs" when <br>
addressing homosexuality is foreign to many people.  In fact, it's not my <br>
favorite approach, either, because I sound like Rush Limbaugh when I make<br>
those kind of arguments.  I suspect that some of our readers would be <br>
more comfortable with the approach of relationship theology.<br>
<p>
Relationship theology says, "My goal in life is to love God supremely<br>
and my neighbor as myself."  I think none would argue that we can love <br>
any neighbor as ourself, regardless of sex.  It is the question:  "What<br>
does this love entail?" where we may part ways.  <br>
<p>
Is there an additional committment that sexual love adds to a love<br>
relationship that is not there otherwise?  Is it necessary to participate<br>
in sex with someone in order to display love (or to seek love)?  <br>
Should sexual love be restricted to one person, a few (polygamy is permitted<br>
in the Bible, after all) or unrestricted?  I do not doubt that members<br>
of the same sex can live together and have committed and devoted<br>
relationships,<br>
but it is not obvious that sexual intimacy between them is either necessary<br>
or beneficial to achieving this goal.  I bring the hypothesis to this<br>
discussion that the Bible has something to say about these questions. <br>
Others claim it is between themselves and the Holy One.  If the<br>
understanding gap<br>
is to be bridged, we shall have to find a way to test the hypotheses.<br>
  I think we may take <br>
it as a principle that if we are to call something a sin, it should <br>
not be due to an arbitrary definition, there should be real and obvious<br>
detriment that occurs to our relationships with God and fellow humans.<br>
<p>
Consider the homosexual relationships of which you are aware (I must admit<br>
I am aware of precious few and those of which I am aware are not good ones.)<br>
Ask yourself what is the fruit of these actions.  A man moves out on his<br>
wife and children, leaving them without support, to live with his gay lover.<br>
Is this between him and the Holy One?!  I think not. <br>
<p>
As I expressed at the beginning of this thread, I am not comfortable with <br>
either scriptural interpretation of the various texts that are commonly<br>
used to talk about the Bible and homosexuality.  It is difficult to keep the <br>
texts which ban homosexuality without also keeping the texts which are used<br>
to hold women in the Stone Age.  If we continue down the logical path of <br>
that interpretation we arrive at the position of Paul VI and the Catholic<br>
church.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if we say for some reason that these texts do not apply,<br>
then the Bible has precious little to say about human relationships at all.<br>
I do not have an answer to this problem.  Although I have expounded the first<br>
position I realize it may be untenable.  I have not seen any good study<br>
on this topic.<br>
<p>
On one side it seems we have the black lie that says "Homosexuals are <br>
Bad People.  You shouldn't get near one or touch one.  And if you men<br>
show affection to another man, you are a Queer and we will never let <br>
you forget it."  <br>
( I think this attitude exacerbates the need of men to seek affection <br>
from other men, but I could be wrong.)<br>
<p>
On the other side we have the white lie that says "the homosexual<br>
relationship is perfectly natural and if you don't think so, you<br>
are a Homophobe and we don't have to listen to you."<br>
<p>
Oftentimes I've got a great "colorful alternative" to insert between<br>
black and white lie.  This time I don't.  But I wonder:<br>
<p>
In some cases (probably not a majority) homosexuality could be an <br>
"acting out" behavior of rebellion against strict standards that forbade it.<br>
If instead of looking for the root emotional cause of the rebellion<br>
we simply condone the behavior which is a symptom of the rebellion,<br>
we do the person a disservice, at least I think so.<br>
<p>
I have spoken before of a student (several years younger than myself)<br>
in South Africa, whom I counsel by mail.  In the past seven years she<br>
has been part of ANC, MDM, ECC, Adventist, agnostic, Catholic, and now<br>
lesbian.  I still give her as much moral support as I ever did, encouraging<br>
her to pursue her studies and her quest for truth.  I still show faith <br>
in her that she is acting in accord with her best moral judgment.<br>
But I do not condone her lesbian behavior (even though I expected it <br>
would eventually happen).  I don't think she expected me to condone it.<br>
(In fact, she held off telling me about it for several months after it <br>

love, give her support, and try to understand the motivations for her <br>
behavior without abandoning my own moral standard, and I think she respects<br>
me for that.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;We have inborn tendencies to all sorts of sin, stealing, lying, cheating,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you name it.  God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;but that the world through Him might be saved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;[MARCUS S.]</i><br>
<i>&gt;This statement seems to simplify homosexuality to the point of being</i><br>
<i>&gt;a case of selfishness and self-seeking equal to "stealing, lying, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;cheating."</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you ready to qualify your thoughts and biases?  What are the underlying</i><br>
<i>&gt;issues in stealing, lying, and cheating?  Are the traits of</i><br>
selfishness, &gt;telling untruths to cover oneself found in the homosexual<br>
identity itself?<br>
My point:  1)  If indeed homosexuality is an inborn trait, this does not<br>
a priori make it right.  Tendencies to other sins are also inborn.<br>
2)  Christ can save from any inborn or acquired tendency to sin.<br>
My bias:  I believe that any homosexual act violates the 7th commandment,<br>
"thou shalt not commit adultery."<br>
Now for some questions I can answer...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Maybe getting back to basics isn't bad, a basics which goes beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Adam and Eve".  WHAT ARE RELATIONSHIPS?  </i><br>
Relationships define identity.  We learn who we are by relating to <br>
other people.<br>
<i>&gt;ARE THEY A GIFT FROM GOD?  </i><br>
In general, yes.<br>
<i>&gt;ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DRAW US TO A BETTER</i><br>
<i>&gt;UNDERSTANDING *OF* AND RELATIONSHIP *WITH* GOD?  </i><br>
Yes<br>
<i>&gt;CAN THE GOD-GIVEN POWER OF CHOICE AND UNDERSTANDING BE EXPRESSED</i><br>
<i>&gt;IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS?  </i><br>
Yes<br>
<i>&gt;ARE THEY REFLECTIONS OF THE</i><br>
<i>&gt;COVENANT LOVE-RELATIONSHIP GOD HAS WITH HUMANS?  </i><br>
Yes<br>
We might begin to find answers by addressing these questions.<br>
<p>
Now the question which to my knowledge has no data to support the <br>
affirmative, although I am open to suggestions:<br>
Can a relationship which includes homosexual intercourse reflect<br>
the image of God as relationships ought to?<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Marcus -&gt;  How ARE homosexual students treated on our Adventist college</i><br>
<i>&gt;campuses by faculty/staff/students?</i><br>
<p>
In my day those that were caught got kicked out. (early 80's)  But only <br>
one got caught at AU that I heard of, and none were caught during<br>
my days in academy.<br>

<p>
I'm not sure what you mean, but i think we should show "Godly love" to<br>
everyone, all the time, it should never "end" and we should never condone<br>
sin at all. God loves us sinners, but that does not mean that He loves our<br>
sin. He loves us not because of who or what we are, but because of who He<br>
is. God _is_ love. I still don't see what the perceived contradiction is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There are people who are out to make sure that homosexuals do not have</i><br>
<i>&gt;jobs or homes... (especially if they are honest about who they are) where is</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Bible on this, where is the Church on this? If they support this type of</i><br>
<i>&gt;anti-gay work, why are they silent? If they reject it, why are they silent?</i><br>
<i>&gt;People are perishing, now isn't the time to be silent.</i><br>
<p>
Well, my own opinion is that if they are out of a job, we should help them<br>
find one, not because they are homosexual, but because they are people in<br>
need of work. Also, it is not the business of the church to go on a witch<br>
hunt or to stone sabbath breakers etc. The church seems to be silent i<br>
suppose, because it does not want to abe identified with either of the two<br>
sides which seem to be at war: the millitant anti gay movement or the gay<br>
activists. Both of these movements have the spirit of the enemy in them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The Sodom story isn't a good one to use against homosexuality.....</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;of the population...  Was Sodom an all-gay town?  If anything, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;destruction of Sodom is due to committing homosexual [rape] on</i><br>
<i>&gt;strangers if not angels.  Rape is more an issue of "power", self exalting,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Couple this with the societal beliefs regarding gender status, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;assumed meaning for the destruction applies less fittingly.</i><br>
<p>
Well, it was probably the sum total of all the evil in Sodom, that filled up<br>
its cup of wrath against it. The attempted rape of the angels was only the<br>
last straw. However, the fact that the sexual perversion of the Sodomites<br>
was one of the sins that added up to its destruction is evident, because<br>
elsewhere in the bible, sexual impurity is denounced in no uncertain terms.<br>
See also Jude 1:7.<br>

While in the dentists office I read an article in Discover magazine.<br>
It is a laymens science journal.<br>
<p>
This is somewhat preliminary science that seems to have some real<br>
substance to it -- more research needed.  The discovery being that<br>
pigs are excellent "mixing vessels" for the flu virus.  Pigs can<br>
catch human flu virus that other animals cannot catch.  Pigs can<br>
catch bird flu that other animals cannot catch.  Perhaps the flu<br>
of other animals.  What happens is that these flu virus take hold<br>
in a single host, the pig, and then genetics takes over.  So, the<br>
farmer goes out to feed his hogs.  He coughs his "cold" into his<br>
friendly hogs face.  The hog incubates that flu with other flu<br>
virus from birds, etc, and a few weeks later the farmer heads out<br>
to feed his hogs and the hog coughs the new virus into the farmers<br>
face.  The new virus can turn out to be deadly and can soon be<br>
sweeping around the world.  There is pretty good evidence, from<br>
DNA analysis, that some of the more deadly flus of recent years<br>
are very likely human/bird --&gt; hog --&gt; human in origen.<br>
<p>
The Bible says ". . . . . and none of these diseases will come<br>
nigh unto you".<br>
<p>
During the dark ages the Jews were often crowded into European<br>
ghetos.  Epidemiology would say they should have experienced a<br>
higher mortality rate.  But when the plagues of Europe swept through<br>
town the Jews did not die like flies like the rest of Europe.<br>
Why, because of the health laws of Moses.  In many cases this<br>
was used against them.  Mobs were insited against the Jews on<br>
the theory that the Jews must be the instigators of the disease<br>
because they were the only ones not dying of the disease.<br>

Dear SDA Netters,<br>
<p>
For weeks I have been reading messages on SDANet which generally defend<br>
homosexuals and condemn heterosexuals.  I have found the arguments used to<br>
defend homosexuals very subtle and very interesting.  Some have<br>
raised accusations against God and against His character for being<br>
"unfair" to homosexuals, but the most profound accusations have been made<br>
against God's Church for mistreating homosexuals.  Arguments have been<br>
made that "love" is all that matters and that as long as homosexuals<br>
"love" their partners and don't "rape" them, homosexuality should be<br>
acceptable to God.  An attitude of "live and let live" has been expressed<br>
toward gays.  Some have openly stated that their interpretation of the<br>
Bible allows for homosexuality and that Christians have as much right to a<br>
pro-homosexual interpretation of the Bible as to any other interpretation.<br>
<p>
Commendable views have been expressed, such as that Christians should not<br>
be hostile or condemnatory toward gays and that sexual perversion exists<br>
among heterosexuals.  <br>
<p>
Still, I am troubled.  The Advent message was founded on the<br>
understanding of two great institutions established by God at the creation<br>
of the earth: (1) the Sabbath and (2) marriage between a man and a woman. <br>
These two institutions are at the core, the bottom line, of our faith and our<br>
hope. <br>
<p>
Adventists believe that Satan has been actively seeking to obliterate the<br>
meaning and importance of the Sabbath institution.  We also believe he has<br>
been seeking to do the same to the heaven-ordained union between husband<br>
and wife.  Satan's work ***does*** involve perversions and corruptions of<br>
a heterosexual nature, but it does ***definitely*** also involve<br>
homosexuality, the Satanic counterfeit of God's perfect plan.<br>
<p>
Homosexuality is, in my view, not defendable from Scripture, and<br>
expositors have to take great liberties with God's Word in their attempts<br>
to defend what God plainly calls sin.   Also, there is a disturbing<br>
attempt to focus ***only*** on God's love, while totally ignoring the very<br>
real attributes of His justice and intolerance for sin.  Yes, God is<br>
unwilling that any should perish, but NO, He will not save people in their<br>
sins.  Individuals who cling to what the Bible and God's Spirit plainly<br>
declare as sin, such as homosexuality, will simply not be "safe" to save.<br>
<p>
The Scriptures are not subject to private interpretation.  God's<br>
Word interprets itself as we compare Scripture with Scripture.  It's very<br>
uplifting for us to dwell on God's great love for humanity (John 3:16),<br>
but we must never lose sight of God's justice, for it is because God is<br>
just that our dear Savior Jesus Christ had to receive the penalty that we<br>
deserved in order to bring salvation to us.  The magnitude of sin is seen<br>
in the torture endured by the spotless Son of God.  <br>
<p>
The same hands that created the Universe were nailed to Golgotha's cross,<br>
as Jesus paid the penalty for all us sinners, including the homosexuals. <br>
Yet if we persist in deliberate and continued sin, we, like they, will be<br>
eternally lost.  God is fair.  He is just.  He is interested in assuring<br>
that when sin is cleansed from the earth, it shall not arise a second<br>
time.  The safety and peace of the Universe will be assured forever.<br>
<p>
We may want to force God's Word to our viewpoint, but it just doesn't<br>
work that way.  We must humble ourselves to that which God has revealed<br>
to us.  Homosexuality is a perversion and a sin, no more and no<br>
less so than heterosexual perversions, and the unrepentant homosexuals,<br>
like all unrepentant sinners, will perish in their sins.<br>

My wife ran into someone standing in line at somewhere when she was <br>
trying to get a car titled for her sister.  The woman stated that she had<br>
2 sons that worked for ATF and were involved in the Waco raid.  she told<br>
my wife that it was a move to garner publicity, and if it had work out, they<br>
would have hit another target up in the northwest. (She told me the state, but<br>
I don't remember). for what it is worth.<br>

Steve,<br>
	You should either tell people who include the whole of a prior<br>
post in thier reply to quit it, or else edit it.  Sure is a pain to have<br>
to deal with.  (I used to be guilty of it, because I had no way to<br>
edit my replies (I didn't know how to run VI).  I got stomped on pretty<br>
heavily, and eventually learned to use VI<br>

Thanks for your reply to my question, Ron. In fact, it was an<br>
inquiring question rather than a leading question, so your<br>
assumptions about my own personal position are not correct.<br>
<p>
If you want to know my regular position on this topic, you need<br>
to read what I wrote to "Dan" on bit.listserv.christia a few<br>
months back. In fact, it was that conversation that prompted me<br>
to do some more reading on the inspiration/revelation thing. One<br>
argument I came across, and which sounded reasonable, is that<br>
there are no "degrees of inspiration". (I had heard this before,<br>
but never checked it out carefully). So either EGW was "inspired"<br>
(interpret that how you will) or she wasn't.<br>
<p>
So I am currently asking myself these questions: do I see the <br>
inspiration of EGW any differently to the inspiration of the<br>
prophets of old? If so, why? Why do I respect the authority of,<br>
say, Jeremiah's prophetic writings more than those of Ellen White?<br>
If the type of inspiration is similar from one prophet to another,<br>
what differences can there be between the canonical and non-canonical<br>
literary prophets? Plus a whole lot of related things.<br>
<p>
My preliminary findings are few and far between at this stage, hence<br>
my question. I'm trying to find out what others think and why, <br>
particularly those who take a similar stance to me! (Like Ron.)<br>
One thing I would say is this: people are far more prepared to<br>
contextualize Scripture than they are Ellen White. This is despite<br>
the fact that sociological changes in this century alone are <br>
probably equally profound as those between the time of Christ and<br>
the nineteenth century. Well, maybe not quite, but you get my drift!<br>
Hence I have become accustomed to making cultural allowances for<br>
Paul and Peter, but not for Ellen White. Many fundamentalist SDAs I <br>
know have quoted EGW far more than the Bible; after all, her writings<br>
are quite substantial and, combined with their high quote coefficient,<br>
this gives a large quote potential.<br>
<p>
Maybe I will conclude that there is a lot more in common between EGW<br>
and canonical prophets than I have cared to admit in the past. And<br>
that if I use the same hermeneutic to study her writings as I apply<br>
to the Scripture, I may benefit equally from them. I don't know!<br>
<p>

Hi Steve Hix,<br>
<p>
I've got some questions.  Do you know of the gun or weapons<br>
magazines at your local news stand?  Have you seen the advertisers<br>
and "do it yourself" tips on "making" your special weapon (usually<br>
not a type of gun for killing animals)?  Can you think of all the people<br>
living in Atlanta, Chicago, or Houston who are hunters (of non-human<br>
animals) and will use their gun for that purpose (often there is more<br>
than one gun owned)?  Obviously "good" gun owners are getting the<br>
pinch because of a few and increasing number of "bad" gun owners.<br>
The NRA did not BUDGE to correct itself until enough concerned<br>
people brought them onto the carpet - so the picture isn't so pretty.<br>
<p>
The problem does seem to be that too many guns are being used<br>
successfully in cases where humans are being killed.  Now those<br>
who advocate gun ownership rights must take responsibility for<br>
reform.  Hopefully the "reform" will be much more than effective<br>
ownership laws (see: my post about root causes).<br>
<p>
However, there are supposedly "believers" in this world, who's lives<br>
and philosophy should make a positive difference in life - correct?<br>
So what might the Church (SDA specifically) do to help curb the rise<br>
in violent crimes in general, and gun-use crimes specifically?<br>
<p>
You did say that you're a member of the NRA?  Maybe you or others<br>
who support gun-ownership, can give tips on what to do and where to<br>
do it.<br>
<p>
Marcus<br>

<i>&gt;Consider the homosexual relationships of which you are aware (I must admit</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am aware of precious few and those of which I am aware are not good ones.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ask yourself what is the fruit of these actions.  A man moves out on his</i><br>
<i>&gt;wife and children, leaving them without support, to live with his gay lover.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Is this between him and the Holy One?!  I think not.</i><br>
<p>
"The man moving out on his wife" seems be an increasingly rare one.<br>
Some say they married in hopes to "change" themselves, others say that<br>
it was a necessary "cover".  I think of marriage in a much higher state <br>
than to<br>
be used for such things.  If people have been driven to do things like this,<br>
then the things or societal beliefs which drive them are wrong (formal and<br>
sometimes relational separation of husband/father and wife/children) and not<br>
of **Christ**.<br>
<p>
I along with many others, do not say that the Bible is irrelevant in <br>
the area of<br>
human relations.  To the contrary, the Bible has beautiful EVERLASTING<br>
__principles__ for human relationships.  The problem is not a silence on<br>
this matter, but a RAPING of the Bible by those who for centuries, have<br>
interpreted it to fit their bigotry and prejudice.  It is only fitting <br>
that these last<br>
days, have many "called out" people speaking out for the "healing" of the<br>
scriptures which we've raped.<br>

Well, the sins of Sodom are all around us these days:<br>
<p>
Eze 16:49-50 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,<br>
fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters,<br>
neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were<br>
haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as<br>
I saw good. (KJV)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;scripture to support their belief in homosexuality = bad, but will not lift</i><br>
<i>&gt;a finger to lighten the burdens of those weighted down.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and besides helping tham materially, we need to help them as<br>
homosexuals, to change their lifestyle of sin; but some of them don't want<br>
this type of help although they need it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Again, regarding Jude 1:7, what type of sexual liaisons are these impurities?</i><br>
<i>&gt;What is the perception of the people, what do they associate these liaisons</i><br>
<i>&gt;with? What is the actual liaison as to what we know today?  Do we know less</i><br>
<i>&gt;than they about these things?  Has knowledge increased _everywhere_ else</i><br>
<i>&gt;SAVE in this instance?</i><br>
<p>
Well, i don't know how we can think that we know less. It seems self-evident<br>
to me at least, that homosexual liaisons are included in the abominable sins<br>
of Sodom. The bible is unclear on matter matters, but it condemns<br>
homosexuality in no uncertain terms. There's no two ways about it, its an<br>
abomination, a sin.<br>

Tang Ben,<br>
<p>
A text, OUT OR CONTEXT, is a pretext (LLU religion prof.).  It seems that the<br>
CLOBBER texts are in good use.  Focusing on the argument again.<br>
"Fornicator" or no-fornicator, WE have to answer for our words and deeds,<br>
Tang.  Some people who have studied these self same texts come to a<br>
different conclusion than you do (I'm one).  The Church must answer for its<br>
words and deeds.  If there is difference in interpretating the same <br>
text, and the<br>
Church ignores it or snowballs over it in order to keep its traditions <br>
- the Church<br>
must answer to God.<br>
<p>
In this we know for sure, when we bash from the pulpit or in our homes we<br>
send out a message which manifests itself in words and ways of sin.<br>
This bashing has no less effect on the persons spirit than a pipe, <br>
smashed into<br>
someone's face.  Repeatedly, I've suggested that we turn our eyes back to Jesus<br>
when dealing with this issue.  The reason?  Because we are dealing with real<br>
humans, whom we are tempted to demonize  - and whom we are quite ignorant<br>
about.<br>
<p>
As for Jude 1:7 saying "They committed fornication and followed unnatural<br>
lusts."  Again, granted that homosexual sexual expression is wrong, WHAT<br>
TYPE OF SEXUAL ACT WAS REALLY BEING SOUGHT BY **ALL** THE<br>
MEN OF SODOM WITH **TWO** MEN/ANGELS?  I'm told that the apocryphal<br>
text which Jude seems to be making an allusion to, uses literal Greek phrasing<br>
which anticipates these questions by using words which specify "going after<br>
alien or other or strange flesh".  Homosexual _rape_ is WRONG - yes!<br>
The heterosexual rape which Lot offers as alternative instead was JUST AS<br>
wrong  - at least from what we now know about females being equal humans<br>
too!  The word of God is deeper and richer than we can ever experienced it,<br>
don't be afraid and close your eyes, when you see different things at <br>
different<br>
depths.<br>
<p>
Eze 16:49-50 does show us that sins of Sodom are found everywhere today.<br>
Yet only one gets *legalized* discrimination (granted that homosexual<br>
relationships are a sin), or the wrath of religious fundamentalists.  <br>
There are<br>
more "abominations" discussed in scripture, than "homosexuality" (granted<br>
that our knowledge of sexuality and gender status has grown no farther than<br>
their was then).  "Lying lips" are one of them.  If we neglect to tell <br>
the whole truth<br>
especially when there is opportunity to learn the whole truth of the <br>
matter, we lie.<br>
This is why the Church should deal with this issue a little less pompously.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, and besides helping tham materially, we need to help them as</i><br>
<i>&gt;homosexuals, to change their lifestyle of sin; but some of them don't want</i><br>
<i>&gt;this type of help although they need it.</i><br>
<p>
Even if a homosexual needs to change her/his orientation or stop being<br>
sexual with another homosexual, the church has skipped step 1 for step 2.<br>
Jesus shows us by example, how to relate to people... human need first,<br>
spiritual need second, never letting the two cancel out each other.  We still<br>
have practical business to take care of at "step 1".  This is what the <br>
discussion<br>
on SDAnet should be about.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, i don't know how we can think that we know less. It seems self-evident</i><br>
<i>&gt;to me at least, that homosexual liaisons are included in the abominable sins</i><br>
<i>&gt;of Sodom. The bible is unclear on matter matters, but it condemns</i><br>
<i>&gt;homosexuality in no uncertain terms. There's no two ways about it, its an</i><br>
<i>&gt;abomination, a sin.</i><br>
<p>
Again, this is your opinion.  You still must deal with the real humans, <br>
and lives<br>
when you finish reciting text.  But be sure you're informed when <br>
speaking a "true"<br>
witness to, for, about or against your neighbor.<br>

Dear SDAnetters,<br>
<p>
In the past few weeks there have been a lot of posts on Koresh, guns and<br>
homosexuality.  While these are important topics, they're also getting<br>
to be a little on the heavy side.<br>
<p>
So, in the spirit of Ecclesiastes ("There is a time to weep and a time<br>
to laugh...."), I'm asking if anyone out there knows of any BBS's<br>
devoted to animation.  Lists for fans of Japanese animation ("anime")<br>
would be especially appreciated.  I have an address for fans of "The<br>
Simpsons" but am also looking for something a little more broad<br>
spectrum.  Thanks in advance.<br>
<p>

David,<br>
<p>
I suspect that, a woman faces this behavior more than once in a month.<br>
This doesn't make it any better at all.  I don't know the logistics of your<br>
situation, but a firm "no", then report to a supervisor, and on up the ladder<br>
should have had the situation under control in a hurry.  Acceptance<br>
should not be a license for harassment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I do not have a problem with gay or lesbians being in my church or</i><br>
<i>&gt;teaching my children, should I get married and raise a family.</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, if I found that they were actively pushing their sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt;orientation, then I would have a problem with what they were doing.</i><br>
<p>
This standard should be understood for teachers or preachers in general.<br>
But think about it?  You have school events where teacher/staff bring their<br>
"families"...  Teacher shows up in church with partner every Sabbath,<br>
they use the same car, go to the same home, invite members to that home<br>
for Sabbath dinner?  Maybe there's a "singles ministry" at church and<br>
people wonder why they don't attend?  How does one, NOT push ones<br>
sexual orientation in these cases?  They are not out waving flags or<br>
shouting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Just don't expect it as a gay right that you can go hitting on men if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;are a man or women if you are a woman.  Fair?</i><br>
<p>
This shouldn't be a right or winked at as a "boys will be boys" as with the<br>
infamous "Spurs posse" case here in the USA.<br>
<p>
Your opinion is a bit more open than most.<br>
<p>

Since this topic has come up again on SDAnet, I'd like to make<br>
some comments about the incidents at Waco.  These comments are<br>
all supported by at least 2 or 3 sources.  Apparently the<br>
tanks with battering rams damaged the stairwells of the<br>
complex, making it difficult to get from place to place.<br>
Also, according to people who escaped, the tanks started the<br>
fire by knocking over several lanterns.  In addition, the<br>
holes punched by the tanks in the walls of the complex<br>
helped to fan the flames, as reported by the government<br>
inquiry.  In addition, the tear gas used will not spontaneously<br>
ignite but will burn if it comes in contact with open flame.<br>
So it seems quite possible that the FBI agents (unintentionally)<br>
made it hard for the people to escape, then started, fanned,<br>
and fueled the fire.<br>
<p>
As for their reasons for going in, it's possible that the<br>
stress of being under surveillance accentuated the wierd<br>
tendencies of the group.<br>

Marcus called on me to be willing to admit my biases.  I did so.<br>
Now I think it is only fair that those who say the Bible supports<br>
homosexual behavior, including him, admit their biases.  I will not<br>
presume to say (yet) what they may be but it is clear that they do exist.<br>
<p>
Marcus, what are the principles of Biblical interpretation that lead you<br>
to believe that I am "Raping" the bible when I say that it says homosexuality<br>
is wrong.  It seems that you must begin with the hypothesis that <br>
1) homosexuality is ok and 2) the Bible must be interpreted not <br>
to contradict this.  Certainly you have presented no evidence to bolster<br>
either of these points.  Do you think that all that has to be done is to <br>
explain away the few texts that are usually used, and then say "because it <br>
is not prohibited, it is OK?"<br>
<p>
Part of the reason I feel the way I do is that I know of no case personally<br>
where a gay person really is happy and gay.  If the proponents were pointing<br>
to happy families with dad and dad and two kids or mom and mom and kids<br>
it would be different.  All the personal cases I know and all the statistics<br>
I hear suggest that homosexuality is a high-risk behavior in which <br>
monogamy is rare.  For that matter, if the bible allows homosexuality,<br>
why worry about monogamy, because polygamy is known and permitted in the Bible?<br>
<p>
I will agree with Marcus on one point and that is that there should be <br>
a division between the church's responses to homosexual people and <br>
whatever our theology is.  We are called first to love. "Love first, <br>
ask questions later" as it were.  From all my experiences (limited though<br>
they are) homosexual behavior is a divisive force in relationships,<br>
destroying them wherever it appears.  Christians are called to rise above<br>
our beliefs, and our reactions to this behavior and be ready to show the <br>
love of Christ to whomever.<br>
<p>

I did not say in this instance, that _you_, Steve Timm, have raped the Bible.<br>
What I said was, "I along with many others, do not say that the Bible is<br>
irrelevant in the area of human relations.  To the contrary, the Bible has<br>
beautiful EVERLASTING __principles__ for human relationships.<br>
The problem is not a silence on this matter, but a RAPING of the Bible by<br>
**those who for centuries, have interpreted it to fit their bigotry and <br>
prejudice**."<br>
<p>
The key phrase is those who interpret scripture to fit their bigotry and<br>
prejudice.  Interpreting scripture out of context, or without the whole<br>
background information.  If "those" means Marcus Stringer, then I am living<br>
outside of the principles and character of Jesus Christ.  The Jewish nation in<br>
Jesus' day don't own the market on this.  This is something which we all must<br>
be careful about.<br>
<p>
Heterosexuality = the physical, mental, emotional, spiritual attraction to a<br>
person of the opposite gender.  Homosexuality = the physical, mental,<br>
emotional, spiritual attraction to a person of the same gender.  Scientific<br>
study shows that this happens.  The belief that what has been toted to<br>
be fact about homosexuality, may not actually be the whole story, is the<br>
beginning.  Anyone might come to that cognitive dissonance either by being<br>
a homosexual, or having a friend or loved one who is a homosexual.<br>
This relationship will play a part in the need to know about it, as the <br>
fear and<br>
ignorance of the same might play a part in a need NOT to know or the<br>
need to refute alternative thought about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Do you think that all that has to be done is to explain away the few texts</i><br>
<i>&gt;that are usually used, and then say "because it is not prohibited, it is OK?"</i><br>
<p>
No, I believe that what needs to be done is a careful, full context study<br>
of scripture on any issue - currently focussing on the homosexuality issue.<br>
Getting informed through scripture should not be divorced from being<br>
informed through knowing the reality of the actual human needs and<br>
experiences.  Christ has already exemplified how to do this.  I must<br>
advertise the book "The Desire of Ages", it is a most invaluable gift<br>
from God to us.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Part of the reason I feel the way I do is that I know of no case personally</i><br>
<i>&gt;where a gay person really is happy and gay.  If the proponents were pointing</i><br>
<i>&gt;to happy families with dad and dad and two kids or mom and mom and kids</i><br>
<i>&gt;it would be different.</i><br>
<p>
I know of "happy" couples, some of them are Seventh-day Adventist.<br>
Granted that they aren't so happen when they are disfellowshiped,<br>
denied employment or housing, when their son or daughter gets in trouble<br>
at school, when one is in the hospital and the other is being refused <br>
visitation<br>
or when they're being "demonized" by people who have no real knowledge<br>
of who they are.  Essentially they are no more or less, "happy" than we'd<br>
expect heterosexuals to be in those same situations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;All the personal cases I know and all the statistics</i><br>
<i>&gt;I hear suggest that homosexuality is a high-risk behavior in which</i><br>
<i>&gt;monogamy is rare.  For that matter, if the bible allows homosexuality,</i><br>
<i>&gt;why worry about monogamy, because polygamy is known and permitted</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the Bible?</i><br>
<p>
This was the same for me until I read more books, and met more people.<br>
I think that a lot of behavior which is attributed to homosexuality or the<br>
homosexual "lifestyle", is not of homosexuality at all, rather it is <br>
sludge from<br>
being "cast out" of society for millennia.  Homosexuals have been denied the<br>
opportunity to live "in the day", as it were.  Then the "moralists" go <br>
into the<br>
"night" to point the finger.  However, they are not pointing at a <br>
problem, but to<br>
the problems fruit or "run off". Don't bother trying to imagine Christ <br>
in this picture,<br>
I've tried.  He and the principles of His character are nowhere to be found.<br>
The problem, is that humans have been oppressed without us knowing the full<br>
truth or because we'd rather _not_ know it  I'd not be good in supporting<br>
polygamy (at least for myself) because of my concept of my preferred type of<br>
relationship.  "One on one" is difficult enough.  However, I'd speak <br>
out if they<br>
were being denied their human rights as Christ acknowledged them.<br>

I too read an article several years ago concerning flu and hogs. Most new<br>
virus' originate in southeast asia where aqua farming is predominant. The<br>
article discussed a theory about the origins of these new virus'. Each<br>
family has a pond in which they grow rice. They also raise a couple type<br>
of carp in these ponds. Each pond has a pig pen built over it so that<br>
the pigs may fertilize the pond. The farmers also raise ducks on these same<br>
ponds. Ducks also are carriers of an avian flu virus but as I recall it<br>
doesn't infect pigs. Instead it infects humans. The pig virus' also infects<br>
humans. The humans act as "mixing vessels" for these flu's which may<br>
occasionally invade the same human cell where DNA is mixed. Occasionally<br>
a new viable flu is produced. Viola! A Swine flu or Hong Kong flu.<br>
<p>
Another article discussed research into the spread of flu virus' and how<br>
the correlated to duck migratory patterns. A possible explaination for<br>
the annual flu seasons as the ducks migrate through the area. It also<br>
mentioned how the ponds in northern Canada function as stew pots for<br>
these avian flus.<br>
<p>
Does anyone know if duck is forbidden food?<br>

Noe,<br>
<p>
I'll have to read messages from other "netters", but at least I have <br>
not argued<br>
against heterosexuality.  And if it seems that I have, arguing against<br>
heterosexuality was not my intention.<br>
<p>
Noe, the Adventist message was founded on the Sabbath, the Sanctuary,<br>
and Second Coming.  The main point of these should be Christ, and not the<br>
event or place, in and of itself.  Marriage, a symbol of a covenant <br>
should not be<br>
separated from the true meaning it was meant to reflect - God covenanting,<br>
committing Himself to humans, ultimately in the form of Jesus.  Homosexuality<br>
need not obliterate the meaning and importance of marriage between a husband<br>
and wife.<br>
<p>
I'm an Adventist, grew up in an Adventist home, but the belief that <br>
homosexuality<br>
_in and of itself_, being the work of Satan to destroy heterosexuality, <br>
is not a part<br>
of my belief.  Neither is a person's ethnicity, or physical disability <br>
being God's<br>
manifest displeasure on that person or the person's parents.  Nor is the view<br>
that the earth is the center of the Universe, a part of what I believe. <br>
 So neither<br>
you nor I can speak for ALL Adventists.<br>
<p>
As I've said to others on the net, granted that homosexuality is a sin, we as<br>
professed followers of Christ are a part of this world.  If people are <br>
being killed,<br>
fired, or made homeless because of their homosexuality, and we remain silent,<br>
we commit sin.  To we who know to do good AND DO IT NOT, to us it is sin.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Homosexuality is, in my view, not defendable from Scripture, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;expositors have to take great liberties with God's Word in their attempts</i><br>
<i>&gt;to defend what God plainly calls sin.</i><br>
<p>
This is good, it is your view which you are entitled to.  But you/we are NOT<br>
entitled to make a club out of scripture, to beat over people's head *without*<br>
you/us knowing the full reality of the situation, _That_ is what I'm saying to<br>
SDAnet.  As far as taking "great liberties", great liberties were taken <br>
in ending<br>
the tradition of enslaving, segregating, and discriminating against my<br>
foreparents &gt;as some supported it from the Bible&lt;.  And there is the furor now,<br>
and violence (act/word) as there was then.  I interpret your phrase <br>
"taking great<br>
liberties" to mean that I take liberty the invitation to prayerfully <br>
"dig in" in search<br>
of the "hidden pearls" in scripture (in context), free from pre-imposed <br>
prejudiced<br>
opinion.  If so, then I'm guilty, praise God!  I recommend again, that <br>
people read<br>
the introduction to "The Great Controversy" which talks about <br>
inspiration of the<br>
Bible the role between the human and divine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;God's Word interprets itself as we compare Scripture with Scripture.  </i><br>
It's very<br>
<i>&gt;uplifting for us to dwell on God's great love for humanity (John </i><br>
3:16), but we must<br>
<i>&gt;never lose sight of God's justice, for it is because God is just that </i><br>
our dear Savior<br>
<i>&gt;Jesus Christ had to receive the penalty that we deserved in order to </i><br>
bring salvation<br>
<i>&gt;to us.  The magnitude of sin is seen in the torture endured by the </i><br>
spotless Son of God.<br>
<p>
As I've said before, Text - Context = Pretext.  The Son of God came eating and<br>
drinking with publicans and "sinners" too.  God's justice is <br>
everlasting, and it takes<br>
into consideration, the WHOLE picture, which we cannot, or will to not see.<br>
Thanks be to Christ, who endured bashing, "demonization", and death for ALL,<br>
and who is returning in terrible justice against the same.<br>
                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>

<i>&gt;The basis of American culture, and success is the concept of the free</i><br>
<i>&gt;man, with land.  Our founding fathers adopted the philosphy that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;only way to be truely free, is to be able to hold (own) land, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;means to defend it.  Guns have been traditionaly, the weapons of</i><br>
<i>&gt;choice.  An armed, freeman is the best insurance against tyranny.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thus gun ownership is critical to making the US what it is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cheers</i><br>
<i>&gt;Woody</i><br>
<p>
I hear this argument all the time.  "The founding fathers said.....",<br>
or "the founding fathers adopted the philosophy that...".   Now I do<br>
believe that the founding fathers did express a great deal of wisdom<br>
in the bill off rights and the constitution.  But this is 1992.<br>
There are some aspects of life that do not apply to modern day<br>
soceity.  The large urban cities with their drug and crime and<br>
poverty did not exist.  We must study present day culture and try to<br>
understand what is needed for this time.<br>
<p>
It reminds me of those in our church will give as a reason for<br>
everything, "Mrs White said..." without taking into consideration the<br>
context, the age in which she wrote, or even the person(s) to who she<br>
was speaking.  Were the founding Fathers inerrant or infallible?<br>
I certainly believe that the document they wrote was one of the best<br>
ever written, But come on now, we have problems that they never<br>
dreamed of, or probably could never have imagined.  That's why there<br>
are amendments to the constitution.<br>
<p>
So long folk,<br>

Some on the net may be aware that a new SDA-related journal has just<br>
been published entitled _Adventist Today_.  I have received 2 copies in<br>
the last few days.  It is published in Loma Linda, and the editor is former<br>
Review editor Raymond Cottrell, now retired.<br>
<p>
The Waco affair is the feature of the first issue.  The articles are as<br>
follows:  <br>
<p>
The Waco Cult &amp; Religion<br>
  Ex-Adventists at Mr. Carmel:  PR Problem or Learning Opportunity?<br>
  History and Fatal Theology of the Branch Davidians<br>
  Interview with Pastor Charlie Liu<br>
  The Waco Syndrome<br>
  David Koresh:  Narcissistic Personality or Dynsfunctional Religious<br>
Leader<br>
  Experiences in Loma Linda<br>
  Koresh on Ellen White<br>
<p>
Report:  LSU and LLU--After the Divorce<br>
<p>
Adventists &amp; Abortion<br>
  Pro-Life and Pro-Choice:  Can the Church Have It Both Ways?<br>
  1992 Annual Council Guidelines<br>
  A Higher Calling<br>
  Myths and Maybes<br>
  Finding a Consensus<br>
<p>
Editorial:  Let Freedom Ring<br>
Guide Editorial:  Inauguration of a President<br>
Perspective:  A Joyful Moan<br>
Mission Statement<br>
<p>
I have not had time yet to read any of it, but it looks worthwhile to<br>
me.  It may well provide an additional useful information source and<br>
discussion forum (when will we start an electronic journal?).  I have no<br>
connection to this publication and hope provision of this information is<br>
not construed as commercial use of the Internet.  The individual<br>
subscription is $18, $12 for students, $29 for institutions (of course,<br>
they always soak us for more!), $10 additional for outside North<br>
America.  The address is Adventist Today, PO Box 1220, Loma Linda, CA<br>
92354-1220.<br>
<p>
In speaking to Roy Branson (editor of _Spectrum_) while he was at the<br>
All Nations Church recently, he indicated that Waco would be a major<br>
topic of the next issue of _Spectrum_.  He also expressed interest in an<br>
article about Adventists and the Internet, including this list.  If<br>
something isn't in the pipeline (and he didn't seem aware that something<br>
was), perhaps we should get something going in his journal or in others<br>
like _Adventist Today_.  I still think we need to "go after" the<br>
official press as well.  If the _Review_ isn't interested, how about the<br>
_Journal of Adventist Education_ or even _Ministry_.  Somehow we need to<br>
get the word out.  Perhaps our time would be better spent that way than<br>
flaming each other on controversial topics about which we will probably<br>
never reach consensus.<br>

In reading through the postings of those who defend homosexuality, I have to ask<br>
some questions...<br>
<p>
The underlying question is this...is homosexuality a sin in God's eyes (not<br>
yours, God's)?  This would have to be based and determined from His word, the<br>
Bible.  If it can be determined that it is sin, then the defense of this<br>
perversion is not possible.  (Just to clerify, I speak of the practice, not the<br>
person involved).<br>
<p>
There are cases in the Bible where God had homosexuals destroyed due to their<br>
sins.  It is worth noting that they were killed specifically because of this and<br>
other sexual perversions and they were killed right away, as opposed to letting<br>
them live out their lives to a normal age.  I have to ask why judge them now and<br>
kill them versus waiting for natural death?  Because He did not want to let this<br>
"diesease" spread in the community.  To back this up, just read the chapter in<br>
Patriarchs and Prophets on Sodom and Gamorah.<br>
<p>
Even if there was only ONE story in the Bible where this perversion was spelled<br>
out, judged on the spot, and executed because of the perversion, would that not<br>
be enough reason to call it abominable to the Lord and flee from this practice??<br>
 Or do we simply try to rationalize it away by saying that God really wasn't<br>
killing them for that reason, or thoses individuals were a unique case and not<br>
applicable to today?<br>
<p>
I believe there is ample evidence that homosexuality is a perversion and<br>
therefore a sin, in the Bible.  If you want to pursue some references, I can<br>
research them for you.<br>
<p>
Then there is the writings of EGW.  Do we throw those out as well, for the sake<br>
of condoning this perversion?<br>
<p>
If we can agree that this is indeed a sin, then we can proceed, otherwise we<br>
have no starting point in common in which to discuss this.  For me this whole<br>
issue is not whether I like it or not, BUT does God like it or not?  If we can't<br>
agree on that, then how can we talk about how to treat these people?<br>
<p>
So then the question comes up...what do we do with these people?  How do we<br>
treat them?<br>
<p>
If it is a sin, then we can treat these people as we would anyone else (you, me,<br>
everybody).  We are all sinners.  Marcus asked how to hate the sin and not the<br>
sinner?  How would you do that if it were your son who had done something very<br>
wrong (in your eyes)?  Maybe he robbed a bank, killed someone, gotten hooked on<br>
cocaine.  Do you tell him "hey, its ok with me that you did these things"?  Do<br>
you kick him out of the house and tell him you never want to see him again in<br>
your life?  No, you still love him and treat him as a human being deserving of<br>
such.  But you let him know that the behavior is unacceptible.  For those who<br>
you are not in charge of, you can still communicate that you don't accept the<br>
behavior but will support them in their struggle.  We should not discriminate<br>
against them any more than we do others with sin problems in their lives.<br>
<p>
I dont think Christ would ignore or shun the homosexual as far as interacting<br>
with them.  When they were ready to stone the women, Jesus said he who is not<br>
guilty of sin may cast the first stone.  When all had left, he told the woman to<br>
go and SIN NO MORE.  He loved her and stood up for her BUT then let her know<br>
that her behavior was not right and to stop it.<br>
<p>
The homosexual lifestyle is a private choice as is any other choice of a sinful<br>
lifestyle (such as a heterosexual relationship living together out of wedlock).<br>
 But it loses its privateness when teachers or others start promoting it (as<br>
they will do) in the classroom or elsewhere.  I would not want my kid's teachers<br>
telling directly or indirectly that their lifestyle is an "alternative" that is<br>
ok.  In my mind it is not ok (from what I read is God's perspective).  Sin is<br>
private as long as it only affects those who chose to sin.  It is no longer<br>
private when it involves others who don't consent or are unsuspecting, such as<br>
kids.<br>

At the request of Dick Dower I submitted an article to the Lake Union <br>

I take it you are excluding yourself from the "moralists"?  If a moralist is<br>

What human rights are homosexuals being denied?  You seem to like to tell us<br>
about how mistreated they are, but the ones that I have seen around here, they<br>
don't seem to be in too bad a shape.  I am not suggesting that some are not, but<br>
what percentage are we talking about here?  How far should we go in fighting for<br>
their rights over someone else's rights.  Many people have their rights<br>
violated.  That doesn't make it right.  But why single out the homosexuals?<br>
 Lets be fighting against all violated human rights.  I get the feeling from<br>
many of them interviewed on TV that they think they deserve a special status in<br>
society.<br>

Well, it seems that all the various arguments have been given on both <br>
sides of the homosexuality issue and now the only thing left is to <br>
repeat them louder.  Before we do that, let's step back and analyze.<br>
We have here a situation of diametrically opposed arguments, but also <br>
a situation of two totally different purposes.<br>
<p>
Most on the anti side, including myself, have been attempting to answer<br>
the question "Is homosexuality right or wrong?" and answering it "yes,<br>
it is wrong."<br>
<p>
If I read the posts of Marcus, I see a different concern.  He is pointing<br>
to a population of people who have been mistreated by the church and <br>
by society as a whole, and asking, "How ought we to love these people?"<br>
<p>
To first order, these issues are decoupled.  It is difficult to argue<br>
about both of them at the same time, and what has been happening is<br>
that someone like me will say "yes we have to do something for these <br>
people BUT HOMOSEXUALITY IS WRONG AND WE MUST HATE THE SIN".  In other words,<br>
only paying passing attention to Marcus' point whilst reiterating mine again.<br>
Marcus is saying something like "I think it's ok, BUT THESE PEOPLE HAVE <br>
BEEN OPPRESSED FOR YEARS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?"<br>
<p>
Is there room for cooperation in outreach to the homosexual person who <br>
most probably feels alienated from the church?  Can someone who approves<br>
of that behavior and someone who disapproves, like myself, find common<br>
ground?  It's difficult when some say that the first step in outreach to <br>
gay men and lesbians is to lead them to cherish their homosexuality as <br>
a good and integral part of their being.  But if there is common ground<br>
to be found, it is here:  why not teach them general Biblical principles<br>
of building new relationships and healing broken ones.  It takes <br>
a willingness of both sides to put truth on the line, to abandon any<br>
preconceptions about what the Bible may say or ought to say, and commit<br>
to live as Jesus would.  If such a community of people with fully healed<br>
relationships could be constructed, then God's will for homosexuals would<br>
be obvious by which direction the healing took.  Deciding whether or <br>
not homosexuals ought to be "fixed" then becomes God's decision and not <br>
ours.  <br>
<p>
Then we could pursue the parallel and exciting discussion of what <br>
hermeneutics could lead one to conclude that homosexuality is acceptable<br>
in the Bible.  Also to be addressed are the two meta-issues:  What <br>
authority should the teachings of the Bible have in the life of the<br>
Christian, and under what circumstances can emotional reactions lead <br>
people to discard doctrines to which they give mental assent.<br>

I posted a query to alt.atheism earlier this week asking atheists for <br>
questions that they often ask Christians but had never gotten satisfactory<br>
answers to.  I received about 30 responses so far.  I had not intended<br>
to post them to SDAnet, I had intended to use them as discussion fodder<br>
in our local "Twentysomething" group this Friday night.  <br>
<p>
But a day after I post the query, the boss of "20something" decided to <br>
override my program choice and so now I am left with a bunch of atheists<br>
thumping whatever it is atheists thump instead of the Bible, waiting <br>
for answers.  A likely story, huh?!<br>
<p>
So, in due time, once I get them compiled, I will send them out to SDAnet,<br>
especially since Tammy Healy put me on the spot and told all of them <br>
that I was going to do it.  Some of them are questions that Christians<br>
can debate among themselves for hours at a time.<br>

<i>&gt; I'm an Adventist, grew up in an Adventist home, but the belief that</i><br>
<i>&gt; homosexuality _in and of itself_, being the work of Satan to destroy</i><br>
<i>&gt; heterosexuality, is not a part of my belief.  Neither is a person's ethnicity,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or physical disability being God's manifest displeasure on that person or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; person's parents.</i><br>
<p>
Anything, if it is not of God, is of the devil.  There is no gray area in life.<br>
 If you agree that homosexuality is not of God, then it by default is from<br>
Satan.<br>
Also worthy of note is that Satan is a master at mixing truth with error.  That<br>
is why so many people fall for what appears to be non-harmful.<br>
<p>
I believe that the practice of homosexuality is a choice...not the tendency but<br>
the practice.  That is quite different from a physical dissability or your<br>
ethnic race, which you do not chose.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As I've said to others on the net, granted that homosexuality is a sin, we as</i><br>
<i>&gt; professed followers of Christ are a part of this world.  If people are</i><br>
<i>&gt; being killed,</i><br>
<i>&gt; fired, or made homeless because of their homosexuality, and we remain silent,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we commit sin.  To we who know to do good AND DO IT NOT, to us it is sin.</i><br>
<p>
People being killed or fired from, I can't do alot about.  The homeless, yes, we<br>
can do something about that, and should, even to homosexuals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Homosexuality is, in my view, not defendable from Scripture, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;expositors have to take great liberties with God's Word in their attempts</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to defend what God plainly calls sin.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is good, it is your view which you are entitled to.  But you/we are NOT</i><br>
<i>&gt; entitled to make a club out of scripture, to beat over people's head *without*</i><br>
<i>&gt; you/us knowing the full reality of the situation, _That_ is what I'm saying to</i><br>
<i>&gt; SDAnet.</i><br>
<p>
Who is beating whom?<br>
<p>
What does the "reality of any situation" got to do with the truth of the Bible.<br>
 If God calls something perverse and sin, what does that got to do with a<br>
situation?  Situations do not affect God' laws, which stand forever.<br>

<i>&gt; As I've said before, Text - Context = Pretext.  The Son of God came eating and</i><br>
<i>&gt; drinking with publicans and "sinners" too.  God's justice is</i><br>
<i>&gt; everlasting, and it takes</i><br>
<i>&gt; into consideration, the WHOLE picture, which we cannot, or will to not see.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks be to Christ, who endured bashing, "demonization", and death for ALL,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and who is returning in terrible justice against the same.</i><br>
<p>
Was Jesus "bashing" Satan when he was tempted by Satan in the wilderness?  Satan<br>
"quoted" scriptures that were distorted interpretations of truth.  Jesus<br>
responded by correctly quoting and representing what was really meant by Satans<br>
statements.<br>

In other words, the God-ordained matrimony between a man and a woman is<br>
"spiritualized" into just a "covenant" into which homosexuals may also<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; I'm an Adventist, grew up in an Adventist home, but the belief that </i><br>
<i>&gt; homosexuality _in and of itself_, being the work of Satan to destroy</i><br>
<i>&gt; heterosexuality, is not a part of my belief.</i><br>
<p>
As I took pains to point out in my original post, I do not believe that<br>
homosexuality _in and of itself_ is any greater or lesser of a sin than any<br>
other sexually-immoral behavior.  Such immorality, whether hetero or homo,  is<br>
serving Satan's purposes in eroding God's plan for strong family units<br>
centered around the faithful, committed marriage of a man to a woman.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Neither is a person's ethnicity, or physical disability</i><br>
<i>&gt; being God's manifest displeasure on that person or the person's parents. </i><br>
<p>
A person's ethnicity or physical disability does not constitute willful<br>
and deliberate sinning against God's revealed Word.  Homosexual behavior<br>
does.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nor is the view that the earth is the center of the Universe, a part of</i><br>
<i>&gt; what I believe.</i><br>
<p>
The earth ***is*** the center of the Universe, figuratively speaking, in<br>
terms of where the great controversy is being played out.  And yes, the<br>
great controversy still pits the sophistries of Satan, of which I<br>
believe homosexuality is a part, and the truth and justice of Jesus Christ.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So neither you nor I can speak for ALL Adventists.</i><br>
<p>
Nor do I wish to.  I express my view of Scripture as I see it just as<br>
freely as you or any other person can.  I am using my KJV to batter no<br>
one.  The rights that you demand you must in turn grant to others on the<br>
net.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I interpret your phrase "taking great liberties" to mean that I take</i><br>
<i>&gt; liberty the invitation to prayerfully "dig in" in search</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the "hidden pearls" in scripture (in context), free from pre-imposed </i><br>
<i>&gt; prejudiced opinion.</i><br>
<p>
No, you interpret it incorrectly.  What I meant by taking great liberties<br>
is to regard plain facts of Scripture as "pre-imposed prejudiced opinion"<br>
because they don't square with what ***you*** believe.<br>
<p>
And finally, Marcuss, you seem to feel that my previous post was a direct<br>
response to you when it was not.  I had no particular person or post in<br>
mind when I wrote it; neither did I even have your name in mind at all at<br>
any point as I composed it.  However, apparently it had an impact....<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; Some posters talked about seperating the sin from the sinner.  That is</i><br>
<i>&gt; really wishy washy, and I don't think God looks at it that way.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; person who steals is a thief.  A person who kills is a murderer.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; person who does not speak the truth is a liar.  A person who has sex</i><br>
<i>&gt; with members of his own sex is a homosexual.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but Christ separated the two.  He mingled with and interacted with the<br>
sinners, the prostitutes.  While helping and loving them as people, He did not<br>
condone their actions.  To the woman about to be stoned, He told her to go and<br>
sin no more.<br>
<p>
My point in suggesting that the sin be separated from the sinner is in our<br>
dealing with them.  We accept homosexuals as humans deserving of respect but we<br>
don't condone their lifestyle.  We help them thru the problem, but only if they<br>
see it is wrong and want our help.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When Christ comes in judgment, these people will be destroyed.  God is</i><br>
<i>&gt; holding these objects of his wrath until then.  (Read Romans 9)  When a</i><br>
<i>&gt; thief is put in jail, the PERSON is put in jail, not his actions.</i><br>
<p>
True.  But my comments were only meant to help us know how to deal with the<br>
person.  I am willing to help someone as long as they understand that by my<br>
actions, I am helping them as a person and not condoning the choices they have<br>
made.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As a Church, we must learn to accept the homosexual, and his behaviour,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but without approving of it.  Then when they are led to Christ, over</i><br>
<i>&gt; time, as they renew and transform their minds, they will change.  And it</i><br>
<i>&gt; does take time, and they will sometimes fall.  But that is what the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Church is for, to bring them back.</i><br>
<p>
A very well stated point.  I agree.<br>

I received your post.  for the moment I will just be lurking, as it were. <br>
I have very serious problems with the church at the moment but I want to<br>
see just what level of discussion I can expect here before I jump in.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, my background includes 4 yrs of Theology at an Adventist<br>
institution, 3 yrs service in the Adventist ministry, and 2 yrs at Andrews<br>
Univ for my Master's degree.<br>
<p>
I have been an Adventist all my life.<br>

It *seems* we might be near a red herring.<br>
<p>
&lt;Calmly asking rhetorical question&gt;<br>
<p>
Nowhere in this "discussion" have I supported anything *near* doing away with<br>
heterosexuality, original marriage, or family.  I _have_ supported the <br>
need to know<br>
and tell the whole story about homosexual humans who are born from the<br>
married man and woman, who are part of a sibling group.  This includes knowing<br>
and telling the whole story (context) as it is found in scripture.  In <br>
this, I have not<br>
proposed that "whatever... anything goes..."  I wonder if the belief <br>
that heterosexuals<br>
can "turn into" homosexuals what many with the traditional view believe?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;As I took pains to point out in my original post, I do not believe that</i><br>

<p>
I'm sorry for overlooking the special detail you placed in being clear in your<br>
last post.  I'll try to be more careful.  Nevertheless, I say again, <br>
this is your opinion.<br>
I respect your opinion. Other people might and do have other opinions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A person's ethnicity or physical disability does not constitute willful</i><br>
<i>&gt;and deliberate sinning against God's revealed Word.  Homosexual behavior</i><br>
<i>&gt;does.</i><br>
<p>
Please read The Desire of Ages, "The Light of Life" chapter.  This issue is<br>
beautifully uncovered.  Being of African American descent, I can attest <br>
that many<br>
"Christian" people argued against ending the institution of slavery <br>
because it was<br>
interpreted that our skin color and culture is a result of a curse God <br>
placed on Canaan,<br>
the son of Ham, for Ham's act of looking upon the body of a naked and <br>
drunk Noah.<br>
(Gen 9: 18-27)  It was Ham's deed or "sin" which supposedly brought the curse,<br>
later interpreted to support the enslavement of Africans.  There were other<br>
Christians who believed otherwise, but many payed with their lives and <br>
the lives of<br>
their families.  Most noteworthy are the Quakers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The earth ***is*** the center of the Universe, figuratively speaking, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;terms of where the great controversy is being played out.  And yes, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;great controversy still pits the sophistries of Satan, of which I</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe homosexuality is a part, and the truth and justice of Jesus Christ.</i><br>
<p>
The first half of this point I agree with you, the second half I do <br>
not.  But we both<br>
have a right to our opinions... the issue is not our opinions, but the <br>
ways in which<br>
they are acted out, and the effect they have on people.<br>
<p>
In your previous post you said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Adventists believe that Satan has been actively seeking to obliterate the</i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning and importance of the Sabbath institution.  We also believe he has</i><br>
<i>&gt;been seeking to do the same to the heaven-ordained union between husband</i><br>
<i>&gt;and wife."</i><br>
<p>
Saying "Most Adventist believe... or the Majority believe" makes more room<br>
for reality.  An English or communications professor would assume "Adventists<br>
believe" is a non-verbal way of saying "all Adventists".  (Me, of all <br>
people talking<br>
about English - SC's Jan Haluska would be speechless) Interesting <br>
enough, I'm in<br>
the majority (rare occasion) about Satan's battle against the Sabbath and<br>
heterosexual marriage.  Yet I part ways when we try to include <br>
homosexuality: "the<br>
state of being physically, mental, emotional, and spiritual attraction <br>
to a person of<br>
the same gender" as a tool in breaking these institutions down, at <br>
least heterosexual<br>
marriage.  Satan has also battled to keep the spirit of fear and <br>
prejudice alive and<br>
well so that homosexuals have been turned away from the Gate which is Christ.<br>
Yet a growing number of them are as persistent as the Samaritan woman who<br>
contended with Christ granting that the bread of life was only to the <br>
children, even the<br>
"dogs" get to eat the crumbs from the children's table.<br>
<p>
I'm sorry if it seems that I'm not allowing you to express your view of <br>
Scripture<br>
as you see it.  Again I say, when the dust of recited scripture settles <br>
no mater<br>
who is reciting it, we all must return and deal practically in a real <br>
life, real human,<br>
and real God way.  My words have not changed, they are as from the beginning.<br>
And if you read my previous posts, you'll see where I discuss the issue,<br>
"granting" that _opinions_ of which I don't subscribe are indeed _fact_.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No, you interpret it incorrectly.  What I meant by taking great liberties</i><br>
<i>&gt;is to regard plain facts of Scripture as "pre-imposed prejudiced opinion"</i><br>
<i>&gt;because they don't square with what ***you*** believe.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, then we disagree.  The "plain facts" I've alluded to are not "plain<br>
facts" to you and the feeling is mutual.  You are only experiencing what<br>
thousands of others have experienced for centuries.  At least I have<br>
experienced it for a few years.<br>

<i>&gt;And finally, Marcuss, you seem to feel that my previous post was a direct</i><br>
<i>&gt;response to you when it was not.  I had no particular person or post in</i><br>
<i>&gt;mind when I wrote it; neither did I even have your name in mind at all at</i><br>
<i>&gt;any point as I composed it.  However, apparently it had an impact....</i><br>
<p>
As a member of SDAnet, you were speaking to Marcus Stringer albeit,<br>
indirectly.  In context, within the last few weeks, there have been precious<br>
few who have posted *as I have*, from a non-traditional perspective.<br>
So you were speaking _to_ me as well, unless you were trying to speak<br>
_around_ me.<br>

<i>&gt;I'm confused.  Where have we gone, but in seeking practical application of</i><br>
<i>&gt;scripture - in context - and applying the principles to our lives as </i><br>
<i>&gt;exemplified</i><br>
<i>&gt;by Jesus in His life and teachings?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Marcus</i><br>
<p>
In seeking goal for personal behavior, it must be remembered that Jesus<br>
did not commit the sins of the various people who followed him.  So<br>
though Jesus associated with prostitutes, tax collectors, and Pharisees,<br>
he did not practice prostitution, nor cheat people on taxes, nor was<br>
he a hypocrite.  Would Jesus associate with homosexuals today?  Certainly.<br>
This does not mean that He would condone such behavior.<br>
<p>
All the various texts in the Bible that can be used against homosexuality<br>
have already been posted once or twice by now.  Marcus and others have<br>
claimed they have explained them all away.  Bible thumping or squirming<br>
away from Bible thumping is going to get us nowhere now.  SDAnet is not <br>
for rehashing of the same arguments that appear everywhere else.  Unless<br>
people on both sides admit the prejudices they come to the Bible with,<br>
it's pointless to discuss the Bible and homosexuality further.<br>
<p>
I must admit that Marcus' method of applying scripture escapes me entirely,<br>
and a few words on his method would be very enlightening.<br>

Now time for soul-searching of those, who believe, as do I, that the <br>
various texts in the Bible provide clear evidence against homosexuality.<br>
<p>
Is it possible to consistently hold such a view and yet hold that <br>
other texts in very close chapters and of the same nature can be construed<br>
to allow the ordination and equality of women in the church?<br>

Note that I put moralists in quotes.  And later mentioned reference to Christ.<br>
It was a suggest that such acts of morality are not "moral" at all, considering<br>
the whole picture.  When I take things out of context and use them as fact,<br>
ignoring other principles involved, then I'm worthy of quotes too and should<br>
be identified as a "moralist".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I take it you are excluding yourself from the "moralists"?  If a moralist is</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone who has morals, then I guess I am a moralist.  But yet I don't </i><br>
"go into<br>
<i>&gt;the night" and point fingers.</i><br>
<p>
I too am a moralist, especially the Personage and principles which found true<br>
morality (see my above comment).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are you suggesting that Christ and the principles of His character are </i><br>
no where<br>
<i>&gt;to be found?  Have you read the Gospels lately?  Maybe I misunderstood your</i><br>
<i>&gt;statement.</i><br>
<p>
No, and I share your joy that the Gospels help us see and know Christ <br>
better and<br>
thus we know the Father better.  I might have been confusing in my <br>
wording - sorry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What human rights are homosexuals being denied?  You seem to like to tell us</i><br>
<i>&gt;about how mistreated they are, but the ones that I have seen around here, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't seem to be in too bad a shape.  I am not suggesting that some </i><br>
are not, but<br>
<i>&gt;what percentage are we talking about here?  How far should we go in </i><br>
fighting for<br>
<i>&gt;their rights over someone else's rights.  Many people have their rights</i><br>
<i>&gt;violated.  That doesn't make it right.  But why single out the homosexuals?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Lets be fighting against all violated human rights.  I get the feeling from</i><br>
<i>&gt;many of them interviewed on TV that they think they deserve a special </i><br>
status in<br>
<i>&gt;society.</i><br>
<p>
As I've done on other issues before now, I've supported speaking out for the<br>
rights as individuals, and the need for the "Church" to do the same.  <br>
Therefore, I have<br>
not "singled out" homosexuals.  Let there be a discussion about women, ethnic<br>
or racial minorities, the poor, the homeless, broken family relations, <br>
and I'll speak<br>
out, as we all should.<br>
<p>
For the informing of anyone uninformed:<br>
=================================<br>
(1) In the State of Oregon, including all political subdivisions and<br>
government units, minority status shall not apply to homosexuality;<br>
therefore, affirmative action, quaotas, special class or special<br>
classification such as "sexual orientation," "domestic partnerships" or<br>
similar designations shall not be established on the basis of homosexuality.<br>
<p>
(2) Children, students and employees shall not be advised, instructed or<br>
taught by any government agency, department or political unit in the<br>
State of Oregon that homosexuality is the legal or social equivalent of<br>
race, color, religion, gender, age or national origin; nor shall public<br>
funds be expended in a manner that has the purpose or effect of promoting<br>
or expressing approval of homosexuality.<br>
&lt;More deleted&gt;<br>
=============================<br>
Society does treat some people special (positively speaking).  If some people<br>
have their way, as this case shows, it definitely wont be the homosexuals.<br>
Not unlike the citizen alliances formed to oppose the civil rights movement of<br>
the 1950's and 60's, many present day citizens alliances have formed to<br>
oppose the *inclusion* of homosexual people into those basic <br>
civil/human rights.<br>
<p>
"Homosexuality is that mark of Cain, of a godless soulless culture which is<br>
sick to the core."<br>
<p>
"The teaching of the youth to appreciate the value ... of the <br>
community, derives its<br>
strongest inner power from the truths of Christianity.... For this <br>
reason it will always<br>
be my special duty to safeguard the right and free development of the Christian<br>
school and the Christian fundamentals of all education."<br>
<p>
The first statement comes from a Fascist pamphlet published in Nazi Germany;<br>
the second was made by Adolf Hitler in a 1933 edict on the education of German<br>
young people.  Historians say that in the name of Christ and moral <br>
purity, Hitler later<br>
had people who were suspected of homosexuality either shot without trial or<br>
exterminated in concentration camp gas chambers.  If you've listened to <br>
testimonies<br>
of Jews who survived the death camps, they will say that the above <br>
statement sounds<br>
frighteningly close to that which proceeded the holocaust half a century ago.<br>
<p>
This is probably what some if not all homosexuals think of when they <br>
experience<br>
scripture, and "moral" crusades out to change their orientation, legal <br>
limitation of their<br>
human rights.  Again, my position is, we might want to read more <br>
carefully the scriptures<br>
we use against others.  The Jews kept silent, and few were around to <br>
speak up for them<br>
when it was their turn.<br>

Len,<br>
	You only have to look to China (remember Beijing?), Russia, <br>
Hitlers Germany, the 1200's etc to realize that an unarmed citizenry<br>
has no freedom or control over it's destiny.  It is at the mercy of the<br>
government.  The right to bear arms was specificaly included to prevent<br>
that kind of abuse.  The armed free man is and always has been the only<br>
guarantee of freedom, and the only thing standing in the way of tyranny.<br>
Unfortuanatly, our *dear* U.S. government has worked hard to disarm it's<br>
citizens, basically by guaranteeing that it can out gun them.  Personal<br>
opinion is that all people should be REQUIRED to own a gun, and preferably<br>
a machine gun.  That has been the practice in of the Swiss for many years.<br>
All military aged males have to maintain a gun, and I believe that they<br>
are fully automtic.  Violent crime is almost unknown there.  Soft crimes<br>
however, are rampant (pornography &amp; drugs (which are legal, easily available<br>
and the needles are free, while resulting in a major drug addiction problem,<br>
at least there it trims the drug related crime rate WAY down.)<br>

Hello people, <br>
	my email account here will close down in 2 days time, but Steve is<br>
sending SDAnet to me on a fidonet BBS (thanks Steve, i am getting it loud<br>
and clear). Only thing is that i don't know how to address mail to internet<br>
and hence SDAnet from a fidonet BBS. If anyone out there is on fidonet and<br>
knows how to do this, could you please let me know. The PC based BBS is<br>
running Remote Access software.<br>
	Thanks in advance,<br>
<p>

I have received many questions in response to my questionnaire about<br>
questions that Christians have never answered correctly.  <br>
I enclose them here, for you all to chew on over the weekend.  <br>
I will hold up the regular SDAnet over the weekend to allow a <br>
"cooling off" period as it were.  Anyone who sent me a post since<br>
1 AM this morning won't see it until Monday.<br>
<p>
Rather than trying to answer all the questions broadside, try to pick<br>
out two or three and give thoughtful answers.  We need questions like this<br>
to keep us honest.  Time was when SDAnet had resident atheists of our own.<br>
No longer.  (at least none that admit it).<br>
<p>
(And please don't include this whole post when replying.  SCT)<br>
<p>
Questions begin here<br>

*From: Hein Ragas &lt;heinr@sci.kun.nl&gt;<br>
<p>
Hello. I am a net.atheist, for your information. (Actually, a<br>
net.free.thinker!)<br>
There are several questions that I frequently ask Christians, and they fail<br>
to give me an answer that satisfies me.<br>
I hope you could answer them for me.<br>
<p>
1) _Why_ do you believe in god?<br>
2) If god is so just, good, and loving, and if god wants to save us so bad, why<br>
   doesn't he show himself to all the people in the world at once? That's <br>
   the sure way to get everybody converted.<br>
3) Some christians say: 'The only way you can get saved, is to accept the lord<br>
   jesus as your saviour.' Ergo, actions do not count. Is a god, that allows<br>
   people to kill eachother off, but still allows them in heaven, not a<br>
   bastard? Don't you feel you are worshipping a bastard?<br>
<p>

*Why* did Jesus have to die for our sins?  <br>
Why can't goD just forgive us when we repent? <br>
<p>
<p>
*From: apodaca@ucsu.Colorado.EDU<br>
<p>
If a Christian believes that the Bible is the absolute word of god,<br>
how can s/he pick and choose passages to believe and follow and<br>
passages to ignore without being hypocritical?<br>
<p>
i.e. how can a Christian use the Leviticus passage which forbids male<br>
homosexuality to justify discrimination against homosexuals, and<br>
at the same time, ignore the Leviticus passages which deal with<br>
personal hygene and clothing?<br>
<p>
<p>
*From: (James J. Lippard) &lt;LIPPARD@CCIT.ARIZONA.EDU&gt;<br>
<p>
What is the purpose of the crucifixion?  That is, how is it that God's<br>
sacrificing himself incarnate pays for the sins of humanity?  To whom<br>
is this sacrifice "owed"?  Why can't God just say "OK, you're all forgiven"<br>
without the sacrifice?<br>
<p>
If salvation is by faith and not by works, why does everything Jesus says<br>
about salvation in the synoptic gospels seem to indicate otherwise?<br>
<p>
What is one clear, specific, detailed prophecy of the Messiah in the<br>
Hebrew scriptures which was clearly fulfilled by the historical Jesus,<br>
and in such a way that the fulfillment was itself remarkable?  (i.e.,<br>
could not have been intentionally been fulfilled by a prospective Messiah<br>
claimant)<br>
<p>
What happens to those who don't hear about Christianity during their lifetime?<br>
If they go to hell, that seems unfair.  If they don't go to hell, then<br>
missionaries are sending people to hell by telling them about Christianity<br>
and giving them a chance to reject it.<br>
<p>
Why didn't God just create heaven, with all of the people who he knew in<br>
advance would go there in it, instead of creating the earth and sending<br>
many people to hell?<br>
<p>
<p>
I am a "recovering Catholic;"  that is to say, I have almost purged all of the<br>
detrimental teachings of that particular sect from my brain.  I spent a year<br>
in the seminary, on my way to becoming a priest (or so I thought).  I give you<br>
this background to let you know that my search for God (long since abandoned)<br>
is no fly by night, passing concern.  <br>
<p>
Here's the question that no Christian can answer.  How do you know God's will?<br>
 Let's assume you need to make a very important decision, and in Christian<br>
fervor pray over the matter in order to discover God's will.  You pray, and<br>
some sign or another (which you of course interpret as a sign, using your<br>
mind) comes to you.  You then decide what to do.  Note those words *YOU*<br>
*Decide* what to do.  <br>
<p>
If one wants to pass off the responsibility for making a decision to what one<br>
perceives as God and his will, that is your right.  However, ultimately<br>
knowing what to do is up to the thinking individual, even *if* you deign to<br>
call the decision God's will.<br>
<p>
P.S.  I knew a guy who, after making numerous mistakes at work and generally<br>
being a slougher, was passed over for a promotion.  "Oh well," he said with a<br>
clear conscience, "that must be God's will for me."  What a disgusting way to<br>
avoid responsibility.<br>

OK, what is God and how do you come to know this??<br>
<p>
<p>
*From: solovay@netcom.com (Andrew Solovay)<br>
<p>
My A1 question:<br>
<p>
How can anyone, in a finite lifetime, commit crimes/sins which merit<br>
*infinite* punishment? I could (in principle) understand if, say, all<br>
my "sins" worked out to 1E15 years of torture, or something like that;<br>
but sooner or later it'd all be paid off, right?<br>
<p>
 <br>
Andrew Solovay<br>
<p>
<p>
1) If god is infinite (or everywhere), I must be part of god. And, if god<br>
is perfect and infinite, I am part of a perfect being. Ergo, I am <br>
perfect. How can I be a sinner?<br>
<p>
2) If god is able to do whatever he wants, why did he need to kill his<br>
own son and not just forgive us all?<br>
<p>
3) If god know it all, where is the freedom of choice when things are<br>
already established?<br>
<p>
4) If god can do anything he wants, why did he create men?<br>
<p>
5) Anyway, why did god create men?<br>
<p>
6) Why did god create all the other planers, galaxies, etc?<br>
<p>
7) Why didn't god stop the Nazis and saved all the people who died in the<br>
Holocaust?<br>

Well, how about the tired old thread "Messianic Jews and Christians",<br>
which deals with Christian accountability to the Old Testament, in terms<br>
of Matthew 5:17-20.  It seems like any time anyone points out the flaws in<br>
the OT, some Christian will proclaim that the OT doesn't apply in the "New<br>
Convenant".  Yet Matthew 5:17-20 is quite clear.  Explain.  <br>

1.)  Why should one believe in gods?  (Request for evidence incl.)<br>
2.)  Why does your "God" wish to be worshipped?<br>
3.)  What has he/she/it done to deserve my respect?<br>
4.)  What is his/her/its motivation?<br>
5.)  If you believe in a god who knows the future, how do<br>
     you explain away the contradictions that naturally arise?<br>
6.)  Explain the concept of Trinity without resorting to the use of<br>
     the word "mystery" or its synonyms.<br>
7.)  Explain the idea of "redemption" and tell just why was it <br>
     even necessary.  <br>
8.)  What is "sin"?<br>
9.)  [Various biblical trivia]<br>
10.)  What does the phrase "God is love" mean?<br>
<p>
The above were ones that popped immediately into my mind.  <br>
Hope it helped.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
 <br>
Here is one:<br>
 <br>
The fundamental difference between many atheists and theists is not so<br>
much what we believe but what we accept as reliable ways of knowing.<br>
It does not seem to be possible to prove the existence of a god or gods<br>
on the basis of empirical evidence or logical argument, or at least all<br>
such attempts to date are widely judged by both philosophers and<br>
theologians to have failed.  Faith (belief in the absence of empirical<br>
evidence or logical proof) is held by most to be the proper basis for<br>
religious belief, but it is not felt to be a reliable way of knowing in<br>
any other areas of inquiry.  For example, in a court of law, we don't<br>
believe one man's complaint just because we have faith in him; proof is<br>
required to win a case.  If faith is not reliable in some areas of<br>
inquiry, why should we accept it as reliable in another: the question<br>
of the existence of supernatural beings?  Isn't it rather that the sole<br>
basis of religious belief is the desire to believe, or rather make<br>
believe?<br>
 <br>

<p>
*From: nrp@st-andrews.ac.uk (Norman R. Paterson)<br>
<p>
Q1.  Define what you mean by "God".<br>
(I generally find everyone has a different definition, even within a given<br>
religion.  This makes it difficult to discuss god.  I find that the only time<br>
people agree what "god" is, they are agreeing to a definition so vague as to<br>
be worthless.)<br>
<p>
Q2.  Resolve the paradox of omniscience and free will.<br>
(The only solutions I have seen to this are fudged.)<br>
<p>
Q3.  How do you explain the fact that if you had been born in, say, India,<br>
	you would have been as committed to Hinduism<br>
	as you are now committed to Christianity.<br>
(Substitute region &amp; religion of choice.  You can always find incompatible<br>
religions, so it's not good enough to say that "all religions are<br>
essentially the same.")<br>
<p>
Q4.  If your god told you to buy a rifle and shoot children, would you do it?<br>
(Don't say it doesn't happen.  It did in the Old Testament, and it<br>
happens nowadays.<br>
Or don't you think that David Koresh really believed what he said?  A<br>
straight yes or no<br>
is required.)<br>
<p>
Q5.  How do you tell if someone is a "True Christian?"<br>
(Is there ANY way of telling?  If not, how do you know whether David<br>
Koresh was one<br>
or not?  Be specific.  Apply the test to Joan of Arc, Mother Teresa,<br>
Adolf Hitler (he<br>
thought he was - see the FAQ), the Bishop of Durham (UK), Mormons,<br>
Muslims etc.)<br>
<p>
Let's see how these do for starters.<br>
<p>
-Norman<br>
<p>
Ohh, what the heck.  Here's one:<br>
<p>
Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it<br>
because it is good?  (ie., can God really be the ultimate source of<br>
morality?)<br>

How important is the idea that Jesus will return?<br>
If many people get the idea that it is close at hand,<br>
some those people might make the world a nastier<br>
place to be, as in the case of the cult in Texas.<br>
At the present, there does not seem to be any sign<br>
that the major Christian sects think that any<br>
return of Jesus will occur any time soon.  If any<br>
sects do consider that the return of Jesus is<br>
important, when and how do they envision it<br>
happening?<br>
<p>
*From: Jeffrey Clark &lt;J.Clark@edn.gu.edu.au&gt;<br>
<p>
Steve here's a couple:<br>
<p>
How come, if you don't know the mind of God, can you be so sure that some of<br>
these self-professed Christians, who carry out atrocities in the name of<br>
God, are not carrying out God's will as God means *them* too?<br>
<p>
Why is the genealogy of Jesus traced back to David via Joseph, when Jesus is<br>
supposed to be immaculately conceived?<br>
<p>
Why does the Bible ("God's Word") get so many basic facts wrong, like bats<br>
are birds, rabbits are cud-chewers, whales are big fish etc?<br>
<p>
What makes your denomination right and all the others wrong, and why<br>
christianity and not Islam or Shintoism or Hinduism etc?<br>
<p>
Why is the Bible written only to males? (Mostly I get denials, but it's<br>
patently obvious if you read it)<br>
<p>
If some parts of the Bible are fallacious or allegorical (I normally get<br>
them to admit this bit), then which bits do you take as guidelines for life<br>
and how do you know they are not fallacious?<br>
<p>
What parts of the observable world would not be explainable without an<br>
existant God? (I normally use this to dazzle Christians with what we do know<br>
as human beings about how the world works, I've even met some that didn't<br>
understand the water cycle)<br>
<p>
How come different denominations seem to be geographically poradic (ie why<br>
is it only the people around you who have access to the TRUTH)?<br>
<p>
This will do for now, but really there are hundreds more. For basically the<br>
incontinuity of the world-view held by most Christians is so blatently<br>
obvious that I find it easy to ask questions that touches on something they<br>
have not thought about. The questions can change for each denomination,<br>
mainly because denominations normally spring from some disagreement about<br>
some particular fallacious aspect of the previous church and therefore the<br>
concentration on certain issues for each church has allowed them to fix up<br>
some of the errors in that fallacy whilst just accepting blindly other<br>
fallacies they don't consider to be particularly important. Basically it's<br>
like trying to tape up a leaky bucket which is still being filled with<br>
knowledge (care of scientific enquiry) and is still decaying due to age. But<br>
some people just can't throw away the old bucket and get a new one!<br>

Wow!! I leave the computer for a few days and SDAnet explodes with an<br>
argument about homosexuality. The usual viewpoints have come to the surface.<br>
<p>
1. Homosexuality is wrong. it has to be punished.<br>
<p>
2. We need to give support to homosexuals reaffirming our love for them<br>
   because they deserve it since Christ died for them as well.<br>
<p>
3. We somehow must accomodate homosexuals because they cannot do <br>
   anything about it.<br>
<p>
I won't go over the arguments as we know what the texts are. We have<br>
quoted the few texts ad nausium dragging our own meanings out of them. I simply<br>
want to say this. For too long we have concentrated on the disciplinary<br>
side of people behaviour, rather than the redemptive side.<br>
<p>
I knew a minister here in Australia who although married, fought homosexual<br>
tendencies and urges all his life. He was caught and disciplined. He came<br>
back to church and made a continued effort through the remainder of his<br>
life to bring people into the church. At the time of his dismissal from<br>
the ministry the argument raged through the church. There were those<br>
who wanted him to stop attending church. Fortunately good sense prevailed<br>
and a caring Christian was able to continue to serve his church in a lay<br>
capacity.<br>
<p>
I taught with a young male teacher who was a homosexual. He too was caught<br>
and disciplined. He was dismissed from the teaching work force, his parents<br>
rejected him and a couple of year later, he died of AIDS. I did not know<br>
him well. His dimissal took place only a couple of weeks after my arrival<br>
at the school. I did not know till a couple of year later that he was<br>
homosexual. I met him from time to time in my professional capacity and<br>
I am sorry that I did not do more to affirm him as a Christian. His<br>
death from AIDS did not surprise me. By that time I was teaching in<br>
a different part of the country. I can only hope that those who ministered<br>
to him in his final illness were loving caring Christians.<br>
<p>
My heart goes out to those people who are disciplined by the church.<br>
Sometimes, I think we cure warts by chopping off arms and legs. We <br>
need to develop techniques for affirming the worth of people no<br>
matter what they have done.<br>
<p>
Christ affirmed prostitutes, adulterers, cheats, murderers, and thieves<br>
during his ministry, not in their sin, but because he sensed in each a<br>
person of value, someone worth dying for. His response was "Come unto Me."<br>
His greatest indictments are against those who are hypocrites, those who <br>
lead others astray, and those who have knowledge but do not pass it on.<br>
<p>
I ma heterosexual and love it, but I know that in my heart is pride,<br>
jealousy, hypocracy and so on. With sins like that on my slate, I want to<br>
do something to ease the path of other Christians no matter what their<br>
sins are.<br>
<p>
When we have learned to love those we love the least, then we will<br>
have developed a true Christian love.<br>

(And the result is many kilojoules of heat but no light)<br>
<p>
The discussion on homosexuality has been interesting but I think there<br>
has been precious little actual communication that actually went on.<br>
We may never reach consensus before the Second Coming, but I think <br>
it ought to be possible to at least understand why communication has been<br>
difficult on this issue, and at least be able to address the concerns <br>
of both sides.  Note that it is much easier to react than to communicate.<br>
<p>
Issue 1:  What is opinion and what is the word of the LORD and what <br>
is experimental fact?<br>
Marcus suggests that the core of the scriptural argument against<br>
homosexuality is some people's opinion of the texts which can also be <br>
read a different way.  I have suggested that his interpretation of<br>
when homosexuality starts and its intrinsic moral value is opinion and <br>
not established fact.  The two starting sets of hypotheses are completely<br>
differently, yet both sides of the argument (and here I include myself)<br>
have proceeded in the argument as if our hypotheses ought to be taken<br>
for granted by the opposite side, and proceeded to make arguments<br>
based on them.  If the audience does not accept the underlying hypotheses,<br>
why should we expect anyone to listen to the arguments?<br>
<p>
Issue 2:  Irrespective of whether homosexuality is or is not a sin,<br>
how ought the church to respond to those who claim this orientation?<br>
<p>
Those who have a burden for this community generally say that this issue<br>
ought to be addressed first.  Some netters point out, though, that <br>
Jesus said "Go, and sin no more."  Thus the moral implications are dragged<br>
into the discussion, and the two issues are mangled together.  It's not<br>
helped by those who say that the first step is affirming these people<br>
in their homosexuality.  Since there are also politically correct people<br>
that say that is wrong to give deaf people operations to help them hear<br>
"you are destroying a valid community with its own active culture and <br>
methods of communication", I am not surprised.  But I think in the short<br>
run if any consensus is to be reached, issue 1 and 2 must be decoupled.<br>
<p>
Perhaps one of the few things we can agree on is that the current church<br>
record in this area is dismal.  Colin Cook cost us a great deal of <br>
credibility.  I don't suppose the trademark suit endeared the church <br>
leadership to the Kinship gay "SDA" organization, either.  Yet it <br>
is not an overstatement to say that the scriptural interpretation used<br>
by this group is difficult for some Adventists to recognize as an Adventist<br>
interpretation of any sort.  <br>
<p>
Issue 3:  Relationship theology:<br>
Can the covenant relationship, image of God, be reproduced in a sexual<br>
relationship between two members of the same sex?<br>
<p>
It is not clear to me that either side thinks this question matters.<br>
Certainly many times God's image is not expressed in heterosexual union.<br>
It's also not clear why monogamy should matter to those whose morals<br>
allow homosexuality.<br>
This issue can be resolved, however, with experimental data.<br>
<p>
Issue 4:  What makes many people, Christian and not, fear homosexuals<br>
and are these fears founded.<br>
<p>
<p>
If we can attack the issues,  there can at least be communication.<br>
We may never agree, but at least we'll know why we don't.<br>

Or, the grass is always greener over the septic tank<br>
<p>
I don't remember the percentage of people that leave the SDA church over<br>
some conflict with some person, but it is large.  I suspect that even <br>
this figure is underreported, because some of the people who have left<br>
over doctrinal disagreements have come to these disagreements during<br>
conflict with people or organization of the church, which may have had<br>
nothing to do with the doctrine.<br>
<p>
I call to mind the experience of my SDA/ANC/agnostic/catholic/lesbian<br>
friend mentioned here previously.  Her discontent with the church began<br>
not with any doctrine, but with a reactionary pastor who wanted to keep <br>
blacks and women in their place in South Africa.  She first said that<br>
she assented mentally to the doctrines of the SDA church (else she wouldn't<br>
have been baptized at age 12 or whatever) but within 2 weeks of that time<br>
she said that she was doubting the existence of God altogether.<br>
<p>
She has now convinced herself that the Catholic church is much more friendly<br>
to the women's cause and the gay rights cause both.  (I think it's probably<br>
about a tie between Catholic and SDA in both of these categories).  This<br>
is what I mean by "grass is greener over the septic tank."  SDAnet<br>
subscribers who have been around for awhile saw one of our readers switch<br>
from Mormon-basher to Mormon, due mainly to cognitive dissonance.  We were <br>
also treated with a stellar picture about how LDS women have it  so good.<br>
<p>
What does this tell us?  It points out that if the written words of a<br>
doctrine fail to match up to the practice of the doctrine, people notice.<br>
This is a gut-level emotional reaction, which is the opposite of the <br>
initial reaction that comes with conviction of truth.  There can be a <br>
positive side for this, because it is frequently such a reaction that<br>
leads people to search out the SDA church.<br>
<p>
Thoughts?<br>

Since my organ teacher plays at two different churches (Episcopal<br>
and Catholic) I have had the opportunity to observe her on several<br>
occasions, and see a service while I am there.  I always leave these<br>
sessions with interesting ideas (to me at least):<br>
<p>
1)  There's precious little difference between Episcopals and Catholics.<br>
Still enough to make the Catholics call the Episcopals damnable heretics, <br>
(Episcopals break the wafer of bread as they consecrate it) but not much <br>
else.  I believe the word "Protestant" was struck from the title <br>
"Protestant Episcopal" some time ago.  (check me on this?)<br>
<p>
2)  Both find ways to involve young people as integral parts of the service.<br>
With all the crosses, candles, and whatnot to lug around, several acolytes<br>
and crucifers are needed.  In the Episcopal tradition, acolytes can be girls<br>
as well as boys, and a news item indicated that Catholics are thinking <br>
about allowing this, too.  What would an SDA service look like with two<br>
young people serving communion on either side of the pastor?  Couldn't hurt?<br>
Or is it pagan by definition because the Catholics do it?<br>
<p>
3)  You never have a first elder stumbling through an impromptu prayer<br>
because the order of prayer is always predetermined.  <br>
<p>
4)  On the con side, singing the same liturgy every week would get slightly<br>
boring.  But you do have to be on your toes to follow it all at first.<br>
There's no sitting back and sleeping for 40 minutes, participation is <br>
required every step of the way except during the 10-15 minute sermon.<br>
<p>
So how did the SDA form of worship become mostly like the Baptist liturgy?<br>
Baptists weren't prominent in the early SDA church, were they?<br>
Both denominations are so-called "spiritual experience" denominations<br>
which place large emphasis on preaching as opposed to corporate worship<br>
(and expect their ministers to uphold high moral standard).  That's<br>
all I can think.<br>
<p>
Is the SDA church service today more devoted to conveying information<br>
or to worship of God?  Are these mutually exclusive?<br>
<p>

Tim,<br>
I will sign you up for SDAnet and send you  the Koresh stuff<br>
The only way I have to do that is to send you all the SDAnet postings<br>
for the past two months.  It will be a couple MB in all.<br>
<p>
We have several WWC students and faculty on SDAnet.<br>
But it's fairly recently that they joined.<br>

Scott Mattes writes:<br>
<i>&gt;  I am reading The Great Contraversy and wanted to see if my impressions</i><br>
<i>&gt;on what EGW is saying are 'correct'.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  1) There is no eternal punishment for the wicked.  So what happens to</i><br>
<i>&gt;them?</i><br>
<p>
The punishment of the wicked is eternal in effect but not in duration.<br>
The wicked burn up, and die, and that's it.  They cease to exist for<br>
all of eternity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  2) After death there is no consciousness.  Where are our spirits after</i><br>
<i>&gt;we die?</i><br>
You need to understand the definition of spirit used here, quite different<br>
from the LDS definition or the mainstream Protestant definition.  <br>
What happens to the spirit is found in Ecclesiastes 12:7.<br>
Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit<br>
shall return to God who gave it.<br>
In the narrow sense of spirit it refers to the breath of life, the quantity<br>
of being alive.  We do not view the spirit as having a consciousness<br>
separate from the body.  Some writings of EGW refer to the spirit also <br>
as comprising our distinctive traits of character.  Think of it sort of <br>
as God's backup, and at the resurrection he restores our existence <br>
from the backup.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  3) I find it interesting that EGW acknowledges that we will be judged</i><br>
<i>&gt;by our works.</i><br>
Through selective quoting of EGW you can prove any position from legalism<br>
to antinomianism.  Can you give me a page reference so I can check the <br>
specific reference you refer to?  A judgment by works is indeed referred<br>
to in EGW and the Bible but no one would pass that judgement save for <br>
the grace and forgiveness of Christ.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  4) I also noticed a interesting contradition.  On page 491-2 she</i><br>
<i>&gt;quotes Gen 3:4-5 as satan's deception, yet in v 22 of the same chapter</i><br>
<i>&gt;God says exactly what satan said in v 5.  I assume that what she meant</i><br>
<i>&gt;was that the 'will not surely die' was the deception.</i><br>
<p>
That's correct:  the "ye shall not surely die" was the main part of <br>
the deception.  But we should also point out that while knowing good and <br>
evil is a small part of being like God, there are many other parts<br>
to which Adam and Eve did not attain by eating the fruit.  <br>
<p>
As for the easter bunny, he won't be over at my house on Sunday.<br>
I do think mainstream Christianity owes him an apology, however, for trying<br>
to steal his holiday.<br>

Nancy's mention of Pharisees brings to mind a Jewish tradition I once <br>
heard.  It seems that the Pharisees believed that if one Sabbath was<br>
kept perfectly in Israel, the Messiah would come.  Has anyone else <br>
ever run across this tradition?<br>
<p>
More importantly, are 7th-Day Adventists guilty of the same thing at times?<br>
Is the fact that Christ has not yet come used as a guilt generator to spur<br>
church members into activity or giving money?  So often we hear that <br>
it is the fault of we, the members, that Christ hasn't come yet, and so <br>
we ought to support Radio Station X or Global Strategy Y, so the gospel <br>
can be preached and Christ can come.  <br>
<p>
Along the same line, we hear the I.K.I.I.E.G.W.S.* statement "When the <br>
character of Christ is fully reproduced in His people, then He will come <br>
to claim them as his own."  <br>
<p>
*I Know It's In EGW Somewhere<br>
<p>
I believe that statement and I believe that a loving and commandment-keeping<br>
people will be God's final and best witness in the last days.  I believe<br>
we have a long ways to go.   <br>
<p>
What I have trouble with is the idea that we can control God by our actions.<br>
There exist reasons why Christ has chosen not to come.  There exist no <br>
barriers that would stop Him from coming at any second He chose.<br>
Instead of pulling the blame on ourselves for it, or pushing it at others,<br>
we need to view God as the God who is in control and ready to help us<br>
finish the work that needs to be done.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
	When we talk about non-active laymembers we generally do so without<br>
considering the reasons why they are not active. We like to simply put people <br>
and things in easy to manage boxes and just blame the members. However I don't <br>
think the problem can be set aside so easily. I have found that the reason<br>
why many members are inactive is not just they're own fault. Some times the<br>
leadership itself stifles action on part of the laymembers because they are<br>
afraid of loosing personal control. Othertimes the laymembers are reluctant<br>
to participate because they have never been encouraged and trained in how<br>
to work for Jesus. Most of the times however it is because the congregation<br>
has lost the fire and sense of mission due to too much compromise with the<br>
world, they can no longer see what Adventism has to offer the world and so <br>
there is no point in converting "already saved" christians from other <br>
denominations.<br>
<p>
	It is that most terrible of all scourges to afflict the church lately<br>
"the independant ministration" of each and every member which the church needs<br>
today. Maybe instead of looking at each other and blaming the other one<br>
for the problem we should be looking at ourselves and wondering whether we are<br>
the stumbling block in the way of permitting members to get up and do the work<br>
as God leads each and every one of us. God leads individuals personally and He <br>
will guide us too if we permit Him. God's leading is not limitted to the <br>
directions of any single person or organisation but promised to each of us <br>
personally.<br>

	Sometimes is seems that the only acceptable work for Jesus is that <br>
carried out the way I want it to under my direction. This simply is the <br>
way that prohibits God from working. In all my experience no matter how <br>
"active" a church may appear to be, it is only in those places where the <br>
leadership actually listens to God's word when He says that those who would<br>
be first must be the servant of all and not lord it over the lesser ones, and<br>
instead of placing themselves in positions of authority put themselves in <br>
positions of servitude that God's work is leaping forward.<br>

<i>&gt;   2) After death there is no consciousness.  Where are our spirits after</i><br>
<i>&gt; we die?</i><br>
<p>
   "But man dies and is laid away; indeed he breathes his last And where is <br>
   he? As water disappears from the sea, and a river becomes parched and <br>
   dries up, so man lies down and does not rise. Till the heavens are no <br>
   more, they will not awake nor be roused from their sleep."  --  Job <br>
   14:10-12  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "His flesh upon him becomes black, and his life-blood dries up within <br>
   him.  His sons rise to honour, and he sees nothing of it; they sink into <br>
   obscurity, and he knows it not." -- Job 14:20,21 (NEB)<br>
<p>
   "For in death there is no remembrance of You; In the grave [sheol] who <br>
   will give You thanks?"  --  Psa 6:5  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.  (Ps. 13:3)<br>
<p>
   I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.  (Psa 17:15)<br>
<p>
   ""What profit is there in my blood, When I go down to the pit? Will the <br>
   dust praise You? Will it declare Your truth?"  --  Psa 30:9  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "Nevertheless man, though in honor, does not remain; He is like the <br>
   beasts that perish. "--  Psa 49:12  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   They have slept their sleep.  Sleep is perpetual.  (Psa 76:5,6)<br>
<p>
   "Will You work wonders for the dead? Shall the dead arise and praise You? <br>
   Selah  Shall Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Or Your <br>
   faithfulness in the place of destruction?  Shall Your wonders be known in <br>
   the dark? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?"  --  Psa <br>
   88:10-12  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "for her house leads down to death, and her paths to the dead;  none who <br>
   go to her return, nor do they regain the paths of life;"  --  Prov <br>
   2:18,19  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "When a wicked man dies, his expectation will perish, and the hope of the <br>
   unjust perishes."  --  Prov 11:7  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "For the living know that they will die; but the dead know nothing, and <br>
   they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.  Also <br>
   their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; nevermore <br>
   will they have a share in anything done under the sun."  --  Eccl 9:5,6  <br>
   (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no <br>
   work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going."  <br>

<p>
   ""Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul <br>
   of the son is Mine; the soul who sins shall die."  --  Ezek 18:4  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   ""The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the <br>
   father, nor the father bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of <br>
   the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked <br>
   shall be upon himself."  --  Ezek 18:20  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   ""When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits <br>
   iniquity, and dies in it, it is because of the iniquity which he has done <br>
   that he dies.  "Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness <br>
   which he committed, and does what is lawful and right, he preserves <br>
   himself alive."  --  Ezek 18:26,27  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   ""And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul <br>

   ""Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David, <br>
   that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day."  -<br>
   -  Acts 2:29  (NKJ)<br>

   LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand,"  --  Acts 2:34  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "But someone will say, "How are the dead raised up? And with what body do <br>
   they come?  Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies. "  <br>
   --  1 Cor 15:35,36  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption, <br>
   it is raised in incorruption.  It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in <br>
   glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.  It is sown a <br>
   natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and <br>
   there is a spiritual body. "  --  1 Cor 15:42-44  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all <br>
   be changed; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. <br>
   For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, <br>
   and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, <br>
   and this mortal must put on immortality.  So when this corruptible has <br>
   put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall <br>
   be brought to pass the saying that is written: "Death is swallowed up in <br>
   victory."  "O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your <br>
   victory?""  --  1 Cor 15:51-55  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who <br>
   have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope.  For if <br>
   we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with <br>
   Him those who sleep in Jesus.  For this we say to you by the word of the <br>
   Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will <br>
   by no means precede those who are asleep.  For the Lord Himself will <br>
   descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and <br>
   with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.  Then we <br>
   who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the <br>
   clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the <br>
   Lord."  --  1 Th 4:13-17  (NKJ)<br>

A recent book that came out on the topic of race relations in the church <br>
is Righteous Rebel, being a biography of W. W. Fordham.<br>
<p>
His career began at Oakwood College where he was one of the leaders of <br>
the 1932 student strike which demanded a Black president for that<br>
institution.  It chronicles the advances that have been made over the<br>
years in race relations.<br>
<p>
If you are looking for a research work, I would suggest Seeking A Sanctuary<br>
by Bull and Lockhart.  There is an extensive section in this book on <br>
race relations in the SDA church.<br>

Steve, you could add to your comments that in S. Africa and I know of what<br>
instance where a black SDA was beaten etc and it was ordered by a white<br>
SDA who was a city official.<br>
<p>
I can review that situation and get more particulars if you are<br>
interested.<br>

To Linda Carpenter,<br>
<p>
Just a comment Linda, The former African American that was president of<br>
the North American Division is quoted as saying in so many words, "Why<br>
are Adventists upset about Celebration churches, the blacks have been<br>
doing church that way for many years!"<br>
<p>
Just in response to your comment on interracial marriages, I have had<br>
quite a few such couples as I have pastored in SDA churches. The problem<br>
seems to be that some African Americans as well as whites will not accept<br>
them. I knew of such a couple at Benton Harbor, MI. The white SDA church<br>
would not accept them and perhaps might not have been willing to have<br>
their membership in the church, not sure about that, the black church<br>
really did not accept them either but did tolerate them. This was back in<br>
the 70s. The other thing is that their children had a rough time being<br>
accepted by their peers. Do you think this has changed here in the 90s?<br>

To my surprise and amusement, I saw posted on the bulletin board at my church<br>
a letter "to whom it may concern" from W. Richard Lesher, president of <br>
Andrews University.<br>
<p>
Apparently there has been a major outcry against the artwork found in the <br>
student directory of Andrews University, the CAST.  Lesher described this<br>
as artwork containing religious themes, which some people have interpreted<br>
as an endorsement of Catholic theology.<br>
<p>
Lesher in his letter commends the editor for trying to portray a religious <br>
theme at all, and apologizes for the fact that the CAST sponsor was out of <br>
the country when the CAST went to press.  He conveys the students feeling <br>
that no specific theological message was meant by the artwork, that the<br>
editors were simply trying to emphasize that Andrews University is a <br>
religious institution.<br>
<p>
The fact that such a letter appears six months after the CAST comes out<br>
is a little surprising, usually such rumours travel around the globe much <br>
faster.  And again, whilst defending himself, Lesher has exposed the<br>
controversy to a much larger audience.<br>
<p>
The fact that none of our many correspondents at Andrews University has seen <br>
fit to mention this tempest in a salt shaker can give us some idea of the<br>
relative unimportance of this issue to daily life.<br>

<i>&gt; the 70s. The other thing is that their children had a rough time being</i><br>
<i>&gt; accepted by their peers. Do you think this has changed here in the 90s?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt;Paul Gates&gt;&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
Well, pastor, it just so happens that I am originally from that area myself.<br>
I attended Edith B. Garrett SDA church school, which is attached to the white<br>
SDA church you speak of.  I also remember the episode you refer to - I<br>
attended church school and academy with the young White woman involved.<br>
Unfortunately it appears that not much has changed.  It is still very<br>
difficult for an interracially mixed couple to find a place, and they, more<br>
often than not, usually end up in an African American regional church.<br>
 <br>
In considering the race issue in the church both here and in South Africa, I<br>
am reminded of Dr. M.L. King's LETTER FROM BIRMINGHAM JAIL of April 16, 1963<br>
in which he addresses White moderate church members - "Things are different<br>
now. So often the contemporary church is a weak, ineffectual voice with an<br>
uncertain sound.  So often it is an archdefender of the status quo ...  But<br>
the judgment of God is upon the church as never before.  If today's church<br>
does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose<br>
its authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an<br>
irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century ...<br>
   Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic.  Is organized religion too<br>
inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world?<br>
Perhaps I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the church within<br>
the church, as the true 'ekklesia' and the hope of the world.  But again I am<br>
thankful to God that some noble souls from the ranks of organized religion<br>
have broken loose from the paralyzing chains of conformity and joined us as ac<br>
tive partners in the struggle for freedom.  They have left their secure<br>
congregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with us.  They have<br>
gone down the highways of the South on tortuous rides for freedom.  Yes, they<br>
have gone to jail with us.  Some have been dismissed from their churches, have<br>
lost the support of their bishops and fellow ministers.  But they have acted<br>
in the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant.  Their<br>
witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the<br>
gospel in these trouble times.  They have carved a tunnel of hope through the<br>
dark mountain of disappointment."<br>
 <br>
Those last few sentences, in particular, could apply quite readily to those<br>
church members in South Africa.  I admit this exerpt from Dr. King's letter<br>
adequately and eloquently sums up my attitudes about my struggle as an African<br>
American female to realize equality in America and, even more so, in the SDA<br>
church.<br>
 <br>
Just a further word of advice and encouragement, especially to those in South<br>
Africa.  Dr. King in his letter also addresses the concept of time, and a<br>
misconception about time where racial matters are concerned - "Actually, time<br>
itself is neutral, it can be used either destructively or constructively.<br>
More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time more<br>
effectively than have the people of good will.  We will have to repent in this<br>
generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of bad people but for<br>
the APPALLING SILENCE OF THE GOOD PEOPLE.  Human progress never rolls in on<br>
wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men [and<br>
women] willing to be co-workers with God, and without this hard work, time<br>
itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.  We must use time<br>
creatively, in the knowledge that the TIME IS ALWAYS RIPE TO DO RIGHT.  NOW IS<br>
THE TIME TO MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF DEMOCRACY AND TRANSFORM OUR PENDING<br>
NATIONAL ELEGY INTO A CREATIVE PSALM OF BROTHERHOOD.  NOW IS THE TIME TO LIFT<br>
OUR NATIONAL POLICY FROM THE QUICKSAND OF RACIAL INJUSTICE TO THE SOLID ROCK<br>
OF HUMAN DIGNITY."  Emphasis my own.<br>
 <br>

It seems like we've been having a lot of muckraking on SDAnet recently,<br>
and I have done some myself.  I would like to start a new thread on positive<br>
developments, things that have been good news for the church in the past <br>
few years.  I'd like to see people post on why they are happy being <br>
Seventh-day Adventists.  Eventually this will lead to a discussion of <br>
the many ways in which the SDA way is the better way to live.<br>
<p>
Momentous developments in the last few years:<br>
<p>
1)  The opening of the Eastern bloc to the gospel as a whole.<br>
2)  The integration of the S. African church<br>
3)  The opening of Adventist World Radio's big shortwave stations.<br>
4)  Election of R. Folkenberg as GC president<br>
<p>
<p>
You get the idea.  Let's let April be a time for optimism and praise <br>
on SDAnet.  I can think of more, but I want to hear from others.<br>
Some people say "no news is good news, therefore good news is no news"<br>
I'd like to dispel that myth this month.  God is leading in such miraculous<br>
ways it would be a shame not to acknowledge it.<br>
<p>

I heard Elizabeth Elliot on Bible Broadcasting Network discuss<br>
this a few months ago.  She gave an interesting definition of<br>
dying to self.  She said it's a willingness to be inconvenienced<br>
for the Lord.  Sometimes it seems easier to make great sacrifices<br>
for the Lord than to be inconvenienced in little things in His<br>
service.<br>

[Some of the authors in that list are SDA, others are not.  In particular<br>
Henry Morris and Duane T. Gish are not.  If you are looking for interesting<br>
reading I might also recommend the book Science Held Hostage by Van Till,<br>
Young, and Menninga  (science professors at Calvin College).  <br>
I have seen most of the books listed in that list for sale at Baker Book<br>
House in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  They have a mail-order department.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt;   What is the SDA presence in the former USSR?  China?</i><br>
<p>
We have a few retired pastors in our church and a retired dentist who<br>
can afford to travel.  They have made several trips to russia, bringing<br>
back slides and stories of thousands being baptised.<br>
<p>
One problem they ran into on an early trip was running out of Russian<br>
print Bibles.  They scroured the city.  Found a warehouse full owned<br>
by the Baptist church.  They had to pay $4.00 each for several thousand<br>
Bibles that probably cost about $1 or $2 from donated money.  Inside<br>
each Bible, in large print, were the words "Not for sale, a free gift<br>
to the Russian People".<br>
<p>
In English a lot of people have been taught that<br>
  1st Day == Sunday == Lord's day == Sabbath<br>
And a lot of Baptist, Evangelical, etc literature calls upon people<br>
to read their Bibles, keep the Ten Commandments, keep the Sabbath<br>
according to the Bible.  Here people are used to these admonisions<br>
calling them to church on Sunday.  But in Russia there is no word<br>
for Saturday.  Their Saturday is called by a name clearly meaning<br>
Sabbath.  So these people have been reading the new influx of literature<br>
from these churches, some simply verbatim translated by talented<br>
Russians, and are flocking to what ever churches they can find open<br>
on the Sabbath.  Guess what churches they are flocking to?  You guessed<br>
it.  No wonder the thousands who are eager to baptised as<br>
Seventh-Day-Adventists.<br>
<p>
I also understand that the Mormon church is planning to send thousands<br>
of bicycles and young missionaries to Russia quite soon, perhaps even<br>
as we speak.<br>

  This is not an ad, just verifying what the poster heard.<br>
<p>
  Since before the break up we have had recognition in the USSR (I think<br>
it was given about a year before the breakup) and have had missionaries<br>
from neighboring countries going in.  This last month it was announced<br>
that about 3 formal mission areas have had full time leaders called and<br>
that means full time missionaries.  Russia, Georgia and one other<br>
western republic are the ones, I think.<br>

FYI<br>
<p>
Pastor Mark Finley is currently holding evangelistic meetings in Moscow.  In<br>
fact, the auditorium he is using is inside the Kremlin.  The attendance is<br>
about 13,000 for each day.  He is repeating the service three times in order<br>
to accomodate all who wish to attend.<br>
Not long ago a Protestant evangelist offered a free booklet to Russian listenersRequests came in for several million.<br>
Considering the expense of such a response, SDAs paid something like $3000 to a<br>
Moscow newspaper to print Steps to Christ--I believe--in several issues.  Next<br>
step: Pravda offered to print another book free.  This, as you may realize,<br>
happened several months back.<br>
<p>
When China closed about 1950, there were about 30,000 SDAs.  The figure last<br>
year was about 85,000.  When we visited China in 1986 one SDA pastor told about<br>
baptizing more people in one day than his pastor father had baptized in a life=<br>
time.  Almost all evangelism is done by laypersons, since there are very few<br>
pastors--most are quite old.  Some Chinese young people are being permitted<br>
our of the country to study for the ministry.  <br>
<p>
It would seem that in these places not having pastors simply puts the respon-<br>
sibility where it belongs: on the church members.  Maybe we have something to<br>
learn?<br>

I am faced next month with planning another one of our "Prime Time" programs<br>
for our youth here, our topic is "outreach."  Most likely we will come up <br>
with our usual mix of skits, slide shows, and speakers to convey some kind<br>
of message to these young people about why they should and how they can <br>
reach out to their friends.<br>
<p>
But this led me back to thinking about the days when I was that age<br>
(mid to late 1970's).  I remember how my dad would take me and a bunch <br>
of other kids and we would just go through the neighborhood passing out<br>
tracts.  Every fall we used to go Ingathering, for week after week.  <br>
Thing is, we liked doing it.  It was fun.  Nobody had to preach at us that<br>
we had to do it or that it was important, it was just "let's go."<br>
<p>
I have to confess I haven't done much ingathering lately, or passing out<br>
tracts.  And while I know there is much more to sharing your faith than that,<br>
these used to be the easy ways to do it.  Are we just too sophisticated now?<br>
Give me a handful of tracts and the Holy Spirit against the best thought-out<br>
strategy for evangelism there is, and the Holy Spirit will win every time.<br>
<p>
Of course, the Holy Spirit can bless the complicated as well as the simple.<br>
And we would be in a far worse state if we had neither the Holy Spirit nor<br>
a good strategy. <br>
<p>
Nancy Vyhmeister wonders out loud why we observe the greatest success in <br>
areas where there are fewer pastors.  I think it is not fair to say that<br>
pastors handicap the church or draw it back.  Pastors are not so much <br>
a handicap as they are a crutch, giving us the feeling that we are paying <br>
someone else to do the work of sharing.  Those pastors who enable their<br>
congregations to share on their own are the ones who enjoy the most<br>
success.<br>

Steve Timm's posting is challenging to all of us.  What would happen if...<br>
If we took the challenge of Matthew 28:19, 20 and Acts 1:8 seriously???<br>
<p>
On the other hand, a witness needs something to tell.  I think of the<br>
witness of the Samaritan woman--most effective.  And simple.  "Come,"<br>
she said, "see a man that told me everything I've done in life."  She<br>
had not acquired much theological baggage in the encounter with Jesus.<br>
She simply told what had happened to her.  Likewise, the demon-possessed<br>
Gadarenes, whose legion of devils had sent the pigs flying down the cliffs<br>
into the Sea of Galilee.  Jesus sent them to witness without even a set of<br>
Bible studies or the benefit of a series of meetings.  What could they<br>
tell?  I used to be devil possessed.  Now I am free!  Jesus did it!<br>
<p>
Perhaps we have a problem in that we don't have a great story to tell.<br>
If people around me see that because I am a Christian I am more truthful,<br>
more loyal, more caring, I've got the beginning of witness.   Trouble<br>
might be that there is no visible difference....  <br>
<p>
I don't say this because I have "arrived."  No, I am a pilgrim, on the<br>
way, always becoming.  But the pilgrimage is exciting, if not exactly<br>
easy.  <br>
<p>
Yours for more witnesses,<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; time.  Almost all evangelism is done by laypersons, since there are very few</i><br>
<i>&gt; . . . .</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It would seem that in these places not having pastors simply puts the respon-</i><br>
<i>&gt; sibility where it belongs: on the church members.  Maybe we have something to</i><br>
<i>&gt; learn?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Amen!  Amen!<br>
I've seen it happen over here.  Since I've told the story a few times on<br>
SDAnet I'll not go into it again.  Simply that a church I was closely<br>
acquainted with went from the doldrums to rapidly growing when the<br>
laymen got tired of waiting for the pastor to take the lead and took<br>
charge themselves.<br>
<p>
So, absolutely, its the best thing that can happen to a church when<br>
the laymen gecome active.  Now of course, the pastor can assume a vital<br>
role in activating the laymen.  Either way, whether by lay leadership<br>
and/or pastoral leadership, activated laymen make a tremendously big<br>
difference.  Given the choice -- activated laymen vs an active pastor,<br>
I'll go for the church with the involved laymen.  Any day.  And I mean<br>
no reflection on pastors when I say that.<br>
<p>
Thanks Nancy for your story!<br>

Dave likes a church where lay men exercise their gifts.  I do too.  But we<br>
also need to think of the churches where the lay ladies lead out, and do<br>
so quite credibly.  I'm sure Dave did not mean to limit the lay persons<br>
to those of the masculine gender.  However, we some times fail to see how<br>
much lay ladies do for churches.<br>
<p>
By the way, what did you think of the special Review issue on women?<br>

May I say that as Christians, we have the greatest story to tell.<br>
Often, a difficulty is that some feel that if they don't have a<br>
personal experience to express, then they don't have anything<br>
to say.  That is sad.  We can tell about the woman at the well,<br>
about a demon-possessed man named Legion, about Moses and the<br>
prophets; and we can tell about a God named Jesus.<br>
<p>
Take a look at Luke 16:27-31.  Lazarus wanted someone with a<br>
great story to tell (returning from the dead) to go witness to<br>
his five brothers.  Abraham replied, "They have Moses and the<br>
prophets; let them hear them....If they hear not Moses and the<br>
prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the<br>
dead."<br>
<p>
Yours also for more witnesses,<br>

Dave, Believe you are right. If the laymen are active, you are going to<br>
have an active progressive church body. If I am pastoring a church and the<br>
laity are not doing anything and if I cannot challenge them -- I am gone!<br>
Time is too short for it to be wasted on people who will not get the<br>
picture. You may be giving a little distorted pix by indicating the laity<br>
are active and it is the pastor that is sitting on dead center! Sometimes<br>
that is true but not as much as churches where laity think they are doing<br>
the Pastor a big favor by attending church for 2 1/2 hrs on Saturday.<br>

Nancy: I agree with your comments on witnessing. The very best kind of<br>
witnessing is simply telling what God has done for you! However, it is<br>
difficult for a denomination to be a superb witnessing agent when a large<br>
segment of the people do not even know what the gospel is? Nor do they<br>
realize that Justification, Sanctification, Repentance, etc is a gift and<br>
not something to be earned.<br>

Steve, I do not think we are more sophisicated. We have just found more<br>
cost effective ways of doing things. The ministry as well as a lot of<br>
other professions have changed in the last 35 years for example.<br>
<p>
In the last 2 weeks we have given the Spiritual Gifts evaluation in both<br>
of our churches. It has been very revealing not only to the pastor but to<br>
the congregations. Our next step is to help the people to develop their<br>
gifts and apply them to ministry.<br>
<p>
2 others things we are doing is : begin small group meetings weekly in<br>
strategic homes. The other thing is refining a survey that I used in<br>
Michigan. --- asking some of the traditional questions but also gathering<br>
info on what people would like to see in a church -- the type of<br>
ministries they would like to see and support. Then after that info is<br>
tabulated -- designing those ministries as we can use them. Print a<br>
brochure explaining our services and going back to those same people and<br>
inviting them to our services. We will begin small  -- like just<br>
contacting the neighbors in the area of our churches.<br>
<p>
I like what the Kettering, Ohio church is doing. Their church is a focal<br>
point for community activities. The New Hope church in Burtonsville, MD is<br>
doing the same type of thing.<br>
<p>
I want to eventually develop a program in both of our churches where we<br>
will have multiple seminars, workshops going on at the same time. We will<br>
have Bible oriented seminars but also for example, seminars and workshops<br>
on small engine repair, CPR classes, Parenting, and a "whole slew" of<br>
other things. This includes support groups for families of suicides, Grief<br>
Control, Singles and Single parents.  What has happened before is we also<br>
get non adventist volunteers who volunteer to teach some of the classes<br>
and/or they have expertise in other areas and can teach classes or<br>
seminars as well as our church members. I also know of junior age youth<br>
who can participate and teach for instance "kite making" etc and get all<br>
of their "peer" friends to VBS.<br>
<p>
This kind of a program, Steve will work and will break down a lot of pre-<br>
conceived ideas about Adventism and will get people from the community<br>
involved. Most people are curious about what Adventists believe and why. A<br>
wonderful opportunity to share the Gospel -- I said the Gospel -- not so<br>
much the Sabbath important as it is, but reveal the Lord of the Sabbath!<br>
<p>
Incidently Steve, I have a new visitor registration form that we are using<br>
in both of our churches on Sabbath. It gives us a lot more information<br>
than just their name and from what city. We are going to use those names<br>
to share literature, etc rather than the traditional "broadcasting" of<br>
literature. Why waste precious time giving literature to people who aren't<br>
interested in the first place when you can share with people who were<br>
interested enough to come and visit your church?<br>
<p>
The above are a few of the ideas that are fresh on my mind this AM. What<br>
do you think?  Perhaps you can understand now why I am saying that if a<br>
congregation are "do nothings" I am going to move on eventually to a<br>
congregation than has or will get the vision. Of course I realize a lot of<br>
responsibility rests on my shoulders to challenge the people.<br>

  I am reading The Great Contraversy and wanted to see if my impressions<br>
on what EGW is saying are 'correct'.<br>
<p>
  1) There is no eternal punishment for the wicked.  So what happens to<br>
them?<br>
<p>
  2) After death there is no consciousness.  Where are our spirits after<br>
we die?<br>
<p>
  3) I find it interesting that EGW acknowledges that we will be judged<br>
by our works.<br>

  4) I also noticed a interesting contradition.  On page 491-2 she<br>
quotes Gen 3:4-5 as satan's deception, yet in v 22 of the same chapter<br>
God says exactly what satan said in v 5.  I assume that what she meant<br>
was that the 'will not surely die' was the deception.<br>
<p>
  Next week I go back to riding the bus daily so will have more time to<br>
delve into this and other books.<br>

  Unofficial poll: how many are having the easter bunny over on Sunday?<br>

Dear SDAnetters,<br>
<p>
I have been a subscriber to SDAnet for a year now and have <br>
enjoyed the  discussions and interchange.  At times I have <br>
been an active participant  and at other times a silent <br>
listener.  My program at the University of  Utah will be <br>
finished very soon now and May 23 I will participate in  <br>
Commencement exercises and receive my hard-earned Ph.D.  The <br>
next 30 days will be exceedingly busy for me, but also an <br>
exciting time for me.  So far I have made trips to Columbus, <br>
Ohio and Houston, Texas for job  interviews.  The next three <br>
weeks I will visit Mobile, Alabama; Milwaukee,  Wisconsin; <br>
St. Paul, Minnesota, and perhaps Ann Arbor, Michigan.  <br>
Hopefully I will land my first career position among these <br>
prospects.<br>
<p>
I have been greatly blessed spiritually through SDAnet and <br>
want to thank each one of you for your participation.  I also <br>
want to thank those who have on occasion sent me personal <br>
messages.  This past year has been a period of spiritual <br>
growth and renewal for me and I thank each one of you who may <br>
have had played a role in this.<br>
<p>
As some of you know (and it may have been obvious to others), <br>
I have also struggled with deep doubts about my SDA faith.  I <br>
was born and raised a 4th-generation Adventist, but I left <br>
the church in my early twenties.  As the result of a severe <br>
car accident in 1980, I was rebaptized into the church <br>
through the loving efforts of my orthopedic surgeon (who <br>
happens to be related to the Vyhmeister's at Andrews <br>
University).  I was happy and active in the SDA church until <br>
I suffered a terrible misfortune at the  hands of an SDA <br>
employer which left me bankrupt and unable to be gainfully  <br>
employed.  I lost everything I owned including my home, my <br>
health, and a reason to live.  Mercifully, God spared my life <br>
after I made a serious suicide attempt in 1983 following this <br>
agonizing experience.  Finally, I moved on with my life and <br>
started graduate school and earned a masters degree in <br>
computer science.  Then I moved to Utah to pursue my Ph.D.  <br>
But my life in the SDA church was never to be the same again.<br>
<p>
I never really understood and may never totally understand <br>
why I had to suffer so much at the hands of the SDA church.  <br>
Until recently, I doubted that any good would ever come out <br>
of it.  Now I can testify that good did come from this <br>
disaster for me personally.  This disaster may have been the <br>
only way for me to be open to believe in God's true church.  <br>
Last summer I had the privilege of studying with two <br>
beautiful young ladies who were serving full-time missions <br>
for the LDS church.  They put their education on hold to <br>
serve their church at their own expense.  During the ensuing <br>
six months, I studied diligently, thirsty for truth and <br>
hungry for the true love of Christ in my life.  On November <br>
14, 1991, I was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of <br>
Latter-Day Saints<br>
<p>
I have found peace and great spiritual truths which give my <br>
life real meaning now.  I am not a guinea pig down here on <br>
this sinful earth, a victim of the war in heaven.  Rather I <br>
am a child of my Heavenly Father who cares deeply about my <br>
eternal progress and my sojourn on this earth.  My life on <br>
this earth is an opportunity for growth--to become more like <br>
my Father in Heaven-physically, spiritually, and mentally.  <br>
The sacrifice of Jesus Christ has made it possible for me to <br>
return to my Heavenly Father and live once again in His holy <br>
presence.  For this, I am most grateful.<br>
<p>
If any of you have any comments or questions, I encourage you <br>
to respond to me personally.  I will have this email account<br>
for one more month.<br>
<p>

Responding to Paul's comment that many church members do not know what<br>
the gospel is all about...<br>
I've just been reading a new book about sin and salvation.  Its title<br>
is rather catchy: A Pharisee's Guide to Perfect Holiness.  Actually,<br>
the contents are a little less flamboyant than the title.  By George<br>
Knight, it sells at the ABC for $14.95.<br>
<p>
By the way, Paul, where do you pastor? I'd like to attend your church!<br>

[The words of Eric Snyder]<br>
       If my study on this is correct, the SDA position is basically<br>
     the same as the Jehovah's Witnesses.  That after death, there is<br>
     no immaterial part that survives.  Only after the Resurrection,<br>
     will the entire person be brought back.  At that time, the wicked<br>
     will be Annialated.  The righteous will be given eternal life.<br>
[The end effect is quite the same for SDA and JW.  However, the setting of <br>
eschatology in which it occurs is quite different.  SDA beliefs were <br>
certainly known to Charles Russell, founder of JW's, and it is likely <br>
he borrowed this idea.  SCT]<br>
<p>
 <br>
       I have to admit.  I have thought a lot about this issue and have<br>
     come to some conclusions.  Our Church, would not teach annialationism.<br>
     As far as there being a Soul/Spirit that survives death, I believe the<br>
     honest SDA or Evangelical would need to admit that there are<br>
     Scriptures supporting both positions.  What about the Luke 16 parable<br>
     about Lazurus and the Rich man.  Yes I realize that it was a parable,<br>
     but would Jesus use an untruthful example to teach ?  Also, Paul states<br>
     that to be absent from the body is to be with the Lord.  Do you not get<br>
     a sense that Paul considers his body like a "shell"?  I have also spent<br>
     time discussing the Luke 23:43 passage with the Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>
     The difference is the placement of the comma, of which I believe in the<br>
     original Greek was not present.  If the comma is before the word today<br>
     than, Jesus is telling the thief that even though he is about to die,<br>
     the thief will see Jesus that day in a much better place called paradise.<br>
     On the other hand, if you place the comma "after" the word "today", it<br>
     means that Jesus is emphasizing His point by stating that he is telling<br>
     the thief on that day.<br>
         There are many other passages that I believe that could be used to<br>
     argue both sides.....I am certainly open to discuss this with anyone<br>
     further......<br>

[No.  Good point.  Only God the Father knows, so that in a sense is a<br>

I continue the series of good trends I see happening in the church.<br>
I focus on the phenomenon of Seventh-day Adventists becoming more<br>
well-recognized in the world at large, and giving of themselves in the <br>
process.  There are many we could name.<br>
<p>
In the realm of politics, we have seen an Adventist prime minister<br>
in Uganda (so what if he came to power in a revolution) Dr. Kisekka.<br>
In Jamaica there have been several cabinet ministers who were SDA.<br>
There is an Adventist president of the quasi-independent Pacific <br>
island of Palau.  As more SDA's become involved in politics and working <br>
for justice, we are in a sense returning to the spirit of the early <br>
movement, which was strongly anti-slavery, non-combatant, and<br>
pro-temperance, as well as strong fighters for religious liberty.<br>
<p>
In the performing arts, SDA's now inhabit all venues from jazz to CCM <br>
to classical.  Herbert Blomstedt of the San Francisco symphony<br>
has led other SDA professional musicians to set their sights higher.<br>
Take 6 has won several Grammy awards in the gospel/jazz arena.<br>
And while names like Patty Cabrera, Bret Barry, Tom Prasada-Rao,<br>
and Ann Trubey aren't household words in the Christian music industry as yet,<br>
they are out there and selling enough records to live, with wider<br>
distribution than (practicing) SDA artists have had before.  Of course<br>
we shouldn't forget Clifton Davis who makes a career both as a singer<br>
and as an actor.<br>
<p>
In the health area members of our church are also gaining recognition,<br>
and none more so than Dr. Ben Carson of Johns Hopkins Univ., the<br>
pediatric neurosurgeon.  His books have a wide circulation in mainstream<br>
and Christian bookstores alike.<br>
<p>
I'm excited enough that Adventists are starting to come out of the salt<br>
shaker and spread out to the world, that I won't dwell on our tendency<br>
to hero-worship anyone within our church that becomes famous.  We won't<br>
stress that so many churches asked Ben Carson to speak that it was hurting<br>
his work and his department now demands a $1000 speaking fee whenever<br>
he gives a talk.  People coming out of their shells is the beginning of <br>
an alive and vibrant post-institutional Adventism, and it's something we<br>
will need a lot more of in future.<br>

Some time ago I put together a series of posts for s.r.c. on the<br>
topics of what happens after death.  In the process I collected<br>
about 600 relevent texts which included the texts favored by those<br>
who wish to prove immortal souls etc.  I also have a collection<br>
of quotes for Bible dictionaries and such that show that Bible<br>
scholars who are trying to write objective analyses of what the<br>
Hebrew and Greek really mean -- that these people have documented<br>
the truths of Adventism on these topics of souls, spirits, . . . .<br>
<p>
Anyway, I did post my series to SDAnet as well.  I recieved a lot<br>
of positive feedback from s.r.c. people.  I received a few positive<br>
notes from SDAnet people and lots of flack from SDAneters who felt<br>
it was consuming their valuable time.  So, I won't re-post the material,<br>
it is rather exhaustive for those who simply want one or two proof<br>
texts.  But if anyone would like copies I can email to you.  Here are the<br>
topics I developed and posted:<br>
<p>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-0 - INTRODUCTION<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-1 - HISTORY<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-2 - SOULS in the GRAVE<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-3 - OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCES<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-4 - SOUL SLEEP<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-5 - RICH MAN &amp; LAZARUS<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-6 - ASBESTOS WICKED<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-7 - THIEF ON CROSS<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-8 - ESCAPE HATCHES<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-9 - SOUL PRISONS?<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-10 - NOT STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN<br>
   DEATH &amp; HELL-11 - was it SAMUEL who talked to SAUL?<br>
<p>
Several of these deserve to be re-written having read a new book by<br>
a Baptist who does a better job than we do of proving Biblical soul<br>
sleep.  I have two books by men who grew up in the traditional views<br>
of eternal souls and hell fire.  They had independently been<br>
dissappointed that the sermons and books of their churches did not<br>
really offer Biblical analysis, being more inclined to quote Plato<br>
and or Augustine who quotes a lot of Ploto, and of course other<br>
trandition rather than Biblical arguments.  So, each independently<br>
set out to write a book that set asside tradition and really went<br>
at it from the Bible.  Their books ended up sounding like good SDA<br>
books on the state of the dead.  No, their books are more comprehensive<br>
and contain better proofs than the SDA books, to prove the SDA<br>
doctrines.  Very interresting indeed.<br>
<p>

[Dave, I think that if there is a good excerpt in the series on what is <br>

  Why is that?  You don't know of them or you doubt what they are saying<br>
with regrads to homeschooling children?  My family is currently<br>
re-evaluating our eating habits because of their presentations of the<br>
SDA health message.  We are also using their books about homeschooling<br>
as a basis for how we are teaching our children.  We do this after<br>
seeing first hand the results in some homeschool families at church.<br>

I have not read Dr. Moore's book on home schooling, so I am out of step in <br>
questioning the utility of his work.  I retract my statement.<br>
<p>
If there is any problem with home schooling, it's more likely in the <br>
implementation of techniques rather than in home schooling itself. <br>
Some of the kindest,skilled, and well-rounded friends I have were home<br>
schooled at young ages.  I have seen families brought into the church<br>
as a result of contacts our church has with home schoolers.<br>
<p>
By the same token, I have seen churches split over the the issue of home<br>
schooling, and I have seen children emotionally scarred for life by such<br>
experiences.  The problem exists in that there is a certain class<br>
of emotionally misadjusted parents who are more likely to home school <br>
their children when the best thing for the kid would be to get away <br>
from the house.<br>
<p>
(The same category applies to some parents who choose to start their <br>
children late to school.)<br>

 From the flyleaf:<br>
     "The Fire That Consumes", by Edward William  Fudge,  is  a  provocative<br>
     biblical  and  historical  study of the controversial doctrine of final<br>
     punishment.  The book recommends itself by  its  careful  and  thorough<br>
     research.   Fudge  investigates both Old and New Testaments on the doc-<br>
     trine of final punishment -- but he does not stop there.  He also exam-<br>
     ines  the  Jewish  writings between the Testaments as  well as relevant<br>
     material from the Apostolic Fathers down to the present.<br>
<p>
     Like a tireless detective searching  out  every  clue,  Fudge  employes<br>
     biblical  exegesis, systematic theology and a critical eye as he delves<br>
     into a much-neglected subject.  No assumptions are left unchallenged --<br>
     including the author's own -- and several are called into serious ques-<br>
     tion.  Writes Fudge:<br>
<p>
     "This study has elicited a  spectrum  of  emotions  in  the  author  --<br>
     despair and relief, anxiety and peace, incredulity and final surrender.<br>
     The position presented must stand or fall on  the  evidence,  and  that<br>
     evidence  is  not  personal  desire, human philosophy or ecclesiastical<br>
     tradition but the living and abiding, infallible Word of God.<br>
<p>
     Edward William Fudge is an author, publisher, preacher and lay scholar.<br>
     After  earning  a  master's  degree  in biblical languages from Abilene<br>
     Christian University, Abilene, Texas, he studied at Covenant  Theologi-<br>
     cal  Seminary  and  Eden  Theological Seminary, both in St. Louis, Mis-<br>
     souri.<br>
<p>
     An active member of the Evangelical Theological Society, Mr. Fudge also<br>
     belongs  to the Society of Biblical Literature.  His articles have been<br>
     published in the Evangelical Theological Society's Journal, and he  has<br>
     delivered  papers  at the society's regional and national meetings.  He<br>
     has also written for "Christianity Today", "Review of Books  and  Reli-<br>
     gion", "Verdict" and other periodicals.<br>
<p>
2nd Book:<br>
<p>
Book by George Wisbrock, "DEATH &amp; the  SOUL".<br>
Recently  published  by  ZOE-Life Books, P.O. Box 5171, Oakbrook, IL. 60522-<br>
5171.<br>
<p>
A friend of mine met the author quite by accident while  traveling  and  was<br>
later  invited  to read and contribute to the pre-publication manuscript.  I<br>
am told that George Wisbrock is  a  Baptist.   Nowhere  does  the  book  say<br>
anything about his church.<br>
<p>
Forward by F.  F.  Bruce,  Emeritus  Professor,  University  of  Manchester,<br>
England.<br>
<p>
<p>
     It would be a great step forward if those who set themselves to expound<br>
     the  Biblical  teaching  on  these matters defined their terms clearly.<br>
     This is particularly so with the terms  "immortal"  and  "immortality".<br>
     In  Biblical  usage immortality belongs inherently to God alone; other-<br>
     wise it belongs only to those to whom God gives it.  Again, where human<br>
     beings  are  concerned,  Immortality  in the Bible is predicated of the<br>
     body, not of the soul.<br>
<p>
     In our western culture, thought and  language  about  immortality  have<br>
     been  largely  determined by Plato's doctrine of the immortality of the<br>
     soul. But any attempt to combine Plato's doctrine with the teaching  of<br>
     the Bible can lead only to confusion.  For Plato did not mean by immor-<br>
     tality what the biblical writers mean by it, and what  Plato  meant  by<br>
     the soul is not what the biblical writers mean by the soul.<br>
<p>
     For the Christian, the  hope  of  immortality  is  bound  up  with  the<br>
     resurrection  of Christ, who "has brought life and immortality to light<br>
     through the gospel."  By His conquest of death Christ has made . . . .<br>
<p>
Introduction by David Lounsberry, M.D.<br>
<p>
     In "Death and the Soul", George Wisbrock has given us a clear,  logical<br>
     and  driving explanation of death by exploring key texts from all parts<br>
     of the Bible.  He carefully lays the groundwork for a proper  interpre-<br>
     tation of many Biblical passages which deal with the meanings of death,<br>
     soul and spirit.  At the same time he emphasizes the importance of  our<br>
     honesty when considering these statements.<br>
<p>
     "Death and the Soul" pointedly reveals both philosophical and theologi-<br>
     cal  inconsistencies  in  the many popular man-made theories, supersti-<br>
     tions and myths about the meaning of death.  In  doing  this,  it  also<br>
     explains why all the vastly different beliefs about the supposed desti-<br>
     nation of human souls immediately after death could not possibly all be<br>
     true.<br>
<p>
     Surprisingly, even shockingly,  to  varying  degrees  these  unbiblical<br>
     beliefs  are  presently  being  taught  in  many contemporary Christian<br>
     churches. This book is therefore one that the entire Christian  commun-<br>
     ity  needs  to  study thoroughly with Bible in hand.  It is an absolute<br>
     "must read" for every Bible class teacher, minister and seminarian.<br>
<p>
     We are all deeply indebted to George for his seven years  of  research,<br>
     thought  and  prayer  during  the  preparation of this treatise.  It is<br>
     clearly the most important book I have ever read  on  the  subjects  of<br>
     death,  life after death, and the nature of man.  Through this book the<br>
     Biblical teachings about Everlasting  Life  take  on  new  clarity  and<br>
     relevance. Through this book we learn the answer to Job's question, "If<br>
     a man die, shall he live AGAIN?"  (Job 14:14).<br>
<p>
On page 9, George Wisbrock writes:<br>
<p>
     ". . . . Yet very few people alive today, if any at all, have  actually<br>
     developed  a belief that they have an immortal "soul" or an "immaterial<br>
     self" dwelling within their physical bodies  because  of  a  [thorough]<br>
     personal study of the Bible.  Instead, most people have merely accepted<br>
     whatever they have been told about "the soul" being both immaterial and<br>
     immortal  without  ever  questioning  the basis of that belief.  (Until<br>
     doing extensive research for this book, I, too, was among those who had<br>
     never  questioned mankind's traditional belief in the immaterial nature<br>
     of an alleged immortal soul living within the human body.)"<br>

Soul - Nelson's Expository  Dictionary  of  the  Old  Testament,  edited  by<br>
Merrill F. Unger and William White,  Jr, pp. 388, 389:<br>
<p>
     The real difficulty of the term is seen in the inability of almost  all<br>
     English  translations  to  find a consistent equivalent or even a small<br>
     group of high-frequency equivalents for the term.  The KJV  alone  uses<br>
     over  28 different English terms for this one Hebrew word.  The problem<br>
     with the English term "soul" is that no actual equivalent of  the  term<br>
     or  the  idea  behind  it  is  represented in the Hebrew language.  The<br>
     Hebrew system of thought does not incude the combination or  opposition<br>
     of  the  terms  "body"  and "soul," which are really Greek and Latin in<br>
     origin.<br>
<p>
     poetic line, nephesh is often used as the  parallel  for  the  speaker,<br>
     primary personal subject, and even for God, as in Ps. 11:5.<br>
<p>
     [nephesh] enlightens many well known passages, such as Ps. 119:109: "My<br>
     life  [nephesh] is continually in my hand, Yet I do not forget Thy law"<br>
     (NASB)<br>
<p>
Merrill F. Unger, Unger's Bible Handbook, p. 267:<br>
<p>
     Hebrew poetry, unlike Occidental verse, does not posses meter or rhyme.<br>
     Its  basic  structure is parallelism of thought arrangement rather than<br>
     word  arrangements.   Common  types  of  such   parallelism   are   (1)<br>
     'synonymous  parallelism',  where  the second line or stich repeats the<br>
     first, giving a distich or couplet (cf. Job 3:11-12; 4:17; Ps 2:4); (2)<br>
     'antithetic parallelism', in which the second line presents a contrast-<br>
     ing thought to emphasize the first  (Job 42:5;  Ps  34:10);  (3)  'syn-<br>
     thetic  parallelism',  in  which  the second and succeeding lines add a<br>
     progressive flow of thought to develop the first (Job 4:19-21; Ps 1:3).<br>
<p>
"The Jewish Encyclopedia":<br>
<p>
     Immortality of the Soul - The belief that the soul continues its  exis-<br>
     tance  after the dissolution of the body is a mtter of philosophical or<br>
     theological speculation rather than of simple faith, and is accordingly<br>
     nowhere  expressly  taught  in  Holy  Scripture . . . The belief in the<br>
     immortality of the soul came  to  the  Jews  from  contact  with  Greek<br>
     thought  and  chiefly  through  the  philosophy of Plato, its principal<br>
     exponent, who was led to it through Orphic and Eleusinian mysteries  in<br>
     which Babylonian and Egyptian views were strangely blended.<br>
<p>
     SOUL - . . . . .  Only through the contact of the Jews with Persian and<br>
     Greek  thought did the idea of a disembodied soul, having its own indi-<br>
     viduality, take root in Judaism and find its expression  in  the  later<br>
     Biblical books . . . .<br>
<p>
The "New Catholic Encyclopedia", Vol. 18 (NewYork:  McGraw-Hill,  1967),  p.<br>

<p>
     Nepes comes from an original root probably meaning to breathe, and thus<br>
     the noun form means neck or throat opened for breathing, thence, breath<br>
     of life.  Since breath distinguishes the living from  the  dead,  nepes<br>
     came  to mean life or self or simply individual life.  Nepes is used in<br>
     regard to both  animals  and  humans.   If  life  is  human,  nepes  is<br>
     equivalent to the person, the "I."  After death the nepes goes to sheol<br>
     [the grave].<br>
<p>
     The above summary indicates that there is no dichotomy of body and soul<br>
     in the OT.  The Israelite saw things concretely, in their totality, and<br>
     thus he considered men as persons and  not  as  composites.   The  term<br>
     'nepes,'  though  translated by our word soul, never means soul as dis-<br>
     tinct from the body or the individual person.  Other words  in  the  OT<br>
     such  as  sprit,  flesh,  and  heart  also signify the human person and<br>
     differ only as various aspects of the same being.<br>
<p>
"Encyclopedia Judaica, Vol. 15 (New York: Macmillan Company, 1971), p. 175:<br>
<p>
     Only in the post-biblical period, did a clear and firm  belief  in  the<br>
     immortality of the soul . . . . . become one of the cornerstones of the<br>
     Jewish and Christian faiths.<br>
<p>
"The Zondrevan Pictoral Encyclopedia of the Bible, Vol. 5 , p. 496:<br>
<p>
     The English translation of 'nephesh' by the term "soul" has  too  often<br>
     been  misunderstood as teaching a bipartite (soul and body): dichotomy)<br>
     or  tripartite  (body,  soul  and  spirit:  trichotomy)   anthropology.<br>
     Equally  misleading is the interpretation which too radically separates<br>
     soul from body as in the Greek view of human nature.  Porteus states it<br>
     well  when  he  says,  "The  Hebrew could not conceive of a disembodied<br>
     nephesh, though he could use 'nephesh' with or  without  the  adjective<br>
     'dead,' for corpse (e.g., Lev 19:28; Num 6:6)" (ibid).  Or as R.B. Lau-<br>
     rin has suggested. "To the Hebrew, man was not a 'body'  and  a  'soul'<br>
     but  rather  a  'body-soul,' a unity of vital power"  (cf. BDT, sS.V.).<br>
     The most significant text is Genesis 2:7, "then the Lord God formed man<br>
     of  the dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath<br>
     of life; and man became a living being [nephesh]."<br>
<p>
"The Encyclopedia Dictionary of the Bible", p. 2287:<br>
<p>
     The original meaning of 'nefes' and the  concepts  that  are  connected<br>
     with  it  show  that  the 'nefes' (like the ruah) of a man was not con-<br>
     sidered in Israel to be a sort of duplicate of him, as the 'ka' was  in<br>
     Egypt, or the 'psuche' among the ancient Greeks (e.g., Hom. Iliad 1,3),<br>
     or was whatever words various primitive people have for the "soul."<br>
<p>
     (C) It is sometimes thought  that  the  Isrealites  believed  that  the<br>
     'nefes'  could exist apart from the body and that, after a man's death,<br>
     his 'nefes' continued to exist in the nether world.  But the OT  really<br>
     gives  no  basis  for  such  an opinion.  When it speaks of rescuing or<br>
     delivering a man's 'nefes' from  the  nether  world  (Ps  30:3;  86:13;<br>
     89:49; 116:4; Is 38:17; Prv 23:14), it means no more than that this man<br>
     is saved from dying (cfr. Ps 33:19; 56:14; 78:50; Jb 33:18, 22, 28)  or<br>
     that  he  was snatched from mortal danger; in all these cases the man's<br>
     'nefes' is merely a synonym for the man himself, with some emphasis  on<br>
     him  as a "living" being (cfr., e.g., the parallelism in Ps 16:10, "You<br>
     will not abandon my 'nefes' to the nether world, nor  will  You  suffer<br>
     Your  faithful one to undergo corruption"; so also in Ps 49:16; cfr. Jb<br>
     13:14, where "my nefes" is parallel to "my flesh").<br>
<p>
Random House, "The Dictionary of the New Testament", p. 707<br>
<p>
     Man became a 'soul' because God, who alone  was  the  Living  One,  had<br>
     breathed  into  his  nostrils the breath of life.  This soul was not in<br>
     itself immortal . . . .  The  Greek  word  'psyche',  like  the  Hebrew<br>
     'nephesh',  may  be  translated not only by 'soul,' but also by 'life,'<br>
     'person,' or even by a pronoun: 'I' or 'someone.'<br>
<p>
"Dictionary of Bible Theology", p. 565, 566:<br>
<p>
     "Far from being a "part" which joins with the body to  form  the  human<br>
     being,  the soul denotes the entire man, insofar as he is animated by a<br>
     spirit of life . . . A soul is a man, it is someone . . . .<br>
<p>
     The concept of the body common in the N.T. defines  man  as  a  complex<br>
     orgganism, a whole, a unity.  It is not simply the "form" of the organ-<br>
     ism, as opposed to the substance which might be its content, but a mode<br>
     of  being  essential to and constitutive of the human person.  There is<br>
     no human existence which is not bodily existence (cf. 1 Cor. 15:35ff),<br>
<p>
"Evangelical Dictionary of Theology", p. 1041:<br>
<p>
     Mankind has breath, or spirit . . . when a person dies  the  spirit  is<br>
     returned to God (Ecc 12:7).  Life and death, therefore, are represented<br>
     in the BIble as a giving and a withdrawing of God's breath, or  spirit;<br>
     for  all  created life, including humanity, is utterly dependent on Him<br>
     (Ps. 104). . . . As the principle of life, spirit is ascribed to beasts<br>
     also (Gen. 6:17; 7:15).<br>
<p>
"New Catholic Encyclopedia", Vol 13, p. 517:<br>
<p>
     Since God is the life-giver, life breath comes from Him and  man  lives<br>
     as long as God's breath remains in Him (Jb 27:3; Is 42:5; Za 12:1). . .<br>
     .  In creatures with lungs, breathing is a natural sign of life, and in<br>
     many  languages the term connoting physical breath takes on the meaning<br>
     of what it signifies, life.  So in Hebrew, 'ruach' came to mean  breath<br>
     as  significative of life in men (Gn 6:17; Ez 37:10) and in animals (Gn<br>
     7:22; Ps 104: 29).<br>
<p>
"A Theological Word Book of the Bible", p. 234:<br>
<p>
     For the Hebrews man is of the earth; he is flesh, Isa.  31:3.   In  the<br>
     post-  exilic  period  'Spirit' became a virtual synonym for 'soul' and<br>
     'heart', the seat of intelligence and emotion in  man  (cf.  Job  20:3,<br>
     32:18,  Isa  57:15,  Dan 5:20).  Human characteristics are described in<br>
     'spiritual' terms.<br>
<p>
"A Theological Word Book of the Bible", p. 144:<br>
<p>
     SOUL (nephesh) means the living being.  We might render it 'person'  or<br>
     'personality',  so  long  as we remember that in Hebrew thought even an<br>
     animal is a 'nephesh' . . .<br>
<p>
     SPIRIT (ruach), literaly wind, and in  a  person,  breath,  means  that<br>
     which is the mark of the living as opposed to the dead.  This, however,<br>
     does not distinguish it from soul (nephesh), and one would  be  tempted<br>
     to  make a distinction by calling 'ruach' the whole non-physical aspect<br>
     of man were it not that it is difficult to say that the Hebrews did not<br>
     conceive  both 'ruach' and 'nephesh' as in some way physical and having<br>
     substance, modern notions of immateriality being beyond them.  Pedersen<br>
     differentiates  thus:  "'ruach' is the motive power of the 'soul'" (op.<br>
     cit., p. 105), and illustrates from Ezra 1:1  'The Lord stirred up  the<br>
     spirit  of  Cyrus',  i.e.  moved  Cyrus to do something, similarly Hag.<br>
     1:14.  "Ruach' is frequently used of mental processes, especially viva-<br>
     city, impulse, anger.<br>
<p>
"Dictonary of the Bible", pp. 836-839:<br>
<p>
     The word "soul" is used in  English  Bibles  to  translate  the  Hebrew<br>
     'nepes'. The translation is unfortunate; soul in common speech reflects<br>
     a complex of ideas which go back to  Greek  philosophy  as  refined  by<br>
     medieval  scholasticism.  In the philosophy of Plato the soul is a pure<br>
     spiritual principle, the subject of thought really  distinct  from  the<br>
     body,  and  immortal; . . . . .  In Aristotelian philosophy the soul is<br>
     united with the body as a form united to matter; it is the  subject  of<br>
     thought  but  its spirituality and immortality are less evident . . . .<br>
     Then NT employs the Greek 'psyche', tranlated in English by soul . .  .<br>
     .  The  NT use of the term is heavily dependent on the OT use and shows<br>
     little or no effect of Greek philosophyical concepts . . . .  In  these<br>
     uses, as in the use of 'psyche' to signify life, the NT adds nothing to<br>
     the OT conception of 'nepes' . . . .  In common  speech,  however,  the<br>
     Greek  concept of 'psyche' as a distinct spiritual principle is usually<br>
     read into the term, and thus the concept of salvation and eternal  life<br>
     may  become  Platonic  rather than Biblical.  The 'psyche' in the NT is<br>
     still the totality of the self as a living and conscious  subject,  and<br>
     it is the totality of the self which is saved for eternal life.<br>
<p>
"Zondervan Pictoral Encyclopedia of the Bible", p. 497:<br>
<p>
     It should be noted that the  NT  does  not  make  a  clear  distinction<br>
     between  'psuche' and 'pneuma' (spirit).   First Thessalonians 5:23 and<br>
     Hebrews 4:12 are exceptions, and can best be understood not as  affirm-<br>
     ing  a  trichotomous  anthropology but as figures of speech . . . .  To<br>
     derive exact phsychological descriptions from these two  statements  is<br>
     pressing the non-technical language of Scriptures too far.<br>
<p>
On 1 Thes 5:23 -- "Manual of Christian Doctrine", L.  Berkhof,  (Eerdman's),<br>

     distinct elements in man rather than as three different aspects of man.<br>
     When Jesus summarizes the first table of the law by saying, "Thou shalt<br>
     love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with  all  thy  soul  and<br>
     with all thy mind," in Matt. 22:37, He does not have in mind three dis-<br>
     tinct substances.  Such expressions simply serve to emphasize the  fact<br>
     that the whole man in intended.<br>
<p>
"Death and the Soul", by George Wisbrock (a Baptist), pp 207,208:<br>
<p>
     Plato<br>
<p>
     Plato (427-347 B. C.)  was  greatly  influenced  by  Pythagoras.   Like<br>
     Pythagoras,  Plato  believed an immortal soul dwelt within man and that<br>
     it would separate from man's physical body at death.  He also  believed<br>
     this  immortal soul could reincarnate into another human body, and that<br>
     it would transmigrate into lower class plants and  animals  if  it  had<br>
     been extremely evil in supposed previous lifetimes.<br>
<p>
     Plato further believed that if a particular soul had been "good enough"<br>
     during its period of punishment here on earth, then its perpetual cycle<br>
     of incarnation  and  transmigration  would  cease.   Once  a  soul  had<br>
     redeemed  itself  by appeasing the offended god or goddess who had sent<br>
     it to earth, it would supposedly return to the offended  diety's  pres-<br>
     ence either in the heavens above or in the earth below.<br>
<p>
     Further still, Plato, many of the other  Greek  philosopehrs,  and  the<br>
     majority  of  the  Greek  population during his lifetime, believed that<br>
     their gods and goddesses were in control of all the  affairs  of  man's<br>
     life  on  earth  --  as  well as of all the alleged spiritual abodes in<br>
     which 'souls' were then believed to reside both before birth and  after<br>
     death.<br>
<p>
     More than any other Greek philosopher, Plato was  responsible  for  the<br>
     spread  into  Western  minds  of  the false teaching about the alledged<br>
     immortality or the soul and of its assumed ability to  reincarnate  and<br>
     transmigrate  into  various kinds of bodies.  Because of the prominence<br>
     given to Plato as the person most responsible for the development of  a<br>
     belief  in  the  continuation of a soul's life after death, much of our<br>
     current duscussion will focus upon what he wrote about  death  and  the<br>
     soul.<br>
<p>
     Plato and Socrates<br>
<p>
     Plato's thinking about the immortality of the soul was no doubt heavily<br>
     influenced  during  his  twenty year stay in Egypt.  He was also influ-<br>
     enced by the thinking of Socrates (469?-399 B.C..), his most  respected<br>
     teacher.  Several  of  Plato's  writings  discuss  Socrates'  life  and<br>
     thoughts about life after death.  Almost all  of  what  we  know  about<br>
     Socrates  has  come  to  us form the pen of Plato, who worote about the<br>
     last days of Socrates' life in his works 'Phaedo, Euthyphro, The  Apol-<br>
     ogy, and Crito'.<br>
<p>
     Some scholars believe that many  of  the  comments  Plato  ascribed  to<br>
     Socrates  about  the  existence  of an assumed indwelling soul were far<br>
     more an expression of his own thinking than they were of Socrates' per-<br>
     sonal beliefs . . . .<br>
<p>
"A Dictionary of Christian Theology", (Westminster Press, 1969), p. 316:<br>
<p>
     The ancient Church inherited from Greek thought the notion of  a  soul-<br>
     substance  which  was by nature immortal, and this conception was often<br>
     intertwined with biblical teaching about resurrection.   In the  bibli-<br>
     cal view a man dies and literally ceases to exist . . . .  On the Greek<br>
     view death is merely a change in the manner of existence.<br>
<p>

<p>
     On Justin Martyr (A.D. 100-163) -- In the fragment of his  treatise  on<br>

     the soul, the soul the dwelling of the  spirit."   We  find  a  similar<br>
     statement  in  his  dialogue  with Trypho; he makes Trypho say, "As the<br>
     body without the soul is dead, so is the soul  without  the  quickening<br>
     spirit (zootikon pneuma)," proving that Justin thought this distinction<br>
     to be  one  recognized  by  Jews  as  well  as  Christians.   Similarly<br>
     Irenaeus,  "The  soul  and the spirit are certainly a part of man, cer-<br>
     tainly not the man; for the perfect man consists in the coming and  the<br>
     union of the soul receiving the Spirit of the Father, and the admixture<br>
     of the fleshly  nature  which  was  molded  after  the  image  of  God"<br>
     (Robert's translation).  Many of the Gnostic heresies assumed this tri-<br>
     chotomy.<br>
<p>
"The Encyclopedia of the Lutheran Church", 1965, p. 2236:<br>
<p>
     Even a church father like Origen, steeped as he was in  Greek  philoso-<br>
     phy,  discarded  the idea of a pre-existent soul found in Neo-Platonism<br>
     because such a notion was contrary to the Christian concept of  God  as<br>
     the  Creator  of  all  things.   If God alone is eternal and all things<br>
     including man are created by God 'ex nihilo'  [out  of  nothing],  then<br>
     souls  cannot be immortal and uncreated as Plato taught.  Most authori-<br>
     ties agree that an immaterial and immortal soul which is thought of  as<br>
     some  part  of man separable from his mortal body is neither a biblical<br>
     nor a Christian idea.<br>
<p>
"New Catholic Encyclopedia", p. 467:<br>
<p>
     The Soul in the OT means not a part of man, but, the whole man  --  man<br>
     as  a living being.  Similarly, in the NT it signifies human life:  the<br>
     life of the individual, conscious subject . . . . the  Bible  does  not<br>
     speak of the survival of an immaterial soul.  This is not surprising if<br>
     one considers that categories of Greek philosophy are not likely to  be<br>
     found in Semitic copies of literature.<br>
<p>
Wesleyan scholar, J.A. Beet, "Immortality of the Soul", pp. 53,54:<br>
<p>
     The phrase, "The soul immortal', so frequent  and  conspicious  in  the<br>
     writings  of  Plato, we have not found in pre-Christian literature out-<br>
     side the influence of Greek Philosophy; nor have we found it in  Chris-<br>
     tian  literature  until  the later part of the second century.  We have<br>
     noticed that all the earliest Christian writers  who  use  this  phrase<br>
     were  familiar  with the teachings of Plato; that one of these, Tertul-<br>
     lian, expressly refers both the phrase and doctrine to  him;  and  that<br>
     the  early  Christian writers never support this doctrine by appeals to<br>
     the Bible, but only by arguments simlilar to those of Plato . . . .  We<br>
     have  failed  to find any trace of this doctrine in the Bible . . .  It<br>
     is altogether alien, both in phrase and thought, to  the  teachings  of<br>
     Christ and his apostles.<br>
<p>
Lutherin writer J. A. Kantonen in "The Christian Hope", pp. 28,29:<br>
<p>
     It has been characteristic of Western thought ever since Plato to  dis-<br>
     tinguish  sharply  between the soul and the body.  The body is supposed<br>
     to be composed of matter, and the soul of spirit.  The body is a prison<br>
     from  which  the  soul is liberated at death to carry on its own proper<br>
     nonphysical existence.  Becuase of its immaterial spiritual nature  the<br>
     soul has been considered indestructible . . .<br>
<p>
     This way of thinking is entirely  foreighn   to  the  Bible.   True  to<br>
     Scripture  and definitely rejecting the Greek view, the Christian creed<br>
     says, not "I believe in the immortality of the soul" but "I believe  in<br>
     the resurrection of the body."<br>
<p>
     its own.  It would be more in keeping with the New Testament  to  speak<br>
     of  soul-life rather than of the soul as such.  'Psuche' is the unique-<br>
     ness or the individuality of a  particular  life,  not  some  separable<br>
     indestructible substance.<br>
<p>
Paul Tillich, January 14, 1960, while addressing the New  York  Society  for<br>
Clinical Psychiatry, on the "Meaning of Health":<br>
<p>
     "Man should not be considered as a composite of several levels, such as<br>
     body,  soul,  spirit, but as a multidimensional unity . . . .  In every<br>
     dimension of life, all dimensions are potentially or actually present .<br>
     .  . . He is a unity which unites all dimensions.  This doctrine stands<br>
     against the dualistic theory which sees man as  composed  of  soul  and<br>
     body;  or  body  and mind; or body, soul, and spirit, etc.  Man is one,<br>
     uniting within himself all dimensions of life -- an  insight  which  we<br>
     partly  owe  to the recent development of medicine, especially psychia-<br>
     try.<br>
<p>
Rudolph Bultmann, "Theology of the New Testament", pp. 203,204:<br>
<p>
     Let us cast a glance once again at the doctrine of the  immortality  of<br>
     the  soul.   It cannot be explained by weakness of faith on the part of<br>
     the church that it took over a point of view which  came  from  such  a<br>
     different  source  --  that  of  Greek  philosophy,  and was so utterly<br>
     foreign to its own essential  teaching.   Somewhere  in  the  Christian<br>
     faith there must have been some opening through which this foreign doc-<br>
     trine could penetrate.  Assuredly, from the Biblical standpoint, it  is<br>
     God  alone  who  possesses  immortality.   The oppinion that we men are<br>
     imortal because our soul is of an indestructible, devine,  essence  is,<br>
     once for all, irreconcilable with the Biblical view of God and man.<br>
<p>
"The Encyclopedia of the Lutheran Church", p. 2236:<br>
<p>
     The term soul is being  used  less  and  less  in  current  theological<br>
     thought and literature.  Even religious literature, sermons, and modern<br>
     translations of the Bible avoid the word soul.   For  example,  if  one<br>
     turns  to  Matthew  16:26,  he  discovers  that the Greek word for soul<br>
     (psyche) is translated "soul" in the King James Version and by Moffatt,<br>
     but as "life" in the Revised Standard Version and by Weymouth, and with<br>
     the word "self" in the new English Bible.  All of which indicates  that<br>
     in  modern  English and American usage terms like self, ego, life, per-<br>
     son, or personality are being used in preference to the word soul.<br>

Steve,<br>
<p>
I don't personally know of any bad press on my neighbors the Moores.<br>
<p>
But I was within ear shot when he was explaining how things ran awry<br>
with a non-SDA employee who basically took over the way his institute<br>
was being run.  Moore's ended up having to leave the organization<br>
they founded in our little town of Washougal.  I don't have the details<br>
on his new organization or if its even a formalized enterprize.  But<br>
hey, I could call and find out the latest on what he is up to.<br>

On Thu, 16 Apr 1992 00:37:40 -0400 (EDT) you said:<br>
<i>&gt;Scott Mattes writes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  I am reading The Great Contraversy and wanted to see if my impressions</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;on what EGW is saying are 'correct'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;........... stuff deleted .........</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  3) I find it interesting that EGW acknowledges that we will be judged</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by our works.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Through selective quoting of EGW you can prove any position from legalism</i><br>
<i>&gt;to antinomianism.  Can you give me a page reference so I can check the</i><br>
<i>&gt;specific reference you refer to?  A judgment by works is indeed referred</i><br>
<i>&gt;to in EGW and the Bible but no one would pass that judgement save for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the grace and forgiveness of Christ.</i><br>
<p>
  Yup, and by selective quoting you can 'prove' that the Book of Mormon<br>
teaches polygny is a sin :).<br>
<p>
  I, and my church, agree that without Christ our good works are for<br>
naught.  And I and my church agree with EGW (or, in chronological order,<br>
EGW agrees with my church and I agree with them) that faith without<br>
works is dead.<br>
<p>
  Here are some snipets from Steps to Christ (1981 addition, interesting<br>
note, in the forward by the 'trustees of the EGW publications' she is<br>
listed as a 'religious speaker and writer');<br>
<p>
page 21, last full paragraph;<br>
  "Oh, let us comtemplate the amazing sacrifice that has been made for<br>
us!  Let us try to appreciate the labor and energy that Heaven is<br>
expending to recalaim the lost, and bring them back to the Father's<br>
house.  Motives stronger, and agencies more powerful, could never be<br>
brought into operation; the exceeding rewards to right-doing, the<br>
enjoyment of heaven, the society of the angels, the communion and love<br>
of God and His Son, the elevation and extension of all our powers<br>
throughout eternal ages--are these not mighty incentives and<br>
encouragements to urge us to give the heart's loving service to our<br>
Creator and Redeemer?"<br>
<p>
pg 60, first full paragraph, and then pg 61 second paragraph;<br>
  "The opposite and no less dangerous error is that belief in Christ<br>
releases men from keeping the law of God; that since by faith alone we<br>
become partakers of the grace of Christ, our works have nothing to do<br>
with our redemption."<br>
<p>
  "That so-called faith in Christ which professes to release men from<br>
the obligation of obedience to God, is not faith, but presumption.  'By<br>
grace are ye saved through faith.' But 'faith, if it hath not works, is<br>
dead.'"<br>
<p>
pg 80, last part of second paragraph on over to pg 81;<br>
  "Those who thus devote themselves to unselfish effort for the good of<br>
others are most surely working out their own salvation.<br>
<p>
  The only way to grow in grace is to be disinterestedly doing the very<br>
work which Christ has enjoined upon us--to engage, to the extent of our<br>
ability, in helping and blessing those who need the help we can give<br>
them.  Strength comes by exercise;<br>
<p>
  ...........  Some not typed, I am getting tired ..........<br>
<p>
  Thus the Christian who will not exercise his God-given powers not only<br>
fails to grow up into Christ, but he loses the strength that he already<br>
had."<br>
<p>
pg 122, part of second full paragraph;<br>
  "Do all you can on your part to bring about favorable results.  Jesus<br>
has promised His aid, but not apart from our effort.  When, relying upon<br>
our Helper, you have done all you can, accept the result cheerfully."<br>
<p>
  Well, did I get it out of context?<br>
<p>
  Thanks for the books R!<br>

  My wife and I (say hello Linda, HELLO LINDA) would appreciate a simple<br>
bio on EGW.<br>
<p>
  What did she do with her life before the SDA church?  What role did<br>
she have in starting the church?  What did she do after the church was<br>
formed?  Did she have a husband and children?  What did she claim of<br>
herself and what have others claimed for her since?  When was she born<br>
and when did she die?  Where did she live before and during the church?<br>
<p>
  Also, how about a simple bio of the SDA church?  From what religions<br>
did the founders come from?  Why did they leave where they were to start<br>
another church?  Where was the church started and when?<br>
<p>
  Thanks, nite all.<br>

Continuing positivity month here on SDAnet:<br>
<p>
Jesus died for you, and for everyone!<br>
He rose again!<br>
He's coming back!<br>
<p>
I saw a variety of different church services this weekend, including a very<br>
powerful drama called "The Choice"<br>
I came to the conclusion that it doesn't hurt one bit to experience some <br>
emotion about Jesus.  They don't call it the Passion play for nothing.<br>
People of that day didn't really understand Christ's mission, and I don't<br>
think that we can claim that we are any better than them.<br>
<p>
The death and resurrection of Christ is not something that can be experienced<br>
only with the head.  It must also be known through the heart and through the <br>
emotions.  I understand it slightly more because I have cried with those <br>
who watched him die, I have cheered at His victory over the grave and <br>
sin and death.  Lord, help us so that our emotions will never become <br>
de-sensitized to this story.<br>

<i>&gt;Subject: Home schooling and the Moores</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have not read Dr. Moore's book on home schooling, so I am out of step in </i><br>
<i>&gt;questioning the utility of his work.  I retract my statement.</i><br>
<p>
I thank you for doing this.  My wife and I are home schooling our two <br>
pre-schoolers.  We examined the various home school offerings and found<br>
the Moores to follow closer to the Spirit of Prophecy recommendations<br>
than anyone else.<br>
<p>
I do hope that this network can avoid character assassination because of<br>
what someone has heard or thought they have heard.  There is enough of <br>
this going on in the church and outside the church.  We do not, as good<br>
disciples of Christ, follow in the world's footsteps.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If there is any problem with home schooling, it's more likely in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;implementation of techniques rather than in home schooling itself. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Some of the kindest,skilled, and well-rounded friends I have were home</i><br>
<i>&gt;schooled at young ages.  I have seen families brought into the church</i><br>
<i>&gt;as a result of contacts our church has with home schoolers.</i><br>
<p>
It really does depend a lot on the curriculum offered and the dedication of<br>
the parents.  If the dedication is not there, the absolute willingness to<br>
devote the time to your children, DO NOT HOME SCHOOL.  This is a sacrifice of<br>
time and effort for both parents.  It means actually coming to know and<br>
experience your children's lives.  This is not easy with most of our<br>
upbringing today.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By the same token, I have seen churches split over the the issue of home</i><br>
<i>&gt;schooling, and I have seen children emotionally scarred for life by such</i><br>
<i>&gt;experiences.  The problem exists in that there is a certain class</i><br>
<i>&gt;of emotionally misadjusted parents who are more likely to home school </i><br>
<i>&gt;their children when the best thing for the kid would be to get away </i><br>
<i>&gt;from the house.</i><br>
<p>
While you may have seen a few who are emotionally scarred, I would daresay<br>
that quite often our own schools don't do much better.  While the problem<br>
exists of certain parents who should not home-school, it really is a question<br>
of parenting and our desire to control.  I could also talk about teachers<br>
who could very easily leave scars on students.  Branding them "trouble-makers"<br>
or teaching them with such a STRICT discipline that they believe all people<br>
are like this.<br>
<p>
It is easy to talk about the exceptions.  Especially without the numbers or<br>
personal experience (not saying you don't have it Steve, just making note..:)<br>
with either type of schooling.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(The same category applies to some parents who choose to start their </i><br>
<i>&gt;children late to school.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Steve Timm</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(To be fair, we have to say that Jesus himself was home-schooled.  SCT]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes, we actually do.  Quite a few of our leaders in this country were home<br>
or self schooled.  :-)<br>

In quick response to Scott's questions:<br>
Ellen White born as Ellen Harmon 1827, Portland, Maine,  died 1915<br>
Married James White, 1845.  Had four sons, two died in childhood.<br>
Shortly after "Great Disappointment" of Millerites in 1844, she <br>
received her first vision.  <br>
<p>
A small portion of Millerites believed that the sanctuary of Daniel 8:14<br>
that was to be cleansed was not this earth, but the heavenly sanctuary.<br>
This group met across New England for a series of Bible conferences in the <br>
next few years, forming the core set of beliefs which form Adventism today.<br>
The doctrines were discovered through hard Bible study, and then often Ellen<br>
would be shown a vision confirming the truth <br>
They came to realize that the door of mercy was not closed to those who <br>
had not believed in 1844, and started publishing a missionary paper.<br>
In the mid-1850's they moved west to Battle Creek, Michigan, and opened <br>
a new press.  The name "Seventh-day Adventists" was chosen in 1860,<br>
and the General Conference was organized in 1863.<br>
<p>
Ellen White's background was as a Methodist, as was John Byington, first<br>
church president.  James White had been a preacher in the Christian<br>
Connection before he became involved in the Millerite movement.<br>
During the Millerite movement many of them were disfellowshipped from the <br>
mainstream denominations which rejected it, and others left voluntarily.<br>
<p>
After the organization of the church, Ellen White's vision turned to <br>
giving guidance for the growing church in matters of publishing, health<br>
reform, and education.  Her husband died in 1881, after which she traveled<br>
to Europe and Australia in missionary work, working all the time on her <br>
writings.  Her later works focus more on devotional topics and the life of <br>
Christ, and the theme of the controversy between Christ and Satan.<br>
<p>
As to what Ellen White claimed for herself, and what others claimed for her,<br>
that's a discussion we have never had directly on SDAnet but probably should.<br>
I'll say more on that in another post.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Subject: Home schooling and the Moores</i><br>
<p>
We're home-schooling our three.<br>
<p>
While the Moore's have contributed to the design of our<br>
curriculum, and our approach, they are only one of<br>
several sources that we have chosen.<br>
<p>
With the differences in character and personality of<br>
each of our kids, I don't think that any single source<br>
would be a best fit for all children.<br>
<p>
As another poster said; if you're not ready and willing<br>
and able to put in a lot of time and effort, home schooling<br>
probably isn't the way to go.<br>
<p>
But if you can, it can be very rewarding.  I'd have to say that<br>
my wife and children are my very best friends.  The idea that<br>
they'll all to soon be heading off to (probably) academy and<br>
(almost certainly) college is not necessarily good news to all<br>
of us.  (Although I have a lot less trouble with the notion than<br>
does my wife...academy was good for me, she never went, joing the<br>
church about the time she entered college.)<br>

We did home schooling one year.  Should give my wife credit for carrying<br>
the brunt of it.  She was not completely satisfied with what any single<br>
home school program offered.  So, she gleaned text books and ideas from<br>
all of them.  She has no formal teacher training.  Yet, where our boys<br>
had been mediocre before, they returned to school the following year<br>
to quickly find themselves at the top of their respective classes.  And<br>
to top that there was some serious consideration of having them skip<br>
a grade as they were running circles around their peers.  PS, our<br>
neighbor was the principle of the local public school.  It was soon<br>
enough obvious we were home schooling.  No problems from him.  But we<br>
did have a retired pastor who objected vigorously.  He claimed EGW<br>
basis for his objections (bogus).  I think his un-announced agenda was<br>
that it resulted in less support for the church's elementary school.<br>
We were being less than loyal to one of the church's programs.<br>
<p>
On the radio I heard of a case where the local public school objected<br>
to a certain girl being home schooled.  I think she was in the 4th<br>
grade.  The public school insisted on testing her, threatening that<br>
if she was deficient in any areas, she would have to go to public<br>
school.  After the testing they insisted she was performing at the<br>
6th grade level and that the family would have to send their daughter<br>
to public school so she could be put on an acceleration program to get<br>
her to the 6th grade, instead of leaving her to languish at the 4th<br>
grade level.  Fortunately the public school lost the argument.<br>
<p>
Another family home schooled their children through 12th grade, sending<br>
them to college "to get accreditation for what they had learned".  The<br>
biggest problem each of them had in college was that it was way too<br>
easy and not enough of a challenge.  All too often I hear of students<br>
who did very well in high school who come close to flunking out when<br>
the find college too tough for them.<br>
<p>
My experience -- when parents take home schooling<br>
seriously, their children benefit over what they would have in school.<br>
And of course there are horror stories of negligent parents and<br>
probably of over bearing dictatorial autocrats.<br>
<p>
One author of a home schooling book being interviewed on the radio<br>
as I was driving along said that teachers in public have such an<br>
overhead of large classes and volumes of busywork paper work that there<br>
is no way that even the best of teachers can do an adequate job.  They<br>
are simply too bogged down in administrivia to be able to really<br>
attend to their students.  Hence, the chances that a parent(s) can<br>
outperform even the best of elementary school teachers is really<br>
very good.<br>
<p>
If you have the time and energy to do home schooling, I highly recommend<br>
it.<br>

death because the entire thing is clearly metaphorical. These are my reasons :<br>
<p>
<p>
This is one of a series of parables: Mustard seed, leaven (Luke 13). <br>
Great supper,<br>
salt with no savor, (Luke 14). Lost sheep, piece of silver, prodigal son<br>
(Luke 15) Unjust stewart, rich man an Lazarus (Luke 16)<br>
<p>
It can not be a literal description of the condition of man after<br>
death because :<br>
<p>
        "Abraham's bosom" is figurative, not literal.<br>
        "One drop of water" is not enough to cool man in hell.<br>
        "People talk back and forth - heaven and hell are not so near.<br>
        Sinners are not punished until the day of judgment :<br>
<p>
<p>
2 Pet 2:9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to<br>
          reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: (KJV)<br>
<p>
The righteous are not rewarded until the resurrection at the <br>
second coming of Christ:<br>
        <br>
John 5:28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that<br>
          are in the graves shall hear his voice, (KJV)<br>
John 5:29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the<br>
          resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the<br>
          resurrection of damnation. (KJV)<br>
Rev 22:12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every<br>
          man according as his work shall be. (KJV)<br>
<p>
 The dead are not conscious :<br>
<p>
Ps 146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there<br>
         is no help. (KJV)<br>
Ps 146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day<br>
         his thoughts perish. (KJV)<br>
<p>
Ecc 9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any<br>
        thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is<br>
        forgotten. (KJV)<br>
Ecc 9:6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;<br>
        neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is<br>
        done under the sun. (KJV)<br>
Ecc 9:10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is<br>
         no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither<br>
         thou goest. (KJV)<br>
<p>
The teaching of the parable is that in this life we settle our eternal destiny<br>
AFter death, the great gulf is fixed. No man is valued merely for his <br>
possessions.<br>
<p>
So If you wish to accept that this parable actually teaches us regarding the<br>
state of the dead you must also accept that each one of those 4 figurative<br>
statements I presented at the beginning to be also literally true. This<br>
can not be because hold them to be true violates various clear teachings<br>
with regard to the reward of the righteous.<br>
<p>
I don't know if you are aware Eric but many of the reformers did not <br>
believe in a consious state after death. For example we have <br>
<p>
<p>
William Tyndale (1484-1536), English Bible translator and Martyr.<br>
John Frith (1503-33), associate of Tyndale and fellow martyr.<br>
Martin Luther (1493-1546) German reformer and Bible Translator.<br>
George Wishart (1500-1546), Greek scholar, friend of Latimer, tutor of<br>
		John Knox, and martyr.<br>
Samuel Richardson (1633-1658) pastor, First Particular Baptist Church<br>
		of London<br>
John Milton (1608-1674), "Greatest of the Sacred Poets"; <br>
<p>
just to name a few.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      but would Jesus use an untruthful example to teach ?  Also, Paul states</i><br>
<p>
Well does, the parable of the 10 virgins teach us that polygamy is acceptable ?<br>
I believe that Jesus method was similar in both these occasions He used<br>
examples which the people could identify with at the time and used them<br>
not as being central to the teaching but as an aid, the parable about the <br>
10 virgins teaches us nothing about marrige but it does teach us about<br>
the Lords coming. The concept of consiousness after death was a very commonly<br>
accepted idea at the time, thanks to the Hellenistic influences at work<br>
at the time in Israel, Hellenism or Greek paganism holds as a central tennet<br>
the immortality of the soul.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      that to be absent from the body is to be with the Lord.  Do you not get</i><br>
<i>&gt;      a sense that Paul considers his body like a "shell"?  </i><br>
<p>
I believe this refers to Pauls experience when He was "out of his body" and<br>
in the third heaven in vision with God seeing and hearing things unlawful for<br>
a man to utter. A bit like when John the Revelator was taken in vision<br>
to heaven, his body remained here but he was not in his body he was in heaven<br>
being shown the mysteries of God. For both of these men these out of body<br>
experiences occured during there lives, not after their deaths. <br>
<p>
The concept of the body being a only shell comes from Greek Paganism, and <br>
Plato, which taught this concept very clearly and not from the bible.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have also spent</i><br>
<i>&gt;      time discussing the Luke 23:43 passage with the Jehovah's Witnesses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      The difference is the placement of the comma, of which I believe in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      original Greek was not present.  If the comma is before the word today</i><br>
<i>&gt;      than, Jesus is telling the thief that even though he is about to die,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      the thief will see Jesus that day in a much better place called paradise.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      On the other hand, if you place the comma "after" the word "today", it</i><br>
<i>&gt;      means that Jesus is emphasizing His point by stating that he is telling</i><br>
<i>&gt;      the thief on that day.</i><br>
<p>
Well the problem that arrises with this interpretation (there is no punctuation<br>
in Greek) is that then Jesus must have also been in heaven with the theif<br>
however we know for a fact because Jesus told us himself that He was not <br>
to be in heaven but in the tomb for 3 days, after the three days Jesus<br>
himself announced to Mary that He HAD NOT ascended up to His father<br>
( in paradise obviously ) yet and that He was to do so, this day was Sunday.<br>
So Jesus must have been lying to the thief because Jesus was definitively not<br>
in heaven until 3 days after He had promised the thief (according to this<br>
interpretation) that He would be there. So that It cannot be that Jesus<br>
promised the thief that he would be together with Jesus in paradise on the <br>
Friday because he wasn't. Only the other interpretation is viable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          There are many other passages that I believe that could be used to</i><br>
<i>&gt;      argue both sides.....I am certainly open to discuss this with anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;      further......</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
yes, I would be willing to do so however you like, either on SDAnet or via<br>
email if you or Steve think this most appropriate.<br>

All this good news reminds me of something that Jesus said,<br>
<p>
"Woe unto you when men shall speak good things concerning you"<br>
<p>
<p>
I wonder whether/how this applies to us.<br>

Hi Scott, Well, we will probably be with the easter Bunny on Sunday. We<br>
will be celebrating the birthday of one of my granddaughters at her house!<br>
<p>
Tomorrow (Saturday) at our Cambridge church we will be winding up our<br>
50-Day Adventure which actually takes us up to Easter. This year our<br>
subject was on "Being the Kind of Family God Wants Us To Be." We had a<br>
journal for our families that they used during the week. It was really<br>
neat. We discovered the dysfunctions of the family, how it also permeates<br>
into the church and how to overcome them. So tomorrow I will be have my<br>
Easter sermon!!<br>
<p>
BTW one of my soninlaws loaned me a book a few weeks ago. The title is :<br>
"The Subtle power of Spiritual Abuse." Sub-titles : "Recognizing and<br>
Escaping Spiritual manipulation and False Spiritual Authority Within the<br>
Church." The authors are David Johnson &amp; Jeff VanVonderen. It is published<br>
by Bethany House publishers and I would highly recommend it. Very good<br>
sermon material!!<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Paul&gt;&gt;<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Steve writes :<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nancy's mention of Pharisees brings to mind a Jewish tradition I once </i><br>
<i>&gt; heard.  It seems that the Pharisees believed that if one Sabbath was</i><br>
<i>&gt; kept perfectly in Israel, the Messiah would come.  Has anyone else </i><br>
<i>&gt; ever run across this tradition?</i><br>
<p>
Yes I have heard it as well but I can't add any more details about the <br>
tradition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Along the same line, we hear the I.K.I.I.E.G.W.S.* statement "When the </i><br>
<i>&gt; character of Christ is fully reproduced in His people, then He will come </i><br>
<i>&gt; to claim them as his own."  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; *I Know It's In EGW Somewhere</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yep I have read it and many more like it. I can give you an exact reference <br>
to it if you like.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What I have trouble with is the idea that we can control God by our actions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There exist reasons why Christ has chosen not to come.  There exist no </i><br>
<i>&gt; barriers that would stop Him from coming at any second He chose.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Instead of pulling the blame on ourselves for it, or pushing it at others,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we need to view God as the God who is in control and ready to help us</i><br>
<i>&gt; finish the work that needs to be done.</i><br>
<p>
Yes it seems we are trying to work our way to heaven. It really worries me<br>
when I hear statements like "Jesus is waiting for us to do enough missionary<br>
work to convert the whole world and then He will come." Some even say that He <br>
will come in his own good time, when He feels like it.<br>
<p>
However EGW wrote back in the 1890's that Jesus would have already come if<br>
his people had been ready to receive Him and then she wrote that we too<br>
like the Israelites would have to return to wander in the desert some more <br>
years because we had rejected the loud cry message (1888) which was<br>
to prepare us for His coming.<br>
<p>
Jesus is not waiting for us to complete the work of spreading the gospel <br>
because He can finish the works in a matter of weeks, (with the power of<br>
the latter rain)<br>
the problem is that we are not ready to receive Him. God will give us the<br>
loud cry spirit and message when we are prepared to accept it, when we realise <br>
that we too are Laodicean and in need of an experience which we are<br>
too indolent to obtain. When we seek for God with all our hearts, when we cry<br>
for him whom we have pierced as one cries for his only son. When we realise<br>
like Peter that maybe we have been decieving ourselves all along and that it <br>
isn't good enough just to know Christ intellectually but that we must be <br>
prepared to sacrifice all with and for Christ, and when we realise like him <br>
that not matter how saved we feel ourselves to be, that there is yet a deeper <br>
work to be done in our souls, a work of unmasking our true natures and pleading<br>
with God to do a work in our hearts which we are of ourselves unable to do.<br>
And that this must be done or there will never be a Pentecost.<br>
<p>
When we permit God to work in us, to hew us by His Spirit, to cut away sin<br>
from our lives. Then the world will see Christ in you (the hope of Glory) and <br>
"ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take <br>
hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying. We will go with you: for we <br>
have heard that God is with you" Zech 8:23 When we are prepared to accept the <br>
message of the loud cry no matter how unpopular or contrary to our inclinations<br>
then the Lord will work in us and through us, His message will be proclaimed<br>
not through the machinations of man but through the powerful working of His<br>
Spirit and then He will come to claim us as His own.<br>

The question is -- is it works that save us.<br>
<p>
I think Jesus illustrated it well when He spoke of the true vine and<br>
its branches.  Our works can be like apples on an apple tree.  But<br>
who would care to eat a wax apple that has been tied in place upon<br>
the same apple tree.  Or who would care to eat an apple that has<br>
fallen from the apple tree, to lay upon the ground for a week or two.<br>
<p>
We are saved by our works, but clearly it is the apple tree that<br>
deserves all the credit for growing the apples.  And that apple tree is<br>
Christ Jesus who came to save us from our sins.  He can grow apples,<br>
all we can do is sculpture wax into something that looks like an<br>
apple from a distance.<br>

Tried to get some info on the Moores last night.  But the Moores are<br>
out of town for the week and the employee I know has just moved and<br>
nobody has the new phone number.  So I talked to the mother of a<br>
former employee.<br>
<p>
I don't know how long ago, but Hewitt Foundation was established<br>
largely because of the Moores.  Hewitt was the biggest financial<br>
contributor who made it all possible.<br>
<p>
The Moores have been on the board of directors for years but not<br>
necessarily the president in charge.  A few years ago the elected<br>
president steered a course that the Moores could not go along with<br>
and so resigned.  The Moore Foundation was founded about two or<br>
three years ago.  Phone 206-635-2736<br>
<p>
Hewitt Foundation is more of a correspondance course curricula with<br>
teachers who grade papers.  They also support home schooling.<br>
<p>
The Moore Foundation offers no correspondance school support.  The<br>
sell books and materials.  They have "counselors" in home schooling<br>
but offer NO "teachers" ready and willing to grade papers and serve<br>
up grades and graduation certificates.  It is a much parent oriented<br>
program as opposed to teacher orriented.<br>
<p>
The life blood of Hewitt was the Moores.  Hence Wewitt is drying up<br>
and may soon have to close.  Moore Foundation is growing.<br>

      Quick note to Paul, Paul..that book about False Authority sounds<br>
      very good.  Is the author an Adventist?<br>
 <br>
      To Rueben,<br>
 <br>
           One thing that I feel I need to express is this.  This issue<br>
       about Soul-Sleep vs the Soul/Spirit survivng death is not a major<br>
       issue for me.  There could in fact be some in our church who may<br>
       hold to the Soul/Sleep position but I'm not sure.  I guess what I'm<br>
       saying is this: It is not a make or break issue for someone's<br>
       salvation.  As for me, I'm not exaclty sure, which in some sense<br>
       gives me a bit more freedom to examine it with as much objectivity<br>
       as I can muster.  I don't necessarily feel any inclination to prove<br>
       either side, but simply desire to examine the Biblical evidence and<br>
       perhaps come to a conclusion.  I also need to express a slight<br>
       frustration I have.  Many times i have discussed the doctrine of the<br>
       Trinity with the JWs.  They  frequently state that the idea of a<br>
       "Trinity" comes from pagen influence and can not be found in the<br>
       Bible anywhere.  I believe they are guilty of arguing their point<br>
       without being honest to the Scriptures.  The Trinitarian doctrine was<br>
       pounded out for centuries by men committed to the Scriptures. They<br>
       didn't use any of Plato's material...just the Biblical evidence.  I<br>
       kind of feel the same about this issue.  I'm more than willing to<br>
       take an "honest" look at the Biblical evidence.  Dig into the Hebrew<br>
       and Greek meanings of words and compare Scripture with Scripture.<br>
       Perhaps I will be convinced, that at death, the entire person ceases<br>
       to exist until the Resurrection.  But to state that there is "no"<br>
       Biblical passages that "seem" to support the position, that the person<br>
       experiences consciousness after death, is not being truly honest to the<br>
       Scriptures.  If you tell me that after much prayerful study, you have<br>
       concluded that the Soul/sleep position is correct, I think thats fine.<br>
       But there are many passages that also lean towards the other position.<br>
       What about Revelation 6:9<br>
           And when He broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the alter<br>
           the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of<br>
           God, and because of the testimony which they maintained.<br>
                                                NASB<br>
 <br>
       Thanks for your response Rueben<br>
 <br>
       Eric<br>

<i>&gt;Well Eric I don't believe that the Parable of rich man and Lazarus</i><br>
<i>&gt;contributes anything at all to our understanding about what happens at</i><br>
<i>&gt;death because the entire thing is clearly metaphorical. These are my reasons :</i><br>
<p>
  Could someone explain to me why this parable is metaphorical?  All the<br>
other parables of Jesus seem to use real life things that people know<br>
happen or that are.  Why isn't this parable the same?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;      but would Jesus use an untruthful example to teach ?  Also, Paul states</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well does, the parable of the 10 virgins teach us that polygamy is acceptable ?</i><br>
  What has polygny to do with that parable?  And no this parable doesn't<br>
teach that, but there are other OT references that teach that for some<br>
men in some times polygyny was from God.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;      than, Jesus is telling the thief that even though he is about to die,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;      the thief will see Jesus that day in a much better place called</i><br>
<i>&gt;paradise.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;      On the other hand, if you place the comma "after" the word "today", it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;      means that Jesus is emphasizing His point by stating that he is telling</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;      the thief on that day.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;in Greek) is that then Jesus must have also been in heaven with the theif</i><br>
<i>&gt;however we know for a fact because Jesus told us himself that He was not</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be in heaven but in the tomb for 3 days, after the three days Jesus</i><br>
<i>&gt;himself announced to Mary that He HAD NOT ascended up to His father</i><br>
<i>&gt;( in paradise obviously ) yet and that He was to do so, this day was Sunday.</i><br>
<i>&gt;So Jesus must have been lying to the thief because Jesus was definitively not</i><br>
<i>&gt;in heaven until 3 days after He had promised the thief (according to this</i><br>
<i>&gt;interpretation) that He would be there. So that It cannot be that Jesus</i><br>
<i>&gt;promised the thief that he would be together with Jesus in paradise on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Friday because he wasn't. Only the other interpretation is viable.</i><br>
<p>
  Excuse me, but I don't wanna (as opposed to can't) control myself<br>
here:<br>
<p>
  Why is it that Jesus, on some occasions only, talks so funny?  Was he<br>
delirous when he said, in effect, 'look today, that is, I am telling you<br>
this today and not yesterday or tomorrow, that you will be with me in<br>
heaven'?  And why, if he meant heaven, didn't he utter the word heaven<br>
instead of another hardly ever used word?<br>
<p>
  I mean, other than the reason that if he said what he meant (paradise<br>
today after we die and me in heaven after 3 days and nites) then there<br>
is a place that our spirits go after death and before heaven (after the<br>
judgement)?<br>

Sorry Dave, I beg to disagree.  Your illustrations are excellent but we<br>
are not saved by our works.  Our works demonstrate our appreciation for<br>
being saved.  The thief on the cross had no works - only faith.<br>
<p>
When we take the attitude that we are saved by our works, we will for sure<br>
have lots of questions for Jesus when we get to heaven in terms of some who<br>
have been saved and some who have not been saved.  I think it's up to Him<br>
who gets saved or not.<br>

<i>&gt; Why is it that Jesus, on some occasions only, talks so funny?  Was he</i><br>
<i>&gt; delirous when he said, in effect, 'look today, that is, I am telling you</i><br>

<i>&gt; instead of another hardly ever used word?</i><br>
<p>
Scott, no one is saying that Jesus was talking funny.  What was put forward<br>
is the idea that in translating the Gospel from the original (punctuationless)<br>
Greek, a comma was placed, perhaps incorrectly.<br>
<p>
Jesus' words were "...assuredly I say to you this day you will be with me in <br>
Heaven".  <br>
<p>
Our Bibles have it punctuated as, "...assuredly I say to you, this day you will <br>
be with me in Heaven,"  which would mean that Jesus was telling the thief that<br>
on that day, He and the thief would both be in Heaven.  Numerous Scripture<br>
quotations recently sent out on this list indicate that death is like sleep and<br>
that -no one- ascends to Heaven until the day He returns for us.  Also, as was<br>
also stated, if the comma is placed that way, Jesus would have lied to the thief,<br>
as He assuredly -didn't- ascend to heaven for several days after His death.<br>
<p>
If the punctuation was set up this way, however, "...assuredly I say to you this <br>
day, you will be with me in Heaven," He would be saying this in today's english:<br>
<p>
"...believe me, because I'm telling you now, you'll be with me in Heaven." <br>
<p>
A pretty simple statement, if you ask me...<br>

Hi Eric,<br>
<p>
You raised the question of the Trinity relative to your dialog with JWs.<br>
They insist this doctrine comes only from paganism and is not Biblical.<br>
<p>
When the pioneers of the SDA church were researching and establishing<br>
the doctrines of the church they were especially cautious of theology<br>
that came into prominence in the early hundreds because that is a period<br>
of church history when many pagan practices were popularized into the<br>
Roman Catholic Church.  At the time of Jesus and the Apostles, Imperial<br>
Rome had its seat of office in the city of Rome.  But this was later<br>
moved to another city and the rule of Rome was handed over to the<br>
church.  Suddenly it became expedient to be a Christian if you had any<br>
political ambitions and hence a large influx of pagans into the<br>
Christianity of Rome and its church politics.  And so much melting<br>
together of pagan and Christian belief and practice into a mixture<br>
that was claimed to be Christian.<br>
<p>
The Protestant Reformation cast off many of the more blatant practices<br>
and beliefs.  But Luther, for example, held back the pace of the<br>
Reformation, being concerned that too much change too quickly and the<br>
peasant folks would simply not keep up and perhaps fall back into the<br>
clutches of Romanism.  Luther, at least for a time, saw the Reformation<br>
as progressing on and on with its reforms into the future.  But what<br>
happened all too often was the development of each religion around the<br>
established theology of a particular reformer followed by the<br>
liberalising of that system of theology over the years.  All too often<br>
the work of a reformer was the high water mark for that particular<br>
church.  Lutherans, for example, still subscribe to infant baptism.<br>
<p>
Another example, Luther taught "soul sleep", as did most reformers.  But<br>
the Annabaptists were pressing for reforms that went beyond what Luther<br>
and others were ready for.  The Annabaptists, for example insisting<br>
that infant baptism meant nothing; that proper adult baptism was called<br>
for.  The Annabaptists became a thorn in the side of the Reformation<br>
churches which by then were becoming state churches.  There was a need<br>
for unity against the Annabaptists.  And so it was decided that<br>
"soul sleep" was a doctrine that could be left to rest in peace for a<br>
time as that was a strong doctrine of the Annabaptists.  Luther and<br>
others did not reject "soul sleep", they simply fell silent on the<br>
subject, allowing Calvin to wax eloquent.<br>
<p>
Anyway, back to the early SDA church.  It was clear that the Protestant<br>
reformation had not reformed all the paganism that had entered the<br>
early church.  And so they were especially cautious of any doctrine<br>
whose history was associated with those early years of pagan influx.<br>
The doctrine of the Trinity was one that had to be very closely<br>
and carefully examined.  Their finding was that the Trinity is clearly a<br>
Biblical doctrine and so it came to be accepted with enthusiasm.<br>

[Scott, asking about Luke 16]<br>
<i>&gt;   Could someone explain to me why this parable is metaphorical?  All the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other parables of Jesus seem to use real life things that people know</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen or that are.  Why isn't this parable the same?</i><br>
<p>
The Catholic Encyclopedia:<br>
<p>
     "LAZARUS<br>
<p>
     "Name of two men in the NT.  The Greek form of the  name,  &lt;greek&gt;,  is<br>
     based  on  an  abbreviated  form  of  the  Hebrew  name elazar (God has<br>
     helped).<br>
<p>
     "Lazarus of Bethany. He . . . . . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
     "Lazarus the Poor Man.  In one of His parables (Lk 16:19-31) Jesus gave<br>
     the  name  Lazarus  to  the  man who lay sick and miserable at the rich<br>
     man's gate, longing in vain for "the crumbs that  fell  from  the  rich<br>
     man's  table";  when  both  men  died,  Lazarus  was borne by angels to<br>
     *Abraham's bosom, to dine at the messianic banquet table, but the  rich<br>
     man  went to torments in *Hades. This is the only NT parable in which a<br>
     character is given a name.  Perhaps Jesus did  so  here  to  show  that<br>
     Lazarus  put  his trust in God's help, as the name signifies.  The rich<br>
     man is popularly called Dives, which is merely the Latin word for "rich<br>
     man."   He  is  called Neus (Ninive?) in the early MS P, and Phinees in<br>
     the Sahidic (Coptic) version, Despite the use of  a  personal  name  in<br>
     this parable, the characters in it were obviously not historical.  How-<br>
     ever, in the Middle Ages  the  poor  man  of  the  parable  became  St.<br>
     Lazarus, the patron of beggars and lepers (Known also as lazars)."<br>
<p>
Notice the statement: "Despite the use of a personal name in  this  parable,<br>
the  characters  in  it were obviously not historical."  In other words, the<br>
name Lazarus is considered to be  symbolic  by  the  Catholic  Encyclopedia.<br>
Note  also  that  they  did  not  apply this parable to hell as I would have<br>
expected.<br>
<p>
Here is what I found in the Interpreters Bible which claims 146 editors  and<br>
consulting editors.  To save you time I'll just glean a few highlights:<br>
<p>
     Two distinct themes - reversal of values in life to come and poor  will<br>
     be rewarded and the rich punished.<br>
<p>
     "19-31. Parable of the Rich Man and the Beggar -- (See also . . . .  .)<br>
     This story was the spark that touched off the revolution in the life of<br>
     Albert Schweitzer.  He concluded that Africa  was  a  beggar  lying  at<br>
     Europe's  doorstep,  so he founded the Lambarene Hospital.  The parable<br>
     has that kind of power. . . . . . . .<br>
<p>
<p>
     "This parable is not theology.  It is a vivid story, not  a  Baedeker's<br>
     guide  to  the next world.  Such stories as this were current in Jesus'<br>
     day.  They are found in rabbinical sources, and even in Egyptian papyri<br>
     (see  Exeg.).  The  climate of the story is almost that of the play The<br>
     Green Pastures. But we cannot be casual with it, for  its  symbols  are<br>
     the  shadows  of realities.  It tells us that inequalities on earth are<br>
     redressed in heaven: lowliness (Lazarus means "God helps") is  rewarded<br>
     hereafter, and self- indulgent pride is rebuked.  We all see that self-<br>
     ishness makes hell on earth: why should we doubt that  it  brings  hell<br>
     hereafter?   The  story  tells  us of a great gulf.  If a man chooses a<br>
     cheap heaven here, he can hardly expect to have a  real  heaven  beyond<br>
     death, for he has lost both taste and aptitude for a real heaven.  If a<br>
     man lives without compassion, he manifestly digs a chasm  between  him-<br>
     self  and  his  fellow  men; and by the same token he separates himself<br>
     from God, for God is love.  The story tells us that life here  fashions<br>
     an eternal destiny."<br>
<p>
Again we see an objective encyclopedia making it clear that this is  a  sym-<br>
bolic parable.<br>
<p>
And now for the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia:<br>
<p>
     "A man in a parable Jesus told (Lk. 16:19-31) to  teach  that  people's<br>
     conduct  on  this  side  of the grave determines their situations after<br>
     death. This parable follows a  story  common  in  Egyptian  and  Jewish<br>
     thought,  in  which the wicked rich and the pious poor have their posi-<br>
     tions reversed in the afterlife.  It is told from the point of view  of<br>
     the  rich  man  (often called Dives from the Latin for "rich man"), who<br>
     speaks with Abraham from his place of torment."<br>
<p>
It should now be clear that the parable was dealing with  monetary  steward-<br>
ship  and stewardship of the form that Albert Schweitzer took to heart. <br>

[Email reporting this to be a Morris Vendon Philosophy]<br>
<i>&gt; An apple doesn't worry about whether or not it's going to produce apples.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It doesn't strain to produce them. The apples are a byproduct of its being </i><br>
<i>&gt; an apple tree (it being hard to grow cherries or kumquats on an apple tree).  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Their quantity and quality are dependent on the condition of the tree.</i><br>

Hi #####,<br>
<p>
I guess I have to take issue with this.  I believe this philosophy is<br>
what shorts out so many Christian batteries and drains off the power<br>
of the Gospel.  I hear people say in various ways -- I guess God has<br>
not decided to give me the victory yet on this matter, in His own good<br>
time He will get around to it.  -- Let us be clear, the power and the<br>
ability and the energy to be victorious comes from Him.  To fear and to<br>
withdraw from a mighty effort against sin in our lives is what so many<br>
Christians are being taught is Christianity.  How many Christians today<br>
would struggle all night for the victory as did Jacob?  In the end he<br>
was given the assurance that he would be safe from Esau.  It was not<br>
his victory, it was God's assurance.  But that came after a night of<br>
struggle and prayer.  Christians today are being taught to put the<br>
car in neutral and to let the breeses blow them where ever they will.<br>
What ever happened to the stout hearted Christianity of our pioneers?<br>

My thoughts on the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus<br>
<p>
Let's suppose for a second that this parable is literally true.<br>
"The beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom."<br>
<p>
This doesn't mean that the beggar went straight to heaven.<br>
<p>
"The rich man died, and was buried.  And in hell he lift up his eyes..."<br>
<p>
Nor does it say that the rich man went to hell immediately<br>
<p>
The communication which happens between Father Abraham and the rich man <br>
is not impossible in hell as we know it, because Abraham stresses <br>
There is a great gulf fixed.<br>
<p>
Finally, nothing says that the rich man doesn't eventually burn up.<br>
<p>
So I think SDA's really have nothing to fear from this parable or a need to <br>
explain it away.<br>
<p>

[Scott included some text which I delete before I send it out  SCT]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Scott, no one is saying that Jesus was talking funny.  What was put forward</i><br>
<i>&gt;is the idea that in translating the Gospel from the original (punctuationless)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Greek, a comma was placed, perhaps incorrectly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jesus' words were "...assuredly I say to you this day you will be with me in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Heaven".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Our Bibles have it punctuated as, "...assuredly I say to you, this day</i><br>
you will<br>
<i>&gt;be with me in Heaven,"  which would mean that Jesus was telling the thief that</i><br>
<i>&gt;on that day, He and the thief would both be in Heaven.  Numerous Scripture</i><br>
<i>&gt;quotations recently sent out on this list indicate that death is like</i><br>
sleep and<br>
<i>&gt;that -no one- ascends to Heaven until the day He returns for us.  Also, as was</i><br>
<i>&gt;also stated, if the comma is placed that way, Jesus would have lied to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;thief,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as He assuredly -didn't- ascend to heaven for several days after His death.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If the punctuation was set up this way, however, "...assuredly I say to you</i><br>
<i>&gt;this</i><br>
<i>&gt;day, you will be with me in Heaven," He would be saying this in today's</i><br>
<i>&gt;english:</i><br>
<p>
  Are there any other instances in the Bible of Jesus qualifying what he<br>
is saying as having been said on the day that he said it?  That is what<br>
sounds so funny to me.<br>

  What does your church say is the fate awaiting all those who died not<br>
knowing of the need for baptism or even that Jesus lived and died for<br>
thier sins?<br>

       When looking at the Luke 23:43 verse, it is true as stated<br>
    before, that in the original Greek, there wasn't the comma.<br>
    I do agree that the passage can make sense with the comma placed<br>
    before or after the word "today".  I also need to say that if I'm<br>
    correct, every current English translation that I've looked at<br>
    ( except for the JWs NWT ) places it before the word today.  That<br>
    list would include the King James, the New King James, the New<br>
    International Version and the New American Standard Version.  I<br>
    am not positive, but I also believe the Revised Standard version<br>
    would also have it before "today".  I realize that the translators<br>
    are only human and are capable of making mistakes, but when it<br>
    seems like the majority of them use the same syntax, it warrants<br>
    us to examine if that might not be the best and most natural way<br>
    to read the text.  The problem occurs if one is trying to prove<br>
    that there is no consciousness immediately after death, then<br>
    there isn't any option, but to state that the comma must be<br>
    placed "after" the word today.  If we try to stand back and just<br>
    read the passage without trying prove or disprove anything, does<br>
    it not tend to lean towards the comma being "before".  Could you<br>
    not imagine the joy the thief had experienced.  Even though he<br>
    had been hanging from the cross in pain,  Jesus assures him that<br>
    by the close of that very day, instead of hanging side by side on<br>
    crosses, he will be with him in a much better place.<br>
 <br>
        Yesterday, I used Revelation 6:9, which states:<br>
 <br>
           And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under<br>
           the alter the souls of them that were slain for the<br>
           word of God, and for the testimony which they held.<br>
                                                KJV<br>
     The word "souls" here in Rev. 6:9 is the Greek word "Psuche"<br>
     According to Dr. Robert Morey in his book "Death and the Afterlife"<br>
     he states that "in the KJV New Testament, "Psuche" is translated<br>
     as "Soul" 59 times, "Life" 39 times, "Mind" 3 times, "Heart" 2<br>
     times, "You" 1 time and "Us" 1 time" (page 55).  In Matthew 10:28<br>
     is another occurrence where "Psuche" is translated "Soul".  It says<br>
 <br>
          And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to<br>
          kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy<br>
          both soul and body in hell.    KJV<br>
 <br>
     Though there are instances in the New Testament, where Soul ind-<br>
     icates simply a person, here are two cases, where it must mean<br>
     the immaterial aspect of a person.  I state this for these reasons:<br>
 <br>
     1.  In both passages, the soul is described as a separate part<br>
         from the body.  In the Matt. 10:28, it states that we should<br>
         not fear them who can kill the "body" but not the "soul".<br>
         Also in the Matt. 10:28, it uses the phrase "both" indicating<br>
         two separate things.<br>
 <br>
     2.  Both passages indicate that it is indeed possible to have<br>
         the body dead, but the soul not.  If you read the following<br>
         passage in Rev ( Rev. 6:10, ) it states that these souls who<br>
         were slain, cry out to the Lord.  They clearly are dead and the<br>
         Ressurrection has not yet occurred....<br>
         Have a good one<br>
         Eric<br>

Hi all with regard to this discussion<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;  I am reading The Great Contraversy and wanted to see if my impressions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;on what EGW is saying are 'correct'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;........... stuff deleted .........</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;  3) I find it interesting that EGW acknowledges that we will be judged</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;by our works.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Through selective quoting of EGW you can prove any position from legalism</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to antinomianism.  Can you give me a page reference so I can check the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;specific reference you refer to?  A judgment by works is indeed referred</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to in EGW and the Bible but no one would pass that judgement save for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the grace and forgiveness of Christ.</i><br>
<p>
I really like the analogy that Dr Ralf Larson uses to illustrate the<br>
difference between works and grace. It goes something like this :<br>
<p>
No one can measure a force directly, we can only measure the amount of <br>
work done by that force. <br>
<p>
For example we can't measure kinetic energy (heat) directly so we need to <br>
measure how high the mercury climbs up the thermometer. This is measuring<br>
the amount of work produced by the force. The mercury does not rise<br>
unless there is heat to push it up.<br>
<p>
We can't measure acceleration directly so we need to measure the amount of<br>
distance travelled (or change in) in a unit of time, this is measuring the <br>
amount of work being performed by the force. Stationary objects do not move <br>
unless there is acceleration to move them.<br>
<p>
We can't measure gravity directly so we need to measure the distance an<br>
object travels (down) on a weigh scale, this is measuring the amount of<br>
work the force performs. The weight scales do not move down unless there<br>
is a gravitational force to push them.<br>
<p>
God's grace is a force that compels each of us, if grace is acting in our<br>
lives then that grace will perform work, that work is manifest in our<br>
actions. We can not measure God's grace directly but we can measure <br>
its presence byt observing the works produced. This is why we are judged<br>
or measured by our works, because they testify that God's saving grace has <br>
been present in our lives. We can not do any real good works <br>
(not talking superficially here) unless God's grace is present within us.<br>
<p>
This is why Jesus said to Nicodemous that the wind (God's grace) goes where<br>
it wants and no one knows where it comes from nor where it goes, we can not<br>
see it but we can hear it. We can hear it because that that is how we measure<br>
wind by hearing the work it does in rustling the leaves.  The same is with<br>
God's grace, we can't see it but for the work it produces. <br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

Eric,<br>
<i>&gt;       perhaps come to a conclusion.  I also need to express a slight</i><br>
<i>&gt;       frustration I have.  Many times i have discussed the doctrine of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Trinity with the JWs.  They  frequently state that the idea of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;       "Trinity" comes from pagen influence and can not be found in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;       Bible anywhere.  I believe they are guilty of arguing their point</i><br>
<i>&gt;       without being honest to the Scriptures.  The Trinitarian doctrine was</i><br>
<i>&gt;       pounded out for centuries by men committed to the Scriptures. They</i><br>
<i>&gt;       didn't use any of Plato's material...just the Biblical evidence.  I</i><br>
<p>
  I think they (JWs) and my church have a problem with the 3 in 1, 1 in<br>
3 concept that some have as their idea of the trinity.  LDS agree that<br>
there is the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, but we believe that the<br>
Bible teaches that they are separate beings.<br>
<p>
  Just a thought.<br>
<p>
  Btw, I was wondering about the same scripture from Rev as you asked<br>
about.<br>

<i>&gt; The question is -- is it works that save us?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think Jesus illustrated it well when He spoke of the true vine and</i><br>
<i>&gt; its branches.  Our works can be like apples on an apple tree.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; who would care to eat a wax apple that has been tied in place upon</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same apple tree.  Or who would care to eat an apple that has</i><br>
<i>&gt; fallen from the apple tree, to lay upon the ground for a week or two.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We are saved by our works, but clearly it is the apple tree that</i><br>
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
Did you really mean this?  We are *judged* by our works ("my reward is<br>
with Me, to give every man according to his works").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; deserves all the credit for growing the apples.  And that apple tree is</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christ Jesus who came to save us from our sins.  He can grow apples,</i><br>
<i>&gt; all we can do is sculpture wax into something that looks like an</i><br>
<i>&gt; apple from a distance.</i><br>
<p>
"By grace are ye saved thru faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the<br>
gift of God."  God's grace is the desire ("both to will") and the power<br>
("and to do His good pleasure") to live a Christ-like life of submission<br>
(the Lord really as Lord) and obedience (the reason why Paul uses the<br>
terms 'slave' and 'servant') to the expressed will of God ("nothing myself<br>
but the will of my Father who sent Me").  Faith is also a gift; it is the<br>
belief that God, even tho we've never met him, is Who He says He is and<br>
what He says in His Word is reliable, trustworthy, effectual, and<br>
incumbent upon us ("All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and<br>
is profitable for ...".  "Do we then make void the Law thru faith?<br>
God forbid; yea, we establish the law." see also Lev 20:7,8).<br>
<p>
Works are the outward demonstration of the inward transformation (new man,<br>
new heart of flesh, i.e., sanctification).  They are the "proof of the<br>
pudding", so to speak.  They bring glory to God because they reveal His<br>
character ("let your light so shine before men that they may see your<br>
good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven", "you are living<br>
epistles, known and read of all men") and demonstrate the man's<br>
character can be changed; that "Christ in you" makes a difference.<br>
We are not saved by our works; yet we cannot be saved without works.<br>
<p>
We make a decision to accept Jesus as our Savior, i.e., that He paid the<br>
penalty for our sins (atonement), that our sins are forgiven (justification),<br>
that we walk in newness of life, and that we have eternal life (IJn5:11-13).<br>
But if things do not progress from there, we're just a bunch of hot air,<br>
we're all flap and no throttle.  Indeed, if there's no growing in grace,<br>
it is because we are rejecting the promptings of the Holy Spirit.<br>

Thanks to Dave Buxton, I just recently became aware of this moderated<br>
distribution list.  As with other such, it is appropriate that I introduce<br>
myself.  I shall do so from several perspectives, several of which are<br>
in case we may have met before.<br>
<p>
Geographic Bio:  Born in Fredericton, NB, in 1953.  Bangalore, India, 56-60.<br>
Madras, India, 60-62.  Andrews U campus, 62-63.  Calcutta, India, 63-66.<br>
Simpsonville, MD, 66-67.  Oshawa, ON, 67-71.  Sarnia, ON, 71-75.  Lukanga,<br>
Zaire, 75-77.  Waterloo, ON, 77-79.  Minneapolis, MN, area 79-82.<br>
Chandler, AZ, 82-88.  Sherwood, OR, 88-91.  Phoenix, AZ, 91-present.<br>
<p>
Educational Bio:  Home schooled grades 1-3,5,6.  Andrews Elementary for 4th.<br>
Vincent Hill School, India, 6th (part) &amp; 7th.  Atholton, MD, Jr Acad 8th.<br>
Kingsway (College) Academy.  Andrews University, BS Math (except for soph<br>
year in Collonges, France, 72-73).  Univ of Waterloo, MMath in Comp Sci.<br>
<p>
Work Bio:  Trans-Africa Div of SDA, Zaire; Honeywell, Minn; Motorola, AZ;<br>
BiiN, OR; Intel, OR; Motorola, AZ.<br>
<p>
Family Bio:  Parents, Grace &amp; Gerhard Christiansen, now in Willowdale, ON.<br>
Sister Linda.  Got married to Kathie Ewald in 1975.  Children are Liesl, 14,<br>
Weimar Academy (home schooled 1-7, half of 9th); Monique, 11, home school;<br>
Andrew, 4; Bonnie, 1.<br>
<p>
Spiritual Bio:  Born a P.K. into an excellent family.  Fond memories of<br>
family worship, singing around the piano, etc.  Determined I would make P.K.<br>
an honorable phrase.  Helps to have had a father who understood that his<br>
witness is badly damaged if his family suffers from neglect.  Baptized<br>
at age 14 (or was it 15?).  Got pretty cocky in college, figured I'd heard<br>
everything, knew all the stories, knew many "proof texts".  The fall came<br>
when I became unwisely engaged.  Rescued from foolishness and calamity by<br>
God's grace and the effectual, fervent prayers of my parents.  Via Glenn<br>
Coon's ABC's of prayer, recognized there was a whole lot more to spirituality.<br>
Other writers, such as Morris Venden, have helped me see the need for growing<br>
relationship with the Lord.  Motivated to seeking Godly wisdom for *every-<br>
thing* in life by attending Bill Gothard's Life Principles Seminars (basic<br>
and advanced) numerous times, and (finally, after all these years) reading<br>
Conflict of the Ages series and Tho'ts from the Mount of BLessing.<br>
<p>
Service Bio:  Teaching in Cradle Roll, Kindergarten, Primary, Juniors,<br>
Youth, and Adult Sabbath School.  Deacon, Waterloo, ON; Elder, Maple Plain, MN,<br>
Tempe, AZ, Gladstone Park, OR.  Preaching, Waterloo, Maple Plain, various<br>
places in AZ.  Organizing deaf ministries, interpreting in AZ and OR.<br>
Has been a source of joy to see those I taught starting like ministry in<br>
Austin, TX, and continuing and growing greatly in Gladstone, OR.<br>
<p>
Spiritual challenges:  Being laid off from Honeywell; BiiN collapsing,<br>
2nd child becoming profoundly deaf at age 6 months.<br>
<p>
"It will be worth it all, when we see Jesus.<br>
 Life's trials will seem so small, when we see Christ.<br>
 One glimpse of His dear face, all sorrow will erase.<br>
 So bravely run the race, 'til we see Christ."<br>

David I will be very disappointed if I find out I am saved by works. The<br>
apple tree grows apples because it is an apple tree not because it desires<br>
to be an apple tree!<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
	I think the problem here is a slight misunderstanding. Dave<br>
can set me straight if I misunderstood him. I think what Dave was saying<br>
is that we are saved by our works in that without works we can not be saved.<br>
<p>
I like to put it by saying that we are not saved by works but without<br>
works we are not saved. The reason is that the salvation experience produces<br>
works if there are no works we obviously have not received the saving grace.<br>
<p>

On Wed, 22 Apr 1992 10:30:05 -0400 (EDT) you said:<br>
<i>&gt;Hi Eric,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;........ most deleted ........</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anyway, back to the early SDA church.  It was clear that the Protestant</i><br>
<i>&gt;reformation had not reformed all the paganism that had entered the</i><br>
<i>&gt;early church.  And so they were especially cautious of any doctrine</i><br>
<i>&gt;whose history was associated with those early years of pagan influx.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The doctrine of the Trinity was one that had to be very closely</i><br>
<i>&gt;and carefully examined.  Their finding was that the Trinity is clearly a</i><br>
<i>&gt;Biblical doctrine and so it came to be accepted with enthusiasm.</i><br>
<p>
  Yes, but, I think what Eric might be asking is what is the SDA concept<br>
of the trinity?  Three distinct individuals with the same desires?<br>
Three manifestations of one being?  Etc?<br>
  As LDS we recognize that there are 3 distinct personages to the<br>
Godhead.  They are one in purpose.  Two have bodies, while the Holy<br>
Ghost does not.  Before I was Lutheran and was taught 3-in-1 (which to<br>
this day I don't quite know what was meant).  If I remember correctly<br>
they taught only Jesus had a body.  To me, now, that means they don't<br>
read the Bible too much.<br>

        I just wanted to add an additional note to the discussion<br>
     regarding Luke 23:43.  The passage in the KJV reads as follows:<br>
 <br>
           "And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,  To day<br>
         shalt thou be with me in paradise."<br>
 <br>
     I have a Strong's concordance of the entire KJV Bible.  I looked<br>
     up the term "verily".  Many times throughout the gospels, Jesus<br>
     uses this phrase "Verily I say unto thee".  Each and every time<br>
     that I looked up, the comma is always after the "thee".  Then after<br>
     the comma, Jesus makes his statement.  The New American Standard<br>
     version uses "Truly" instead of "verily".  This pattern is consist-<br>
     ent for each occurrence that I've looked up.  Below are several<br>
     examples of this.<br>
 <br>
     Matthew 5:26<br>
          Truly I say you, you shall not come out of there, until<br>
          you have paid the last cent.<br>
 <br>
     Matthew 8:10<br>
          Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled, and said to those<br>
          who were following, "Truly I say to you, I have not found<br>
          such great faith with anyone in Isreal."<br>
 <br>
     Luke 4:24<br>
          And He said, "Truly I say to you, no prophet is welcome in<br>
          his home town."<br>
 <br>
       In each of the above passages, the comma is after the phrase<br>
       "Truly I say to you".  Then after the comma, Jesus makes His<br>
       point.  There must be more than 40 occurrences of this phrase<br>
       in the gospels, and using my concordance, I didn't find any<br>
       instances where Jesus used "Truly I say to you today".<br>
       I believe this is a consistant pattern and should be taken<br>
       into account when interpreting Luke 23:43.  If anyone knows of<br>
       any that I overlooked, could you let me know ?<br>
       Eric Snyder<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;Scott, no one is saying that Jesus was talking funny.  What was put forward</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is the idea that in translating the Gospel from the original (punctuationless)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Greek, a comma was placed, perhaps incorrectly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Are there any other instances in the Bible of Jesus qualifying what he</i><br>
<i>&gt;is saying as having been said on the day that he said it?  That is what</i><br>
<i>&gt;sounds so funny to me.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Yes, there are other instances.  Read John 9:1 - 6.  Pay particular attention<br>
to the question in verse 2 and Jesus' answer in verses 3 and 4.  If you are<br>
nor careful with the punctuation, you will think that Jesus is saying that<br>
God made someone blind just so Jesus will have the opportunity to perform a<br>
miracle.  Now place a period after "parents" in verse 3, and start the "but"<br>
with an upper case "B", and you'll notice that Jesus is now implying that the<br>
question is not relevant but He MUST make God's work relevant in this person.<br>
<p>
I hope I been of some help.<br>

<i>&gt; [Email reporting this to be a Morris Vendon Philosophy]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; An apple doesn't worry about whether or not it's going to produce apples.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It doesn't strain to produce them. The apples are a byproduct of its being </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an apple tree (it being hard to grow cherries or kumquats on an apple tree).  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Their quantity and quality are dependent on the condition of the tree.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I guess I have to take issue with this.  I believe this philosophy is</i><br>
<i>&gt; what shorts out so many Christian batteries and drains off the power</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the Gospel.</i><br>
<p>
Nuts.  I see that I didn't get the point clearly across.  You have<br>
missed the point, therefore. Mea culpa.  Did you miss the last line<br>
of the preceding paragraph?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I hear people say in various ways -- I guess God has</i><br>
<i>&gt; not decided to give me the victory yet on this matter, in His own good</i><br>
<i>&gt; time He will get around to it.</i><br>
<p>
This has essentially nothing to do with the apple tree analogy given<br>
above.<br>
<p>
The fruit of the tree is your works.  Your works may be good or bad,<br>
but the fact that there is fruit is no more than a byproduct of mere<br>
existence.  Your works may be of faith, or they may not be of faith.<br>
<p>
The *quality* of the fruit is a reflection of the person's relationship<br>
with Christ.  A useful indicator of your condition (although the said<br>
fruit may be either profitable or damaging to others).  Just because<br>
there's an apple is no reason to be complacent, unless you *like*<br>
worms or hard, sour, dry lumps.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  -- Let us be clear, the power and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ability and the energy to be victorious comes from Him.</i><br>
<p>
Of course.  That's implied in the above analogy.  The tree cannot<br>
live, much less bear fruit, without the sun, soil, and water that<br>
it requires for life.  Those things it receives outside of any<br>
efforts of its own.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Christians today are being taught to put the</i><br>
<i>&gt; car in neutral and to let the breeses blow them where ever they will.</i><br>
<p>
The which, while true, is not supported by Venden's parable.<br>
<p>
Some seem to figure on waiting until they've miraculously received the<br>
victory (over whatever)...this points out that waiting around for it<br>
to drop on your head is not just pointless, it is damaging: the fruit<br>
is being borne all the while.  But it's not good fruit, not profitable<br>
to anyone.<br>
<p>
If nothing else, the notion should give you more impetus to fix the<br>
broken connection, to develop that full, right relationship, before<br>
any more damage is done.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What ever happened to the stout hearted Christianity of our pioneers?</i><br>
<p>
It's still around, as is the limp, soggy failings of them, too.  :{<br>
Something that we have to deal with, just as they had to.<br>
<p>
Sorry about the confusion, it seemed quite clear to me.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
I was talking with a friend who lives in Loma Linda tonight.  He indicated<br>
that the Medical Center is having severe financial troubles.  The cost<br>
overruns on the proton project have been tremendous.  It will take decades<br>
of treatments to pay for it!  They have terminated 600 workers.  Since the<br>
insurance companies have set limits to the amount of money they will pay<br>
for treatments and surgeries, the physicians at LLUMC are refusing to accept<br>
patients whose insurance carriers impose limits to coverage.  The building<br>
of the Childrens Hospital is on indefinite hold.  And the financial stability<br>
of the institution is in serious question.  Can any of you out there<br>
confirm these facts?  Is Loma Linda going to going down in financial flames<br>
rather than the literal flames of Battle Creek?<br>

  At a guess I would say it comes from a fear of the W word (works).<br>

        When I referred to my encounters with the JWs and discussing<br>
     the Trinity, I was only using that as an example of what I believe<br>
     to be an improper technique to argue a point.  The JWs state that<br>
     the idea of the Trinity is foreign to the Bible and that it came<br>
     from pagen sources.  This is not a true statement.  There is "plenty"<br>
     of biblical evidence supporting the Trinity.  I was using that to<br>
     describe some frustration when someone states that the idea of a<br>
     person having a soul/spirit that survives death is completely foreign<br>
     to the Bible and is completely influenced by Greek philosphers.<br>
     I believe that to some point that in some circles, Greek philosophy<br>
     "has" influenced this topic, but at the same time, to be fair, there<br>
     are some committed Christians who hold the "soul/spirit survives<br>
     death" position and they base their conclusions only on the Bible.<br>
 <br>
     As far as the Trinity goes, it is a complex doctrine and to do it<br>
     justice, we would need to take a lot of time, but I believe that<br>
     our church would be in agreement with the SDA position.  I could<br>
     though quickly sum up how I believe many theologians have arrived<br>
     at it.  Both the Old and New Testaments teach that there is one<br>
     and only one true God.  The Jewish faith was/is a "monotheistic"<br>
     faith.  The Christian faith is also a "monotheistic" faith, only<br>
     believing in one God.  Within the New Testament, there are three<br>
     persons who are called God.  The Father is called God ( 2 Peter 1:17),<br>
     Jesus is called God ( John 1:1, 20:28) and the Holy Spirit is<br>
     called God (Acts 5:3,4).  Yet there is only one True God (1 Corinthians<br>
     8:4, John 17:3).  To avoid heresy, you have to walk a fine line.  If<br>
     you deny that Jesus or the Holy Spirit are God, you aren't being<br>
     true to Scripture.  If you say there are 2,3 or many gods, you're<br>
     also not being true to Scripture.  In order to be true to the Scriptures<br>
     you need to maintain that there is only one "True" God, and that three<br>
     persons are referred to as God.  Yes, I know there are instances of<br>
     where people are called "gods" (Psalm 82) and satin is called the god<br>
     of this world, but John 17:3 states that there is only one "true" god.<br>
     We can always discuss this in more depth at a later date.  I hope you<br>
     all have a wonderful weekend and a very pleasant Sabbath.  One thing<br>
     I know, whether the soul survives death or not is one thing,  knowing<br>
     that at sometime in the future, we will be with the King of Kings in<br>
     a place where there are no more tears is quite another.<br>

On Thu, 23 Apr 1992 12:55:57 -0400 (EDT) you said:<br>
<i>&gt;Yes, there are other instances.  Read John 9:1 - 6.  Pay particular attention</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the question in verse 2 and Jesus' answer in verses 3 and 4.  If you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;nor careful with the punctuation, you will think that Jesus is saying that</i><br>
<i>&gt;God made someone blind just so Jesus will have the opportunity to perform a</i><br>
<i>&gt;miracle.  Now place a period after "parents" in verse 3, and start the "but"</i><br>
<i>&gt;with an upper case "B", and you'll notice that Jesus is now implying that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;question is not relevant but He MUST make God's work relevant in this person.</i><br>
<p>
  To make your example complete in my KJV I had to change the period at<br>
the end of v3 into a comma (and didn't really have to make the other<br>
changes).  Since becoming LDS I have interpreted it the same way you<br>
suggest (an irrelivant question because bad things happen to good people<br>
through no fault of their own and that God does not punish person A<br>
because their family are bad people).<br>
<p>
  However, I don't see that this example applies to the question I had<br>
about Jesus stating that what he is saying on that day is in fact being<br>
said on that day.<br>

Here are some more thoughts on the discussion of death as a sleep.<br>
<p>
	When Jesus said, ``Verily I say unto thee today thou shalt be<br>
with me in Paradise,'' the fact that he said it ``today'' is highly<br>
significant.  He is saying, Today, when I am hanging on a cross,<br>
today, when the crowd is mocking me, today, when it seems like all is<br>
lost, today, I am promising you that you will be with me in Paradise.<br>
Jesus knew that that was a very special day, the day on which he was<br>
purchasing the pardon for our sins.<br>
<p>
	The fact that other times that Jesus said ``Verily I say unto<br>
thee'' the comma occurs next, is interesting but not by itself<br>
conclusive.<br>
<p>
	We really need to be careful to take the entire Bible<br>
testimony on each topic.  The reason we have so many churches is that<br>
some people take a few verses here and there and base a doctrine on<br>
it.  Others take a different selection of verses and come to a<br>
different conclusion.  We need to look at the entire Bible testimony<br>
on each topic and make our decision based on that.<br>
<p>
	Instead of focusing on a few verses where it is possible to<br>
interpret them as referring to a heavenly reward at death, we need to<br>
keep in mind many other verses.  For example, in the story of Lazarus,<br>
Jesus said ``Lazarus is sleeping.''  Paul writes in 1 Cor 15 that ``we<br>
shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.''  He also says in<br>
verse 26, the last enemy to be destroyed is death.  Death is an enemy,<br>
not a friend that takes us to heaven.  In 1 Thess 4 Paul comforts the<br>
bereaved that they will see their loved ones when Jesus returns.  How<br>
many funeral sermons do you hear like that today?  Instead, the<br>
minister comforts us that the deceased is in heaven.  Daniel says,<br>
``Many that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake.''  (Daniel<br>
12:2) If you think Jesus spoke funny to the thief on the cross -- what<br>
about what he said about Lazarus sleeping and many other similar Bible<br>
verses?  Wouldn't it be speaking funny in all these places if indeed<br>
there were an immortal soul that went to heaven or hell at death?<br>
<p>
	This doctrine of soul sleep took me a while to convince myself<br>
of when becoming an Adventist.  But I studied for myself and became<br>
convinced that it is most in line with the entire Bible testimony.  I<br>
invite others to do the same.<br>
<p>

My understanding is that the fundamental problem (at least at one level)<br>
is a low census percentage--in the 50s and 60s for the last several months.<br>
This is quite a change from the high 80s and low 90s of a year or so ago, when<br>
most other hospitals in the area were struggling along with low 70s.<br>
The hospital has recently taken three steps in response to this situation:<br>
closing wards so as to change the basis for computing census percentages<br>
so they don't look so bad; terminating employees to bring down the payroll cost<br>
(clearly the larget expense the hospital incurs on a continuing basis); and<br>
placing a very large number of employees on forced one-day-a-week unpaid leave.<br>
<p>
At another level, it seems that the hospital recently hired a consulting<br>
firm to identify the source of the census drop.  The preliminary report was<br>
that a large number of internists (internal medicine specialists, not to be<br>
confused with interns (doctors in training)) had left the hospital's staff<br>
over that past three years--20% or more by some estimates, and that had a<br>
significant impact on patients admitted to the facility.  The was not the<br>
politically correct answer, so a different consulting firm has been<br>
retained.  It is interesting to note that there has not been an exodus of<br>
internists from the Loma Linda housing market; they all seem to have joined<br>
the staffs of a hospital or two down the road a couple of miles...<br>
<p>
<p>
The hospital/medical school have experienced extended dissent among the<br>
internists for several years now--the politically correct approach to this<br>
problem has been to fire the leaders of dissenting parties.  This in turn<br>
has caused further distress/distrust/dissent.<br>
<p>
Significant problems also exist within the faculty side, apart from how the<br>
physicans are "managed" at the hospital; Dr. Behrens leadership style is<br>
under sever attack from several angles.  Even though LLU's WASC<br>
accreditation status has been upgraded from probatinary to a three-year<br>
term, it is readily apparent that all is not well within.<br>
<p>
I don't know to what extent the proton project can be blamed for financial<br>
distress, other than as a part of the financial burden of building two new<br>
wings, one of which (the children's hospital) is a hollow shell above the<br>
proton accelerator.<br>
<p>
One wonders when the board of trustees of LLU/LLUMC will question the<br>
appropriateness of the leadership teams in place there...  for now, it<br>
appears theat they are convinced that no other leaders can save the place.<br>
<p>
This raises an interesting question for this forum:<br>
what is the Christian way (if there is one) of forcibly chaning<br>
leadership?  Give them a call to some other position, and hope they accept<br>
it is divine guidance? and if they don't see it that way?<br>

Hello all,<br>
<p>
Cheryl's farewell address, sad as it was, raised several questions<br>
for me about the SDA church.  I belong to an independent, fundamental,<br>
Bible church and have no connection with SDAs except through this<br>
net list (and my oral hygienist).  I want to raise these questions<br>
on the net without directly discussing Cheryl's actions.  I would<br>
contact her directly as she invited, but I don't feel adequate to<br>
express my thoughts and feelings to her in print.<br>
_________________________________________________<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Cheryl writes</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;was born and raised a 4th-generation Adventist, but ...</i><br>
<p>
The Catholic church considers someone a member of the church<br>
due to being born of Catholic parents.  Do SDAs feel the<br>
same?  Can one be born into the SDA church?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I never really understood and may never totally understand </i><br>
<i>&gt;why I had to suffer so much at the hands of the SDA church.  </i><br>
<p>
Did I miss something in her narrative?  After reading it<br>
through several times, I saw no abuse by the SDA church.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;only way for me to be open to believe in God's true church. </i><br>
<i>&gt;...the LDS church</i><br>
<p>
Does the SDA church consider the LDS church a valid member<br>
of the body of Christ?  For that matter, what do you think<br>
about fundamental, Bible churches?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[I now realize that] I am not a guinea pig down here on </i><br>
<i>&gt;this sinful earth, a victim of the war in heaven.  Rather I </i><br>
<p>
Is this a perception taught by the SDA church?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Cheryl Berthelsen</i><br>
<i>&gt;cberthel@cc.utah.edu</i><br>
<p>
My best regards,<br>
Dan Blake<br>
dblake@hprnd.rose.hp.com<br>
<p>
P.S.  One more question from another posting many moons ago.<br>
Does the SDA church have woman pastors?<br>

[Cheryl, a former SDA, writes]<br>
<i>&gt;On November 14, 1991, I was baptized into The Church of Jesus</i><br>

Romans chapter 2 is a good one to read on this topic.<br>

Those who respond to Jesus, through the Holy Spirit working upon their<br>
conscience are more savable than those who merely say "Lord Lord",<br>
knowing Jesus, but without the power in evidence.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; dblake asked:  The Catholic church considers someone a member of the church</i><br>
due to being born of Catholic parents.  Do SDAs feel the<br>
same?  Can one be born into the SDA church?<br>
<p>
Yes, we can be born into an SDA home and raised on SDA principles, sent to<br>
SDA schools and colleges, and adopt the SDA culture.  However, technically<br>
one is not a member of the SDA church until he/she is formally baptized into<br>
the church.  I was baptized at the age of 10 at my own request. I believed<br>
and practiced the beliefs and doctrines of the SDA remaining a steadfast<br>
member until my 20s.  Then I rejected the church and withdrew from formal<br>
association with the SDA.  I was never formally "disfellowshipped" or<br>
"excommunicated" and was rebaptized into the SDA church in my late 20s<br>
following a severe auto accident that caused me to start thinking about<br>
eternal things.  My rebaptism was my way of identifying myself as a<br>
believing SDA once again.  However, there was no searching for truth or<br>
personal study about the SDA doctrines at that time.  Only a recommitment<br>
to live an SDA life consistent with what I had been taught and known all<br>
my life.<br>

<i>&gt;   At a guess I would say it comes from a fear of the W word (works).</i><br>
<i>&gt; People are being taught that they don't have to do anything to be saved.</i><br>

A non-SDA friend of mine that I see frequently.  He ended up wanting to<br>
talk about tithing.  He said that his not tithing used to bother him<br>
enormously but he thanks God that He has delivered him from that<br>
affliction so that he can now go about with a free conscience over it.<br>
He anticipates that in His own good time God will make the way possible<br>
and show him when and how to go about tithing.  "Its in the Lord's<br>
hands now and so I don't worry about it anymore."<br>
<p>
The Jesus people used to have a saying that goes approximately like<br>
this:  Turn your life over to Jesus, put yourself in neutral and then<br>
go have a good time.<br>
<p>
The "Christian" community out there is getting increasingly aggressive<br>
with "easy believism" theology as my Evangelical friends call it.  And<br>
this philosophy is more and more showing up in our church, even from<br>
the pulpit.  I heard a constant barrage of it at our pot-luck dinner<br>
this last Sabbath.<br>

The only kind of "perseverance of the saints" in which SDAs believe is that<br>
taught by Jesus himself.  Matthew 24:13--"He who endures to the end will be<br>
saved."  Rev 2:10--"Be faithful unto death and I will give you the crown of<br>
life."<br>
<p>
The apostles were aware of the danger of falling.  Peter wrote: "You, there-<br>
fore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, beware lest you be carried away with the error of lawless men and lose your own stability" 2 Pet 3:17.  Paul even<br>
allowed for the possibility of his own fall!  1 Cor 9:27--"I pommel my body and<br>
subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified."<br>
<p>
Having admitted the possibility of falling from grace, we can nevertheless,<br>
with Paul, be sure that "we are more than conquerors through him who loved<br>
us."  Nothing, neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor <br>
things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor<br>
anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of<br>
God in Christ Jesus our Lord" Rom 8:37-39.   Nothing--except our own choice!<br>
We are God's as long as we choose to belong to him.  When we choose other-<br>
wise, we depart from perseverance and fall into condemnation.<br>

It is interresting to note how often Jesus quotes from the Old<br>
Testament.  Consider the following two texts.  The 2nd is what Jesus<br>
said just before he died.  The first is made in a Psalm that really<br>
has nothing to do with death or its immediate anticipation.  And<br>
yet the 2nd is a popular text for "proving" a separable spirit.<br>
<p>
   "Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O LORD God of <br>
   truth."  --  Psa 31:5  (NKJ)<br>
<p>
   "And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, "Father, 'into <br>
   Your hands I commend My spirit.'" And having said this, He breathed His <br>
   last."  --  Luke 23:46  (NKJ) (See Ps 31:1,5)<br>

         I have a question as to how much tolerance the SDA church<br>
    has of its members who might not hold to the soul-sleep position.<br>
 <br>
    What would happen if a good standing member in the SDA church<br>
    expressed some doubt in the soul sleep position ?  Would that<br>
    member possibly be in jeopardy of excommunication ?  Would they<br>
    be considered a heretic or would the church leaders just simply<br>
    reply that he/she was incorrect on this point and that they needed<br>
    to re-study the topic ?  I'm just trying to get a feel of how much<br>
    importance this teaching is in the eyes of the church, and if there<br>
    is any leeway?<br>
<p>
[I've never heard a case where anyone challenged this doctrine.  It's one <br>
of the least-debated doctrines within the church, which is why I'm glad<br>
we're studying it now.  Traditional Bible studies on the topic aren't<br>
answering the<br>
questions people are asking.  I would note that even such "heretics" as <br>
Walter Rea who openly challenged the authority of Ellen White were not<br>
stripped of their church membership.  Disfellowship for disbelieving <br>
doctrine is extremely rare.  SCT]<br>

    Dave Plaisted writes:<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;          Instead of focusing on a few verses where it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;      possible to interpret them as referring to a heavenly</i><br>
<i>&gt;      reward at death, we need to keep in mind many other</i><br>
<i>&gt;      verses.  For example, in the story of Lazarus, Jesus</i><br>
<i>&gt;      said ``Lazarus is sleeping.''</i><br>
 <br>
 <br>
       I have to admit, these passages that mention the verb "sleep"<br>
    when referring to the dead need to be addressed and in my opinion<br>
    are some of the strongest verses for the soul-sleep position.<br>
    The passage that Dave refers to does seem to indicate that death<br>
    is considered "sleep".  However, if we read the entire passage,<br>
    you read in Jesus states in verses 25 and 26:<br>
 <br>
    John 11<br>
    v25   Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he<br>
          who believes in Me shall live even if he dies,<br>
    v26   and everyone who lives and believes in Me shall never die.<br>
          Do you believe this ?"<br>
 <br>
       If you focus on verse 26, Jesus says that the person who lives<br>
    and believes in Him shall "never die".  If, when a believer dies,<br>
    he/she passes into non-existance, how can Jesus say that the person<br>
    has never died ?  Though Lazurus body was indeed dead and in the<br>
    tomb 4 days, the only way to explain that he "never died" would be<br>
    to conclude that though his body expired, his soul/spirit continued<br>
    to live.  Lets compare this thought with some of Paul's writings:<br>
 <br>
    Dave further writes:<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;          Paul writes in 1 Cor 15 that ``we shall not all</i><br>
<i>&gt;      sleep, but we shall all be changed.'' He also says in</i><br>
<i>&gt;      verse 26, the last enemy to be destroyed is death.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Death is an enemy, not a friend that takes us to</i><br>
<i>&gt;      heaven.</i><br>
 <br>
    Dave says that death is an enemy and not a freind, that takes us<br>
    to heaven.   Please compare Dave's statement with philippians 1:21<br>
 <br>
        "For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain."<br>
 <br>
    Paul says that to die is "gain".  Further, in verse 23 Pauls<br>
    states "But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the<br>
    desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much<br>
    better."  Then verse 24 "yet to remain on in the flesh is more<br>
    necessary for your sake."<br>
 <br>
        From the above passage, is there any question that Paul sees<br>
    his death as "gain" so that he can be with Christ ?  In addition,<br>
    Paul speaks of "remaining in the flesh".  Do you not get a sense<br>
    that Paul considers his body, something which "he is in".  Compare<br>
    this with 2 Corinthians 5:8<br>
 <br>
         "we are of good courage, I say and prefer rather to be<br>
       absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord."<br>
 <br>
    The key phrase is "absent from the body".  If at Paul's death,<br>
    he would pass into non-existance, how could he be "absent from<br>
    the body".<br>
 <br>

# <br>
# &gt;   At a guess I would say it comes from a fear of the W word (works).<br>
# &gt; People are being taught that they don't have to do anything to be saved.<br>
# &gt; Just a thought.<br>
# &gt; <br>
# &gt; Scott<br>
# <br>
# A non-SDA friend of mine that I see frequently.  He ended up wanting to<br>
# talk about tithing.  He said that his not tithing used to bother him<br>
# enormously but he thanks God that He has delivered him from that<br>
# affliction so that he can now go about with a free conscience over it.<br>
# He anticipates that in His own good time God will make the way possible<br>
# and show him when and how to go about tithing.  "Its in the Lord's<br>
# hands now and so I don't worry about it anymore."<br>
<p>
And people wonder why they don't see God moving in their lives!!<br>
<p>
My take on tithing is pretty simple.  God owns it all.  Ten percent is<br>
the starting point in my giving.  God has given me a job and an<br>
income.  Every penny belongs to Him.  And I recall that when it comes<br>
time to write the check.<br>
<p>
# The Jesus people used to have a saying that goes approximately like<br>
# this:  Turn your life over to Jesus, put yourself in neutral and then<br>
# go have a good time.<br>
<p>
This succinctly sums up "cheap grace."  I would agree with "Turn your<br>
life over to Jesus."  However, I have yet to find works involved with<br>
salvation.  That is, you cannot work and earn salvation.  However, I<br>
do believe that once you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and<br>
Saviour, you will do the works of faith.  If someone says that they<br>
are a Christian but have no works, I think they need to take another<br>
look at their life.  If works are involved in salavation, then it<br>
could be argued that one person worked harder than another and thereby<br>
earns more salvation than another.  It can also be argued that God is<br>
a respecter of persons and can be swayed by His own finite creation.<br>
<p>
Before I close out -- I'd like to find out if anyone out there has any<br>
comments on Luke 18:1-8.  I've been looking at prevailing prayer and<br>
would like additional ideas on this topic.  Thanks.<br>

Our works do not save us.  But, our works will be judged.<br>
<p>
Is it fair to say that our works will be judged and if its our works<br>
for salvation sake it won't account for much.  But if its His works<br>
in us then that will count for salvation.  He alone can read the<br>
heart and know what motivates us.<br>

Those who know a lot more about cruxifixions than I do tell me that<br>
victims who have not been scourged can last for days on the cross.<br>
Those who have been scourged have their back muscles so ripped up<br>
that breathing becomes increasingly difficult such that surviving<br>
the day is not likely.<br>
<p>
The traditional pictures show Jesus nailed and the two thieves<br>
tied.  Also quite possible that while Jesus was scourged, the thieves<br>
were not.  If that be the case, then the two thieves may very well<br>
have survived the day.  Their legs were broken at the end of the<br>
day.  If the soldiers wanted them dead by sundown they would have<br>
speared them as they did Jesus.  If, as was so often their intent,<br>
the soldiers wanted a lingering death of several days, then breaking<br>
the legs insured the virtual imposibility of their escape during the<br>
night.  Breaking the legs would bring on death by suffocation if scourged.<br>
But not so if not scourged.<br>

<i>&gt; I was talking with a friend who lives in Loma Linda tonight.  He indicated</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the Medical Center is having severe financial troubles.  The cost</i><br>
<i>&gt; . . . .</i><br>
<i>&gt; . . . .</i><br>
<i>&gt; confirm these facts?  Is Loma Linda going to going down in financial flames</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than the literal flames of Battle Creek?</i><br>
<p>
Here in the Portland area the hospitals are down sizing.  The economy is<br>
down and people cannot afford to go to the hospital like they used to.<br>
The economics of Loma Linda has been in trouble for several years.  If<br>
hospitals here that were doing great are now feeling the pinch and<br>
laying off staffs I'd suspect things could be rather grim at Loma Linda.<br>

In response to Eric Snyder's questions:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;    v26   and everyone who lives and believes in Me shall never die.</i><br>
<i>&gt;          Do you believe this ?"</i><br>
<p>
To the Christian the first death is of little importance.  It is only<br>
a sleep, till Jesus comes.  The second death is what is spoken of here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;philippians 1:21</i><br>
<i>&gt;        "For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain."</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;in verse 23 Paul</i><br>
<i>&gt;    states "But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much</i><br>
<i>&gt;    better."  Then verse 24 "yet to remain on in the flesh is more</i><br>
<i>&gt;    necessary for your sake."</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Compare this with 2 Corinthians 5:8</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;       "we are of good courage, I say and prefer rather to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;       absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord."</i><br>
<p>
When the Christian dies, he or she sleeps till Jesus comes.  The next<br>
thing he or she knows is Jesus coming.  So, for us, death is<br>
immediately followed by Christ's return and the heavenly reward, even<br>
though many years may intervene.<br>
<p>
I think many Christians would echo Paul's desire to be absent from the<br>
body and present with the Lord.  When Jesus returns we will receive a<br>
new body, without the sinful tendencies and desires of the present<br>
body.  Just think of it -- no more constant struggle with the old man,<br>
always trying to regain control!<br>
<p>
So, these verses are consistent with the Adventist position.  You<br>
might also note that the term ``immortal soul'' never appears in the<br>
Bible.  Rather, it says that God only has immortality.<br>

I think SDA-L should remain unmoderated.  Abuse of this network just hasn't<br>
been a problem.  As long as SDA-L stays away from heavy doctrinal<br>
discussion and discussion of touchy issues within the church, we'll be fine.<br>
In the past most SDA-L members indicated that they didn't want to get into<br>
those kind of wars, which are the most likely to generate flames.  In<br>
my opinion, these issues are best reserved for SDAnet with moderation.<br>
 <br>
But outside of these areas there is still plenty to talk about.  Maybe<br>
the best thing to do is to form a collective leadership for the list<br>
who can come up with ideas for constructive discussion.<br>
 <br>
Remember, to the extent that SDA-L is unmoderated, so also is SDAnet,<br>
because all messages from SDA-L get passed on to SDAnet without my clearance.<br>
 <br>
SDAnet members, if you receive two copies of this message send me mail<br>
and I can tell you how to avoid that.<br>

On Tue, 28 Apr 1992 12:32:19 -0400 (EDT) you said:<br>
<i>&gt;Our works do not save us.  But, our works will be judged.</i><br>
<p>
  I could agree with this if the last sentence continued with something<br>
like 'and our works, or lack thereof, can keep us from being saved.'<br>

On Sun, 26 Apr 1992 17:21:29 -0400 (EDT) someone said:<br>
<i>&gt;Here are some more thoughts on the discussion of death as a sleep.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        When Jesus said, ``Verily I say unto thee today thou shalt be</i><br>
<i>&gt;with me in Paradise,'' the fact that he said it ``today'' is highly</i><br>
<i>&gt;significant.  He is saying, Today, when I am hanging on a cross,</i><br>
<i>&gt;today, when the crowd is mocking me, today, when it seems like all is</i><br>
<i>&gt;lost, today, I am promising you that you will be with me in Paradise.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jesus knew that that was a very special day, the day on which he was</i><br>
<i>&gt;purchasing the pardon for our sins.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        The fact that other times that Jesus said ``Verily I say unto</i><br>
<i>&gt;thee'' the comma occurs next, is interesting but not by itself</i><br>
<i>&gt;conclusive.</i><br>
<p>
  This would make the Bible so much harder to understand, let alone<br>
believe, than I think God intended.  For this example we are asked to<br>
believe that after establishing a clear pattern of speech Jesus would<br>
alter that pattern just once and expect everyone to 'know' that he meant<br>
it another way.<br>
<p>
  Not taking what is written more literally is why some believe that<br>
believers don't have to get baptised, Jesus really didn't mean me when<br>
he said all those things.  Etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        We really need to be careful to take the entire Bible</i><br>
<i>&gt;testimony on each topic.  The reason we have so many churches is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;some people take a few verses here and there and base a doctrine on</i><br>
<i>&gt;it.  Others take a different selection of verses and come to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;different conclusion.  We need to look at the entire Bible testimony</i><br>
<i>&gt;on each topic and make our decision based on that.</i><br>
<p>
  But, where there is cause to think two sources are saying different<br>
things, whose words should we put more weight behind?  Jesus and written<br>
testimony centurys/millenium newer than OT prophets or words that we are<br>
told were exactly copied throughout the ages without even one deviation?<br>

  Looking at my new Strong's I noticed that almost all of the uses of<br>
the word 'spirit' in the NT are the same Greek word.  It is used by<br>
Jesus before he died, when referring to the Holy Ghost, for evil spirits<br>
and good spirits.  Likewise, the OT almost always uses the same word<br>
when speaking of spirits.<br>

<p>
don't know what this was in response to, but....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The traditional pictures show Jesus nailed and the two thieves</i><br>
<i>&gt;tied.  Also quite possible that while Jesus was scourged, the thieves</i><br>
<i>&gt;were not.  If that be the case, then the two thieves may very well</i><br>
<i>&gt;have survived the day.  Their legs were broken at the end of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;day.  If the soldiers wanted them dead by sundown they would have</i><br>
<i>&gt;speared them as they did Jesus.  If, as was so often their intent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the soldiers wanted a lingering death of several days, then breaking</i><br>
<i>&gt;the legs insured the virtual imposibility of their escape during the</i><br>
<i>&gt;night.  Breaking the legs would bring on death by suffocation if scourged.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But not so if not scourged.</i><br>
<p>
  As the Bible says the Jews wanted the bodies, including the two<br>
theives, down before the start of the Sabbath.  As a young Lutheran I<br>
was taught that the reason Jesus was poked instead of broke was 1) to<br>
fulfill prophecy that not a bone would be broken and 2) to make sure he<br>
was dead (what came out the wound was not the blood of a perso alive,<br>
but one who had been dead awhile).<br>

[Dave was suggesting here that the thieves may not have died that day<br>
and thus didn't go to paradise or anywhere.  I have heard commentators <br>
suggest both ways.  SCT]<br>

[What I didn't say is that often people who disagree with the teaching <br>
will leave on their own accord.  But a growing number of people are<br>
changing this trend.  They think that by staying in, eventually enough<br>
others will agree with them and the teaching of the church will change.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt; In the discussion about the evangelical beliefs a few days ago, Ruben </i><br>
<i>&gt; put in the statement "but God does not reign on earth now..." when</i><br>
<i>&gt; referring to the doctrine of the kingdom of God.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
They said<br>
<p>
Quote<br>
<i>&gt;         cross, His bodily resurrection and His present reign in heaven and</i><br>
<i>&gt;         earth.</i><br>
Unquote<br>
<p>
I said ....<br>
<p>
Quote <br>
	But Jesus doesn't rein on this earth (ecept in our hearts ) that will<br>
	only happen after the 2nd coming the prince of this world is Lucifer, <br>
	thats why suffering and death abounds.<br>
Unquote<br>
<p>
God yes, Jesus no.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would like to suggest that the prayers of 2000 years of Christians,</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Thy Kingdom come" have not gone unanswered.  Since Christ's death on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cross, Satan is a defeated foe.  But through all time, before and</i><br>
<i>&gt; after</i><br>
<i>&gt; the cross, God is and has been sovereign on this earth.</i><br>
<p>
What happens then to your interpretation of the Rock and statue<br>
in Daniel 2 ? Jesus is not currently performing His Kingly role in heaven<br>
but rather His priestly role. When He lays off His priestly robes in as <br>
outlined in Rev then it is that He puts on His Kingly robes and Comes as the<br>
King to reclaim the earth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now this doesn't mean that we will see a postmillenial style "reign of</i><br>
<i>&gt; peace" on earth like many evangelicals believe.  But we do have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kingdom of Grace</i><br>
<i>&gt; here and now and we shouldn't forget it.</i><br>
<p>
When Jesus was asked where the Kingdom of God was to be found He simply said<br>
"The kingdom of God is within you" ! Jesus understood the situation.<br>
<p>
Yes God still holds the reigns but He who comes to receive the dominion and<br>
the power and the glory has not yet arrived. We await that moment. <br>

<i>&gt; It is true that many Adventists now emphasize the fact that we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; born in a state of separation from God, and thus unable, on our own,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to choose to do right.  And it is only through faith in God that this</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship can be restored:  "Everything not of faith is sin."</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, I do not know of a single Adventist that believes in original</i><br>
<i>&gt; sin or inherited guilt.  We are born with Adam's separation from God,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but not with Adam's guilt.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Does being born separate from God mean that one is born in a "lost" condition ?<br>
if so, then it means the same as original sin.<br>

<i>&gt;  1. Every 2000 years something big happens.  Creation - Flood - Christ - 2nd</i><br>
<i>&gt;     advent. </i><br>
<p>
Flood 1656 After Creation<br>
Christ 4000 A.C.<br>
2nd Coming .... 6000 A.C. (?)<br>
<p>
EGW suggests this world won't continue much more than 6000 years.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  2. A day equals a thousand years with God.  Creation is 7 days, therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt;     the world will last 6000 years plus a seventh day of rest.  Perhaps someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;     who teaches this could better explain this one.</i><br>
<p>
Not that I teach this one, but the idea behind this is that the bible says<br>
that 6 days shall man labour, ie do the works of man. the seventh is the day<br>
of rest. The millenium is the 7th figurative day when the earth and man rests <br>
from sin, which he has been laburing hard at for the preceeding 6 figurative <br>
days.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  3. Ellen White said that the world would last 6000 years.  She said sin would</i><br>
<i>&gt;     reign for 6000 years.  I also saw whre she said the world was 6000 years old </i><br>
<i>&gt;     at her time.  I saw her say that the flood was 4000 years ago in her day.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Does this mean that these dates are exactly true?  My faith in ellen White</i><br>
<i>&gt;     soes not stand or fall on a legalistic reading of a few numbers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
I have looked into EGW's use of dates and numbers and found that she uses<br>
them in a general sense and always rounds them off to the nearest hundred<br>
or thousand. Bascially she rounds up to the same order of magnitude. So<br>
we can't use her use of dates as the basis of any time setting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I must say I have heard these arguments many a time, I have even heard the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  year 1996 spoken specifically from the pulpit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
According to some variants of biblical chronology, the first Advent occured<br>
in 4 B.C. exactly 4000 years after creation. Adding 2000 years to that<br>
date to make 6000 years brings us to 1996, except of course for those<br>
who remember to skip year 0 because it didn't exsist in which case the<br>
date becomes 1997.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If the year 2000 passes and Christ has not come, I will continue to sing,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "I don't believe He brought me this far to leave me."</i><br>
<p>
Yep me too, but I enjoy digging around escatological things.<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

In the discussion about the evangelical beliefs a few days ago, Ruben <br>
put in the statement "but God does not reign on earth now..." when<br>
referring to the doctrine of the kingdom of God.<br>
<p>
I would like to suggest that the prayers of 2000 years of Christians,<br>
"Thy Kingdom come" have not gone unanswered.  Since Christ's death on<br>
the cross, Satan is a defeated foe.  But through all time, before and<br>
after<br>
the cross, God is and has been sovereign on this earth.  Every act on this<br>
earth, good or bad, happens only with His consent.  Any sentence which<br>
begins with the words "God can't...." is by definition false.  (However,<br>
as I write,<br>
I realize there is a counterexample in the Bible.  Can anyone find it?)<br>
<p>
In the Old Testament God takes credit for both good and evil things that <br>
happen.  To ascribe anything less to Him is to strip Him of His omnipotence.<br>
Any power that the devil has is given at the express consent of God.  <br>
<p>
Now this doesn't mean that we will see a postmillenial style "reign of<br>
peace" on earth like many evangelicals believe.  But we do have the<br>
Kingdom of Grace<br>
here and now and we shouldn't forget it.<br>
<p>

John,<br>
The list is locked against signoff.  I have to process each signoff.<br>
There has been a 2 week delay in Bitnet messages recently, so I didn't<br>
get your message until today.  As I recall, however, you tried once before<br>

point 3 is the stickiest.  Internet access or at least uucp can be had<br>
reasonably cheaply, or free.  The well charges $15.00 per month, plus<br>
$2.00 per hour connect time to a direct internet feed, with ftp, etc etc<br>
available.  A uucp connection should be free.  Several of our colleges<br>
are on internet. any of them could make a uucp connection available to the<br>
CG.  The GC would poll the site, and thus THEY would pay for the connection.<br>
It would really be no skin off any of the universities/colleges that are<br>
hooked up to provide a uucp account.  I think that what I would recommend<br>
is that the GC use a machine (a pc, or some other unix box) to handle uucp<br>
and then re-distribute it internally over the internal network that they<br>
run.<br>

The confused description of Waggoner and Jones given by our antagonist <br>
on the other net is just that--confused.  They were considered liberals<br>
in their time for advocating a nontraditional stand on the role of the law<br>
of God.  Now, it seems that most of the advocates of their position <br>
(that Christ's righteousness can and should be ours) are termed either <br>
conservatives or perfectionists.  This is because the dominant position<br>
of the church has shifted from the ultra-legalism that was espoused <br>
in the days of 1888 to a position that pays lip service to righteousness<br>
by faith but has no idea what that actually is.  Most Seventh-day Adventists<br>
think they agree with the 1888 message but have no idea what it is.<br>
Even more troublesome is that most Seventh-day Adventists also think <br>
they agree with the exact opposite of that position, and cannot tell the <br>
difference between the two.<br>

In all the discussions that we have had on this net regarding the<br>
Branch Davidians, I am surprised that no one has brought up the issue<br>
of religious liberty.  After all, if we can defend Satanists and cults<br>
that offer animal sacrifices or get high on peyote, shouldn't we also<br>
defend a cult that happens to keep at least some of the same beliefs<br>
we do, such as the Seventh-day Sabbath?  I know, it could be<br>
embarrasing for us to defend a far-out cult that has claimed some<br>
affiliation with the Adventist church.  But we Adventists are not<br>
known for giving up any principles just because we might be<br>
"embarrassed."  <br>
    The following letter was published in the Wall Street Journal on<br>
March 15.  Although I do not entirely agree with the conclusions drawn<br>
by its author, I think it does a good job of illustrating a different<br>
side to the story than the one we have been used to hearing.<br>
<p>

    Wall Street Journal for Monday, March 15, 1993.<br>

  Waco Shootout Evokes Memory of Warsaw '43<br>
<p>
  On Feb. 27, black-uniformed men of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and<br>
  Firearms wearing "coal-scuttle" helmets and carrying German-made<br>
  machine pistols attacked the Branch-Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.<br>
  Fifty years earlier, in January 1943, black-uniformed SS men wearing<br>
  "coal-scuttle" helmets and carrying German-made machine pistols<br>
  attacked the Jewish compound in Warsaw, Poland.<br>
<p>
  The BATF men were searching for illegal weapons reported by a paid<br>
  informant to be in the Branch-Davidian compound.  The SS mnen were<br>
  searching for illegal weapons reported by a paid informant to be in the<br>
  Warsaw ghetto.<br>
<p>
  Reports from Texas indicate the Branch-Davidians kept to themselves and<br>
  harmed no one outside their compound prior to the BATF assault.<br>
  History tells us that the Jews kept to themselves and harmed no one<br>
  outside the Warsaw ghtetto prior to the SS assault.<br>
<p>
  The U.S. broadcast news media tell us that the Branch-Davidians<br>
  practice contemptible sexual rituals involving young children, so they<br>
  are an evil religious cult.  Nazi news media told the German people<br>
  that the Jews practiced contemptible sexual rituals involving children,<br>
  so they were an evil religion.<br>
<p>
  The BATF invited the U.S. news media to document the BATF assault to<br>
  show the American public how dangerous the Branch-Davidians are.  The<br>
  SS had propagandists document its assault to show the German public how<br>
  dangerous the Jews were.<br>
<p>
  Four BATF men were killed and 16 wounded in the initial assault on the<br>
  Branch-Davidian compound.  Eleven SS men were killed and an unrecorded<br>
  number wounded in the initial assault on the Warsaw ghetto.<br>
<p>
  After the initial assault, the BATF men magnanimously arranged a truce<br>
  so children could be evacuated from the Branch-Davidian compound (and<br>
  they could tend to their casualties).  After their initial assault, the<br>
  SS men magnanimously arranged a truce so children could be evacuated<br>
  from the Warsaw ghetto compound (and they could tend to their<br>
  casualties).<br>
<p>
  The BATF called up military units with armored vehicles to finish off<br>
  the Branch-Davidian compound after encountering fierce resistance<br>
  against the initial assault.  The SS called up military units with<br>
  armored vehicles to finish off the Warsaw ghetto after encountering<br>
  fierce resistance against the initial assault.<br>
<p>
  Fifty years have passed, but little has changed.<br>

Hello Steve,<br>
    I too am impressed on how well everyone on the net has done in<br>
presenting a well-balanced view of Adventism on the Christia net.<br>
Wouldn't it be a good idea for one or more of the major participants<br>
to write something up for inclusion in the Adventist Review?  I am<br>
sure a lot of Adventists would be very interested in how the Branch<br>
Davidian issue has provided opportunities for electronic witnessing.<br>
<p>
    This network is one of the few places I have found where<br>
Adventists from the entire theological spectrum within the Adventist<br>
church can be free to state what they believe without fear of being<br>
"flamed".  I truly believe our churches would be a lot more attractive<br>
places if we all spent more time trying to understand each other<br>
rather than in judgement and condemning each other.  Keep up the good<br>
work everyone!<br>

Steve's remarks about Waggoner &amp; Jones serve to illustrate the fact that<br>
we use the terms "conservative" and "liberal" in very much a relative way.<br>
<p>
I honestly think we have few, if any, true liberal theologians in the SDA<br>
church. Those whom we think of as liberal within our church are far from<br>
being liberal in the broader sense. Liberal theologians in general seem to<br>
give and take without restriction when it comes to Biblical authority and<br>
interpretation, far more than any SDA I know.<br>
<p>
Even in worship style the relativism thing holds. The "liberals" today <br>
would be considered "conservative" in any pentecostal/charismatic church,<br>
and may well have been considered conservative by some of the early SDAs.<br>
The "conservatives" would be considered "liberal" by some of the reformers,<br>
who were accustomed only to music without harmony, or to harmony without<br>
accompaniment, or whatever.<br>

To Bruce and Ruben...<br>
<p>
There are many tangents in which we could direct our energies.<br>
Fortunately, I've not followed this one.  But I like this statement from Bruce:<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;How about spending your bandwidth time building up people's faith</i><br>
<i>	&gt;in the Word of God instead of trying to tear it down.</i><br>
<p>
Don't take it personal Ruben.  We all (myself being chief) need to spend more<br>
time building our faith in the Word of God.  But I'll go even farther<br>
than Bruce,<br>
to say that there is a greater need for us to hunger and thirst after<br>
the Word Who<br>
&lt;IS&gt; God (John 1:1,2), which the Bible serves only as a map.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Just a question for us to consider. What does the AntiChrist mean to you ?<br>
<p>
Just to get you going, here is my definition.<br>
<p>
First of all we know that the AntiChrist is not someone who is openly<br>
antagonistic to Jesus and Christianity because thats what the word means :<br>
<p>
Lets see, Liddel &amp; Scotts "Greek - English Lexicon" says regarding<br>
the prefix "anti" as used in compound words such as "antiChrist" that<br>
it can have 7 meanings.<br>
<p>
1. over against<br>
2. in opposition to<br>
3. one against another<br>
4. in return<br>
5. instead of<br>
6. like<br>
7. corresponding<br>
<p>
Now W.E.Vine in his book "An Expositional Dictionary of New Testament Words"<br>
says regarding the word "antichristos"<br>
<p>
	"Can mean either against Christ or instead of Christ, or perhaps<br>
combining the two, one who assuming the guise of Christ opposes Christ,"<br>
(Westcott)"<br>
<p>
So we see that the antichrist apart from Satan as numero uno, and a certain<br>
owner of the 666 number as numero dos, it can also mean<br>
all those things which profess to be Christian but in effect are impostors<br>
of the real thing, surplanting it. In this way all false doctrines are of <br>
antichrist all false ministers are of antichrist, and should I say it much<br>
music that purports to be Christian but in reality isn't is also of antichrist.<br>
This definition would but naturally also include such things as the Apocripha,<br>
and any other forms of distortions of the truth.<br>
<p>
In fact the prefered location of antichrist and things of that spirit are<br>
naturally to be found, not outside of the church but within it, because <br>
that is the only way it can hope to "assuming the guise of Christiantiy <br>
opposes Christianity" so don't go looking ofr antichrist among the Satanists<br>
cause he won't be there.<br>
<p>
Q. where did the numero dos antichrist set up his throne, was it not on the<br>
very front pew of the church ?<br>
<p>
Anyway after considering all of that, how many of you consider that the <br>
antichrist is alive and well and working today in every congregation ?<br>
Or do we think that because we are SDAs we are magically excluded from<br>
his artifacts ?<br>
<p>
<p>
So hows that ? <br>
<p>
Of course now its over to all of you to show me how wrong I am. :^)<br>
<p>
Ruben.<br>

I want to add just a few more words to the discussion of _Spectrum_ (as<br>
a frequent contributor).  Like this list, it's a bit of fresh air in the<br>
church.  It was founded back in the late '60s (I have been a charter member<br>
of the Association of Adventist Forums, and have, I believe, a complete<br>
run of _Spectrum_).  It was founded by graduate students who wanted a<br>
freer, more academic forum to openly discuss topics of interest.  Even<br>
though it's now more journalistic, it still has an academic tone, and a<br>
commitment to academic free speech (though there are limits to what the<br>
editor will print).  For the church, I believe, it's been something of a<br>
case of can't live with it, can't live without it (something like the<br>
Seminary and Andrews University, but that's another topic entirely!).<br>
Because it has printed articles that the hierarchy doesn't like, not<br>
only the conservatives, but also many of the bureaucrats like to<br>
criticize it (for example, not wishing it to be indexed in the _SDA<br>
Periodical Index_) while at the same time surruptitiously (I didn't<br>
check the spelling of that) reading it.  In fact, I observed just last<br>
week a GC department head supplying his workers with copies of a<br>
particular article.  I have also observed none other than Mervyn Maxwell<br>
bring it to committee meeting and literally hide it under the table!<br>
<p>
I believe that most true liberals have left the church, feeling it not<br>
worth the effort to try to change, while the conservatives always seem<br>
to want to reform it in their image (and claim that they are the<br>
"mainstream").  Articles from a variety of viewpoints have been<br>
published in _Spectrum_, but most conservatives refuse to publish there<br>
so it does end up on the liberal end of the spectrum (pun intended).<br>
However, it also takes on something of the personal bias of the editor<br>
(and I may be getting myself in trouble here).  Many authors have noted<br>
that they open up the issue to read what they "wrote."  <br>
<p>
For those interested in joining AAF (and subscribing to _Spectrum_),<br>
it's $25 for 5 issues, $32 in countries other than the US, and right now<br>
$16.50 for students.  The address is Box 5330, Takoma Park, MD  20913.<br>

[From Marcus Stringer]<br>
I'm a little confused on the turn in this thread.  I thought I was up-to-date,<br>
but I might have missed something along the way.  Please help.<br>
<p>
1.  What points of interpretation, true or false, are<br>
     "liberals" saying that our "faith" is not affected by?<br>
<p>
2.  What points of interpretation are "conservatives"<br>
     marching ahead, showing that they are true?<br>
<p>
marcuss@microsoft.com<br>
<p>
<p>
[For the liberal example I am indebted to a certain AU professor who <br>
said:  "The Book of Esther is generally considered to be myth"<br>
Q:  "Does that mean it's not true?"<br>
"No, of course it's true"  --the point being that even if the early <br>
parts of the Bible were total legend, we could still draw many of the <br>
same supports for our faith.<br>
<p>
For the conservative example, I was thinking about Ruben's recent posts<br>
on the NIV showing how most of the modern translations follow a different<br>
reading than the KJV, and providing documentation that I had no idea <br>
existed.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt;Subject: SDA: Creation Science</i><br>

<i>&gt;Pre script:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Could everyone put a "SDA:" in front of their subject headings?  I get</i><br>
<i>&gt;upwards of 50 mail messages a day and I (and I would guess others feel</i><br>
<i>&gt;the same) would love to be able to identify SDANet mail traffic by looking</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the subject heading.</i><br>
<p>
Would it be possible for Steve's auto mailer to do that automatically.<br>
If posters are expected to add the SDA, its going to be inconsistent.<br>
Perhaps SDAnet instead of just SDA.<br>

[There is no such thing as "Steve's auto mailer".  I would have to <br>
edit every message and change the subject line by hand.  No sale.<br>
For those who <br>
have asked for the elm rules, I'm working on them, but a poster session<br>
at work has to come first.  SCT]<br>

First, William Johnsson of the Adventist Review when asked in open forum<br>
about the Review logo claims that the three wavy lines in the "A" of <br>
Adventist Review are a stylized representation of the three angels.<br>
It has previously gone around about what apostasy some conservatives <br>
interpret this to mean.<br>
<p>
Now to the issue of the "Three Angels Messages"<br>
<p>
It is my feeling that the "Three Angels Messages" and the gospel are<br>
the same and inseparable.  If any part of the SDA message exists which <br>
is not part of the core gospel, then we can dispense with it.  The <br>
fiction that there exists a "just know Jesus" gospel has led to many<br>
fruitless discussions.<br>
<p>
Nevertheless, SDA's tend to draw converts from those who are already<br>
Christian, even in some developing countries.  I agree that it is high<br>
time to get on the front lines and reach our share of the unchurched.<br>
That's why I'm excited about the current series of meetings we are having<br>
in the Chicago suburbs.  The Hinsdale SDA church, host church for the<br>
meetings, is essentially redefining itself (at the cost of much pain)<br>
to better target and reach the unchurched.<br>

[From Tony Dyson]<br>
For those of you who wonder *why* your scientist friends are a bit<br>
worried by (a) the creation science movement, and (b) having recent<br>
creationism as a test of orthodoxy, have a read of this. It is a post<br>
I picked up from the newsgroup talk.origins. <br>
<p>
If the perception of Christianity by the academic community continues<br>
to be influenced by the excesses of the Creation Science movement in<br>
general, then how will we reach that segment of society with the gospel?<br>
Our credibility will be seriously in doubt, and that makes witnessing for<br>
Christ a little difficult.<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
[I'm letting this post through, but I censored Tony's subject line.<br>
Posts like this were exactly why I put the ban on creationism discussion<br>
on SDAnet.  This post came during an open discussion which I started,<br>
so I will accept it, but I will accept no other posts on creationism<br>
or evolution for a good long time.  If people want to read this stuff,<br>
they can read talk.origins.  Our debate is degenerating to the level<br>
of that sludge-pit.  Just for information, it's my understanding <br>
of SDA policy that we oppose the teaching of creationism in public <br>
schools because this would be establishment of religion.  If someone<br>
wants to continue the discussion on a religious liberty level, they <br>
are welcome to do so.  SCT]<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
Let's approach this from a different angle.  Suppose I tell you I have<br>
a scientific theory.  I'm not going to tell you what the theory is<br>
right now, but I am convinced it is true, and I would like to have you<br>
pass a law so that every high school student in the country will be<br>
taught my theory, and so that my theory will be given equal time with<br>
the standard theory.  I think this is only fair.<br>
<p>
Like I said, I'm not going to tell you what my theory is right now, but<br>
I will tell you some other things.  I will readily admit that 99.9<br>
percent of the world's scientists think my theory is pure garbage.  Not<br>
just wrong, understand, but trash.  I will also admit that of the small<br>
handful of scientists who do back my theory, most are non-productive<br>
nobodys with degrees in irrelevant fields, and who are by the way<br>
obligated to believe in my theory or else give up their religion.<br>
Nevertheless I want you to pass a law to force unwilling science<br>
teachers to teach my theory to high school students.<br>
<p>
Will you do it?  Does it matter even a little bit what the details<br>
of my theory are, or how good I am at convincing people who are not<br>
scientists?  Of course not!!!  High school students are just being<br>
introduced to science, and we teach them standard, non-controversial<br>
science, because that is all they are ready for.<br>
<p>
Why am I talking about the way we teach science to high school<br>
students?  "Scientific Creationism" is a deeply dishonest enterprise.<br>
Real scientists work to convince other scientists that their theorys<br>
are true, because only the other scientists can understand anyway.  If<br>
Einstein had been unable to convince other scientists of the truth of<br>
relativity, do you think he would have gone to the state legislature<br>
and tried to get them to pass a law and teach relativity in high<br>
school?  Such a thing would never occur to a real scientist.  But the<br>
Scientific Creationists make very little effort to convince the<br>
scientific community.  They would much rather have the matter decided<br>
by the lawyers and politicians, and that's where their arguments are<br>
directed, that's where their efforts go.  Their main goal is to have<br>
their transparently religous "theory" taught in our schools (or to<br>
surpress the teaching of evolution), and they are perfectly willing to<br>
bypass the scientific community to do so.  Arguments here as to the<br>
truth or falsity of their ideas are really rather irrelevant.  Until<br>
they can convince the scientific community that their ideas have merit,<br>
those ideas should not be taught as science in our schools!  And that's<br>
all the Creationists are after anyway.<br>

One of the gripes which is most often voiced by folks such as "Our Firm<br>
Foundation" is that Adventist sermons today don't contain enough doctrinal<br>
content, or else the wrong doctrinal content.  Maxwell was echoing that<br>
when he decried the lack of strong theological articles in the Review.<br>
<p>
I may be wrong about this, but I was not aware that the Review was ever<br>
intended to be either a theological paper or a missionary paper.  Nor<br>
is it obvious in the more than twenty years I have read it that the<br>
number of theological articles has declined; if anything it has<br>
increased over the last few years.  Those who would have more theology<br>
everywhere <br>
miss an important point:<br>
<p>
The church service is now a be-all and end-all for many church members<br>
who have not gone to church school, don't study a Sabbath School lesson, <br>
don't go to prayer meeting.  The pastor is forced to meet many more needs<br>
in less allotted time.  Theological expositions have had to give way to the <br>
more basic remedial work.  It's not uncommon for pastors to have to spend<br>
the first year of their three at a church in remedial work, healing disputes,<br>
convincing people that God even loves them.  During this time outreach <br>
is practically impossible.<br>
<p>
(Some, including me, would say that outreach is the only effective<br>
remedy.  But I digress).<br>
<p>
The theological renaissance of the SDA church can only come if we first<br>
have a renaissance in the home unit and place people in a position where<br>
they are emotionally ready to receive the gospel.  One of the chief problems<br>
that we face in the church today is that people relate to God exactly <br>
like they relate to their father, and both relationships are dysfunctional.<br>

[Third in a series of why the SDA church eventually needs everyone.  SCT]<br>
<p>
1)  We need someone on which to lay the guilt trip  "You may not be doing <br>
anything else, but at least you can give us money and soothe your<br>
conscience.  Guilt-ridden people like this have provided major funding<br>
for ministries in which I have been involved.  I need one of these right<br>
now.  Give me a call.:-)<br>
<p>
2)  We need lots of lukewarm people in the church so we can cherish the <br>
"Laodicea" image as part of our self-image as a church.<br>
<p>
3)  We need people to fill the pews to make it look like lots of people <br>
are coming to church.  It'd be real empty otherwise.<br>
<p>
4)  We need people to boost the membership count so we can get an<br>
assistant pastor again.  If they're paying tithe, so much the better.<br>

[From Drew Corrigan]<br>
<p>
Hi All,<br>
<p>
A friend of mine recommended I find and read the book,<br>
  "Seeking a Sanctuary"<br>
by Lockhart and Bull, published by Harper&amp;Row.<br>
<p>
The book is a discussion on changes in the SDA church over the years,<br>
but my (and my friend's) interest is how these changes have presaged<br>
similiar changes in the WCoG over more recent times.<br>
<p>
Has anyone read this book, and if so, what were your impressions?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Drew.<br>
<p>
[I read and enjoyed the book.  I would recommend it to any friend who is <br>
interested in an objective view of SDA's. Unfortunately, I believe <br>
it is now out of print.  SCT]<br>

Ruben Gonzalez:<br>
Of course now its over to all of you to show me how wrong I am. :^)<br>
<p>
Marcus Stringer:<br>
No Ruben, you are right in more ways than you think!<br>
This is why I love the discussions about the AntiChrist.  It makes us<br>
go back to our first love.  Not the laws of Moses, not even the Sabbath.<br>
In order to appreciate the "real thing", we have to keep our eyes fixed<br>
on Jesus THE Christ, or we all are antiCHRIST-like - - setting ourselves<br>
and traditions up in the place of Christ.<br>
<p>
Thanks Ruben.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
This is one of the best recent books on Seventh-day Adventism (along<br>
with Gary Land's Adventism in America), and really is a "must-read."  I<br>
would certainly recommend it to any library seeking a small but good<br>
collection on the subject.  If you can't find it locally where you are,<br>
check with your local library interlibrary loan department.  I see 206<br>
libraries listed on OCLC (our online "virtual library") that own this<br>
book.  I also see that our copy is currently available.  You should be<br>
able to find it somewhere.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hi All,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A friend of mine recommended I find and read the book,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   "Seeking a Sanctuary"</i><br>
<i>&gt; by Lockhart and Bull, published by Harper&amp;Row.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The book is a discussion on changes in the SDA church over the years,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but my (and my friend's) interest is how these changes have presaged</i><br>
<i>&gt; similiar changes in the WCoG over more recent times.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Has anyone read this book, and if so, what were your impressions?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Drew.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [I read and enjoyed the book.  I would recommend it to any friend who is </i><br>
<i>&gt; interested in an objective view of SDA's. Unfortunately, I believe </i><br>
<i>&gt; it is now out of print.  SCT]</i><br>
<p>
I read a good amount of it.  I found it in a remainder mailorder catalog.<br>
<p>
It seemed as though he was trying to be fair with the church.  I did not<br>
agree with everything in it, but it was the most fair book written about<br>
the church by a non-adventist that I have read.<br>

<i>&gt; Just for information, it's my understanding </i><br>
<i>&gt; of SDA policy that we oppose the teaching of creationism in public </i><br>
<i>&gt; schools because this would be establishment of religion.  If someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; wants to continue the discussion on a religious liberty level, they </i><br>
<i>&gt; are welcome to do so.  SCT]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
-----------------------------<br>
If I generalize the focus of your statement to the teaching<br>
of *origins* in public schools, would you still be concerned<br>
about the establishment of religion?<br>
<p>
If yes, do you also oppose the teaching of evolution as an<br>
explanation of the origins of all that is?<br>
<p>
If no, what is it about creationism (if not its view about<br>
origins) that raises the specter of the establishment of a<br>
religion?<br>
<p>
Please keep any answers at a very high level to ensure that<br>
this discussion remains focused on religious liberty and not<br>
creationism per se.<br>

In this area the lowest cost Internet connection (E-mail and news only) is<br>
$75/month.  FTP access would cost another $100/month.  I know because CUC has<br>
looked for lower cost connections.  This service would probably not support a<br>
PC since they only know UNIX.  I suspect that there is nobody at the GC that<br>
knows how to keep a UNIX system running.  In fact I am almost positive since I<br>
know people that have done PC support over there.<br>
<p>
I think that CUC would be willing to help the GC, but we are limited by the<br>
complete lack of an equipment budget.  Currently we only have one working<br>
modem, which of course is very busy.  To be fair to the students we would have<br>
to ask for monetary support.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think those who say Christ had a "sinful nature" and those who say he</i><br>
<i>&gt; had a "sinless nature", at least in the SDA church, are agreed about what</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christ was. What is not agreed is what sin is.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So my questions on "how to answer a cb" would include "what do you say to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; person who says that transgression of law is the only definition of sin".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I agree that this is the fundamental divisive question.  If we cannot<br>
come to an agreement on the definition of sin, then it really is<br>
pointless to discuss many of the other divisive questions such as the<br>
nature of Christ.  This is a question that I have been struggling<br>
with for some time.  Unfortunately, judging from the lack of responses<br>
to Tony's question, no one else seems to have a good answer either.<br>
<p>
To me, sinful acts are merely symptoms of the truly devistating<br>
disease of sin.  No matter how successful we are in treating those<br>
symptoms, if we do not treat the underlying disease, it will keep<br>
cropping up in other areas of our lives and eventually, it will kill<br>
us.<br>
<p>
Thus, I believe Justification is not only the legal forgiveness for<br>
our sinful actions, it also provides a cure for the disease of sin.<br>
(A good definition for legalism is "a preoccupation with our legal<br>
standing before God.")  If the disease of sin is cured, we won't have<br>
to worry about the symptoms.<br>
<p>
I would like to see a response from some of the "concerned brethern"<br>
on the net.  Is any consensus possible?<br>

Steve writes......<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The church service is now a be-all and end-all for many church members</i><br>
<i>&gt;who have not gone to church school, don't study a Sabbath School lesson, </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't go to prayer meeting.  The pastor is forced to meet many more needs</i><br>
<i>&gt;in less allotted time.  Theological expositions have had to give way to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;more basic remedial work.  It's not uncommon for pastors to have to spend</i><br>
<i>&gt;the first year of their three at a church in remedial work, healing disputes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;convincing people that God even loves them.  During this time outreach </i><br>
<i>&gt;is practically impossible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
This may be true.  The real question could be, "Why is it true?"  More or less,<br>
the chicken and the egg arguement.  "Which came first?  The lack of study by<br>
the membership or the lack of leadership by the local elder/minister team?"  <br>
<p>
(Not placing blame, just wondering out loud about what Steve and I have seen<br>
 in different parts of the country)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(Some, including me, would say that outreach is the only effective</i><br>
<i>&gt;remedy.  But I digress).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The theological renaissance of the SDA church can only come if we first</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a renaissance in the home unit and place people in a position where</i><br>
<i>&gt;they are emotionally ready to receive the gospel.  One of the chief problems</i><br>
<i>&gt;that we face in the church today is that people relate to God exactly </i><br>
<i>&gt;like they relate to their father, and both relationships are dysfunctional.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Steve Timm</i><br>
<p>
It also must come from our leadership.  If our leadership refuses to trust the<br>
membership, dictates conditions of membership, does not believe that the members<br>
are competent to be part of major efforts, well, it's not going to happen.<br>
<p>
Sermons are to inspire AND teach.  We should want to be part of the "church<br>
invisible" and not just good bench warmers.  This is a dual problem for the<br>
SDA church.  The services need to be such that bench warming is no longer an<br>
option in our churches.  EVEN if the tithe is dropping like a rock.  By the <br>
same token, the leadership is going to be REQUIRED to provide meaningful<br>
opportunities to serve.<br>
<p>
This spring our church had an evangelistic series (didn't yours  :-)) and if<br>
there were not enough positions to serve physically, there was a prayer group<br>
that was going on in the back room, every night, every minute of the night<br>
during the meetings.<br>
<p>
We need, as members to demand that opportunities be made available.  If they <br>
cant be made available through the local church, then WE must make them.<br>
<p>
God and us may hold the leadership to a higher standard, but, does He not also<br>
hold you and I to a higher standard than other Christians?  On this network<br>
we can do much to share and encourage each other.  I would like to see more<br>
of that.<br>
<p>
I would also like to hear from others about their ideas for service.  What you<br>
are doing locally.  How it works, the problems that you have had.  After all,<br>
why re-invent the wheel in every church?  Also, why stay with the canned <br>
programs that haven't worked?<br>
<p>
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm????????????????<br>
<p>
All thoughts welcome and appreciated.<br>

Here's a question which has occurred to me of late. I'd be interested to <br>
hear your responses to this.<br>
<p>
Christians have a clear divine mandate to share the gospel. This can be<br>
seen in the gospels alone, by the fact that Christ directed his disciples<br>
to visit towns &amp; villages etc, and of course there is also the great<br>
commission. <br>
<p>
Reading Revelation, I find three angels flying over the Earth, crying with<br>
a loud voice "Fear God &amp; give glory to him" and so on. <br>
<p>
Historically, SDAs have felt called to "preach the three angels' messages"<br>
as an important part of their mission. In fact, in many cases it seems that<br>
this has eclipsed even the preaching of the gospel. One of the things the<br>
ultra-conservatives like to do here in Australia is to use the three-angels<br>
logo on all their advertisements and correspondence, partly as a protest<br>
over the organization's choice to use a more modernistic/abstract logo.<br>
(I don't know whether that new logo is worldwide or not).<br>
<p>
Anyway, my question is this: Christians are definitely called to preach the<br>
gospel. Is there a similar mandate for "preaching the three angels' messages"?<br>
Why do we feel the need to pass those messages along for the angels? Have<br>
we been asked to do so, or do we see those three angels as purely figurative,<br>
and hence unable to actually cry "Babylon is fallen" and so on?<br>
<p>
This is not meant to be an attack on any given point of view, I am just<br>
interested in the Biblical mandate for that task which SDAs have considered<br>
their own.<br>

<i>&gt; I may be wrong about this, but I was not aware that the Review was ever</i><br>
<i>&gt; intended to be either a theological paper or a missionary paper.  Nor</i><br>
<i>&gt; is it obvious in the more than twenty years I have read it that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of theological articles has declined; if anything it has</i><br>
<i>&gt; increased over the last few years.  Those who would have more theology</i><br>
<i>&gt; everywhere </i><br>
<i>&gt; miss an important point:</i><br>
<p>
As long as I can remember the review has seemed to be mostly an Adventist <br>
News paper.  But I do have the Ellen White articles in the review.  These<br>
were very substantial theological articles.  We are talking about the<br>
late 1800s and early 1900s.  but at some time it was a paper to express<br>
theology.  <br>

<p>
As far as it goes, this is a reasonable way to define that which is<br>
antichrist.  But does it help us to identify it?  After all, when it<br>
comes down to the crunch, even the biblical canon was defined by men,<br>
not by God.  Luther, for instance, was not comfortable with the book of<br>
James being in the Bible.  I'm not claiming that Luther is right about<br>
everything he taught.  Does that make him the antichrist, though?  How<br>
"wrong" can someone be before they qualify as the antichrist?<br>
<p>
A loose definition like this makes it easy to call anything we disagree<br>
with the antichrist.<br>

It seems as though one of the main points of Maxwell's letter has<br>
gone by without comment.  What are some thoughts on Maxwell's claim that<br>
the attack on the independent ministries was really an attack on <br>
conservatism in general.  He saw this because there has not been a reprimand<br>
of some liberal ministries and individuals.  I do not believe he said this<br>
directly, but this is what I gleaned from his letter.<br>
<p>
I guess I should change the word attack to a less explosive word.<br>

<i>&gt; [Third in a series of why the SDA church eventually needs everyone.  SCT]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)  We need someone on which to lay the guilt trip  "You may not be doing </i><br>
<i>&gt; anything else, but at least you can give us money and soothe your</i><br>
<i>&gt; conscience.  Guilt-ridden people like this have provided major funding</i><br>
<i>&gt; for ministries in which I have been involved.  I need one of these right</i><br>
<i>&gt; now.  Give me a call.:-)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2)  We need lots of lukewarm people in the church so we can cherish the </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Laodicea" image as part of our self-image as a church.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3)  We need people to fill the pews to make it look like lots of people </i><br>
<i>&gt; are coming to church.  It'd be real empty otherwise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4)  We need people to boost the membership count so we can get an</i><br>
<i>&gt; assistant pastor again.  If they're paying tithe, so much the better.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Steve Timm</i><br>

I am forced to believe this is tongue-in-cheek humor.  That bothers<br>
me for a couple of reasons.<br>
<p>
1.  First of all, I see nothing humorous about the subject of luke-<br>
warm worshippers; Jesus made some extremely serious statements about<br>
them (Rev. 3:16-18).  You may as well joke about the lost.<br>
<p>
2.  Being that we have lost some subscribers due to the volume of<br>
messages, empty messages such as these may just be the straw that<br>
breaks the camel's back.<br>
<p>
3.  T-in-C humor is usually made by people who, in some small way,<br>
believe what they are saying.<br>
<p>
The stated conclusion is wrong: the church does not need lukewarm<br>
worshippers and is better off without them (1John 2:19).<br>
<p>
Dan Blake<br>
<p>
P.S.  Steve, don't forget your own request that net-traffic subject<br>
lines begin with SDA:.  You are going to have to lead by example if<br>
you hope to get general compliance.<br>
<p>
[It was not my request.  I oppose this idea and have no plans to start.  SCT]<br>

<i>&gt;Paul claimed to be preaching the gospel, in fact, the *only* gospel, yet he</i><br>
<i>&gt;had no knowledge of the three angels' messages, at least he didn't refer to</i><br>
<i>&gt;them. I have heard people say that they believe the three angels' messages</i><br>
<i>&gt;are part of the gospel, but I'm not sure that I feel comfortable with that</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the light of what Paul had to say. I'm just not sure whether we're not</i><br>
<i>&gt;redefining "gospel" to suit our own understanding of what the people should</i><br>
<i>&gt;hear.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Tony</i><br>
<p>
Our calling in life is to love God supremely and our neighbors as ourselves.<br>
The sad fact of human existence is that sin keeps us from doing this in our <br>
own strength.  The good news of the gospel is that God offers<br>
forgiveness for our failings in this regard and restoration to full and<br>
complete relationships.  <br>
<p>
It's my firm belief that no part of the Adventist message is dispensable<br>
if the full restoration promised by the gospel is to be achieved.  Proving <br>
that statement could well be a life's work.  So instead, I ask, what do you <br>
think exists in the three angels message that could be dispensed with and <br>
still preach "the full gospel".  What about church doctrines in general?<br>
On the contrary, is there anything in the full gospel that is missing<br>
from the "three angels message" or the larger SDA message as a whole?<br>
<p>
Getting people to just "be saved" and proceed to store their generic and<br>
dysfunctional relationship with God in their filing cabinet, with no<br>
effect on their lives, is not the gospel to me.<br>

Dan Blake comments on my opposition to teaching creationism in public<br>
schools, and asks if I would ban any teaching on origins for the same<br>
reason.<br>
I do feel that people such as Carl Sagan ought to be muzzled from making <br>
epistemological statements, whilst claiming the authority of a scientist.<br>
Evolution as well as creation often transcends the realm of science<br>
in the claims that are made in the name of science.  I support the<br>
teaching of science that relates to the data at hand.  If there is<br>
evidence that supports a young earth, it ought not to be suppressed. <br>
<p>
It is, however, difficult to talk about Creation Science without<br>
referring to a Creator.  Without the Creator, creation science has no<br>
meaning  (neither does evolutionary science have any meaning without a<br>
creator).  Some sample curricula do exist for public schools to discuss<br>
creation evidence.  In some years the church school I went to used a<br>
creationist Biology textbook.  But the Biology teacher (a<br>
creation-believing SDA minister, I might add)<br>
abandoned this text for a more conventional one mainly because the<br>
textbook was not of as good a quality.  I can see how the creationist<br>
evidence<br>
can be covered effectively in a church school classroom, but I don't know<br>
how this could be done in a public school classroom.<br>

One point about the 3-angels messages and our uderstanding of Daniel<br>
Revelation prophecies:<br>
<p>
Without this understanding the Ecumenical Movement would certainly have<br>
its appeal.  Hey, UNITY, who can argue with that theme?  Instead we<br>
see this movement for what it is and have to pull back.  Even go the<br>
other way to remain pure on what the Bible and SOP have taught us.<br>
Ecumenical membership requires that no member church preach any sermons<br>
against what another member church's theology.  Whats left is the<br>
"love" gospel.  Now of course there is nothing wrong with preaching<br>
about love, especially Agape.  Certainly!  But what about the texts<br>
that speak of "all scripture" and the "meat".  Is pablum Christianity<br>
all that is allowable for Unities sake?  NO, all scripture is meat<br>
for study.  Without the 3-angels messages, how would we know that?<br>

I've always understood the three angels' messages as a God-inspired call<br>
back to THE GOSPEL ... that is, the true Apostolic Gospel.  The imagery<br>
of the three angels in mid-heaven is designed to denote the urgency of the<br>
times, given that entrance has been made into the "time of the end" of<br>
Daniel 12 -- but the Gospel message remains unchanged -- Jesus Christ, the<br>
same yesterday, today, and forever.<br>

Shermon,<br>
<p>
I don't know everything, (thank God), but I do think that there were <br>
two liberal groups<br>
which the General Conference took to court over using the name<br>
"Seventh-day Adventist."  One was/is a church, and the other a support group.<br>
<p>
This seems to be a repremand in my thinking.  How many more "liberal" groups<br>
would Maxwell like to see repremanded?<br>

In defense of myself...I did in fact censor that subject line before sending<br>
that post in. The original foul language present there was not my own, and I<br>
deliberately tried to remove the offensive content without obscuring what the<br>
original poster had written there.<br>
<p>
I should also state categorically that the post did *not* reflect my personal<br>
beliefs about creation, evolution, or the appropriate way to discuss either.<br>
Apart from the subject line, it did however seem to me to accurately represent<br>
some of the views held by scientists in the general community. Many people in<br>
the Christian church are not exposed to either the negative views or the<br>
contrary evidence, and a lot of those people will never read talk.origins.<br>
Heck, *I* don't even read it, I was just looking through the list of newsgroups,came across it and thought I might have a quick look. There was so much <br>
trash there that I won't be wasting the time to look there again, but I <br>
thought I might share that one post with all of you guys.<br>
<p>
If anyone felt that it was "gutter level", then I apologize for sending it. I<br>
myself didn't get that impression, maybe it was just due to the fact that I<br>
had just finished looking at some that definitely were down there. I wasn't<br>
trying to start an argument, either, just to add a perspective probably not<br>
held by *anyone* on SDAnet.<br>

In defense of myself...I did in fact censor that subject line before sending<br>
that post in. The original foul language present there was not my own, and I<br>
deliberately tried to remove the offensive content without obscuring what the<br>
original poster had written there.<br>
<p>
I should also state categorically that the post did *not* reflect my personal<br>
beliefs about creation, evolution, or the appropriate way to discuss either.<br>
Apart from the subject line, it did however seem to me to accurately represent<br>
some of the views held by scientists in the general community. Many people in<br>
the Christian church are not exposed to either the negative views or the<br>
contrary evidence, and a lot of those people will never read talk.origins.<br>
Heck, *I* don't even read it, I was just looking through the list of newsgroups,came across it and thought I might have a quick look. There was so much <br>
trash there that I won't be wasting the time to look there again, but I <br>
thought I might share that one post with all of you guys.<br>
<p>
If anyone felt that it was "gutter level", then I apologize for sending it. I<br>
myself didn't get that impression, maybe it was just due to the fact that I<br>
had just finished looking at some that definitely were down there. I wasn't<br>
trying to start an argument, either, just to add a perspective probably not<br>
held by *anyone* on SDAnet.<br>

Paul claimed to be preaching the gospel, in fact, the *only* gospel, yet he<br>
had no knowledge of the three angels' messages, at least he didn't refer to<br>
them. I have heard people say that they believe the three angels' messages<br>
are part of the gospel, but I'm not sure that I feel comfortable with that<br>
in the light of what Paul had to say. I'm just not sure whether we're not<br>
redefining "gospel" to suit our own understanding of what the people should<br>
hear.<br>

<i>&gt; I am forced to believe this is tongue-in-cheek humor.</i><br>
My conclusion also.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; believe what they are saying.</i><br>
Maybe...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The stated conclusion is wrong: the church does not need lukewarm</i><br>
<i>&gt; worshippers and is better off without them (1John 2:19).</i><br>
<p>
Ultimately true; however, are there principles in Mat 13:24-30,36-43<br>
(which refers to the world) which apply to the church?   Granted, an<br>
application seems difficult, since the parable suggests that there are but<br>
wheat and tares.  However, I think the Scriptures indicates that some "tares"<br>
become "wheat" (Rom 5:10, Col 1:21) and the final and forever determination<br>
for those yet living occurs just before Christ's return (Rev 22:11).<br>
<p>
A good question is:  Per Rev 3:15, how can we encourage one another to<br>
become "hot", to quit straddling the fence, to stop being mugwumps,<br>
to purify our hearts and lives from double mindedness (James 1:8, 4:8)<br>
(trying to have it both ways, God's and the world's), to serve God with<br>
our whole hearts (Mark 12:33; 2 Chr 15:15; Ps 119:2,34; Jer 24:7),<br>
holding nothing back from full surrender (2 Chr 16:9a)?<br>
<p>
Oh so regretably, truth-bearers sometimes fail the standard of Eph 4:15,<br>
1 Pet 1:22, and 1 John 3:18.  But truth itself is not divisive among<br>
truth-lovers (John 16:13, 17:21); in the general body, it reveals those<br>
who are "hot" and those who are "cold" (Heb 4:12).  Sunshine (cf Rom 5:5)<br>
upon clay makes clay hard (cf Heb 3:8,15); sunshine upon wax melts it.<br>
Of what is your heart and mine?<br>
<p>
As the time of Christ's return nears, we need to examine our hearts<br>
(1 Cor 11:28a, 1 Pet 4:17), confess our stubborn, rebel heart (Ps 106:6,<br>
Dan 9:3-19), humble ourselves (2 Chr 7:14, 34:27; Prov 16:19; Isa 57:15;<br>
Luke 18:14; Col 3:12; James 4:6,10; 1 Pet 5:5,6), so that the things<br>
that break God's heart break ours also (Joel 2:13).<br>

<i>&gt;If I generalize the focus of your statement to the teaching</i><br>

<i>&gt;about the establishment of religion?</i><br>
<p>
	Yes there should always be a concern.  "Origins"<br>
(including creation) in a general sense _should_ be<br>
taught in public schools.  Zealots on both sides forget that there<br>
are more versions of our origin than one interpretation of creation.<br>
If the teaching is to be done right - in a *public school* setting - ALL<br>
variations of the theme should be taught, encouraging the students<br>
to develop and use critical thinking skills.  While we're at it, our<br>
religion based schools might benefit from presenting alternative<br>
views as well.  The heavens know we need at least one generation<br>
of critical thinkers in the Church. (notice "C")<br>
	In my opinion, there is nothing in the creation theory which<br>
should bar it from classrooms IF it is _just_ an *alternative* view and<br>
not taught as a gospel - the same goes for evolution, and other<br>
versions of origin.  This is the key question: "Are religious groups<br>
seeking to take over public domain with their teachings (to the<br>
exclusion of opposing, or alternative views)?"  Those who've sought to<br>
keep the teaching of creation out completely have been guilty of this<br>
censure- ship of alternative thought.<br>
	Check out your local public school boards.  Are there battles<br>
over teaching origins, sex education, who should be able to teach,<br>
what groups may meet in facilities, prayer in school, taxpayer money<br>
for vouchers to private schools?  If any of these have happened in the<br>
last year, you should know that religious and secular groups are fighting<br>
for "ownership" of public domain, and the training ground for the minds<br>
of this nation.<br>

<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; Just a question for us to consider. What does the AntiChrist mean to you ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; First of all we know that the AntiChrist is not someone who is openly</i><br>
<i>&gt; antagonistic to Jesus and Christianity because thats what the word means :</i><br>
<p>
I don't follow your logic here...why does it follow that AntiChrist means not openly<br>
antagonistic to Christ?  To me, to be against someone is very likely to mean<br>
antagonism towards that person.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So we see that the antichrist apart from Satan as numero uno, and a certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; owner of the 666 number as numero dos, it can also mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; all those things which profess to be Christian but in effect are impostors</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the real thing, surplanting it. In this way all false doctrines are of</i><br>
<i>&gt; antichrist all false ministers are of antichrist, and should I say it much</i><br>
<i>&gt; music that purports to be Christian but in reality isn't is also of antichrist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This definition would but naturally also include such things as the Apocripha,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and any other forms of distortions of the truth.</i><br>
<p>
As Malcolm stated, where do you draw the line as to what is truth and what isn't?<br>
 Who decides what Christian music is truth and which isn't?  What if the music<br>
doesn't even have lyrics?  I think it dangerous to go around labeling this and that<br>
the antiChrist because you interpret (thats what it comes down to doesn't it?) them<br>
as not truth.  I believe that truth and light from God are revealed in varying<br>
degrees to every individual, as they are able to handle it.  Could not a situation<br>
then arise where what was revealed as truth to one person has not been revealed to<br>
the other person, therefore according to your definition of the AntiChrist, the list<br>
of what is AntiChrist varies from person to person.  I don't believe this is what the<br>
Bible speaks of as "the" AntiChrist of the last days that will come and deceive many.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In fact the prefered location of antichrist and things of that spirit are</i><br>
<i>&gt; naturally to be found, not outside of the church but within it, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is the only way it can hope to "assuming the guise of Christiantiy</i><br>
<i>&gt; opposes Christianity" so don't go looking ofr antichrist among the Satanists</i><br>
<i>&gt; cause he won't be there.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway after considering all of that, how many of you consider that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; antichrist is alive and well and working today in every congregation ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or do we think that because we are SDAs we are magically excluded from</i><br>
<i>&gt; his artifacts ?</i><br>
<p>
I see a difference between "the" antiChrist and being antiChrist.  I would place<br>
your description somewhere in the second catagory.  The first refers to a specific<br>
single entity or person, not a dynamically changing list of things as the second<br>
catagory implies.  We as SDAs are not magically excluded from anything.  We all face<br>
the same temtations and trials that everyone else does, as did Jesus while on this<br>
earth.  But I can't say what or who the antiChrist is or when it will appear or if it<br>
has or hasn't appeared yet.<br>

I have seen this very thing in our church and others and find it sad that church<br>

that we can focus on our true mission as a church body.<br>
<p>
I also find it very sad that the church (conference) leadership can not see to it<br>
that the pastors be placed in a district for more than a couple years.  Studies have<br>
shown that a pastor's effectiveness begins after about 5 years, about the time that<br>
he is usually moved.<br>
<p>
Sometimes I wonder if having churches exist that cator to the thinking of groups of<br>
people in that the conservatives all go to one place, the liberals to another, the<br>
moderates to another, etc, may help this fueding.  But then the churches as a whole<br>
will probably fued between each other.  I know the Celebration churches sure take<br>
alot of criticism from the conservatives who are uncomfortable with their worship<br>
style.<br>
<p>
I wish there was an eash solution!<br>

One of the big problems we have when we give a label to an individual is<br>
when he has ideas that are considered liberal and conservative.  Marcuss<br>
seems to point out this problem in his Gage. <br>
<p>
IT would depend on who you asked whether someone was liberal or conservative.<br>
I know some people who would consider me too liberal.  I know others who<br>
consider me too conservative.  We might want to more precisely define such<br>
terms. <br>
<p>
I have read books by Adventists who would be considered conservative wanting<br>
a change in the church's interpretation of the seals and the trumpets.  I<br>
have also read articles by Adventists who would be conseidered liberal <br>
wanting the same thing.  Sometimes espousing the same interpretation.<br>
Labels are helpfull to a certain point in defining ideas, but they break<br>
down rather easily, as Marcuss shows.<br>
<p>
What the church needs is people with a pure heart and a love for truth.  This<br>
person will be considered liberal by some and conservative by others.<br>

Thanks for the excellent posts on "why the church needs...". I for one<br>
appreciate a bit of tongue-in-cheek humor, especially if it provides<br>
another non-threatening self-analysis tool!<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Reasons why God never received tenure at the university:<br>
<p>
     1. He only published one manuscript.<br>
     2. And it was in Hebrew.<br>
     3. And it had no references.<br>
     4. It never appeared in a refereed journal.<br>
     5. Some people even question if He wrote it.<br>
     6. Even if He did create the Earth, what has He done/published since.<br>
     7. His collaborative efforts are minimal.<br>
     8. The scientific community has had a difficult time replicating His<br>
        results.<br>

As I noted in a post I sent last week, I believe there are a number of<br>
intersting issues at stake involving a potential GC connection to the<br>
Internet.  As Steve correctly stated, one is cost.  Will Internet cost<br>
them less than ATTMail?  I think that it's important to remember that<br>
the Internet is far, far more than e-mail.  As a librarian, I see great<br>
value in telnet and ftp as well.  A commercial e-mail service seems<br>
terribly limiting to me.  I can envision providing information services<br>
here at Andrews that would be of value to the GC, but will only be<br>
available by direct dial or telnet.  I really think accessing SDA-Net<br>
(important as it is!) is really a fairly minor consideration for the GC<br>
in establishing Internet connectivity.  There appears to be a very low<br>
level of knowledge in the building about the Internet and what it is.<br>
The young man who is in charge of e-mail (I'm embarrassed to say I<br>
didn't get his name) didn't even know what it is.  Lowell Witz, who is<br>
in charge of that department, was away, but I understand is interested.<br>
<p>
It is my understanding that the GC currently pays about $1700 a month<br>
for ATTMail use.  That's a substantial cost.  It appears that it was<br>
originally designed primarily to allow the "men" (who are on the road a<br>
lot) to stay in touch with their secretaries (we wouldn't insult them by<br>
calling them "droids").  Obviously, this is a very limited use.  There<br>
are still people around (including the president of this university and<br>
at least one editor at the Review) who think computers are for<br>
secretaries and not for them.  We have a big educational job ahead of us<br>
to enlarge the horizons of the GC people.  I always get a fortress<br>
(defensive) feeling when in that building, and this could be a good tool<br>
for creating positive new networks.  There does tend to be something of<br>
a "them" and "us" mentality that I think could be lessened through this<br>
means.  The Internet tends to level the playing field.  There are many<br>
people there who I believe are willing to learn.  What we need is<br>
leadership.  This is an educational opportunity that I hope we don't<br>
miss.  Earlier there was discussion of the possibility of having a<br>
symposium on the church and the Internet.  The place to have the<br>
meeting, it seems to me, is right at the GC.  Unfortunately, each<br>
department of the GC seems to operate autonomously.  An obvious place to<br>
start is with their people in computing.  I believe we now have 2<br>
subscribers to this list from the GC.  I hope this number increases<br>
(particularly the computer people at this point).<br>
<p>
Alan points out that there are a number of avenues of getting into the<br>
Internet in the DC area.  These should be explored.  If the GC and CUC<br>
could do something cooperatively, so much the better (how about the<br>
hospitals in the area?).  The burden shouldn't fall on CUC, which<br>
appears to be in delicate financial help.  Working together, we can<br>
benefit all.<br>
<p>
When I orginally made my statement about the GC and the Internet, I was<br>
not primarily concerned about GC access to SDA-Net.  Again, we can<br>
invite them to join and I think everyone would benefit if some did.  I<br>
don't see it as a gripe session, but as an opportunity to communicate<br>
more effectively.  People will have to decide if they want to get their<br>
mailboxes "flooded" with SDA-Net mail or not.  When we post now to<br>
SDA-Net, I think we have to assume that it can go anywhere and to<br>
anyone.  This is not a secret organization.  I hope people wouldn't feel<br>
threatened by having more people at the GC "listening."  It needs to<br>
continue to be an open forum.  I was really sorry that DaveB's Sabbath<br>
School class feels "censored" by the church.  I'm happy that mine (a<br>
fairly liberal class in a fairly conservative church) does not.<br>
<p>
One final word on where SDA-Net fits in the "SDA Spectrum" (pun not<br>
intended).  Obviously we're not an official organization (and thus not<br>
listed in the _SDA Yearbook_ or conference directory).  We really don't<br>
fit with ASI either (which also publishes a directory, which<br>
unfortunately is only available to members) because we're not a<br>
business.  We fit, I believe, with those other "special interest" groups<br>
like the SDA professional and interest associations (Association of SDA<br>
Nurses or Adventist Horsemen's Association)--people with similar<br>
interests who are friendly toward the church and are generally<br>
supportive.  Currently there is no directory of such organizations that<br>
I am aware of.  Bill Johnsson at the _Review_ plans a special issue for<br>
the fall which will include information about such groups.  I hope we<br>
can get something in there.  I'm also working on a directory of SDA<br>
associations for publication there.<br>

Here is another paragraph taken from that book by Carson that I have<br>
quoted from previously here. This one is to do with verbal inspiration,<br>
and the reason I am posting it is that those opposed to verbal inspiration<br>
have tended to portray it as "dictation". If Carson's definition is indeed<br>
that held by the pro-verbal-inspiration people within the SDA church, then<br>
their position has been oversimplified by those wishing to discredit them.<br>
(A common and effective tactic used by everybody from salesmen and politicians<br>
right through.) Anyway, here it is.<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
quote....<br>
<p>
It is extremely important to understand what is meant, and what is not meant,<br>
by saying that the Bible "as originally written...is verbally and plenarily<br>
inspired." &lt;Baptist articles of faith&gt;  "Plenarily" means "fully." "Verbally"<br>
means that the inspiration extends even to the words written. In passing, I<br>
should point out that "verbally" does not entail the conclusion that the <br>
Bible was dictated by God. Most of it, according to its own witness, was not<br>
given in so immediate a fashion. Hence it is possible to distinguish betweem\<br>
the writing style of, say, Paul, and that of John. However, the inclusion of<br>
the word "verbally" is designed to protect us from vague notions of inspiration<br>
that suggest the human authors "felt inspired" or were "inspired" as to the<br>
general drift but not in the detail, or that their writings witness to the<br>
inspiration of their authors. In fact, divine inspiration so operated that<br>
even where the human authors were hammering out their own deeply felt and<br>
very personal concerns (for example, II Cor 10-13), the result was<br>
theopneustos, God-breathed (II Tim 3:16) even to the detail of the words<br>
used.<br>
<p>
unquote...<br>
<p>
<p>
The other alternative is that this passage may be designed to allow Baptists<br>
to believe in "thought inspiration" without feeling that they have violated<br>
their articles of faith. Does this summarize the position of the SDAs who<br>
believe in verbal inspiration, do you think, or do they believe the <br>
scriptures were dictated?<br>

Nothing really, I'd agree :^).<br>

How very true.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;to Tony's question, no one else seems to have a good answer either.</i><br>
<p>
A good answer to counter a CB ? Well I might suggest some but then I'd <br>
have to resort to some other authority other than the bible (such as<br>
St. Augustine). In which case any self respecting CB would reject it outright.<br>
<p>
Of course I would have some good answers to go the other way, but I'm<br>
sure not very many would be interested in hearing them. They would'nt<br>
be as exciting as Anti-CB calibre material.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I would like to see a response from some of the "concerned brethern"</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the net.  Is any consensus possible?</i><br>
<p>
Where are they ? arn't they all supposed to be retired ministers ?<br>
I didn't know any of them had net access. I wonder who could be refered<br>
to here ? umm,..<br>
<p>
It seems to be plight of the CBs that they have learnt the hard way that many<br>
times it just isn't worth the effort, no body really takes any notice<br>
of them anyway (esp. over here), and when they do, its not to throw<br>
flowers at them either. <br>
<p>
Alas I don't particularly want to get involved in another protracted<br>
discussion at the moment so I'll keep quiet (and make many people happy).<br>
<p>
As for consensus, I can't see it on the horizon, you can't have it <br>
both ways you know. Your entire theology stands or falls on your definition<br>
of sin, if you chose one definition one would do well to see where it leads.<br>
In one case it leads to things such as the immaculate conception and child<br>
baptism etc. In the other it leads to victory over sin.<br>
<p>
How about we all sit down with ZERO presumptions and ask God to lead<br>
our study of His Word, to find out the truth, not to gather arguments<br>
but to really seek truth, with a willing mind to leave aside any cherished<br>
interpretation that is not clearly supported by scripture. God will lead<br>
and teach those who are willing to be taught of Him.<br>
<p>
In fact its even easier than that get out your EGW index and find what <br>
EGW says is the ONLY definition for sin. That is unless of course you might<br>
feel that this is one of those cultural matters. Or that in this instance<br>
EGW's level of inspiration wasn't quite 100%.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<p>
Just thought I'd stir the hornets nest a bit. Anyway I plucked this off the<br>
soc.religion.christian.bible-study newsgroup and found it interesting here it<br>
is :<br>
<p>
What follows is a Doctrinal Basis of Evangelical Belief.  It is a summary of <br>
the Christian faith, and is used by Christian Unions which are affiliated<br>
to the Universities' and Colleges' Christian Fellowship (U.C.C.F.), which is<br>
the United Kindom affiliate of the International Fellowship of Evangelical<br>
Students (I.F.E.S.).<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
                        Evangelical Declaration of belief.<br>
                        =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br>
<p>
        The doctrinal basis of the Fellowship shall be the fundamental truths <br>
        of Christianity, as revealed in Holy Scripture, including:<br>
<p>
a       The unity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit in the Godhead.<br>
<p>
b       The sovereignty of God in creation, revelation, redemption and final <br>
        judgment.<br>
<p>
c       The divine inspiration and infallibility of Holy Scripture as <br>
        originally given, and its supreme authority in all matters of faith and<br>
        conduct.<br>
<p>
d       The universal sinfulness and guilt of human nature since the <br>
        fall, rendering man subject to God's wrath and condemnation.<br>
<p>
e       The full deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God; His <br>
        virgin birth and His real and sinless humanity; His death on the <br>
        cross, His bodily resurrection and His present reign in heaven and<br>
        earth.<br>
<p>
f       Redemption from guilt, penalty and power of sin only through the <br>
        sacrificial death once and for all time of our representative and <br>
        substitute, Jesus Christ, the only mediator between God and man.<br>
<p>
g       Justification as God's act of undeserved mercy, in which the sinner is <br>
        pardoned all his sins, and accepted as righteous in Gods sight, only <br>
        because of the righteousness of Christ imputed to him, this <br>
        justification being received by faith alone.<br>
<p>
h       The need for the Holy Spirit to make the work of Christ effective to <br>
        the individual sinner, granting him repentance toward God and faith in <br>
        Jesus Christ.<br>
<p>
i       The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in all those thus regenerated, <br>
        producing in them an increasing likeness to Christ in character and <br>
        behaviour, and empowering them for their witness in the world.<br>
<p>
j       The one holy universal Church, which is the Body of Christ, and to <br>
        which all true believers belong.<br>
<p>
k       The future personal return of the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge all<br>
        men, executing God's just condemnation on the impenitent and receiving <br>
        the redeemed to eternal glory.<br>
<p>
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br>
<p>
No here comes the tricky bit. <br>
<p>
Does this sound any different from your average SDA these days ? Yes or no. <br>
Is anything wrong with it ? yes or no. (if yes what)<br>
Will all the evangelicals who believe the above be saved ? Yes or No (why)<br>
<p>
<p>

At first glance of the evangelical beliefs I see some omissions from SDA<br>
beliefs but no contradictions.  Some of the evangelicals we have recently<br>
debating on CHRISTIA would say that that list was far too strict (especially<br>
that part about obedience).  If people think there are contradictions, <br>
I would like to know.  <br>

Several respondents have mentioned "the original gospel" as something<br>
distinct from the SDA message without saying what this may be.  Care to<br>
enlighten us?<br>

I am about to forward a directory of 300 or so E-mail addresses of <br>
various church institutions.  Net life is never going to be the same.<br>
You'll notice that Robert Folkenberg's address is among them, and (<br>
after the discussion about what if they were on) I feel it is now appropriate<br>
to welcome him as a SDAnet Digest reader.  Watch for the post, for which <br>
we have Harvey Brenneise to thank.<br>

[From Harvey Brenneise]<br>
While at the General Conference last week, I picked up the following<br>
list of e-mail numbers in paper and on disc.  I'll try loading this into<br>
this message and sending it out.  If it works, the credit is due to Dan<br>
Bidwell.  I can't discern the organizing principle of the first part of<br>
the list.  It certainly wouldn't win any awards for reference materials!<br>
I hope someday we can maintain a more complete list of this type in an<br>
electronic form.  These addresses all appear to be ATT-Mail, and of<br>
course do not include the many Internet and other addresses that are out<br>
there, particularly in the educational institutions.  For ATT-Mail, give<br>
the user id followed by @attmail.com.  I hope this is useful.<br>

cardiovascular system could not have supported much activity in our<br>
atmosphere.  Must have had X2+ density and more oxygen") and 2) that this<br>
promotes greater health and/or longer life ("* Hospitals today that have<br>
hyperbaric chambers -- X2+ pressure and higher oxygen -- result in much<br>
faster healing rates").<br>
<p>
Oxygen is necessary for aerobic metabolism but is a cellular toxin requiring<br>
special enzymes and mechanisms for dealing with it.  It is not a longevity<br>
agent nor can higher O2 levels promote health except in specific disease<br>
states where inadequate oxygen is present in the organism (such as lung<br>
disease).  When high levels of O2 are given, the risks include lung damage<br>
(due to oxygen free radical formation during reaction with cellular proteins)<br>
and, particularly in premature infants requiring long-term oxygen, blindness.<br>
 To suggest that a higher atmospheric O2 level would promote longer life or<br>
greater strength is simply not correct.  In general oxygen is a toxin to<br>
living organisms, necessary for aerobic metabolism only and carefully<br>
neutralized to prevent the rapid cellular damage uncontrolled oxygen can<br>
cause.<br>
<p>
I add my voice to Steve's asking that we Christians use our scientific data<br>
accurately regarding things such as Creation.  If we are ill-informed about<br>
our topic we risk sounding like the National Enquirer!<br>

Thanks for reading,<br>

La Sierra University is now well-networked, and Enoch Hwang (co-founder<br>
and soft-spoken listowner of this list) would like to move SDA-L<br>
there to orion.lasierra.edu, a machine for which he is directly responsible.<br>
This requires unix-based LISTSERV software.  Some people sent me a veritable<br>
cornucopia of info on this a few months back, unfortunately I was forced<br>
to delete it due to a disk space crunch.  If this information could be<br>
reproduced and sent to me (st0o@andrew.cmu.edu) or Enoch (UNCEHW@LLUVM.Bitnet<br>
or enoch@orion.lasierra.edu), we'd appreciate it much.<br>
<p>
SDAnet formed a small working board a while ago to discuss technical issues<br>
and list policy.  I think it would be good for SDA-L to do the same.  The<br>
time is almost right for a good special-niche list to start up.  If we<br>
can find that niche effectively and keep the traffic low, it would become<br>
a good place for people to land who drop SDAnet due to high traffic.<br>
Jerome Grimmer expressed his interest to help a while ago.  If Jerome<br>
is still interested, and if others are interested, they should let me know,<br>
or post to the list saying so.  I think that SDA-L board people should be<br>
subscribers to SDA-L in their own right and not just receiving the feed<br>
through SDAnet.  (of course any SDAnet person can join, set  NOMAIL, and<br>
fulfill that requirement.)  Also the SDA-L board shouldn't include any<br>
members of the current SDAnet board.<br>
<p>
What if SDA-L added to its current (very low traffic) menu of support and<br>
fellowship issues a feature of late-breaking SDA news?  (This is more<br>
appropriate for an unmoderated newsgroup than a bunched, moderated SDAnet).<br>

It is my understanding that signing up for internet does not necessarily<br>
entail having ftp, telnet, etc..  I think it is possible to have only an<br>
e-mail internet node.  However, I do concurr that the ftp and telnet<br>
services would be a great value for the GC when it comes to interfacing<br>
with libriaries like Andrews'.<br>

Regarding the "Evangelical Declaration of Belief," I found very<br>
interesting that the eleven doctrinal points listed are very "generic,"<br>
allowing for wide latitude in interpretation/application.    For instance,<br>
the "indwelling of the Holy Spirit... producing in [believers] an<br>
increasing likeness to Christ...." could safely cover everything from<br>
speaking in unknown tongues to ???   <br>
<p>
The doctrine of "the one holy universal church" is also fascinating,<br>
especially when viewed from an SDA standpoint.<br>
<p>
Several of the eleven declarations closely mirror similar statements in<br>
our own 27 points.  <br>
<p>
I don't think there is much at first glance that is strikingly<br>
objectionable about the evangelical beliefs.  Ruben asks if all the<br>
evangelicals who believe these 11 points will be saved; Luckily, God<br>
hasn't left that decision up to me....   <br>

I found very interesting Harvey's comments about the general lack of knowledge<br>
about the Internet on the part of GC "men."  This corresponds with what I<br>
have seen in the past ten years among SDAs in general -- that is, either a<br>
distrust in or a lack of committment toward new computer technologies. <br>
When computers are used, the expectation seems to be that they will simply<br>
"automate" function(s) currently being carried out by human beings.  In my<br>
opinion, our denomination is lagging far behind in technological areas<br>
such as computer telecommunications.  And, when I've approached individual<br>
administrators about the problem, I've been met with indifference.<br>
<p>
Have those of you on SDANet had similar experiences?<br>

<i>&gt; Several respondents have mentioned "the original gospel" as something</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinct from the SDA message without saying what this may be.  Care to</i><br>
<i>&gt; enlighten us?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The original Gospel can be summed up in one word: <br>
<p>
Judaism<br>
<p>
Think about it.  They were first  to champion the Sabbath, connecting it<br>
with Creation, and upholding the<br>
primacy of a Creator (instead of the wannabe idols of the time).  Both<br>
Paul and James cite Abraham as the model for dealings between God and<br>
man.  Jesus went through all the Jewish rituals Himself, from<br>
circumcision to Passover (let's not forget that the Last Supper was<br>
really a Passover seder).  In fact Jesus made it quite clear, in the<br>
punchline to the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus, that if someone<br>
doesn't pay attention to Moses and the Prophets not even the fact of<br>
someone coming back from the dead would phase them.<br>
<p>
Then again, I converted to Adventism because it was the most Jewish of<br>
the Christian religions I came across.<br>
<p>
One caveat: NO gospel, however original or eloquent, can save anyone.<br>
That's where grace comes in.  But that's another subject.<br>

You can get a connection to the well for a lot less up front fee.<br>
I think it is  $15.00 + $2.00 per hour via telnet.  Full FTP etc.<br>
I find having a simple uucp mail feed, and news reader is quite satisfactory.<br>
If I need something via FTP it is harder to get, but you can go through a mail<br>
server.  UUPC (the uucp port for the PC, is a very stable, smooth program<br>
coming in both DOS and OS/2 flavors.  A 286 with a 20 meg hd or 40 meg hd<br>
is a very cheap commodity (used) currently, and will work admirably<br>

I looking for someone who has read To Life by Harold Kushner or other<br>
works by Kushner and would like to talk about it.  For some reason I have<br>
always enjoyed Jewish authors such as Heschel, Potok and Kushner (don't<br>
tell on me, Kemmelman).  <br>
<p>
On page xi Kushner says, "The sages teach us that "in time to come,<br>
everyone will have to account for all the good things God created which he<br>
refused to enjoy."  I like that a lot better than what I was reared on,<br>
namely, that in the judgment one would have to account for every penny that<br>
came into our posession.<br>
<p>
Again on page 14 he plucks a responsive chord in me.  "Judaism is less<br>
about believing and more about belonging.  It is less about what we owe<br>
God and more about what we owe each other, because we believe God cares<br>
more about how we treat each other than He does about our theology."  I<br>
always considered myself to be a conservative SDA (perhaps a California<br>
born version of said animal) but then I spent three years on the campus of<br>
Southern College of SDAs as academic v.p.  I came away from the experience<br>
with the belief that if those conservatives treated people they way they<br>
did, their theology must be flawed.  Remember Peters and Waterman (In<br>
Search of Excellence)  if you find coffee stains on the airlines tray<br>
table you begin to wonder about engine maintenance.  <br>
<p>
I like his emphasis on the Jewish faith as family.  By this he means<br>
that even though they may be in complete disagreement, they can never be<br>
separated, because they are genetically family.  A rather nice model of God's<br>
commitment to humanity I would think. In contrast, in Christianity every<br>
time someone has a belief that is somehat different, a new denomination is<br>
created and community is strained if not broken.<br>
<p>
Have a great day.<br>

Hi again,<br>
<p>
<p>
Now that you have all had an opportunity to ponder the practice<br>
questions, here is the real thing.<br>
<p>
Are SDAs evangelical, without knowing it ?<br>
<p>
Should we all just be Seventh Day Baptists ?<br>
<p>

God never said that if you become a Seventh-day Adventist (or a Seventh-day<br>
Baptist, or a ...) and you will be saved.  No, He said Believe on ME and you<br>
will be saved.  I really don't think it really matters what "label" or "brand"<br>
of church you call yourself (as far as salvation goes), what counts it that you<br>
believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and follow His leading and study His word and<br>
spend time with Him in prayer, then God will show you what is truth for you and<br>
show you where changes need to take place in your life.  I realize that this may<br>
sound simplistic but I think that is the bottom line.<br>
<p>
So does it really matter if SDA beliefs overlap other churchs beliefs?  I think it<br>
great that there are other flavors of churches out there that have beliefs that are<br>
close to our own...that means they are that much closer to the truth as we know it.<br>
<p>
If God is truely leading in people's lives, don't you think He will lead them into<br>
what He thinks is truth and important for their lives?<br>

Marcus said:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know everything, (thank God), but I do think that there were </i><br>
<i>&gt; two liberal groups</i><br>
<i>&gt; which the General Conference took to court over using the name</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Seventh-day Adventist."  One was/is a church, and the other a support group.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This seems to be a repremand in my thinking.  How many more "liberal" groups</i><br>
<i>&gt; would Maxwell like to see repremanded?</i><br>
<p>
The two groups that the GC sued for trademark infringement were SDA<br>
Kinship, a support group for SDA gays and lesbians, and an independent<br>
church in Hawaii.  Kinship could probably fall in the category "liberal"<br>
but I believe the Hawaiian church was at the other end of the spectrum.<br>
Neither of these was particularly related to theology specifically<br>
although it might be argued that the church is embarrassed by Kinship<br>
and thus wants to distance itself from them.  Maxwell stated his<br>
"enemy," the Association of Adventist Forums and its journal _Spectrum_.<br>
There really aren't that many organized groups on the left side of Adventism.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; As for consensus, I can't see it on the horizon, you can't have it </i><br>
<i>&gt; both ways you know. Your entire theology stands or falls on your definition</i><br>
<i>&gt; of sin, if you chose one definition one would do well to see where it leads.</i><br>
<i>&gt; In one case it leads to things such as the immaculate conception and child</i><br>
<i>&gt; baptism etc. In the other it leads to victory over sin.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I agree with Ruben.  A whole lot hinges on your definition of sin.  As Ruben<br>
has stated, the answer to this question can lead to very different paths.  If<br>
there is any chance of consensus, you would have to start there.<br>
<p>
Ruben talks about the transgression of the law being the only definition<br>
for sin.  Others talk about a condition of sin.  I heard one Oakwood College<br>
theological student say, "Our very being is a sin."  I don't believe Ruben<br>
would doubt that we were born into the world in a bad state.  We were born<br>
into the world apart from Christ which is the only way you can live without<br>
transgression.  We were born apart from our power.  This, however, is very<br>
different than being born guilty of Adams sin.  If being born apart from <br>
power to do what is right is being born into a condition of sin, I would <br>
agree.  If being guilty at birth for someone elses transgression is <br>
being born in a condition of sin, I would not.<br>
<p>
The reason this is important is that in the first case when power comes, so<br>
does obedience.  So victory is possible through the power, not your power.<br>
If the first case is true, victory is not possible, for your living is sin.<br>
<p>
In my second paragraph, I presumed to state what Ruben might believe.  I<br>
guess I shouldn't have.  My connection is slow so I don't want to go up<br>
and erase it.<br>
<p>
Of course this looking at obedience will seem like legalism to some, but<br>
some people think that 1844 is fiction and that the Sanctuary is a face<br>
saving device.  <br>
<p>
I don't know whether I am a  CB.  Perhaps someone could tell me.<br>

Ruben quotes the charter for Soc.Religion.Christian.bible-study<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; d       The universal sinfulness and guilt of human nature since the </i><br>
<i>&gt;         fall, rendering man subject to God's wrath and condemnation.</i><br>
<p>
	Some of us would agree, but I do not believe in any guilt coming to<br>
	all of human nature as a result of the fall.  We all partake of the <br>
	fall when we sin, as all of us have done.  All of us except one<br>
	that is.  I should say we all take part of the guilt from the fall<br>
	when we sin.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; f       Redemption from guilt, penalty and power of sin only through the </i><br>
<i>&gt;         sacrificial death once and for all time of our representative and </i><br>
<i>&gt;         substitute, Jesus Christ, the only mediator between God and man.</i><br>
	Redemed by his death, saved by his life.  Yeah he died once as our<br>
	substitute.  Yes he is our mediator.  Actually as mediator he is<br>
	our priest.  When we talk about priest we talk about the sancutary.<br>
	This is fine, although that "once for all time" might be used to <br>
	attack the sanctuary.  At face value it is all right.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; i       The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in all those thus regenerated, </i><br>
<i>&gt;         producing in them an increasing likeness to Christ in character and </i><br>
<i>&gt;         behaviour, and empowering them for their witness in the world.</i><br>
<p>
	Why is it legalism when a SDA says this, but if anyone else disagrees<br>
	with it he should not be considered evangilical.  This is fine.<br>
	I would probably change the regenerated to being regenerated.<br>

<i>&gt; Hi again,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now that you have all had an opportunity to ponder the practice</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions, here is the real thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are SDAs evangelical, without knowing it ?</i><br>
	Some of us are, some of us aint.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Should we all just be Seventh Day Baptists ?</i><br>
	NO!<br>
	They don't accept Christ's special message to the last day church,<br>
	the Spirit of Prophecy.<br>
<p>
	They dont't accept The work of Christ in the Sanctuary above and<br>
	the human Sanctuary on earth.<br>
<p>
	They don't accept Christ's special message of health.<br>
<p>
	I guess I should change my NO.  If you feel that the SDB church<br>
	is closer to the truth.  Go on.  Was this meant to remain unaswered?<br>
<p>
Let us not fear to hold some of the beliefs that some<br>
evangelicals  hold.  Also let us not fear to  hold some beliefs that they<br>
do not hold, or may even find heretical.  Let us seek to follow truth<br>
whoever may agree or disagree.<br>
<p>
One time I was in a discussion.  I agreed with someone who I usually<br>
did not.  One of my friends told me you need o to really think when You<br>
agree with that person.  My reesponse was, "If the Devil himself<br>
came  here and said that commiting adultury<br>
is wrong I would agree with him."<br>
<p>
Let us stand up for truth.  Some will agree some will not.  In fact, some<br>
will say it is conservative, some will say it is liberal.<br>
<p>
bye<br>

I have a question regarding the place of the United States of America in<br>
Prophecy.  Our present, traditional view holds that america is a lamb-like<br>
beast who will talk like a dragon.  Would we say it is a Beast, or it will<br>
become a beast.<br>

<i>&gt; The other alternative is that this passage may be designed to allow Baptists</i><br>
<i>&gt; to believe in "thought inspiration" without feeling that they have violated</i><br>
<i>&gt; their articles of faith. Does this summarize the position of the SDAs who</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe in verbal inspiration, do you think, or do they believe the </i><br>
<i>&gt; scriptures were dictated?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I personally have never met any SDA who believes in dictation.<br>
<p>
I'm curious what's the third alternative, you have dictation, thought<br>
inspiration and what ? what other type of inspiration can there be ?<br>
<p>
Is there some other type ? If anybody has any ideas I'd be interested<br>
in hearing them<br>

<p>
Wow!  I just checked out how much it costs to connect to AARNet as an<br>
"affiliate member".  (AARNet is the Australian Academic and Research<br>
Network, the body which manages Internet connections in Australia.<br>
Non-academic institutions can gain access as affiliate members.)<br>
<p>
NB: All costs given below are in AUSTRALIAN dollars unless indicated.<br>
<p>
Mail-only access starts at $1000/year, stepping up to $4000/year if you<br>
are considered a "high volume user" (over 4Mbytes/month).<br>
<p>
Full Internet access depends on how you connect:<br>
<p>
$5,000 p.a.     dial in at 9.6Kbps or lower<br>
$8,000 p.a.     9.6Kbps capacity - leased line or permanent call<br>
$15,000 p.a.    19.2Kbps  capacity  -  leased  line or permanent call<br>
$25,000 p.a.    48Kbps capacity<br>
$30,000 p.a.    64Kbps capacity<br>
$45,000 p.a.    2Mb capacity<br>
<p>
This buys you the connection rights, you still would have to pay for<br>
your leased line and terminal equipment on top of this.  I'm not<br>
certain how much this would be, but it seems to me to be rather<br>
competitive with $US1700/month in terms of what you can get for your<br>
money.<br>
<p>
There are also at least two commercial email services in Australia, and<br>
a few public access bodies that provide some access.<br>

<i>&gt;calling them "droids").  </i><br>
<p>
Do I detect a gentle flame?  My step-mother happens to work at the<br>
South Pacific Division.  Her official job title is "secretary", but in<br>
actual fact, about 10% of her work involves what would be described as<br>
secretarial duties anywhere else.  Hence, we prefer to call her an<br>
executive consultant.  So I'm no stranger to the plight of secretaries<br>
in our institutions.<br>
<p>
I could also defend myself by saying that I was applying the term to<br>
White House staff, but I suspect that wouldn't help my case.  Regardless,<br>
I unreservedly apologise if anyone found the term insulting.<br>

Well I didn't see anything wrong with what was there (although I am a bit<br>
uncomfortable about the universal church bit).  I am not sure if this is a<br>
reflection of the typical SDA as I have only been an SDA for a few years. <br>
I am also unsure what problem might exist if these were a typical SDA<br>
UNLESS this was a reflection of the only things that they see as truths<br>
emminating from the scriptures.  The items that bring me into conflict<br>
with evangelicals (state of the dead, fate of the wicked, the judgment,<br>
the Sabbath and the moral law, etc.) are important also.<br>

[From Sherman Cox]<br>
The other day I was reading in Counsels to Writers and Editors.  <br>
<p>
People were attacking Jones and Waggoner saying they were attacking<br>
the landmarks of the church.  Ellen White made an interesting statement.<br>
<p>
She said the landmarks of the church were:<br>
<p>
	1. Sabbath<br>
	2. Snactuary<br>
	3. Law of God<br>
	4. Noinmortality of the wicked.<br>
<p>
	I formget the order it was in.  She said beside these she could think<br>
	of no other.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; First of all we know that the AntiChrist is not someone who is openly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; antagonistic to Jesus and Christianity because thats what the word means :</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't follow your logic here...why does it follow that AntiChrist</i><br>
means not openly<br>
<i>&gt; antagonistic to Christ?  To me, to be against someone is very likely to mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; antagonism towards that person.</i><br>
<p>
The operative word is "openly"<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; As Malcolm stated, where do you draw the line as to what is truth and</i><br>
what isn't?<br>
<p>
Well I always thought that God's Word was the test of truth.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; then arise where what was revealed as truth to one person has not been</i><br>
revealed to<br>
<i>&gt; the other person, therefore according to your definition of the</i><br>
AntiChrist, the list<br>
<i>&gt; of what is AntiChrist varies from person to person. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
No, I'd didn't say that, you have "interpreted that" I did not give any method<br>
for detecting AntiChrist, except as it is revealed in scripture.<br>
<p>
However spiritual discernment in accordance with scripture does vary from<br>
person to person, this doesn't mean different things are AntiChrist, or that<br>
AntiChrist "Dynamically varies" it means some may perceive it while others <br>
don't.<br>
<p>
In fact I actually liked Marcuss' understanding of the matter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; earth.  But I can't say what or who the antiChrist is or when it will</i><br>
appear or if it<br>
<i>&gt; has or hasn't appeared yet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
But I can because the scripture tells me how to identify the AntiChrist quite<br>
clearly. <br>

Steve,<br>
<p>
I think the internet services provided by telnet/ftp/talk are important, quite<br>
above and beyond e-mail.  Joining the internet will be moderately expenisve,<br>
and Folkenberg, et al, need to see just what is happening with the schools,<br>
'cuz NREN is going to be a basis for most academies and colleges and even<br>
one-room schools to communicate...  The conferences need to be in on this,<br>
if for no other reason than education departments consume the vast majority<br>
of conference budget/time/etc. That in turn argues for union/division level<br>
commitment, etc.  Its also a good way to communicate/share globally.<br>
<p>
Thus my query as to whether CUC is really on the net, since the GC<br>
obviously isn't...  It would also help to get the MIS types from a large<br>
number of conferences/unions present, since many of them are supporting<br>
far-flung s/w empires, etc.<br>
<p>
Frankly, I'd guess we could get more than a hundred warm bodies together<br>
without trying very hard, even with the fiscal crises all around.<br>
<p>
<p>
[As mentioned here before, CUC's connection is a mail-only connection,<br>
even though they have a domain address.  SCT]<br>

This phenomenon has always been with us, but in recent years it seems to be<br>
increasing in numbers.  I speak of people who are not members of the <br>
Seventh-day Adventist church, and yet attend church services regularly, more<br>
so than some of the members.  In many cases they are fully integrated into <br>
the social life, and sometimes even the ministry of the church.<br>
<p>
There are two major reasons I can discern that these people come to the SDA <br>
church.<br>
<p>
1)  Assent to the doctrine of the Sabbath but not to other parts of SDA <br>
teachings.  <br>
<p>
2)  Following a spouse and/or children that are members of the church.<br>
<p>
Are there others?  Does this phenomenon show that Adventists are starting <br>
to put more stress on *belong* and less on *believe* and *behave*?  <br>

<i>&gt;What follows is a Doctrinal Basis of Evangelical Belief.  It is a summary of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the Christian faith, and is used by Christian Unions which are affiliated</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the Universities' and Colleges' Christian Fellowship (U.C.C.F.), which is</i><br>
<i>&gt;the United Kindom affiliate of the International Fellowship of Evangelical</i><br>
<i>&gt;Students (I.F.E.S.).</i><br>
<p>
Well, i am a member of the Varsity Christian Fellowship, which is affliated<br>
to IFES, so i've seen this list of beliefs before. I must say that i agree<br>
with all of it, and am glad that there are still many Christians who hold<br>
these beliefs, in this day and age, when all sorts of ridiculous (for want<br>
of a better word) ideas are being taught as the doctrines of God.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No here comes the tricky bit. </i><br>
<p>
Where?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Does this sound any different from your average SDA these days ? Yes or no. </i><br>
<p>
Well, i hope the average SDA these days, or any days, for that matter,<br>
believes all of these teachings, for the are sound Christrian principles,<br>
from God's own word. Of course, the SDA church has a more in-depth body of<br>
knowledge on many biblical teachings, our understanding of the relationship<br>
between the law, sin, grace, faith, salvation, the ministry of Christ and<br>
other things is much richer and clearer and makes a lot more sense than what<br>
a lot of other people have. As such, SDAs can more fully appreciate the<br>
beauty and trueness of these truths.<br>
	As such, i would hope that the average SDA holds all the beliefs in<br>
the Evengelical list at least as strongly, if not more so, than most of the<br>
other churches.<br>
	I don't mean to sound arrogant or boastful (though i know it sounds<br>
that way) but that is what i think.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Is anything wrong with it ? yes or no. (if yes what)</i><br>
<p>
Well, i can't think of anything wrong with it, though i tried.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Will all the evangelicals who believe the above be saved ? Yes or No (why)</i><br>
<p>
Who knows. People are not saved by professing a creed alone. God is merciful<br>
and righteous, and he will judge each individual according to the light he<br>
has been given, and at the end of the day, it is God who saves us all, after<br>
all. God knows his own.<br>

<i>&gt;Are SDAs evangelical, without knowing it ?</i><br>

<i>&gt;Should we all just be Seventh Day Baptists ?</i><br>
<p>
Well, i've seen the SDA church defined in a cyclopaedia as:<br>
<p>
Seventh-day Adventists: an evangelical Prostant denomination observing the<br>
divinely ordained Seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth commandment rather than<br>
the first day of the week, for which there is no Biblical authority, and<br>
ardently looking for the second comming of Christ to right all earth's<br>
wrongs.<br>
<p>
-Pears Cyclopaedia, 65th edition, page 679<br>
<p>
(I think that is a very good definition, especially coming from a non-SDA<br>
source) So i always thought we were evangelical Prostetants. Recently<br>
though, i've heard talk that we're not evangelicals and we're not<br>
Protestants (or Papists for that matter), but it doesn't really matter to<br>
me. I suppose it depends on what you take these words to mean. After all,<br>
God knows, we are what we are, no matter what we're called. The Methodists<br>
got that name because people called them names, and that was one of them,<br>
the quakers got called that because of their quaking, others got their names<br>
from their founders. What does it matter anyhow. Well, i hope we live up to<br>
our name.<br>

<i>&gt; Interestingly, I read an article yesterday from a recent issue of Time</i><br>
<i>&gt; magazine, which describes many of the emergency governance plans that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; U.S. had prepared in case of a nuclear strike by the former Soviet Union. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The plans called for measures that severely curtailed many of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; dearly-held constitutional rights.  To me, the article was a striking</i><br>
<i>&gt; reminder, despite the apparently solidity of our governmental</i><br>
<i>&gt; institutions and our freedoms, of how precarious our rights as</i><br>
<i>&gt; American citizens really are.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I have read such articles  also, but I have also read about actions taken by <br>
the US government to systematically destroy groups not only during war but<br>
during times of peace.<br>
<p>
An example is the American Civil Rights Movement.  This movement was bugged, <br>
brought in on false charges until individualsran out of money for bail, and<br>
rivalries were stirred up between the groups.  This was all done under a<br>
program called COINTELPRO.  This was the FBI's program.  Even the peace<br>
loving Dr. Martin Luther King was not immune to these tactics.<br>
If any one wants  documentation for  these charges e-mail me for I do not<br>
think this is the place to talk any more about  this.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In a time of "national emergency," the lamb becomes a dragon in a matter</i><br>
<i>&gt; of hours and a "lifeboat" mentality kicks in.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
It is good that you put "national emergency" in quotes, for any time can  be<br>
a national emergency and it can occur during times of peace even to peace<br>
loving groups.  As for America talking like a dragon, she has done  so in<br>
the past, ask blacks and Native Americans.  She will do so again, ask SDAs.<br>
<p>
I do not want to sound anti-american, for our standardof living is great.   Oourfreedoms are definitely higher  than the vast amount of the world.  Some would<br>
say it is the highest, but let us not fool ourselves.  If you make the wrong<br>
people mad, for whatever reason, you can have major problems.<br>

Those few subscribers at Andrews who don't already know me  (most are<br>
former professors and instructors of mine) are welcome to drop in on the<br>
Physics <br>
Dept. Assembly at 10:30 on April 2, where I will be speaking.  Also<br>
I will be in the physics department for "Physics On Rye" at 12:30.<br>
I would be interested in meeting the various subscribers, although by instinct<br>
I will still look for the computers in the science complex rather than the <br>
school of business.<br>
<p>
If one considers the connectivity of AU in my day (a BBS and a modem)<br>
and considers how far they have come in 5 years, it's amazing.<br>

<p>
Sorry, what is a CB ?  I forgot.<br>
Anyway, to that person, i'd say that there is seldom, if ever, only exactly<br>
one way to define something, especially a concept like sin. This is because<br>
different people see it from different perspectives and emphasize different<br>
facets of it. All the views might be correct, albeit they be views beheld<br>
from different angles, because the thing being defined is always there, the<br>
same thing.<br>
	So, sin is "the transgression of the law" but also, "whatsoever is<br>
not of faith is sin" and "The sting of death is sin" and "all wrongdoing<br>
(unrighteousness) is sin and there is sin not unto death" and "sin is a<br>
reproach to any people"<br>
	Actually, most definitions of things, if they are good ones, will not<br>
contradict each other, when properly understood.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How very true.</i><br>
<p>
How true indeed. Ok then, what is sin?<br>
Is sin an act to be committed? Is it a state of being? On who does the blame<br>
for sin fall? Who is to be held accountable, and under what circumstances?<br>
<p>
These are quite important, as the idea of salvation depends on the idea of<br>
sin to be saved from.<br>
<p>
I'll leave you all to think about it.<br>

<p>
Troublers of Zion: There are in our churches those who profess the truth who<br>
are only hinderances to the work of reform. They are clogs to the wheels of<br>
the car of salvation. This class are frequently in trial. Doubts, jealousies<br>
and suspicion are the fruits of selfishness, and seem to be interwoven with<br>
their very natures. I shall name this class chronic church grumblers. They<br>
do more harm in a church than 2 ministers can undo. They are a tax to the<br>
church and a great weight to the ministers of Christ. They live in an<br>
atmosphere of doubts, jealousies, and surmisings.  Much time and labour of<br>
the ambassadors of Christ are required to undo their work of evil, and<br>
restore harmony and union in the church. This takes from the courage and<br>
strength of God's servants and unfits them for the work He has for them to<br>
do in saving perishing souls from ruin. God will reward these troublers of<br>
Zion according to their works.<br>
     The ministers of Christ should take their position, and not be<br>
hindered in their work by these agents of Satan. There will be enough of<br>
these to question, and quibble, and criticize, to keep the ministers of God<br>
constantly busy, if they will allow themselves to be detained from the great<br>
work of giving the last saving message of warning to the world. If the<br>
church has no strength to stand against the unsanctified, rebellious<br>
feelings of church grumblers, it is better to let church and grumblers go<br>
overboard together than lose the opportunity of saving hundreds who would<br>
make better churches, and have the elements existing within themselves of<br>
strength and union and power.<br>
     The very best way for ministers and churches is to let this faultfinding,<br>
crooked class fall back into their own element, and pull away from the shore,<br>
launch out into the deep, and cast out the gospel net again for fish that may<br>
pay for the labour bestowed upon them.  Satan exults when men and women<br>
embrace the truth who are naturally faultfinding and who will throw all the<br>
darkness and hinderance they can against the advancement of the work of God.<br>
Ministers cannot now in this important period of the work be detained to prop<br>
up men and women who see and have felt once the force of truth. They should<br>
fasten believing Christians on Christ, who is able to hold them up and preserve them<br>
blameless unto His appearing, while they go forth to new fields of labour.<br>

I have not attended a Aron &amp; Hur club sermon yet.  Its sweeping through<br>
this conference.  The emphasis seems to be on Moses being the pastor<br>
and Aron and Hur the church members.  Club membership equates to<br>
supporting your local pastor (and conference).  And so its not<br>
appropriate for the pastor to preach the sermon.<br>
<p>
But, my wife has been studying the topic from EGW.<br>
<p>
 Moses -- the prophet with his arms reaching out to God.<br>
<p>
 Aron  -- the ordained ministry (priesthood).<br>
<p>
 Hur   -- the laymen of the church (one of the artisans).<br>
<p>
A big reason for starting up these clubs is to try and get people<br>
to quit complaining about the pastors no longer supporting EGW, or<br>
serious Bible truths.  The idea is that the pastor should be free<br>
to preach anything he wants without getting hassled.  But the real<br>
symbolism seems to be quite the opposite.<br>

In my understanding of it, a beast in prophecy represents a world power,<br>
and therefore America is currently a "lamb-like beast" that, according to<br>
Revelation, is destined to become a dragon-like beast.  <br>
<p>
Interestingly, I read an article yesterday from a recent issue of Time<br>
magazine, which describes many of the emergency governance plans that the<br>
U.S. had prepared in case of a nuclear strike by the former Soviet Union. <br>
The plans called for measures that severely curtailed many of our<br>
dearly-held constitutional rights.  To me, the article was a striking<br>
reminder, despite the apparently solidity of our governmental<br>
institutions and our freedoms, of how precarious our rights as<br>
American citizens really are.<br>
<p>
In a time of "national emergency," the lamb becomes a dragon in a matter<br>
of hours and a "lifeboat" mentality kicks in.<br>

Bill Allen:<br>
I spent three years on the campus of *Southern College of SDAs*<br>
as academic v.p.  I came away from the experience with the belief<br>
that if those conservatives treated people they way they<br>
did, their theology must be flawed.<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
Ahh!  A fellow refugee!  When did you escape? = )<br>
<p>
You know, I wondered if I was the only one to come<br>
away from that place shaking my head - trying to make<br>
what I was being told Christians are supposed to be,<br>
"compatible" with what I read about how Jesus treated<br>
people.  I pray (for the sake of kids there now), that<br>
things have changed.<br>
<p>
It is true, that by our fruit, others will know who we are.<br>

<i>&gt;I found very interesting Harvey's comments about the general lack of knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the Internet on the part of GC "men."  This corresponds with what I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have seen in the past ten years among SDAs in general -- that is, either a</i><br>
<i>&gt;distrust in or a lack of committment toward new computer technologies. </i><br>
.<br>
.<br>
<i>&gt;Have those of you on SDANet had similar experiences?</i><br>

I am the Microcomputer Services Manager at Andrews University.  We run a<br>
computer store and provide hardware and software support services on<br>
campus.  It has been my observation that students in the Seminary here tend<br>
to be far more computer literate than the graduate student population in<br>
general.  It is quite common to find MDiv students who own portable<br>
computers and cart them around along with their textbooks.  I cannot<br>
comment on what percentage of the Seminary student body this might amount<br>
to but I'm quite certain it's large relative to other student sub groups.<br>
<p>
I've also noticed a similar trend among Seminary faculty.  They seem to get<br>
further beyond the word processing stage than the faculty population in<br>
general, excepting of course Computer Science, Physical Sciences and others<br>
where computers are quite integral.<br>
<p>
The reason I point this out as regards the GC etc. is that I've noticed a<br>
large number GC officiary are Andrews alumni by virtue of the Seminary<br>
being here.  Assuming this trend will continue (perhaps an invalid<br>
assumption), I would say that in about 20 years the GC brass will be fairly<br>
computer literate.  This will probably be about 10 years after the top<br>
management at most major corporations is computer literate.  I suspect<br>
administrative aversion to technology will subside sometime before this<br>
time.  I believed it was mentioned earlier in this thread that the U.S.<br>
government (at least in the White House) also suffers from this problem.<br>

The cover story in this week's TIME magazine (April 5, 1993, pp. 45-49)<br>
concerns the return to "religion" on the part of thousands of "Baby<br>
boomers," who, according to the article, had dropped out of church in the<br>
late 60s and on through to the 80s.  <br>
<p>
I read the article with great interest, since it certainly touches on<br>
trends and attitudes that are affecting the Seventh-day Adventist Church.<br>
<p>
The article notes that "increasing numbers of baby boomers who left the<br>
fold years ago are turning religious again, but many are traveling from<br>
church to church or faith to faith, sampling creeds, shopping for a<br>
custom-made God" (p. 45).<br>
<p>
The authors point out that as more and more churches put "marketing<br>
strategies" into effect aimed at luring these baby boomers into their fold<br>
the churches "are at risk of losing their heritage--and their souls" (p. 46).<br>
<p>
According to the article, the baby boomers are most often drawn back to<br>
church by one of two things: (1) having children, or (2) facing a mid-life<br>
personal or career crisis.<br>
<p>
Further, the authors mention that church membership rates between 1965 and<br>
1989 indicate that the "old-line Protestant churches" are rapidly losing<br>
members, whereas the "evangelical churches" (with which the SDAs are<br>
included) have gained considerably.  SDA membership has grown by 92% since<br>
1965, a growth rate exceeded only by the Assemblies of God (121%), the<br>
Mormons (133%), and the Church of God (183%).<br>
<p>
One final interesting quote from the article:  "Though strict, doctrinaire<br>
religion might seem to drive away the tolerance-minded boomers, liberalism<br>
fares even worse.  When the faith replaces firm claims to truth with a<br>
spongy, homemade folk religion, younger members seem to take it as an<br>
invitation to look elsewhere" (p. 47).  The authors conclude that although<br>
the boomers might want flexibility in their worship, they definitely also<br>
want some well-defined moral and religious boundaries.<br>
<p>
I find this last observation of special interest in view of some recent<br>
pressures for the SDA church to "relax" some of our standards in order to<br>
reach out to groups like the boomers.<br>

<i>&gt; I don't think there is much at first glance that is strikingly</i><br>
<i>&gt; objectionable about the evangelical beliefs.  Ruben asks if all the</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
A verse comes to mind that says something to the effect that<br>
its not what you believe in itself that is sufficient for salvation.<br>
You know the one in the book of James.<br>

<i>&gt;From: ruben@ee.uts.edu.au (Ruben Gonzalez)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subject: RE: How to answer a CB</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Your entire theology stands or falls on your definition</i><br>
<i>&gt;of sin, if you chose one definition one would do well to see where it leads.</i><br>
<i>&gt;In one case it leads to things such as the immaculate conception and child</i><br>
<i>&gt;baptism etc. In the other it leads to victory over sin.</i><br>
<p>
I'm really not happy with this assumption that child baptism results from<br>
an understanding of sin. Were the SDA church to decide that sin was definately<br>
not "the transgression of the law" only but instead "a broken relationship<br>
with God"/"an internal state"/etc we would still _never_ end up having<br>
child baptism. So I feel I have to reject that statement outright.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How about we all sit down with ZERO presumptions and ask God to lead</i><br>
<i>&gt;our study of His Word, to find out the truth, not to gather arguments</i><br>
<i>&gt;but to really seek truth, with a willing mind to leave aside any cherished</i><br>
<i>&gt;interpretation that is not clearly supported by scripture. God will lead</i><br>
<i>&gt;and teach those who are willing to be taught of Him.</i><br>
<p>
I had a Sabbath School teacher a few years ago who taught our youth class<br>
in no uncertain terms that the Holy Spirit would lead all people who studied<br>
the Bible to the truth. And regardless of how many people honestly studied <br>
the Bible, they would all come up with the same conclusions due to the leading<br>
of the Holy Spirit.<br>
But what if they don't?<br>
Well "obviously" someone is not being lead by the Holy Spirit!<br>
<p>
The reality of the situation is that there *are* differences in what <br>
people discover - and to the observer it seems impossible to distinguish<br>
WHICH of these people is lead by the Holy Spirit and WHICH is not! (The<br>
worst thing being when a group of people decide that anyone not of their<br>
exact persuasion is of Satan/or something equally terrible and start a<br>
cleansing campaign.) Suppose the Holy Spirit leads them both?<br>
<p>
How do we resolve this dilemma?<br>

<i>&gt;From: bruceh@wv.mentorg.com (Bruce Holm)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subject: RE:  Maxwell's letter</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also find it very sad that the church (conference) leadership can not see </i><br>
<i>&gt;to it</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the pastors be placed in a district for more than a couple years.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Studies have</i><br>
<i>&gt;shown that a pastor's effectiveness begins after about 5 years, about the </i><br>
<i>&gt;time that</i><br>
<i>&gt;he is usually moved.</i><br>
<p>
I have an Uncle who has been in a church for &gt; 10 yrs and seems to be doing<br>
OK. He's built a new church and really progressed. I really do think it is<br>
a good idea for pastors to be in a place for a longer period - even for the<br>
development of social roots etc for their family.<br>
<p>
But we probably should be a bit careful to assess the affectiveness of our<br>
pastors periodically and say "great job" if doing well, sympathize if going<br>
through a hard patch, and "smarten up" if required. I heard that an<br>
independant review had to assess a number of churches over here recently.<br>
Lots of pastors had bought their houses and settled down planning for their<br>
retirement - and effectively retired from anything but maintaining the<br>
status quo in their churches. Now is that sad or what?<br>

<p>
<p>
It depends who you are, to some it means concerned bretheren, to others<br>
it means converted bretheren ;^).<br>
<p>
Basically over here its what you label anybody that is conserative,<br>
ie a historic Adventist, and it is by no means complmentary.<br>

<i>&gt; I found very interesting Harvey's comments about the general lack of knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the Internet on the part of GC "men."  This corresponds with what I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have seen in the past ten years among SDAs in general -- that is, either a</i><br>
<i>&gt; distrust in or a lack of committment toward new computer technologies. </i><br>
My impression is today a little different at the GC-level, I know at union level<br>
I have been persuading electronic mail now for some ten years, and have 3 users<br>
now in the Finnish union using (somehow) email!<br>
Br Folkenberg is using - so I understand quite extesiviely email. During his journeys<br>
journeys he writes his report in the hotel and sends them with his PC to his<br>
secretary, and receives from her his calender. Ray Dabrowski in TED has a email<br>
account, and Folkenbergs plan is to have at least all division presidents <br>
connected to email.<br>

	Perhaps I've been more fortunate than one should reasonably<br>
expect, but almost all of my experience in universities has approached<br>
the ideals of a community of scholars seeking after truth.  Indeed,<br>
I hold that ideal even higher for church-related institutions, and<br>
thus for the faculty, staff and students who are the institution.  <br>
This has always seemed logical to me for both the church and the<br>
university are institutions, associations of people, dedicated to<br>
the pursuit of truth.<br>
<p>
	For the foregoing reason, among others, I was terribly disapointed<br>
to receive a copy of electronic mail sent by "Bill Allen" (according to<br>
the EM address) was was disparaging of his faculty colleagues, as well<br>
as all of the rest of us who serve on the presidential search committee<br>
for La Sierra University.  <br>
<p>
	Without checking his <br>
"facts" with any mmeber of the committee, least of all with its chair-<br>
person, he complained about "secrecy" and asserted that the committee<br>
was on "a short leash and a muzzle."  The fact that the entire membership<br>
of the committee, which is composed of faculty, trustees, an administrator,<br>
and an alumnus, discussed the benefits and burdens of a "closed" process<br>
versus and "open" process as to the names of persons nominated and those<br>
who were willing to become candidates, and voted unanimously for the<br>
closed process as the better for a private SDA institution.  The process<br>
was and is absolutely open to anyone to make a nomination, and all 52<br>
persons nominated have been invited to become candidates by their<br>
choosing to submit resumes.  It is an inclusive process, but we have<br>
no desire to harm the work of people in their present positions by<br>
announcing either that they've been nominated or that they've become<br>
candidates for there can be only one president.  I'd go on, but I'm<br>
not trying to list all of the reasons for choosing the methodology we<br>
chose, rather to illustrate that if "Bill Allen" had been searching<br>
for truth he might have discovered that the committee has/had good<br>
reasons for choosing the process even if he disagreed with our decision.<br>
<p>
	As to the line "has been removed from the committee," the<br>
person in question resigned.<br>
<p>
	As a former newspaper person, I've always preferred named<br>
sources to "authoritative information coming from off campus," and<br>
in the educational setting this seems so out of the character of our<br>
enterprise.  His assertion is simply wrong.  He seems to believe<br>
that his faculty colleagues on the committee, the outside trustees<br>
(those of us who are not employed by the denomination), the alumnus,<br>
would all be puppets lending our names to a decision made by<br>
Big Brother (not likely Big Sister presently).  That is demeaning<br>
to the individuals involved, indeed, it is defamatory.  Anyone<br>
who believes women and men of goodwill, strong convictions, and<br>
lively intellect can be so easily either manipulated or muzzled<br>
misjudges badly both the people and how one gets the best from<br>
good people.  <br>
<p>
	Dr. Larry Geraty did visit LSU.  He has a marvelous c.v.,<br>
and excellent administrative experience.  He is an outstanding<br>
scholar who has managed to make the transition to administration<br>
while holding fast to his scholarly ideals.  The committee was<br>
pleased he wanted to visit the campus.  Somehow I think "Bill<br>
Allen" wants us to apologize for our invitation to Dr. Geraty.<br>
On the contrary, we think the invitation quite justifiable.<br>
<p>
	Thanks for reading, if you struggled thro' the typos<br>
and the long reply.  This mail package, which is temporary,<br>
doesn't brook editing.<br>

While doing some painting recently, I was chatting with a fellow church<br>
member whose son was until recently in my Jr SS class.  I complimented him<br>
on having a son who seemed tho'tful and genuinely interested in<br>
spiritual things.  The father then replied that the son really wanted<br>
to be baptized but they had as yet been unable to schedule something<br>
with the Pastor.  I recommended that they just get lessons from the ABC<br>
and do it themselves (Deu 6:7, 11:19; cf Ex 12:26, Deu 6:20, Josh 4:6,21).<br>
The surprised father said, "You mean I could?"  Absolutely!<br>
<p>
I'd like to highly recommend, from the joys we have experienced in our<br>
family, to take every opportunity possible to bring the things of God<br>
into conversation with your children.  Be alert to occasions when such<br>
can be woven ever so naturally into the fabric of life's circumstances.<br>
To see God's hand in nature, to see His hand in their lives.  To depend upon<br>
His promises, to experience His peace in the midst of a storm, to grasp<br>
His hand in faith when logic would suggest otherwise (Heb 11:6).  And, yes,<br>
in giving the heart to God, accepting Christ as Savior and Lord, and<br>
inviting the in-dwelling Holy Spirit.  And, certainly, in preparing for<br>
baptism, the public commitment to follow Jesus as our Example in everything.<br>

Ok Now I'll tell you all what I think.<br>
<p>
Generally I found them quite good although a bit hazy in some areas, here <br>
are some particular comments<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; d       The universal sinfulness and guilt of human nature since the </i><br>
<i>&gt;         fall, rendering man subject to God's wrath and condemnation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
This one is too hazy, does this mean guilt as a direct consequence <br>
of Adam's fall, or as an consequece of our sinful acts since the fall ?<br>
You can't have it both ways.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; e       The full deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God; His</i><br>
<i>&gt;         virgin birth and His real and sinless humanity; His death on the </i><br>
<i>&gt;         cross, His bodily resurrection and His present reign in heaven and</i><br>
<i>&gt;         earth.</i><br>
<p>
But Jesus doesn't rein on this earth (ecept in our hearts ) that will only <br>
happen after the 2nd coming the prince of this world is Lucifer, thats why <br>
suffering and death abounds.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; f       Redemption from guilt, penalty and power of sin only through the </i><br>
<i>&gt;         sacrificial death once and for all time of our representative and </i><br>
<i>&gt;         substitute, Jesus Christ, the only mediator between God and man.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Redemptiomn from guild through His death, power over sin through<br>
His resurrection. No resurrection no redemption. Why do some only focus<br>
on His death, Its His life which makes His death of any value. Paul basically <br>
says no resurrection, no salvation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; i       The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in all those thus regenerated, </i><br>
<i>&gt;         producing in them an increasing likeness to Christ in character and </i><br>
<i>&gt;         behaviour, and empowering them for their witness in the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Why is it when we say that we are labelled as legalistic CB's ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; j       The one holy universal Church, which is the Body of Christ, and to </i><br>
<i>&gt;         which all true believers belong.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It depends on what this exactly means, ok at face value.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Will all the evangelicals who believe the above be saved ? Yes or No (why)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The point about this last question is that believing all of the above<br>
of itself is useless, because I'm certain the devil believes all of that<br>
and much more. Some christians have the idea that belief is all thats<br>
required for salvation. Not so, the life must be in conformity with<br>
the beliefs otherwise the belief is of no effect.<br>
<p>
The question was not meant to be an excuse to sit back and self-righteously<br>
declare all nonSDAs "unclean". Rather it was a point of reflection about<br>
how we view salvation in terms of our belief system. Salvation is always<br>
at an individual level so the answer is NO, not ALL who believe the above<br>
will be saved, what about those who say Lord, Lord we have believed in you ?<br>
Only God knows who will be saved.<br>

<i>&gt; I'm really not happy with this assumption that child baptism results from</i><br>
<i>&gt; an understanding of sin. Were the SDA church to decide that sin was definately</i><br>
<i>&gt; not "the transgression of the law" only but instead "a broken relationship</i><br>
<i>&gt; with God"/"an internal state"/etc we would still _never_ end up having</i><br>
<i>&gt; child baptism. So I feel I have to reject that statement outright.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Well here's how it works, (for the RCC at least). You are born guilty<br>
of original sin / separate from God / internally at variance with God/ what<br>
ever you like. Now being in this state means that if you die before this<br>
guilt / rebellion / whatever is removed then you die guilty and condemned<br>
to destruction. Accordingly Baptism, which symbolises the removal of the<br>
severed relationship / guilt / you get the idea is a necessary component<br>
for salvation. In this case rather than let a baby die while still guilty<br>
it is better to baptise it and in that way remove the stain due to Adam's<br>
sin.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I had a Sabbath School teacher a few years ago who taught our youth class</i><br>
<i>&gt; in no uncertain terms that the Holy Spirit would lead all people who studied</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Bible to the truth. And regardless of how many people honestly studied </i><br>
<i>&gt; the Bible, they would all come up with the same conclusions due to the leading</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the Holy Spirit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But what if they don't?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well "obviously" someone is not being lead by the Holy Spirit!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It is one thing to study, and quite another thing to Study !<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The reality of the situation is that there *are* differences in what </i><br>
<i>&gt; people discover - and to the observer it seems impossible to distinguish</i><br>
<i>&gt; WHICH of these people is lead by the Holy Spirit and WHICH is not! (The</i><br>
<i>&gt; worst thing being when a group of people decide that anyone not of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; exact persuasion is of Satan/or something equally terrible and start a</i><br>
<i>&gt; cleansing campaign.) Suppose the Holy Spirit leads them both?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
The H.S leads you into truth and unity, it is impossible for the H.S. to lead<br>
two people to opposite conclusions, the scripture confirms this.<br>
<p>
The H.S may not reveal all the truth to everyone at the same time, He leads<br>
as each indivdual is able to bear, this accounts for some differences of<br>
opinion. It is not correct to say that the H.S. has lead to different <br>
conclusions though. Other differences arise due to placing the <br>
wisdom of man (in whatever context) before the Word of God.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How do we resolve this dilemma?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
With much study, prayer and fasting, like our church founders did.<br>

1.	I noticed at the top of the evangelical statement of beliefs the<br>
	word "including". After reading the statement of beliefs and not<br>
	particularly disagreeing with any of the points, I considered that<br>
	any SDA should be able to agree with that list subject to that<br>
	word "including" which was at the top. Most SDAs would wish to add<br>
	a couple of things to the list.<br>
<p>
2.	As Ruben said in a subsequent post, it is not what you believe in<br>
	itself that is sufficient for salvation, so that provides an easy<br>
	"no" to the question "will all ... who believe the above be saved."<br>
<p>
3.	I still believe that it is "relationship", not "doctrine" that<br>
        is the crux of Christianity. And no, this does *not* equate to<br>
	antinomianism or anything similar. The very act of confessing known<br>
	sins to God every day assists in the process of leaving those things<br>
	behind. I think it would be fair to say that any person who confesses<br>
	things to Jesus specifically, with honesty and frankness, will be<br>
	disappointed that they are not living up to His standards. Do we<br>
	believe that the Holy Spirit can transform an "unknown sin" into a<br>
	"known sin"?<br>
<p>
 From my understanding of SDA beliefs, it is the traumatic events immediately<br>
preceding Christ's return that will settle the matter of who is and who is<br>
not truly loyal to Him. It seems a little premature to be looking around now<br>
and asking who will and will not be saved. I firmly believe that there are<br>
many true disciples of Christ in all kinds of various situations, many of<br>
whom we may consider to be quite misled in some of their beliefs. Some of<br>
those people are currently performing a powerful ministry spreading the<br>
news about Christ, and they may be better off staying where they are.<br>
<p>
I don't think we SDAs should lose our distinctive beliefs or our sense of<br>
mission, but I do think our hostility towards other members of God's family<br>
could be toned down or even turned off. The more I read, the more people<br>
I talk to, and the longer I am on SDAnet, the more I am convinced that the<br>
differences within the SDA church are far more related to approach,<br>
attitude and priorities than anything else.<br>
<p>
I might explain further sometime, but this post is long enough already!<br>
btw, thank you all who have replied to my questions regarding the three<br>
angels' messages. All responses have been appreciated!<br>

Most of us Aussies only use the term CB to refer to that group of ultra-<br>
conservative SDAs who are active in criticizing church leadership and<br>
church institutions in an aggressive and damaging way. There are many<br>
conservative SDAs here who have sympathies with, or even support, the<br>
various groups of CBs, but would not themselves attract that label.<br>
<p>
No, the label is by no means complimentary, but neither are the CBs a lot<br>
of the time. I think most of you would have met negative, critical conservative<br>
SDAs as well as positive, helpful and constructive conservative SDAs. <br>
<p>
I'm not sure what the label is for a negative, critical liberal SDA, but<br>
I've met some of those too!<br>

At my local congregation we have had the privilege of having a young couple<br>
worshiping with us who are from the Church of God, 7th Day.  They came to<br>
Austin because he is working on a PhD at the University of Texas and chose<br>
to worship with us because the local COG, 7th Day is a Spanish speaking<br>
group and they liked the friendly reception they recieved.  They have become<br>
involved in the music and social life of the church.<br>
<p>
I have known some other cases where spouses of members where so involved in<br>
church life, that when they finally decided to be baptized and become members<br>
some people were suprised that they were not already members.<br>
<p>
I don't know that this represents any shift in adventist culture, but I see<br>
it as something positive for both the members and the "visitors".<br>

I am relatively new to the SDA church.  I became interested in the SDA church<br>
because of its prophetic interpretations.  Over the last year I have read <br>
several books dealing with the SDA view of how the end times will unfold.<br>
The books I have read are:  The Crisis of the End Times--Marvin Moore, Count<br>
down to Showdown--Dwight Nelson, Day of the Dragon--Clifford Goldstein, and<br>
The Antichrist and the New World Order--Marvin Moore.  Although the authors<br>
do not say so explicitly, I get the impression from these books that they<br>
believe the second coming is very close.  When I say close, it is my impression<br>
that they believe it won't go on much longer than the year 2000.  All of these<br>
books attempt to fit trends which the authors have seen occurring in recent <br>
times into what Adventists believe will happen at the end of time (things like<br>
the rising political influence of the Papacy, the U.S. as the sole remaining<br>
superpower, the increase in strength of the religious right in the U.S., etc).<br>
<p>
    <br>
If I were to look back over the last 30 years at the books published by <br>
Adventists about the end times would I see attempts to fit the trends Adventistshave seen in the past to the Adventist end time scenario?  What I mean is, are<br>
these trends that these authors point to really something significant or are<br>
they just another of many attempts to fit current events into our prophetic<br>
scenario?  Maybe somebody who is aware of what we have published in the <br>
past on current events and the end times can enlighten me.<br>
<p>
I have another question.  I have noticed in talking with Adventist young<br>
adults about the end of times and prophecy that they (at least amoung those<br>
I have talked to) are not really all that interested in the topic.  They have<br>
told me that they have heard this stuff almost their entire life (I am talking<br>
about those young adult SDAs who grew up in the church) and they are tired of<br>
hearing about how imminent the second coming is.  Does anybody know if this<br>
feeling is widespread in the North American church?  Has the SDA church <br>
"gone to the well" one too many times with these people <br>
<p>
<p>
about the imminencey of the second coming?  I ask this question because I<br>
wonder if I have gotten caught up too much in second coming fever (with the<br>
approach of the year 2000)only to be disappointed when it doesn't happen <br>
as soon as I am getting the impression it will from reading these books.<br>
I must say that although I do get the impression that these authors believe<br>
the end of time is very close, no where did they set any times of any sort,<br>
so I may be reading more into what they say than was intened by the authors.<br>

Dear SDANetters,<br>
There were things about the Clinton inauguration that bother me to this day,<br>
and it has nothing to do with politics.  It was something about how the whole<br>
thing unfolded.  I ran across the following quote that perhaps touches on<br>
some of the reasons that we as SDAs were perturbed by the imagery played out<br>
during the "festivities":<br>
<p>
    "During the week of the inaugural festivities, the nation was treated<br>
to a gay, lesbian, and homosexual band trooping down Pennsylvania Avenue.<br>
Then there were the gala parties and balls which the dynamic quadruplet --<br>
Bill, Hillary, Al, and Tipper -- attended.  The performers included Bill's<br>
favorite rock band, FLEETWOOD MAC, with self-proclaimed witch, Stevie<br>
Nicks, on the vocals.  And naturally, there were the Elvis impersonators,<br>
Barbara Streisand, and all the other glitzy Hollywood stars.  Immersed in<br>
ecstasy, the dynamic quadruplet literally drank and danced the night away.<br>
    "Following poet Maya Angelou's pantheistic Mother Earth stanzas, famed<br>
evangelist Billy Graham got up and prayed, asking God's blessings on the<br>
president and the country.<br>
    "As soon as Graham's short prayer of benediction ended, the huge and<br>
enthusiastic crowd went wild.  Gay men and lesbians were seen warmly<br>
embracing their partners, kissing and stroking each other's [deleted].<br>
At the podium, behind a virtually invisible bullet-proof glass shield,<br>
Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton stood, smiled, and waved to the throng.<br>
    "All in all, this was a weird extravaganza: a week of witchery,<br>
sodomizing, New Age quakery, and satanic symphonies.  And culminating it all<br>
was the anointing of the chief culprit responsible, the newly elected<br>
president of the United States, by the world's most admired clergyman...."<br>
[Flashpoint 3/93].<br>

I received in the mail today an unsolicited pamphlet from Dr. Ralph Larson of<br>
the independent ministry known as "Steps to Life."  The pamphlet, entitled<br>
"Issues: The Real Issue, the Side Issues, and the Pseudo Issues," is a<br>
rebuttal to the NAD's recent publication, "Issues: The Seventh-day Adventist<br>
Church and Certain Private Organizations."<br>
<p>
I'm wondering how many of you on SDANet have read this publication and what<br>
your thoughts on it are?<br>
<p>
Specifically, how do you feel about Larson's charge that the following five<br>
"historic Adventist doctrines" are being "replaced" by Calvinistic teachings:<br>
<p>
QUOTING FROM THE PAMPHLET:<br>
<p>
1-- The doctrine that we receive weakness from Adam, but not guilt, now<br>
being replaced by the Calvinistic doctrine of original sin defined as<br>
inherited guilt.<br>
<p>
2-- The doctrine that our Lord came to this earth in the human nature of<br>
fallen man, now being replaced by the Calvinistic doctrine that Christ came<br>
to earth in the human nature of the unfallen Adam.<br>
<p>
3-- The doctrine of righteousness by faith, now being replaced by the<br>
Calvinistic doctrine of unrighteousness by presumption, salvation in sin.<br>
<p>
4-- The doctrine of the sanctuary, now being either denied or replaced by<br>
vague uncertainties.<br>
<p>
5-- Belief in the Spirit of Prophecy, now being denied because it supports<br>
all of the Adventist doctrines listed above and firmly rejects the Calvinistic<br>
doctrines.<br>
<p>
END OF QUOTE.<br>
<p>
My own opinion is such that I question many of Larson's assertions and<br>
methods.  I believe he is demanding that something be either black or white,<br>
when it may really be gray.  I believe he is introducing a spirit of<br>
divisiveness and criticism toward the denomination, instead of working to<br>
make positive change.<br>
<p>
I'd like to hear what some of your opinions are.<br>

[ about how the definition of sin affects one's belief in child baptism ]<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well here's how it works, (for the RCC at least). You are born guilty</i><br>
<i>&gt;of original sin / separate from God / internally at variance with God/ what</i><br>
<i>&gt;ever you like. Now being in this state means that if you die before this</i><br>
<i>&gt;guilt / rebellion / whatever is removed then you die guilty and condemned</i><br>
<i>&gt;to destruction. Accordingly Baptism, which symbolises the removal of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;severed relationship / guilt / you get the idea is a necessary component</i><br>
<i>&gt;for salvation. In this case rather than let a baby die while still guilty</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is better to baptise it and in that way remove the stain due to Adam's</i><br>
<p>
There are two things required here: a belief in original sin AND the <br>
belief that the rite of baptism is essential for salvation.  The<br>
legalistic approach comes more from the second belief than from the<br>
first.<br>
<p>
Further, a belief that sin is a state of separation from God does not<br>
automatically imply original sin.  Just as you don't necessarily impute<br>
your parent's transgression of the law onto the children, you don't have<br>
to impute their "separation from God".  It's just easier.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; As Malcolm stated, where do you draw the line as to what is truth and</i><br>
<i>&gt;what isn't?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well I always thought that God's Word was the test of truth.</i><br>
<p>
If you recall my example, people have difficulty in even agreeing what<br>
God's Word is, let alone how to understand it.  So how useful is this as<br>
a definition?<br>
<p>
The main problem I have with the line of reasoning Ruben is following<br>
is that when taken to its extreme, it reduces arguments to "I read the<br>
Bible and the Holy Spirit revealed &lt;such-and-such&gt; to me.  Someone else<br>
uses the same argument to come to a different conclusion.  I don't<br>
propose that they are both in some sense right, but it seems to me that<br>
there must be something lacking in the process if such a situation is<br>
possible.<br>

To Beng:<br>
<p>
Beng, I guess it depends a lot on a person's definition of an evangelical. <br>
I subscribe to the fact that Adventist's are evangelicals. The reason I <br>
believe we are is due to the fact that evangelicals  are protestants who <br>
emphasize salvation by faith in the atonement of Jesus, and reject the <br>
efficacy of the sacraments and good works alone.<br>

SDA literature has always viewed the second coming as imminent.  During the <br>
first world war, lots of attention was paid to Daniel 11 and the possible<br>
fulfillments of prophecies with the Ottoman Empire as "the king of the north"<br>
The destruction of such empire forced people to re-evaluate.<br>
<p>
In the 1960's rhetoric would have focused on the Catholic president of the<br>
time, plus Vatican II.  The 70's had talk about energy crises forcing<br>
Sunday laws.  In the early 80's the Moral Majority was the favorite target,<br>
and would have been more so were it not for the preponderance of Republicans<br>
among the people who make these interpretations.<br>
<p>
But really, this is how it should be.  We should always feel the imminence<br>
of the 2nd coming and always be ready for it.  The one thing we know for sure<br>
is that every day will be one day closer to the end.<br>

Dear Friends,<br>
Is it possible for somebody to post the Internet or Bitnet addresses of<br>
some Adventist Libraries?  (if there are available of course!)<br>
Especially i would like to have the address from the Andrews University<br>
Library. Do you have an on-line catalog at the Andrews?<br>
I am working on a project to put into computer our catalog at the Theological<br>
Seminary in Warsaw. &lt;SDADS@plearn.edu.pl&gt;<br>
I hope it will be available through Internet next spring!<br>
Have a great Sabbath day!<br>
Jan Pollok<br>
CUA, Washington, DC &lt;94pollok@cua.edu&gt;<br>
PS If you think that my question is not relevant for other member of<br>
our list please send me an information privately.<br>
Thank you in advance!<br>
<p>
<p>
[The account at edmund.cs.andrews.edu is library  (no password).<br>
If you telnet to this machine and login as library, this accesses the <br>
gopher server at Andrews, which includes their online catalog.  <br>
We are working on a set of SDAnet stuff to put in the Andrews gopher.<br>

Hi Steve,<br>
<p>
I received the following letter from a very close friend of mine, from our<br>
church, she is a real good Christian trying to do her best, but now she is<br>
experiencing a terrible dillema.<br>
I'd like to get your input in the following matter, and so from the others<br>
NETER's as well. Please distribute this letter to the Board and to the NET<br>
if u think it could be helpful.<br>
Thanks in advance.<br>
<p>
Yours in Christ.<br>
<p>
Ademir P. Soares<br>

Dear ....<br>
<p>
My problem is as follows:<br>
<p>
I have a nine years old daughter who is beeing influenced by her father ((my<br>
X-husband) who is not SDA). We have been divorced for 6 years. Recently (the<br>
past 6-7 months) he has shown interest in seeing her regularly (one day and<br>
one night a week). He is very materialistic and as such has projected this<br>
type of life style to her. She is very impressed with his way of life (fancy<br>
cars, fancy clothers, jewelry, gambling, his business that is an elegant restau<br>
rant). Now , I have reason for concern he has asked her to live with him. He is<br>
trying all in his power to eliminate all the Christian influence in her life.<br>
She has shown some interest because she will be exposed to this type of life on<br>
a regular basis, and she sees that he wants to take her away from her SDA<br>
family, school, church and friends. However she says that she will not be taken<br>
away from GOD. (I said the same thing when I was 19 and I still went and<br>
married him, later learning the hard way). I have been advised by a good<br>
Christian friend to move out of state with my new SDA husband of three years,<br>
her and our 1 year son. I am not one to run away from my problems but I do NOT<br>
 want to lose my daughter to the world. What should I do?<br>

<i>&gt;If I were to look back over the last 30 years at the books published by </i><br>
<i>&gt;Adventists about the end times would I see attempts to fit the trends Adventistshave seen in the past to the Adventist end time scenario?  What I mean is, are</i><br>
<i>&gt;these trends that these authors point to really something significant or are</i><br>
<i>&gt;they just another of many attempts to fit current events into our prophetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;scenario?  Maybe somebody who is aware of what we have published in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;past on current events and the end times can enlighten me.</i><br>
<p>
Well, some of it is and some of it isn't (fitting current events into<br>
prophecies) but i've noticed that our understanding of prophecy seems to<br>
be reflected in current world trends, and these were prophecies which<br>
we knew about before these trends became prominent. We may not know the<br>
exact details of, say, how the time of trouble and the great worldwide<br>
persecuition of God's people will come about, but current events seem to be<br>
setting the stage for these things to happen. There is the extreme moral<br>
degredation of many societies, which will prime them for moral backlashes,<br>
the great swings in the balence of power amongst the worldly powers, with<br>
America now as the only superpower, and i forgot where the saying came from,<br>
that "power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I have another question.  I have noticed in talking with Adventist young</i><br>
<i>&gt;adults about the end of times and prophecy that they (at least amoung those</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have talked to) are not really all that interested in the topic.  They have</i><br>
<i>&gt;told me that they have heard this stuff almost their entire life (I am talking</i><br>
<i>&gt;about those young adult SDAs who grew up in the church) and they are tired of</i><br>
<i>&gt;hearing about how imminent the second coming is.  Does anybody know if this</i><br>
<i>&gt;feeling is widespread in the North American church?</i><br>
<p>
I don't know about the NAD churches, but i suspect that you can't generalize<br>
amongst them. Amongst the young people in my church, i don't think they're<br>
bored about the 2nd comming, although some are more interested than others.<br>
We've even done plays on the topic even, to try to bring across the urgency<br>
of the times to the rest of the congregation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Has the SDA church "gone to the well" one too many times with these</i><br>
<i>&gt; people about the imminencey of the second coming?  I ask this question</i><br>
<i>&gt; because I wonder if I have gotten caught up too much in second coming</i><br>
<i>&gt; fever (with the approach of the year 2000)only to be disappointed when</i><br>
<i>&gt; it doesn't happen as soon as I am getting the impression it will from</i><br>
<i>&gt; reading these books. I must say that although I do get the impression</i><br>
<i>&gt; that these authors believe the end of time is very close, no where did</i><br>
<i>&gt; they set any times of any sort, so I may be reading more into what they</i><br>
<i>&gt; say than was intened by the authors.</i><br>
<p>
Well, i guess the important thing about it is not just the 2nd comming per<br>
se, but that because Jesus is coming so soon, we need to get our act<br>
together and be as useful to Him as we can, in finishing the work, giving<br>
the last departure/arival call so that as many people as possible will have<br>
as good a chance as possible to know enough to decide which side they want<br>
to be on. The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few, let us work<br>
while it is day, the night cometh when no man can work. In these times,<br>
times that test men's souls, it is our job to help save souls, it is verily<br>
a question of life or death, do or die. We have to let people know: There's<br>
a WAR going on, which side are you on? You'd better make up your mind, 'cause<br>
there ain't much time.<br>
<p>
	As for date-setting, i heard an interesting song on BBC radio once,<br>
on something called the vintage chart show, it was number one in the secular<br>
pop charts of 19 July 1965 and it was "In the Year 2525" by Zager &amp; Evans<br>
, and after several stanzas about the progressive degeneration of the<br>
human race, which happen to be somewhat prophetic, with the benefit of<br>
hindsight, it went like this:<br>
<p>
	In the year 75 ten,<br>
	If God's a commin'<br>
	He oughtta make it by then,<br>
	Maybe He'll look around Himself and say:<br>
	"Guess its time for the judgement day"<br>
<p>
	In the year 8510,<br>
	God is gonna shake His mighty head,<br>
	He'll either say "I'm pleased where man has been"<br>
	Or tear it down, and start again.....<br>
<p>
Well, i don't know who Zager and Evans are, but they got me thinking: If God<br>
doesn't come back pretty soon, the way things are going, He may not have<br>
much left to come back to. But anyway, we know He's coming, so we should<br>
follow the Scout motto: "Be prepared."<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;The original Gospel can be summed up in one word: </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Judaism</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then again, I converted to Adventism because it was the most Jewish of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Christian religions I came across.</i><br>
<p>
Are you a Jew then? In my country there are people of many diverse ethnic<br>
and racial origins, but the Jews are one of the smaller minorities here, and<br>
they tend to keep a low profile, so i don't know much about them, except that<br>
some of them came from India; but i read in Time magazine recently, that in<br>
Israel, there are a few families who migrated there and consider themselves<br>
religious Jews and not Christians, but who believe Yeshua is the messiah and<br>
that He is coming again, also believe the New Testament, whlie observing all<br>
the other Jewish coustoms and festivals (Sabbath, Yom Kippur, kosher laws,<br>
Passover, Hanukkah, etc) but don't observe Easter or Christmas. (come to<br>
that, i'm not sure why Christians obeserve these either)<br>
<p>
	Because of they believe in Yeshua, Israel doesn't want to grant them<br>
citizenship, although they don't mind atheist Jews.<br>
<p>
	It strikes me that if Adventism is the most Jewish of Christian<br>
religions, (I've met 1 or 2 Christians who thought SDAs are Jews because<br>
they keep Sabbath and so on) then perhaps Messianic Jews as they are called,<br>
are the most Christian of the Jewish sects. Well, come to think of it, i<br>
don't suppose it matters to Jesus whether people are called Christians or<br>
Jews or whatever. Anyway, its interesting to find that some Jews know Yeshua<br>
is the messiah. I read in the book "Evangelism" the following:<br>
<p>
                  A LARGE HARVEST FROM THE JEWS<br>
<p>
     Jews Being Numbered With the Israel of God. --  In this our<br>
day, we see the Gentiles beginning to rejoice with the Jews. There<br>
are converted Jews who are now laboring in ----- and in various<br>
other cities, in behalf of their own people. The Jews are coming<br>
into the ranks of God's chosen followers, and are being numbered<br>
with the Israel of God in these closing days. Thus some of the Jews<br>
will once more be reinstated with the people of God, and the<br>
blessing of the Lord will rest upon them richly, if they will come<br>
into the position of rejoicing that is represented in the<br>
Scripture, "And again He saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with His<br>
people."-- Manuscript  95, 1906. <br>
<p>
     Many Will Come to the Light. -- There is a mighty work to be<br>
done in our world. The Lord has declared that the Gentiles shall be<br>
gathered in, and not the Gentiles only, but the Jews. There are<br>
among the Jews many who will be converted, and through whom we<br>
shall see the salvation of God go forth as a lamp that burneth.....<br>
<p>
     The Jews in Many Lands. -- It has been a strange thing to me<br>
that there were so few who felt a burden to labor for the Jewish<br>
people, who are scattered throughout so many lands. Christ will be<br>
with you as you strive to strengthen your perceptive faculties,<br>
that you may more clearly behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away<br>
the sin of the world. The slumbering faculties of the Jewish people<br>
are to be aroused. The Old Testament scriptures, blending with the<br>
New, will be to them as the dawning of a new creation, or as the<br>
resurrection of the soul. Memory will be awakened as Christ is seen<br>
portrayed in the pages of the Old Testament. Souls will be saved,<br>
from the Jewish nation, as the doors of the New Testament are<br>
unlocked with the key of the Old Testament. Christ will be<br>
recognized as the Saviour of the world, as it is seen how clearly<br>
the New Testament explains the Old. Many of the Jewish people will<br>
by faith receive Christ as their Redeemer.-- Letter  47, 1903. <br>
<p>
     Converted Jews in the Closing Work. -- There will be many<br>
converted from among the Jews, and these converts will aid in<br>
preparing the way of the Lord, and making straight in the desert a<br>
highway for our God. Converted Jews are to have an important part<br>
to act in the great preparations to be made in the future to<br>
receive Christ, our Prince. A nation shall be born in a day. How?<br>
By men whom God has appointed being converted to the truth. There<br>
will be seen "first the blade, then the ear, after that the full<br>
corn in the ear." The predictions of prophecy will be fulfilled.--<br>
Manuscript  75, 1905. <br>

Ruben,<br>
Assuming you are in general agreement with Larson's theological views --<br>
some of which I consider to be marginal-- are you also in agreement with<br>
his methods of being openly critical and denunciatory toward the<br>
denomination?  I really object to a person or a small subgroup within the<br>
SDA church claiming that it has become the repositor for "historic<br>
Adventist doctrine" and that it has a special mandate to carry forth the<br>
torch that the denomination fumbled back then (whenever).  I think such<br>
groups are a few steps away from joining the compound in Waco.  Further,<br>
many of their accusations against the denomination, such as misuse of<br>
tithe money, seem rather pompous and presumptous to me.<br>

It's been years since I heard a sermon on America in prophecy. A sermon<br>
on any Western power would be lost on most audiences in Papua New Guinea<br>
too, I might add! (Although things have definitely changed there since I<br>
left in 1979!)<br>
<p>
I was commenting more on the Ayatollah's labelling the USa<br>
(whoops - hit enter instead of shift)<br>
as "The Great Satan" than anything else. America, being the largest<br>
Western democracy, is seen by many as the epitome of capitalism, self-<br>
interest and greed. For instance, during the gulf conflict I heard many<br>
Australians voice the opinion that if it wasn't for the gulf oil, the U.S.A.<br>
would never have been bothered getting involved. Instead, they decided that<br>
they needed to defend the oil, and started making all these speeches about<br>
freedom and human rights.<br>
<p>
Also, you have to understand what an influence American media exports have<br>
on many other societies. Here in Australia a large proportion of our TV<br>
programming and almost all our movies come from America. If a person sees<br>
the degradation of society as being moved along by TV and film...then <br>
America is often where the finger is pointed. American language, dress,<br>
habits and attitudes are starting to spread through many societies, kind<br>
of like a twentieth century Hellenization.<br>
<p>
So the SDA prophetic understanding regarding America is very easy to believe.<br>
Even now, American public figures are far more likely to stand up and claim<br>
"God's will" for themselves than any other public/political individuals in<br>
the world, excepting probably the pope. So any church/state unification or<br>
religiously-motivated legislation is far more likely to happen there than,<br>
say, Australia.<br>
<p>
This probably hasn't been particularly pleasant reading if you are a<br>
patriotic American. Please believe me when I say that what I have written<br>
refers to America the entity, not to Americans as individuals! <br>
<p>
Tony<br>
<p>
ps An example of one particularly unpleasant American public figure is<br>
   Billy Ray Cyrus, who seems to be able to say God, America and Me in every<br>
   second or third sentence!  "Ah just thank Gahd for helping Billyray<br>
   Cahrus reach his dream. That's what America is all about" and so on.<br>

----&gt;<br>
1-- The doctrine that we receive weakness from Adam, but not guilt, now<br>
being replaced by the Calvinistic doctrine of original sin defined as<br>
inherited guilt.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I think what is taught by many now is along the lines of "Sin is living<br>
your life independently of God in wilful rebellion against his authority."<br>
And the when a human is born, the default is that they are not in a proper<br>
relationship with God, and that this must be remedied. Contrast with the<br>
original situation, where humans would have been born in a proper relationship<br>
with God.So it's not so much "guilt" that is inherited from Adam, just the<br>
fact that humanity as a whole was separated from God. The visible signs of<br>
this come in the form of wilful rebellion, ie sinful acts and so on.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
2-- The doctrine that our Lord came to this earth in the human nature of<br>
fallen man, now being replaced by the Calvinistic doctrine that Christ came<br>
to earth in the human nature of the unfallen Adam.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I think what is taught by many now is that Christ inherited weakness from<br>
Adam, referred to in point 1, but that he was born without the separation<br>
from God that the rest of us inherit. The "human nature" of Christ <br>
is seen as the human mind and body, deteriorated from its original state<br>
due to thousands of years of living in rebellion. The "divine nature" is<br>
seen as the total relationship between Christ and his heavenly father, among<br>
other things.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
3-- The doctrine of righteousness by faith, now being replaced by the<br>
Calvinistic doctrine of unrighteousness by presumption, salvation in sin.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I have never heard anything like this myself in any church, although I<br>
believe some of the pentecostal/charismatic congregations teach this kind<br>
of thing. I think this is a misunderstanding on both sides. <br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
4-- The doctrine of the sanctuary, now being either denied or replaced by<br>
vague uncertainties.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I have heard SDAs say that Hebrews does not speak about the geography of<br>
heaven, although they do believe there is a heavenly sanctuary, and that<br>
the priestly role of Christ changed in 1844. Does this constitute a vague<br>
uncertainty? (not a rhetorical question btw)<br>
<p>
I personally know some SDAs who may not believe in the doctrine of the<br>
sanctuary and maybe not the investigative judgment, but I have never heard<br>
this mentioned inside an SDA church. Then again, perhaps the fact that I<br>
rarely hear the doctrine of the sanctuary is evidence for point 4. I don't<br>
really know. <br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
5-- Belief in the Spirit of Prophecy, now being denied because it supports<br>
all of the Adventist doctrines listed above and firmly rejects the Calvinistic<br>
doctrines.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I honestly don't know where many SDAs stand regarding their acceptance of<br>
E.G.White and her writings. I don't know any SDAs who don't believe in the<br>
Spirit of Prophecy, but it is certainly possible that some question whether<br>
EGW herself had this gift. I myself refuse to *equate* "Spirit of Prophecy"<br>
with "the testimonies of Ellen White" to the exclusion of other manifestations<br>
of the gift.<br>
<p>
One thing which is certainly needed is some open discussion about the role<br>
of EG White, both in the nineteenth century and today. There are certainly<br>
some problems with the way some have represented her writings and her role,<br>
and these problems exist on both sides of the issue. Anybody who brings up<br>
difficulties with the red books tends to be classed as a "critic", whereas<br>
to me it is important to face these difficulties and deal with them.<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
I'd like to hear what some of your opinions are.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Well, there you are!<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; means nothing to a tribesman who doesn't do so anyway?  Is the SDA church </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; American no matter what country we are in?  SCT]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Well, i don't know about other countries, but here in Southeast Asia, there<br>
is a lot of American influence in the church, especially in Singapore, where<br>
the Far Eastern Division HQ and the Southeast Asia Union HQ are based (there<br>
are a lot of Americans working in the administration in these places) and we<br>
often get GC people passing through and they more or less always give a<br>
sermon in my church; and there are choirs and evangelists which sometimes<br>
pass through these parts too. My church pastor is presently an American from<br>
Texas and there are many American expatriates in the congregation too.<br>
Besides that, some of our publications: quarterlies, Adventist Review NAD<br>
edition, books etc. come from the USA, (but we now get Signs of the Times<br>
from Australia too, and that edition is somewhat different from the US<br>
version). The Southeast Asia Union College here in Singapore, where our<br>
local pastors are trained, follows the American system of education and is<br>
affliated to Walla Walla College, and many Southeast-Asians who graduate<br>
from it go on to study in the States and return more Americanised. So yes,<br>
the flavour is somewhat American.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I would also like to hear about the teaching of USA in prophecy in other </i><br>
<i>&gt;countries.  Please people outside of the USA give the sermons and theology</i><br>
<i>&gt;taught in your country.</i><br>
<p>
Well, as far back as i can remember, our teachings about the USA in prophecy<br>
have been similar to those found in "The Great Controversy" by E. G. White<br>
and "Daniel and the Revelation" by Uriah Smith. That is that the Lamb-Like<br>
Beast of Revelation 13 represents America, and in the light of events in the<br>
past couple of years, it appears that this prophecy is coming true even now.<br>

<p>
I may be reading something into Tony's tone that is not there, in fact,<br>
but I get the feeling that he may have meant Americans often act very<br>
"beastly" (and in my mind's ear, I'm recalling the connotation I get from<br>
hearing Brits use this word).  8-)  And since I'm Canadian 8-) ...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [This is interesting.  Is Tony suggesting that "USA in prophecy" type sermons</i><br>

<p>
FYI, in Arizona we only seem to get these sermons around July 4 and on<br>
Religious Liberty emphasis Sabbath.  Would not seem a "common" occurence.<br>
<p>

<p>
Undoubtedly Americanisms and American perspectives can creep into one's<br>
belief system.  However, given that we SDAs interpret the lamb-like beast of<br>
Revelation as representing the United States, and rightly so I would argue<br>
(cf. Great Controversy), it is definitely *not* inappropriate to preach that<br>
interpretation 'round the world.  It is the implications and consequences<br>
of this that will be "customized" by geographic circumstance, IMHO. <br>
<p>
I'm curious (not skeptical) re what (presumably unwarranted) Americanisms<br>
you all see present in SDA beliefs (as distinct from what a given individual<br>
might personally subscribe to).<br>

Hi, Ruben asked what other kinds of inspiration there could be besides<br>
verbal inspiration and thought inspiration. In his series of papers which<br>
appeared in the Journal of Adventist Education, V44, No. 1, 2 &amp; 3, Roger<br>
Coon listed three different theories. In my view, two of them were very<br>
much oversimplified, but then again Coon's aim was to affirm the<br>
truth of the plenary (thought) inspiration, not to objectively discuss all<br>
three. Here I have quoted one or two short paragraphs from each of his<br>
three descriptions.<br>
<p>
1. Theory of verbal inspiration<br>
<p>
...This view is rather a mechanical one, since it perceives the prophet's <br>
role as simply that of a stenographer who takes down the boss's dictation<br>
word for word. In this model the stenographer is not at liberty to change<br>
anything that has been given by the dictator: no synonyms may ever be<br>
employed; no failing to dot an "i" or to cross a "t" is permitted.<br>
<p>
This view seems to suggest that God, or the angel, puts a heavenly hand over<br>
the hand of the prophet and guides it - literally - so that every word,<br>
every syllable comes directly from God. The prophet, in this view, is not at<br>
liberty to change anything or to state the message in his own words. This<br>
mechanical view is strictly, stringently literalistic, with infallibility<br>
residing at the point of the written word.<br>
<p>
2. Theory of Plenary Inspiration<br>
<p>
In contrast with the view of verbal inspiration, the plenary theory of<br>
inspiration suggests that thoughts - rather than words - are inspired. The<br>
plenary view is not forced to grapple with the problems of the verbalist.<br>
For the SDA, this view has the added advantage of having been accepted and<br>
advocated by Ellen White.<br>
<p>
3. Theory of Encounter Inspiration<br>
<p>
(ref. Robertson and Dederin, in "The Challenge to God's Word", although it<br>
sounds like this is itself a discussion of the original material on<br>
Encounter Inspiration)<br>
<p>
As encounter theology sees it, revelation (or inspiration) is an experience<br>
that takes place in an "I-Thou" encounter between the prophet and God. It<br>
is then, primarily, and experience, with no exchange of information taking<br>
place.<br>
<p>
This view is based, at least in part, on the "I-Thou" concept of Philosopher<br>
(sic) Martin Buber. The three basic tenets or postulates will now be<br>
examined:<br>
<p>
	1. Inspiration is, by its very nature, inherently subjective rather<br>
	   than objective.<br>
<p>
	2. The Bible contains the word of God, but is not itself the word<br>
	   of God.<br>
<p>
	3. Inspiration is "quantitative, not qualitative".<br>
<p>
<p>
Coon's papers are quite interesting and informative, although as I said<br>
earlier, they're not very objective. I am now looking for more material on<br>
"Encounter Inspiration", because I would like to know more about what it is.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; &gt;Well I always thought that God's Word was the test of truth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you recall my example, people have difficulty in even agreeing what</i><br>
<i>&gt; God's Word is, let alone how to understand it.  So how useful is this as</i><br>
<i>&gt; a definition?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The main problem I have with the line of reasoning Ruben is following</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that when taken to its extreme, it reduces arguments to "I read the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bible and the Holy Spirit revealed &lt;such-and-such&gt; to me.  Someone else</i><br>
<i>&gt; uses the same argument to come to a different conclusion.  I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; propose that they are both in some sense right, but it seems to me that</i><br>
<i>&gt; there must be something lacking in the process if such a situation is</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Well If we can't trust the bible and the H.S then who do you propose we follow<br>
the majority or the traditions of our church leaders, or what ?<br>
<p>
Ruben. <br>

I'm going to re-arrange the order of the text slightly ...<br>
<p>
[davidbu@loowit.wr.tek.com writes:]<br>
<i>&gt; [re lay sermons re Aaron &amp; Hur, from Ex 17]</i><br>
<p>
The idea for this appears to have been sparked by a fairly recent<br>
article in the Adventist Review (fyi, for those not receiving it).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Moses -- the prophet with his arms reaching out to God.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Aaron -- the ordained ministry (priesthood).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Hur   -- the laymen of the church (one of the artisans).</i><br>
<p>
Since what we have in Ex 17 is neither parable nor prophecy but history,<br>
we may have some more leeway re what this story teaches us (1 Cor 10:11).<br>
I agree 100% that a direct application is that ministers and laymen should<br>
be fully supportive of God's prophet(ess).  (For instruction on what to<br>
do if this is not the case, we need to look elsewhere.)  However, I think<br>
it not untoward (cf 2 Pet 3:16) to also apply it to members' relation<br>
to pastors and others with leadership responsibility.  {Could someone<br>
check EGW refs (anyone got the CD-ROM?) to Aaron &amp; Hur to see if this<br>
latter application has precedent?  I'm thinking maybe ...}<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Club membership equates to supporting your local pastor (and conference).</i><br>
<p>
If we accept the second application as permissible, the next question is:<br>
How are we lay folk to support our pastors?  (I have some material at<br>
home re this that I can maybe post later.)  For starters, we have Gal 6:2,<br>
James 5:16, Ps 105:15; cf I Tim 2:1,2.  However, support should not be<br>
construed to mean unquestioned, unverified, untested acceptance (1 John 4:1;<br>
Acts 17:11) of every word.  Gal 6:1 specifically addresses instances wherein<br>
any member, pastor or layperson, is off-base (tho note its warning, similar<br>
to 1 Cor 10:12).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A big reason for starting up these clubs is to try and get people</i><br>
<i>&gt; to quit complaining about the pastors no longer supporting EGW, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; serious Bible truths.  The idea is that the pastor should be free</i><br>
<i>&gt; to preach anything he wants without getting hassled.</i><br>
<p>
I think it exceedingly needful and timely for us to understand Scriptural<br>
methods of how to express concern or make an appeal.  Lack of true<br>
humility (Jam 4:6), a conscience not void of offense (Acts 24:16),<br>
using man's tactics (Is 55:8,9; Zec 4:6), inappropriate timing (Pro 27:14),<br>
impatience (Rom 15:5; 2 Cor 6:4; Col 1:11; 1 Ti 6:11; 2 Ti 2:2; Jam 5:10),<br>
etc, can all be impediments [*].  And if, despite following Scriptural<br>
methods, we are rejected in our appeal, we can find comfort in 1 Pet 2:19-24,<br>
3:14-17.  God is *still* in control (Ps 75:7; Dan 3:17, 4:35,37; John 19:11).<br>
{Btw, it was instructive to me just finding (!) these verses.}<br>
<p>
[*] I recall walking thru the church foyer some years back and passing by<br>
    the visiting speaker, a prior conference president, who had been<br>
    button-holed by another visitor.  The latter's face was livid, his<br>
    tone of voice sharp, punctuated by thumping a fist into the other hand.<br>
    I caught "...and if you don't, their blood will be upon your hands!"<br>
    However valid his point, it's questionable if it got across.<br>

I just wanted to thank you for the work you have been doing with SDA-L and NET.<br>
It's also occurred to me that I never did send any type of introduction to you,<br>
so here goes:<br>
<p>
      Lin Collette works as a secretary at Brown University and is a doctoral<br>
      student in Race and Religious Studies at the Union Institute, Cincinnati<br>
      Ohio.  She is not an SDA, but is interested in Adventism anyway!  She is<br>
      (at present) a Catholic.<br>
<p>
I'm sure you'll want to cut this, so feel free.  I just wanted to give you some<br>
facts in case you needed them.  Thanks again.   lin<br>

After scanning the 160 odd pieces of email, most of it SDAnet,<br>
which I received in the last week and a half, I feel a bit of a speech<br>
coming on.<br>
<p>
Are we Evangelical, Protestant etc?<br>
<p>
This question no doubt has to do with our sense of identity. We like to<br>
think of ourselves being different, and that those differences are important.<br>
I would be the last to suggest that the differences are not important, but<br>
I am also concerned that sometimes we make wear those differences high on<br>
our sleeves when it would be best not to do so. Surely there is a lot<br>
of common ground between Catholics, Protestants, Evangelicals, Charasmatics<br>
and Seventh-day Adventists. I recall a discussion on Christianity I had with<br>
a Catholic Priest, whose kindness and love reflect a love of Jesus that we<br>
would all do well to emulate. In dealing with Christians of other faiths<br>
establishing a common ground in love leads to some informed discussion on<br>
the differences?<br>
<p>
I was once asked by an evangelical about the differences in the SDA church.<br>
(He had heard about the issues raised by Des Ford) I briefly summarised the<br>
problems and He shook his head and said "what a stupid thing to argue over."<br>
I asked him what the current situation was in the Uniting Church of Australia,<br>
and he laughed and said "They are much the same as in the Adventist Church."<br>
The discussion we had on Christain values in the face of internal conflicts<br>
in the church was a conversation I still value highly. Our differences<br>
were minimised, our experiences were shared and I felt better for it because<br>
some of my fears about the church were put aside.<br>
<p>
United States in Prophecy<br>
<p>
In Australia there is quite a broad spectrum of thought on USA in prophecy.<br>
Those who follow a traditional line would see very definite references and<br>
would like to hear more on that line of interpretation. In a Sabbath<br>
School class last year at Avondale College I ventured to suggest that we<br>
ought to adopt a more open approach to the question and I was immediatly<br>
taken to task by 2 theology students waving their Bibles in the air and<br>
declaring that I was abandoning the faith.<br>
<p>
I have no quarrel with the interpretation that USA fulfills a place in <br>
prophecy, but I hesitate to tie some prophecies to concrete organisations.<br>
I rather think sometimes that things like the media today are playing<br>
the role of the image of the beast, subtly changing our moral attitudes<br>
and bending our perception of good and evil. There is always the danger<br>
that we watch the wrong horse, while an outsider sneaks up on us unawares.<br>
<p>
In answer to the specific question "What do SDA's preach about USA in<br>
prophecy in other countries?" In Australia, I don't here many sermons about<br>
it. In fact I do not hear many sermons about prophecy and last day events<br>
full stop (period, for our American friends). That probably is a pity, but<br>
I think the sermons we are getting are relevent and challenging non-the-less. <br>

 Someone, I forget his name, posted about the possibility of putting our faith<br>
 in a date and ending up in bad shape if the date passes.  This reminded me of<br>
 the "prophecy" of the world ending in 2000 AD or close to it.  I have heard<br>
 a few arguments and I will summarize them.<br>
 <br>
 1. Every 2000 years something big happens.  Creation - Flood - Christ - 2nd<br>
    advent.  I have never heard a real precise definition of Big, but there<br>
    is no doubt these are big things.  One thing that is in doubt is 2000<br>
       years happening between each of these events.  I guess 2000 years<br>
       give or take a few hundred years.  But to give or take a few hundred<br>
       years you add a few hundred years past the supposed date 0of the <br>
       adfvent.<br>
 <br>
 2. A day equals a thousand years with God.  Creation is 7 days, therefore<br>
    the world will last 6000 years plus a seventh day of rest.  Perhaps someone<br>
    who teaches this could better explain this one.<br>
 <br>
 3. Ellen White said that the world would last 6000 years.  She said sin would<br>
    reign for 6000 years.  I also saw whre she said the world was 6000 years old <br>
    at her time.  I saw her say that the flood was 4000 years ago in her day.<br>
    Does this mean that these dates are exactly true?  My faith in ellen White<br>
    soes not stand or fall on a legalistic reading of a few numbers.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Then before the argument closes, whichever of the three they use, they say<br>
 Jesus said no one knows the day or the hour.  He did not say anything about<br>
 the year.<br>
 <br>
 I must say I have heard these arguments many a time, I have even heard the<br>
 year 1996 spoken specifically from the pulpit.<br>
 <br>
 Before I close, I want to make it clear that I am an Adventist meaning I<br>
 do look for the coming of Christ.  I hope and pray we will be ready for him<br>
 if the years is 1993 (The last movements will be rapid ones), 1996, or 2040.<br>
 <br>
 If the year 2000 passes and Christ has not come, I will continue to sing,<br>
 "I don't believe He brought me this far to leave me."<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My own opinion is such that I question many of Larson's assertions and</i><br>
<i>&gt; methods.  I believe he is demanding that something be either black or white,</i><br>
<i>&gt; when it may really be gray.  I believe he is introducing a spirit of</i><br>
<i>&gt; divisiveness and criticism toward the denomination, instead of working to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make positive change.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
He may be promoting a spirit of devisiveness.  Was he one of the individuals<br>
that was named in the churches document on Independent ministers?<br>
<p>
I must say, however that these are important points.  At least theological <br>
points.  They should and must be dealt with.  Let us put aside Mr. Larson's<br>
"assertions and methods" and look at these issues.  The issues of the <br>
Human Nature of Christ, overcoming of sin.  If we can do this, we can brign<br>
good out of an attack.<br>
<p>
Let us continue on the SDAnet to discuss these things and others so we can <br>
make a positive change.  I love the stimulation and continued study that this<br>
mailing list gives.l<br>

<p>
Something perhaps worthy of discussion is:  What distinguishes "helpful<br>
and constructive" comment from "damaging" comment?  When one is on<br>
the receiving end, it is often difficult to be objective.  Also, what<br>
distinguishes "criticism" from 'expressing concern' or 'making a<br>
heart-felt appeal'?  Since I think we are all willing to accept that<br>
conference and institution leaders can and do make mistakes, how should<br>
a concerned brother or sister relate? i.e., what characterizes a godly,<br>
Scripturally-based approach?<br>

<i>&gt; I received in the mail today an unsolicited pamphlet from Dr. Ralph Larson of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the independent ministry known as "Steps to Life." </i><br>
<p>
Steps to Life printed it; however, I believe Ralph Larson is not on the staff.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm wondering how many of you on SDANet have read this publication and what</i><br>
<i>&gt; your thoughts on it are?</i><br>
<p>
I've read it.  The response from Hartland by Colin Standish comes across<br>
"kinder and gentler" but expresses similar concern over historic beliefs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Specifically, how do you feel about Larson's charge that the following five</i><br>
<i>&gt; "historic Adventist doctrines" are being "replaced" by Calvinistic teachings:</i><br>
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
Whether his claims ("charge" feels over strong to me) are valid or not<br>
would come from examining the large body of extant material.  He claims to<br>
have collated the relevant and supporting material into a couple of his books.<br>
A reading of these or the original documents might prove enlightening.<br>
My wife and I are studying Scripture and SoP again with an eye to some of<br>
these points.  As to whether Larson should speak up wherein he sees a<br>
concern .. we have found Eze 33 and Testimonies to Ministers &amp; Gospel Workers<br>
to be remarkably relevant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4-- The doctrine of the sanctuary, now being either denied or replaced by</i><br>
<i>&gt; vague uncertainties.</i><br>
<p>
I can assert that a previous pastor at our Tempe church denied the existence<br>
of a heavenly sanctuary and claimed believing in such was unnecessary.<br>
When gently questioned (during a mid-week meeting), he referred to his<br>
Seminary classes.  Since I find the body of Scriptural and SoP evidence<br>
strongly supportive of a heavenly sanctuary (e.g., 2 Cor 5, Heb 9), his<br>
statements certainly gave me pause re what he was taught.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I believe he is demanding that something be either black or white,</i><br>
<i>&gt; when it may really be gray.</i><br>
<p>
This is the claim of "Issues" (granted I've only read the Nov insert and<br>
the Dec article in the Review).  However, are these areas really gray?<br>
Scripture is generally pretty clear, when studied in depth and as a whole<br>
(e.g., I Thess 4:13).  As above mentioned above, a thorough study of<br>
Scripture and SoP, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, should clarify,<br>
esp since sanctuary issues are pillars/landmarks.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I believe he is introducing a spirit of</i><br>
<i>&gt; divisiveness and criticism toward the denomination, instead of working to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make positive change.</i><br>
<p>
Rom 16:17 ties divisiveness to false doctrine, not truth (cf. I Cor 1:10).<br>
If his claims are demonstrably false per the authority and testimony of<br>
Scripture and SoP (and it is unquestionably justified to include EGW<br>
testimonies since historicity is in question), then he would be<br>
considered divisive.  But if his claims are true, by the same criteria,<br>
then he is seeking the unity of the Spirit and of the faith (Eph 4:3,13),<br>
which Christ prayed of the Father.<br>

Ruben sent in a post which originally appeared on soc.religion.christian<br>
(the major Usenet newsgroup).  It's 35K long so I won't send it out<br>
unless people want to see it.  It's some non-SDA "prophet" who claims<br>
to have admonishing for the church at large on how to relate to the <br>
election of Bill Clinton.  It's mostly good advice.<br>

[From Gary Burdick.  Just a note, Steps To Life was founded by the late <br>
Marshall Grosboll and is currently run by his brother John Grosboll.  <br>
If I mistake not both are former SDA pastors; a recent ordination at <br>
this organization caused no small stir.  Larson participated in that service,<br>
and they publish his works, but to my knowledge he himself has not been<br>
dropped from membership in the SDA church nor has he had his credentials<br>
revoked.   SCT]<br>

<i>&gt; I received in the mail today an unsolicited pamphlet from Dr. Ralph Larson of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the independent ministry known as "Steps to Life."  The pamphlet, entitled</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Issues: The Real Issue, the Side Issues, and the Pseudo Issues," is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; rebuttal to the NAD's recent publication, "Issues: The Seventh-day Adventist</i><br>
<i>&gt; Church and Certain Private Organizations."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm wondering how many of you on SDANet have read this publication and what</i><br>
<i>&gt; your thoughts on it are?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Specifically, how do you feel about Larson's charge that the following five</i><br>
<i>&gt; "historic Adventist doctrines" are being "replaced" by Calvinistic teachings:</i><br>
<p>
I find the section on the five historic doctrines to be the only<br>
logical and arguably defensible part of the entire pamphlet.  I could<br>
not find a single instance where the book "Issues" actually says what<br>
Larson claims it said.  In my opinion, Larson is a real artist when it<br>
comes to taking quotes out of context and making others say what he<br>
wants them to say.  However, as the question raised above deals<br>
specifically with the five "Calvinistic teachings" I will refrain from<br>
expounding further on Larson's scholarship :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; QUOTING FROM THE PAMPHLET:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1-- The doctrine that we receive weakness from Adam, but not guilt, now</i><br>
<i>&gt; being replaced by the Calvinistic doctrine of original sin defined as</i><br>
<i>&gt; inherited guilt.</i><br>
<p>
It is true that many Adventists now emphasize the fact that we are<br>
born in a state of separation from God, and thus unable, on our own,<br>
to choose to do right.  And it is only through faith in God that this<br>
relationship can be restored:  "Everything not of faith is sin."<br>
However, I do not know of a single Adventist that believes in original<br>
sin or inherited guilt.  We are born with Adam's separation from God,<br>
but not with Adam's guilt.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2-- The doctrine that our Lord came to this earth in the human nature of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fallen man, now being replaced by the Calvinistic doctrine that Christ came</i><br>
<i>&gt; to earth in the human nature of the unfallen Adam.</i><br>
<p>
Once again, the emphasis has shifted in order to emphasize that Christ<br>
was born with an unbroken relationship to God, a relationship that we<br>
also may have through faith in Christ.  But this does not negate the<br>
fact that He was "tempted in all points like we are," that He came in<br>
the flesh with the possiblity of failure, or that we may overcome<br>
(through faith in Him) like Christ overcame.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3-- The doctrine of righteousness by faith, now being replaced by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Calvinistic doctrine of unrighteousness by presumption, salvation in sin.</i><br>
<p>
Our GC president emphasizes very strongly the "assurance of<br>
salvation."  But to consider this "salvation in sin" (and thus<br>
presumption) rather than "salvation from sin" is to totally<br>
misunderstand his message.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 4-- The doctrine of the sanctuary, now being either denied or replaced by</i><br>
<i>&gt; vague uncertainties.</i><br>
<p>
It is my understanding that at one time, most non-Adventists<br>
misunderstood our position on the sanctuary to mean that Christ was<br>
continually being sacrificed for us.  At the time of the writing of<br>
_Questions_on_Doctrine_, we changed the wording of our belief in order<br>
to clarify our true stand, that Christ was sacrificed once and for all<br>
on the cross, and Christ is presently applying that sacrifice to us.<br>
This rewording has been attacked as an evangelical compromise.<br>
However, I believe that our fundamental belief has not changed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 5-- Belief in the Spirit of Prophecy, now being denied because it supports</i><br>
<i>&gt; all of the Adventist doctrines listed above and firmly rejects the</i><br>
Calvinistic<br>
<i>&gt; doctrines.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Many of us know what it feels like to be hit over the head with Mrs.<br>
White's writings--and are thus unwilling to treat others as harshly<br>
and unlovingly as we ourselves have been treated--but that does not<br>
mean that we have thrown out Ellen White.  Also, the fact that I<br>
reject Ralph Larson's interpretation of what Mrs. White says does not<br>
mean I reject what Mrs. White says. (There is a difference :-) )<br>
Personally, I believe that _Steps_to_Christ_ is the single best<br>
exposition on the gospel that has ever been written.<br>
<p>
But, all of this is just my opinion.  I do know people who believe<br>
that every word Ralph Larson has ever written is the gospel truth.<br>
And I cannot help but feel sorry for them.  It must be a miserable<br>
feeling to sincerely believe that everyone else in the church is in<br>
apostacy.  <br>

The talk of a "personal relationship with Christ", "accepting Him as <br>
your personal savior", and other such clauses are fairly recent, as far<br>
as I can tell.  Certainly no such clauses appear in the Bible, and that<br>
worries <br>
me somewhat.<br>
<p>
The definition of sin and the process of salvation are quite connected.  <br>
I remember when I was in fifth and sixth grade I was quite worried about<br>
this, thinking that the verses "To him that knoweth to do good and doeth<br>
it not, to him it is sin,", "Sin is the transgression of the law", and<br>
"all <br>
have sinned and come short of the glory of God"  were all in contradiction<br>
with each other.  I was taught a very legalistic view of religion in<br>
general, and I would sometimes have nightmares about being outside of<br>
heaven, particularly because I wasn't baptized at the time.  Yet I<br>
resisted the <br>
"baptismal mill" that the rest of the fifth graders at my church school<br>
were put through.<br>
<p>
Later, in seventh grade, my Bible teacher explained the idea in a 3-tiered<br>
relationship plan.  The first tier was knowing God and having a<br>
relationship, which would lead to right thoughts and attitudes, and thus<br>
to right actions.<br>
The opposite would be a broken relationship with God, which would lead to <br>
wrong thoughts and attitudes and thus to wrong actions.  All three of<br>
these levels would be sin, but it was all curable through a restoration<br>
of the relationship with God.<br>
<p>
So I don't want to tear down this idea, it was and continues to be one<br>
of the central organizing principles of my life.  It would, however, be<br>
nice to find<br>
more scriptural support for it than I'm aware exists now.  It provides a<br>
valuable counterpoint to the narrow definition of sin that claims it is<br>
only actions as opposed to sinful thoughts or broken relationship with<br>
God.<br>
At the end, the gospel is not whether I know Christ, but whether He knows me.<br>

My comments on the pamphlet<br>
<i>&gt;1-- The doctrine that we receive weakness from Adam, but not guilt, now</i><br>
<i>&gt;being replaced by the Calvinistic doctrine of original sin defined as</i><br>
<i>&gt;inherited guilt.</i><br>
<p>
Although I agree that a hatchet job on this doctrine was done in Questions<br>
On Doctrine, (also #2), it doesn't seem to have penetrated to other areas<br>
such as the Fundamental Beliefs.  Inherited guilt is a moot point in <br>
any case because by now all humans have sinned whether we start out that<br>
way or not.  Rom. 3:23<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2-- The doctrine that our Lord came to this earth in the human nature of</i><br>
<i>&gt;fallen man, now being replaced by the Calvinistic doctrine that Christ came</i><br>
<i>&gt;to earth in the human nature of the unfallen Adam.</i><br>
<p>
Larson seems unwilling to admit that Christ was in any way advantaged<br>
over His fellow humans.  This makes it hard for him to show why it was <br>
necessary for Christ to be divine, or why a savior ought to be divine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3-- The doctrine of righteousness by faith, now being replaced by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Calvinistic doctrine of unrighteousness by presumption, salvation in sin.</i><br>
<p>
You can scarcely call the current mix Calvinistic, because Calvinists<br>
are predestinarians, which no SDA's of any flavor are.  Nevertheless<br>
there is antinomianism in the SDA church and Larson is right to call it<br>
to task.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;4-- The doctrine of the sanctuary, now being either denied or replaced by</i><br>
<i>&gt;vague uncertainties.</i><br>
<p>
Besides those on the far left in SDA colonies, and Desmond Ford's crowd,<br>
I have not seen a wholesale rejection of the sanctuary doctrine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;5-- Belief in the Spirit of Prophecy, now being denied because it supports</i><br>
<i>&gt;all of the Adventist doctrines listed above and firmly rejects the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Calvinistic doctrines.</i><br>
<p>
The position being denied is that of various Review editors after the<br>
death of Ellen G. White who built up the doctrine of verbal inspiration<br>
in contradiction to her writings.  Perhaps this re-examination would not<br>
have <br>
taken place had not the Walter Rea controversy occured.  But I think <br>
the re-examination is good for the church.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;END OF QUOTE.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;My own opinion is such that I question many of Larson's assertions and</i><br>
<i>&gt;methods.  I believe he is demanding that something be either black or white,</i><br>
<i>&gt;when it may really be gray.  I believe he is introducing a spirit of</i><br>
<i>&gt;divisiveness and criticism toward the denomination, instead of working to</i><br>
<i>&gt;make positive change.</i><br>
<p>
If a gray position is a compromise between the black and white position<br>
(both of which are often wrong), then I want no part of it.  A compromise<br>
between two wrong opinions is still wrong.  If we can give up the dependence<br>
on binary logic and see that sometimes both opinions can be right and other<br>
times both can be wrong, we'd get a lot farther faster.  Larson is not<br>
introducing a spirit of criticism and dissension into the denomination--<br>
it's been with us from the beginning.  His discourses are in the best<br>
of time-honored SDA tradition.  That's the only way he knows how to<br>
communicate, and we ought not to fault him for that.<br>

I don't know the legal details of Ademir's friend, so would first advise<br>
her not to break any details of the divorce settlement or custody rulings.<br>
It seems that the key thing which will need to be put into the life of <br>
this nine-year old girl is a positive involvement with religious things.<br>
Most Primary Sabbath Schools, alas, are not well-equipped in this regard.<br>
If they move to Elmhurst, IL, the girl can be in our puppet troupe.<br>
But perhaps there is some other challenge.  My folks promised me a stereo<br>
system at about that age if I learned a substancial list of memory verses.<br>
<p>
The other alternative is just to experiment with letting the girl have<br>
some of what she wants and discover the emptiness of things.  It's not <br>
clear that at nine years old she would be mature enough to learn that lesson.<br>

Tony Writes:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think what is taught by many now is along the lines of "Sin is living</i><br>
<i>&gt; your life independently of God in wilful rebellion against his authority."</i><br>
<i>&gt; And the when a human is born, the default is that they are not in a proper</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship with God, and that this must be remedied. Contrast with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original situation, where humans would have been born in a proper relationship</i><br>
<i>&gt; with God.So it's not so much "guilt" that is inherited from Adam, just the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact that humanity as a whole was separated from God. The visible signs of</i><br>
<i>&gt; this come in the form of wilful rebellion, ie sinful acts and so on.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If the so called "new-theologians" are not teaching that guilt is passed<br>
to the children just a separate condition, I have had a mistaken understanding<br>
of their teaching.  Perhaps I have seen a distorted picture of their teachings<br>

As I have just waded through this weeks 240k of SDAnet "Digest", may I <br>
reemphasize a plea from others:  Please, PLEASE reduce the volume of qouted <br>
and requoted text!<br>
<p>
I have three responses so far...<br>
<p>
RE: Tony's question "Christians are ... called to preach the gospel. [Any] <br>
mandate for preaching three angels message...?<br>
<p>
Well, when I read Rev. 14.6, I find an angel with the "eternal Gospel to <br>
proclaim..." and what I really have to evaluate is, How is the gospel of <br>
Revelation 14 the same gospel of Galatians 1, Romans 1, etc, etc...<br>
<p>
Paul says his gospel was received "by revelation from Jesus Christ" (Gal <br>
1:12), and that what "is no gospel at all" is one confused and perverted, <br>
in the larger context, by those (Judaizers) who wished to bind the church <br>
with Old Testament ceremony.<br>
Paul's gospel (Rom 1:16)  is "the power of God for salvation ... a <br>
righteousness from God ... a righteousness by faith from first to last".<br>
<p>
Now, if a message to put God first and only; that a mixed, adulterated <br>
religion [one that says Christ AND --- (insert ANYTHING here)] is fallen; <br>
and that judgment is a call to remain faithful to Jesus is NOT the gospel, <br>
what, pray tell, is?<br>
<p>
****************<br>
RE: SDA E-Mail directory<br>
<p>
The GC has mapped the first six digits of all SDA institutions, including <br>
local churches, to an ATT Email address. The "master list" has recently <br>
appeared in documentation regarding the processing of SDA service <br>
(employment) records. Southeastern California Conference's (where I work) <br>
is "ANPM11", but since you don't find this code in Harvey's list, you would <br>
correctly assume that SECC is *not* a subscriber to ATT Email.<br>
 <br>
Which brings me to a third subject,<br>
************<br>
RE: Ned Torres, distrust ... toward computer tech ... among SDA's<br>
<p>
Here at SECC, the problem isn't as much a *fear* of technology as it is (1) <br>
a serious lack of funds to do *big* things, (2) haziness among <br>
administrators as to the value of WAN technology, and (3) a lack of <br>
communication - human networking - among the diaspora of computer literates <br>
and professionals among the official church.<br>
<p>
An evolutionary, perhaps conspiratory, sometimes underground, and <br>
definitely cheap, strategy is the rule here.<br>
<p>
We started small - a PC-XT compatible a few years back - and have migrated <br>
most to the 386/486 level. The XT's went to directors and then schools, <br>
etc.  Today, many of our directors &amp; administrators carry notebooks, laser <br>
printers are everywhere, and everyone but the gardener has a PC on the <br>
desk. Larger departments are interconnected on two Novell/Ethernet LANs, <br>
and our camp (Pine Springs) is currently using Lantastic/Ethernet. (We'd <br>
like FDDI, but ...)<br>
<p>
My guess is that these people will first have to see the results of Local <br>
Email (they're still getting used to voice mail after a year!) and other <br>
networking goodies before they will jump for ATT Email, much less Internet. <br>
Perhaps as our LAN's enlarge, a critical mass will demand wider services.<br>
<p>
There are, of course, many other issues. For one, we at SECC still don't <br>
know why the GC chose ATT, but we do know that the discussions which took <br>
place several *years* ago didn't include us, or to our knowledge any local <br>
conference in the Pacific Union. The question now is, are we going to be <br>
locked into the ATT world by the GC? and what (cheap) mechanisms would get <br>
us into Internet? Did the GC ever consider *distributed* Internet <br>
addressing schemes?  Our local schools, and the elementary/secondary system <br>
at large seems captivated by Prodigy. Well, it is cheap.<br>
<p>
If nothing else you have provoked this SDAnetter to a few more serious <br>
conversations with local and union administrators, as well as some of the <br>
GC techies.<br>
<p>
Until next sunday's digest,<br>
<p>

Please feel free to either hold or throw away the message re:Gentry's halos. <br>
It was sent before I read your plea to stop.   There is more opinions where<br>
that came from if when the topic comes up again!  You and others already<br>
raised questions about the scientific validity of many of the assertions<br>

It should be remembered that Christ comes for each person in his/her lifetime.<br>
Effectivly, when one dies, Christ comes for them, because the next thing they<br>
will know is Christs coming.  From that point of view, with life being so fragile<br>
it makes total sense to belive that Christs coming is immenent, and to prepare<br>
for it.  It could happen any time to you.<br>

The best biblical support for a relation with Christ comes from texts such as<br>
John 15.  "Abiding" in Christ means a close union, a relation.  You might <br>
also look at the "in Christ" passages of Paul.<br>
<p>
This is perhaps a different way of speaking than we use now, but the meaning<br>
is quite the same, I think.<br>

<i>&gt; {Could someone</i><br>

<p>
Answering my own question 8-) ...:  PP299, 1T527, 2T108, 3T296, 4T531, 5T162.<br>
<p>
If memory serves ...  3T296 and PP299 read almost identically and speak of<br>
Aaron and Hur as being examples for how Israel should regard Moses.  1T527<br>
refers to evil surmisers in the church who would do better to follow<br>
Aaron &amp; Hur's example.  The remaining three are exhortations to serious<br>
intercessory prayer on behalf of pastors/leaders/burden bearers.  I found<br>
the latter two quite winsome, and will partially quote 4T531:<br>
<p>
{Joshua leading the army .. Moses "reaching his hands toward heaven and<br>
interceding in their behalf" .. "takes the whole matter to God in<br>
prayer" .. "pleading with the Lord" ..}<br>
"That prayer which comes forth from an earnest, believing heart is the<br>
effectual, fervent prayer that availeth much.  God does not always answer<br>
our prayers as we expect, for we may not ask what would be for our highest<br>
good; but in His infinite love and wisdom He will give us those things<br>
which we most need.  Happy the minister who has a faithful Aaron and Hur<br>
to strengthen his hands when they become weary and to hold them up by<br>
faith and prayer.  Such support is a powerful aid to the servant of Christ<br>
in his work and will often make the cause of truth to triumph gloriously."<br>
<p>
I think this answers the question as to whether the Aaron &amp; Hur metaphor<br>
applies to members supporting their pastor by prayer, etc.  I submit<br>
that we should pray earnestly for our pastors.  I see many attacks from<br>
Satan upon shepherds (Mt 26:31, a remarkable application of Zec 13:7).<br>
They need our intercessory prayers so that the dark clouds of confusion<br>
can be beaten back (note the struggle reported in Dan 10:11,12), so that<br>
they may have wisdom, understand truth, preach truth, and live the truth<br>
in purity and holiness (Ps 24:3,4; Eph 4:24, 1 Thess 4:7).<br>

The Great Controversy, in this sense, is being played out in an unlevel<br>

Internet access can also be had from delphi.  mail a note to  patrk@delphi.com.<br>
They have a variety of plans available.  Internet acces is a flat $3.00<br>
additional fee.  Their most attractive one seems to be the 20/20 plan.<br>
for $20.00 per month, you get 20 hours of connect time. additional hours<br>
are 1.80 per hour.  I think there is a trial setup.  dial 1-800-365-4636.<br>

Fortify her mind with the stories of Joseph, Daniel, Esther, Namaan's<br>
maid, and Moses.  Each one of these was taken away from godly parental<br>
influence at varying young (and sometimes tender) ages but stayed faithful.<br>
Get Quiet Hour's video "For Such a Time" (re Esther) and talk about<br>
the challenges she faced, the decisions she made, and their consequences.<br>
Claim Isa 54:13 and 49:25.  On becoming a prayer warrior, we found<br>
Mary Chapian's "Of Whom the World Was not WOrthy" insightful (and<br>
very interesting, given the current crisis in Yugoslavia).<br>

<p>
"Desire of Ages" makes some fairly specific statements about what sort of<br>
physical and moral-tendencies nature Christ inherited, based upon several<br>
texts of Scripture.  It also makes statements about His divine nature, such<br>
as He did not make use of it in battling temptation or even to perform<br>
miracles; that all victories/miracles were a manifestation of God's power,<br>
such as we also may benefit from.  I'm having difficulty matching what<br>
I've learned therein with "he was born without the separation from God<br>
that the rest of us inherit" (which would, in that respect, be identical<br>
to Adam pre-fall).  Perhaps I've overlooked something [*].  What is the<br>
Scriptural basis (fortified, presumably, with SoP material) for this claim?<br>
<p>
[*]  My wife and I were amazed in recently re-reading Patriarch's &amp; Prophets'<br>
     chapter "Seth and Enoch" that we had previously failed to grasp<br>
     several important principles of life.  I highly recommend a reading<br>
     of this during your next devotional time.<br>

Well let me start that I really don't know R.Larson too well.<br>
<p>
I have read two of his books ("Tell of His Power" and "The Word was Made Flesh"<br>
and the Issues pamphlet he wrote. I must agree with him with regard to his <br>
position regarding the fact that the SDA doctrines have been changed/ were <br>
changed in 1952 with the Walter Martin Saga.<br>
<p>
I am not really certain of what you refer to by <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; his methods of being openly critical and denunciatory toward the</i><br>
<i>&gt; denomination?</i><br>
<p>
Since as I said I don't know him very well niether am I exposed to<br>
what the situations are over in the US in which he is involved. So I can't <br>
really comment further. I have no first hand knowledge about what he is <br>
involved in. <br>
<p>
As far as the concept of a remnant within the SDA church, which is a major<br>
critism of all the independant ministries. All I can say is that there only<br>
ever was a remnant of Israel that was saved. and Paul tells us that that<br>
was an example for us who live in the last days. Obviously no all SDAs will<br>
be saved just like all evangelicals will not be saved.<br>

Fred's remarks are very pertinent. What expressions of concern equate<br>
to "damaging criticism" and what are constructive? Clearly there is a large<br>
grey area, and as Fred stated, those on the receiving end often feel<br>
hurt and criticized anyway.<br>
<p>
Still, there are some things going on around the place which are unquestionably<br>
damaging. One example is the publication and distribution of tracts and<br>
videos aimed specifically at destroying a person or institution's reputation.<br>
I was given a booklet last year, upon asking what it was the reply was "it's<br>
the truth, just read it". The booklet used quotations from the Bible and<br>
Ellen White to pointedly say that the SDA church organization is Babylon,<br>
and to come out of her. It was a harsh, damning indictment, no holds barred,<br>
and I could not see how it was constructive in any way.<br>
<p>
For another example, I'll quote from a letter I received this morning from<br>
my mother-in-law in Melbourne.<br>
<p>
"Some of these CBs go a bit over the top. Apparently there was an<br>
advertisement in the paper at Mildura that the person taking the church<br>
service on Sabbath (Eric Winter) was responsible for introducing<br>
hypnotism into the Adventist church in Australia, and to not attend that<br>
day. Dr. Salom got a mention too. They had obviously bought several<br>
newspapers, cut the advertisements out, and then when people went to Church<br>
Sabbath morning, they found these advertisements stuck over the doors and<br>
windows etc. Not a very impressive thing to do. Not very impressive either<br>
to publicize these matters. And dishonest. There is NOT hypnotism in the<br>
SDA church!"  etc. etc.<br>
<p>
It takes a fair bit to make my mother-in-law mad, but that surely did!<br>
Church leaders are publicly criticized for running seminars on improving your<br>
self-esteem, because Ellen White said that self-esteem is "a poisonous weed,<br>
to be rooted out." Another minister attends a seminar on outreach techniques,<br>
and is subsequently labelled a hypnotist.Conservative congregations are<br>
afraid to look the minister in the eye while he is preaching, just in case<br>
they are mesmerized, because that's what the trouble-makers have told them<br>
will happen.<br>
<p>
A third thing is the Osborn videos on celebration which were circulated here.<br>
 From what I've heard, these videos had scenes from SDA churches mixed in with<br>
scenes from over-the-top charismatic churches, and other such deceptive tricks.<br>
I'm afraid that such things really don't help their cause in my eyes.<br>
<p>
So yes, there are valid questions to be answered regarding what is and is not<br>
a suitable way to express concern, but at the same time there are some things<br>
going on which seem definitely unsuitable!<br>
<p>

Pre WWII, many Japanese worshipped their emperor as a god (one of several).<br>
After the defeat of Japan, Chrisitians there reported a great interest in<br>
Christianity.  Many people groups of old viewed defeat or victory in battle<br>
as indicating the failure or success of their god in battle with their<br>
foes' god (cf 1 Sam chs 4,5).  Evidently the attitude of many Japanese was<br>
very similar.  Who was this God of the West?  Pleas were made to the<br>
American Bible Study for several million Bibles and hundreds of<br>
missionaries.  Alas!, no one in the West was prepared for this and the<br>
pleas went largely  unanswered.  Instead, Japan learned Western culture<br>
and materialism.  {adapted from an IBLP publication; the writer's father<br>
was, if memory serves, chairman (or something like that) of the ABS at<br>
that time}<br>
<p>
Many formerly closed countries are opening up to the Gospel (and for how<br>
long?).  The number of gospel workers needed far exceeds the supply<br>
(Mt 9:37,38; John 4:35; Rev 14:15).<br>
<p>
I am reminded of the prayer fragment that Eric B Hare's mother taught<br>
him, roughly "I want to be a servant of God's, even to the four corners of<br>
the earth."  Prompted me to examine whether I'm teaching my children to<br>
be self-serving or self-denying.<br>
<p>
My kids are all book-worms, but I guess they come by it naturally.  I would<br>
like to have our library contain many inspiring books of great Christians,<br>
great missionaries.  Anyone have good titles on folk like Hudson Taylor,<br>
William Carey, Adoniram Judson (I have the Jr Guide issues from years<br>
ago but no book), David Livingstone, Mary Slessor, Robert Moffatt,<br>
John Paton, Jim Elliot, the founders of Solusi, etc? If you share the<br>
interest, here are two (of many) that we really like:<br>
    Treasures from the Haunted Pagoda, by Eric B Hare<br>
    Fulton's Footsteps in Fiji, by Eric B Hare<br>
<p>
Finally, I'd like to plug Adventist Frontier Missions (church planting<br>
in unentered areas).  These missionaries seem to live a lot closer to<br>
the level of the local people, altho perhaps not totally akin to folk<br>
with Wycliffe Bible Translators.  I count important.  My wife and I<br>
spent some time in Zaire, fresh from college, newly married, with little<br>
to our names by Western standards.  Yet we appeared quite well-to-do<br>
in the eyes of Zairians, and that was an impediment.<br>

<i>&gt;Well If we can't trust the bible and the H.S then who do you propose we follow</i><br>
<i>&gt;the majority or the traditions of our church leaders, or what ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
It seems rather paradoxical, but I don't think we CAN do better than to<br>
trust the Bible and the H.S., and make the best decisions that we are<br>
able to come to.  But I'm rather concerned about how the position this<br>
places us in, as far as making pronouncements about right and wrong,<br>
since there are very clear examples where groups of people have tried<br>
this, presumably in good faith, and come into direct conflict with each<br>
other.<br>
<p>
How to resolve the paradox?  The most common way is for each person to<br>
assume that s/he is right, and the other person is wrong.  After all,<br>
if you can't trust yourself, who can you trust?  The other way is NOT<br>
to trust yourself, but to be fair, you can't trust the other person<br>
either.  So what are you left with?  Well, not to coin a phrase, "you<br>
only know what you know".  (Are you reading this, Mazz?)  If you can't<br>
see the other person's point of view, and can't make them see yours,<br>
you just have to agree to disagree.  Just hope that their belief isn't<br>
that it is God's will that they have to kill you.<br>
<p>
To tie this in to the thread on America, I just happened to see part of<br>
one of the Sunday morning religious programs on the weekend.  (In case<br>
you're wondering how I managed to drag myself up at that hour on a<br>
Sunday, I'd actually been up all night, and just flicked it on out of<br>
idle curiosity.  And no, I had NOT been out on the town, it was real<br>
work.)  It happened to be Norman Schwarzkopf (sp?) talking about his<br>
experiences in Vietnam and the Gulf war.  He said that the best<br>
experience of his life was his first tour in Vietnam, because it was so<br>
wonderful to be fighting on the side of right.  Similarly, during the<br>
Gulf War, he said the feeling among the troups was that even if the<br>
Iraqis had had all their high-tech equipment and numerical advantages,<br>
they would still have won, because God was on their side.<br>
<p>
I'll resist commenting on the America-in-prophecy thread here, though<br>
it is no doubt relevant, but this sort of thing scares me silly,<br>
because, at least from listening to him for five minutes, there seems<br>
no doubt that this is what he really believes.  If you asked Saddam<br>
Hussein, I am sure he would be equally fervent in proclaiming his<br>
belief in his own divine appointment.  It's all well and good to say<br>
that at least one (or even both) are completely and utterly deluded,<br>
but they really and truly believe they are right.  So can we do any<br>
better than to draw OUR own conclusions, and trust OUR own judgement<br>
(which is presumably what they are doing)?  Of course, we study the<br>
Bible and ask the H.S. for guidance (which they have not necessarily<br>
done), but in the end, you make the decision for yourself.  We can say<br>
that they are deluded, but how do I know for sure that it is not me<br>
that is deluded?  It seems impossible to get entirely away from the<br>
interpreting process.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think what is taught by many now is along the lines of "Sin is living</i><br>
<i>&gt; your life independently of God in wilful rebellion against his authority."</i><br>
<i>&gt; And the when a human is born, the default is that they are not in a proper</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship with God, and that this must be remedied. Contrast with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original situation, where humans would have been born in a proper relationship</i><br>
<i>&gt; with God.</i><br>
<p>
Huh ? I was never aware of the original situation being as you express it.<br>
The original situation was the relationship of the child was dependant of the<br>
relationship of the parents with God.<br>
<p>
We can also be born with a fully intact relationship with God,<br>
<p>
What does God say regarding this matter ?<br>
<p>
Look at Luke 1:13-15,  Isa 59:2 and<br>
 <br>
Jeremiah 1:5 "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, .."<br>
<p>
NOT all are born separated from God.<br>
 <br>
What is it that separates us from God ?<br>
<p>
 "But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins<br>
    have hid His face from you, that He will not hear." Isa 59:2<br>
<p>
So if you say we are born separate from God it can only be because of original <br>
sin.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I have heard SDAs say that Hebrews does not speak about the geography of</i><br>
<i>&gt; heaven, although they do believe there is a heavenly sanctuary, and that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the priestly role of Christ changed in 1844. Does this constitute a vague</i><br>
<i>&gt; uncertainty? (not a rhetorical question btw)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I have heard ministers categorically deny that anything happened in 1844<br>
and that Jesus never went into the Most Holy Place at all and if He did<br>
it was at His ascention.<br>

<i>&gt; Something perhaps worthy of discussion is:  What distinguishes "helpful</i><br>
<i>&gt; and constructive" comment from "damaging" comment?  When one is on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the receiving end, it is often difficult to be objective.  Also, what</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinguishes "criticism" from 'expressing concern' or 'making a</i><br>
<i>&gt; heart-felt appeal'?  Since I think we are all willing to accept that</i><br>
<i>&gt; conference and institution leaders can and do make mistakes, how should</i><br>
<i>&gt; a concerned brother or sister relate? i.e., what characterizes a godly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Scripturally-based approach?</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- </i><br>
<p>
 It seems to me that all of the prophets and especially Jerimiah would have<br>
been prime candidates for CB-manship. <br>
<p>
You see Jerimiah was sooo critical of the leadership and the church that<br>
they decided to get rid of him. He was accusing them of every type of sin<br>
you could name, and worse than tht he was publishing evil reports about the <br>
church, that it would fall, they were very unhappy with the critical, divisive, <br>
and combative spirit that Jerimiah exhibited that they decided to <br>
disfellowshsip him.<br>
But that didn't work and so they decided to really rub him out, in the<br>
end the best they could do was to silence him up by sticking down a well.<br>
<p>
Talk about making damaging and destructive comments, Jerimiah was telling<br>
the church members to completely ignore the leadership because they were ALL<br>
apostates and telling them to stop supporting them. They did not like this<br>
one bit, talk about Ralf Larson, he is a kitty purring compared to Jerimiah's<br>
roaring. Jeremiah was making them look bad not only in the church but even<br>
to the outside world, What an unchristian man he was !!<br>
<p>
Jeremiah is the arch-CB, a role model for all contemporary CB's !:^) <br>
<p>
(how about we all go and read the story again some time ?)<br>
<p>
A bit like Elijah I would say (maybe he was the arch-CB), I mean even the <br>
conference president (who was trying to locate him for disfellowshipping)<br>
when he finally found him said "boy are you a trouble maker, look at all the<br>
divisivenes and lack of confidence in the leadership that you have brought<br>
into the church" Well in good CB combative spirit Elijah turns around and<br>
says "Not me, But YOU and the leadership, have brought this trouble upon<br>
yourselves" Take ThaT !!! And boy did the Gen. conference president like<br>
that, he was more determined than ever to get him. But anyway Elijah decided<br>
he wanted to call a show down. He was into those sort of things, you know<br>
expose it all into the open and really ridicule the apostates. Nothing<br>
like a bit of excitement to get the youth interested !!!<br>
<p>
Jesus says "Blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate<br>
you from their company, and shall reproach you and shall cast out your name as <br>
evil, for the Son of Man's sake. Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for<br>
behold your reward is great in heaven, for in like manner did their fathers<br>
unto the prophets."<br>
<p>
Notice of whom Jesus is speaking in these verses, it is not the world, but<br>
the church who did likewise unto the prophets.<br>
<p>
-----<br>
<p>
This little reality break, has been brought to you, to say that before we<br>
start jumping up and down like some did in the past when men arise saying<br>
things we don't like, that we should listen very carfully to see if there<br>
is any truth, however unpaletable in the message that they bring.<br>

<i>&gt; some of them came from India; but i read in Time magazine recently, that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Israel, there are a few families who migrated there and consider themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious Jews and not Christians, but who believe Yeshua is the messiah and</i><br>
<i>&gt; that He is coming again, also believe the New Testament, whlie observing all</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other Jewish coustoms and festivals (Sabbath, Yom Kippur, kosher laws,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Passover, Hanukkah, etc) but don't observe Easter or Christmas. (come to</i><br>
<i>&gt; that, i'm not sure why Christians obeserve these either)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yes there are quite a few of them in the USA and many of their congregations<br>
are generally affiliated with the Assemblies of God. They have their own <br>
news group on the net called alt.messianic<br>

<i>&gt; The opposite would be a broken relationship with God, which would lead to </i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong thoughts and attitudes and thus to wrong actions.  All three of</i><br>
<i>&gt; these levels would be sin, but it was all curable through a restoration</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the relationship with God.</i><br>
<p>
Did Adam have a right relationship with God ?<br>
<p>
Did Adam sin ?<br>
<p>
Was it a broken relationship that lead him to sin ?<br>
<p>
What did break Adam's relationship ?<br>
<p>
"But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins<br>
    have hid His face from you, that He will not hear." Isa 59:2<br>
<p>
No Adam did not sin because he had a bad relationship, it was his sin that<br>
broke a good relationship.<br>
<p>
Did Adam's broken relationship now mean he kept on sinning ?<br>
<p>
No Adam did not keep on sinning, he fixed the relationship and did not sin<br>
again after that.<br>

Dear Steve,<br>
<p>
This is one of the basics of so-called "reformed" theology.  Many<br>
evangelicals seem to believ as one poster said that SAtan is the ruler<br>
of this earth.  However, as part of the Great Commision speach given by<br>
Christ prior to HIs ascension, He said that all authourity on earth has<br>
been given unto Him.  Later in Romans, Paul ackowledges that not all<br>
things appear to be under the authourity of Christ, but they still are.  <br>
<p>
Christ is King of kings and Lord of lords.  If you want to send me your<br>
snail mail address, I can send you a copy of a pamphlet put out by the<br>
RPCNA that deals with the issue of how Christ is King.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;Larson seems unwilling to admit that Christ was in any way advantaged</i><br>
<i>&gt;over His fellow humans.  This makes it hard for him to show why it was </i><br>
<i>&gt;necessary for Christ to be divine, or why a savior ought to be divine.</i><br>
<p>
EGW categorically states that Jesus had NO advantage over us. So I can't <br>
see that as any major problem with Larsons understanding.<br>
<p>
Tell me what reason would you supply as a requirement for Jesus to be divine ?<br>
Remember that if it has soley to do with superior relationships any angel<br>
could have done the job as well. Jesus didn't use any power we don't have at<br>
our displosal in even greater quantities that He had.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; You can scarcely call the current mix Calvinistic, because Calvinists</i><br>
<i>&gt; are predestinarians, which no SDA's of any flavor are.  Nevertheless</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is antinomianism in the SDA church and Larson is right to call it</i><br>
<i>&gt; to task.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
When Larson refers to Calvinism he does not refer to Calvinism as understood<br>
in todays sense of the word. I once heard (read) somewhere his explaination<br>
of his usage the term Calvinistic. I think his thrust was that original<br>
Calvinism was rather different from todays version of it and was one of<br>
the two basic views of the gospel back in reformation days. You could choose<br>
from either the Calvinistic or the Armenian view point. Calvinism taught<br>
that one could never gain the victory over sin and so one must be saved in<br>
sin rather than from it. This of course also implied that Jesus could not<br>
have been like us and that in turn defined the nature of sin etc.<br>
The Armenian (ie from Armenius) view point was that one could obtain the <br>
victory over sin in the same way Jesus did. Therefore flowed the teaching<br>
that Jesus was in effect like us in all things which implied that sin<br>
is what de do not what we are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides those on the far left in SDA colonies, and Desmond Ford's crowd,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have not seen a wholesale rejection of the sanctuary doctrine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
No and the evangelicals don't reject it wholesale either they just think<br>
the whole thing is not particularly relevant and does'nt really have<br>
very many practical applications. I've never had any evangelical reject<br>
the doctrine of a heavenly sanctuary to me. That doesn't make them SDAs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The position being denied is that of various Review editors after the</i><br>
<i>&gt; death of Ellen G. White who built up the doctrine of verbal inspiration</i><br>
<i>&gt; in contradiction to her writings.  Perhaps this re-examination would not</i><br>
<i>&gt; have </i><br>
<i>&gt; taken place had not the Walter Rea controversy occured.  But I think </i><br>
<i>&gt; the re-examination is good for the church.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Q. What of the three levels of inspiration presented by Tony which would<br>
you suggest should be applied in EGW's case, plenary or encounter inspiration ?<br>

America being a wolf in lambs clothing isn't new.  You don't even have to get<br>
biblical support for it.  Just ask Native Americans, and other colonized places<br>
like Panama.  Of course other countries are beasts too, and there are other<br>
victims in those cases.<br>
<p>
But I guess what is supposed to make us different is that "lambs clothing"<br>
some would call it drag.  I'm curious as to what the "lamb-likeness" thing is<br>
all about.  What are the exact actions, ideologies etc. which make "it" seem<br>
harmless, before it "undresses" or stops acting like a lamb?<br>
<p>
Poor over exposed Billy Ray isn't the only one.  There are others more<br>
cunning, less questioned: Pat Robertson and all the brain children he's now<br>
spinning off; Lou Sheldon; nice people who do some nice things - sometimes.<br>

This is intended to be quite a specific question rather than a broad "theories<br>
of inspiration" one.<br>
<p>
Some have referred to Ellen White's early visions as the original great<br>
controversy visions. She reports seeing and experiencing many events from<br>
the beginning of time right through, all the while accompanied by her angel<br>
guide and friend. Such was the realism of the experience at times that, once<br>
the vision was over, she stated that she felt homesick for heaven.<br>
<p>
Now some of the things she saw were clearly allegorical, such as the steep<br>
winding path with the light at the bottom and Jesus at the top. With other<br>
things it's harder to tell.<br>
<p>
My question is, do we have a means to distinguish between an actual<br>
"historical" (past or future) event which she was shown, and an allegorical<br>
image? Does she distinguish clearly herself? Do we try to err on the side<br>
of assuming things are historical?<br>
<p>
This question is not addressed towards the issue of discrepancies between<br>
Ellen White and professional historians, by the way. Those don't bother me,<br>
but there are some other things that I need to sort out!<br>
<p>
Looking forward to your replies...<br>
<p>
Tony<br>

Human nature of Christ:<br>
Christ was born with the same type of physical infirmities and inherited <br>
tendencies that anyone at the time he lived would have.<br>
<p>
Christ overcame sin with the same power from God that is available to <br>
every believer for the asking.<br>
<p>
Human nature of people:<br>
It is observed, that, original sin or no, every human that has ever lived<br>
has sinned, and that fairly soon after birth.  So the question of<br>
imputed guilt is moot, whether sin be relationship-breaking or action,<br>
everyone has done it except Jesus Christ himself  (Rom 3:23).<br>
<p>
Human nature of Christ:<br>
It is obvious that Christ did not do so, but nevertheless was capable of<br>
doing so (what does this mean to those who say that God cannot sin?).<br>
<p>
The gospel: <br>
Christ is willing to make the power that was available to Him available<br>
to all of us, so victory over sin can be ours.<br>
<p>
We see that independent of any possible differences in nature, there is<br>
certainly a difference in behavior between Christ and any other human<br>
being that has ever lived.  So we ask:  What made this difference?<br>
<p>
1)  Was Christ born with what we are not--an unbroken relationship with God?<br>
Did he have from the beginning what we acquire only once we are born again?<br>
Was that which becomes second nature for us first nature for Him?  <br>
<p>
I believe so, and believe such a view is consistent with all the points <br>
of agreement above.<br>
<p>
But there are at least two other options:<br>
<p>
2)  Christ was born with the same broken relationship as the rest of us<br>
and by some miracle was able to be "born again" before the natural "gimme"<br>
reflexes of infancy began to manifest themselves.<br>
<p>
3)  Everyone is born with an intact relationship with God, just Christ was<br>
the only one not to blow it.<br>
<p>
The difficulty I have relating to the positions presented here is that<br>
most of those who are telling me that Christ was human enough to be my<br>
example<br>
aren't explaining how He is divine enough to be my Savior.  I think we're<br>
getting somewhere with this discussion--let's keep it up.<br>

Ruben points out that Adam is one who began with a perfect relationship<br>
to God.  He quotes the text "iniquities have separated you from God."<br>
However, let's examine it closely.  Adam's sin didn't begin with eating<br>
the fruit.  The first sin Adam made was to doubt God, and as soon as this<br>
happened, his relationship with God was not in working order.  The <br>
sin of action followed.  So the iniquity did indeed separate Adam from God,<br>
but the separation happened well before the fruit was munched.  Read<br>
Patriarchs and Prophets with regard to this.   I would, but my library<br>
is trapped in Pittsburgh.  (I'll get there next weekend.)<br>
<p>
As to whether Adam sinned again or not, we have no record of that.  Any<br>
statement on that account is mere speculation.<br>

As quoted from the previous post, "The authors conclude that although the<br>
boomers might want flexibility in their worship, they definitely also want<br>
some well-defined moral and religious boundaries."<br>
<p>
"I find this last observation of special interest in view of some recent<br>
pressures for the SDA church to "relax" some of our standards in order to<br>
reach out to groups like the boomers."<br>
<p>
This looks like an excellent topic for discussion.  What are the "standards"<br>
which define us as a people.  Should we have behavioral standards which are<br>
required as tests of fellowhip?  (Non-smoking for example.)  If so, why,<br>
considering the crowd of "sinners", tax collectors, prostitutes and societal<br>
dropouts that Jesus ran around with.  If not, why not considering the advice<br>
of Jesus in Matthew 18 about how to deal with those who are sinners and the<br>
advice of Paul (see for example his vigorous comments in Corinthians 5:<br>
9-13).  <br>
<p>
I look forward to your comments,<br>

It seems some of SDANet posters are somewhat vehement in their statements.<br>
I've decided simply not to read some of them because I get upset at how they<br>
rant on, often about things they do not really know too much about.  I fear<br>
that the simplest way to lose an audience is to come on too strong.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the Christian graces of Galatians 5 belong in our discussions also.<br>
<p>
At least, let's think about that.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
Ruben asks why Christ's nature needed to have a divine component (is this the <br>
right way to say it?) while on earth.  The obvious (?) answer relates to the <br>
scope of His sacrifice.  It seems to me that only a divine being (namely the <br>
creator) could make atonement for the sins of ALL men.  I can make atonement<br>
for my own.  This atonement would entail my eternal death, for such is the <br>
paycheck which is due me for my sin.  I cannot atone for anyone else's sin.<br>
<p>
This point has been made by others.  Now I want to throw the ball back in <br>
Ruben's court now.  Aside from His sinless life, what was special about <br>
Christ, if not the fact that He became the only God-man to ever walk this <br>
earth?  There was something special about Christ's birth (born of a virgin).<br>
If His nature was in no way different than ours, why was He not born through<br>
a normal sexual union?<br>

It's not that I don't agree with what Steven cites as things everyone<br>
agrees on....  It's just that I have questions:<br>
<p>
On Tue, 6 Apr 1993, Steven Timm wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Human nature of Christ:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christ was born with the same type of physical infirmities and inherited </i><br>
<i>&gt; tendencies that anyone at the time he lived would have.</i><br>
<p>
I am in full agreement with this statement, based on my reading of<br>
Scripture and Mrs. White's commentaries.  But alas, it's not the physical<br>
or genetic attributes that we are mainly concerned about -- it's Christ's<br>
spiritual standing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Christ overcame sin with the same power from God that is available to </i><br>
<i>&gt; every believer for the asking.</i><br>
<p>
OK, but I have these very innocent questions:  Does this mean that we too<br>
can "tap" into this "power" and overcome exactly as Christ overcame?  And<br>
if so, what was the point of the Atonement?  And if so, why couldn't Adam<br>
have "tapped" into it sufficient to prevent the Fall or to remedy the Fall?<br>
What about Lucifer and his access to this "power"?  And what power is it,<br>
anyway, and what relationship does this power have to the Atonement?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Human nature of people:</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is observed, that, original sin or no, every human that has ever lived</i><br>
<i>&gt; has sinned, and that fairly soon after birth.  So the question of</i><br>
<i>&gt; imputed guilt is moot, whether sin be relationship-breaking or action,</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone has done it except Jesus Christ himself  (Rom 3:23).</i><br>
<p>
Humbly, I ask: if there is no "imputed sin" then each of us has the<br>
potential to become our own "savior," is this not so?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Human nature of Christ:</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is obvious that Christ did not do so, but nevertheless was capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing so (what does this mean to those who say that God cannot sin?).</i><br>
<p>
I would say that He placed Himself in the same position as Adam before the<br>
Fall (spiritually-speaking) and was "capable" of sin, but was not<br>
naturally inclined or disposed toward sin as we are.  Thus, Christ is<br>
referred to in the NT as the Second Adam.  He proved that Adam need not<br>
have fallen -- is this not correct?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The gospel: </i><br>
<i>&gt; Christ is willing to make the power that was available to Him available</i><br>
<i>&gt; to all of us, so victory over sin can be ours.</i><br>
<p>
Is not the power to have victory over sin DERIVED from Christ's own<br>
victory over sin?  Isn't it because of Christ's perfect life and atoning<br>
death that He qualifies to grant us by grace His perfection to take the<br>
place of our own "filthiness"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We see that independent of any possible differences in nature, there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly a difference in behavior between Christ and any other human</i><br>
<i>&gt; being that has ever lived.  So we ask:  What made this difference?</i><br>
<p>
I have been of the opinion that Christ's "difference" was simply that He<br>
did not suffer the same "propensity" toward sin (as per the famous Baker<br>
letter statement) that developed post-fall.  I don't feel He could have<br>
and yet been the spotless Lamb who did not need to be sacificed for His<br>
own sin but rather who gave his pure life as a sacrifice "without spot and<br>
without blemish."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; most of those who are telling me that Christ was human enough to be my</i><br>
<i>&gt; example</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't explaining how He is divine enough to be my Savior.  I think we're</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting somewhere with this discussion--let's keep it up.</i><br>
<p>
I sense a danger in making Christ "altogether one as ourselves."  Yes, He<br>
was fully human.  Yes, he suffered in all things as we suffer.  He felt<br>
our pain and our sin laid upon Him who knew no sin.  <br>
<p>
I also see a problem with attributing Christ's victory to an external<br>
force and then suggesting that any human, by tapping into this external<br>
force, can win out their victory.  I believe we are saved by accepting<br>
Christ's victory on our behalf by faith -- not by trying to tap into a<br>
"power" that will "help" us to reproduce His accomplishments.<br>
<p>
But please, I am a student....  Let me hear your thoughts.<br>

Will the real CB please stand up !<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<p>
The expression CB is generally used to describe a large segment<br>
of historic Adventists. Due to the noncomplimentary way in which<br>
the expression is used toa label people some say that it applies<br>
only to those SDAs which are critical and negative about the church<br>
organisation. In many cases it is used to tar all conservatives with<br>
the same brush.<br>
<p>
Where did the expression originate from ? During the mid '70s when<br>
Dr Des Ford was in his element at Avondale College certain leading<br>
ministers called the attention of the division to the distorted<br>
doctrines which Ford was openly teaching. The division chose to cover<br>
up the issue and make certain underhanded moves in order to do so. Many <br>
leading ministers some of which were retired wrote a letter of <br>
protest to the division regarding the way in which the matter was being <br>
handled. They signed their names following the expression "the concerned <br>
bretheren".  It was only latter that any action was taken regarding Ford.<br>
I have personally read the letter and know which are the ministers who<br>
signed the letter, these men were very well respected and leading ministers<br>
at all levels of the organisation. They were not negative or critical<br>
but wanted truth to be brought out into the open and dealt with.<br>
<p>
Now we are told that CB's refers to the extreme radical elements in the church.<br>
I'm not sure how these men, the original CB's would appreciate the usage of <br>
label. It is true that there are some radical and extreme elements in<br>
the church but these have very little in common with the principles and<br>
actions cherished by the true concerned bretheren.<br>

<i>&gt; As far as the concept of a remnant within the SDA church, which is a major</i><br>

<p>
I would agree to a degree, but...just to clarify my position:<br>
<p>
Using your analogy of Israel, I liken Israel (the claimed followers of Christ)<br>
to the Christian world today (all brands and flavors...who claim to be followers<br>
of Christ...hence Christians), not just SDAs.  So as you point out, only a remnant<br>
of Israel was saved, so only a remnant of the Christian world today will be saved.<br>
This would include a remnant of the present day SDA church along with a remnant of<br>
the other present day churches (all brands/flavors).  I say "present day" because<br>
I can not say what changes the SDA church will go through between now and the last<br>
day prior to Christ's 2nd coming...we know the shaking time will certainly weed out<br>
a few.<br>

Does everyone or I should say a vast majority of adventists believe in the<br>

<i>&gt; Steve Timm Writes:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Christ overcame sin with the same power from God that is available to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; every believer for the asking.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Does everyone or I should say a vast majority of adventists believe in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; complete overcoming of all sin in this life thorugh the power of God?</i><br>
<p>
My reading of Scripture and SoP indicates it is possible and indeed<br>
desirable and should be our aim.  Witness the lives of Enoch, Moses,<br>
and Elijah.  Would it be valid to claim:<br>
  Only those who, from the Fall until the close of probation, have removed<br>
  all sin from their lives will be saved?<br>
I hesitate on that one (have not studied this out thoroughly, weighing<br>
all refs in their contexts); one will not know for sure (I'm thinking<br>
of EGW's description of folk during the time of Jacob's trouble).  Would<br>
it be valid to claim:<br>
  All those who, from the Fall until the close of probation, in the eyes<br>
  of God, are earnestly seeking to overcome all sin in their lives and<br>
  in whom the trend is victory rather than defeat, will be saved? (cf<br>
  John 16:8; 1 Pet 4:17; Lam 3:40; esp Ps 139:23,24 for some add'l tho'ts)<br>
<p>
I'm more comfortable with the latter at this point.  Regardless, I submit<br>
that overcoming sin by the blood of the Lamb is one characteristic of those<br>
who love His appearing (1 Tim 4:8), who desire His character (actions,<br>
attitudes, motives (Jer 17:10), methods, words, thoughts (2 Cor 10:5;<br>
Phil 2:5), etc) to be fully reflected in theirs, who thirst after<br>
righteousness, who accept His Lordship, who hold nothing back, who<br>
want a new heart (Rom 2:15; 2 Cor 3:3; Heb 8:10, 10:16,22; Jer 31:33),<br>
who humble themselves under God's hand, who fear the Lord, who behold<br>
Jesus only, who abide in Christ, whose hearts are teachable; those in whom<br>
the Holy Spirit dwells.<br>
<p>
I note a recurring theme in Scripture (e.g., Ps chs 18, 24) re clean hands<br>
and pure heart, echoed in SoP (e.g., Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel<br>
Workers).  Also themes re the Day of Atonement, esp as were are living<br>
in the antitypical (Lev 16, Dan 8:14).  Themes on holiness and<br>
overcoming also abound.<br>

If you have read the first two chapters of Job in conjunction with the<br>
sabbath school lesson, you may have notice the phrase "the sons of God".<br>
In my sabbath school class my teacher went off on a tangent and asked if<br>
we thought the sons of God like we do. After all, Adam was a son of God.<br>
I answered no, just as I believe that angels may not look as we portray them<br>
(men with wings). After class I was asked by a visiting adventist what would<br>
be the purpose of creating other beings in an image different from God's.<br>
Of course I have no answer for that question, but I still beleive that the <br>
being (sons of God) on other planets do not have to look like us. Plus we<br>
have been changed because of sin. So, when we recieve new bodies, we may not<br>
look exactly like we do now.<br>
<p>
Let here your thoughts on the matter.<br>

What was his "sin", in this case?<br>
<p>
A relationship does not cause sin but can indicate how susceptible you might be to<br>
sin.  A weak relationship with God can certainly lead to sin but a healthy<br>
relationship can help prevent alot of falling down.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Did Adam's broken relationship now mean he kept on sinning ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; No Adam did not keep on sinning, he fixed the relationship and did not sin</i><br>

<p>
Do we know for a fact that Adam did not keep on sinning?<br>

Just what the title says this is the official report.<br>
<p>
Don't ask me, I'm going to make many people happy and reduce<br>
bandwidth wastage :^) no more of Ruben's ramblings for a while,<br>
cause I'm going on holidays. Hehehehe :)<br>
<p>
Anyway just had to post some excepts from the offical guidelines on how<br>
to eradicate those evil CB's :^) !!! (Get in before they're gone !)<br>
<p>
In the mean while as my parting gesture I just felt the urge to waste<br>
some more bandwidth, So here goes......<br>
<p>
----------------<br>
<p>
PREAMBLE - It is clear from report received that the dissension caused by many<br>
independent ministries is wide-spread, with a great many of our churches <br>
being affected. In assessing the current situation, it is apparent that:<br>
<p>
1. There is confusion over what each independent ministry espouses.<br>
2. Confusion is created by linking truth with error, and the misquoting of <br>
	Scripture and Spirit of Prophecy.<br>
3. Independent groups have a strategy which focuses on,<br>
	a. interests and new members,<br>
	b. young people<br>
	c. the Church, not outreach to the community.<br>
<p>
4. The attitude of intolerance and criticism is more destructive than teaching.<br>
5. Their basis of authority is Ellen White and perceived "historic Adventism".<br>
6. The plan of not addressing the challenges and concerns created by these<br>
   groups over the past decade and not responding to their insidious <br>
   literature has not worked .<br>
7. Their main method of disseminating their propaganda is by the distribution <br>
   of literature, videos and tapes through person-to-person networking and mail.<br>
8. If we do not pro-actively address the situation the Church runs the very <br>
   real risk of losing more good ministers who are becoming broken in health <br>
   and spirits along with a large number of disillusioned and discouraged <br>
   members.<br>
<p>
IDENTIFYING THE ISSUES<br>
<p>
Following are the main issues and areas of concern that independent ministries<br>
seem to highlight and emphasize:<br>
<p>
A. Theological<br>
<p>
1. Nature of Christ; Righteousness by faith, justification and sanctification;<br>
   Perfection; Eschatology - Sunday laws, etc.; Nature of sin.<br>
2. Nature of inspiration~versions and translations; Role, function and authority<br>
   of Ellen White; Ecclesiology - authority of the Church/remnancy.<br>
3. History of Adventism and Adventist doctrine; Fundamentals, landmarks.<br>
4. Sanctuary, 1844, landmarks.<br>
5. Ecumenicalism and relation to other churches; Standards of the Church.<br>
<p>
B. Church Related<br>
<p>
1. Lack of distinctive, prophetic, historic Adventist preaching; Good News<br>
	Unlimited teachings.<br>
2. Worship, celebration; Lab I and II, N.L.P., Hypnotism.<br>
3. Lack of leadership and apostasy at all levels (including corporate); Use of<br>
	tithe.<br>
4. Church Manual [this was italisized]<br>
<p>
<p>
STRATEGY<br>
<p>
In an endeavor to address the current situation as outlined above and educate <br>
the Adventist community to a proper understanding of the issues, it is<br>
<p>
RECOMMENDED: That<br>
<p>
<p>
[... whole bits left out... ]<br>
<p>
<p>
3g. Asking the [omitted to protect the guilty] Division and [your favorite]<br>
    College to review curriculum content to assess whether:<br>
<p>
	i. In primary and secondary education courses a reliable foundation is<br>
	   being laid for an understanding of inspiration and other identified<br>
	   topics of importance.<br>
<p>
	ii. At [as above] College students in all courses, especi theology, are<br>
	   adequately informed on the key issues, the development of our <br>
	   doctrines and how to relate to the key doctrines biblicallY~<br>
<p>
<p>
4. Continued divisiveness caused my many private organizations and individuals <br>
   be addressed in a proper way which could, and in some cases should, include:<br>
<p>
a. Conferences arranging elders' and ministers' meetings to explain the actions,<br>
   etc., of such groups or itinerant preachers.<br>
<p>
b. Encouraging pastors to keep elders and church boards informed of conflict<br>
   caused by private organizationspersons and steps taken to resolve the<br>
   problems.<br>
<p>
c. Leadership extending an invitation to private organizations to share in<br>
   constructive discussion with a view to resolving differences and issues,<br>
   making surge that in particular the instruction given in Matthew 18 is <br>
   followed, and<br>
<p>
FURTHER: That a copy of Dr Phandl's article entitled "Conflict Resolution in<br>
the Light of the New Testament" to be distributed to ministers and elders, and<br>
FURTHER: If there is no co-operation and reconciliation with private<br>
persons/organisation~, that churches to be encouraged to take the necessary<br>
actions outlined in Scripture.<br>
<p>
[Hey we all know what this means don't we :^) ]<br>
<p>
d. Administration at local conference supporting ministers by endorsing hard<br>
   decisions taken by a local church in respect to such organizations or<br>
   individuals and, in extreme circumstances, and where thought necessary,<br>
   administratively recording by an official executive committee action, the<br>
   conference[']s attitude when a local church refuses or fails to address    <br>
   critical and divisive issues.<br>
<p>
[ This one is even better ]<br>
<p>
5c. Compiling a profile for each independent group or individual operating <br>
   outside the recognized framework of the Church. and that this responsibility<br>
   be assigned to the Division Ministerial Association Secretary.<br>
<p>
6f. Establishing contacts in the [I'm not telling] division and the General<br>
   Conference with agreement that all developments and actions relative to<br>
   private organizations be passed on to this Division for updating elders and<br>
   ministers.<br>
<p>
g. Recommending to the General Conference that the section in the Church Manual<br>
   dealing with church business meetings be rewritten to exclude as voting <br>
   members those that no longer attend church, and ask that they define more<br>
   definitively those who are classified as being "in good and regular    <br>
   standing"<br>
<p>
[I really like this one]<br>
<p>
7b. Keep under review the theology. attitude. activity and promotional<br>
   methods of the different independent ministries operating within the <br>
   territory of the [guess who] Division, with the view of resolving areas of <br>
   misunderstanding and potential conflict and suggesting appropriate action <br>
   when deemed necessary. Power to act and recommend to Division Executive <br>
   Committee.<br>
<p>
c. Develop and implement ongoing strategies and programmer of ministry to<br>
   educate both ministers and church members in those specific areas promoted<br>
   by independent ministry groups which generate misunderstanding of the<br>
   doctrines of the Church and their historical development, or have the <br>
   potential to, or which may cause members t.o lose confidence in the Church <br>
   and its leadership. Power to act and recommend to Division Executive <br>
   Committee.<br>
<p>
d. Appraise various independent ministries and recommend for registration those<br>
   considered to be SUPPORTIVE and review as necessary the guidelines and<br>
   protocol for approving such groups. Power to act and recommend to Division<br>
   Executive Committee.<br>
<p>
<p>
-------------<br>
(Arn't you all lucky you don't know the other half of the story :)<br>
<p>
I won't be answering any questions on the above material so don't ask me !!<br>
<p>
Enjoy my absence, while it lasts, 'cause I'll be back, bigger and better :^)<br>

I recently was talking to a friend of mine and telling him about how<br>
widespread the missionary work of the SDA Church was.  He then brought up<br>
the question about what we do about giving the Bible to some of the groups<br>
we meet; in other words, if we encounter a group who has a foreign<br>
lanaguage and no Bible in their language what  do we do?  Ian.<br>

[From Ruben Gonzalez]<br>
<i>&gt; So the iniquity did indeed separate Adam from God,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but the separation happened well before the fruit was munched.  Read</i><br>
<p>
<p>
BUT That was not sin, the angles in heaven also doubted God but did not<br>
[were these the acute angles of heaven or the obtuse angles that doubted? :)]<br>
sin. Many of them returned to loyalty without having committed sin.<br>
Adam did not sin until he ate the apple.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As to whether Adam sinned again or not, we have no record of that.  Any</i><br>
<i>&gt; statement on that account is mere speculation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Oh yes we have a fairly good account. Read EGW's decription of Adams <br>
relationship with God after the fall and how much he despised the sin he<br>
had committed. I can't beleive you would suggest that Adam wanted to<br>
keep on sinning and/or that he was unable to overcome !<br>
[Nor should you believe that, because I suggested no such thing.  SCT]<br>

RE GC/Email<br>
<p>
---&gt;<br>
<p>
There are, of course, many other issues. For one, we at SECC still don't<br>
know why the GC chose ATT, but we do know that the discussions which took<br>
place several *years* ago didn't include us, or to our knowledge any local<br>
[From Ralf Simonsson<br>
&lt;-----<br>
<p>
I would not think the system is the crucial issue, as all relevant<br>
e-mail systems<br>
ar/is going to be interconnected. In an international view I think itr <br>
is important that you choose the e-mail system where you have as many contacts<br>
as possible. You are not supposed to communicate with SDAnet or GC alone,<br>
you have many more local and professionalspecific contacts you need to<br>
maintain.<br>
That means that in any country you should normally use the mainstream<br>
email-system<br>
as Compuserve in US and GOLD400 in UK.<br>
Educational environment would profit most if Internet of course<br>
RSi<br>
<p>
[I think the allure of ATTmail for the gC people is that there are <br>
many local call numbers to which they can dial up and get their<br>
messages whilst on the road, since Podunkville, Iowa is not yet equipped<br>
with an Internet spigot into which they can insert their portable<br>
X-terminals.  SCT]<br>

[From Noe Torres]<br>
I too am having difficulty making the distinction between "Adam's<br>
separation from God" and "Adam's guilt."  Isn't sin, by definition, a<br>
separation from God -- a breach in trust?  How else could Adam have been<br>
separated from God?  I've always believed in "original sin," meaning that<br>
from conception we are born under the effects of the transgression of our<br>
first parents.  Subsequently we add our own transgressions (plural) to the<br>
"original" transgression to which we are all subject.  If this were not<br>
the case, then every human being would be "without sin" until such time as<br>
he/she deliberately and willfully committed a sin, and thus every human<br>
being would have the potential to become his/her own saviour.  Alas,<br>
Christ need not have died....<br>
<p>
NOE.<br>

[I would say the vast majority of SDA's have never thought about this 
issue one way or the other.  There is certainly a group of SDA's that 
think the transformation of character occurs only at the 2nd coming.
We have had this discussion at length before here, so I suppose that it 
is not correct to put that statement as a consensus.  But what I am trying
to show is that even if Christ had some advantage over us (He certainly did
not have to be "born again.") overcoming is possible all the same.  SCT]

Ruben has brought up the verse several times that iniquities separate<br>
us from God.  I'm not a Greek scholar, and I don't have a Strong's handy.<br>
But I seem to remember that there are shades of meaning between "iniquities",<br>
"transgressions", "sins", and several other things that we would consider <br>
synonyms.  In particular, the word for iniquities has to do with a lack of <br>
faith in God, if I remember correctly.  Can someone check me on this?<br>
<p>
Also, someone made a reference to the "Baker Letter" which has frequently <br>
been quoted by those who want to counter the viewpoints of those who<br>
would say Christ was exactly like humans.  I have read this letter but<br>
again don't have it handy.  If someone does have the text of this letter<br>
available and can summarize it, I'd be much obliged.<br>

Tony asked:  What should be the distinctive features of the SDA church?<br>
I answer:  The same as those of the church in Acts.  Acts 4:13 "...they were<br>
marveling, and began to recognize them as having been with Jesus."<br>
<p>
Note that many other signs also characterized the NT church.  These<br>
included manifestations of all the gifts of the Spirit, but more<br>
important, unity <br>
of mind and purpose.  Also a phenomenal spiritual authority exercised<br>
by the apostles--Sapphira lies and is immediately struck down dead.<br>
There were also standards:  Abstain from fornication, from things<br>
offered to idols, from things strangled, and from blood.  But I think<br>
these all derived<br>
from the first distinctive, knowing and spending time with Jesus.<br>
<p>
Keith Green once said  "Going to church doesn't make you a Christian<br>
any more than going to McDonald's makes you a hamburger."  The traditional <br>
distinctives that have set SDA's apart are necessary, but they are good only<br>
if once people look at us, the distinctive people, they see a reflection<br>
of Christ.<br>

The ongoing discussion of defining "conservatives," "liberals," "concerned <br>
brethren," etc., has left me with a new label to ponder. I have been a member <br>
of the SDA church for close to twenty years. I attended SDA schools from the <br>
7th grade through college, but had never heard the term "Historic Adventism" <br>
until several months ago when our congregation was searching for a new pastor.<br>
What is "Historic Adventism?" How does this differ from, what I must assume is<br>
the opposite, "Modern Adventism?" <br>

Good point.  Remember that the Bible was written by men, and given by GOD<br>
for man's education.  Therefore it is inherantly biased toward man.  It is<br>
quite problable that other beings in Gods universe are different.  After all,<br>
GOD made man in HIS image.  It says nothing else.  God likes variety, and <br>
afterall there are many other configurations of matter that are just as<br>
versatile as man's.  I'm looking forward to meeting a whole universe of<br>
diffrent beings.  We already know that certain classes of angles have<br>
four heads, 8 wings, four sets of arms, and apparently some very strange<br>
feet.  So why shouldn't GOD have created other configurations of sentient beings?<br>

----&gt;<br>
Does being born separate from God mean that one is born in a "lost" condition ?<br>
if so, then it means the same as original sin.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
The results thereof perhaps, but the "original sin" description given by<br>
Ruben is one I've never come across within the SDA church. It seems that<br>
this original sin concept which is being invoked is a little semantical.<br>
After all, the Scripture says that by one man sin was brought into the world,<br>
and by one man it will be removed. This could probably be termed "original<br>
sin" if it wasn't for the fact that others have created a meaning for the<br>
term that goes beyond the two words in the phrase.<br>
<p>
Just a thought, some of those who hold Ruben's view that a human is born<br>
"saved", or I should say is not born "lost", also believe that life begins<br>
at conception. Perhaps abortion is not so bad after all???<br>

Through God all things are possible, a very well-known text, so I would<br>
say that yes, a vast majority of Adventists do believe that it is possible<br>
for a complete overcoming of all sin in this life through the power of God.<br>
(I think I know what was meant by "all sin" in this question.)<br>
<p>
Do they believe that it can happen for them as individuals? Deep down I <br>
think a lot of us have instinctive doubts, even if the beliefs we have<br>
chosen to adopt tell us otherwise.<br>
<p>
Do they believe it *will* come about? Do they believe it *should*? Do they<br>
believe it absolutely *has to* or they cannot be rescued from this world?<br>
Do they believe others have overcome sin (through Christ's power) in the<br>
past?<br>
<p>
Belief and practice...if only the two were more synonymous, more easily.<br>
Even some who claim to believe in this salvation by faith (from sin, not ini<br>
it) seem very preoccupied by all kinds of little things, and let this<br>
"overcoming" take precedence even over other aspects of their Christian<br>
witness.<br>

Could someone show me a text or EGW quotation that states that it is necessary<br>
for us to understand what kind of human nature Christ had in order that we<br>
may live a victorious life??<br>

Could someone show me a text or EGW quotation that states that the kind of<br>
human nature that Christ had is to be the content of God's message to a<br>

Hi,<br>
<p>
A few weeks ago I attended a Portland area week-end with Ralph Larsen.<br>
I thought it was one of the best week-ends in a long time.  He stuck<br>
to his topics using Bible and EGW.  He was not there to attack the<br>
church.  He did point out that certain Calvinistic doctrines are<br>
being more and more accepted in our church and then used lots of Bible<br>
and some SOP to debunk these theologies.  Some might call that<br>
"attacking the church".  But how do you set the record straight on<br>
popular doctrines if you don't identify them and deal with them.<br>
He was not calling out names and he was not running out dirty laundry<br>
on people.<br>
<p>
True, some of the independents do name names and their dirty deeds.<br>
I don't think that is necessary and so I was most appreciative<br>
Larsen's approach that week-end.<br>
<p>
Friend,<br>
<p>
Dave<br>

I apologize for using the term CB in this discussion...I didn't realize<br>
so many messages would be required to sort out what CB means!<br>
<p>
For those of you who wish to know what I meant when I said CB in my<br>
original question, refer to *my* definition of "CB". For those wishing<br>
to know how the term originated, and what it really *should* refer to<br>
(as opposed to what it often does), read Ruben's definition! I don't<br>
think I'll use the term again myself, it seems prone to be misunderstood<br>
in one way or another!<br>

those who respect the writings of Ellen White:<br>
<p>
Christ's perfect humanity is that which all His followers may possess,<br>
if they will be in subjection to God as He was.<br>
<p>
When we know God as it is our privilege to know him, our lives will be<br>
lives of continual obedience.<br>
<p>
<p>
And there are many more like them.<br>
<p>

This argument is not clear for you assume that an individual who does not <br>

is is some of this guilt passed to us as a result of Adam's transgression.<br>
<p>
Next if someone does not commit a sin, he fulfilled the law from birth you <br>
say that he would be guilty anyway.  This is only telling us the definition<br>
of original sin.<br>
<p>
So what you are saying is original sin is true because original sin is true.<br>
In other words you are saying that there is an original transgression (Adam's)<br>
of which<br>
we are guilty,  because if we were to live our life without sin we would still<br>
have Adam's transgression counted against us.  That is circular reasoning.<br>

I am sorry, but I find it hard to believe that Adam was without sin<br>
after the initial fall.  It is mere speculation to believe otherwise. <br>
Take a close look at the passage, and you will see that there were other<br>
occasions of sin around that same episode.<br>
<p>
Adam was with Eve throughout the entire episode.  Yet he allowed Eve to<br>
be the spokesperson about the things of God, abdicating his role as<br>
spiritual head over the family.  He allowed Eve to eat the fruit, while<br>
he stood right by her.  Then he ate some of the fruit himnself.<br>
<p>
Then confrontation time.  When God confronts Adam, he first blames the<br>
woman for his sin, and then finally blames God for putting the woman<br>
there in the first place.  This does not sound like a man who is<br>
repentant.  And since Scripture says that if we train up a child in the<br>
way that he should go, he will not depart from it when older, take a<br>
look at Cain.  If Adam no longer sinned after the fall, where did Cain<br>
get such an example to live his life by?  <br>

Greetings,<br>
<p>
What do all of you believe happened to the dinosaurs?  Did they _really_<br>
exist?  Was it a million years ago?  Were they distroyed in the flood?<br>
Were they a product of the antideluvians fiddling around with genetics?<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks,<br>

<i>&gt; What is "Historic Adventism?" How does this differ from, what I must assume is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the opposite, "Modern Adventism?" </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
 From my understanding, Historic Adventism is the term those people who believe<br>
that the church is giving up some of the fundamental doctrines of our past <br>
call themsleves.  They believe taht the teachers of this "New Theology" are<br>
giving up the doctrines that made this church great.  I believe "New Theology"<br>
is used to describe them not necessarily "Modern Adventism".  <br>
<p>
One thing about Histoiric Adventism though, the name sounds almost stale and<br>
, in other words it sounds as though no new truth is needed or accepted.  This<br>
is from my experience with so-called "Historical Adventists."  I hope we never<br>
get to the position or place wherre we can not or will not consider "new light."<br>
<p>
But once again, this is my perception.  Perhaps others may have better definitions.<br>

All this talk about the nature of Christ, the nature of man, <br>
whether or not we can live perfect lives while waiting for<br>
the return of Christ ... it seems to place argumentation itself<br>
at center stage of the great controversy ... as if our salvation<br>
is somehow dependent on us thrashing out the answers to <br>
questions that have been unanswered for thousands of years.  That<br>
places far too high a value on what we THINK and far too little<br>
emphasis on what Christ had DONE.  He saved us while we are still<br>
ignorant savages.  No degree in theology is required, not that<br>
such degrees offer much practical help to sin damaged souls.  <br>
<p>
The real battle is not between us and Satan.  It isn't between us<br>
and God.  It's between Christ and Satan and the outcome has already<br>
been decided.  Placing our own silly thoughts at center stage of<br>
this controversy is both egotistical and dangerous.  What we thinks<br>
is important, but not as important as Who we love and trust.<br>

What Calvinistic theologies was Larsen debunking?  I've been SDA for only <br>
2 years and sometimes, I don't understand what people are fussing about.<br>

Well, we are differnet, but the fact that we are is, to me, incidental,<br>
and not of any importance in itself.  The important thing is that we are<br>
following the all truth revealed to us by God.  If, because of that, we<br>
are different, than so be it, if we are the same, than so be it too.  We<br>
should not try to conform to be "one of the crowd" just for the sake of<br>
conformity, neither should we try to be different just to be different.<br>
We should just follow where God leads and be whatever He wants us to be,<br>
and not worry too much about it.<br>
<p>

<p>
It is good to at first talk with others about subjects upon which we can<br>
both agree, so that prejudice will be broken down and they will be more<br>
receptive to other things too, and both us and them will be brought closer to<br>
God.<br>

I think you might find this quote interesting:<br>
"The message of truth is new and startling to the people of this country<br>
[Austraila]. The bible doctrines presented are as a new revelation, and they<br>
really look upon the sentiments advanced as infidelity. In presenting the<br>
Sunday question, or the union of church and state, handle it carefully. It<br>
will not answer to present the strong positions that have been and will of<br>
necessity be presented in America." -- Evangelism page 227<br>

In response to Nancy's question, these quotations may be relevant.<br>
<p>
The humanity of the Son of God is everything to us.  It is the<br>
golden chain that binds our souls to Christ, and through Christ<br>
to God.  This is to be our study. ...  We should come to this<br>
study with the humility of a learner, with a contrite heart.<br>
And the study of the incarnation of Christ is a fruitful field<br>
which will repay the searcher who digs deep for hidden truth.<br>
<p>
	1 SM page 244<br>
<p>
Therefore he [Satan] is constantly seeking to deceive the<br>
followers of Christ with his fatal sophistry that it is impossible<br>
for them to overcome.<br>
<p>
	GC page 489<br>
<p>
Satan declared that it was impossible for the sons and<br>
daughters of Adam to keep the law of God. ... Men who are under<br>
the control of Satan repeat these accusations against God, in<br>
asserting that men cannot keep the law of God.<br>
<p>
	Signs of the Times vol. 3 page 264<br>
<p>
Let no one say, I cannot remedy my defects of character.  If you<br>
come to this decision, you will certainly fail of obtaining<br>
eternal life.<br>

Is any one else as happy as I am to get off the health lessons in Sabbath<br>
School?  Somehow protein, fats, etc. is not what I want to discuss on<br>
Sabbath morning!  I love digging into a Bible book though, and Job is<br>
definitely a challenge.<br>
<p>
As for other beings -- what were you guys doing reading those verses<br>
the first week?  They are in week 2's lesson!  I taught last week, so<br>
got to do all the history of the book, which I enjoy a lot.  I'm glad<br>
I'm not responsible for this week, because I've always had trouble<br>
fitting the scenes between Satan and God in heaven essentially using<br>
Job as a pawn in a power struggle in with my conception of a loving<br>
God.  I would feel a lot better if tjosehose portions were allegorical --<br>
any takers?<br>

<i>&gt; Just a query, what is the Baker letter? A brief description of who wrote it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; when, and why, and where one would be likely to find a copy, would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; appreciated!</i><br>
<p>
The Baker letter is officially referred to as "Letter 8, 1895."<br>
It is a letter written by Ellen G. White to Elder W. L. H. Baker, who<br>
at the time was doing field evangelistic work in Tasmania.  Baker<br>
later served as president of several conferences (New South Wales, New<br>
Zealand, Victoria, Tasmania, and West Australia) and was a Bible<br>
teacher at Avondale.<br>
<p>
The Baker letter, also referenced by the EGW Estate as "Manuscript<br>
Release #414," is 19 pages long and is full of the kind of encouragment<br>
and advice needed by a fledgling young gospel worker.<br>
<p>
Then suddenly, on page 5 of MR #414, Mrs. White brings Baker a word of<br>
warning:<br>
<p>
    "Be careful, exceedingly careful as to how you dwell upon the human<br>
nature of Christ.  Do not set Him before the people as a man with the<br>
propensities of sin.  He is the second Adam.  The first Adam was created<br>
a pure, sinless being, without a taint of sin upon him; he was in the image<br>
of God.  He could fall, and he did fall through transgressing.  Because of<br>
sin, his posterity was born with inherent propensities of disobedience.<br>
But Jesus Christ was the only begotten Son of God.  He took upon Himself<br>
human nature, and was tempted in all points as human nature is tempted.  He<br>
could have sinned; He could have fallen, but not for one moment was there in<br>
Him an evil propensity.  He was assailed with temptations in the wilderness,<br>
as Adam was assailed with temptations in Eden.<br>
    "Bro. Baker, avoid every question in relation to the humanity of Christ<br>
which is liable to be misunderstood.  Truth lies close to the track of<br>
presumption.  In treating upon the humanity of Christ, you need to guard<br>
strenously every assertion, lest your words be taken to mean more than they<br>
imply, and thus you lose or dim the clear perceptions of His humanity combined<br>
with divinity.  His birth was a miracle of God; for, said the angel, `Behold<br>
thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name<br>
Jesus.  He shall be great and shall be called the son of the Highest; and<br>
the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his Father David: And he shall<br>
reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no<br>
end.  Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing that I know not<br>
a man?  And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come<br>
upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also<br>
that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.'<br>
    "These words are not addressed to any human being, except to the Son of<br>
the Infinite God.  Never, in any way, leave the slightest impression upon<br>
human minds that a taint of, or inclination to corruption rested upon Christ,<br>
or that He in any way yielded to corruption.  He was tempted in all points like<br>
as man is tempted, yet He is called that holy thing.  It is a mystery that is<br>
left unexplained to mortals that Christ could be tempted in all points like<br>
as we are, and yet be without sin.  The incarnation of Christ has ever been,<br>
and will ever remain a mystery.  That which is revealed is for us and for our<br>
children, but let every human being be warned from the ground of making Christ<br>
altogether human, such an one as ourselves: for it cannot be.  The exact time<br>
when humanity blended with divinity, it is not necessary for us to know.  We are<br>
to keep our feet on the rock, Christ Jesus, as God revealed in humanity.<br>
    "I preceive that there is danger in approaching subjects which dwell on the<br>
humanity of the Son of the infinite God.  He did humble Himself when He saw<br>
He was in fashion as a man, that He might understand the force of all<br>
temptations wherewith man is beset.<br>
    "The first Adam fell: the second Adam held fast to God and His word under<br>
the most trying circumstances, and His faith in His Father's goodness, mercy,<br>
and love did not waver for one moment."<br>
<p>
<p>
NOTE: Parts of the Baker letter appear in the SDA Bible Commentary, EGW<br>
<p>
I obtained a copy of the complete letter (Manuscript Release #414) from the<br>
EGW Estate.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
A couple of years ago or so, I received a letter from a friend who I had met <br>
at Walla Walla College.  He had graduated with his civil engineering degree<br>
and returned to West Africa (Ivory Coast) with the hope of his skills as a<br>
blessing to his fellow Africans.  <br>
<p>
Things did not turn out as he had planned, however.  He found that people <br>
were jealous of his opportunity to study in the States and had little use for<br>
his talents.  He could not find work in his line of expertise.  He told me in <br>
this letter that he considered returning to Africa to be the biggest mistake <br>
of his life.  <br>
<p>
I really felt sorry for him.  I had purchased a calculator for him while he<br>
was still in the States so that he could take it with him when he returned to <br>
Africa.  He was so happy about it.  I can still remember seeing his big<br>
grin when I bumped into him unexpectedly at WWC during a return visit to<br>
campus.<br>
<p>
Sometime later I received another letter from him informing me that he had<br>
contracted tuberculosis and was unable to walk.  He included a picture of<br>
himself in a hospital bed.  I thought, "What a waste!"  The prognosis<br>
looked bleak for him.  The physicians thought he might die from the disease,<br>
or at least be crippled, but his condition began to improve.  I received <br>
more letters from him indicating that God was healing him.<br>
<p>
Yesterday's mail brought another letter, including a photo of him STANDING <br>
beside a wheelchair and a walker.  Praise the Lord!  His faith is strong <br>
also.  He asked me to share his experience with those I know, so I will quote <br>
from his letter.<br>
<p>
QUOTE...(grammatical mistakes uncorrected)<br>
<p>
Doctors and many people thought I would definitely have to die or at the best<br>
have my legs crippled!  I had sores with visible bones all over my body.  But<br>
like a miracle, my health improved and gradually I found my health back.  <br>
This left many people amazed.  The miracles of our Lord were the yesterday, <br>
today and tomorrow.  Please tell my story to your other friend to strengthen<br>
their faith in all situations.  Please read John 11:40.<br>
<p>
END OF QUOTE<br>
<p>
Here is John 11:40 from the NIV (context = raising of Lazarus):<br>
  Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see <br>
  the glory God?"<br>
<p>
Well, this story has strengthened my faith.  I hope it has yours as well.<br>

SDAnet,<br>
<p>
A few months ago our congregation held a Revelation seminar, with our pastor<br>
as the speaker.  The first night's attendance was quite good (approximately<br>
80-100 non-SDAs I would estimate).  On the second night, we had about half<br>
as many non-SDAs and it soon tapered off to a faithful few (about 20).<br>
<p>
It so happens that our pastor had previously produced a series of 24 cassettes <br>
covering basically the same topics as those addressed during a Revelation <br>
seminar.  This has proved to be a successful program.  He has commented that in<br>
the past when he gave a seminar and people would miss a night or drop out due <br>
to time conflicts he simply had to tell them to come back to a future seminar <br>
or direct them to some outside reading.  At this seminar, he was able to give<br>
them the cassette corresponding to the night they missed.  We have also been<br>
able to make use of the many names of those who registered for the series<br>
but who never came or dropped out very early.  Many of the people he has <br>
called after the seminar have desired to receive the cassettes, which are<br>
delivered one-per-week by our members.<br>
<p>
The seminar ended in November and for the approximately $10,000 spent on it<br>
we have, as yet,had only one baptism directly attributable to the lectures.  <br>
However, this cassette program has yielded one baptism and three more have <br>
chosen to be baptised next month.  So the two methods are complementing each <br>
other.  In the past, the names garnered from the expensive mass-mailing of <br>
Revelation seminar handbills would not be used if they didn't show up at the <br>
seminar.  Now we can capitalize on these interests even if they don't come to <br>
the meetings.<br>
<p>
When I first heard our pastor promoting his tape program, I was uncertain<br>
what to think, since there is very little person-to-person contact in it <br>
unless the student indicates a desire for it.  You simply leave the next tape <br>
with them and pick up the previous one each week.  They fill out a very short<br>
quiz on the tape they have listened to and are asked to make incremental<br>
commitments each week.  People seem to prefer this to bringing you into their <br>
home.<br>
<p>
One basic assumption behind it is that people are not reading much these<br>
days, and are therefore less likely to study through a set of written Bible<br>
studies than they are to play a cassette.  Another assumption is that people<br>
are very busy and are not likely to want to set up a regular schedule<br>
for you to visit and study with them.<br>
<p>
This tape program is working for our church, and is being used in about 100<br>
other churches, our pastor says.  If you are interested, let me know, and I <br>
will give him your name.  This is a sales pitch I know; but, hey, why not?<br>

How do you know all those things about Adam &amp; Eve? Where you there? &lt;&lt;Just <br>
kidding!&gt;&gt;I am sticking with the theory and it is just not a theory -- that <br>
Eve wandered away from Adam!<br>

The so-called "Baker letter" is known officially as EGW Letter 8, 1895,<br>
although it was probably written in February 1896. It was addressed to<br>
W.T.H. Baker and his wife, who had just completed a disappointing series <br>
of evangelistic meetings in Tasmania. Most of the letter is available from<br>
the White Estate as Ms. Release #414. <br>
<p>
The letter is lengthy--requiring some 19 pages of double-spaced typescript<br>
(the released portion is 14 pages long). Embedded in the midst of advice<br>
on various subjects related to evangelism are five paragraphs on talking<br>
(publicly) about the nature of Christ. These are published in the SDA Bible<br>
<p>
"Be careful, exceedingly careful as to how you dwell upon the human nature<br>
of Christ. Do not set Him before the people as a man with the propensities<br>
of sin. He is the second Adam. The first Adam was created a pure, sinless<br>
being, without a taint of sin upon him; he was in the image of God. He<br>
could fall, and he did fall through transgressing. Because of sin, his<br>
posterity was born with inherent propensities of disobedience. But Jesus<br>
Christ was the only begotten Son of God. He took upon Himself human<br>
nature, and was tempted in all points as human nature is tempted. He could<br>
have sinned; He could have fallen, but not for one moment was there in Him<br>
an evil propensity. He was assailed with temptations in the wilderness, as<br>
Adam was assailed with temptations in Eden."<br>

We recently received in the mail a set of 6 tapes from Mark Martin, of<br>
Calvary Community Church in Phoenix, Arizona.  We had not requested the<br>
tapes, so I don't know if he bought an mailing list or someone else had<br>
them sent to us.  We listened to three and are throwing the rest away.<br>
Apparently he is a PUC graduate and former assistant pastor of the Glendale<br>
AZ church, who became disaffected with Adventism over 1844 and the sanctuary,<br>
and now is not keeping Sabbath anymore either because he sees it as the<br>
sign and seal of the Old Testament covenant.  Because we are now under<br>
grace rather than the law, he sees no need to keep the old Sabbath.  We<br>
found him to be a bit insulting about the denomination, saying that SDAs<br>
cultic and that you couldn't be a true Christian and remain in the church.<br>
He also made statements such as non-vegetarians could not be elders or<br>
deacons in the church, which might be true for some very conservative<br>
local congregations, but is definitely not true for the church at large.<br>
Two of the tapes we heard were radio interviews, while one seemed to be<br>
part of a sermon.<br>
<p>
Anyone know more about this guy?  How did he get our address?  It came<br>
to our old address, from which we moved last summer, so whatever list<br>
he's got, it isn't up to date.<br>

Tony said:<br>
<i>&gt;This could probably be termed "original sin" if it wasn't for the fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;others have created a meaning for the term that goes beyond the two words in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the phrase.</i><br>
<p>
I came across a very strange meaning for this phrase a few months ago. I was<br>
brousing through the religion conference in the bulletin board in my<br>
university, and they were all talking about whether babies are born<br>
condemned sinners, and the non-christians found this idea ridiculous and<br>
distasteful and said so (you can't teach a baby anything, so how's it<br>
supposed to know how to do anything wrong). Anyway, it seems that the people<br>
in there had the idea that the original sin committed by Adam and Eve was<br>
that they had sexual relations, and so all children born as a result of<br>
sexual reproduction are tainted by sin, except Jesus, who was born to a<br>
virgin. I wonder where they got this ridiculous idea from. Anyway, i showed<br>
them where God Himself told Adam and Eve to multiply, and so that couldn't<br>
be a sin.<br>

[It's a Catholic idea dating from Augustine in the 4th century AD  SCT]<br>

Over the past two weekends I have, along with my primary-aged<br>
puppeteers, been helping with the children's program at the Questions<br>
Before Midnight<br>
meetings currently going at the SDA church in Hinsdale, IL.  There are few<br>
thrills more satisfying than seeing the eager eyes of those young children<br>
who have always been interested in the things of God, and each time they hear<br>
the story they listen with an enthusiasm as if they are hearing it for<br>
the first time.  For the few that are hearing it the first time, it is<br>
even better.<br>
<p>
But I have also seen a troublesome trend in our group this time that<br>
I've not seen before.  Even in children of eight and nine years old, I<br>
see in some of them a hardness--they are not willing to hear or listen. <br>
I can only guess that they are so TV-saturated that even with a fast<br>
paced program of Christian magic, puppets, games, songs in addition to<br>
solid Biblical teaching, they do not have the attention span or the<br>
discernment to respond.<br>
Is this too black of a thought to even be speakable on Easter?  Are our<br>
kids so conditioned to entertainment that the content of that<br>
entertainment does not affect them anymore?  We face the dual dilemma: <br>
1)  The only reality these kids know is the television set.  2)  If we<br>
communicate Jesus to them <br>
within this reality, we run the risk of reducing Jesus to a movie star.<br>
<p>
I suppose the best I can hope for this group is to teach them that Easter is <br>
not a day where we honor the unselfish bunny who rises from his burrow and <br>
gives us all eggs and candy. (And if he sees his shadow, we have six<br>
more weeks of winter, isn't that right?  It's been a while since I heard<br>
this legend).  <br>
<p>
Happy Easter, everybody.  I've got to go eat some chocolate so I can keep <br>
up with this crowd tonight.<br>

Some of you may know that about once a month I play organ for our local<br>
church services.  Recently our church was "blessed" by the arrival of a<br>
rich semi-retired doctor and his wife.  Shortly after they drove their<br>
Lexus into <br>
the parking lot, he took over the duties of director of music.  He is a<br>
fairly accomplished pianist and vocalist.  She is a well-trained<br>
vocalist.<br>
He claims to be an organist as well but has proved otherwise on several<br>
occasions.  It's all I can do to keep from grinding my teeth while he<br>
plays.<br>
<p>
The good doctor has decided that our church needs a new organ (which we do,<br>
the old one is gradually breaking down stop by stop.)  He has a strong ally<br>
in the person who has been head organist for the last several years.  A<br>
Wurlitzer electronic organ was duly rented for our 25th anniversary. <br>
The salesman offered to leave the organ at our church for a couple extra<br>
weeks, hoping we would decide to buy this organ which "lists for $26000<br>
but can be ours for a limited time at the price of $19995."<br>
<p>
Now, I think the church board of our church is skeptical and conservative <br>
enough that this probably won't pass.  (There's at least one of our board<br>
members on the net.)  But even a few weeks ago when it looked like they<br>
might be able to steamroll it through, I was pretty much quiet, partly<br>
because I didn't wish to get shut out of playing the organ, and partly<br>
because I want a <br>
new organ just as much as anyone else, and  although I know there are much <br>
better organs than this one, we probably couldn't afford them.  Is being<br>
quiet in this situation a sign of hypocrisy?<br>

Ralph Larson argues that the Baker letter was a refutation of<br>
adoptionism.  This is the belief that Christ was born just as we are,<br>
that is, a human but not divine.  Then at some stage He was adopted<br>
because of his efforts to achieve holiness, and became divine as well<br>
as human.  Ellen White wanted to make it clear that Christ had a<br>
divine as well as a human nature, and thus was not one altogether as<br>
ourselves.  And certainly the thought of One who is absolutely pure is<br>
an awesome thought.<br>
<p>
Yet there are also a great many other statements of Ellen White (and<br>
the Bible) that assert that Christ had a humanity like ours.  For<br>
example,<br>
<p>
``He took upon Him our sinful nature.''  RH 12/15/96<br>
<p>
``He took upon Himself fallen suffering human nature, degraded and<br>
defiled by sin.''  Youth Instructor 12/20/1900<br>
<p>
``Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his<br>
brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in<br>
things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the<br>
people.  For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is<br>
able to succor them that are tempted.''  Hebrews 2:17,18<br>
<p>
And 1 John 4:1 - 3 emphasizes the importance of the humanity of Christ<br>
as a test between true and false spirits.  I would also mention that<br>
Roman Catholicism teaches that Christ had a superior humanity, as did<br>
His mother Mary.<br>
<p>
The doctrine that Christ had a superior human nature is considered to<br>
be part of the New Theology, with the claimed consequence that we<br>
cannot have victory over sin.  This is one doctrine that the<br>
denominational book ``Issues'' calls a ``moot theological issue.''<br>
But I can testify that it was not moot for me and some of my friends;<br>
the knowledge that Christ had a humanity like mine was a great<br>
liberator and opened the possibility of a new level of obedience to<br>
us.<br>
<p>
However I would like to caution that the theoretical knowledge is less<br>
important than the practical experience in one's life.  We are not<br>
saved by knowing the truth about the humanity of Christ, though I<br>
believe this truth is important to know.<br>

Yes, it is tremendously important to recognize that Christ was fully human.<br>
I know of no Adventist that would deny that.  My question is whether one<br>
can determine from the evidence what KIND of human nature he had and whether<br>
this determination is vital to salvation or the mission of the church.<br>

Steve,<br>
	If your board is wise, it will explore more than one option. At<br>
your suggestion the members can visit churches (preferrably, but showrooms<br>
as well) to view and listen to Allen and Rogers electronic organs. Also, in<br>
the classifieds of _The American Organist_ (American Guild of Organists'<br>
official publication at your library), churches who are upgrading to larger<br>
electronic organs and pipe organs advertise their instruments.<br>
	Wurlitzers have a reputation for being an entertainment/show<br>
organ and are not known for church repertoire. Allen and Rogers organs (and<br>
perhaps other less well-known ones, but be careful) can be purchased which<br>
offer an electronic likeness to the sounds of a pipe organ at a more affordable<br>
price. There are models available for most church budgets. Perhaps you could<br>
call the representatives for Rogers and Allen and get prices and literature<br>
to bring to the board meeting. The choice of an organ to support the best<br>
worship music is an important one. Don't be silent.<br>

Thus we are faced with a dilemna.  Given that:<br>
<p>
* It is impossible for post-Fall man, on his own, to keep God's law perfectly.<br>
<p>
* If we break the least of the commandments, we are guilty of breaking<br>
them all.<br>
<p>
* God seems to expect perfect commandment-keeping of his people, as<br>
pointed out in the EGW statements quoted by David Plaisted.<br>
<p>
So my question is: How can we obtain the perfect commandment-keeping that<br>
qualifies us for heaven?<br>
<p>
The answer, in my humble opinion, is that we obtain as a grace gift from<br>
God the perfect commandment-keeping of Christ Himself.  By His grace we<br>
are saved, through faith, and that NOT OF OURSELVES.  <br>
<p>
Christ's perfect righteousness then clothes our unrighteousness and we are<br>
accounted as if we had never sinned.  Does that transaction then make void<br>
our need of keeping God's law any further?  No, for we walk by faith not<br>
by the flesh, and we will seek to do God's will to the best of this<br>
sinful-natured shell in which we are trapped until the Second Coming.  Notice:<br>
<p>
"Nothing but the righteousness of Christ can entitle us to one of the<br>
blessings of the covenant of grace.  There are many who have long desired<br>
and tried to obtain these blessings, but have not received them, because<br>
they have cherished the idea that they could do something to make<br>
themselves worthy of them.  They have not looked away from self,<br>
believing that Jesus is an all-sufficient Saviour.....  Let none look to<br>
self, as though they had the power to save themselves.  Jesus died for us<br>
because were were helpless to do this.  In Him is our hope, our<br>
justification, our righteousness."  (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 431).<br>
<p>
"The law demands righteousness, and this the sinner owes to the law; but<br>
he is incapable of rendering it.  The only way in which he can attain to<br>
righteousness is through faith.  By faith he can bring to God the merits<br>
of Christ, and the Lord places the obedience of His Son to the sinner's<br>
account.... and the pardoned soul goes on from grace to grace, from light<br>
to greater light."  (Selected Messages, Vol. 1, p. 367).<br>
<p>
"...Jesus Our Advocate presents an effectual plea in behalf of all who by<br>
repentance and faith have committed the keeping of their souls to Him.  He<br>
pleads their cause and vanquishes their accuser by the mighty arguments of<br>
Calvary.  His perfect obedience to God's law, even unto the death of the<br>
cross, has given Him all power in heaven and in earth, and He claims of His<br>
Father mercy and reconciliation for guilty man."  (Testimonies, v. 5, p. 491).<br>
<p>
"We cannot say, I am sinless, till this vile body is changed and fashioned<br>
like unto His glorious body."  (Special Testimony, 3/23/1888).<br>

<i>&gt;What do all of you believe happened to the dinosaurs?  Did they _really_</i><br>
<i>&gt;exist?  Was it a million years ago?  Were they distroyed in the flood?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Were they a product of the antideluvians fiddling around with genetics?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, they really did exist, there is ample fossil evidence of that. Was it a<br>
million years ago? Well, most scientists think it was more like hundreds of<br>
millions of years ago, while most SDAs think it more like a few thousand<br>
years ago. Were they distroyed by the flood? Well, thats one way to explain<br>
their disappearence. Were they "amalgamations" resulting from antedeluvian<br>
(sounds like "pre-cambrian" or some other geologic word some people like to<br>
use) experiments in genetics? Well, who knows? For all we know of them, the<br>
antedeluvians might even have gone to the moon.<br>
	As far as i know, the bible doesn't specifically mention these<br>
animals, which makes one wonder why, since they must have been pretty hard<br>
not to notice, being so huge and all, but then, Mrs White suggests that<br>
humans were much bigger then too. Still, the bible doesn't say much about<br>
the wildlife before the flood, except when they went into the ark or got<br>
sacrificed.<br>

Dave's EM reminds me that I came to the SDA church because of the<br>
cognitive, but have remained because of the affective.  That is, I<br>
once thought that doctrine was central until I recognized that Christ<br>
[as portrayed in the gospels] had very little to say about dorctrine,<br>
but a lot to say about relationships.  Our denomination puts such<br>
emphasis on "getting it right" [doctrine] that it appears we believe<br>
salavation is "won" by doing well on a qualifying examination the<br>
substance of which is doctrine.  This is, of course, nonsense in<br>
a number of ways. For example, as Dave points out, the chances of our<br>
"getting it right" are remote.  Secondly, salavation is Gods' [yes,<br>
I really meant plural possessive although the singular possessive<br>
will work as well] gift to his beloved humans -- to us.  As a matter<br>
of "law" a gift only requires two things 1)the offer, and 2)the acceptance<br>
of the offer.<br>
<p>
Our preoccupation on occasion with whether something happened in the<br>
heavenly sanctuary in 1844 [I don't want to tackle all the assumptions<br>
that question makes] or what of the ceremonial law survives in the<br>
New Testament is about who we are, not about who God is.  That self-<br>
centeredness is probably dnagerous to our spiritual health.<br>
<p>
Sorry -- this is longer than I intended, and I've "only just begun."<br>

Hello,<br>
<p>
Since mail from LLU is running about 2 weeks late this may arrive long after<br>
interest in this topic has died but I thought I might add just a bit:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What do all of you believe happened to the dinosaurs?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Were they destroyed in the flood?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure we can determine exactly what did happen to the dinos.  Certainly<br>
Noah's flood is one of the best explanations proposed for their extinction.<br>
One of the big problems with the asteroid impact is explaining the selectivity<br>
of the survivors.  The big question for me is Did some of them survive the<br>
flood?  It has been estimated that about 1/2 of the dinos were the size of a<br>
turkey or German shepherd.  So I think it is probable that some of the dinos<br>
were included on the ark.   Some ask how the big ones could have been included<br>
on the ark; I don't think the text excludes juveniles or eggs.  Certainly the<br>
three layers of Cretaceous dino nests in Montana (and nests elsewhere) suggest<br>
that either things were getting pretty frantic during the flood or that these<br>
are post-flood nesting sites.  If they are post-flood, then the ultimate ex-<br>
tinction of the dinos was probably due to their inability to survive in the<br>
post-flood world as is true of many other organisms.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Did they really exist?</i><br>
<p>
There is a lot of excellent evidence that they did indeed exist.  Many complete<br>
skeletons exist, not just adults but juveniles as well.  Skin impressions have<br>
been found and recently, preserved skin! nests, eggs that have been x-rayed and<br>
contain embryos, hatchlings, dung, trackways, all indicate the dinos were real<br>
and very much alive.  I'm not sure where SDAs get the idea that the dinos never<br>
lived and the bones were made by Satan to confuse us.<br>
<p>

addition, there are a number of good books out that are available through the<br>
public libraries.  Get the most recent books, some of Jack Horner's stuff has<br>
been recently revised.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Was it a million years ago?</i><br>
<p>
If you accept the geologic time scale, dinos lived between 250 m.y. and 65 m.y.<br>
b.p.  If you accept the biblical chronology, dinos were pre-flood and possibly<br>
post-flood.  If you accept the dragon legends as reliable accounts of dino<br>
sightings, then dinos were alive in more recent times and their demise is due<br>
to human intervention.  I am comfortable with the biblical chronology.  The<br>
geologic explanations have a number of problems:  the remains are all water<br>
laid and in some cases have marine shark remains associated with them  (this is<br>
a strange mixture of environments), there is no evidence for a break in the<br>
food chain but on the other hand, the deposits of some  dinos seem to   lack<br>
adequate vegetation for the herbivorous dino herds, the asteroid impact and sub<br>
sequent "nulear winter" scenario invoked to explain the dino destruction cannot<br>
explain the survival of reptiles of similar size and habitat, the sudden extinc<br>
tion appears to some to have been very gradual over the approximately 200 m.y.<br>
period that dinos supposedly existed i.e., Triassic dino populations are<br>
different from Jurassic dino pop. and both are different from Cretaceous dino<br>
pop., there are big arguments with regard to the survival of dinos past the K/T<br>
(Cretaceous/Tertiary) boundary (so far all of the post K/T deposits I have seen<br>
are reworked sediments and cannot be used to prove post K/T survival).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Were they a product of the antediluvians fiddling around with genetics?</i><br>
<p>
I'm going to jump to a big conclusion here and assume this question is prompted<br>
by EGWs statements with regard to God's destruction of amalgamated species. (At<br>
least that is the context in which I always hear this question.)  When she<br>
writes about the analgamated species she says they caused confusion.  As far as<br>
I can tell there is no confusion with respect to the dinos; they are reptiles.<br>
There are other fossils that in my mind fit her description much better such as<br>
mammal-like reptiles.  By the way, her comments on the large beasts should not<br>
be applied exclusively to dinos either; almost all of the large mammals are<br>
gone as well as many gigantic marine organisms.  So to answer the question, no<br>
I don't think the antediluvians had much to do with the dinos.<br>
<p>
To shift the topic just a tad, I was told recently (last Sabbath) that our<br>
scientists are to the point or almost to the point where they can write genes.<br>
Is this true?  Apparently, once a new gene is written and introduced there is<br>
no way to remove it from the population (you can make it recessive but you can<br>
not eliminate it).  Are we going to have gene hackers like the computer people<br>
that introduce computer viruses?  It is also my understanding that new genes<br>
are required for evolution to occur and that is why geneticists are not too<br>
keen on evolution or argue that there has not been enough time for evolution to<br>
occur if mutation is the only source for new genes.  Any insight on this?  Oops<br>
this is not intended as an evolution question per se but rather as a genetics<br>
issue. (I'm just curious, Steve, and if you want to edit that last part it's OK<br>
by me.)<br>
<p>
I have a few things on dinos lying around my office.  If some of you would like<br>
some of the material, send me your snail mail address and I'll be glad to send<br>
it out.  My e-mail address:  GRIMKE@LLUVM.BITNET.<br>

,I think one of the most effective ways to serve God and to show He<br>

That's GC as in Great Controversy, not General Conference!  I got some<br>
replies personally to my queries about Job, the gist of which is<br>
summarized by saying Job (as we all are) was caught up in the Great<br>
Controversy between Christ and Satan.  I have no problem with the idea<br>
that Satan plays dirty tricks on humans in his role of troubler of Zion,<br>
I even can take the idea that God allows this to go on in a broad, general<br>
sense.  It is the specificity with which it occurs in the story of Job<br>
that is so difficult for me.<br>
<p>
To bring it to modern times, I was reading Newsweek about the Bosnians<br>
who were fleeing in trucks from one awful place to a slightly less<br>
awful place.  One grandmother had gotten separated from all her family<br>
except a teenage granddaughter, but that granddaughter was killed in the<br>
crush on the trucks.  At the destination, the grandmother was curled<br>
up on a mat, not taking food, but simply crying over and over, "I have<br>
no one."  If I believed that God and Satan had discussed in detail just<br>
what was going to happen to this woman and God had said, "OK, go ahead<br>
and take away all her family, kill her granddaughter, let her starve<br>
to death," then my conception of God would be completely different than<br>
it is now.  Do you see my point at all?  I can take the global awfulness<br>
that is a result of sin and Satan's actions, and I can accept that God<br>
allows the consequences of sin to play out; but I have major trouble<br>
with the idea that God somehow initials Satan's plans on a case by case<br>
basis.<br>

A fairly recent Review had an article by Roger Coon.  In it he makes<br>
passing reference to an Adventist-turned-Mormon with whom many SDAnetters<br>
are acquainted.  The footnote ref'd a private communication with Nancy V<br>
from "Sherrie Benson" (a pseudonym).  Since "Sherrie" is no longer a<br>
subscriber, I believe, I trust it appropriate to recommend we remember<br>
her in prayer.<br>

Well, it's clear what we shall have to do on the first evening of the <br>
SDAnet symposium, whenever it happens (not before my dissertation is written).<br>
<p>
We will organize a viewing of the movie "The Last Temptation of Christ"<br>
This should make the case well for one point or the other as has been <br>
discussed here.  (I have never seen this movie so I don't know beforehand <br>
which.)  Then we can spend an evening in live and animated discussion.<br>
<p>
All seriousness aside, I think all that we can conclude from the various<br>
quotes in the Baker Letter and elsewhere is that "nature" and "propensities"<br>
mean something different, because one was sinful and the other is not.<br>
We would all do well to continue to study the life of Christ.  That which<br>
Ellen White referred to as a mystery is something where speculation may <br>
prove either misleading or fruitless.  My posts have included as much<br>
speculation  as any others in this series.<br>
<p>
Dr. Larson's main lesson that he draws from the nature of Christ seems <br>
to be that it is possible for us to overcome sin through the same power<br>
of God that Christ accessed.  There are some SDA's who would dispute that,<br>
including possibly the late authors of Questions on Doctrine.  But as<br>
far as I read the Fundamental Beliefs, this doctrine is on quite firm<br>
standing<br>
and included as part of the twenty-seven.  If there is any dispute,<br>
it's just whether or not every text and every EGW quote that Dr. Larson <br>
claims points to this doctrine, and his conception of how Christ had to<br>
be to make this doctrine true, have anything to do with the actual truth<br>
of the situation. <br>
<p>
The question of "Historical Adventism" should have little to do with it.<br>
Fortunately Ellen White did not worry about "historical Methodism", nor<br>
did Martin Luther worry about "historical Catholicism."  Present truth<br>
must stand in the present, not on the foundation of historical precedent.<br>

To Lola:<br>
<p>
Yes Lola, I was glad for one to get off the health lessons. Although I was <br>
hoping to read the book "The Seventh-day Diet" by Chris Rucker and Jan <br>
Hoffman during last quarter. Guess I will have to make it this quarter!!<br>
<p>
Yes, I am enjoying Job. There are some unanswered questions about Job and <br>
his situation aren't there??? I do not subscribe to the idea that Job's <br>
suffering was God's will!<br>
<p>
Have a good week!<br>

Steve, on your quote of COL 331 I would have felt better if you had <br>
included a sentence in that same paragraph:  "The real difficulty arises <br>
from the corruption of an unsanctified heart,  AND AN UNWILLINGNESS TO <br>
SUBMIT TO THE CONTROL OF GOD." At least in one sense I believe reflecting <br>
God's character is impossible without the control of God in our lives. I am <br>
sure you agree! Correct?<br>
<p>
On the nature of Christ, I have some strong convictions. I think that we <br>
could probably support both views -- sinless verses sinful nature from the <br>
SOP. Martin Weber made the remark a few weeks ago in our Sabbath School <br>
class at Grasonville that Christ did have an advantage that we do not have! <br>
He could have called down the powers of heaven! In case someone retorts <br>
with Desire Of Ages, I will say now that I know DA mentions that Christ had <br>
no power that we cannot have. However, I have not been able to call fire <br>
down from heaven lately! &lt;&lt;smile!!&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Further, I would say, that we spend entirely too much time trying to figure <br>
out Christ's nature when we could be giving the gospel to someone that <br>
doesn't know about it.<br>
<p>
In retrospect, I am not trying to solicit messages from the net but I do <br>
believe that Christ had a sinless nature. Also I think a lot of us over <br>
react on this question. I think it is good to let "dead dogs lie." It is <br>
not going to affect my relationship with Christ -- with me it is not a <br>
matter that I must know one way or the other in regard to Christ's nature.<br>
<p>
Just voicing a personal opinion!<br>
<p>
.......Paul<br>

Lola says that she has trouble believing that God initials Satan's plans<br>
on a case by case basis.  Well first of all, we should point out that<br>
this was the only place Satan was nice enough to ask God about it. <br>
Nevertheless,<br>
the idea follows quite naturally:<br>
<p>
1)  God is omnipotent<br>
2)  God knows all Satan's plans before they are ever carried out.<br>
3)  Therefore God could intervene and keep any evil from happening<br>
     to anyone.<br>
4)  He chooses not to in many cases.<br>
<p>
This follows along with Jesus' words to Pilate "thou couldst have no <br>
power against me except it were given thee from above."<br>
<p>
To me the idea that "God doesn't cause such-and-such, He just allows it <br>
to happen" is a swindle.  It points to a helpless God.  The truth is that <br>
God is sovereign and is responsible for everything that happens on this <br>
earth.  The sacred writings between Genesis 3 and 1 Chronicles dispense<br>
with the devil as a cause for suffering altogether, because God was intent<br>
on revealing Himself as the only Sovereign being, not wanting to make an <br>
identifiable evil figure such as existed in the pantheon of most other<br>
religions at the time.<br>
<p>
If we recognize that God is the key figure in the suffering that happens<br>
to us, and the first one to help us repair whatever damage was done, we<br>
can <br>
have a greater picture of His power.<br>
<p>
(Sorry, longtime SDAnet readers, for repeating myself on this one.  SCT)<br>

[From Ademir Soares  SCT]<br>
To all of us to consider...<br>
<p>
A REFORM NEEDED...<br>
<p>
If (We) Seventh-day Adventists practiced what we profess to believe, if we were<br>
sincere healt reformers, we would indeed be a spectacle to the world, to angels<br>
and to men. And we would show a far greater zeal for the salvation of those who<br>
are ignorant of the truth.<br>
Greater reforms should be seen among the people who claim to be looking for the<br>
soon appearing of Christ. Health reform is to do among our people a work which<br>
it has not yet done. There are those who ought to be awake to the danger of<br>
meat eating, who are still eating the flesh of animals, thus endangering the<br>
physical, mental, and spiritual health. Many who are now only half converted<br>
on the question of meat eating will go from God's people, to walk no more with<br>
them.<br>
In all our work we must obey the laws which GOD has given, that the physical<br>
and the spiritual energies may work in harmony.Men may have a form of godliness<br>
they may even preach the gospel, and yet be unpurified and unsanctified. Minis<br>
ters should be strictly temperate in their  eating and drinking, lest they make<br>
crooked paths for their feet, turning the lame - those weak in the faith- out<br>
of the way. If while proclaiming the most solemn and important message GOD has<br>
ever given, men war against the truth by indulging wrong habits of eating and<br>
drinking, they take all the force from the message they bear.<br>
Those who indulge in meat eating, tea drinking, and gluttony are sowing seeds<br>
for a harvest of pain and death. The unhealthful food placed in the stomach<br>
strengthens the appetites that war against the soul, developin the lower pro<br>
pensities. A diet of flesh meat tends to develop animamlism. A development of<br>
animalism lessens spirituality, rendering the mind incapable of understanding<br>
truth.<br>
The Word of GOD plainly warns us that unless we abstain from fleshly lusts,<br>
the physical nature will be brought into conflict with the spiritual nature.<br>
Lustful eating wars against health and peace. Thus a warfare is instituted<br>
between the higher and the lower propensities, strong and active, oppress the<br>
soul. The highest interests of the being are imperiled by the indulgence of<br>
appetites unsanctioned by Heaven.<br>
Great care should be taken to from right habits of eating and drinking. The<br>
food eaten should be that which will make the best blood. The delicate organs<br>
of digestions should be respected. GOD requires us, by being temperate in all<br>
things, to act our part toward keeping ourselves in health. He cannot enligten<br>
the mind of a man who makes a cesspool of his stomach. He does not hear the<br>
prayers of those who are walking in the light of the sparks of their own<br>
kindling.<br>
Eating has much to do with religion. The spiritual experience is greatly<br>
affected by the way in which the stomach is treated. Eating and drinking in<br>
accordance with the laws of health promote virtuous actions. What a pity it is<br>
that often, when the greatest self-denial should be exercised, the stomach is<br>
crowded with a mass of unhealtful food, which lies there to decompose. The<br>
affliction of the stomach afflicts the brain. The imprudent eater does NOT<br>
realize that he is disqualifying himself for giving wise counsel, disquali<br>
fying himself for laying plans for the best advancement fo the work of GOD.<br>
He CANNOT discern spiritual things, and in council meeting, when he should<br>
say Yea, he says Nay. He makes propositions that are wide of the mark, becau<br>
se the food he has eaten has benumbled his brain power.<br>
<p>
The Failure to follow sound principles has marred the history of GOD's people.<br>
There has been a continual backsliding in health reform,and as a result GOD is<br>
dishonored by a great lack of spirituality. Barriers have been erected which<br>
would never have been seen had GOD's people walked in the light.<br>
<p>
   Shall we who have had such great opportunities allow the people of the world<br>
to go in advance of us in health reform?<br>
   Shall we cheapen our minds and abuse our talents by wrong eating?<br>
   Shall we transgress GOD's holy law by following selfish practices?<br>
   Shall our inconsistency become a byword?<br>
   Shall we live such unchristianklike lives that the Savior will be ashamed<br>
to call us brethren?<br>
<p>
These word were said almost 100 years ago... and how true it is still now!<br>
<p>
How's that...<br>

It is amazing that when you go to the person involved, he seems<br>
to have a different view of the situation.<br>

Elaine, thanks for the helpful discussion on dinosaurs.  You may not know<br>
it but here in La Sierra we now have a pair of Tuataras on display in the<br>
World Museum of Natural History.  Many people consider them to be living<br>
dinosaurs. . . they are found continuously in the fossil record back to<br>
the dinosaurs.  From what I have learned about them, skeletally they are<br>
very interesting.<br>
<p>
While you are at it, you might explain findings such as the La Brea Tar<br>
Pits.  It always troubles me that a number of species, especially large<br>
species, survived the flood (in the Ark?) only to become extinct rather<br>
soon after the flood.  It seems like this problem could have been forseen<br>
and would have saved Noah building such a large craft to save them from the<br>
flood.<br>
<p>
Bill<br>

David,<br>
If you qualify your emphasis that Christ was born on earth in the same<br>
"sinful, degraded" human nature that we have with a statement that in His<br>
humanity He was "yet without sin,"  then I agree with you fully.  Though<br>
He was tempted in every point, yet He was without sin, else He would not<br>
have been the Sinless One, the spotless Lamb.<br>
<p>
Whatever the circumstances behind the writing of the Baker later, the<br>
admonition contained therein seems genuine and applicable in addressing any<br>
attempt to make Christ appear to be completely like one of us in every<br>
respect.  Christ was a Special Creation, "that holy thing."  In my<br>
opinion, His spiritual condition could be likened to that of Adam before<br>
the Fall, and I have several EGW statements to that effect.  The<br>
difference being that his physical nature and attributes were post-Fall.<br>

Has anyone heard of "humanistic Judaism"? Raylene and I were watching a TV<br>
program (classified as a movie btw) entitled "Ancient Secrets of the Bible",<br>
and one of the guys interviewed was Rabbi someone-or-other, founder of <br>
humanistic Judaism. That was a new one on us, and we were wondering what it<br>
is all about.<br>
<p>
Bill Shea was also interviewed on the program, although none of the experts<br>
were labelled with their denominational affiliation (except the rabbi).<br>

 From a message about Adam &amp; sin:<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
Adam was with Eve throughout the entire episode.  Yet he allowed Eve to<br>
be the spokesperson about the things of God, abdicating his role as<br>
spiritual head over the family.  He allowed Eve to eat the fruit, while<br>
he stood right by her.  Then he ate some of the fruit himnself.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
Where does the idea come from that Adam was the spiritual head over the<br>
family even before sin? I would have thought that Eve's "connection" with<br>
God was equal to Adam's, and that the concept of a "spiritual head" is<br>
only needed under the rule of sin.<br>

Sherman's description of "historic Adventism" is pretty much what I<br>
understand the term to mean.<br>
<p>
It is a more precise term than "conservative". All "historic Adventists"<br>
are conservative, but not all who are conservative are historic Adventists.<br>
A conservative person places importance on holding on to values and ideals<br>
which have been passed down by previous generations, but is not opposed to<br>
thinking about new ideas, and will adopt those new ideas should they prove<br>
worthwhile. This could not be said for most who claim the label "historic<br>
Adventist".<br>
<p>
As for "modern Adventism", yes, the historic Adventists differentiate between<br>
themselves and others by labelling the other beliefs as "New Theology". They<br>
coined this phrase themselves, so the best description of what it entails is<br>
probably Larson's description, given here on the net a few days ago. Whether<br>
or not Larson is correctly portraying the beliefs of modern Adventism is<br>
debatable. (As evidenced by the subsequent posts, Re: The real issue, which<br>
followed up the original one.)<br>

I don't disagree that Eve had a good "connection" with God just as Adam did.  But I<br>
think there can be only one head of a household and since Adam was given dominion<br>
over the animals he was thereby placed in a position of leadership.  To me, as I look<br>
at the way children look up to there dad's as representative of God (in their eyes),<br>
it only makes sense that the father be the spiritual leader of the household.  This<br>
is not to belittle the very important spiritual role that the mother plays in the<br>
home, but ideally, the father should be initiating the spiritual leading in the home.<br>
<p>
Just as you run into trouble in a house where you have two heads of the house in<br>
other areas, I believe that you will have trouble if you have two spiritual leaders,<br>
particularly if the two spouses don't see eye to eye on things.<br>

Ruben Gonzalez said:<br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me that all of the prophets and especially Jerimiah would have</i><br>
<i>&gt;been prime candidates for CB-manship. </i><br>
<p>
I thought this comparison of present day unacceptance of those who criticise<br>
and the prophets of old very clever, and it is this same question that often<br>
gets me really confused over who is really right and who isn't. <br>
<p>
I have also recently been reading about Jeremiah and other prophets in the <br>
surrounding periods of the history of Israel and Judah. It is a fascinating <br>
story and you bring up a good point that the prophets did not mince words when <br>
it came to criticizing the erring Kings (and priests etc) of God's people. <br>
<p>
But at the same time three points come to mind:<br>
<p>
1. Jeremiah was a *prophet*. <br>
<p>
Jeremiah was chosen by God to be a prophet. That meant that in a time when<br>
the people were ignoring God, and God was planning their punishment for<br>
breaking their covenant, Jeremiah was one of the people chosen to record the<br>
messages of God so that a record of God's attempts to rescue his people would<br>
exist. Jeremiah had an exceedingly tough task.<br>
<p>
I think that many of us would also agree, despite the fact that EGW never<br>
claimed the title for herself, that she was a prophet or messenger from God<br>
for a more recent time. Part of her job was to encourage the Church, as part<br>
of Jeremiah's job was, but it also had to involve reproof - or criticism <br>
(which is painful to receive).<br>
<p>
The question I ask is are-there/will-there-be any more prophets? Are these<br>
people (some of these people) who criticise the church prophets? If they are<br>
then we should accept their criticism. If they aren't then maybe a comparison<br>
of their criticism with the criticism of Jeremiah or Elijah isn't such a good<br>
one.<br>
<p>
2. The sins of the people.<br>
<p>
Israel before its fall, then Judah in the times of Jeremiah really were <br>
involved in some horrible sins. The worship of pagan deities involved<br>
fertility rites which included homosexual and heterosexual activities. Child<br>
sacrifice was also practiced. These things really are uncivilized stuff, and<br>
very disturbing considering the value God has always placed on marriage and<br>
on human life. Our secular society would really be up in arms about such<br>
activities today. So why should we be surprised that God's prophets spoke<br>
so strongly about the harlotry of Israel and Judah?<br>
<p>
3. The attitudes of the prophets.<br>
<p>
The thing I like the most about these prophets is that while their messages<br>
were stern, and often condemnatory, they didn't enjoy giving them. God always<br>
chose people as his messengers who had a great burden for those to whom the<br>
message must go. It caused them great pain to give God's messages, and they<br>
frequently wept or became ill as a result. It seems that God told Jeremiah<br>
to stop praying for Judah because it was no use but Jeremiah couldn't help<br>
himself and prayed for Judah anyway, and Moses likewise often plead for God's<br>
people.<br>
<p>
I don't know about the private prayer lives of those who criticise the Church<br>
today, but if their criticism comes just from the bitterness of human nature<br>
rather than through the pain of having to deliver a message from God to people<br>
they love then ... <br>
<p>
Just a few thoughts hey. What do you guys think?<br>

In response to Noe Torres, I believe that without Christ's atonement<br>
we would be cut off from God and not have access to power for<br>
victory over sin.  But Christ, coming to this world, still had<br>
a connection with God by virtue of His own Deity.  Now that<br>
Christ has offered Himself for us, we have access to the same<br>
power in Him that He had in God.  Before Christ died, there was<br>
still power for victory available, but it was apparently more<br>
limited, depending on a future atonement.  Since Pentecost the<br>
Holy Spirit has been poured out in fuller measure.<br>

David,<br>
I am continuing this thread not for the sake of argumentation, but rather<br>
in the spirit of legitimate inquiry:<br>

<p>
Good, but here's my point: Isn't "victory over sin" assured by the Cross? <br>
Doesn't "It is finished" mean that Christ's mission was successful and<br>
that, had it not been successful, the sin problem would not have had a<br>
successful resolution?  Isn't the "power for victory over sin" completely<br>
wrapped up in Christ and His ministry of atonement?  Remember that NO ONE<br>
was found worthy in heaven or earth to open the seal but the Lamb that was<br>
slain from the foundation of the world.  I don't believe there is another<br>
power over sin other than that which resides in Christ.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  But Christ, coming to this world, still had</i><br>
<i>&gt;  a connection with God by virtue of His own Deity.</i><br>
<p>
This speaks to my previous point.  Christ maintained a His connection with<br>
Deity in a way that differs from all others who have ever lived.  He was<br>
"the holy One."  He COULD have exercised the powers of the Universe on His<br>
behalf, yet chose not to so that His mission could be fulfilled.  EGW says<br>
that Christ COULD have drawn strength from His divine nature but did not. <br>
He remained fully diety while being fully man -- this is the great mystery.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Now that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christ has offered Himself for us, we have access to the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; power in Him that He had in God.</i><br>
<p>
Christ is much more than just the offering.  He is the Creator of the<br>
Universe.  He is the High Priest.  He is the Coming King of Glory.  He is<br>
our justification, our sanctification, and our righteousness.  The power<br>
of God that Christ had was His own by virtue of His co-equal status with<br>
the Father and the Spirit.  He did not go outside Himself to another to<br>
work out our redemption.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Before Christ died, there was</i><br>
<i>&gt; still power for victory available, but it was apparently more</i><br>
<i>&gt; limited, depending on a future atonement.</i><br>
<p>
Depending on the Atonement.... exactly.  Everything depends and revolves<br>
around Christ and Him Crucified.<br>

I said recently that I thought the differences between the various SDA<br>
factions are largely based on approach and priorities. Now I am going to<br>
try and explain what I mean by that. I hope what I have said here is<br>
clear enough to be understood!! (NB this is around 95 lines worth)<br>
<p>
<p>
====================================================<br>
<p>
THOUGHTS PERTAINING TO DISPUTE WITHIN ADVENTISM<br>
^^^^^^^^---------------------------------------<br>
<p>
It's mostly caused by poor communication, knee-jerk reactions and the<br>
eternal pendulum-swinging phenomenon.<br>
<p>
Take the perceived role of Ellen White. From the 20s through 50s the church<br>
leaders and writers portrayed a somewhat "fundamentalist" approach to the<br>
writings of Ellen White, with some of them teaching verbal inspiration and<br>
infallibility of the written word, and so on. Hence when Rea and Numbers<br>
came up with their material, it was a major shock to a large proportion of<br>
grass-roots SDAs. The two extreme reactions tended to be (1) ignore the<br>
problem and blame Rea and Numbers for bringing it up, and (2) abandon Ellen<br>
White completely.<br>
<p>
The legacy of that situation is what we face today. As soon as someone appears<br>
to question even an application of Ellen White's writings, letalone question<br>
the interpretation or content, the right wing immediately assumes that said<br>
someone has adopted reaction (2), and starts preaching about doubting the<br>
"Spirit of Prophecy". And dare to actually quote from Ellen White to help<br>
resolve questions of Scriptural interpretation, or to help determine <br>
worthwhile lifestyle principles, and the left wing assumes that reaction (1)<br>
has been adopted and starts preaching "sola scriptura" and "principle, not<br>
policy".<br>
<p>
Take the other debate, involving sin, the nature of Christ, and righteousness<br>
by faith. Mention a commandment, victory over sin, or a lifestyle issue, and<br>
straight away those on the left start in with charges of legalism, <br>
perfectionism and "righteousness by works". Speak of social issues, God's love,<br>
or relationships, and from the right will come accusations of Calvinism, "once<br>
saved, always saved", antinomianism, and New Theology.<br>
<p>
It's gotten to the point where some discussion/sermon topics are "safe" and<br>
others are not. Certain important aspects of Christianity are being avoided<br>
because people are concerned about being labelled one way or the other, or<br>
maybe even being weighed and found wanting by both sides.<br>
<p>
Even on SDAnet (!) there have been times where this has occurred. I could be<br>
wrong, but I think that those who post long messages about overcoming sin<br>
and the nature of Christ do so because they think their readers believe that<br>
God requires nothing of them, and that Christ's sacrifice is wholly to allow<br>
God to ignore a person's sinful living. They insist that God *requires* this<br>
and *requires* that, to counter the perceived belief that God really doesn't<br>
mind one way or the other since all he sees is Jesus.<br>
<p>
Those who respond do so because they see legalism and a focus on actions,<br>
with no mention of the reciprocal love between Christ and the Christian. These<br>
insist that nothing is *required* except to accept Jesus as our substitute,<br>
to counter the perceived belief that a Christian will not be accepted by<br>
God unless he/she has no sin or sinful propensity.<br>
<p>
In actual fact, it is safe to say that the perceptions are wrong in almost<br>
every case.<br>
<p>
The complete right-wing package is probably not too different to the complete<br>
left-wing package, theologically at least. It is just the emphasis that is<br>
different, and it seems to me that this emphasis is largely there to counter<br>
the other side's emphasis (get that??). Hence the problem is self-propagating.<br>
<p>
An example: Christ said "If you love me, keep my commandments".<br>
<p>
He didn't say, "If you love me, that's just great!",<br>
<p>
or just        "Keep my commandments, o human race!"<br>
<p>
Surely all agree that the entire sentence is important, and that both aspects<br>
are essential for a full understanding of the gospel. If it seems that part<br>
of the text is being ignored, it is only natural that the other part will<br>
be emphasized in order to restore the balance.<br>
<p>
If I'm right, then I find that a little encouraging. But that still doesn't<br>
provide a solution to the problem. Any solution would necessarily involve<br>
open discussion, with both sides agreeing not to threaten or intimidate, and<br>
both also agreeing not to become defensive at the mere hint of difference.<br>
Often such hints are misunderstood. <br>
<p>
=============================================<br>
<p>
Well, I never realized an oversimplification could constitute so many lines<br>
of text!<br>
<p>
By the way, I'm still waiting for hints on how literally to interpret Ellen<br>
White's visions. Personal e-mail would be fine if you don't want to "brave"<br>
publicly airing your own filter technique!<br>

The nature of Christ is going to be a healthy topic among other mysteries<br>
we study for eternity. I like to think of Christ as 100% human and<br>
100% divine. <br>

In response to Noe Torres' message:<br>
<p>
You raise the point -- Christ ``did not go outside Himself to another<br>
to work out our redemption.''<br>
<p>
But what about statements like John 5:19:<br>
<p>
``The Son can do nothing of Himself, but only what He seeth the Father<br>
do: for what things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son<br>
likewise.''<br>
<p>
The trinity is a great mystery.  But the Bible presents the<br>
relationship of Jesus to the Father in terms of Christ depending on a<br>
power outside of Himself, namely, that of the Father.  And Ellen White<br>
speaks of this in the same way.  Of course, since Christ and the<br>
Father are one, in another sense Christ is depending on His own power.<br>
But I think that the Bible and Ellen White try to present this subject<br>
to us in terms of dependence on an outside power.  This is the best<br>
way for us to understand the subject.  Consider John 6:57:<br>
<p>
``As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father: so he<br>
that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me.''<br>

I initiated this topic to dicuss other beings. However it has evolved into<br>
something interesting and similar to the point I was making aout other<br>
beings. Some have stated that they can't perceive a loving God that reviews<br>
the evil satan causes on a case by case basis and that this would ruin their<br>
image of God. <br>
Why wouldn't the almighty God e ale to keep up with everything that goes on<br>
in a planet that he created (sorry, the above scribble should be 'be able').<br>
Of course he knows and allows the suffering of each individual. Do you you <br>
think he only keeps up with a select few friends? The fact that we think this<br>
is so horrible shows that we aren't looking on a broader scale (which was my<br>
point about other beings). We must remember that God has the entire universe<br>
to consider when making decisions. The great controversy is not just limited<br>
to earth. We are just the unlucky beings who have to deal with satan bothering<br>
us. God does care for those who suffer even when he allows the suffering. We <br>
must keep our faith just as Job did and accept the sovereignty of God.<br>

The humanity of Christ, with which He clothed Himself in order to carry<br>
out the great mission, did rely on faith in and strengthening from the<br>
Father.  You are correct.  Because Christ voluntarily DENIED HIMSELF<br>
ACCESS to His rightful Divine prerogatives, He did not draw from His<br>
divinity to sustain His humanity.  He COULD have, but He did not.<br>
<p>
This does not make Christ a "lesser God," as some teach.  Our church has<br>
always taught that Christ is fully equal to the Father.<br>

In response to Sherman's question:( "Does everyone or I should say a vast<br>
majority of adventists believe in the complete overcoming of all sin in this<br>
life thorugh the power of God?" )I would state that it is our goal as<br>
Christians to seek Christ first and let the overcoming of sin be a marvelous<br>
task of the Holy Spirit working within us rather than our own task.  Any<br>
victory over sin is totally the work of Christ and the Holy Spirit working in<br>
our lives.  Is it possible that all sin may be overcome in our lives?  Yes,<br>
with God all things are possible, but the victory is His not ours.  "If we<br>
claim to be without sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.  If<br>
we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and<br>
purify us from all unrighteousness." 1John 1:9.<br>

<i>&gt;Yes, it is tremendously important to recognize that Christ was fully human.</i><br>

<p>
I think that the reason why there is so much interest in what sort of human<br>
Jesus was and is, is mainly because people ask if His example is followable<br>
by us. If He was in some way less succeptible to the kind of temptations we<br>
are exposed to, if he did not have our sinful tendencies, then perhaps he<br>
had an advantage over us and so we don't actually have much hope of actually<br>
following Him as a followable example in Christian living.<br>
<p>
Actually, the gospel of salvation is so simple even a child can understand<br>
it, and sometimes i think we make it too complicated and confusing, when all<br>
we have to do is trust and obey.<br>
	The bible says we are to follow Jesus, to be like Him, that we will<br>
have help in doing so, that we will never be tempted beyond what we are able<br>
to bear, that it is God and not us, that will transform our characters --<br>
all we have to do is go along with Him and trust Him, that Jesus is our<br>
saviour from sin, that is what His name means. It also says that Jesus was<br>
tempted in all points as we are, so he knows how its like and can help us<br>
when we are tempted, it also says he was without sin.<br>
	As far as i'm concerned, if Jesus took all the trouble to become a<br>
man and live among us sinners, becoming so much like us, although He is God,<br>
that most people couldn't recognise Him, to show us how to live, then why<br>
don't we just follow Him and not worry so much about it. Trust and obey,<br>
there's no other way, to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey. Simple as<br>
that.<br>

<i>&gt;QUESTIONS:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Is this "power of God" separate and independent from the Atonement?  If</i><br>
<i>&gt;not, how is it related to the Atonement? </i><br>
The power of God is the power that is bestowed through the Atonement.<br>
In my mind the purpose of the Atonement is to cleanse the people of God <br>
from sin.  This power to overcome is every bit a free gift, just like<br>
justification.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are we to be our own "little saviors"? </i><br>
I say no.  But I would like to hear the opinions of the historically <br>
correct on this one.<br>

<i>&gt; To shift the topic just a tad, I was told recently (last Sabbath) that our</i><br>
<i>&gt; scientists are to the point or almost to the point where they can</i><br>
write genes.<br>
<i>&gt; Is this true?  Apparently, once a new gene is written and introduced there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; no way to remove it from the population (you can make it recessive but</i><br>
you can<br>
<i>&gt; not eliminate it).  Are we going to have gene hackers like the</i><br>
computer people<br>
<i>&gt; that introduce computer viruses? </i><br>
<p>
Although I am not a PhD in Genetic Engineering, I do know that at the present<br>
time, we should not be worrying about gene hackers creating new genes.  We can<br>
indeed read the human genetic code (i.e. the human genome project underway), <br>
but the results of this project are simply a sequence of nucleic acids.  What<br>
does a sequence such as ATGTAGTGCGTAGT mean?  Who knows!  We can identify the<br>
sequences that make up some specific proteins, but we have no clue how the <br>
structure of the body is encoded.<br>
<p>
As far as writing genes goes, we can write specific nucleic acids in sequence.<br>
But here again, we don't know what they do.  We just don't know enough to go<br>
off creating a new creature.  We do know some specifics, but trying to create<br>
a new gene from scratch would be like trying to create a new computer by <br>
scratching the disk drive with a pin.  <br>

When people claim to be proponents of "historic Adventism," a crucial (and<br>
usually unasked) question is: WHICH "historic Adventism"? The Adventism of<br>
1844? Of 1863? Of 1888? Of 1901? Of 1915? Of 1952? of 1980? <br>
<p>
Adventism is (and always has been) a living, dynamic religious community,<br>
and it is both foolish and futile to expect otherwise. Like individual<br>
believers, when a religion stops changing, it is dead. If this sounds too<br>
"liberal" or "progressive" to some, they may with profit recall some words<br>
of Ellen White: <br>
<p>
	"There is no excuse for anyone in taking the position that there<br>
is no more truth to be revealed, and that all our expositions of Scripture<br>
are without an error. The fact that certain doctrines have been held as<br>
truth for many years by our people is not a proof that our ideas are<br>
infallible. Age will not make error into truth, and truth can afford to be<br>
fair. No true doctrine will lose anything by close investigation."<br>
["Review and Herald," December 20, 1892]<br>
<p>
	"We have many lessons to learn, and many, many to unlearn. God and<br>
heaven alone are infallible. Those who think that they will never have to<br>
give up a cherished view, never have occasion to change an opinion, will<br>
be disappointed." ["Review and Herald," July 26, 1892]<br>
<p>
	"Whenever the people of God are growing in grace, they will be<br>
constantly obtaining a clearer understanding of His Word. They will<br>
discern new light and beauty in its sacred truths. This has been true in<br>
the history of the church in all ages, and thus it will continue to the<br>
end. But as real spiritual life declines, it has ever been the tendency to<br>
cease to advance in the knowledge of the truth. Men rest satisfied with<br>
the light already received from God's Word, and discourage any further<br>
investigation of the Scriptures. They become conservative, and seek to<br>
avoid discussion." ["Testimonies for the Church," vol.5, pp. 706-7]<br>
<p>
None of this means that we should be disrespectful of our theological<br>
heritage. Indeed, we should take it very seriously--but not absolutely. It<br>
is a foundation on which to build, not a corral in which to be confined.<br>

Most creation-believing scientists, including myself, point out that <br>
a strong argument against the evolution scenario, is that abiogenesis<br>
(creation of life by some means other than reproduction) has not been <br>
observed to occur.  But what would happen to such an argument<br>
if scientists were to someday start with basic alcohols and inorganic<br>
reagents and proceed to synthesize a living cell from scratch?<br>
<p>
Before the moon landing, SDA preachers were preaching that God would never<br>
allow sinful men to land on the moon and spread sin elsewhere.  But it<br>
happened.  <br>
<p>
It is easy to hide behind the "God of the Gaps" theory and postulate God<br>
as the moving force behind all that is unknown.  But then God must<br>
necessarily shrink as scientific knowledge grows, until as Laplace said<br>
"I have no need of that hypothesis."<br>
<p>
I would propose that we spend more time in emphasizing the role of God<br>
in that which we do understand.  I don't know how God creates a cell,<br>
but I have a pretty good understanding about how He does a photon or<br>
an electron, and hopefully before my thesis is done I'll have a handle<br>
on the Sigma-minus particle as well.  A miracle that is understood <br>
is no less of a miracle.<br>

[Or, which syllable of Ad-ven-tist do YOU stress]<br>
<p>
In a couple days we will find out if our country has learned anything <br>
from the last spate of riots.  It's also an opportune time to consider<br>
whether our church has made any progress over the last year.  <br>
In the suburbs of Chicago and in the field of high-energy physics I am <br>
rather isolated from the problem of race relations currently.  I have <br>
the strong feeling that the kids I work with are more isolated and<br>
sheltered than myself.  They have no idea what it would be like to live<br>
in the inner<br>
city or a third-world country.  And there are only 12 African Americans<br>
out of 2000 or so people in my field.  <br>
<p>
The walls of organizational apartheid in the SDA church are still high.<br>
There is no overall strategy to reach the city of Chicago because the <br>
black conference wants to do it one way and the white conference another.<br>
(The union office was able to reach agreement for a strategy in Detroit,<br>
so I'm not sure what the holdup is.)  <br>
<p>
But I've talked to enough leaders and grass-roots people to realize that<br>
there are real reasons why the "agenda" of black leaders in the SDA<br>
church<br>
is different from that of white leaders is different from that of<br>
hispanic leaders is different from............  Rather than trying to<br>
impose a solution on both sides, we need to look at the basic inequities<br>
which still remain in our system and work on removing them so we can<br>
finally come to one accord.  There is a window of time in which we still<br>
speak the same language<br>
and understand each other's terms.  During this short window,<br>
communication is possible.  After that, I'm afraid the groups may<br>
diverge.<br>
<p>
I'm concerned not because the record is bad in Illinois, but the record <br>
is in fact fairly good, and we are still a long ways apart.  Illinois<br>
Conference has a good record of diversity, and I want to see that<br>
continue.<br>
Another good sign is that James Humphries, church ministries director <br>
for Lake Region, came to our big youth rally this spring and extended<br>
his hand in a call for collaboration and cooperation.  We are trying to<br>
make<br>
as good use of this opportunity as we can.<br>
<p>

To tell the truth, I had forgotten about it, in the mad rush of things.<br>
I will dig it out and post the instructions and rules (you better believe<br>
there are rules to this thing.  You can generate some mighty wild conflicts<br>
when people start communicating).  You *HAVE* to know how to handle them.<br>
It is fairly simple, you set a date, specific time, day and place to<br>
discuss the problem issue for conflict resolution.  Give your self several<br>
days.  ]<br>

I think the Atonement is much more than a cleansing from sin.  It is the<br>
great mystery of all time that even the angels are awed by.  It is by the<br>
Atonement that healing will eventually come to a universe stricken with<br>
the cancer of sin.  EGW says that even the heavenly beings are not secure<br>
except by looking to the Atonement.... an awesome thought.  EGW also says<br>
that we don't really understand the full implications of what happened at<br>
Calvary as we should.<br>

Pam, I think you are 100% correct.  The only "asterisk" being that Christ's<br>
spiritual nature was never touched by sin as ours is.  Had he in His mind<br>
given in to sin, all would have been lost; thus, He accomplished that<br>
which Adam and Eve failed to do: remain faithful and unaffected by the<br>
enemy's temptations.  This is why the Bible refers to Christ as the Second<br>
Adam.<br>

Wonderfully stated, David.  I agree completely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since Pentecost the Holy Spirit has been poured out in fuller measure.</i><br>
<p>
The Spirit, though, does not act independently of Christ or independently<br>
of His Atoning work.  The Spirit ministers to each believer the<br>
fruits (benefits) of Christ's Atonement.  Christ said that the Spirit<br>
would not speak of Himself.  The power imparted by the Spirit to us is not<br>
a power that is independent of Christ -- it is an extension of Christ's<br>
glorious victory at the cross, in my opinion.<br>

I somehow feel the key to this is that Christ's human nature, which was<br>
denied access to power from His divine nature for use on Himself, relied<br>
on faith and trust in the Father.  The Father, through the Spirit and the<br>
ministering angels, worked to strengthen the human nature of Christ.  I<br>
have an EGW statement at home that I'll post later that hits this point<br>
right on the head.<br>

<i>&gt; Can someone give me a ftp-address where I can get this software.</i><br>
<p>
I know of three types of sources for this.<br>
<p>
1.  The current issue of Christianity Today has an insert with a table<br>
that reviews about 25 PC Bible packages.  Some of these are quite<br>
inexpensive.<br>
<p>
2.  You can get CD-ROMs with something like 9 versions plus<br>
concordances on them.<br>
<p>
3.  You can get the KJV raw text via FTP as described below.  You can<br>
also get all kinds of other texts such as the CIA World Factbook.<br>

Here is an interesting story about a bunch of people arguing over the nature<br>
of Jesus Christ and, and on how Jesus Himself reacted to that:--<br>
<p>
...Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was<br>
a Sabbath. Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his<br>
sight. "He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I<br>
see."<br>
     Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not<br>
keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner do such miraculous<br>
signs?" So they were divided.<br>
     Finally they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about<br>
him? It was your eyes he opened."  The man replied, "He is a prophet."  The<br>
Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight<br>
until they sent for the man's parents.<br>
     "Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this the one you say was born blind?<br>
How is it that now he can see?"    "We know he is our son," the parents<br>
answered, "and we know he was born blind. But how he can see now, or who<br>
opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for<br>
himself." His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for<br>
already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the<br>
Christ would be put out of the synagogue. That was why his parents said, "He<br>
is of age; ask him."<br>
     A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to<br>
God," they said. "We know this man is a sinner." He replied, "Whether he is<br>
a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I<br>
see!"<br>
     Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"<br>
He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want<br>
to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?" Then they hurled<br>
insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of<br>
Moses! We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even<br>
know where he comes from."<br>
     The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes<br>
from, yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners. He<br>
listens to the godly man who does his will. Nobody has ever heard of opening<br>
the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do<br>
nothing."<br>
     To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you<br>
lecture us!" And they threw him out. Jesus heard that they had thrown him<br>
out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" <br>
"Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him."<br>
Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with<br>
you." Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him.<br>

produce human antibodies and pharmaceutical chemicals, and we can mix genes,<br>
like when they implanted a firefly gene in a tobacco plant, or like the<br>
mouse which they wanted to copyright because they put some human genes in it<br>
or something, and we can alter the way genes express or make cells with<br>
abnormal numbers of chromosomes (like some plants we can cause to grow to<br>
Cannanite proportions by making them polyploid). Perhaps that was how the<br>
ante diluveans made their confusing amalgamations.<br>

It might be possible soon, to clone a dinosaur from dinosaur DNA, if we can<br>
find it. A more likely subject for cloning are preserved wolly mammoths<br>

Bill, thanks for the request for info on Rancho La Brea.  I've been to the<br>
Page Museum several times and have spent time exploring the paleo rooms with<br>
George Jefferson as our guide.  He has been doing some really interesting<br>
research in the past five years but I'm not sure just what has been published.<br>
I'm too swamped to pursue this right now so please be patient with me.  I'll<br>
try to put something together on this soon.  The explanation of the deposit is<br>
a little more complex than the scenario presented by the museum film.  For<br>
those who are not aware:  Rancho La Brea is a park and museum in downtown Los<br>
Angeles.  The region consists of tar pits, natural seeps of oil/tar and a rich<br>
late Pleistocene fauna (mammals, rodents, birds, insects...) preserved in the<br>
deposits.  Elaine<br>

<i>&gt;He [Adam] allowed Eve to eat the fruit, while he stood right by her.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then he ate some of the fruit himself.</i><br>
<p>
To imply that Adam sinned by not interfering with Eve's decision to<br>
eat the fruit is to imply that Eve did not have freedom of choice and<br>
was not, therefore, fully human. Is this what you meant to imply by<br>
discussing "spiritual headship?" Each had a choice and each made<br>
that choice for perhaps different reasons. But wasn't each individual<br>
totally responsible for that decision? <br>

The first time that the bible mentions that the man will rule over the<br>
woman, is in the context of the curse of God on the fallen pair. This seems<br>
to imply that things were different before the fall.  This is speculation,<br>
but i have a notion that before the fall, there would have been no need of<br>
spiritual leaders, or priests of the family or so on, because people were<br>
perfectly spiritual, and there would have been no risk of "trouble in a<br>
house" because they didn't "see eye to eye on things." Ellen White seems to<br>
support this too, in Patriachs and Prophets. Anyway, after the fall, that is<br>
now, things are very different, relationships have changed, but if we<br>
Adventists are so fond of recommending vegetarianism just because that was<br>
how it was like in Eden, why not also similar roles in the family for men<br>
and women? That was how it was in Eden after all. Just some stuff to think<br>
about.<br>

I've mentioned a few EGW statements in this thread, but hadn't had time to<br>
actually post them.  They follow:<br>
<p>
THAT THE ATONEMENT ACCOMPLISHED MUCH MORE THAN MANY PEOPLE REALIZE<br>
====================================================================<br>
"The angels ascribe honor and glory to Christ, for even they are not<br>
secure except by looking to the sufferings of the Son of God.  It is<br>
through the efficacy of the cross that the angels of heaven are guarded<br>
from apostasy.  Without the cross they would be no more secure against<br>
evil than were the angels before the fall of Satan.  Angelic perfection<br>
failed in heaven.  Human perfection failed in Eden, the paradise of bliss.<br>
 All who wish for security in earth or heaven must look to the Lamb of God.<br>
<p>
"The plan of savation, making manifest the justice and love of God,<br>
provides an eternal safeguard against defection in unfallen worlds, as<br>
well as among those who shall be redeemed by the blood of the Lamb."<br>
(5BC 1132).<br>
<p>
THAT THERE IS NO POWER FOR VICTORY OVER SIN OTHER THAN CHRIST'S<br>
================================================================<br>
"That which alone can effectually restrain from sin in this world of<br>
darkness will prevent sin in heaven.  The significance of the death of<br>
Christ will be seen by saints and angels." (ST Dec. 30, 1889).<br>
<p>
"The brand of sin upon the soul can be effaced only through the blood of<br>
the atoning Sacrifice.  No less an offering was required than the sacifice<br>
of Him who was equal with the Father." (1SM 371)<br>
<p>
CHRIST'S SINLESS STATE<br>
=======================<br>
"[Christ] is a brother in our infirmities, but not in possessing like<br>
passions.  As the sinless One, His nature recoiled from evil." (2T 202).<br>
<p>
"In his humanity, Christ was tried with as much greater temptation, with<br>
as much more persevering energy than man is tried by the evil one, as his<br>
nature was greater than man's." (RH 12/20/1892)<br>
<p>
"...with human nature upon Him, [Christ] met the arch-apostate face to<br>
face, and singlehanded withstood the foe of His throne.  Not even by a<br>
thought could Christ be brought to yield to the power of temptation." (7BC<br>
927)<br>
<p>
"He [Christ] vanquished Satan in the same nature over which in Eden Satan<br>
obtained the victory." (5BC 1108)<br>
<p>
"Christ conquered as the sinless, unfallen, perfect Man." (UL 17)<br>
<p>
"Christ did not possess the same sinful, corrupt, fallen disloyalty we<br>
possess, for then He could not be a perfect offering."  (3SM 131)<br>
<p>
THAT CHRIST COULD HAVE DRAWN FROM HIS DIVINE NATURE, BUT DID NOT<br>
=================================================================<br>
"He [Christ] might have helped His human nature to withstand the inroads<br>
of disease by pouring from His divine nature vitality and undecaying vigor<br>
to the human.  But He humbled Himself to man's nature.  He did this that<br>
the Scripture might be fulfilled."  (5BC 1127)<br>
<p>
THAT CHRIST MAINTAINED HIS DIVINE AUTHORITY EVEN WHILE CLOTHED IN HUMANITY<br>
===========================================================================<br>
"Christ has all power in heaven and in earth.... Over the winds and the<br>
waves and over men possessed with demons, He showed that He possessed<br>
absolute control.  To Him have been given the keys of death and of hell. <br>
Principalities and powers were made subject to Him, even while in His<br>
humiliation." (1SM 83)<br>

This wouldn't be a problem, as a creationist, since it would only<br>
prove that it takes "intelligence" to make life from scratch.  Unless<br>
scientists can show that life can come about without any intervention<br>
by man -- or other animals -- creationists can rest at ease.<br>
<p>
(The same rule applies to language.  So far, scientists have yet to<br>
show that language can come about without any intervention by another<br>
language-user.  All the animal research studies are naught, since, so<br>
far, they have been accomplished by direct intervention by<br>
language-users, i.e.  research scientists.  They have only shown that<br>
it takes a helping hand from a language-user to become another<br>
language-user -- something linguists have been saying for the last 30<br>
years or so.  At least, the non-creationist-linguists have smartened<br>
up by no longer discussing the origin of language -- since the only<br>
possible source of the original language is either extra-terrestrial<br>
beings or -- gasp! -- God.)<br>

I appreciate Steve's point that our love of Christ should be the distinction<br>
between Christians and non-Christians. However the original question of<br>
distinctives was addressed more towards the evangelical statement of beliefs.<br>
Clearly Ruben was trying to point something out by asking us did we think<br>
we should all be Seventh-day Baptists, I would very much like to know what<br>
that was.<br>
<p>
Please don't misunderstand, I am the last person to say we should dwell on<br>
our distinctives. I am not trying to make a big issue out of this. It's just<br>
that I am putting forth a serious effort to discover exactly what all of<br>
those guys believe, and establish where I stand on all of it. Again, if you<br>
are willing to prepare a brief summary of what you think should distinguish<br>
"Seventh-day Adventist Christian" from "Seventh-day Baptist Christian", and<br>
you are worried about starting an argument, send it direct to me!<br>

Hi Steve,<br>
<p>
I don't mean to start a creation-evolution discussion here, and anyway,<br>
there are no evolutionists to argue with me here, but the fact of God's<br>
creatorship (see 1st angel's message and 2Pe 3:3-7) and how the work of God,<br>
like the Word of God, speaks volumes about Him (Ps 19:1-3, Rom 1:20) are<br>
things of great interest to SDAs, or so i think.<br>
[Evolutionists are here, but they keep their mouth shut.  SCT]<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;observed to occur.  But what would happen to such an argument</i><br>
<i>&gt;if scientists were to someday start with basic alcohols and inorganic</i><br>
<i>&gt;reagents and proceed to synthesize a living cell from scratch?</i><br>
<p>
Well, we are yet far removed from that possibility. I don't think they can<br>
even bring a dead cell, with all its parts in place, back to life, let alone<br>
make a new one from scratch. They used to think, in the early days of<br>
evolutionary theory, that the cell was just a buble of fluid with some fats,<br>
proteins and so on, and if you shake some organic soup up in a reducing<br>
atmosphere with some lightning and UV radiation and do other elaborate<br>
things to it, you just might eventually get a cell. But with the advent of<br>
the electron microscope and other modern methods of investigation, we know<br>
know that even the smallest unit of living matter is fearfully and<br>
wonderfully made. I mean, looking at electron micrographs of cell<br>
ultrastructure, i wonder how anyone in their right mind can imagine that all<br>
that happened by small doses of increadibly good luck over eons. Although<br>
intelligent human beings using complex processes and devices, have been<br>
shown to be able to synthesize simple biological molecules and polymers, the<br>
reverse has not been demonstrated, that given time, simple biological<br>
molecules can arrange themselves into intelligent human beings.<br>
	This same combination of unimaginable complexity and despite that,<br>
the increadible harmony and well-designed, for want of a better word, way<br>
in which natural systems operate, is seen in the biochemistry and physiology<br>
of plants and animals. How, for example, their enzymes work under precisely<br>
the right conditions and in precisely the right way, how the half-lives of<br>
hormones are tuned to the systems they regulate, how physiological<br>
parameters and biochemical pathways are so exactly regulated, at precisely<br>
the best places in order to achieve optimum efficiency and performance, how<br>
cells and even molecules, respond in just the right way to changes in their<br>
environments, in order to fulfill their functions, the list goes on. Praise<br>
be to God, for all His works, in wisdom are they all made!<br>
	Of course, only a Christian can fully appreciate the things of<br>
nature, for he can discern the character his master in the work of His<br>
mouth.  Evolutionists would ascribe all the marvels of nature to<br>
unintelligent and meaningless chance that has less than a one in a million<br>
probability of happening in a million years. Its amazing what some people<br>
will believe.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Before the moon landing, SDA preachers were preaching that God would never</i><br>
<i>&gt;allow sinful men to land on the moon and spread sin elsewhere.  But it</i><br>
<i>&gt;happened.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, thats what comes of preaching things not found in the bible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It is easy to hide behind the "God of the Gaps" theory and postulate God</i><br>
<i>&gt;as the moving force behind all that is unknown.  But then God must</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessarily shrink as scientific knowledge grows, until as Laplace said</i><br>
<i>&gt;"I have no need of that hypothesis."</i><br>
<p>
True enough. A regular atheist contributor to the religion conference in<br>
my University's bulletin board put it thus:<br>
	"All I can say is: God ought to put in more effort [to make Himself<br>
known to man]. Because so far, all He has succeded in doing is to produce a<br>
Universe which looks exactly as it would if He didn't exist." Although<br>
i don't agree with him, i can understand what he means.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I would propose that we spend more time in emphasizing the role of God</i><br>
<i>&gt;in that which we do understand.  I don't know how God creates a cell,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I have a pretty good understanding about how He does a photon or</i><br>
<i>&gt;an electron, and hopefully before my thesis is done I'll have a handle</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the Sigma-minus particle as well.  A miracle that is understood </i><br>
<i>&gt;is no less of a miracle.</i><br>
<p>
True enough and well said. May God help you in your hunt for exotic<br>
particles!<br>
	Steve, do you know a guy called Weng Kee Leong? He is now lecturing<br>
Physics and Chemistry at Southeast Asia Union College, and attends my church,<br>
and he said he knows you. If you know him, it will be the second time i've<br>
met someone on SDAnet who knows someone else i know.<br>

AMEN.  Turn your eyes upon Jesus....  The most wonderful "works" of<br>
Christianity have been accomplished by men and women whose eyes were fixed<br>
upon Christ and who did what they did NOT out of a sense of obligation,<br>

done for them.  This is the "service of love," which is the only service<br>
acceptable to God.  To seek to do God's will out of a sense of urgency or<br>

trusting in God, but afraid to be lost.<br>
<p>
As we seek to do Christ's will out of gratitute, love, appreciation for<br>
His wonderous love toward us -- without reference to church politics,<br>
without concern for our well-being or our own salvation, without any<br>
self-centeredness -- then we are close to the answer.  And the answer will<br>
reveal that as we draw closer to Christ, we will more clearly see our own<br>
imperfections and flaws in the light of His glorious character.<br>

Dan,<br>
The Atonement to me is the one, ultimate, defining act of God for<br>
eternity.  It is the act of God that, through love, establishes forever<br>
His authority and character.  It is the "at-one-ment," meaning that the<br>
universe is healed and made "one" again when, as a direct result of<br>
Christ's sacrifice on Calvary, final judgment descends upon Satan and his<br>
followers and the universe is cleansed forever of the cancer of sin. <br>
Affliction shall not arise a second time, the Bible says.<br>
<p>
The Atonement was conceived in the council of peace before our world was<br>
created, it was set into motion after the rebellion of Adam and Eve, its<br>
climax came in the perfect life and atoning death of the God-man Jesus<br>
Christ, and there remains just a "short span" until the plan of redemption<br>
concludes.<br>
<p>
We don't understand the full implications of the Atonement.  It is an<br>
event more glorious than words can describe.  Aspects of it will remain a<br>
mystery for all eternity.  Few statements I've ever read speak to the<br>
glory of the Atonement as well as the one that follows:<br>
<p>
<p>
"The angels ascribe honor and glory to Christ, for even they are not<br>
secure except by looking to the sufferings of the Son of God.  It is<br>
through the efficacy of the cross that the angels of heaven are guarded<br>
from apostasy.  Without the cross they would be no more secure against<br>
evil than were the angels before the fall of Satan.  Angelic perfection<br>
failed in heaven.  Human perfection failed in Eden, the paradise of bliss.<br>
 All who wish for security in earth or heaven must look to the Lamb of God.<br>
<p>
"The plan of savation, making manifest the justice and love of God,<br>
provides an eternal safeguard against defection in unfallen worlds, as<br>
well as among those who shall be redeemed by the blood of the Lamb."<br>
(5BC 1132).<br>
<p>
My apologies for any 50-cent words I may have used....<br>

<i>&gt;Just as you run into trouble in a house where you have two heads of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;house in other areas, I believe that you will have trouble if you have two</i><br>
<i>&gt;spiritual leaders, particularly if the two spouses don't see eye to eye on</i><br>
<i>&gt;things.</i><br>
<p>
"You will have trouble"--to whom are you speaking?  Oh, yes, I forgot the<br>
assumption in this technological arena is that the only people on the net<br>
are males.  And, what's more these persons (males) so intent on keeping control<br>
of everything controllable must counsel each other on how to maintain<br>
control of that group of technologically inept persons--women.  <br>
I hope you have a great deal of trouble<br>
from the person you wish to control.  <br>
<p>
The Holy One created us all to have an individual relationship with Her.<br>
Any person interferring with that divine relationship is stepping out<br>
their human condition/position and attempting to play God--but then<br>
isn't that what a great many males do and use the scriptures to<br>
justify in this group of<br>
believers.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;He [Adam] allowed Eve to eat the fruit, while he stood right by her.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Then he ate some of the fruit himself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To imply that Adam sinned by not interfering with Eve's decision to</i><br>
<i>&gt; eat the fruit is to imply that Eve did not have freedom of choice and</i><br>
<i>&gt; was not, therefore, fully human. </i><br>
<p>
Therefore one should never act to interfere with someone sinful<br>
behavior?<br>
<p>
I think that *forcing* someone to do or not do something is not<br>
necessarily synonymous with "interfering" with them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is this what you meant to imply by</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussing "spiritual headship?" Each had a choice and each made</i><br>
<i>&gt; that choice for perhaps different reasons. But wasn't each individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; totally responsible for that decision? </i><br>
<p>
Absolutely, whether or not anyone interfered with their decision to<br>
do (or not) anything.<br>

In reply to Pam Harris's comment on Adam's headship.<br>
<p>
Yes, both Eve and Adam were responsible for their own sin.  Adam was<br>
guilty of abdicating his spiritual headship over Eve, his wife.  But Eve<br>
was also responsible for her part in the sin.<br>
<p>
If you look at how things transpire when God confronts Adam, Eve, and<br>
even the serpent, you see that God first confronts Adam.  Eve was the<br>
first to take a bite of the fruit, but God holds Adam first responsible.<br>
 Then Adam goes and puts the blame on God, for producing the woman.<br>
<p>
Then God confronts Eve, but she puts the blame on the serpent.  All<br>
three were guilty of sin.  All threee were confronted by God.  And all<br>
three recieved a curse from God.<br>
<p>
Think about it, what wrong did the serpent really do?  Adam and Eve<br>
didn't have to listen to it.  But the serpent still was found guilty.  <br>
<p>
If Adam tried to stop Eve, and Eve continued, then Adam would have been<br>
free from guilt.  But Adam chose not to do this, so he is guilty.  <br>

I heard a couple of them myself (Southern California Conference).  Seemed to<br>
mostly be from retired pastors doing a guest appearance.<br>
<p>
Haven't heard any since about 1969, though.  :}<br>
<p>
Not to be ragging on any of the retired pastors, a lot of them can still<br>
teach us a lot.<br>

Tang Beng Yong replies to Sue Harrington who replied to Bruce Holm:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I sense a battle of the sexes brewing. Actually, i didn't see Bruce say</i><br>
<i>&gt;anything about females not being on the net or them not being</i><br>
<i>&gt;technologically ept. He was concerned with gender roles in the family, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;which he does have scriptural support, but which i pointed out, probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;were noy the same for Adam and Eve before they rebelled against God, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;were rather, given by God as a result of sin entering this world.</i><br>
<p>
... and other words to keep the issue into perspective...<br>
<p>
But I write:<br>
<p>
Tang, I don't want to equating women with animals (actually animals aren't all<br>
that bad) but if you've ever seen people try to help a wounded animal,<br>
you might remember seeing an animal in terror, and fighting off any approach.<br>
This is especially true if humans have harmed it.  The animal doesn't recognize<br>
that the "helpers" are any different from the harmers UNTIL caring action has<br>
been displayed.  Again, women are creatures quite a ways above "animals",<br>
but I hope you see my point.  It is extremely difficult (NOT <br>
impossible) for many<br>
women to separate the harm done to them.  And how much more difficult it is to<br>
differentiate when the oppressor has used "God" and "God's will" to abuse and<br>
demean?  The human mind which has seen Jesus is confused and - not often<br>
enough - indignant at this contradiction.  So sometimes men are greeted <br>
with the<br>
"claws" or "teeth" which women have grown to protect themselves.<br>
<p>
These protectors come in a wide diversity of forms from defensive women's<br>
organizations, or offensive organizations, down to sweeping distrust of <br>
males.<br>
Sometimes that distrust appears to, and feels like it rakes us men over <br>
the coals.<br>
Maybe it is their way of saying "IDENTIFY YOURSELF!  Are you those evil<br>
oppressors, or a helper?!"  Remember God is not mocked... we reap what we sow,<br>
and are visited with the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, <br>
THREE and<br>
FOUR generations deep.  We men have found our life in being rulers over women,<br>
I suspect that we must lose _that_ life if we expect to continue <br>
climbing up the<br>
narrow way.<br>
<p>
This is why *we all* need the healing which comes from the Atonement, if not,<br>
we will continue in the values of our traditions.<br>

Tonight the Computer Club officialy voted in its constitution and voted in<br>
new officers for next school year.  This is the first year to have such a<br>
thing and is a positive step in the right dirrection!!!  We together now<br>
work as one to improve our school's computer system.  We are working on<br>
two games currently to be brought on-line.  Tetris and Othelo.  The<br>
problem is that we are stuck to text only terminals without function keys!<br>
 Terible!!!!<br>
<p>
Today I was talking with Thompson Kay who is a Vice President at Christian<br>
Record Services.  I talked with him about the GC using e-mail.  And<br>
suggestedd we do the same.   PLEASE ANY ONE IN ANY CONFERENCE OR SCHOOL<br>
USING E-MAIL FOR WORK OR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS PLEASE WRITE HIM AND LET HIM<br>
KNOW HOW IT CAN BE USED AND WHY CRS SHOULD BE ON-LINE.   (one thing is for<br>
our reps to communicate better with us.)<br>
	Thompson Kay<br>
	CRS/Divsion for Deaf<br>
	PO Box 6097<br>
	Lincoln, NE  68506<br>
<p>
<p>
If you know of any good ways to get internet cheaply I am still trying to<br>
get Union College onto internet.<br>
<p>
Thanks for your time.<br>

Sue Harrington replies to Bruce Holm:<br>
<i>&gt;"You will have trouble"--to whom are you speaking?  Oh, yes, I forgot the</i><br>
<i>&gt;assumption in this technological arena is that the only people on the net</i><br>
<i>&gt;are males.  And, what's more these persons (males) so intent on keeping</i><br>
<i>&gt;control of everything controllable must counsel each other on how to</i><br>
<i>&gt;maintain control of that group of technologically inept persons--women.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;hope you have a great deal of trouble from the person you wish to control.</i><br>
<p>
I sense a battle of the sexes brewing. Actually, i didn't see Bruce say<br>
anything about females not being on the net or them not being<br>
technologically ept. He was concerned with gender roles in the family, for<br>
which he does have scriptural support, but which i pointed out, probably<br>
were noy the same for Adam and Eve before they rebelled against God, but<br>
were rather, given by God as a result of sin entering this world. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The Holy One created us all to have an individual relationship with Her.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Any person interferring with that divine relationship is stepping out</i><br>
<i>&gt;their human condition/position and attempting to play God--but then</i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't that what a great many males do and use the scriptures to</i><br>
<i>&gt;justify in this group of believers.</i><br>
<p>
This is new to me. Are you suggesting that God is female? All along, i had<br>
the impression that if God has gender, then God must be male, because the<br>
bible always uses "He" and "His" and so on, to refer to God. The only place<br>
that i can think of where perhaps God is described as female is when Jesus<br>
says that Jesus wished that Jesus could gather the children of Jerusalem<br>
together as a hen gathers chicks under its wings, but this does not mean<br>
that Jesus is female any more than it means that Jesus is a chicken.<br>
	Bruce did not say anything to suggest that females have any less of<br>
a relationship with God than do males. Gender roles have nothing to do with<br>
one's relationship with Him (or Her or It?) any more than being a house slave<br>
means that one cannot be a christian. (Philemon was a slave right?)<br>

And it strikes me as effective that God should use the "mother" scenario<br>
to describe himself as well as the "father" one since the mother has<br>
traditionally been more strongly involved (both in general and emotional <br>
terms) in the rearing and caring for children.<br>
<p>
And if God was female anyway - why would s/he admit it to an ancient society<br>
so strongly gripped by male domination?<br>
<p>
But also remember... God made man (generic) in his own image - male and<br>
female. Is God both male and female? Neither male or female? Surely he couldn't<br>
be just male or just female if both are his image?<br>

I feel like being picky today...<br>
<p>
----&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; But what would happen to such an argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; if scientists were to someday start with basic alcohols and inorganic</i><br>
<i>&gt; reagents and proceed to synthesize a living cell from scratch?</i><br>
<p>
This wouldn't be a problem, as a creationist, since it would only<br>
prove that it takes "intelligence" to make life from scratch.  Unless<br>
scientists can show that life can come about without any intervention<br>
by man -- or other animals -- creationists can rest at ease.<br>
&lt;----<br>
<p>
I watched "Ancient Secrets of the Bible" the other day, and noticed that<br>
many of the Biblical accounts were claimed to have been "proven correct" <br>
by scientists, anthropologists and archaeologists. The problem is that<br>
evidence in favour of something doesn't constitute the eradication of all<br>
doubt. Even in court there is a difference between "found guilty" and<br>
"proven guilty".<br>
<p>
If scientists eventually succeed in copying a living cell, or even <br>
inventing one, that will only "prove" that intelligent beings are<br>
capable of creating life. It won't prove that intelligent beings are<br>
necessary for this to occur. I think moderation of language used in<br>
such claims would even help people like myself, letalone those who<br>
don't agree at all with our position to start with!<br>

On our TV news a couple of nights ago was a report urging caution to <br>
various groups of people regarding adequate iron and calcium intake.<br>
One of the groups specifically mentioned was vegetarians. Something <br>
about how the iron in vegetables and grains isn't as easily absorbed<br>
by the body as iron in meat.<br>
<p>
Now I know that broccoli is supposed to be a good iron source. What<br>
other types of food are important to maintain adequate iron intake?<br>
I have at least one friend who suffers fatigue due to iron deficiency,<br>
and she is strictly vegetarian. I follow a vegetarian diet 99% of the<br>
time, so the normal advice "eat more red meat, or if you don't want<br>
to do that, eat dark coloured fish or chicken" is useless to me.<br>

       In Steve's essay, he suggests the possibility of one of the critical<br>
gaps in evolutionary theory may be overturned by future scientific<br>
research:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;observed to occur.  But what would happen to such an argument</i><br>
<i>&gt;if scientists were to someday start with basic alcohols and inorganic</i><br>
<i>&gt;reagents and proceed to synthesize a living cell from scratch?</i><br>
<p>
        In the debate over the possibility of artificially creating cells,<br>
the replies thus far have been centered around disproving that this is a<br>
scientific possibility.  Whether or not this particular "discovery" is<br>
likely to occur, Steve's point that creationists tend to point to the "gaps<br>
in science" as proof of God and/or His activity in creation is well taken.<br>
        There is a fundamental problem in using the inability of science to<br>
present a complete picture as evidence for the need of a god.  Most<br>
scientists will admit that scientific theory is fluid, liable to change at<br>
any time to reflect new data and evidence.  However, most Adventists would<br>
contend that there is an absoluteness about their theological theories;<br>
i.e., God does not change with time.  One cannot expect any arguments for<br>
theology to pass the test of time if they are based on temporally unstable<br>
scientific understanding.  This is certainly the case with "man cannot make<br>
a cell therefore God did."<br>
	       I guess I have seen so much evidence of "convincing arguments"<br>
being destroyed when a gap is filled that I simply cannot buy the<br>
abiogenesis argument.  Launching attacks on abiogenesis evolution does not<br>
prove creation--you cannot prove one theory by disproving another without<br>
committing a serious logical fallacy.<br>
	       Another big problem with the "gap" mentality is that it makes<br>
Christians very suspicious of scientists.  This is because the scientists'<br>
quest to fill in the gap with a natural explanation is viewed by the<br>
Christian as an attempt to disprove God.  This suspicion is also fueled, I<br>
believe, by a general misunderstand of the difference between scientific<br>
and theological methodology.<br>
	       It is the role of the Christian to point out the miracle of life,<br>
the role God plays in life.  God does work in logical ways, it should not<br>
discourage the Christian to discover that God's methods are being uncovered<br>
by science.<br>

Tony Writes:<br>
<i>&gt; Please don't misunderstand, I am the last person to say we should dwell on</i><br>
<i>&gt; our distinctives. I am not trying to make a big issue out of this. It's just</i><br>
<p>
What does "dwell on our distinctives" mean?  How much preaching of our<br>
understanding of scripture is allowed before we cross this line of "dwelling<br>
on our distictives."  How important are the distinctives?<br>
<p>
<p>
I believe this is one of the points Ruben was trying to get to.  What is the<br>
big difference between other churches and the Seventh-Day Adventist Church?<br>
Does our existance call for a preaching of the distinctives?  Are we to be<br>
different from other churches?<br>
<p>
I do not believe these questions are easy ones to answer.  We need supernatural<br>
help to answer them.  God will help us if we work toward the answers.<br>

As a church we still have the racial problems.  The segregated church services<br>
in america help to shield these things from us.  Just like in the world, the<br>
Black and the White adventist are very much different economically.  Black<br>
adventists in america usually are from the lower end of the economic ladder.<br>
Black and White adventists grow up in entirely different worlds.  I would bet<br>
that most White american Adventists are Republican, while mose Black American<br>
Adventists are Democratic.  <br>
<p>
A lot of young black Adventists are getting caught up in the Black Awakening<br>
that is going on.  A feeling of pride in blackness seems to be going around<br>
America and Blacks in the Church also are feeling this.  I would guess that <br>
the White american Church would see this black Awakening as racist.  Which<br>
shows that the church, at least on race issues, mirrors the world.<br>
<p>
Some of our difficulties stem from our detatchment from one another.  I do<br>
know where the White church is and the conference office and I even know <br>
people in the White church, but I do not feel as though I am in one of my<br>
churches when I go to it.  <br>
<p>
I hate to say it, but I feel more at home in a black "non-adventist" church<br>
than white "adventist"  churches.  There is no question that part of this is<br>
me.  I could be more open to my brothers and sisters in the "other" church.<br>
Part of this is my brothers and sisters in the "other" church.  They could<br>
be a little more open to me.  Part of this is just blacks sticking together.<br>
<p>
At work I am closer to the black people than the white people, as a rule.<br>
There are exceptions.  I guess part of it is we believe it is us against<br>
the world.  THere is usually not that many of us, so we stick together.<br>
<p>
I must say that I do not hesitate to go to any adventist church, but I do <br>
prefer "Black" churches.  The question that Rodney King asked, "Can we<br>
all get along?" can be answered Yes if we have talks like this.  If we<br>
tell each other what we are thinking.  I  would be interested to hear from<br>
Adventists in america from the "White" churches.  I  do not wish to exclude<br>
foreigners, but I do not know if their situation is the same.  It may be.<br>

	I'm not a nutritionist, but I did read a "pro-vege" article in a<br>
weight lifting mag. (believe it or not), that warned about knowing which<br>
vitamins and minerals hinder or detract from each other when eaten<br>
together.  This is probably what is the root cause of some "difficult to<br>
absorb" irons.  There is much more to nutrition than what the average<br>
vege knows.<br>
	A curious note... is the meat and poultry industry in anyway<br>
associated with this article being written?  If so the council to eat meat<br>
would be like, and car industry encouraging us away from public<br>
transit because of it is "unsafe."<br>

[About "race" in the Seventh-day Adventist Church]<br>
<p>
I find your statement - that the Church "reflects the world" in this<br>
matter - to fit with suspicions I've had.<br>
<p>
Church members are members of, and effected by what happens outside<br>
the church walls.  So the economic difference doesn't shock me.  The silence<br>
of the Church regarding it enrages me.  By God's grace S/He helps me<br>
channel that rage so that it is constructive, and doesn't consume me.<br>
Like Sherman, I too am curious about foreigners, and their perspective.<br>
<p>
For the past year I've attend a "white" church in suburban Seattle, which is<br>
probably somewhat different from the same thing in suburban Huntsville,<br>
*Alabama* (I've visited some of those churches).  But even we aren't<br>
immune to issues of race.  At the beginning of my attendance, some people<br>
made such a show of acknowledging me, that I felt self-conscious and out of<br>
place.  I experienced others who *seemed* to be suspicious of my motives for<br>
attending there church.  There are still a few who seem to not trust me <br>
for some<br>
reason.  But there would be people in a black church who might not like me for<br>
different reasons other than race.<br>
<p>
I suspect that silence about this on SDA-net will be deafening, as in other<br>
areas of SDA-world.  Maybe "netland" will prove me wrong - - I'll welcome it.<br>

It's true that the iron in mrat is absorbed through a different<br>
mechanism than is iron from other sources.  In general, only 10% of<br>
the iron you eat is absorbed, unless you are deficient in iron, in<br>
which case the efficiency of absorption my double or even triple.<br>
Lots of factors have an impact on iron absorption -- too many to go<br>
into here.  One easy way to help enhance iron absorption from plant<br>
sources is to get enough vitamin C, which helps reduce ferric iron to<br>
the more absorbable ferrous form.<br>
<p>
Good sources of iron for vegetarians:<br>
  Prune juice -- 10.5 mg per cup!!!<br>
  Beans -- depending on the kind of bean, 5-8 mg per cup of cooked beans<br>
  Green leafy veges, fresh peas -- 2-4 mg per cup cooked<br>
  dried fruit (peaches, raisins, dates, prunes) -- 2-4 mg<br>
       from 5 peach halves, or 1/2 cup raisins, or 10 dates, or 5 prunes<br>
  Blackstrap molasses -- 3.2 mg per tablespoon<br>
<p>
Another way to up iron consumption is to cook acidic foods in cast iron<br>
cookware.<br>
If you cook spaghetti sauce in an iron pot for three hours, you increase<br>
its iron content 29 times!  You can get twice as much iron from scrambled<br>
eggs or 14 times as much from gravy that has cooked for 45 minutes in iron<br>
cookware (the eggs only have to be in the pot three minutes).<br>
<p>
Hope this helps.<br>

<p>
This was postulated from animal experiments, if i'm not wrong, and if so, i<br>
wonder at their validity in humans. Anyway, the thing they think is that<br>
iron 2+ (ferrous iron), found in haem prosthetic groups on haemoglobin and<br>
myoglobin molecules (found in blood and muscle respectively) is much more<br>
readily absorbed in the intestine, than iron 3+ (ferric iron), the more<br>
oxidised form of iron, which is the predominant form in our diet and in<br>
grains and vegetables.<br>
	In the stomach, the acid dissolves the iron and allows it to form<br>
soluble complexes with substances which reduce it to the ferrous (2+) form<br>
and keep it reduced. The most notable of these reducing agents is vitamin C,<br>
which is found in quantity only in fruits and vegetables (and not in meat).<br>
Thus, i would think that it is good to get iron from these sources. There<br>
are many other factors in iron absorbtion in the gastro-intestinal tract,<br>
but in individuals with a normal healthy GIT, iron deficiency is not really<br>
something to worry about, not in vegetarians either, although phytic acid in<br>
cereals and oxalates in some leafy vegetables bind iron in an insoluble<br>
compound and render it unavailable for absorbtion. Still, there is enough<br>
iron in a vegetarian diet. Nothing to worry about.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now I know that broccoli is supposed to be a good iron source. What</i><br>
<i>&gt;other types of food are important to maintain adequate iron intake?</i><br>
<p>
Apples turn brown because the iron 2+ (ferrous) gets oxidised to brown rust<br>
(iron 3+, ferric iron), so i guess they have quite a bit of iron. Egg yolk<br>
also has a lot of iron, but also has loads of cholesterol. Some breakfast<br>
cereal or bread manufacturers add iron to their products. Milk has iron.<br>
Leafy vegetables also have iron, but i wonder at the oxalic acid in spinnach<br>
etc. (see above) and another source also contributes to dietary iron: iron<br>
cooking utensils! Actually, iron deficiency normally results from some<br>
problem with the GIT or from bleeding (eg. ulcers) rather than a dietary<br>
deficiency, as long as we take a varied diet, and the body has a remarkable<br>
mechanism for regulating iron absorbtion to adjust to iron needs, so when<br>
more iron is needed, more is absorbed.<br>
	Even if vegetarians get less iron than "meatarians", that may not be<br>
such a bad thing, recent research has suggested that high levels of iron in<br>
the blood, are associated with most types of cancer and with heart disease,<br>
both of which are the main killers of modern urban man, so much so that some<br>
even recommend blood donation as a way to keep the body's iron stores low.<br>

Hi again,<br>
	another thing you'll hear is that vegetarians lack Vitamin B12 in<br>
their diet and so are prone to pernicious anaemia.<br>
	Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) is not produced by either plants or<br>
animals. Its sole natural source, as far as is known, is bacteria which<br>
synthesize it. Meat is thus a secondary source of the vitamin, the animals<br>
from which the meat is derived having obtained their B12 from bacterial<br>
action in their guts or on the food they eat or in the water they drink.<br>
Thus, animal products, meat, eggs, milk and particularly bivalve shellfish,<br>
are considered good sources of the vitamin, and some people say that<br>
vegetarians will thus lack B12.<br>
	However, B12 is often found in stream and well water, and on<br>
vegetables, and especially root vegetables, contaminated by soil bacteria<br>
that produce it (so it doesn't pay to be too hygenic eh?). It is also<br>
produced by symbiotic bacteria in the root nodules of legumes like peanuts<br>
or soybeans etc, which makes me wonder if peanuts are a good source ot it,<br>
them being underground and all.<br>
	In humans, it is produced in appreciable amounts in the large<br>
intestine, by bacteria that live there, but this is below the region where<br>
it can be actively absorbed (there are receptors for it in the small<br>
intestine) and so very little of it is obtained here.<br>
	However, i recently read an article in Nature magazine, which should<br>
be of interest to veggies. CMC in Vellore, India, did a survey of the<br>
intestinal flora in the small intestines of South Indians, and found at<br>
least 2 strains of bacteria there (Pseudomonas and Kleisignella... i think i<br>
spelt that wrong) which produced Vitamin B12 or B12-like substances, and<br>
suggested that that was why B12 deficiency was rare, even among vegetarians,<br>
in South India; whereas is was more common amongst South Indian vegetarians<br>
who migrated to Western countries, although their diet was the same, because<br>
standards of hygene are such that their intestinal flora becomes<br>
impovrished.<br>

I recently read in Vol 108, No3 of the Australian Edition of Signs of the<br>
Times, that there are Sabbath-keeping and only-clean-food eating groups of<br>
Christians and Jews in the Ethiopean countryside, and the article explains<br>
that they are probably SDAs who went underground out in the countryside and<br>
so survived Mengistu's Red Terror of the 1970s. However, i seem to remember<br>
reading in the Great Controversy and in one of those apologetical books<br>
about the Sabbath, that these are in fact, indiginous Sabbath Keepers of<br>
Pre-SDA origin, who kept the Sabbath freely until Musolinni invaded Ethiopea<br>
or something like that. Can anyone shed light on this?<br>

Hi Steven,<br>
Distribute this article, if u think it's worthwhile.<br>
<p>
This is an article that I took from an interview between a SDA Elder<br>
(Elder J.F. Ballenger) and a Professor from RCC.<br>
<p>
<p>
========================================================================<br>
<p>
PROFESSOR. - Now, Elder, do you really think that there will be another perse<br>
cution for conscience' sake, and that, too, for refusing to keep the Sunday?<br>
ELDER. - If I did not, Professor, I certainly would  no preach it.<br>
PROFESSOR. - Indeed, Elder, I do not doubt your sincerity for a moment; I think<br>
you nonestly believe what you preach, but may it not be true that you put a<br>
wrong interpreation upon the profecy? It seems impossible that with the history<br>
of the Dark Ages before us, the pages fo histroy could ever again be stained<br>
with the cruel  persecution.<br>
ELDER. - Indeed it does seem strange that history  should repeat  itself that<br>
way, but human nature is the same  in all ages, and when the conditions are<br>
equal, the results will be the same.<br>
PROFESSOR. - Yes, that is true; and I am aware that since the Reformation ofthe<br>
sixteenth century, persecution has raised its hydra head at times, and that,too<br>
by those calling themselves Protestants. But we had hoped that with the advan-<br>
cing light upon religious liberty of the nineteenth century such a thing could<br>
never be repeated.<br>
ELDER. - As to being mistaken in regard to the interpretation of the prophecy,<br>
you will admit that if we have no infallible guide by which to apply the pro-<br>
phecy it would be of no more use to us than the heathen auguries. But if we can<br>
be positive that we have the right application, then there can be no doubt in<br>
regard to the results.<br>
PROFESSOR. - That is the great question. Elder, if you can show beyond the pos-<br>
sibility of doubt that you are right in your application of the prophecy, then<br>
we need not be in doubt in regard the results.<br>
ELDER. - You will agree with me that the leopard beast of the Revelations 13 &amp;<br>
14 is a symbol of the papacy?<br>
PROFESSOR. - Yes; I agree with you that that beast is a symbol of the Roman<br>
Catholic Church. I do not think it possible to apply it to anything else. But<br>
thath the Sunday institution is th mark, os sign, of the papacy I am not so<br>
sure.<br>
ELDER. - Why are you so sure that the leopard beast is a symbol of papacy?<br>
PROFESSOR. - All Protestant commentators of any note that I have read apply the<br>
symbol to the papacy; but  even if we had no such testimony any one who has<br>
read the history of that Church cannot fail to see that it has fulfilled every<br>
specification of the symbol.<br>
ELDER. - Exactly; then  the events that fulfill the prophecy in every particu-<br>
lar are infallible guides to its interpretation.<br>
PROFESSOR. - Yes; when the events described in the prophecy come to pass, it<br>
would be foolish to deny the application; but where are the events that have<br>
taken place to prove that the Sunday is the mark of the papacy?<br>
ELDER. - You were present in the tent when we read the testimony from both<br>
Catholic and Protestant historians that the governors of the Church, in conec-<br>
tion with the emperors, transferred the rest from the Seventh to the First day<br>
of the week?<br>
PROFESSOR. - Yes. I am quite well convinced that the bishops of Rome  changed<br>
the Sabbath, and I am also convinced that there is no Scriptural authority for<br>
the change.<br>
ELDER. - Then if the Catholic Church changed the Sabbath, and the Protestant<br>
world accept the change, would not that be a sign that they, the Catholics, had<br>
the power to change GOD's times and the law? See Dan. 7:25<br>
PROFESSOR. - I suppose it would<br>
ELDER. - But do you not know that it would?<br>
PROFESSOR. - Yes; of course, if we acknowledge that the Church changed the<br>
Sabbath, and we accept the change, then we must acknowledge that the change it<br>
self is an evidence that they had power to make it.<br>
ELDER. - You acknowledge that they made the change. Now if you keep Sunday, do<br>
you not confess by your own conduct that the Sunday-keeping is a mark of their<br>
power to make the change?<br>
PROFESSOR. - Well, I had no looked at it just in that light before, yet I must<br>
confess that it is a pretty strong argument against us.<br>
ELLLDER. - Again: if the leaders of the Catholic Church confess that tehy made<br>
the  the change, and set it before all athe world as a mark of their power to<br>
legislate in matters of religion, would you dare stand up and say that the<br>
Catholic leaders do not know themselves what the mark of their power is? To<br>
ilustrate, suppose a man did not know what the mark or sign of the MASONIC<br>
order was, and on inquirey he found thath all the leaders of the fraternity<br>
declared that the square and the compass was a sign of their order; would he,<br>
or any one, be so presumptuous as to contradict them, and declare that they<br>
themselves did not know what their sign was?<br>
PROFESSOR. - O, no; of course no person would be so foolish as to do that.<br>
ELDER. - Very well; then if you admit that the Catholic Church changed the<br>
Sabbath, and you keep the day that they have substituted in place of GOD's<br>
Sabbath, and by so doing you acknowlodge their power to make the change,then<br>
when they  set forth the change as a mark, or sign, of hteir power to change<br>
GOD's law, how in the world can you deny their claim to the change as mark of<br>
their power to do the very thing that you admit they did do?<br>
PROFESSOR. - Are you sure that the Catholic leaders publish to the world the<br>
change of the Sabbath as a mark of their power to make the change?<br>
ELDER. - Listen to the answer of Cardinal Gibbons to the question asked by<br>
Mr. J. F. Snyder, of Bloomington, Ill., if the Catholic Church held the<br>
change of the Sabbath as a markof their power to make the change, to which the<br>
Cardinal gave the following reply: "Of course the Catholic Church claims that<br>
the change was her act. It could not have been otherwise, as none in those days<br>
 would have dreamed of doing anything in matters spiritua and religious without<br>
her, and the act is a mark of her ecclesiastical power and authority in reli-<br>
gious matters.<br>
"Yours respectfully,<br>
       "Wm. Rewday,<br>
"Sec. for the Cardinal."<br>
<p>
Could anything be more plain and to the point than this acknowledmente on the<br>
part of this noted Catholic official? Do you not think that the Cardinal knows<br>
what the Catholic Church holds as a mark of her power to legislate in matters<br>
of religion?<br>
PROFESSOR. - When you men make a statement, you generally have the documents at<br>
hand to back it up; but I tell you it places  Sunday-keepers in a box.<br>
If you are right (and we must admit that the evidence is very conclusive), then<br>
it means to stand up against the ire of the Beast or drink the unmingled wrath<br>
of GOD.<br>
ELDER. - That is just what it does mean; and when you consider the fact that<br>
more than one hundred of you pople in the United States and Canada have benn ar<br>
rested, fined, and imprisioned, and in some instance worked in the chain-gang<br>
with common criminals, and that, too. in the face of the fact that good citizen<br>
not of our faith have testified that it was persecution pure and simple, and<br>
nothing else, it sets an infallible seal to our interpretation of the prophecy,<br>
and it ought not to take long for you and every other professed Christian to<br>
decide what to do.<br>
PROFESSOR. - That is so, Elder. My work demands that I must bid you good-by<br>
for the present, but I wish to hoave another talk with you on this subject.<br>
ELDER. - All righ; come over to the tent any time, and we shall be glad to<br>
give you any information we can on this question.<br>

OK, it seems like I need to rephrase part of my original post, where I <br>
asked for people's summaries of how they think an SDA should differ from,<br>
say, a Seventh-day Baptist.<br>
<p>
I said something like "Don't get me wrong, I am the last person to say<br>
we should dwell on our distinctives."<br>
<p>
Instead, read "Don't get me wrong, I think there are many other aspects<br>
of being an SDA which are at least of equal importance as the things that<br>
distinguish us from other Christians. I am the last person to say we<br>
should concentrate mainly on our distinctives, when it seems many today lack<br>
even the basics of Christianity. Besides, the reason for this post is<br>
to assist me in establishing what others believe those distinguishing<br>
factors to be, rather than to discuss how much preaching and<br>
evangelizing should be done about them."<br>

It is difficult to know what kind of Sabbath-keepers in Ethiopia were<br>
referred to in the magazine.  Two items of interest:  The seventh-day<br>
Sabbath was kept in Ethiopia as a regular day of rest until the 16th<br>
century.  Conflict with Roman Catholics changed the custom.<br>
Saturday is considered the appropriate day of worship, with Coptic <br>
meetings taking place in the afternoon.  However, Sunday is also a<br>
day to worship.  This is what we observed on a brief visit there in<br>
1989.<br>
On the historical aspect of Sabbath in Ethiopia, see the chapter in<br>
Sabbath in Scripture and History.<br>

Hi,<br>
"Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with<br>
regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a SABBATH DAY."<br>
	- Col 2:16<br>
<p>
This text is has been used by many sunday keeping church pastors to <br>
keep their people from becoming an adventist.  And when a person gets <br>
sabbath message they always question with this one.<br>
Any one have good answers for this one?<br>

We who live in Southern California now know no majority culture.  We<br>
are all minorities searching for a way to create the New Testament<br>
church when we are buffeted from and about the multitude of cultures<br>
and races around us.  I believe that in time all of the United States<br>
will have to come to the realization that there is no majority race<br>
(culture), and I we hope that those of us who've gotten to that point<br>
early will have a model or multiple models of how to live together and<br>
to achieve our true vocation -- advancing the gospel.  Indeed, if<br>
we do offer models we will have advanced the gospel.<br>
<p>
My home church, Alhambra, CA, is classified by the conference as an<br>
Anglo (white) church, but some members' skins reflect a great deal of<br>
the ambiant light and others absorb most of it.  There are those<br>
who speak English as their first language, adn thos who speak Talagu,<br>
Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, Mandrin, Romanian, Japanese, and<br>
some other European languages I'm sure I've omitted.  We get along<br>
together marvelously for we have a truly inclusive body of believers.<br>
We cherish our diversity while striving for the same goals.  We are<br>
working now to make sure that we are also sensitive to age-inclusiveness<br>
as well as race (culture) and gender.  We've been idea tolerant for<br>
decades.  <br>

Here's something I posted to another group a while back.<br>
<p>
Bottom line summary might be:<br>
<p>
	- men often get too much iron<br>
<p>
	- women often don't get enough (I've heard reports of 25%<br>
	rates of deficiency for women), partly because of greater<br>
	losses and partly because they tend to eat lighter foods like<br>
	salads<br>
<p>
	- just because a plant diet was right in the Garden of Eden<br>
	(and still right in my view) doesn't automatically mean that<br>
	one can get enough iron from plant foods;  it's rare, for<br>
	example, for someone with bad eyes to refuse glasses with the<br>
	argument that "it's not natural" or "they didn't wear glasses<br>
	in the Garden of Eden"<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; I read yesterday that iron can be better assimilated from plant</i><br>
<i>&gt; sources if more vitamin C is consumed at the same time.  So, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; suppose iron from plants is better assimilated if it is eaten</i><br>
<i>&gt; fresh and with other fresh vegetables?!</i><br>
<p>
I have my copy of the 1980 "Recommended Dietary Allowances" handy and<br>
thought I would summarize more completely what it says about iron.  As<br>
far as I know nothing has changed in the last 10 years.<br>
<p>
1.  Anemia is not necessarily a very sensitive indicator of iron<br>
depletion, because iron is stored in the body and the stores are<br>
depleted before the hemoglobin concentration begins to drop.<br>
<p>
2.  Iron metabolism is not regulated by increased or decreased<br>
excretion, as is the the case for other minerals.<br>
<p>
3.  The average iron loss in the healthy adult male is about 1.0mg a<br>
day.<br>
<p>
4.  For adult females, there is an additional loss of 0.5mg a day, the<br>
amount of iron in the menstrual blood flow averaged over a month.<br>
<p>
5.  There is wide variation in #4, and about 5% of females have been<br>
observed to lose over 1.4mg a day, making the total loss 2.4mg a day.<br>
<p>
6.  Pregnancy increases the requirement to 3.5mg a day.<br>
<p>
7.  Children and adolescents need about 1.8mg a day.<br>
<p>
8.  Intestinal absorption is regulated in a way that tends to keep<br>
body iron constant.  In the event of iron deficiency, the rate of<br>
absorption increases by a factor of 2-3, but this is not necessarily<br>
sufficient to prevent anemia.<br>
<p>
9.  The above requirements are combined with an estimated 10%<br>
availability of food iron to get the recommended daily allowances.<br>
So, for example, an adult female may excrete 1.5-2.4mg per day,<br>
meaning that she needs 15-24mg of iron in the diet.<br>
<p>
10. A more precise estimate of iron availability in food can be<br>
obtained by considering "heme" and "nonheme" iron.  All iron from<br>
vegetable sources is nonheme, while 40% of iron from animal sources is<br>
heme and 60% nonheme.<br>
<p>
11. Given the types of iron, availability can be calculated as<br>
follows:<br>
<p>
        type of meal            nonheme absorption      heme absorption<br>
        ------------            ------------------      ---------------<br>
<p>
        &lt;30g meat                       3                       23<br>
        &lt;25mg vitamin C<br>
<p>
        30-90g meat                     5                       23<br>
        or 25-75mg vitamin C<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;90g meat                       8                       23</i><br>
        or &gt;75mg vitamin C<br>
        or 30-90g meat<br>
        plus 25-75mg vitamin C<br>
<p>
12. Various dietary and medicinal substances decrease iron absorption,<br>
such as calcium and phosphate salts, phytates, tannic acid in tea, and<br>
antacids.<br>

Actually another good source of B12 is soy sauce.  Even though it may be<br>

replace your MSG or normal table salt with it, it's not so bad a trade.<br>

	WILL THE REAL GOSPEL PLEASE STAND UP?<br>
			by<br>
		Dennis Priebe<br>
<p>
The past several years have been a time of real pain for Seventh-<br>
day Adventists. We were not around at the last time of major crisis<br>
in Adventist history during the early 1900's. We have all seen pastors<br>
leave the ministry before for various reasons, including an occasional<br>
pastor who felt that Seventh-day Adventist beliefs were not compatible<br>
with his own beliefs; but now we are seeing young, briaht, conscientious<br>
pastors saying, "I can no longer preach Adventism and be true to my<br>
conscience and the Bible." Some church members have felt that they<br>
were hearing a different brand of Adventism proclaimed from a Seventh-<br>
day Adventist pulpit, one which they felt to be totally incompatible<br>
with the Seventh-day Adventist mission and message. What is going on<br>
in our beloved church? Ministers and laymen have become confused.<br>
Desperate cries have gone out from both sides, attacking the other<br>
position, while those in the middle wonder how they can possibly make<br>
a decision about who is right, or whether they should just silently<br>
slip out the back door of Adventism. Is there any answer, or are we<br>
doomed to stumble along while our church crumbles beneath us?<br>
<p>
I am convinced that there is a reason for the pain we are suffering<br>
today, and that there is a solution to our theological dilemma. We have<br>
been told that our church must be judged by the gospel. I accept that<br>
challenge. The gospel lies at the heart of Christianity, and without<br>
the gospel there would be no point nor purpose in Sabbathkeeping. But<br>
what is the gospel? This is the critical question which has been pound-<br>
ing at the consciousness of pastors, teachers, and laymen.<br>
<p>
I am going to propose that there are two versions of the gospel<br>
being proclaimed within Adventism. I am going to outline them from<br>
presuppositions to conclusions, with the hope that doing so will explain<br>
why some men and women are having a crisis of conscience with Seventh-<br>
day Adventis~ teaching. Of course I will specify which gospel I believe<br>
to be in harmony with the Bible and Adventism, but perhaps the greatest<br>
good to come from what I am about to say will be the clarification of<br>
the opposing positions, so that you will be better prepared, individually,<br>
to study the Bible and our modern inspired testimony to determine which<br>
of the two systems of belief will be your gospel. For ultimately, it<br>
must come to that--you must make a decision based on Bible study and<br>
prayer.<br>
<p>
You see, in the past it has been relatively easy to identify the<br>
"offshoot" groups and stay within the mainstream of Adventism. Not<br>
many have followed the voices of the Shepherd's Rod or the Reformed<br>
Adventists. But now we have two gospels within the mainstream of<br>
Adventism, which makes the choice much more difficult. This has been<br>
developing for the past thirty years within Adventism, and I submit that<br>
the eYents of the late 70's are the inevitable and natural result of<br>
the seeds planted many years ago. What we once thought to be one track<br>
of truth stretching out before us has been seen only lately as two tracks,<br>
diverging more and more widely until we have found ourselves at this<br>
crisis point. At the heart of my proposal to you is the deep conviction<br>
that these two tracks are totally incompatible with each other, that<br>
compromise or harmony between them is logically impossible, and that one<br>
must make a choice between the two systems. Then let us look at these<br>
rlval claimants to the title "gospel" with the hope that the real gospel<br>
will be able to stand up confidently.<br>
<p>
STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br>
<p>
A recent article was titled "Exodus From Adventism," in which was<br>
compiled a list of 100 Seventh-day Adventist ministers and teachers who<br>
left Adventism for reasons of conscience. In the article was this com-<br>
ment: "The denomination would give the appearance that it is frantically<br>
attempting to rid itself of the unwelcome doctrines of salvation by faith<br>
alone and the all-sufficiency of Scripture as the sole doctrinal norm."<br>
(Sharon Herbey, "Exodus From Adventism," Evangelica, Feb. 1982, p. 23)<br>
Now those are broad charges. Is it possible to be more specific about<br>
just what is meant here?<br>
<p>
In South Africa, Francis Campbell attempted to pinpoint the specific<br>
areas of controversy in these words: "The denomination has never been<br>
able to define clearly its position on the nature of Christ, perfection,<br>
original sin--areas which are vital to an unoerstanding of righteousness<br>
by faith. As a result various streams of theology exist within the<br>
church, leaving our members in a state of confusion." (Ibid.) I believe<br>
that his insights were extremely accurate and get right to the heart of<br>
the difficulties we are experiencing. For I agree that as a church we<br>
have never defined clearly our beliefs in these three critical areas--<br>
sin, Christ, and perfection; and because of our unclarity and divergent<br>
views in these areas, we have been wandering in the theological desert<br>
for these past 40 years of uncertainty and frustration. Because we<br>
have held contradictory views in these areas, we have been unable to<br>
clearly define our message and our mission.<br>
<p>
The following lines were written by Aage Rendalen, who once served<br>
as a Seventh-day Adventist editor in Norway. "In the 1g50's Adventism<br>
began a remarkable house cleaning. A number of doctrines which had<br>
bothered theological purists for years were given a public funeral.<br>
Wi~h the rising level of biblical knowled~e in the church, as well as<br>
increasing contact with evangelical theologians, many leading Adventists<br>
felt embarrassed about some of the doctrines that had survived the nine-<br>
teenth century. Chief among these were the doctrines of the split<br>
atonement and the sinful nature of Christ. With the publication of the<br>
book Questions on Doctrine in 1957, both views were repudiated. The work<br>
of clarification progressed up to the beginning of the 1970's. By then<br>
the traditional belief in a latter day perfection had come under attack<br>
and seemed to be on the way out. . . . In spite of frantic efforts by<br>
a few vocal defenders of Adventist tradition, the doctrines of the sinful<br>
nature of Christ and human perfectibility in this world were slowly<br>
slnking. The weight of biblical evidence had simply overcome what little<br>
bouyancy was left. With the dawning of the eighties a new crisis of<br>
unsurpassed magnitude is now confronting the church. What is thought<br>
to be the very foundation of Adventism--our 'sanctuary theology'--is<br>
coming under close examination. At the same time the authority of<br>
Mrs. White as a crypto-canonical prophet is being re-evaluated. With<br>
the evangelical courtship of the 1950's the Adventist leaders started<br>
something the extent of which they did not anticipate. The traditional<br>
Adventist landscape was being radically changed, and as a result a<br>
crisis of identity set in. Today, the very validity of the movement<br>
has become an open question to many. They feel that this is not the<br>
church they joined. The doctrinal superiority . . . which the evange-<br>
list had held out to them now appears to lie in shambles. Can this<br>
really be 'the only true church'? they ask." (Aage Rendalen, "Adventism:<br>
Has the Medium Become the Message?" Evangelica, Dec. 1980, p. 35)<br>
<p>
As I read his article, I got the feeling that, from a quite dif-<br>
ferent perspective, he was stating what I want to state, for he has<br>
pinpointed the issues at stake in the controversy and the historical<br>
development of these issues over the past 30 years. He has, in fact,<br>
hit the nail right on the head. These are the issues which need to<br>
be defined if there is any hope that the real gospel will ever stand<br>
up. I would like to repeat one terribly important sentence in his arti-<br>
cle. "With the evangelical courtship of the 1950's the Adventist leaders<br>
started something the extent of which they did not anticipate. The tra-<br>
ditional Adventist landscape was being radically changed." How very,<br>
very true. Of special note is the book of those years which was seen<br>
to be extremely influential in changing the Adventist landscape.<br>
<p>
I have come to believe that the things which we have seen in the<br>
late 70's and early 80's are but the inevitable harvest of the seeds<br>
planted during the 50's and 60's. These theological seeds have matured<br>
into a consistent and logical theological harvest. What I am saying is<br>
that, given the presuppositions, the conclusions are necessary, even<br>
inevitable, and many thinking Adventists have seen the necessity of<br>
living out the implications of those conclusions. Moreover, both the<br>
presuppositions and the conclusions are widely believed within the<br>
Seventh-day Adventist Church right now by a wide range of scholars,<br>
ministers~ and laymen. Thus it is not iust a matter of beliefs outside<br>
of Adventism versus those within Adventism. Both systems of theological<br>
belief are alive and growing in the Seventh-day Adventist Church today.<br>
Now let us look more specifically at the individual components of these<br>
systems of belief.<br>
<p>
THE CENTRAL ISSUE<br>
<p>
The pivotal issue which determines the direction of both systems of<br>
belief--the foundation and premise of the whole controversy--is the<br>
question, What is sin? You see, the gospel is all about how we are saved<br>
from sin. It is sin which has caused us to be lost, and the gospel is<br>
the good news of how God redeems us from sin. Now most of us have<br>
assumed for perhaps our whole lifetime that we know what sin is, but as<br>
is typically true for most things that we assume without examining them<br>
carefully, our assumptions may be just that, unproved assumptions that<br>
need careful rethinking. It is just at this point that Adventism has<br>
been challenged as having unclear and even erroneous definitions of sin<br>
which have led to erroneous positions in righteousness by faith.<br>
<p>
The vital question is, What is the nature of sin for which man is<br>
considered guilty, so guilty that he must die in the fires of hell unless<br>
he is rescued by the grace of God? We must be precise in defining the<br>
nature of this sin, so that we will know just what it is that the gospel<br>
rescues us from. Of what must we be forgiven? What must be healed for<br>
us to escape eternal death? When you go to see d doctor, he must first<br>
determine precisely the nature of the problem afflicting you before he<br>
can prescribe a therapy or medicine which can heal you. Just so with<br>
sin. We must know wherein our guilt lies, so that we will be able to<br>
apply the gospel to the correct illness.<br>
<p>
	THE GOSPEL AS DEFINED IN "NEW" OR "REFORMATION" THEOLOGY<br>
<p>
			THE NATURE OF SIN<br>
<p>
In Geoffrey Paxton's challenging book, The Shaking of Adventism,<br>
he says that we rejected righteousness by fa~h in 1888 because we<br>
rejected the historic doctrine of original sin. He identifies original<br>
sin as the foundational principle of Reformation theology. (pp. 98-114)<br>
Now original sin is simply the belief that we are guilty because of our<br>
birth as sons and daughters of Adam. We are guilty by nature, before<br>
any choice of good or evil can enter the picture. Our condemnation<br>
comes from Adam; we are guilty because of our inherited depravity.<br>
"There is sin in the desire of sin." "Sin is declared to exist in the<br>
being prior to our own consciousness of it." "There is guilt in evil<br>
desires, even when resisted by the will." (Desmond Ford, "The Relation-<br>
ship Between the Incarnation and Righteousness by Faith," in Documents<br>
 From the Palmdale Conference On Riqhteousness bY Faith, p. 28)<br>
<p>
Thus sin and guilt apply to nature, and the gospel must deal with<br>
the reality of guilt as a part of the nature of man which can never be<br>
removed until eternal life. In this view, weakness, imperfection, and<br>
tendencies are sin. It is an interesting and significant point that<br>
the Reformers built their doctrine of original sin on the premise of<br>
predestination, which teaches that ~od leaves some men to suffer and die<br>
in their sinful and guilty natures while He elects to send His saving<br>
grace to others through the gospel. These two doctrines fit together<br>
very naturally, so it is a bit strange that while predestination has been<br>
rejected by most Christians today, original sin is still seen as the<br>
foundation of correct gospel teaching.<br>
<p>
			THE NATURE OF CHRIST<br>
<p>
Now to the next step. What kind of human being must Christ be, if<br>
He is going to be both human and sinless? Obviously He must have a sin-<br>
less nature, totally unlike the nature you and I inherit from birth.<br>
Sometimes this is referred to as the nature of Adam before the fall.<br>
Again some quoted statements will help to clarify. "For Christ to be<br>
the second or last Adam, He . . . must possess a sinless human nature."<br>
"To teach that Christ was possessed of sinful propensities is to teach<br>
that He Himself was a sinner in need of a Saviour." (Ibid., p. 32)<br>
<p>
Because of the belief that sinful nature involves guilt in the<br>
sight of God, it is absolutely imperative that Christ have no connection<br>
with our sinful nature. If one is to ask how this could be, since Christ<br>
did have a human mother, this is one answer. "The substance of Mary<br>
was moulded into d perfect nature for our Lord just as in the beginning<br>
the Holy Spirit took chaos and made a perfect world." (Ibid., p. 34) In<br>
other words, Mary's genetic deficiencies were altered so that she would<br>
pass on only a perfect heredity to Christ, completely unlike the heredity<br>
we receive from our parents.<br>
<p>
			JUSTIFICATION<br>
<p>
The next step involves our experience. Since we are guilty by nature, and <br>
since we will retain this nature until glorification, and since<br>
we continue to be guilty after our conversion, and since we sin even in<br>
the good deeds we do (because there is probably some selfishness tainting<br>
our best efforts, and, even in the very act of overcoming sin we may be<br>
guilty), therefore we must focus on justification rather than sanctifica-<br>
tion. We must look to an imputed righteousness outside of us at all<br>
times, since whatever is within us is corrupted by guilt.<br>
<p>
Thus the gospel is justification, the righteousness of Christ<br>
credited to our account. Righteousness by faith is always justification<br>
only, while sanctification is basically good advice. This must be so,<br>
since anything which is corrupted with original sin can never participate<br>
in a perfect righteousness by faith. Thus we are forensically, legally<br>
righteous, while we are actually inwardly guilty at all times. We must<br>
always emphasize Christ's work for us rather than the Holy Spirit's<br>
work in us.<br>
<p>
			PERFECTION<br>
<p>
Finally, the basic premise of sin as nature leads to an inevitable<br>
conclusion regarding perfection of character. If our essential guilt<br>
resides in our nature, the nature with which we were born, and if we<br>
retain this nature until death or translation, then it becomes patently<br>
clear that there can be no talk of perfection or sinlessness in this<br>
life. If, in spite of growing spiritually during a lifetime of trusting<br>
Jesus more and relying less on our own efforts, we are iust as guilty<br>
at age 60 as we were at age 18, then the words character perfection are<br>
really meaningless and ought to be dropped quickly from our spiritual<br>
vocabulary. Thus the repudiation of the possibility of moral perfection<br>
in this life is a necessary corollary to the doctrine of original sin.<br>
The very effort to attain perfection results in legalism and a denial<br>
of righteousness by faith. Even after the close of probation the char-<br>
acters of God's people will be defective in faith, hope, and love.<br>
Since the only meaning of sinlessness is a totally sinless nature, that<br>
will never happen until glorification.<br>
<p>
			CONCLUSION<br>
<p>
This, then, is the gospel according to one well-developed and<br>
carefully articulated system of belief both within and outside Advent-<br>
ism. It is consistent from its presuppositions to its conclusions, and<br>
I believe that if you begin with the foundational premises of this<br>
system, you must logically end with its conclusions. I believe that<br>
this ls one reason it has become so attractive to many long-time Advent-<br>
ists. Then, if we desire to be logical and Biblical, are we forced to<br>
join in this understanding of the gospel, with the only other option<br>
being both illogical and unbiblical?<br>
<p>
I believe that the true gospel, the gospel of Jesus Christ and<br>
Paul, is based on different presuppositions and leads to different<br>
conclusions. I believe that this gospel is the only one which deals<br>
adequately with the great cosmic issues in the controversy between God<br>
and Satan. I believe that this is the only gospel which will provide<br>
security and hope for the Seventh-day Adventist Church and for individu-<br>
als asking the age-old question, "What must I do to inherit eternal<br>
life?" Following, then, is a short summary of the other option, the<br>
other way of understanding the gospel promised in the Old Testament<br>
and realized in the New Testament.<br>
<p>
		THE GOSPEL AS DEFINED IN ADVENTISM<br>
<p>
The basic presupposition of this gospel is that the heart of the<br>
cosmic controversy between God and Satan revolves around the issue of<br>
free choice. God took terrible risks with the universe to protect<br>
freedom of choice. Why did God allow the misery of sin? Because of<br>
the worthlessness of forced obedience and the necessity of the pos-<br>
sibility to sin if righteousness was to be possible. Jesus came to<br>
this earth to ~e killed by Satan to allow all men to choose freely<br>
once aqain. And the aqonY of sin will not end until Catan freel~,/ hnw<br>
down and confesses Jesus' Lordship. This means that the greatest<br>
tragedy of the universe is Satan's maligning of God, a tragedy even<br>
greater than my sins. Thus the issue to be resolved i5 how unfallen<br>
beings, angels and fallen beings will choose in the great controversy,<br>
either for God or for Satan. All of this means that the gospel can<br>
never be based on predestination of any kind, which essentially bypasses<br>
any right of man to choose for or against God. The gospel is built<br>
solidly on the foundation of free choice--the two most important words<br>
in the history and in the future of the universe.<br>
<p>
			THE NATURE OF SIN<br>
<p>
This leads to a decision about the nature of sin. Sin is not<br>
basically the way man is, but the way man chooses. Sin is when the<br>
mind conSehtS to what seems desirable and thus breaks its relationship<br>
with God. To talk of guilt in terms of inherited nature is to overlook<br>
the important category of responsibility. Not until we have joined our<br>
own will to mankind's rebellion against God, not until we have actively<br>
entered into opposition to the will of God, does guilt enter in. Sin is<br>
concerned with a man's life, his rebellion against God, his wilful dis-<br>
obedience, and the distorted relationship with ~od which ensues. Sin is<br>
concerned with a man's will rather than his nature. If responsibility<br>
for sin is to have any meaning, it cannct also be affirmed that fallen<br>
human nature makes man inevitably guilty of sin. Inevitability and<br>
responsibility are mutually exclusive concepts in the moral sphere. Thus<br>
sin is defined as choosing wilfully to rebel against God in thought, word,<br>
or action. In this gospel sin is our wilful choice to exercise our fall-<br>
en, sinful nature in opposition to God's will.<br>
<p>
			THE NATURE OF CHRIST<br>
<p>
Building on this foundation, we move to the nature of Christ. If<br>
sin is not nature but choice, then Christ could inherit our fallen,<br>
sinful nature without thereby becoming a sinner. He remained ever sin-<br>
less because His conscious choice was always obedience to God, never<br>
allowing His inherited nature to control His choices. His inheritance<br>
was just the same as our inheritance, with no need to resort to special<br>
intervention by God to prevent Jesus from receiving human sinfulness<br>
from Mary.<br>
<p>
Christ accepted voluntarily the humiliation of descending, not only<br>
to the level of unfallen man, but to the level to which man had fallen<br>
through the sin of Adam and the sins of succeeding generations. Man was<br>
not in the state of Adam before the fall, so something far more drastic<br>
was needed if the effects of Adam's fall were to be overcome. Christ<br>
must descend to the depths to which mankind had fallen and in His own<br>
person lift mankind from its fallen depths to a new level of life. Jesus<br>
stooped from the very heights to the very depths to lift us up, to be our<br>
Saviour. If Jesus had assumed a perfect human nature untouched by the<br>
fall, then He would not have stood side by side with man in his need. If<br>
Jesus had assumed unfallen human nature, there would have been a great gulf<br>
created by sin. It was fallen humanity that He was to represent before ~od.<br>
He stood at the side of fallen sinners to mediate between sinful man and<br>
a holy God.<br>
<p>
If Jesus assumed perfect human nature, He spanned the gulf between God<br>
and man, but the gulf between fallen and unfallen man still needed to be<br>
bridged. If, however, Christ shared our fallen, sinful nature, then His<br>
mediatorial work bridges the whole gulf from fallen man in his dire need to<br>
God. Only by entering into our situation in the deepest and fullest sense<br>
and identifying Himself fully with us was He able to be our Saviour. Any<br>
other conditicn except in sinful flesh would have been challenged at once<br>
by the enemy, and would have influenced the thinking of the universe.<br>
<p>
It is at least of interest to note that this understanding of Christ<br>
was the one believed strongly by Jones and Waggoner in their righteousness<br>
by faith messages of 1888, which were endorsed so highly by Ellen White.<br>
In fact, this understanding of Christ's life was the accenting power of<br>
their messages; the Lord Jesus Christ, who was loyal to God in sinful flesh.<br>
<p>
 From here the gospel message moves to our situation. The gospel is<br>
the good news about God's character, that God both forgives and restores.<br>
The gospel is both God's declaration that we stand righteous in the merits<br>
of Christ and ~od's renovation of our sinful lives so that, gradually, we<br>
may be restored into His image. The gospel is both a legal verdict and<br>
transforming power. Union with Christ is the key to the faith through<br>
which justification must take place. The gospel includes justification--<br>
a uniting with Christ by faith~on the basis of which we are declared<br>
righteous; and sanctification--a growing more like Christ through the<br>
daily exercise of a constantly growing faith~ on the basis of which we are<br>
made righteous.<br>
<p>
			PERFECTION<br>
<p>
Finally, this gospel can speak comfortably and Biblically about<br>
Christian perfection, which is simply letting God do His full work in us<br>
as we depend ever more fully upon Him by trusting faith. This is not<br>
extremism in perfection. It is not trying to be good enough to please<br>
God and to be saved; it is not removal of our sinful nature; it is not<br>
dependence on our internal goodness.<br>
<p>
Perfection is total victory over sin, when through total trust in<br>
Christ's power sin becomes repulsive and we have no desire to transgress<br>
God's will. If sin is our wilful choice to rebel against God in thought,<br>
word, or action, then sinlessness is our wilful choice not to rebel<br>
against God in thought, word, or-action. The purpose of perfection is<br>
not to save us, but to honor Christ. It is not the eradication of our<br>
sinful nature, but the subjection of that nature through a relationship<br>
with Christ. It is not a plateau, but unceasing growth and teachableness.<br>
It is not awareness of our inward holiness, but dependence on Christ. It<br>
is not being free of temptation, but refusing to yield to temptation. It<br>
is not autonomous goodness, but total dependence so that we are all through<br>
rebelling.<br>
<p>
This gospel affirms that it is possible to have a sinless character<br>
in a sinful nature. Perfection remains always the goal, while abiding<br>
in Christ is the method. Thus my concern is not primarily with the end<br>
product, but with my relationship with and my trust in Christ today.<br>
Only with this understanding of Chr~stian perfection of character does<br>
the Seventh-d~y Adventist message of the second coming carry motivating<br>
power. This understanding demands agonizing with God in prayer. Do we<br>
know what it means to wrestle with God as did Jacob? Are our souls<br>
drawn out after God with intensity of desire until every power is on the<br>
stretch? Do we cling with unyielding faith to the promises of God?<br>
<p>
			CONCLUSION<br>
<p>
These, then, are the two gospels being proposed within Adventism.<br>
Do you see why these two systems are incompatible with each other? Do<br>
you see that compromise between them is impossible; that you must make<br>
a choice for your personal faith? I challenge you to study and pray<br>
for yourselves, so that you will know what you believe and why, rightly<br>
dividing the word of truth. May informed and Spirit-guided decisions<br>
be made that will stand up under the pressures of the last days, and<br>
more importantly, under the scrutinizing eye of God as He probes our<br>
consciences to see if we have made honest decisions or if we have<br>
rationalized and equivocated, seeking the easier way May the good<br>
news be God's good news and not man's invention.<br>

<p>
Many things were special, He had no propensities to sin ( ie habitual)<br>
He had never been separate from His Father we often are.<br>
He was God, He could not have been God had He been born from a union<br>
of man and woman, then He would have been only man and not the Son of God.<br>
He was guiltless. etc ?<br>

Sorry to strum this chord again, especially to those who would<br>
much rather I wouldn't. However some of you are interested in this<br>
material so I will post it. Those of you not interested should just skip<br>
this message and ignore it.<br>
<p>
Following are some verses which if accepted as truth strike directly against<br>
the Adventist position, because they are key texts. I am not suggesting <br>
that the SDA position relies solely on "island texts" for support but<br>
obscuring the clearly obvious texts doesn't help.  <br>
<p>
The question is, how would you answer someone who came with a different version <br>
regarding these key doctrines ? And after having explained these translations<br>
away, how would you then handle the assertion that the bible was contradictory,<br>
or unreliable in the light of the twisting and summersalting necessary to<br>
straighten out these distorted texts ?<br>
<p>
Even though I am only comparing the NIV to the KJV, I do it because the NIV<br>
is representative of just about if not all modern translations and in fact<br>
it is also fairly representative of the Catholic Reims version and the Jesuit <br>
bible of 1582. I could just about as well included the ASV or RSV or you name<br>
it instead of the NIV, just that the NIV is handiest, and of course I don't<br>
want to waste too much bandwidth listing all the translations :^)<br>
<p>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
2 Pet 2:9 <br>
<p>
KJV	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to<br>
	reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: <br>
<p>
NIV	if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from<br>
	trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while<br>
	continuing their punishment. <br>
<p>
in this case the NIV as well as many of the newer versions teach the doctrine <br>
of ongoing suffering in purgatory.<br>
<p>
-------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Exo 20:8-10<br>
<p>
KJV	Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  <br>
	Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:	<br>
	But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou<br>
	shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy<br>
	manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger<br>
	that is within thy gates: 	<br>
<p>
ASV 	Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 	<br>
	Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; 	<br>
	but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: (in it) thou<br>
	shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy<br>
	man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger<br>
	that is within thy gates: 	<br>
<p>
NIV	"Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. 	<br>
	Six days you shall labor and do all your work,	<br>
	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you<br>
	shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor<br>
	your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien<br>
	within your gates. 	<br>
<p>
Now what is it to be, just "a" Sabbath, anyday you wish, one of many, <br>
or is it to be THE Sabbath of God? We know what the evangelicals think.<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Dan 8:14 <br>
<p>
KJV	And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then<br>
	shall the sanctuary be cleansed. 	<br>
<p>
NIV	He said to me, "It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the<br>
	sanctuary will be reconsecrated." 	<br>
<p>
This reading plainly obliterates the doctrine of the cleansing of <br>
the Sancutary. Well, was it cleansed in 1844 or not ? What does it mean<br>
to be reconsecrated? Definitively not even remotely the same as cleansed.<br>
 <br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
As before I won't be entering any discussion as to the whys, wherefores<br>
and whatnots of bible translations and manuscripts.<br>
<p>

If you recall the disaster in Washington State regarding Jack in the Box<br>
Resturants and e coli contamination, I have some information that makes<br>
me think that we have been lied to regarding the REAL reason e coli was<br>
in those burgers.<br>
<p>
Some years past, I did a research paper for my college English class<br>
that was on modern meat.  It turns out that in recent studies, nearly<br>
two thirds of samples of ground beef exceeded federal standards for e<br>
coli contamination, and about one fourth of those exceeded the standards<br>
by 100 times.<br>
<p>
 From my waste water engineering class several years back, I learned that<br>
e coli is a so-called "indicator organism" that is measured to see if a<br>
treated waste water sample is free of pathogens.  <br>
<p>
E coli live naturally in the human intestines.  It is a natural<br>
component of municipal sewage.  The elimination of this organism in<br>
treated waste water shows that other harder to trace pathogens have been<br>
eliminated.<br>
<p>
As far as I can determine, untreated sewage should be the only way this<br>
organism could enter the food supply.  How this gets into ground beef, I<br>
don't even want to try to guess.  <br>
<p>
I really don't believe that the reason this organism entered the food<br>
supply was due to undercooking of the hamburger meat.  You mean to tell<br>
me over the decades and the billions of hamburgers sold in this country,<br>
it is only now that this contamination came forth?  In all those<br>
resturants, they all happened to undercook their burgers over the same<br>
short period of time?  <br>
<p>
The point in all of this is that our meat supply is definitely not safe.<br>
 You don't really need a religious reason to consider vegetarianism.<br>

Ruben says of Christ <br>
"He had never been separated from His father, we often are."<br>
<p>
I agree with this statement fully.  But it seems that when I posted<br>
something similiar (and meant what is above) there were howls of protest<br>
from Ruben and others.  Could it be that there is no difference between<br>
my position and his after all?  (acknowledging that there are many positions<br>
far to the left of me).<br>

In the long article from Dennis Priebe, the periodical Evangelica was <br>
mentioned several times.  This periodical was active during the height<br>
of the Desmond Ford debate, published in the southwestern Michigan <br>
SDA colony if I understand it right, between 1980 and 1982.  Our family<br>
was on their mailing list.  The article quotes Francis Campbell, at the <br>
time president of the South African Union, without making clear that<br>
at the time he stood firmly in that camp and actually left the church <br>
for a short time and then later returned.<br>
<p>
I find it strange that the doctrine on righteousness by faith is declared<br>
to be "Historical Adventism" by the <br>
Our Firm Foundation crowd (of which Priebe is a member in good standing).<br>
The 1888 Message Study Committee argues just as loudly that the message<br>
of righteousness by faith has never been accepted by the church as a whole,<br>
and I would have to say they are right.<br>
<p>
If our theology is based on one translation of the English bible over<br>
the other (which it may be in some cases because the pioneers didn't<br>
know Greek), then we have a problem.  If people want to use the small<br>
wording <br>
changes as noted by Ruben to avoid acknowledging the truths of Adventism,<br>
then they are looking for excuses anyway.  <br>
<p>

you should try it.  SCT]<br>

<p>
There are two reasonable-sounding explanations that I've heard concerning<br>
this text:<br>
<p>
1) The Hebrews observed several "sabbath days" other than THE seventh-day<br>
Sabbath of the fourth commandment.  I don't have the Scriptural support<br>
here at hand for this, but I know it to be true that other feast/festival<br>
days were referred to as "sabbaths."    The seventh-day Sabbath would not<br>
be just "a sabbath day" -- it would be THE Sabbath, and Paul would assume<br>
that his audience would make the distinction in their minds.  The context<br>
seems to bear this out, as it speaks of "festivals" and "new moons," and<br>
does not refer to other of the ten commandments.<br>
<p>
2) Even if this were a reference to the seventh-day Sabbath, Paul is<br>
correct in stating that we should not "judge" anyone concerning their<br>
keeping of these festivals or ceremonies.  It has not been appointed to us<br>
to judge, and we all know the dangers of judging fellow believers.  All<br>
judgment ultimately belongs to God.  We can teach; we can encourage; we<br>
can support; but, I don't feel, we can judge or condemn.<br>

Hi, I just got this mail from a friend of mine in Texas names Sharon Teo.<br>
-beng<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
During lunch, I wittnessed a 'live' tv telecast on CBS news (with my sis)<br>
of the Branch Davidian Complex burning down.....so looks like its gonna be<br>
over soon!<br>
<p>
It seems that the Fbi agents got tired of waiting and decided to<br>
"encourage" those pple in the compound to get out by pumping in some tear gas<br>
into the complex.  They did it at 6 a.m.<br>
<p>
At about 11:45am they saw a small explosion and the building caught fire.<br>
They reported that according to their surveilence cameras they(FBI) said<br>
they saw 2 men, whom they believe to be cult members starting a fire on<br>
each corner of the complex.<br>
<p>
several pple ( abt 4) ran out of the complex, and when I left, the whole<br>
complex was in ruins.....nothing was left standing, except the flagpole <br>
.......and, guess what?.........they still couldn't find Koresh , the rest<br>
of the adults and the supposedly 70 children!!  they did mention that they<br>
may be hiding in an underground bunker, but they said that they wouldn't<br>
survive 'cos the fire above wld suck all the oxygen from the bunkers.<br>
<p>
In case you're wondering abt fire engines....yeah.....2 came at about<br>
12:40pm!!!<br>
<p>
They kept repeating statements from the White House stating that the FBI<br>
was not responsible for the fire 'cos they said the levels of tear gas<br>
used were not poisonous and that tear gas was not flammable, etc.<br>
<p>
Anyway, another friend of mine watched a CNN broadcast at abt 1:30pm. <br>
Their version of what happened is , well....not the same!!<br>
<p>
They reported that (I think) about 6 pple are in the FBI's custody and<br>
that 2 of them are seriously injured. <br>
<p>
They reported that to pump the tear gas into the complex, they used an <br>
amoured vehicle(tank?) to drill a hole into the wall.<br>
They said that it was the FBI's fault 'cos by doing that, they caused some<br>
damage....like wires and stuff, I think, which caused a fire to ignite,<br>
and which later caused the explosion, etc.....no mention of 2 cult members<br>
starting fires!!!!<br>
<p>
to date, they haven't found anyone else.<br>
<p>
I guess this marks the end of the standoff......maybe.....but I guess its<br>
not going to be over till they find Koresh and the rest!!<br>
<p>
Ohyah.....it seems Koresh replied, when asked by those in the compound-<br>
when they would leave the compound, koresh said that they would leave<br>
 when they saw God's face.<br>
<p>
Anyway, I'll watch the news at 6 pm (in 10 mins.) and I'll keep you updated.<br>
<p>
Sharon.<br>

<p>
I didn't know that. Thanks for the info. Well, Chinese (i am one) use a lot<br>
of soy sauce in their cooking, there are 2 varieties, a "light" brown watery<br>
type which has a different taste from just salt, and a darker less watery<br>
type which tastes more like plain salt. They have different uses. There is<br>
also a thick sweet type of soysauce.<br>
<p>
Although it is fermented, i do not think it has any alcohol in it, at least<br>
i can't smell any. It doesn't smell fermented at all, come to that.<br>
<p>
The indians (not red indians) have a kind of soybean food called Tempei,<br>
which is fermented soybeans, fried in batter, and i hear that it is also<br>
high in B12.<br>
<p>
I wonder why fermented soybean products have B12. Perhaps they get<br>
contaminated by symbiotic bacteria from the soybean roots (pseudomonas?)<br>
which grow when fermentation takes place, and make the vitamin.<br>
<p>
Besides B12, soybean products (bean curds etc) is a very good source of<br>
protein, and essential amino acids, of which it lacks only one, which is<br>
obtainable from grain protein.<br>
