<LI>The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by
Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter was drawn up at the
Inter-Governmental Conference on the Dumping of Wastes at Sea,
held in London from 30 October to 10 November 1972.  The
Governments of Mexico, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
United States of America are the Depositary Governments for
instruments of ratification of, and accession to, the Convention,
pursuant to Articles XVII and XVIII respectively.

<H3>Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping
of Wastes and other Matter</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Contracting Parties to this Convention,
<P>         
<I>Recognizing</I> that the marine environment and the living
organisms which it supports are of vital importance to humanity,
and all people have an interest in assuring that it is so managed
that its quality and resources are not impaired;
<P>         
<I>Recognizing</I> that the capacity of the sea to assimilate
wastes and render them harmless, and its ability to regenerate
natural resources, is not unlimited;
<P>         
<I>Recognizing</I> that States have, in accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international
law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant
to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to
ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do
not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas
beyond the limits of national jurisdiction;
<P>         
<I>Recalling</I> Resolution 2749 (XXV) of the General Assembly of
the United Nations on the principles governing the sea-bed and
the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of
national jurisdiction;
<P>         
<I>Noting</I> that marine pollution originates in many sources,
such as dumping and discharges through the atmosphere, rivers,  
estuaries, outfalls and pipelines, and that it is important that
States use the best practicable means to prevent such pollution
and develop products and processes which will reduce the amount
of harmful wastes to be disposed of;
<P>         
<I>Being convinced</I> that international action to control the
pollution of the sea by dumping can and must be taken without
delay but that this action should not preclude discussion of
measures to control other sources of marine pollution as soon as
possible; and
<P>         
<I>Wishing</I> to improve protection of the marine environment by
encouraging States with a common interest in particular
geographical areas to enter into appropriate agreements
supplementary to this Convention;
<P>
Have agreed as follows:
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>
Article I
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>         
Contracting Parties shall individually and collectively promote

environment, and pledge themselves especially to take all
practicable steps to prevent the pollution of the sea by the
dumping of waste and other matter that is liable to create
hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine
life, to damage amenities or to interfere with other legitimate
uses of the sea.
<P>

DEFINITION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
<P>         
The Definition and Recommendations set forth in this Document
should not be interpreted as precluding the adoption of more
restrictive requirements by any Party to the Convention or
<I>appropriate</I> national authorities, pursuant to Articles IV.
3 and Vl. 3 of the Convention. Nothing in this Document shall be
construed as encouraging the dumping <I>at sea</I> of radioactive
waste or other radioactive matter.
<P>         
A. DEFINITION
<P>         
A.1. <I>Definition of High-Level
Radioactive Wastes or Other
High-Level Radioactive Matter Unsuitable for Dumping at Sea<A
HREF="#definition">[1]</A> </I>
<P>         
A. 1.1. For the purposes of Annex I to the Convention, high-level
radioactive wastes or other high-level radioactive matter
unsuitable for dumping at sea means any waste or other matter
with <I>an activity</I> per unit gross mass (in tonnes)
exceeding:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) 1 Ci/t for alpha-emitters but limited to 10<SUP>-1</SUP>
Ci/t
for <SUP>226</SUP>Ra and supported <SUP>210</SUP>Po;
<P>         
<DD>(b) 10<SUP>2</SUP> Ci/t for /7-emitters with half-lives of at
least 0.5 years (excluding tritium) and  -emitters of unknown
half-lives; and
<P>         
<DD>(c) 10<SUP>6</SUP> Ci/t for tritium and /7-emitters with
half-lives of less than 0.5 years.
</DL>
<P>         
The above activity concentrations shall be averaged over a gross
mass not exceeding <I>1000 tonnes</I>.
<P>         
A.1.2. The Definition must not be taken to imply that material
falling outside the Definition is thereby deemed to be suitable
for dumping.
<P>         
A.1.3. Materials of activity concentrations less than those in
the above Definition shall not be dumped except in accordance 
with the provisions of the Convention, in particular Annexes II
and III thereto, and the Recommendations set out in this
Document, <I>in particular Section B.1.2.</I>
<P>        
B. THE RECOMMENDED BASIS FOR ISSUING SPECIAL PERMITS FOR
RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS LISTED IN ANNEX II TO THE CONVENTION
<P>         
B.1.    <I>Environmental Evaluation of Specific Dumping
Applications</I>
<P>         
B.1.1. The appropriate national authorities shall not grant a
special permit for dumping of radioactive waste unless a detailed
environmental and ecological assessment gives a reasonable
assurance that such dumping can be accomplished in accordance
with the objectives and provisions of the Convention and the
Recommendations set out in this Document.
<P>         
B.1.2. When granting a special permit, the appropriate national
authorities shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that the
proposed dumping operation complies with the radiation protection
requirements set forth in the IAEA Basic Safety
Standards for Radiation Protection<A HREF="#note2">[2]</A>. These
requirements are
based upon the System of dose limitation of the International
Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) which requires that:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(1) The operations should be justified by assessing their net
benefits, taking into consideration the radiation consequences
and the possibilities of alternative procedures:
<P>         
<DD>(2) The radiation protection aspects of the operation should
be optimized, keeping the resulting collective doses (including
their occupational and public components) as low as is reasonably
achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account;
and
<P>         
<DD>(3) The doses to individual members of the public should not
reach the appropriate dose limits, now or in the future. In
estimating the doses, account must be taken of other practices
which might expose the same critical population groups.
</DL>
<P>         
In particular, the upper limits to activity release rates from
all sources (other than natural sources) when released into an
ocean basin with a volume of not less than 10<SUP>17</SUP>
m<SUP>3</SUP> shall not exceed:
<P>         
<DL>         
<DD>(a) 10<SUP>5</SUP> Ci/year for a-emitters but only
10<SUP>4</SUP> Ci/year for <SUP>226</SUP>Ra and supported
<SUP>210</SUP>Po;
<P>         
<DD>(b) 10<SUP>8</SUP> Ci/year for g/-emitters with half-lives of
at least 0.5 years (excluding tritium and /7-emitters of unknown
half-lives;
<P>         
<DD>(c) 10<SUP>12</SUP> Ci/year for tritium and /-emitters with
half-lives of less than 0.5 years.
</DL>
<P>         
No special permit should be issued which would cause these limits
to be approached.
<P>         
B.1.3. It is essential that a general policy of continued
isolation and containment of radioactive waste after descent to
the sea-bed should be pursued through the use of suitable    
packaging to minimize to the extent reasonably achievable the
radioactivity which might ultimately be released, thereby
preventing unnecessary contamination of the marine environment.
<P>         
B.1.4. <I>(formerly B.1.2 in the previous Document)</I> The
environmental assessment shall include, in addition to
the factors specified in Annex III to the Convention,
consideration of:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(1) The justification for the proposed dumping
<I>operation</I> when weighed against land-based alternatives,
including the respective population dose commitments;
<P>         
<DD>(2) The total alpha, beta and gamma activities and the
activity of any individual nuclide of special significance for
the assessment;
<P>         
<DD>(3) Those factors likely to affect significantly the movement
of radioactive materials from the dumping site to the human
environment, including the nature of the sea-bed and the physical
processes of mixing and transport in the sea at the dumping site;
<P>         
<DD>(4) Dose commitments to individual members of the public and
to the population via critical and other appropriate pathways;
<P>         
<DD>(5) The risk to marine ecosystems resulting from the release
of radioactivity from dumped packages;
<P>         
<DD>(6) The degree to which it is practical to attempt to reduce
dose commitments, either for normal dumping or in case of
accidents, by techniques such as having the radioactive material
in a relatively insoluble form or within a relatively insoluble
matrix, by designing the containment to retain for a period of
time radioactive material when it is on the sea-bed, or by
selecting an area with characteristics that will facilitate the
retention of the radioactive material in the vicinity of the
dumping site;
<P>         
<DD>(7) Operational methods to be used, including arrangements
for dealing with accidents and emergencies and methods of
verifying their correct execution.
</DL>
<P>         
B.1.5. <I>(formerly B.1.3 in the previous Document)</I> The IAEA
is
of the opinion that it is necessary that the
reports to be submitted, pursuant to Article VI.4 of the
Convention, to the <I>Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative   

Organization (IMCO)</I> include this environmental assessment in
relation to an individual application for a special permit for
dumping.
<P>         
B.2. <I>Monitoring and Assessment</I>
<P>         
B.2.1. In the context of dumping carried out in accordance with
the Convention, the following requirements shall be met:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(1) Determination by measurement or estimation of the nature
and quantities of radioactive waste or other radioactive material
to be dumped; and
<P>         
<DD>(2) Monitoring, to the extent feasible and meaningful, of the
condition of the seas with respect to dumped radioactive wastes
in the vicinity of the dumping site, taking into full account the
relevant guidance as provided for in the IAEA
Safety Series No. 5<A HREF="#note3">[3]</A> and the ICRP
Publication 7<A HREF="#note4">[4]</A>.
</DL>
<P>
B.3.    <I>Environmental Evaluation of 'Total Dumping</I>
<P>         
B.3.1. In addition to the environmental assessment in relation to
an individual application for a special permit for dumping, the
appropriate national authorities shall take the following factors
into account in determining whether each proposed dumping
operation is acceptable:

<P>       
C. THE RECOMMENDED DETAILED BASIS FOR OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF    
DUMPING WASTE
<P>         
C.1. <I>General Requirements Governing Operational Control of
Dumping of Waste</I>
<P>         
C.1.1. The dumping of liquid or unpackaged radioactive waste into
surface and shallow waters should not be authorized until such
time as the IAEA formulates appropriate recommendations governing
such dumping. The direct dumping of unpackaged liquid radioactive
waste into the deep sea shall be prohibited since such waste
would not be sufficiently dense or immiscible with sea-water to
descend to and remain on the sea-bed. The dumping of packaged
liquid radioactive waste into the deep sea is specifically
excluded pursuant to Section C.3.2.2. Solid radioactive wastes
where the radioactivity is intrinsically contained in a
relatively insoluble matrix and which can be shown not to
disperse before reaching the sea-bed, do not require packaging
and can be dumped in the deep sea under the same requirements as
for packaged solid waste.
<P>         
C.1.2. In order to make an assessment for the Definition <I>of
material which is unsuitable for dumping, a model was developed
based on a calculated upper limit to radioactivity release rates
from all sources. For operational control these calculated values
were expressed as activity per unit-gross mass in tonnes based
upon</I> an assumed dumping rate of 100 000 tonnes per year at
any site.  This assumed rate of dumping should not be interpreted
as implying that such a rate will be reached or as encouraging
such a rate. It would be prudent for the appropriate national
authorities to authorize dumping at the lowest rate which is
reasonably practicable, having regard to the development of
applications of nuclear energy.         
<P>
C.1.3. The dumping operation must be subject to strict control. A
number of factors have to be taken into consideration. They
concern, in particular, the conditioning and packaging of the
waste in order to ensure safe transport and handling, and
minimization of the risk of accidental recovery of containers
after disposal. This is covered by operational measures dealing
with the choice of a suitable dumping site, the design and
construction of waste containers, the choice of an appropriate
ship able to dispose of the waste at the given dumping site,
provisions for radiation protection of the crew, and an adequate
supervision of the dumping operations by competent escorting
officers. All these operational requirements shall, therefore, be
included in the special permits issued by the appropriate
national authorities in accordance with the Convention.
<P>
C.2. <I>Requirements for Selection of a Dumping Site</I>
<P>         
C. 2.1. In addition to the factors specified in Annex III to the
Convention, the following requirements shall be met by the
appropriate national authorities in the selection of a site for
the dumping of packaged waste:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(1) The chance of recovering the waste by processes such as
trawling shall be minimized;
<P>         
<DD>(2) Dumping shall be restricted to those areas of the oceans
between latitudes 50<SUP>o</SUP>N and 50<SUP>o</SUP>S. The area
shall have an average water depth greater than 4000 metres.
Recognizing that variations in sea-bed topography do exist, this
restriction should not be interpreted to exclude those sites
within which there are localized areas with water depths of 3600
metres;
<P>         
<DD>(3) Sites should be located clear of continental margins and
open sea islands, and not in marginal or inland seas. Nor should
they be situated in known areas of natural phenomena, for example
volcanic activity, that would make the site unsuitable for
dumping;
<P>         
<DD>(4) The area must be free from known undersea cables
currently in use,
<P>      
<DD>(5) Areas shall be avoided that have potential sea-bed
resources which may be exploited either directly by mining or by
the harvest of marine products, or indirectly (e.g. spawning) as
feeding grounds for marine organisms important to man:
<P>         
<DD>(6) The number of dumping sites shall be strictly limited;
and
<P>         
<DD>(7) The area must be suitable for the convenient conduct of
the dumping operation and so far as possible shall be chosen to
avoid the risk of collision with other traffic during
manoeuvering and undue navigational difficulties. The area chosen
should preferably be one covered by electronic navigational aids.
</DL>
<P>         
C.2.2. The dumping site shall be defined by precise co-ordinates.
In order to ensure a reasonable operational flexibility, it
should have an area <I>as small as practicable, but no larger
than</I> 10<SUP>4</SUP> square kilometres.
<P>         
C.3. <I>Special Requirements for Packages for Dumping</I>
<P>         
C. 3.1. General
<P>         
C. 3.1.1. In addition to the provisions of Article IV of the
Convention, the following requirements for conditioning,
handling, transport and immersion shall be met.
<P>         
C.3.2. Conditioning of Waste
<P>         
C.3.2.1. Waste in the package shall be either solid, solidified
or absorbed in a solid substrate.
<P>         
C.3.2.2. Waste in liquid form shall be excluded, <I>because its
rise to the surface cannot be precluded</I>. Small quantities of
liquids such as tritiated water may, however, be absorbed
<I>in</I> a material of good absorption capacity. Containers of
such absorbed liquids shall be mounted within a second enclosure
of an appropriate design.
<P>
C.3.3. Handling and Transport
<P>         
C.3.3.1. The relevant provisions of the IAEA
Transport
Regulations<A HREF="#note5">[5]</A> shall be complied with,
together with any
applicable national and international transport regulations for  
dangerous goods. In particular, the packages shall be designed to
ensure adequate containment of the waste during handling and
transport until the end of the dumping operations.
<P>         
C.3.4. Immersion
<P>         
C.3.4.1. The packages shall be designed to ensure that the
contents are retained within them during descent to the sea-bed.
To achieve this, the following requirements shall be met: 
<P>
<DL>
<DD>         
(1) The package shall have an overall specific gravity of not
less than 1.2 to ensure sinking to the sea-bed to a depth greater
than <I>4000</I> metres;
<P>         
<DD>(2) The design shall be such that any inner container will
remain on the sea-bed;
<P>         
<DD>(3) The container shall be made sufficiently strong or
pliable to remain intact and retain its contents under the
pressure encountered during descent to the sea-bed, or be
equipped with a pressure equalization system which relieves the
stress on the container; and
<P>         
<DD>(4) Buoyant material shall be excluded unless it is treated
or packaged so as either to preclude the return of such material
to surface waters or to ensure that, on its return, it  ill not
constitute a radiation hazard nor interfere materially with
fishing, navigation or other legitimate uses of the sea.
</DL>
<P>         
C.4. <I>Approval of the Ship and its Equipment</I>
<P>         
C.4.1. Certain special requirements are necessary for ships
engaged in the dumping of packaged radioactive wastes. These
requirements are set out below:

I. INTRODUCTION
<P>         
1.1.  <I>The London Dumping Convention of 1972</I>
<P>         
1.1.1. The Convention on the Prevention of
Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter
<A HREF="#text">[1]</A> was
adopted by an Intergovernmental Conference which met in London
from 30 October to 13 November 1972, at the invitation of the
Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland. The Convention was opened for signature by any State at
London, Mexico City, Moscow and Washington from 29 December 1972
until 31 December 1973 and thereafter for accession by any State.
After the entry into force of the Convention on 30 August 1975, a
meeting of the Contracting Parties to decide on organizational
matters, held in London from 17 to 19 December 1975, designated
the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO)
as the Organization responsible for Secretariat duties in
relation to the Convention. The Convention provides for control
of "any deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from
vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea"
and any deliberate disposal of such vessels, aircraft, etc.
themselves. The prevention of marine pollution emanating from the
normal operations of vessels, aircraft, etc. or directly arising
from the exploration and exploitation of sea-bed mineral
resources is excluded from the scope of the Convention (Article
III.1).
<P>         
1.1.2. With respect to radioactive materials, the Convention
entrusts the IAEA  with specific responsibilities in the
following provisions pursuant to Article IV:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(1) In Annex I on materials prohibited from dumping, item 6
states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>         
"High-level radioactive wastes or other high-level radioactive
matter, defined on public health, biological or other grounds, by
the competent international body in this field, at present the
International Atomic Energy Agency, as unsuitable for dumping at
sea";
</BLOCKQUOTE>         
<DD>(2) In Annex II on materials requiring special care i dumping
procedures, item D states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>         
"Radioactive wastes or other radioactive matter not included in
Annex I. In the issue of permits for the dumping of this matter,
the Contracting Parties should take full account of the
recommendations of the competent international body in this
field, at present the International Atomic Energy Agency".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</DL>
<P>         
1.1.3. Article IV.1 of the Convention makes a distinction
between materials that may be dumped after the issue of a general
permit and those that may be dumped only after the issue of a
special permit. Annex II puts "radioactive wastes or other
radioactive matter" into the class requiring special permits
without, however, defining such radioactive wastes or matter.
<P>         
1.1.4.   Article IV. 3 of the Convention provides that no
provision thereof is to be interpreted as preventing a
<I>Contracting</I> Party from prohibiting, in so far as that
Party is concerned, the dumping of wastes or other matter not
listed in Annex I. Further, the content of the Annexes to the
Convention will be kept under review by consultative meetings of
the <I>Contracting</I> Parties, which will be convened not less
frequently than once every two years, or by special meetings
which may be convened at any time on the request of two thirds of
the Parties, pursuant to Article XIV. 3(a), 4(a) and 4(b) of the
Convention. Amendments to the Annexes, which will be based on
scientific and technical considerations, are subject to a
simplified procedure as compared with amendments to the basic
provisions of the Convention (Article XV.2).
<P>         
1.1.5.   Further, Article IV. 2 of the Convention provides that
all the factors specified in Annex III thereto should be given
careful consideration prior to the issue of any permit, including
prior studies of the characteristics of the dumping sites as set
forth in Sections B and C of that Annex.
<P>         
1.2.    <I>Purpose of this Annex</I>
<P>         
1.2.1. This Annex provides background material pertinent to the
specific responsibilities entrusted to the IAEA under the
Convention, namely to define "high-level radio-active wastes or
other high-level radioactive matter .... unsuitable for dumping
at sea" and to ensure that any dumping of radioactive matter into
the sea involves no unacceptable degree of hazard to man and his
environment. It provides information on the way the IAEA arrived
at the <I>revised</I> Definition and outlines the thinking behind
the Recommendations which are set out rather formally and without
elaboration in the Definition and Recommendations.
<P>         
II.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION
<P>         
2.1.    <I>Radiation Protection Principles to be applied to Waste
Management</I>
<P>         
2.1.1. The rapid development and increasing use of nuclear energy
or peaceful purposes and the expanding application of
radioisotopes in various fields of science, medicine and
technology are unavoidably associated with the production of
growing amounts of radioactive wastes. The basic principle to be
applied in the management of radioactive wastes is to protect man
and other sensitive elements of the biosphere from undue exposure
to ionizing radiation emanating from these wastes.
<P>         
2.1.2.   In selecting an appropriate waste management system it
should be verified that natural resources are protected and that
any reduction of amenities is acceptably low. Man is dependent
upon the land and the sea, and both must be protected.
<P>         
2.1.3. A balance has to be achieved between the need to find
suitable storage or disposal methods, the radiation protection of
workers and members of the public, and the overall cost involved.
The justification for dumping radioactive wastes must be viewed
in this light.
<P>         
2.1.4. The most recent applicable recommendations <I>by the
International Commission on Radiological Protection</I> (ICRP)
should be used as a guide in this area.
<P>         
2.2.    <I>Sources of Radioactivity in the Sea</I>
<P>         
2.2.1. Radioactive wastes may enter the sea through one of the
following major routes, by:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(1) Direct dumping of the wastes into the seas and oceans;
<P>         
<DD>(2) Discharge to river systems;
<P>         
<DD>(3) Discharge to tidal estuaries;
<P>         
<DD>(4) Discharge to coastal waters;
<P>         
<DD>(5) Discharge from nuclear-powered ships; and
<P>
<DD>(6) Deposition from the atmosphere.
</DL>
<P>
2.2.2.   Some solid wastes have been dumped in packaged form
in the depths of the sea. This form of disposal has been limited
to materials with low radioactivity content for example, during
the 1967-1977 period a total of about 51 600 tonnes of packaged
solid radioactive waste, containing about 5900 curies of
a-emitters, about 190 000 curies of emitters and, additionally,
about 183 000 curies of tritium has been dumped in the north-east
Atlantic Ocean. The annual amounts dumped during that period,
expressed as fractions of the limiting release rates implied in
the Definition, never exceeded 
<P>
<DL>
<DD>1% for a-emitters
<P>         
<DD>1% for /emitters with half-lives of at least 0.5 years
(excluding tritium)
<P>         
<DD>10<SUP>-4</SUP> % for tritium 
</DL>
<P>
and only twice approached 10% of the assumed upper limit to the
mass dumping rate.
<P>         
2.2.3.   Unlike many of the stresses presently confronting man,
radiation and radioactivity have always been a part of man's
environment. Studies by the United Nations  Scientific Committee
on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) show that the
present doses to humans of naturally occurring radiation lie
generally in the range of 100 mrem/yr to 300 mrem/yr  with doses
in a few areas exceeding 1000 mrem/yr. The main contributions to
this exposure are radioactive materials in the earth's crust,
cosmic radiation and natural radioactivity in the human body
(mainly <SUP>40</SUP>K).
<P>         
2.2.4. The marine environment contains a wide range of natural
radionuclides mainly <SUP>40</SUP>K, <SUP>87</SUP>Rb, members of
the uranium and
thorium series, and <SUP>14</SUP>C and <SUP>3</SUP>H. The total
activity in all of the
sea (mainly <SUP>40</SUP>K) amounts to rather more than 300
Ci/km<SUP>3</SUP>
or nearly 500 000 MCi in total. Radium alone accounts for more
than 1000 MCi. The doses to marine organisms are usually of the
order of 10 mrad/yr to 100 mrad/yr.
<P>         
2.2.5. Though the total naturally occurring radioactive content
of the sea is very large, this does not provide a sure basis for
determining what quantities of radioactivity may be added in
local areas without leading to unacceptable additional exposures
to man or the marine environment. Though such additions may be
relatively small in quantity, the hazards associated with
localized releases of wastes must be assessed and considerable
care exercised, as contemplated by the Convention, in disposing
of any radioactive wastes into the marine environment.
<P>         
2.2.6. Man has been dealing with radioactive materials in
artificially concentrated or artificially produced forms for
nearly three quarters of a century and has been generating
electrical power from nuclear fission for over a decade. Man has
also released radioactive material as the result of several
series of nuclear explosions.
<P>         
2.2.7.   These operations have all resulted in some radionuclides
being released into the environment, including the sea. Apart
from short-lived <I>radionuclides</I> close to the scene of
nuclear
explosions, the quantities released to the sea so far amount to
some hundreds of megacuries from explosions and a few megacuries
from nuclear operations. To date, civilian nuclear power
programmes have accounted for only a small fraction of these
latter releases. These quantities amount to less than one
thousandth (10<SUP>-3</SUP>) of the natural activity in the sea.
This fraction gives an indication of the relative magnitudes, but
no such simple comparison of activities can indicate the relative
biological importance of the different <I>radionuclides. They</I>
have very widely ranging toxicities, and their significance in a
given environment depends not only on this fact but also on their
distribution and on the uses made of that environment
<P>         
2.3. <I>Basis of the Definition (High-Level Radioactive Wastes or
Other High-Level Radioactive Matter Unsuitable for Dumping at
Sea)</I>
<P>         
2.3.1. The Definition<A HREF="#annex_2">[2]</A> identifies
material, the radioactive content of which is at such a level
that the Parties to the Convention would wish to prevent any
participating State from issuing a special permit even after a
detailed appraisal of the safety of the proposed operation, and
even for the sector of the <I>marine environment furthest removed
from man</I>, i.e. the deep sea with depth greater than <I>4000
metres</I>. The Definition also covers those waste which <I>have
relatively high concentrations of radioactivity</I> and have been
generally recognized by the
appropriate national authorities as being unsuitable for dumping,
for example the "first cycle wastes" from nuclear reprocessing,
irradiated fuel and irradiated fuel cladding. The Definition must
not be so permissive that regular and repeated operations
somewhat below the defined level would endanger man or his
environment, even though each individual operation had been
conducted with appropriate care. The Definition has, therefore,
been based on the concept of the limiting capacity of the deep
oceans to receive radioactive waste, which capacity is based on
the annual input of radioactivity which will result in individual
dose commitments via the critical pathways equal to the dose
limits for individual members of the public recommended by the
ICRP. <A HREF="#annex_*">*</A>
<P>         
2.3.2. The limiting capacity of the oceans to receive radioactive
waste has been extensively reviewed by a series of Consultants'
Meetings and Advisory Group Meetings convened by the IAEA during
1976-1978.
<P>         
2.3.2.1. The IAEA convened two Consultants' Meetings to review
the Oceanographic Basis of the Provisional Definition and
Recommendations: one at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA, in December 1976, and the other
at the Fisheries Laboratory, Lowestoft, United Kingdom, in
February 1977. A Working Paper prepared by the two Consultants'
Meetings was used as a basis for discussions at an Advisory Group
Meeting, which was held at IAEA Headquarters, Vienna, in March
1977, to review the oceanographic basis. The meeting was attended
by 25 experts from 12 countries and 4 international
organizations.
<P>         
2.3.2.2. In keeping with the recommendations of the Advisory
Group on the Oceanographic Basis, the IAEA convened in June 1977
a Consultants' Meeting to review the radiological basis, at IMCO
Headquarters, London. The consultants considered the conclusions
and recommendations of the Advisory Group on the Oceanographic
Basis as the primary guidelines and also took into account the
comments expressed at the First Consultative Meeting of the
Contracting Parties to the London Dumping Convention<A
HREF="#annex_3">[3]</A>, which was
held at IMCO Headquarters, London, from 20 to 24 September 1976.
<P>         
2.3.2.3. The conclusions of these meetings, which were laid down
in two reports <A HREF="#report4">[4]</A>, <A
HREF="#report5">[5]</A>, were further reviewed by an Advisory
Group Meeting, held in Vienna in March 1978. This meeting was
attended by 42 experts from 24 countries and 3 international
organizations. A summary of the conclusions concerning the
oceanographic basis, the radiological assessment, and the
implications for the Definition and Recommendations required by
the London Dumping Convention is given below.
<P>         
2.3.3.   The present knowledge of oceanic processes is
insufficient for the construction of a single comprehensive model
to describe the movement of radionuclides released on the ocean
bottom through the marine environment. Limiting calculations have
thus been made separately for the long- and short-term transports
of radionuclides in the ocean. These calculations have been made
assuming a continuous release of radionuclides from the deep
ocean over periods as long as 40 000 years which is commensurate
with the half-life of <SUP>239</SUP>Pu.
<P>         
2.3.3.1. The physical processes which could transport material in
the short term from the deep sea to where interactions would
occur with man's food chain on the time scale of months to years
are not well understood. On the basis of two calculations which
have been made for different possible mechanisms, it is
recommended however that, for the continuous release of 1 Ci/yr
from a single deep-sea dumping site, the waster concentration at
the place of interaction with man's food chain be taken to be
10<SUP>-6</SUP> Ci/m<SUP>3</SUP> and that site specific
calculations only be used if they result in larger
concentrations.         
<P>
2.3.3.2. For those radionuclides whose half-lives are longer than
the mixing time of a finite ocean basin, for example
<SUP>239</SUP>Pu, the well-mixed average concentration, including
decay, provides a more reliable estimate of the water
concentration than that given above for short-term processes. For
these long-lived radionuclides, this finite basin concentration
is greater than that specified above for the short-term processes
and determines both the permissible release rate from a single
site and from all sites in an ocean basin.
<P>         
2.3.3.3. At intermediate time scales, especially for those
radionuclides with half-lives similar to such time scales,
oceanographic modelling of the transport of radionuclides is
perhaps the most difficult. For these time scales it has been
considered reasonable, however, for releases from a single site
to use the concentrations given above for short-term processes
since it is unlikely intermediate time scale processes could lead
to larger concentrations.
<P>         
2.3.3.4. For the estimation of the total permissible release rate
in a finite ocean basin from all sites a model by Shepherd
(1976)<A HREF="#shepherd">[6]</A> has been recommended for all
time scales. This model
gives the correct long-term finite basin fuel-mixed average
concentration and is taken to have some validity at intermediate
and short time scales. The isolation of man and his food chain
from bottom water cannot be guaranteed due to biological pathways
short circuiting the physical transport of radioactivity. Bottom
water concentrations must therefore be limited to levels which
will be acceptable in surface waters. For the hazard assessment
the water concentration used in all cases is the bottom water
concentration calculated from the Shepherd model using a vertical
diffusion coefficient of 1 cm<SUP>2</SUP>/yr.
<P>         
2.3.3.5, In general, the long-term large-scale processes lead to
a release rate limit from all sites in a basin, whereas
short-term small-scale processes lead to a limit which applies to
a single-site only. The single-site release rate is more
restrictive for short-lived radionuclides and in this case
partitioning of waste between sites can increase the overall
limit for the basin as a whole, For long-lived radionuclides, the
long-term basin release rate is more restrictive and partitioning
of wastes between sites does not affect the limit for the basin
as a whole, Indeed, in this case, it is clear that the input of
radionuclides into the basin from all sources, including those
from other than the dumping of radioactive wastes, must be
included in any assessment of the release rate limit.
<P>         
2.3.3.6. Partition of radionuclides between water and sediment
will result in reduced concentrations in a particular medium. In
the hazard assessment no allowance was made for the removal of
radionuclides to one pathway when considering the other.
<P>         
2.3.3.7. Since estimates made of the transfer through the water
column from a dump site were principally based on knowledge of
processes in the large-scale anticyclonic oceanic gyres, they are
not applicable to marginal seas or to the poleward side of the
major oceanic gyres where deep convection or regions of low
stability may result in more intense exchanges.
<P>         
2.3.3.8. Keeping in mind both our present level of understanding
of oceanic processes and the attempt at generality in the
oceanographic basis, it is concluded that, for the continuous    
release of radionuclides in the deep ocean, the initial
concentration at the source is unlikely to be important in
determining the hazard to man; for long-lived radionuclides,    
calculated release rates must be interpreted as those arising
from all sources in an ocean  basin, whether these sources arise
from dumping operations or other activities; and, finally, that
future knowledge could result in estimates of release rates being
revised either upward or downward.
<P>         
2.3.4. In the radiological assessment, release rate limits were
derived for individual nuclides using the oceanographic basis as
described in 2.3.3 and postulating a number of representative
pathways by which man might become exposed to radiation after
release of radionuclides on the sea bed, resulting from dumping
operations.
<P>         
2.3.4.1. Pathways leading to exposure of man were selected to
include some which are known to exist and some which may become
important in the future. While the selected pathways are
generalized representations they are thought to provide
reasonable estimates of the maximum rates of transfer of
radioactivity to man by a variety of mechanisms. It was intended
that the parameters selected for the pathways should be
sufficiently general to cover population groups which could
become critical in various areas in the world. It is not
necessarily the case that unforeseen pathways will involve
significant changes;
it is probable that they will be covered in the essentials of one
of the selected pathways. The assessment evaluated each pathway
independently; however, where it appeared likely that members of
one critical group could also become members of another critical
group the calculated limits have been reduced accordingly. Twelve
pathways were selected, five of which involve the consumption of
sea food. The latter pathways are not intended to represent
particular species but examples of general fishery resource
pathways. The consumption rates used in this assessment are not
actual rates but reflect assumed maximum rates. In four pathways
the exposure of beach dwellers was considered. Since critical
groups of this type are likely to be exposed to all four
pathways, a combined limit was calculated. Three additional
pathways covering miscellaneous practices such as bathing, the
use of desalinated sea-water as drinking water and the use      
of sea salt for domestic needs were considered and combined.
<P>         
2.3.4.2. The release rate limits derived for the various pathways
were based on the ICRP dose limits for individual members of the
public. The philosophy underlying the procedure and the use of
critical groups is presented in ICRP publications. It should be
stressed that ICRP dose limits provide a lower boundary of an
unacceptable range of values. Values above the ICRP limits are
specifically to be avoided while values up to the limit are not
automatically permitted. The ICRP limits should be considered as
constraints for optimization procedures, which usually would
result in radiation doses much lower than the dose limits. On the
other hand, the dose limits are not thresholds above which
undesirable effects begin to appear, but represent dose values
corresponding to individual risks approaching unacceptable
levels.
<P>         
2.3.4.3. The maximum permissible annual intakes (MPAI)
corresponding to the dose limits were taken from the IAEA Basic
Safety Standards for Radiation Protection
<A HREF="#note7">[7]</A>. Pathways that
included the ingestion of radionuclides  which were transported
through sea-water were based on MPAIs for soluble forms of the
particular radionuclide. In the case of inhalation, the most
restrictive MPAIs have been used. The concentration factors     
used for each radionuclide in this assessment were obtained from
a number of publications. Where factors were not available for
certain elements or the potential pathways could not be
specifically identified, for example, deep ocean living
cephalopods, comparable values based on similar chemical elements
or species with similar behaviour were assumed.
<P>         
2.3.4.4. In the selection of radionuclides for the assessment,
consideration was given to those that were expected to occur in
wastes likely to be dumped at sea, including fission products,
activation products and actinides with half-live of more than a  
few days. The selection included some radionuclides which would
not normally arise in wastes from the nuclear fuel cycle but
which might arise from other sources.
<P>         
2.3.4.5. It should be noted that since the objective of the
radiological assessment was to derive release rate limits, and
since these by definition are related directly to the ICRP dose
limits, assessment of collective doses or collective dose
commitments as not done. This assessment would be appropriate for
the optimization procedures recommended by
ICRP<A HREF="#note8">[8]</A> and is a
requirement when granting a special permit for dumping of
radioactive  waste (see B.1.2 of the Recommendations).
<P>         
2.3.4.6. The permissible damage to the marine ecosystems due to
dumping operations was considered and it was concluded that the
radiation doses arising as a result of releases within the limits
of the Definition are not expected to lead to significant adverse
effects to populations as a whole.
<P>         
2.3.5. Release rate limits were derived for individual
radionuclides. For the sake of administrative convenience and
analytical simplicity the radionuclides were grouped into three
categories according to the basic properties of decay type and
half-life. The groupings and the appropriate release rate limits
are:

<P>          
The release rate limits represent the limit of the most
restrictive radionuclide in the particular group with two
exceptions. It was concluded, however, that these exceptions
could be included in their natural place in the grouping, either
because the calculations are considered quite conservative
because of unrealistic assumptions or because the relative
amounts compared to other radionuclides of importance are known
to be small. <A HREF="#report5">[5]</A>
<P>         
2.3.6. In the Provisional Definition and Recommendations two
explicit safety factors of 10<SUP>2</SUP> were applied to the
calculated release rate limits to allow for:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(a) The possible presence of more than one dumping site; and
<P>         
<DD>(b) The fact that certain areas of the ocean may have
characteristics less favourable than those assumed in the
assessment.
</DL>
<P>         
2.3.6.1. In the present assessment explicit account has been
taken of the possibility of multiple-sites by preparing estimates
both for single-sites and for a finite ocean volume. <A
HREF="#report4">[4]</A> The
oceanographic basis has also been constructed to take account of
possible extreme events in ocean areas so that the model is
insensitive to detailed parameter values in any particular ocean
area. It is therefore not appropriate to apply safety factors for
the same reasons to the present assessment.
<P>         
2.3.6.2. A review of the way in which the assessment was made
reveals that where specific data were not available conservative
assumptions were used in the calculations and this could result
in a substantial safety factor<A HREF="#report5">[5]</A>. Its
numerical value depends on
the particular radionuclide and set of circumstances and can
neither be determined precisely nor be guaranteed. Certain
important considerations, such as exposure of the critical  
group from more than one pathway or radionuclide and the possible
existence of unforeseen pathways from the deep ocean to man, were
taken into account. There was an attempt at all stages to make
the results of the assessment as general as possible. Therefore,
the release rates given above were adopted without modification
as being the best possible estimates which can be made for them
at the present time.
<P>         
2.3.7.   To meet the objectives of the Convention it is
necessary to express the Definition in terms of a concentration
(radioactivity per unit mass). The revised definition has
therefore been based on the release rate limits for a single-site
and an assumed upper limit on mass dumping rate at a single-site
of 100 000 tonnes/year. This leads directly to the concentration
limits given below:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(a) 1 Ci/t for alpha-emmiters but limited to 10<SUP>-1</SUP>
Ci/t for <SUP>226</SUP>Ra and
supported <SUP>210</SUP>Po;
<P>         
<DD>(b) 10<SUP>2</SUP> Ci/t for e/1-emitters with half-lives of
at least 0.5 years (excluding tritium) and mixtures of
B/-e'mitters of unknown half-lives;
<P>         
<DD>(c) 10<SUP>6</SUP> Cit for tritium and  emitters with
half-lives less than 0.5 years.
</DL>
<P>         
2.3.8.  The assumption of 100 000 tonnes/year is arbitrary and
the radiological hazards would not be materially altered if the
concentration figures were to be revised upward (or downward)
provided the release rate limits are observed.
<P>         
2.3.9.   The necessity to limit releases to finite ocean basins
(i. e. effectively to limit the number of sites per ocean basin)
has been met by an addition to paragraph B.1.2 of the
Recommendations which imposes the release rate limits for a
finite ocean volume of 10<SUP>17</SUP> m<SUP>3</SUP>. The
Definition and Recommendations have therefore been constructed so
that the single-site release rate limits are incorporated via the
combination of initial concentration of radioactivity and the
mass dumping rate. The finite ocean volume release rate limits
are incorporated as part of the Recommendations.
<P>         
2.3.10. <I>(paragraph 2.3.6 in the previous Document)</I>  In
practice, it is expected that areas selected for
dumping will be specially chosen as having favourable
characteristics. This fact, together with the <I>way in which    

the assessment was made</I>, ensures that man and his environment
should be protected if wastes of higher total activity than this
are prohibited from dumping. <I>Moreover, other wastes shall only
be disposed of at sea in accordance with special permits issued
by the appropriate national authorities alter ensuring that the
proposed dumping  operations comply with the radiation protection
requirements as in paragraph B.1.2 and after proper assessment of
the possible environmental impact.</I>
<P>         
2.3.11.  <I>(paragraph 2.3.10 in the previous document;
paragraphs 2.3.8 and 2.3.9 in the previous Document were no
longer appropriate and have been deleted)</I> The use of these
concentration limits would cause the
annual limits stated above to be approached only if the rate of
dumping at any one site approached 100 000 tonnes per year and if
all this material had an activity concentration close to the
concentration limits. The <I>assumed</I> annual dumping rate at
each site will be reviewed by <I>IMCO</I> and by the IAEA. The
appropriateness of the Definition in the light of actual dumping
rates will be kept under review by the IAEA.
<P>         
2.3.12.  For operational purposes it is necessary to average the
limiting values over a substantial mass of waste. It is
recommended that the limiting concentration in the Definition be
taken to be the average over a mass not exceeding <I>1000
tonnes</I>. Expressing the Definition as an activity <I>per unit
gross mass</I> averaged over a small fraction of the assumed
annual dumping rate should result in keeping the total activity
dumped annually below the <I>calculated</I> annual <I>release
rate</I> limits.
<P>         
2.3.13. The Definition must not be taken to imply that material
in which the concentration of radioactivity is below that
specified in the Definition is thereby deemed to be suitable for
dumping. No radioactive material may be dumped except in
accordance with the provisions of the Convention, in particular
Annexes II and III thereto, and with the Recommendations set out
in this Document.
<P>         
2.3.14. It should be noted that no material is totally devoid of
radioactivity. However, it is clearly not the intention of the
Convention that every material should be treated as a potential
radioactive pollutant and the competent authorities of the
<I>Contracting</I> Parties will wish to define some "de minimis"
level of specific activity below which a material will not be
regarded as "radioactive" for the purposes of the Convention. No
such numbers are suggested at this time and some flexibility of
interpretation is therefore left to the appropriate national
authorities. Although not derived for the purpose of dumping,
some guidance may be found in the levels set forth for exemption
of radioactive materials from regulatory control in various
international and national standards and regulations; such levels
are generally within an order of magnitude of 10<SUP>-3</SUP>
Ci/t.
<P>         
2.4. <I>Environmental Evaluation of Specific Dumping
Applications</I>
<P>         
2.4.1. The appropriate national authorities may grant a special
permit for dumping of radioactive waste only after a detailed
environmental and ecological assessment gives a reasonable
assurance that such dumping can be accomplished in accordance
with the objectives and provisions of the Convention
<P>         
2.4.2. At the levels of radioactive materials which may be
dumped under the terms of he Definition, the present state of
knowledge, cautiously interpreted, should provide a satisfactory
basis for environmental assessments. There is a substantial body
of relevant scientific literature, including publications of the
IAEA (e g. the Safety Series, the Technical Reports Series and
the Symposium Proceedings), ICRP and UNSCEAR. In carrying out
these environmental assessments it should not be necessary for
the
appropriate national authorities to require that detailed field
and experimental studies undertaken in every case. <I>Dumping
sites provide an opportunity for studying the interactions of
radionuclides with deep sea sediments and organisms. The IAEA
recommended that these studies be carried out where appropriate
and practical to obtain knowledge for future practices and
needs.</I>
<P>         
2.5. <I>Monitoring and Assessment</I>
<P>         
2.5.1. Article VI. l(c) and (d) of the Convention requires that
the appropriate national authorities:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>         
(1) Keep records of the nature and quantities of all matter
permitted to be dumped and the location, time and method of
dumping; and
<P>        
<DD>(2) Monitor individually, or in collaboration with other
parties and competent international organizations, the condition
of the seas for the purposes of the Convention.
</DL>
<P>         
2.5.2. As detailed in the relevant guidance provided by the IAEA
publications (particularly IAEA Safety Series
No. 5<A HREF="#note9">[9]</A>) and ICRP
Publication 7<A HREF="#note10">[10]</A>, the general objectives
of environmental
monitoring prorammes are as follows:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(1) The assessment of actual or potential exposure of man and
other sensitive elements of the biosphere, or estimation of upper
limits of such exposure; these assessments or estimations may be
needed in relation to regulator functions:
<P>         
<DD>(2) Scientific investigations;
<P>         
<DD>(3) Improved public understanding;
<P>         
<DD>(4) <I>Conservation of ocean resources</I>.
</DL>
<P>         
In the context of dumping carried out in accordance with the
Convention and the Recommendations set out in the Document, it is
unlikely that exposure assessment objectives could be entirely
fulfilled by direct environmental monitoring. The use of other
less direct methods (<I>e.g. modelling calculations</I>) could
provide more precise estimates. <I>However, environmental
monitoring combined with research can provide information testing
the validity of present assumptions and help to provide a sound
scientific basis for the conservation of ocean resources and for
future monitoring operations and an improved technical basis for
evaluating future practices. These studies should be carried
out.</I>
<P>         
2.6.    <I>Environmental Evaluation of Total Dumping</I>
<P>         
2.6.1. In addition to evaluating individual applications for
permits for dumping, the appropriate national authorities should
make periodic reviews of the total dumping which has been carried
out under permits issued by them. They should also consider the
dumping which has been carried out by other States. Further, they
should consider prospective dumping which ma reasonably be
expected. It is desirable that a comparable international review
also be carried out. Such reviews, after considering the past and
     
prospective quantities dumped, their locations, the significant
operating experience as reported by escorting officers and the
findings of pertinent oceanographic and ecological  research,
could lead the IAEA to update the Recommendations <I>set out in
the Document.</I>
<P>         
2.6.2. In addition to these reviews the <I>Contracting</I>
Parties to the Convention are required by Article VI. 4 to report
in detail to <I>IMCO</I> the special permits issued and the
nature and quantities of all matter permitted to be dumped,
together with the location, time and method of dumping. National
records are expected to contain all the information necessary
for such reporting as well as for the establishment of an
international register. The environmental assessment is
considered a necessary part of this information.
<P>         
2.7. <I>General Principles Governing Operational Control of
Dumping of Waste</I>
<P>         
2.7.1. Provisions to be considered in establishing criteria for
the issue of permits for dumping are set out in Annex III to the
Convention. The general principles for control of dumping of
radioactive waste are provided for in the IAEA's
Safety Series
No. 5<A HREF="#note8">[8]</A>. At present, dumping almost always
takes place in the
deep sea in packages with the waste either solid, solidified or
absorbed in a solid substrate. The dumping of radioactive waste
into surface and shallow waters from vessels, aircraft,
platforms, etc. may also be envisaged under the Convention; this
could involve higher exposure to man than dumping into the deep
sea. However, such dumping is expected to be rare in practice
and, pending the development of data concerning the nature,
extent and potential effects of such operations, the IAEA has not
yet formulated any specific recommendations for the operational
conduct of such disposal. In the opinion of the IAEA, solid or
packaged radioactive wastes should not be dumped into shallow
waters because of the risk of accidental recovery of the
material. The Recommendations are, therefore, limited to deep sea
dumping.<A HREF="#delete">*</A>
<P>         
2.7.2. In addition to the movement of the radioactivity through
ecosystems, other factors have to be taken into consideration in
assessing the acceptability of a proposed dumping operation. The
concern, in particular, the conditioning of the waste in order
to ensure safe transport and handling and the risk of an
accidental recovery of <I>packaged waste</I> after dumping. This
is covered by operational measures dealing with the design  and
construction of waste containers, <I>the required forms of solid
waste (see paragraph 2.9.4.4)</I>, the choice of a suitable
dumping site, the choice of an appropriate ship able to dispose
of the  waste in the given dumping site, provisions for radiation
protection of the creu and an adequate supervision of the dumping
operations by competent escorting officers. All these operational
measures should, therefore, be included in the special permits
issued by the appropriate national authorities in accordance with
the Convention.
<P>         
2.8.    <I>Factors Affecting the Choice of a Dumping Site</I>
<P>         
2.8.1. In the selection of marine areas to be utilized as dumping
sites for packaged wastes, consideration must be given primarily
to the factors affecting the safety of man and his environment
and secondly to economic considerations.
<P>         
2.8.2. In general, the first step in an evaluation will involve
the selection from a number of possible sites of those apparently
most suited for safe disposal of packaged or solid wastes. Among
the factors which must be considered in such a site selection
are:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(1) The probability of accidental recovery of packaged or
solid waste by man. A site would not be suitable for packaged or
solid waste disposal unless it were highly improbable that
accidental recovery would occur; the selection of shallow waters
for dumping is therefore considered to be unacceptable;
<P>         
<DD>(2) The possible utilization of the sea-bed site by man
directly in the harvest of marine products, or indirectly in the
use made of the area by organisms which are harvested by man for
food in adjacent areas;
<P>         
<DD>(3) The nature of bottom sediments with respect to the uptake
of the activity from the water and impact damage to packages;
<P>         
<DD>(4) Transport by deep-sea currents from the dumping site with
particular concern for the shoreward-directed flow;
<P>         
<DD>(5) Rate of turbulent diffusion in the waters <I>in the
vicinity</I> of the dumping site;
<P>        
<DD>(6) Rate of exchange of waters of the particular marine
sub-division containing the dumping site with other sub-divisions
of the marine environment.
</DL>
<P>         
2.8.3. It is evident that dumping sites must be selected in areas
not used for bottom trawling or other types of bottom fishing and
which are unsuited for future utilization. Areas crossed by
sub-marine cables in current use are likewise undesirable. In
general, dumping sites located in the deep sea should be in areas
where there is a low rate of exchange of the deep waters with the
surface layers and with the waters of any adjacent continental
shelf. Thus, sub-marine canyons located on the edge of the
continental shelf are generally less suited for dumping sites
than the deep waters in the true ocean basins, since the deep
waters of the canyons more readily exchange with the waters of
the continental shelf. As regions of deep convection exist to the
poleward side of the major oceanic gyres, these requirements are
best satisfied by the selection of sites in water having depths
of 4000 m or more situated between latitudes 50<SUP>o</SUP>N and
50<SUP>o</SUP>S. Sites
should be located clear of continental margins and open sea
islands and not in marginal or inland seas. Nor should they be
situated in known areas of natural phenomena, for example
volcanic activity; that would make such a site unsuitable for
dumping.
<P>         
2.8.4.   The importance of the sea and sea bed for resource
development in the future can hardly be seen in accurate
perspective today. They are likely however to be used on an
increasing scale to obtain the mineral and food resources needed
by mankind. Before selecting a dumping site studies should
therefore be carried out to assess possible future resource
development in the area concerned. The conduct of such studies
could well be co-ordinated by an appropriate international
organization. It would also seem desirable  to agree
internationally to approved dumping sites. Concern about the
future exploitation of the sea would also make it prudent to keep
the total number of dumping sites as limited as practicable.
<P>         
2.9.    <I>Special Requirements for Packages for Dumping</I>
<P>         
2.9.1. General
<P>         
2.9.1.1. It is essential that packages of radioactive matter
permitted to be dumped under the provisions of the Convention
meet certain minimal requirements to ensure that the packages may
be handled and transported safely and that upon immersion the
waste materials reach the sea bed without being released.
<P>         
2.9.1.2. When dealing with radioactive waste of the levels that
may be permitted to be dumped the protection of man and the
marine environment does not depend upon the long-term integrity
of the packaging. However, packages so designed that their
contents are retained during descent to the sea bed will
generally remain intact for a period of time after they have
reached the bottom. The packages will, however, eventually
release some or all of their radioactive contents. When
considering whether to issue a special permit for a specific site
the appropriate national authorities should ensure that the
concentration of radioactivity in the vicinity of the package
does not present any unacceptable risk to man or the marine
ecosystem.
<P>
2.9.1.3. To meet essential packaging requirements the
considerations set forth in paragraphs 2.9.2 to 2.9.8.2
below apply.
<P>         
2.9.2. Conditioning
<P>         
2.9.2.1. The radioactive waste within the packages should be in a
form which, even in the case of containers which may be damaged
or corroded, will as far as possible prevent a release and
subsequent spreading of the radioactive material; this is
particularly important to ensure safe handling and transport.
Therefore, it is essential that the radioactive  waste permitted
to be dumped be in a form either solid, solidified or absorbed
on a solid. The waste may be incorporated into a solid packaged
matrix such as cement, concrete or bitumen, forming a single
block (monolithic design of the package) or packaged separately
and assembled in a concrete vessel or a metal drum (multistage
design of the overall package). Liquid wastes should be excluded.
However, small quantities of liquids such as tritiated water may
be absorbed on a material of good absorption capacity and then
dumped as packages containing solid substrate.
<P>         
2.9.3. Transport
<P>         
2.9.3.1. The transport of radioactive  waste should be in
accordance with the IAEA Transport
Regulations<A HREF="#note11">[11]</A> and any other
applicable international and national transport regulations, in
particular when the radioactive waste has other hazardous
characteristics such as explosiveness, innammability,
pyrophoricity, chemical toxicity and corrosiveness. The IAEA
Transport Regulations include provisions for special
arrangements when the package design or shipment conditions do
not comply in all respects with the standard requirements. This
system of special arrangements is the one most likely to be used
for dealing with the transport of waste for dumping.
<P>         
2.9.4. Packaging Materials
<P>         
2.9.4.1. It can be expected that packages containing radioactive
waste will be made of dense material and that they will be made
strong enough for safe handling. For the purpose of dumping it
may be desirable to have the additional quality of some
resistance to attack by sea-water.
<P>         
2.9.4.2. Steel drums are frequently used for forming concrete
containers and both the concrete and the steel can be regarded as
protective. It is desirable that concrete used in packaging be of
good quality and of low porosity if it is intended to resist
breakage on impact with the sea bed and to withstand the
destructive action of sea-water. It should not be regarded merely
as weighting material. When concrete alone is used the thickness
of the concrete between the  waste and the outer surface should
be sufficient to prevent rupture of the package on impact if this
is required. Other suitable material can be used to provide the
needed weight.
<P>         
2.9.4.3. Baled radioactive waste which is not provided with a
containment system should not be dumped.
<P>         
2.9.4.4. Some forms of waste material are such that radioactivity
is intrinsically well contained within the waste form itself
(e.g. a metal matrix in which induced activity is fixed). When it
can be shown that wastes in such forms will reach the ocean bed
intact without dispersion of their radionuclide contents they
should be considered to conform to the requirements for the
dumping of packaged solid radioactive waste.

<P>         
2.9.5. Specific Gravity
<P>         
2.9.5.1  All packaged <I>solid radioactive</I> waste disposed of
into the sea must be sufficiently dense to sink immediately.
This condition should not be difficult to meet since the specific
gravity of sea-water at sea level does not exceed about 1.03
However, precautions must be taken to see that the contents of a
broken package will not rise to the surface. It is expected that
light materials, such as cloth and paper, would be incorporated
into concrete within the outer protective containment system, and
the overall specific gravity of all packages disposed of in deep
waters would not be less than 1.2. Packages and their contents
should be sufficiently dense to ensure that they are not readily
moved along the sea bed by currents. Should inner containers be
incorporated into the principal container the design must be such
that they will remain on the sea bed.
<P>         
2.9.6. Voids
<P>         
2.9.6.1. If a package containing voids or compressible materials
is dumped in deep water it will collapse due to the hydrostatic
pressure unless there is provision for equalizing the pressure
between interior and exterior, or the container is made
sufficiently strong or pliable to retain its contents under the
pressure encountered during descent to the sea bed.
<P>         
2.9.7. Strength against Impact
<P>         
2.9.7.1. Packaged wastes will suffer impact at the surface of the
sea and again when they hit the bottom. Designers should take
this into account.
<P>         
2.9.8. Contents
<P>         
2.9.8.1. Material in the package should comply with the relevant
criteria and conditions set forth in the Annexes to the
Convention.
<P>         
2.9.8.2. The package should exclude buoyant material unless it is
treated or packaged so as either to preclude the return of such
material to surface waters or to ensure that, on its return, it
will not constitute a radiation hazard nor interfere materially
with fishing, navigation or other legitimate uses of the sea.
Among the materials which might thus be disposed of polyethylene
is one of the few which are permanently buoyant and which thus
present a special risk of return to the surface, especially when
used in the form of closed bottles. The presence of polyethylene
in containers for dumping would be acceptable only in the
following cases:
<P>
<DL>         
<DD>(a) When thin polyethylene sheeting is used to protect the
inside surface of the containers against corrosion;
<P>         
<DD>(b) When the material is processed, for example by shredding,
granulating, or cutting into small Fragments; and
<P>         
<DD>(c) Where it can be guaranteed that the specific gravity of
an inner polyethylene container and its contents is not less than
1.2, provided the contents have been solidified by an acceptable
method (e. g. with cement).
</DL>
<P>         
2.10. <I>International Co-operation and Observation</I>
<P>         
2.10.1. The IAEA welcomes the undertaking provided for by Article
VIII of the Convention with respect to the conclusion of regional
agreements for the prevention of pollution, especially by
dumping. This seems particularly necessary in considering
environmental monitoring and the need for the appropriate
national authorities to be aware of the sites used and the
quantities disposed of in the dumping carried out by other   
States, as discussed in paragraph 2.6.1 above.
<P>         
2.10.2. International co-operation in the selection of dumping
sites and international observation of dumping operations have
been suggested. International or multilateral observation is
considered desirable to establish to the satisfaction of all
parties concerned that dumping involving radioactive materials is
carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Convention
and the Definition and Recommendations of the IAEA. For
instance, such observation is provided for under the Multilateral
Consultation and Surveillance Mechanism for Sea Dumping of
Radioactive Waste, established within the framework of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on 22 July
1977.

</CENTER>
<P>         
Nuclear material subject or required to be subject to safeguards
under this Agreement which is transferred internationally shall,
for purposes of this Agreement, be regarded as being the
responsibility of the Government of Sweden:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) In the case of import into Sweden, from the time that
such responsibility ceases to lie with the exporting State, and
no later than the time at which the material reaches its
destination; and

</DL>
<P>         
The point at which the transfer of responsibility will take place
shall be determined in accordance with suitable arrangements to
be made by the States concerned. Neither Sweden nor any other
State shall be deemed to have such responsibility for nuclear
material merely by reason of the fact that the nuclear material
is in transit on or over its territory, or that it is being
transported on a ship under its flag or in its aircraft.

<CENTER><H3>Communication Received from the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics
Regarding the Treaty
for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
On 8 June 1978 the Director General received a note dated 6 June
from the Resident
Representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the
International Organizations
in Vienna in which he communicated the text of a statement made
by the Soviet Union on the
occasion of the signing of Additional Protocol II to the 
<A HREF="bginf179.html">Treaty</A> for the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons in Latin America <I>[United Nations Treaty Series, Vol,
634, No, 9068]</I> in
Moscow on 18 May. In accordance with the request made
by the Resident Representative of the Soviet Union the texts of
his note and of the attached
statement are reproduced below. <I>[Unofficial translation by the
Agency's Secretariat.]</I>
<p>
<hr noshade size=1 width=40%>
<p>
I have the honour to inform you that the signing of Additional
Protocol II to the
Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
(the Tlatelolco
Treaty) by the Soviet Union took place in Moscow on 18 May 1978.
This important
and constructive step was taken by the Soviet Union in conformity
with its basic policy
of working to reduce the threat of nuclear war.
<P>         
Additional Protocol II was signed on behalf of the Soviet Union
by
Mr. A.A. Gromyko, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. A statement,
the text of
which is attached, was made at the signing.
<P>         
I would request that you arrange for the distribution of the text
of this note
together with that of the above-mentioned statement as an
official Agency document.
<P>
<CENTER>
STATEMENT
</CENTER>
<P>         
made at the signing of Additional Protocol II to the Treaty for
the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (the Tlatelolco Treaty) by the
Soviet Union.
<P>
As a consistent advocate of the establishment of nuclear-free
zones in various
parts of the world and desiring to support the efforts of the
Latin American States
along these lines, the Soviet Government has decided to sign
Additional Protocol II
to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin
America (the Tlatelolco
Treaty).
<P>
In signing Additional Protocol II to the Tlatelolco Treaty, the
Government of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics deems it necessary to state
the following:
<OL>
<LI>The Soviet Union proceeds from the assumption that the effect
of Article 1
of the Treaty extends, as specified in Article 5 of the Treaty,
to any nuclear explosive
device and that, accordingly, the carrying out by any party to
the Treaty of explosions
of nuclear devices for peaceful purposes would be a violation of
its obligations under
Article 1 and would be incompatible with its non-nuclear status,
For States parties
to the Treaty, a solution to the problem of peaceful nuclear
explosions can be found in
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and within the framework of the international
procedures of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
<P>
<LI>In signing Additional Protocol II, the Soviet Union proceeds
from the
assumption that at present the zone of application of the Treaty
comprises the
territories for which it is in force as provided in Article 4(1)
of the Treaty. The
signing of Additional Protocol II by the Soviet Union does not in
any way signify
recognition of the possibility of the force of the Treaty as
provided in Article 4(2)
being extended beyond the territories of the States parties to
the Treaty, including
air space and territorial waters as defined in accordance with
international law.
<P>
<LI>With regard to the reference in Article 3 of the Treaty to
"its own
legislation" in connection with the territorial waters, air space
and any other
space over which the States parties to the Treaty exercise
sovereignty, the
signing of Additional Protocol II by the Soviet Union does not
signify recognition
of their claims to the exercise of sovereignty which are contrary
to generally
accepted standards of international law.
<P>         
<LI>The Soviet Union takes note of the interpretation of the
Treaty given in the
Final Act of the Preparatory Commission for the Denuclearization
of Latin America
to the effect that the transport of nuclear weapons by the
parties to the Treaty is
covered by the prohibitions envisaged in Article 1 of the Treaty.
<P>         
<LI>The Final Act of the Preparatory Commission for the
Denuclearization of
Latin America includes an interpretation of the Treaty to the
effect that the granting
of permission for the transit of nuclear weapons at the request
of States not parties
to the Treaty lies within the competence of each individual State
party to the Treaty.
In this connection the Soviet Union reaffirms its position that
authorizing the transit
of nuclear weapons in any form would be contrary to the
objectives of the Treaty,
according to which, as specially mentioned in the Preamble, Latin
America must be
completely free from nuclear weapons, and that it would be
incompatible with the
non-nuclear status of the States parties to the Treaty and with
their obligations as
laid down in Article 1 thereof.
<P>
<LI>Any actions undertaken by a State party to, or States parties
to, the
Tlatelolco Treaty which are not compatible with their non-nuclear
status, and also
the commission by one or more States parties to the Treaty of an
act of aggression
with the support of a State which is in possession of nuclear
weapons or together with
such a State, will be regarded by the Soviet Union as
incompatible with the obligations
of those countries under the Treaty. In such cases the Soviet
Union reserves the right
to reconsider its obligations under Additional Protocol II.
<P>         
The Soviet Union further reserves the right to reconsider its
attitude to
Additional Protocol II in the event of any actions on the part of
other States possessing
nuclear weapons which are incompatible with their obligations
under the said Protocol.
<P>
<LI>The Soviet Government states that the provisions of the
articles of Additional
Protocol II are applicable to the text of the Treaty for the
Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons in Latin America in the wording of the Treaty at the time
of the signing of
the Protocol by the Government of the Soviet Union, due account
being taken of the
position of the Soviet Union as set out in the present statement.
In this connection,
any amendment to the Treaty entering into force in accordance
with the provisions
of Articles 29 and 6 of the Treaty without the clearly expressed
approval of the Soviet
Union shall have no force as far as the Soviet Union is
concerned.

<LI>The safeguards referred to in Article 8 shall in respect of
each Party be applied by the IAEA as set forth in an agreement
negotiated and concluded with the IAEA on all source or special
fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within
the
territory of the Party, under its jurisdiction or carried out
under
its control anywhere.
<P>         
<LI>The agreement referred to in paragraph l shall be, or shall
be
equivalent in its scope and effect to, an agreement required in
connection with the NPT on the basis of the material reproduced
in
document INFCIRC/153 (Corrected) of the IAEA. Each Party shall
take
all appropriate steps to ensure that such an agreement is in
force
for it not later than 18 months after the date of entry into
force
for that Party of this Treaty.
<P>         
<LI>For the purposes of this Treaty, the safeguards referred to
in
paragraph 1 shall have as their purpose the verification of the
non-diversion of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear
activities
to nuclear explosive devices.
<P>         
<LI>Each Party agrees upon the request of any other Party to
transmit to that Party and to the Director for the information of
all Parties a copy of the overall conclusions of the most recent
report by the IAEA on its inspection activities in the territory
of
the Party concerned, and to advise the Director promptly of
any subsequent findings of the Board of Governors of the IAEA in

COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>   
<OL>      
<LI>A Party which considers that there are grounds for a
complaint
that another Party is in breach of its obligations under this
Treaty shall, before bringing such a complaint to the Director,
bring the subject matter of the complaint to the attention of the
Party complained of and shall allow the latter reasonable
opportunity to provide it with an explanation and to resolve the
matter.
<P>         
<LI>If the matter is not so resolved, the complainant Party may
bring the complaint to the Director with a request that the
Consultative Committee be convened to consider it. Complaints
shall
be supported by an account of evidence of breach of obligations
known to the complainant Party. Upon receipt of a complaint the
Director shall convene the Consultative Committee as quickly as
possible to consider it.
<P>         
<LI>The Consultative Committee, taking account of efforts made
under paragraph 1 shall afford the Party complained of a
reasonable
opportunity to provide it with an explanation of the matter.
<P>         
<LI>If, after considering any explanation given to it by the
representatives of the Party complained of, the Consultative
Committee decides that there is sufficient substance in the
complaint to warrant a special inspection in the territory of
that
Party or elsewhere, the Consultative Committee shall direct that
such special inspection be made as quickly as possible by a
special
inspection team of three suitably qualified special inspectors
appointed by the Consultative Committee in consultation with the
complained of and complainant Parties, provided that no national
of
either Party shall serve on the special inspection team. If so
requested by the Party complained of, the special inspection team
shall be accompanied by representatives of that Party. Neither
the
right of consultation on the appointment of special inspectors,
nor
the right to accompany special inspectors, shall delay the work
of
the special
inspection team.
<P>         
<LI>In making a special inspection, special inspectors shall be
subject to the direction only of the Consultative Committee and
shall comply with such directives concerning tasks, objectives,
confidentiality and procedures as may be decided upon by it.
Directives shall take account of the legitimate interests of the
Party complained of in complying with its other international
obligations and commitments and shall not duplicate safeguards
procedures to be undertaken by the IAEA pursuant to agreements
referred to in Annex 2 (1). The special inspectors shall
discharge
their duties with due respect for the laws of the Party
complained
of.
<P>         
<LI>Each Party shall give to special inspectors full and free
access to all information and places within its territory which
may
be relevant to enable the special inspectors to implement the
directives given to them by the Consultative Committee.
<P>         
<LI>The Party complained of shall take all appropriate steps to
facilitate the special inspection and shall grant to special
inspectors privileges and immunities necessary for the
performance
of their functions, including inviolability for all papers and
documents and immunity from arrest, detention and legal process
for
acts done and words spoken and written, for the purpose of the
special inspection.
<P>         
<LI>The special inspectors shall report in writing as quickly as
possible to the Consultative Committee, outlining their
activities,
setting out relevant facts and information as ascertained by
them,
with supporting evidence and documentation as appropriate, and
stating their conclusions. The Consultative
Committee shall report fully to all Members of the South Pacific
Forum, giving its decision as to whether the Party complained of
is
in breach of its obligations under this Treaty.
<P>         
<LI>If the Consultative Committee has decided that the Party
complained of is in breach of its obligations under this Treaty,
or
that the above provisions have not been complied with, or at any
time at the request of either the complainant or complained of
Party, the Parties shall meet promptly at a meeting of the South
Pacific Forum.

Movement of Radioactive Waste</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>         
On 21 September 1990, the General Conference, by resolution    
GC(XXXIV)/RES/530, adopted a Code of Practice on the
International Transboundary Movement of Radioactive Waste and
requested the Director General - <I>inter alia</I> - to take all
necessary steps to ensure wide dissemination of the Code of
Practice at both the national and the international level.
<P>         
The Code of Practice was elaborated by a Group of Experts
established pursuant to resolution GC(XXXII)/RES/490 adopted by
the General Conference in 1988.
<P>         
The text of the Code of Practice is reproduced herewith for the

accordance with the receiving State's consent that the above   
requirement is met prior to the international transboundary
movement of
<P>         
<LI>Every State should take the appropriate steps to introduce
into its national laws and regulations relevant provisions as
necessary for liability, compensation or other remedies for
damage that could arise from the international transboundarY

<CENTER><H3>Declaration by the Presidents of Argentina and Brazil
on the 25th
Anniversary of the Signing of the Treaty of Tlatelolco</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
The attached text of a declaration made by the Presidents of
Argentina
and Brazil on 14 February 1992 at a special meeting of the Agency
for the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (OPANAL) held in
Mexico City
to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty
for the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (the <A
HREF="bginf179.html">Tlatelolco Treaty</A>) is
being circulated for the information of Member States at the
request of the
Resident Representatives of Argentina and Brazil.

<CENTER>
<B>DECLARATION BY THE PRESIDENTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA AND
THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL ON THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF
THE SIGNING OF THE TREATY OF TLATELOLCO</B>
</CENTER>
<P>         
Since assuming the office of President in our two countries we
have given
a fresh and powerful impetus to the adoption of a common nuclear
policy, among
other things in questions relating to non-proliferation. We have
always been
prompted by the aim of endowing our nuclear programmes with both
internal and
external transparency and of demonstrating to the international
community the
exclusively peaceful objectives which guide them, in conformity
with the
spirit of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the 25th anniversary of which
we are
celebrating today.
<P>         
That programme reflects the determination and the political will
of our
Governments to strengthen regional and international peace and
security, among
other things through the adoption of clear verification
mechanisms.
<P>         
In that context we agreed, in the Declaration on Common Nuclear
Policy
signed on 28 November 1990 at Foz do Igua&ccedil;u, on three
concrete steps:
<DL>
<DD>- The establishment of a Common System of Accounting and
Control of
Nuclear Materials;
<P>
<DD>- The conclusion of a joint safeguards agreement with the
International Atomic Energy Agency; and
<P>
<DD>- The adoption of pertinent measures leading to the full
entry into
force for both countries of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, including
whatever steps are necessary to update and improve the text of
the
Treaty.
</DL>
<P>         
The international community has been witness to the speed and
efficiency
with which these goals were achieved. The results are familiar to
all:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- The Agreement between Argentina and Brazil for the
Exclusively
Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy, signed on 18 July 1991 in the
city
of Guadalajara, which has already been approved by the Congresses
of our two countries and ratified by the two Governments. This
Agreement reflects the practical achievement of the first step;
and
<P>
<DD>- The signature on 13 December 1991 of the Agreement between
Argentina, Brazil, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting
and Control of Nuclear Materials and the International Atomic
Energy Agency for the application of safeguards.
</DL>
<P>         
Today we are taking effective steps to fulfil the third and final
commitment mentioned in the Foz do Igua&ccedil;u Declaration. As
soon as possible
we shall be submitting for the consideration of OPANAL a number
of amendments to
the text of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, amendments which are highly
technical in
nature and which in no way affect the principles and objectives
of the Treaty.
<P>         
We ask all the countries of our region to grant us the support
necessary to make this initiative successful, since its aim is to
facilitate
application of the Treaty.
<P>         
We congratulate the Government of France on its decision to
ratify
Additional Protocol I to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, a step which
should, we
hope in the near future, establish definitively its legal force
for the whole
region for which it is intended.
<P>         
All these recent developments, which point to the profound desire
shared by all of us to consolidate Latin America and the
Caribbean as a zone
free of nuclear weapons, have led us to the common conviction
that completion
of the process just referred to of approving amendments to the
text of the
Treaty will definitively open the way to its entry into force in
our countries.
<P>         
In this way Argentina and Brazil are contributing clearly and
positively to the establishment of a new international climate
characterized
by co-operation and by the creation of confidence among nations
as central
elements in the preservation of peace and international security.

VIII SPECIAL SESSION OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE OF OPANAL
<P>         
STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR CARLOS PORTALES CIFUENTES,
DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR FOREIGN POLICY
ON THE OCCASION OF CHILE'S BECOMING A
CONTRACTING PARTY TO THE TLATELOLCO TREATY</B>
<BR>
(Mexico City, 18 January 1994)
</CENTER>
<P>         
It is my privilege to head the first Chilean delegation
participating in a meeting of this
General Conference after the action taken by my country to become
a full Contracting Party
to the Tlatelolco Treaty and to become a member of the Agency for
the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (OPANAL).
<P>         
This is an occasion of special importance and significance for
Chile. I therefore have
the great honor of transmitting to the distinguished delegates
participating in this meeting,
to the Secretariat of OPANAL and, in particular, to the
delegation of the Government of
Mexico, depositary of this international instrument, cordial and
fraternal greetings from his
Excellency, the President of the Republic of Chile, Mr. Patricio
Aylwin Az&oacute;car.
<P>         
I should like to recall that Chile has been closely associated
with the establishment
of the Tlatelolco system from the outset, as evidenced by the
joint statement by the Heads
of State of Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and Chile, whose
Declaration on the
Denuclearization of Latin America of 29 April 1963 was supported
by the United Nations
General Assembly in resolution 1911 (XVIII). Having signed and
ratified the original
Treaty, we had an obligation to promote its aims and to refrain
from engaging in any acts
contrary to its objectives. Nevertheless, Chile still had to give
a further demonstration of
its political will in order to become a full member of the
system. This step was taken when
we solemnly deposited the declaration waiving the requirements
set forth in paragraph 1 of
Article 28 that have not yet been fulfilled and, in addition,
ratified all the amendments
approved to date by the meetings of signatories.
<P>         
The reform of 1992 represents a concrete example of what can be
achieved in the
region when there is common political will, a more imaginative
attitude and a clear desire
for a fresh approach and further progress. This joint initiative
is a response to the efforts
made during the last 25 years by the States party to the
Tlatelolco Treaty and by the
successive Secretaries General of OPANAL aimed at completing the
establishment of the first
inhabited nuclear-weapon-free zone in the world. In this
connection, I should like to
highlight the role played by Mexico as depositary State.
<P>         
The invitation extended by President Aylwin to the Heads of State
of Argentina and
Brazil to move jointly towards full implementation of the
Tlatelolco Treaty and its "zone of
application" undoubtedly marked the beginning of one of the most
important diplomatic
initiatives in which Chile has been involved during the last few
years. It is a reflection of
Chile's desire to participate actively in the design and
improvement of the schemes and
instruments that contribute to international security, through
both regional and international
actions.
<P>         
With these specific steps, the Chilean Government has sought to
emphasize its total
renunciation and repudiation of the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and to
demonstrate its commitment to making a major contribution to the
advancement of this cause.
In the light of the new challenges posed by international
developments, we have begun to
take steps towards seriously evaluating our commitments with
regard to security and giving
thorough consideration to promoting the cause of disarmament.
<P>         
We are endeavouring to adopt a fresh approach in our efforts to
make an effective and
imaginative contribution to the establishment of a genuine system
of security and we are
ready to undertake new commitments in this area. These include
other initiatives designed
to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in
particular the Mendoza
Declaration, the signing of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the
improvement of the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention and the withdrawal of the
reservation maintained by Chile
since 1935 with respect to the Geneva Protocol for the
Prohibition of the Use in War of
Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological
Methods of Warfare.
<P>         
We should therefore like to see the gradual, natural
incorporation of Chile in the main
forums related to this subject. That is why we have promoted the
holding of a regional
conference on confidence and security measures and have offered
to host the next regular
session of OPANAL's General Conference.
<P>         
We hope that our region will become a place of peace and mutual
confidence, where
uncertainties will disappear and a spirit of understanding will
prevail. The indisputable fact
that Latin America is at present one of the most peaceful regions
of the world gives us new
hope that the contribution which we are making to the cause of
peace and security is both
necessary and relevant. It compels us to continue to move forward
by undertaking new
commitments and by improving the existing instruments.
<P>         
The latest international developments present major challenges
for world security.
On the one hand, there have been significant advances brought
about by the conclusion of
the START I and II Treaties, the adoption of the Chemical Weapons
Convention, the
announcements of unilateral moratoriums on nuclear tests, the
improvements in the systems
for the control of military and dual-use technology, the
development of the inspection
capabilities of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the
establishment of the United
Nations Register of Conventional Arms. These all constitute
achievements of historic
significance in terms of their extensive cover. On the other
hand, new systems of security
are also being established, with varying degrees of
effectiveness, offering ways of finding
negotiated solutions to regional conflicts.
<P>
In other areas, much still remains to be done: there are still
threats of proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and, in a framework of growing
interdependence, science and
technology, while opening up promising avenues towards progress,
paradoxically also
facilitate access to new methods of annihilation. Chile is
convinced that today, more than
ever before, there is a need to adopt a comprehensive and
integrated approach to the problem
of weapons of mass destruction through balanced and
non-discriminatory multilateral
agreements. The comprehensive nature of such agreements should
facilitate the integration
of all the actors on the international scene in genuinely
universal agreements which would
serve as deterrents and would not impede access to the full
development of advanced dual-use
technologies for exclusively peaceful purposes. These principles
should provide guidance
for the improvement of other disarmament agreements in the area
of weapons of mass
destruction at regional and global level. It should be noted that
the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use
of Chemical Weapons and
on Their Destruction establishes standards similar to those laid
down in the Tlatelolco Treaty,
with additional provisions suited to the specialized nature of
the subject involved. Chile
attaches particular importance to the concept of challenge
inspections, which are now
enshrined for the first time in an international treaty and whose
progressive development we
have also promoted in the International Atomic Energy Agency.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>        
Mr. President,
</DL>
<P>         
The reforms to the Tlatelolco control regime have created a
graded, integrated and
balanced structure, which begins with reports by the Parties and
proceeds with the
requirement for special reports. If no satisfactory response is
provided, these reports are
followed by a request for a special inspection, for whose
implementation the International
Atomic Energy Agency is responsible and which has to be carried
out in accordance with
Article 12 of the Tlatelolco Treaty. By means of these
inspections, the IAEA has to verify
the whole scope of compliance with the commitments undertaken by
the Contracting Parties.
In our view this means that, in accordance with Article 19,
OPANAL and the IAEA should
conclude a new agreement, authorized by the General Conference,
to "facilitate the efficient
operation of the control system".
<P>
The way in which the Tlatelolco Treaty and its Additional
Protocols have evolved
indicates the course we should adopt in order to generate and
strengthen a climate of greater
confidence and security between our countries. Although the
Treaty was conceived at a very
different time to the present one, we can see today that it has
lost nothing of its validity and
relevance. Its progressive nature has made it possible to extend
its scope without weakening
the commitments already undertaken. Its flexibility has made it
easier for major powers to
join the regime for the prohibition of nuclear weapons enshrined
in it. The spirit and letter
of the Treaty present to the rest of the world a vital wealth of
principles and standards,
prominent among which are the extensive and comprehensive nature
of the Treaty's
provisions and the concept of a mechanism for the effective
international control of nuclear
disarmament, which was both original and ahead of its time.
<P>
The notion of "nuclear-weapon-free zone" promoted by the
Tlatelolco Treaty is based
on the premise that the commitments undertaken have identical
significance with regard to
all the parties involved and, in this respect, goes far beyond
the concept of non-proliferation.
The objective of a definitive and complete prohibition of all
types of nuclear weapon is one
that should be shared by the whole of humanity. To achieve this
objective, we must first
strengthen the Tlatelolco Treaty's zone of application to cover
the whole area; contribute to
the establishment with adjacent regions covered by the Antarctic
Treaty and the Rarotonga
Treaty of an extensive system of peace; and watch sympathetically
the process of the
creation of similar zones in regions where, as in the case of
Africa, negotiations for the
establishment of denuclearized zones have already begun.
<P>         
In resolution ll(I), OPANAL's General Conference invited the
Director General of
the IAEA to prepare a safeguards project which could serve as the
basis for the negotiation
of the agreements provided for in Article 13 of the Treaty. In
accordance with the spirit and
practice of the Tlatelolco Treaty, such agreements should be
full-scope, prohibit any military
purpose and help to ensure that the parties comply with their
obligations. The Chilean
Government has already initiated the exchange of information
which should lead to the
negotiation of a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA
so as to ensure
compliance with Article 13 of the Tlatelolco Treaty within the
stipulated time-limits.
<P>         
It is common knowledge that the denuclearization established by
the Tlatelolco Treaty
is limited to military purposes. Therefore, any peaceful use of
nuclear energy, in other
words, any use for non-military purposes, is permitted and
constitutes an inalienable right
of each State. In the case of the Tlatelolco Treaty, this is
specifically recognized in
Article 17.
<P>         
Within this reference framework, we regard with great interest
the future role which
could be given to OPANAL as an appropriate organization to assume
responsibility for the
regional co-ordination of the exercise of its members' rights "in
conformity with this Treaty,
to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in particular for
their economic development and
social progress". As the former Secretary General, Mr. Antonio
Stempel Paris, had occasion
to point out, OPANAL could extend its range of activities to this
sphere and adopt a
substantially different course to that pursued hitherto.
<P>         
We should recall that already in 1977 the members of OPANAL
indicated their desire
for it to be involved in the planning, systematization,
organization and co-ordination at
regional level of Latin American efforts to ensure the full and
effective peaceful use of
nuclear energy. The member countries now have the political will
to achieve this objective.
In order to do so, OPANAL should be given the necessary resources
and clear, specific
functions establishing it as a regional organ responsible for the
co-ordination of the peaceful
uses of nuclear energy.
<P>         
At its session in May 1993, OPANAL's General Conference approved
a resolution
which included a set of measures directed towards this end. We
are looking forward to the
evaluation report which the OPANAL Council has been requested to
provide for the
XIV session period in 1995, and to the Secretary General's
proposals for promoting
co-operation in the training of scientists in the region,
including co-operation with institutions
and universities of developed countries.

<P>         
Chile began to take the first initiatives in the area of nuclear
research in the 1950s
It participated in the first international meeting on the
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which
took place in Geneva, and participated in the adoption of the
Statute of the IAEA, of which
Chile became a member in 1960.
<P>         
Later, in 1964, the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission was set up
as an autonomous
administrative organization responsible for all matters related
to the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy and nuclear-related materials in order to ensure
integrated development in this field.
<P>         
The Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission has two basic functions: to
promote the
development of the peaceful uses and applications of nuclear
energy, and to control those
applications in order to protect human life and health, goods and
the environment. In
carrying out these functions, the Commission has co-operated
closely and continuously with
the IAEA. Of particular importance in this context are the
projects implemented under the
Regional Co-operative Arrangements for the Promotion of Nuclear
Science and Technology
in Latin America (ARCAL).
<P>         
It is important to stress Chile's interest in the development of
nuclear technologies in
areas such as medicine, the study of structures and parts, the
measurement and analysis of
natural and industrial processes, food preservation, treatment of
waste and others too
numerous to list.
<P>         
We are sure that our role as a full member of OPANAL will not
only open up
possibilities for horizontal co-operation in the peaceful use of
nuclear energy, but will also
put us in a better position for fulfilling our commitments in the
area of peace,
non-proliferation, security and, hence, disarmament.
<P>         
With the lifting of the threat of nuclear proliferation in our
region, the time has come
to strengthen and promote the system which has made this notable
achievement possible.
Chile is taking up this challenge enthusiastically. We will
tackle the remaining tasks with
the same decisiveness and determination that characterized the
action which has led to our
presence here today.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>         
Thank you very much.

conduct of review meetings. It is understood that this document
is not exhaustive and does not bind the Contracting Parties to
the Convention on Nuclear Safety.

In accordance with Article 5 of the Convention, national reports
should, as applicable, address each obligation separately. The
reports should demonstrate how each obligation has been met, with
specific references to - <I>inter alia</I> - legislation,
procedures and design criteria. When a report states that a
particular obligation has not been met, that report should also
state what measures are being taken or planned to meet that
obligation.
<P>         
3. Conduct of review meetings
<P>         
the purpose of review meetings referred to in Article 20 of the

concerns in order to ensure efficient and fruitful debate at the
meetings; and
<P>         
<DD>* identify technical information and opportunities for
technical cooperation in the interest of resolving safety
problems identified.
</DL>
<P>         
4. Rules of Procedure for the meeting of the Parties
<P>         
4.1 Equitable representation: Paramount importance should be
given to technical competence in the election of chairmen and
officers. Consideration should also be given to the overall
membership of the Convention, including the geographical
distribution of the Contracting Parties.
<P>         
4.2 Decision-making: Every effort should be made to take
decisions by consensus.
<P>

5. Financial rules
<P>         
5.1 Costs to the secretariat: All costs to the secretariat,
referred to in Article 28 of the Convention, should be kept to a
minimum. The Agency should be requested to provide other services
in support of the meeting of the Contracting Parties, only if
such services are deemed essential.
<P>
5.2 Costs to the Contracting Parties: In order to encourage the
widest possible adherence to the Convention, the costs of

<DL>
<DD>         
* limiting the frequency of review meetings; and
<P>         
<DD>* limiting the duration of the preparatory meeting and of
review meetings.

<CENTER>
<I>Declaration</I>
</CENTER>
<P>                           
"The Government of the Republic of Cuba declares that the obstacles which have until
now prevented the Republic of Cuba from becoming a full party to the Treaty for the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean remain and continue
seriously to affect Cuban security. The only nuclear Power in this part of the world, the
United States of America, is maintaining a policy of hostility towards Cuba; it is intensifying
its economic, commercial and financial blockade, reinforcing its campaign against the country
and maintaining by force and against the will of our people the illegal occupation of part of
the national territory, through which even ships carrying nuclear weapons pass, a problem
whose solution will in the future have to be considered a condition for our country to stay
within this Treaty".

<B>Statement by Minister Robaina at the Tlatelolco Treaty
Signing Ceremony</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Your Excellency the Minister of External Relations of Mexico,
<P>
Members of the Mexican delegation attending,
<P>
Guests and compatriots,
<P>
Cuba, once again, is showing the world that it is true to its commitments. On this
occasion, in signing the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and
the Caribbean, also known as the Tlatelolco Treaty, the Government of Cuba is honouring
an undertaking made by President Fidel Castro Ruz on the occasion of the First American
Summit in Guadalajara.
<P>
This step should be viewed as further proof of our country s desire to integrate fully
into the Latin American and Caribbean community, and as confirmation of our confidence
in the future of that united Latin America which our long-suffering peoples demand today
more than ever.
<P>        
Despite great dangers and the need for major sacrifices, this act is also a reaffirmation
by the Cuban Government of the genuinely peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. But
we reiterate in all responsibility that the obstacles which have so far prevented our becoming
full parties in this Treaty remain and continue seriously to affect the security of our country.
<P>
The only nuclear Power in this part of the world, the United States of America, is
maintaining a policy of hostility towards Cuba which involves strengthening of the economic,
commercial and financial blockade, reinforcement of the campaign against my country and
the maintenance by force and against the will of our people of the illegal occupation of part
of the national territory, through which even ships carrying nuclear weapons pass, a problem
whose solution will in the future have to be considered a condition for our country to stay
within the Treaty.
<P>
We are not talking here about dangers for Cuba alone, for in fact the tensions
provoked by the aggressive escalation and the siege laid by the United States are potentially
explosive risks for the rest of the continent, which cannot feel secure when faced with the
impunity of a neighbouring power which ignores international law and the resolutions of the
United Nations in the pursuit of clearly hegemonistic and geopolitical goals which are more
unfounded than ever now that the bipolar confrontation and the Cold War have come to an
end in the rest of the world.
<P>
 It is not right that only the countries of Latin America should be asked formally to
renounce the possession of nuclear weapons and to accept independent checks on their        
compliance with this commitment, unless at the same time, under the provisions of the
Tlatelolco Treaty, verification is demanded of the obligations assumed by the nuclear Powers
in accordance with Protocols I and II of this instrument.
<P>
This would allow it to be established that this type of armament does not exist in any
part of the territory of Latin America and the Caribbean, and thus we would be able to
affirm with confidence that the region is genuinely free of nuclear weapons.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>         
Mr. Chancellor,
<P>         
For Cuba it has always been a principle to speak out against all weapons of mass
extermination. Similarly, we consider that no country should have a monopoly on such
weapons, in this case nuclear weapons, because such a monopoly establishes a privileged
status which runs counter to the principle of sovereign equality of States.
<P>
We are in favour of the total banning of nuclear weapons as the only way of
guaranteeing a lasting peace and the security of everyone without distinction. Those who
must in the first instance honour this principle are the so-called nuclear Powers. Therefore
Cuba continues to reject the privilege held by the States possessing nuclear weapons, which
in maintaining their status demand of the international community the renunciation of this
option, negative as it may be. Moreover, it is inconsistent for the Powers to undertake
modest reductions in their arsenals when what remains would be more than sufficient to
destroy our planet several times over.
<P>
It was for strictly moral reasons that Cuba, having no potential, resources or
technology to manufacture such weapons, did not sign the Tlatelolco Treaty earlier. To do
so we considered would constitute a unilateral renunciation in return for which we would
receive only hostility, pressure and threats of aggression from the United States. On the other
hand, we also bore in mind that not all countries in the region had signed the Treaty.
<P>
Nonetheless, in recent times the regional scenario has changed substantially for Cuba.
We are rejoining what we never ceased to belong, to the community of Latin America and
the Caribbean, with which we have developed and strengthened relations which, albeit
insufficient, are confirmation of the desire for integration which our country has always had
since the very birth of Cuban nationality and the ideas of our wars of independence.
<P>
From a country isolated by imperialist design, with the honourable exception of
 Mexico, Cuba is maintaining and intensifying its relations with practically the entire
continent, on which rejection of the United States blockade against Cuba is spreading wider
every day.
<P>
The integration of our peoples is not only possible today, it is also necessary as being
the only way to reaffirm and defend the economic and political independence of Latin
America
<P>
These latter considerations explain our decision today to sign the Tlatelolco Treaty
despite the continued existence, and in some cases even accentuation, of the reasons for
which Cuba until now abstained from taking such an important step.
<P>
Once again, this decision is an addition to our modest contribution to the unity, solidarity
and integration of peoples from the Rio Bravo to Patagonia, of this greater Fatherland which,
in his vision of the future, Jose Martl defined as Our America.
<P>
Many thanks.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The Governments of the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, and the United States of America believe that internationally recognised nuclear weapons
free zones, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region
concerned, can contribute to international peace and security.  The 1995 NPT review and extension
conference recognised this fact and encouraged the creation of such zones as a matter of priority. 
The conference also recognised that the cooperation of all the nuclear weapon States and their
respect and support for the relevant protocols is necessary for the maximum effectiveness of such
nuclear weapons free zones and the relevant protocols.  In this regard, we are jointly announcing
today our intention to sign the relevant protocols to the treaty of Rarotonga in the first half of 1996."

 <FONT SIZE=6>INIS History</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The origins of the International Nuclear Information System (INIS)
date to 1966 when consultants from the USSR and USA outlined a
scheme for an international information system. The birth of such
a globally oriented nuclear information system, however, was some
years in the making.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Between the late 1940's and into the middle of the 1960's, a number
of countries established national information activities in the
nuclear area. Duplication of efforts and incomplete coverage of
all the nuclear literature accompanied these activities. The International
Atomic Energy Agency was founded in 1957 and offered a framework
within a United Nations Organization for cooperation in a wide
range of nuclear related activities, among them information exchange.
In 1965, the Director General of the IAEA invited two consultants,
one from the USA and the other from the former USSR, to formulate
a proposal for an international system to provide nuclear information
services to users in all IAEA Member States (countries) and led
in 1966 to a first documented proposal for an international system.
<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This proposal needed a detailed system design in order to enable
Member States to evaluate the feasibility of establishing such
a system. The detailed design was carried out by a group of experts
during 1968. They produced the &quot;INIS Study Team Report&quot;
which formed the basis of the INIS system. INIS was approved as
a part of the IAEA programme by the Board of Governors of the
IAEA in February 1969. Participating Member States began reporting
records of their national nuclear literature to the System in
early 1970 and the first INIS output product <I>Atomindex</I>
both in printed form and on magnetic tape appeared in 1970.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since that time a number of major milestones have punctuated the
INIS road; availability of the Database online from a number of
commercial hosts in the late 1970's; adoption of controlled terminology
for identifying <A HREF="../products/database/scope.htm">subject scope</A>
of documents in 1971; introduction of abstracts in machine-readable
in 1975; availability of the <A HREF="../products/database/online.htm">INIS Database online</A>
from the Agency's computer on an experimental basis in 1977 and
on a regular basis in 1985; introduction of an expert system for
quality control in 1989; availability of the <A HREF="../products/database/cd-rom.htm">Database on CD-ROM</A>
in 1991; expansion of the subject scope to include the environmental
and economic aspects of non-nuclear energy sources in 1992; and
routine receipt of input to the system by electronic mail in 1993.
In 1995, INIS celebrated its 25th Anniversary .<BR>

 <FONT SIZE=6>INIS Philosophy</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="../graphic/policy.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=0 VSPACE=30 HSAPCE=20>
<FONT SIZE=3>The basis of INIS is international co-operation.
It is the first international information system in which both
the collection of input and the dissemination of output to users
are decentralized. Only the data processing and output production
are centralized in the INIS Secretariat. This decentralized approach
to input and output was selected because it results in the most
comprehensive coverage of the nuclear literature, the most effective
method of handling information in different languages, and the
most satisfactory services for users of the information.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The design of the International Nuclear Information System has
its origins in a particular philosophy recognized by the original
planners of the System and subsequent operators as being beneficial
for an international system operating under the auspices of a
UN organization. This philosopy can be considered to have a number
of facets:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(1) <B>Mission oriented approach</B> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The mission of INIS, as explained in greater detail in the <A HREF="glanmis.htm">Mission</A>
Section, is to provide information on nuclear literature published
throughout the world on the peaceful applications of nuclear science
and technology.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(2) <B>Decentralized operation</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The roles played by participating Member States are critical for
the operation of the System. The national literature published
within the boundary of each Member State (country) or organizational
confines if an international body is to be scanned, indexed, abstracted,
and described bibliographically for input to INIS by a designated
national centre in each Member. The input thus prepared is sent
to INIS Headquarters at the IAEA in Vienna where it is merged,
checked, corrected and the output products prepared. The output
products covering the full file are then returned to the individual
Members who are responsible for the provision of nuclear information
services to users within their national boundaries or organizational
confines. This decentralized approach (see <A HREF="../products/fulltext/schemati.htm">schematic</A>)
results in a more comprehensive coverage of the nuclear literature,
is more effective for handling information in different languages
and is instrumental in spreading the cost for operation of the
system in a reasonably equitable manner between large and small
producers and users of the literature.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(3) <B>Specialized document delivery</B> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The INIS system collects the <A HREF="../products/microfic/index.htm">full text of documents</A>
for the so-called non-conventional<B> </B>(grey) literature. The
full text is available in microform and will be made available
in electronic form in the foreseeable future.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(4) <B>Universality of <A HREF="../products/products.htm">output products</A>
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The range of INIS output products includes the printed &quot;Atomindex&quot;
together with its cumulative indexes; the updates to the Database
on magnetic media; the database online from the computer at the
IAEA and other international hosts; the database on CD-ROM, the
full text of non-conventional literature on microfiche; and other
documentation, such as the INIS manuals (INIS Reference Series).
The range of <A HREF="../products/products.htm">output products</A>
enables national centres or individual users to select whichever
product can be most efficiently used within the information infrastructure
existing at the national centre or available to the individual
user.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(5) <A HREF="../products/training/index.htm">Training and assistance to Members</A>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
An extensive <A HREF="../products/training/index.htm">INIS Training Program</A>
both for input preparation and provision of information services
from the output products has always been a part of the INIS Philosophy.
Further assistance is provided in the form of specialized software
packages, promotional material and execution of projects in the
framework of IAEA Technical Co-operation activities targeted at
improving national information technology infrastructure.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=6>INIS Mission</FONT> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The statutes of the IAEA contain an obligation to further the
exchange of scientific and technical information on all aspects
of the peaceful applicaton of nuclear science and technology.
The INIS system was established with the mission of enabling efficient
and effective transfer of information on literature in the nuclear
area published throughout the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The original mission was defined in a statement resulting from
the interpretation of the original 1968 design of the System.
The mission statement was as follows:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<DL>
<DT>&quot;To produce and disseminate in a decentralized manner
a computer based bibliographic database containing records and
abstracts of the literature produced throughtout the world on
all the peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology
and to collect and make available the full text of those items
not readily available through normal commercial channels&quot;
<BR>
whereby &quot;..... all the peaceful applications of nuclear science
and technology....&quot; has always been interpreted to include
also the so-called peripheral areas, such as nuclear applications
in Chemistry, Medicine, Life Sciences, Agriculture, etc. <BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../graphic/collage.gif" BORDER=0></CENTER> 
<BR>
A changing information technology environment together with increased
financial constraints and the need to eliminate duplication and
reduce costs led a recent meeting of the Advisory Committee for
INIS to propose an amended statement of the INIS mission which
reads:
</DL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;INIS will respond to the information needs of the International
Nuclear Community by providing in a decentralized manner a comprehensive
information service in the areas of interest and activities of
the IAEA. This will be achieved by:</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<DL>
<DT>- continuing to build a high quality bibliographic database
for the nuclear<BR>
literature;<BR>
- providing full text of the non-conventional part of the above
literature;<BR>
- providing mechanisms to facilitate access to bibliographic information
<BR>
and full text of nuclear related literature available elsewhere;
<BR>
- providing mechanisms to access other types of nuclear information.&quot;
<BR>
On the basis of this new mission statement the provision of nuclear
information will rely on a dual approach; the concurrent existence
of a high quality database created by INIS as well as the use
of up-to-date tele-networking technology for accessing nuclear
information available elsewhere. Similar technologies can also
provide access to the full text of relevant nuclear literature.
INIS operations based on the new mission statement are in the
early development stages.<BR>
<BR>

play a key role in the INIS system. Liaison Officers are the official
representatives of participating INIS member countries and/or
international organizations. They provide the Secretariat with
advice on matters relating to the administration, operation, and
development of INIS. They are responsible for organizing the collection of information in their
country and for the preparation of input from their country or
international organization. They are also responsible for the
dissemination of INIS products through their information services
and for encouraging their utilization.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The INIS Liaison Officers provide the <A HREF="glansec.htm">INIS Secretariat</A>
with advice on matters relating to the administration, operation,
and development of INIS. Regular communication takes place by
correspondence and through the Annual Consultative Meetings of
the INIS Liaison Officers. Proceedings of these meetings contain
the findings and recommendations of the Liaison Officers; this
feedback is always given very serious consideration by the INIS
Secretariat. An important contributing factor to the success
of INIS has been the spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation
that has developed among individual Liaison Officers, the Liaison
Officers as a group, and the INIS staff at the IAEA.

INIS also receives advise from the INIS Advisory Committee who
reports to the Director General of the IAEA. The Committee includes
producers, users, and administrators of information organizations,
has a broad geographical distribution and represents the interests
of developing countries. Major policy and budgetary matters are
referred to this Committee.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
All aspects of the changed environment under which INIS has to
operate were reviewed by the 9th Advisory Committee for INIS held
in November-December 1994. Prior to the meeting several actions
were initiated including the carrying out of a User Needs Study
and a Subject Search Study, and the drafting of &quot;Strategic
Guidelines for INIS Developments 1995-2000&quot; including its
evaluation by a group of INIS consultants. In particular, the
Committee discussed the changed role that INIS can play as the
source of information to fulfil the statutory requirement of the
IAEA. The Committee has recommended that access to nuclear information
would be ensured not only by producing the INIS Database as it
has been in the past, but also that access to bibliographic information
and full text documents available elsewhere would become part
of the overall INIS approach to the provision of nuclear information.

<FONT  SIZE=4><B>WITH THE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY DATA EXCHANGE</FONT>
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDE), a program of the International
Energy Agency (IEA), is a worldwide consortium of countries that
share energy-related scientific and technical information through
the Energy Database. The Exchange, as does INIS, recognizes the
benefits of collaboration and co-operation. A significant partnering
venture is with the International Atomic Energy Agency's International
Nuclear Information System (INIS). During the 15th ETDE Executive
Committee meeting in Cernay-la-Ville, France, in May 1994, the
two organizations formalized a longstanding relationship by signing
a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). INIS and ETDE are both international
information systems that were established to facilitate information
sharing among their member countries. INIS focuses on the peaceful
uses of nuclear energy and environmental aspects of all energy;
ETDE focuses on all aspects of energy. All ETDE member countries
are also members of INIS. Because of this membership duality for
ETDE countries, the Exchange adopted INIS standards for information
exchange, with some minor modifications to accommodate ETDE's
broader scope. The agreement signed in 1994 identifies specific
areas for future co-operation, with a special emphasis on database
development and the assurance of data integrity. Goals for technical
cooperation include shared authorities, standards and publications.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As a result of the MOU, the ETDE Operating Agency for the first
time attended the INIS Liaison Officers meeting held in Vienna
in May 1995. That meeting also marked the celebration of INIS's
25th Anniversary. In October 1995, ETDE and INIS held the first
in a series of joint technical meetings which are expected to
lead to increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness for member
countries of both international information organizations. INIS
and ETDE continue to have joint technical meetings.<BR> For information

<DT>
<DD>In May 1970 the first electronic and printed products of INIS
were distributed to Member States of the IAEA. INIS, as a co-operative
programme between the Secretariat at the IAEA and the participating
Member States, was established. It was proved through the years
to be one of the most effective tools for the international exchange
of information relating to the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
<BR>
The INIS Members commemorated the silver anniversary through use
of different media such as press releases, articles in information
and scientific journals, booklets, announcements on hosts, advertising
in information journals, exhibitions, etc. The INIS Secretariat
produced various promotional articles for use by INIS Members.
<BR>
The 1995 meeting of INIS Liaison Officers also commemorated the
Twenty Fifth Anniversary. IAEA Director General, Dr. Hans Blix
delivered the opening address. He presented a brief review of
the establishment of INIS, emphasizing the novel aspect of decentralization
in both input preparation and information dissemination. He also
stressed the current importance of INIS in exchange of information
in peaceful uses of atomic energy.<BR>
Papers especially prepared for the Twenty Fifth Anniversary portion
of the meeting programme were presented by four invited keynote
speakers, Mr. E. Brunenkant, former Director of the IAEA's Division
of Scientific and Technical Information, Mr. B. Mahon, Executive
Director of EUSIDIC, Ms. T.C. Rumsey, Director of the Office of
Science, Education and Technical Information of the United States
Department of Energy and Mr. V. Terent'ev, Director of ATOMINFORM,
Moscow, Russian Federation.<BR>
INIS is the largest of the electronic databases created by the
IAEA in co-operation with its Member States. Its continuing success
reflects the active support and participation of IAEA Member States.

<H3><A NAME="INIS_STRATEGIC_STUDY">INIS STRATEGIC STUDY </A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>At the 1994 Consultative Meeting of INIS Liaison Officers,
it was noted that during the past 25 years the information environment
has changed, information technology and electronic data exchange
have been revolutionized, the economics of information services
at the National Centers have changed, and the role of nuclear
energy has altered.<BR>
The needs for nuclear information are also different from those
originally envisaged. All of these factors, coinciding with the
25th anniversary of INIS and the approach of the 21st century,
led to a recommendation for a strategic review of the overall
objectives and operations of INIS.<BR>
It was recommended that the INIS Secretariat conduct a Strategic
Study that would bring the organization into line with current
and anticipated developments in information technology. The Secretariat
contracted for this study in mid 1994, and the results, <U>Strategic
Guidelines for INIS Developments 1995-2000</U>, were presented
to the 9th Advisory Committee for INIS, which met in Vienna, 29
November - 1 December 1994.<BR>
The Advisory Committee, after reviewing the recommendations of
the strategic study, and comparing the original ideas for the
creation of INIS to current and anticipated requirements, drafted
a new mission statement for INIS whose essential points are that
INIS:
</DL>

<UL>
<LI>Continue to build high quality bibliographic databases for
the nuclear literature;
<LI>Provide full text of the non-conventional part of the above
literature; and
<LI>Provide mechanisms to facilitate access to bibliographic information
and full text of nuclear related literature available elsewhere.
</UL>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>This broad strategic guidance was based on:

and services by the INIS Secretariat and Member States. These
will include:
</DL>

<UL>
<LI>Re-evaluation of the scope of information that should be included
in the INIS database;
<LI>Upgrading current IAEA/INIS computer and telecommunications
technology to increase productivity of Member States;
<LI>Making the INIS database available for electronic downloading
by FTP and by distribution on CD-ROM at a fraction of current
prices;
<LI>Production of full text in an electronic format for further
dissemination by a variety of media; and
<LI>Formation of partnerships with other organizations in order
to share information of mutual interest, and to provide gateways
to remote databases.
</UL>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>Operationally, INIS has already begun to implement many of
these developments. These include an ongoing comparison of database
content to IAEA areas of interest, a requirements study for an
enhanced FIBRE and eventual INIS Work Station, implementation
of an INIS Internet World Wide Web home page with links to other
nuclear sites of interest, development of a full text imaging
capability and dissemination of NCL on CD-ROM and other media,
and initiation of partnerships with scientific publishers and
database organizations.<BR>
A variety of other changes, outlined in the strategic guidelines,
and by the INIS Advisory, Technical and Consultative Committees,
will be implemented in the next several years in order to assure
that INIS and Members are able to take full advantages of emerging
information technologies.

<H3><A NAME="The_24th_MEETING">24th MEETING OF INIS LIAISON OFFICERS,
KYOTO, MAY 1996 </A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>At the invitation of the government of Japan, the Twenty-fourth
Consultative Meeting of INIS Liaison Officers was held in Kyoto,
Japan in the final week of May. The Meeting marked the twenty-fifth
anniversary of INIS activities in Japan and aroused considerable
media interest - the opening session was even featured on a national
television news programme. Forty-nine participants representing
forty-seven countries and two international organizations and
a number of observers attended.<BR>
Discussions at the Consultative Meeting of INIS Liaison Officers
covered a wide range of topics and were very fruitful, providing
the INIS Secretariat with guidance on a number of key issues.
In particular, the Liaison Officers considered several points
connected with the framework for Strategic Guidelines for INIS
developments adopted in 1995. The recom-mendations of the Meeting
will influence future enhancements of the FIBRE software and the
PC-based training package and will also help the Secretariat to
finalize work on the preparation of the INIS Home Page. Other
areas considered include the possible redefinition of the INIS
subject scope, especially in some areas of &quot;basic&quot; science,
and the inclusion in the database of records from other sources.
With regard to this final topic, the Liaison Officers recommended
strongly that records from other sources be adapted to conform
fully to INIS rules; this decision is a strong vindication of
the high quality of the INIS database. Further details of the
discussions on these and other topics are to be found in the Report
of the Proceedings, previously distributed to all INIS Liaison
Officers.<BR>
In conjunction with the Meeting of INIS Liaison Officers, three
additional &quot;satellite&quot; meetings were held. One of these
was attended by representatives of &quot;large&quot; inputting
centres and aimed to identify more cost-effective ways for these
centres to input information to the database. The other meetings
were for representatives of countries participating in one of
the IAEA regional Technical Co-operation Projects RAS/0/019 or
RER/0/011 to upgrade the nuclear information systems in East Asia
and the Pacific and Europe. Again, details of these meetings have
been presented separately.<BR>
In addition to the discussions and scientific visits to the Nara
Institute of Science and Technology and Broadband - ISDN Business
Chance and Culture Creation, participants and observers enjoyed
a full programme of social and sightseeing events arranged by
our Japanese hosts, highlights of which included trips to the
Todai-ji and Horyu-ji temples in Nara. Evening receptions provided
a welcome chance to chat socially with old friends while sampling
the delights of Japanese cuisine. Our thanks are due to the staff
of the Japanese National INIS Centre, especially to the Liaison
Officer Mr N. Hiramatsu, for all they did to make our time in
Japan so pleasurable.

<H3><A NAME="INIS_CONTINUES">INIS CONTINUES TO EMBRACE NEW INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY </A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>INIS, from its inception almost 26 years ago, embraced computer
technology for maximizing information management. The INIS Secretariat
has continued through the years to use computer-based technology
for both input and output of INIS operations, products and services.
This tradition continues with the embracing of new information
technologies available on the Internet. During 1996, INIS has
been developing a Home Page to disseminate information on the
Internet via the World Wide Web.<BR>
Why an INIS Home Page? Development of an INIS Home Page was recommended
by INIS Liaison Officers in the 1995 Liaison Officer Meeting.
The Home Page, as a new world-wide dissemination media, is perceived
to facilitate a number of objectives, including:
</DL>

<UL>
<LI>Provision of INIS information to members;
<LI>Introducing INIS to non-members and the general public;
<LI>Providing an entry point for the INIS database;
<LI>Offering external links to other relevant in-scope INIS type
information; and
<LI>Permitting full text document delivery.
</UL>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>The Main INIS home pages include organizational information,
products and services, database access, external links (including
to INIS Liaison Officers), news, key word search and a guestbook.
The Home Page has a Help Section to assist users in accessing
the Home Page.<BR>
Work began on the Home Page in January, 1996. A prototype was
presented at the May Liaison Officers meeting in Japan. Subsequent
to the Meeting, the prototype went through some revision based
on the ILOs feedback. It is anticipated the feedback from INIS
Liaison Officers will help to improve the Home Page and make this
new dissemination technology useful to the INIS community.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="INIS_DATA_PROCESSING">INIS DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM
(IDPS) </A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>The development of the new INIS Data Processing System (IDPS)
is a primary development project for INIS for the period 1994-1997.
The goal of the project is migrating from the mainframe technology
to modern Client/Server architecture. The implementation of IDPS
will allow INIS to make better use of human and other resources,
to improve operational efficiency, to simplify maintenance procedures,
to reduce data processing cost and to use paperless technology.
<BR>
IDPS consists of four subsystems:
</DL>

<OL>
<LI>The INIS Authority Maintenance Subsystem which includes Thesaurus
Maintenance Subsystem, Journal Titles Maintenance Subsystem and
Corporate Names Maintenance Subsystem;
<LI>The INIS Record Processing Subsystem (IRPS);
<LI>The INIS Input Registration Subsystem; and
<LI>The INIS Ordering Subsystem.
</OL>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>The development of the INIS database online retrieval system
and the system for printing INIS products are out of the scope
of the project.<BR>
The new <I>INIS Data Processing System</I> has been developed
on the basis of Client/Server architecture. The server part is
based on a UNIX/C/Sybase environment and an IBM-RISC/6000 computer
has been installed as an INIS Production Server. The client part
is based on a Windows/C/C++/Visual Basic environment.<BR>
The development of the <I>INIS Authority Maintenance</I> <I>Subsystem</I>
has been completed and the Thesaurus Maintenance Subsystem has
been in operation since January 1995. The new system is much friendlier
and faster than the old one, and provides multilingual support.
The rest of the Authority subsystems will be implemented together
with IRPS.<BR>
The <I>INIS Record Processing Subsystem</I> is now under implementation.
The System allows input and correction of INIS records via online
dialog and has a direct link to the Authority Maintenance Subsystem.
An important technical idea implemented in IRPS is to use the
FIBRE checking engine as a core of the new system. FIBRE will
provide all checks on the server and on the clients.<BR>
The <I>INIS Input Registration Subsystem</I> and the <I>INIS Ordering
Subsystem</I> will be developed after implementation of IRPS.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="New_databases">NEW DATABASES AVAILABLE IN 1997 </A>
</H3>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>The INIS bibliographic database will be very soon available
at a significantly reduced price and a new non-conventional literature
(NCL) full-text database on CD-ROM will be available in 1997.
Cost of these databases are not currently determined, but it is
anticipated they will be significantly lower than the cost of
the current database on CD-ROM and NCL microfiche standing order.
<BR>
The bibliographic database will continue to use the SilverPlatter
WINSPIRS software. This will eliminate requirements for new training.
It is expected that production of the database, and quarterly
updates<BR>
with the new price, will commence in early 1997. INIS will produce
six archival CD-ROMs for the bibliographic database which include
one new archival disk<B> </B>for INIS data from 1970 up to 1975,
and a quarterly update<B>.</B> <BR>
The NCL full-text database will contain all (non-US) reports now
disseminated on microfiche.<BR>
US reports will be added in the future. INIS expects to have an
operational imaging capability in early 1997 and dissemination
of the database will begin in the first quarter. Retrieval using
the NCL CD-ROM will be by the report numbers or INIS reference
number. It will eventually be linked to the INIS bibliographic
database. The NCL full-text CD-<BR>
ROM collection will consist initially of approximately 50 CD-ROMs
a year increasing to 150 per year as the US non-conventional literature
is included in the database.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="PC_TRAINING">PC-TRAINING PACKAGE IS BEING TESTED
IN INIS CENTERS </A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>The INIS Training Program has several objectives, including
improving the quality of the INIS database, better coverage of
INIS subject scope, improvement of INIS services, establishing
and/or improving the national information infrastructure, and
transferring modern information technology. In keeping with these
objectives, the INIS Secretariat has been developing a PC-Based
Training Package for use by INIS members.<BR>
The Training Package is being created with the anticipation of
also achieving several important objectives including:
</DL>

<UL>
<LI>Providing efficient and cost effective training within INIS
Centers;
<LI>Providing an on-site self-teaching tool;
<LI>Allowing individuals to learn at their own pace;
<LI>Broadening the availability of training to all INIS members;
<LI>Utilizing multi-media, multilingual, multi-senses techniques
to enhance learning; and
<LI>Facilitating the process for learning INIS input procedures
at the point of need within an INIS Centre.
</UL>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>The INIS PC-Based Training Package has four sections and a
Coursebook.<BR>
The sections include:
</DL>

<UL>
<LI>How to Use the PC-Based Training Package;
<LI>Introducing INIS (a 10 minute promotional tool which has sound
and can be used as a &quot;rolling demo&quot; for INIS promotion
at conferences, meetings, etc.);
<LI>Subject Analysis; and
<LI>Bibliographic Description.
</UL>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>The Coursebook includes examples of case studies for post
tests and a feedback form. Teaching techniques and capabilities
in the Package include, for example, questioning techniques, practice
ability; glossary; highlighting; voice off/on; stated objectives
by module and function buttons.<BR>
The PC-Based Training Package will be output on a CD-ROM. For
use, it will require a 486 PC with 3.1 Windows or higher, a graphics
card capable of 640*480*64000 colours, 8MB RAM and a mouse. Each
INIS Centre will be provided a copy of the final CD-ROM and Coursebook.
<BR>
The Package was presented for review by INIS Liaison Officers
at the May Liaison Officers Meeting in Japan. It is currently
being tested and evaluated by INIS Centres. The Secretariat expects
to issue the final version to INIS members by January, 1997. Review
and feedback from INIS Centres is expected to help validate and
improve the Training Package.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="WinFIBRE_and_requirements">WinFIBRE AND REQUIREMENTS
OF FIBRE </A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>In 1995/1996 the INIS Secretariat continued the development
of the FIBRE (Friendly Inputting of Bibliographic Records) software.
In particular, following requests made by INIS National Centres,
the Windows version of FIBRE has been developed and distributed
to INIS inputting centres.<BR>
The FIBRE package consists of several modules: checking engine,
interface, authority viewer, authority files, files with checking
rules and matrixes, and help files. During the development of
WinFIBRE only the FIBRE interface and authority viewer have been
fully redesigned. It means that WinFIBRE uses the same checking
engine and the same data files (user defined matrixes, authority
files, format description files, cross checking rules files, and
spelling checker files) as DOS FIBRE 2.1. and, therefore, WinFIBRE
is fully compatible with DOS FIBRE.<BR>
WinFIBRE interface looks and acts like any other program that
runs under Microsoft Windows&#153;.<BR>
The screen layout, dialogs, menus, shortcut keys, and toolbars
are different, however, from those of the DOS FIBRE 2.1 version.
<I>DOS FIBRE users should treat WinFIBRE as a new program that
does everything FIBRE 2.1 could do but in a Windows-standard way.</I>
WinFIBRE has a Windows standard Multiple Document Interface (MDI)
and during an edit session more than one input file can be opened
at a time. Users can also change the types and sizes of font,
send files with prepared INIS records directly from WinFIBRE as
an attachment to MS E-mail, and exchange information with other
Windows applications using copy and paste functions.<BR>
Some of the WinFIBRE modules can be used independently on WinFIBRE.
In particular users can run the WinFIBRE authority viewer to consult
INIS authorities and load WinFIBRE help file to consult electronic
versions of both <I>WinFibre User's Manual</I> and <I>Guide of
Bibliographic Description (IAEA-INIS-1). <BR>
</I>The development of the WinFIBRE software was done in close
co-operation with INIS National Centres which have provided very
important ideas and suggestions. The WinFIBRE user's manual has
been prepared by the Canadian INIS Centre and WinFIBRE Help has
been improved by Bulgarian and Belorussian INIS Centres.<BR>
Hardware and software requirements for running WinFIBRE:<BR>
<B>Computer</B>: IBM PC or compatible computer capable of running
Microsoft Windows&#153;.<BR>
<B>Memory:</B> Minimum 4MB of RAM (random access memory).<BR>
<B>Hard disk</B>: Slightly under 7 MB of space<B>. <BR>
Monitor</B>
</DL>

<P>
: VGA or higher.<BR>
<B>Operating system: </B>Microsoft Windows&#153; version 3.1 or
3.11.<BR>
<B>Floppy disk drive:</B> Send input to the INIS Secretariat on
5.25 inch or 3.5 inch disks.<BR>
<B>Mouse</B>: A mouse is almost essential, although it is possible
to do most things with keystrokes 
<H3><A NAME="INIS_information">INIS INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE VIA
FTP AND EMAIL </A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>To facilitate and expedite the delivery of INIS information,
the INIS Secretariat has an Internet FTP server to distribute
information (i.e. INIS Reference Manuals, INIS Atomindex files,
and INIS Authorities). Information on this server is updated frequently,
i.e. every two weeks and after each production cycle, a new INIS
Atomindex file is added on the FTP server and INIS Members are
informed accordingly. INIS Authorities as well as INIS Reference
Manuals are also updated accordingly and made available to Members.
For those INIS Centres which do not have FTP facilities, the INIS
Secretariat sends INIS Atomindex files and INIS Authorities as
an attachment to email message. Both services are proving to be
very useful to INIS Members.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="NEA_computer">NEA COMPUTER PROGRAM SERVICE SUPPORTED
BY INIS </A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency Data Bank (NEADB) operates
a computer program service related to nuclear energy and technology
applications. The software library collects programs and upon
receipt of requests from users, verifies them in an appropriate
computer environment ensuring that the computer program package
is complete and adequately documented. The material is then distributed
to users. This collection of tested material contains more than
1600 packages. Standard software verification procedures are used
following an ANSI/ANS standard. A co-operative arrangement in
this field has been established with the IAEA. As support for
this service, Mr. Juan Galan, staff member of the INIS CSU is
located at the NEA in Paris working directly with the Data Bank
Program. INIS also provides the IAEA Liaison Officer for this
service.<BR>
An on-line search service for computer program abstracts is available
on Internet. (http://www.nea.fr/html/dbprog.html). Programs are
dispatched to users by network, magnetic tape, diskette, cartridges
or CD-ROM.<BR>
The NEADB distributes to and acquires computer codes from more
than 500 accredited institutions from its 19 member countries
and from another 65 IAEA member countries. Institutions are entitled
to use the service after approval from their national authorities.
The institutions from IAEA member countries have to contact, through
their national authorities, the Permanent Mission of their country
to the IAEA in Vienna. The Permanent Mission will then contact
the Director General of IAEA informing him of the desired participation,
and at the same time the Permanent Mission should nominate someone
to act as a liaison officer between the establishment and the
NEADB.<BR>
Every year about 150 new computer programs or versions are acquired.
More than 25,000 computer program packages have been sent out
to requesters since the beginning of this service in 1964 of which
about 4500 were sent to non-OECD countries. The annual total distribution
during the last few years was on the average more than 1500. Fifty
percent of the requests were sent in recent years to governmental
laboratories or agencies; thirty percent went to universities
and the other twenty percent to industry and utilities.<BR>
As a rule, programs are provided for non-profit research studies.
The agreement of the originating establishment must be obtained
before a service is offered involving use on a fee-paying basis
of any program distributed by the Data Bank. This restriction
also applies to modified versions derived from program copies
obtained from the NEADB.<BR>
Transfer of a program to a user in a given establishment confers
only the right to use the program within that organisation; in
particular, copies of programs should not be distributed to persons
outside their own establishment..

<H3><A NAME="INIS_video">INIS VIDEOFILM UNDER PRODUCTION </A>
</H3>

<DL>
<DT>
<DD>Following the recommendation of the INIS Liaison Officers,
the INIS Secretariat has begun production of a new INIS promotional
film. The present videofilm, produced about 9 years ago and considered
by the INIS National Centres as a very efficient promotion tool,
is obsolete. The need for the replacement has been expressed many
times by INIS Member States.<BR>
In 1995, the INIS Secretariat contracted the National Technical
Information Centre and Library (OMIKK), Budapest, Hungary for
the film production. The English version of the film is expected
to be ready for distribution by the 25th Consultative Meeting
of INIS Liaison Officers in May 1997.

<P>
From 1970 to the present, the INIS Database has announced the
scientific literature published worldwide on the peaceful applications
of nuclear science and technology; from 1992, the Database also
includes the economic and environmental aspects of all non-nuclear
energy sources. The INIS Database contains more than 1.8 million
scientific and technical bibliographic references that have been
selected, abstracted and indexed in English by INIS Members according
to agreed rules and standards. Bibliographic citations and abstracts
for journal articles, research and development reports, conference
papers, books, patents, theses, laws, regulations and standards
are included in the Database. <HR>

Literature reported to INIS may be subdivided into two categories,
conventional and non-conventional. Conventional literature is
that literature which is commercially available through the normal
distribution channels, such as the book and magazine trade or
publishing houses. Non-conventional literature comprises all other
forms of literature, including scientific and technical reports,
patent documents, pre-conference papers, and non-commercially
published theses not readily available through commercial channels.
Non-conventional literature is available through the INIS Clearinghouse.
The full text INIS collection comprises publications on peaceful
uses of nuclear energy from 1970 to the present. Publications
may be purchased without restriction. The legibility and quality
of microfiche depends on the technical quality of full size documents
received by the Clearinghouse. The quality of INIS microfiche
is above the international standard.<BR>

The INIS Clearinghouse, a unit within the INIS Secretariat of
the IAEA supplies, on request, microfiche copies of most of the
non-conventional literature announced in the INIS output products.
Microfiche copies are produced on photographic film in a standard
size of 105 mm x 148.75 mm. Each fiche can contain up to 98 pages
of original full text, reduced at a ratio of 24.1. The Report,
Standard and Patent Number Index of <A HREF="../database/atom.htm">INIS Atomindex</A>
serves as a catalog of full text documents available from the
INIS Clearinghouse.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is very important for the quality of INIS output products
to ensure a common understanding of the INIS standards and rules
by the staff of all inputting centers of INIS Members. For this
reason, the INIS Training Program plays a significant role in
INIS activity. All aspects of INIS operations are thoroughly considered
in the training events organized by the IAEA for INIS members,
including selection criteria, abstracting, descriptive cataloging,
indexing, retrieval, marketing and promotion. The training events
are aimed at assisting INIS Members in training personnel newly
involved in input preparation and utilization of output products.
A PC-Based Training Package is under development for individual
training. Through the IAEA program of Technical Co-operation,
the INIS Secretariat provides assistance to developing countries
participating in INIS in their establishment and operatio of information

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>According to the &quot;Definition of Membership Arrangement
for INIS,&quot; each INIS Member is responsible for promoting
and marketing INIS products and services within its applicable
boundaries (or organizational confines if an international body).
The INIS Secretariat assists by providing general promotional
materials about INIS and its Database. These materials include,
for example, a brochure, <I> <A HREF="../../pdf/present.pdf">Presenting INIS</A>
, the <A HREF="../../pdf/perirep.pdf">INIS Periodic Report</A> </I>
, presentation visuals, an INIS display including a CD-ROM of
the INIS subject scope, etc. Members use different tools and opportunities
to provide information on the Database and its capabilities to
potential users and assist the actual users in improving their
skills at searching and retrieving information from the Database.

Dear Sir,
<P>         
         On behalf of the Arab States Members of the Agency and members of the Board, I
         wish to express the concern felt by the Arab Governments and peoples at the news and
         reports concerning the potential danger of leakage of nuclear radiation at the Israeli Dimona
         reactor and the hazards of storage and burial of atomic waste in the area of the reactor, for
         they feel that the continued existence of the nuclear reactor without any real knowledge about
         the extent of its safety and also the nuclear waste burial sites in the area pose a threat to
         security, life and the environment.
<P>         
         The following are among the factors that increase the intensity of this concern:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Persistence of news and reports, including reports from Israeli sources, about
         radiation leakage at the reactor and the nuclear waste burial sites in the area
         of the reactor;
<P>
<LI>The reactor is old and has reached the end of its assumed lifetime;
<P>
<LI>The region is subject to earthquakes and earth tremors;
<P>
<LI>Monitoring of radiation leakage into groundwater across the borders will
         require a long time before such leakage is detected in the neighbouring States,
         making it technically difficult to determine, on the basis of measurements
         performed outside Israel's borders, that there was no accident which might
         have devastating consequences in the future.
</OL>
<P>         
         His Excellency Dr. H. Blix
<BR>
         Director General
<BR>
         IAEA, Vienna
<P>

         The continuation of Israeli nuclear activities outside international control does not
         provide the least assurance about the nuclear safety of these activities, and there is no doubt
         that any nuclear accident in Israel will have transboundary effects and give rise to hazards
         beyond its borders. For this reason, it is necessary that there should be at least a minimum
         of transparency in the Israeli nuclear activities and that Israel should become a party to the
         Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to a safeguards agreement with the
         Agency.
<P>         
         It is therefore requested that necessary steps be taken on your part to inform the
         Agency's Member States of the extent of the concern felt by the Arab region as a result of
         these activities. The Agency is also requested to make contacts with a view to carrying out
         the necessary technical studies to measure the radiation level at the site of the Dimona reactor
         and in its neighbourhood and at the nuclear waste burial sites in the area in an endeavour to
         prevent the potential hazards of nuclear radiation leakage, and to submit a report thereon to
         the Board.

<P>         
         In this connection, I should like to point out that the potential danger from any
         nuclear accident would extend beyond the region. The Chernobyl accident and its
         consequences certainly continue to be a source of concern to the world and illustrate the real
         importance of nuclear safety.
<P>         
         In view of the urgency and importance of this matter, we hope that necessary steps
         will be taken without delay, and at the same time we request you to circulate this letter to
         the Member States of the Agency as an official document.
<P>         
         With kind regards,

         Excellency,
<P>         
         I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 24 April 1996
         concerning the Israeli Dimona Reactor. As requested, your letter has been circulated for the
         information of Member States (INFCIRC/507, 8 May 1996).
<P>         
         As you are aware, the IAEA has been endeavouring to establish internationally
         binding legal norms in the field of nuclear safety. The Nuclear Safety Convention relevant
         to nuclear power reactors has recently been concluded and it is hoped that it will enter into
         force sometime this year. A Convention on the Safe Management of Radioactive Waste is
         under active preparation by an international technical and legal group of experts from the
         Agency's Member States. At present the Agency's role is limited to providing advisory
         services, facilitating exchange of information and developing safety standards. These
         standards, which are recommendatory in nature, are not, however, legally binding upon the
         Member States. It follows that, unless requested and authorized by a Member State, the
         Agency has no legal authority to make radiological measurements within a State or intervene,
         even in cases of nuclear accidents except with regard to an Agency project.
<P>         
         The Agency has been entrusted with certain responsibilities under the Convention on
         Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident. Under the terms of that Convention, Parties to the
         Convention are obliged to inform the IAEA and potentially affected States, either directly or
         through the Agency, of a possible or actual transboundary radioactive release that could be
         of radiological safety significance. No such notification has been received from Israel, as
         Party to the Early Notification Convention, relating to the Dimona Research Reactor.
<P>         
         Mr. Essa Al-Nowaiser

<P>
In view of media reports brought to our attention on a leak from the reactor, the
         Agency on 4 April 1996 approached the competent authorities in Israel to ask them to
         comment on these reports. As a consequence of that enquiry, the Israeli Atomic Energy
         Commission informed the Agency on 12 April 1996 that "The Ministry of the Environment
         [of Israell monitors the air, water and ground outside the perimeter of the Nuclear Research
         Centre Negev (NRCN) and to this day no radioactive leakage endangering the population has
         been detected. NRCN monitoring inside its perimeter ensures the same results" and that "the
         radioactive waste at the NRCN does not endanger the population, the environment and water
         sources. All the waste is stored safely according to the strictest international criteria and is
         constantly monitored. No contamination was ever detected".
<P>         
         Please accept, Sir, the assurances of my highest consideration.

</CENTER>
<P>         
COMPOSITION OF REGIONAL GROUPS (GOV/2864 and Corr. 1)
<P>         
 99.        The <I>CHAIRMAN</I> recalled that in 1995 the Committee of the Whole of the
General Conference had considered a draft resolution submitted by Israel in document
GC(39)/COM.5/10<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>l</SUP></A> to which had been attached a "list specifying the Member States
belonging to the eight areas listed in Article VI of the Agency's Statute". The Committee
had been requested to recommend to the General Conference the adoption of the list attached
to the draft resolution.
<P>         
         100. After an extensive discussion, the General Conference had adopted resolution
         <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r22.html">GC(39)/RES/22</A>, in which - inter alia - it had requested the Director General "to study all
         the implications of the proposal contained in document GC(39)/COM.5/10 and submit a
         report to the Board of Governors", specifying that the report should "take into account the
         general debate undertaken in this regard, especially the view that the primary responsibility
         for deciding upon the composition of regional groups lies with the respective groups
         themselves and the view that every State has the right to participate in a regional group".
<P>         
         101. In operative paragraph 2 of the resolution, the Conference had requested the Board
         "to consider this matter and report to the General Conference at its fortieth session"
<P>         
         102. The report now before the Board addressed itself to "the implications of the proposal
         contained in document GC(39)/COM.5/10", but it contained no recommendation for future
         action.
<P>         
         103.       <I>Mr. BENATTALLAH</I> (Algeria) said that his delegation, while appreciating
         the effort which had gone into the preparation of the report in document GOV/2864, felt that
         the report was in some ways incomplete, not covering all the implications of the proposal
contained in document GC(39)/COM.5/10 and not giving equal emphasis to the two views
         mentioned in operative paragraph 1 of General Conference resolution <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r22.html">GC(39)/RES/22</A>.
<P>         
         104. In his delegation's opinion, insufficient attention had been paid to the first view ("that
         the primary responsibility for deciding upon the composition of regional groups lies with the
         respective groups themselves"), despite the statement in paragraph 17 of the report that
         "According to information provided by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs, the
         composition of the various groups is entirely in the hands of the groups themselves". A
         country could not be forced onto a regional group, as was clear from the examples relating
         to various organizations which were given in the report.
<P>         
         105. A State did not belong to a particular region simply because of some list - and in any
         case, for internal purposes the Secretariat used several lists with Member States grouped in
         various ways on the basis of different criteria.
<P>         
         106. A number of points still needed to be clarified, and so his delegation regarded the
         report contained in document GOV/2864 merely as an interim report which it would like the
         Secretariat to refine, incorporating the arguments in favour of the first view mentioned in
         resolution GC(39)/RES/22. Meanwhile, his delegation would reserve its position in the
         matter.
<P>         
         107.       <I>Mr. BENMOUSSA</I> (Morocco) said that the informative report before the
         Board could be amplified along the lines indicated by the Governor from Algeria, but he did
         not think the Board itself should seek to amend it.
<P>         
         108. Among the arguments put forward in support of the right of every Member State to
         belong to a regional group of its own choosing was the importance of each Member State's
         being able to participate in the regional co-operation taking place in the region where it was
         situated. In response to that argument he would note that a Member State could participate
         in such regional co-operation without belonging to the regional group in question; for
         example, regional technical co-operation projects of the Agency were feasible without direct
         consultations among the participating countries of the region.
<P>
109. Another argument put forward was the need for political co-ordination among the
         countries of a given region, achieved through consultations at regional group meetings. In
         response to that argument he would note that, if a Member State was forced on a regional
         group by a vote of the General Conference, any consultations involving that State at
         subsequent regional group meetings were unlikely to be very fruitful.
<P>         
         110. Yet another argument was the right of every Member State to be a candidate for a
         seat on the Board. In response to that argument he would note that, according to a legal
         opinion offered by the Secretariat, a Member State did not need the blessing of any regional
         group in order to stand as a candidate.
<P>         
         111. The problem under discussion was not an Arab-Israeli problem. The list
         headed"VI. MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTH ASIA" in the Attachment to Annex I to
         document GOV/2864 implied an increase of two (Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) in the
         membership of the Middle East and South Asia (MESA) group, which was already
         recognized as being underrepresented in the Board, even before Article VI was amended in
         such a way as to increase the number of Board seats available for the MESA area.
<P>         
         112. In other words the problem of the composition of regional groups and the
         long-standing question of amending Article VI were linked, and he did not think that the
         Board should spend any more time on that problem for the present.
<P>         
         113.       <I>Mr. de YTURRIAGA</I> (Spain) said that his delegation was in agreement with
         the conclusions presented in document GOV/2864, if not with some of the arguments put
         forward there.
<P>         
         114. His delegation believed that, by virtue of the sovereign equality of the Agency's
         Member States, each Member State had the right to belong to one of the regional groups
         within the Agency. It also believed that the decision as to whether a particular Member State
         belonged to a particular regional group was not exclusively a matter for the members of that
         group; where differences of opinion existed, the decision should be taken by the General
         Conference.
<P>
         115. On the question of the regional group to which Israel should belong, there was no
         denying the fact that geographically Israel belonged to the Asian continent. The question
         would not be resolved, however, until a just, comprehensive and lasting solution had been
         found to the Middle East problem. In that connection, he expressed the hope that Israel and
         the other countries involved would abide completely by the commitments assumed by them
         as part of the peace process.
<P>         
         116. The question of the regional group to which Israel belonged was related to the
         ongoing discussion about amending Article VI of the Statute. Although the distribution of
         the Agency's Member States among eight regional groups was supposed to be based on
         purely geographical criteria, those criteria had been "contaminated" by political
         considerations in many cases, as was clear from the report contained in
         document GOV/2864. That was not so in the case of Latin America, however, which could
         in no way be regarded as an "ethnic-linguistic" - rather than a geographical - unit, being a
         territory where, besides Spanish and Portuguese, English, French and Dutch were spoken,
         not to mention aboriginal languages like Guarani and Quechua.
<P>
         117. The distribution of the Agency's Member States among eight groups was artificial and
         unjustified, and the distribution of the Member States belonging to the Asia-Pacific region
         among three groups was quite arbitrary. What justification was there for the creation of
         groups with two, seven and eight members when most of the other groups had
         over 20 members? Why did Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore belong
         to the South East Asia and the Pacific group while their neighbours Cambodia, Viet Nam and
         the Philippines belonged to the Far East group?
<P>         
         118. In the consultations on amending Article VI, his delegation had advocated the
         Agency's adopting the practice followed in the United Nations and most of the specialized
         agencies - the distribution of countries among the five traditional regional groups. That
         would also help resolve the legitimate problem posed by Israel.
<P>         
         119.       <I>Mr. AL-GHAIS</I> (Kuwait), having expressed reservations about the inclusion
         in the list headed "VI. MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTH ASIA" in the Attachment to Annex I
         to document GOV/2864 of three of the countries listed there, said that the membership of
a particular country in a particular regional group should not be based solely on geographical
         considerations; account should also be taken of considerations such as homogeneity and ease
         of consultations, in line with the view that "the primary responsibility for deciding upon the
         composition of regional groups lies with the respective groups themselves".
<P>         
         120. MESA was underrepresented in the Board, and any increase in its membership before
         Article VI was amended would only aggravate the underrepresentation. For that reason his
         delegation believed that it was too early to take a decision on the question of the composition
         of regional groups.
<P>         
         121.       <I>Mr. DOSHI</I> (India), speaking on behalf of the MESA group, said that the
         Board would be well advised to concentrate its energies on long-standing issues like that of
         amending Article VI; resolution of that issue would - inter alia - determine the future size
         of the Board and the future distribution of Board seats among the regional groups.
<P>         
         122. The MESA group believed that, in line with past practice, the responsibility for the
         composition of the regional groups rested mainly with the members of the respective groups,
         and it trusted that the Secretariat would not take any steps in that connection without prior
         consultation with the groups concerned.
<P>         
         123.       <I>Mr. ALTER</I> (Israel)<A HREF="#note_*">*</A>, expressing appreciation for the report before the Board,
         said that in it the Director General established unequivocally that every Member State was
         within one of the eight areas listed in Article VI.A.1 of the Statute and was entitled to serve
         on the Board of Governors, the rationale (stated in paragraph 7 of the report) being that "If
         this were not the case, a Member State that was not within an area would be ineligible to
         serve as a member of the Board. Such ineligibility would be contrary to the principle of the
         sovereign equality of all of [the Agency's] Member States, upon which the Agency is based
         and which is enshrined in Article IV.C of the Statute." Israel was not a member of any of
         the eight regional groups of Member States, and its eligibility to be designated or elected as
         a Board member had been infringed, which was contrary to the principle of the equality of
         all Member States.
<P>         
         124. In the report, the Director General also established unequivocally (in paragraph 25)
         that the determination that a State belonged - or did not belong - to a particular area "is not
         the exclusive prerogative of the Member States who are acknowledged as being within that
         area". Israel, although within the MESA area, was excluded from the meetings of the
         MESA group, which had thus been undermining the ability of Israel to participate effectively
         and on an equal footing in the Agency's activities, including its ability to consult and be
         consulted and to elect and be elected to various posts.
<P>         
         125. Regarding the question of who should decide on the composition of regional groups,
         paragraph 25 of the report contained a very straightforward conclusion: "Hence, under the
         Statute of the Agency, it is for the Board and the General Conference to act on the premise
         that each Member State belongs to some area." In the light of that conclusion and of each
         Member State's right to serve on the Board, his delegation hoped that the Board would
         decide, in accordance with the statutory principle of sovereign equality, that Israel was part
         of the MESA area and should be allowed to participate in the work of the MESA group. By
         doing so, the Board would be fulfilling its duty to act and put an end to a violation of the
statute.
<P>         
         126.       <I>Mr. JAMEEL</I> (Pakistan), associating himself with the statements made by the
         Governors from India, Algeria, Morocco and Kuwait, said that within the United Nations
         system geography alone did not determine the composition of groups; for example, WEOG
         spanned four continents.
<P>         
         127. As for Israel, which had raised the subject now under discussion, given its alignment
         it would belong more naturally to a group other than the MESA group.
<P>         
         128.       Mr. SNYDER (United States of America), advocating the transmittal to the
         General Conference of the Director General's report in its entirety, said that the report
         contained much helpful information on the composition of regional groups and that his
         delegation agreed with the conclusion (in paragraph 7) that "Article VI is premised upon the
         assumption that every Member State of the Agency is within one of [...] [the] areas" [listed
         in Article VI.A.1] . In that connection, his delegation believed that Israel belonged to the
         MESA area and shared the views just expressed by the representative of Israel.
<P>
         129. His delegation also believed that, as stated in paragraph 25 of the report, "The
         drawing of the conclusion that a State belongs - or does not belong - to a particular area is
         not the exclusive prerogative of the Member States who are acknowledged as being within
         that area, although account should be taken of the preference of the Members concerned.
         The full Board and the General Conference plenary is free to depart from such conclusion."
<P>         
         130.       <I>Mr. BENMOUSSA</I> (Morocco) said that the discussions on the question of each
         Member State's right to serve on the Board had perhaps created the impression that only one
         Member State had been prevented from exercising that right. He would note in that
         connection that 36 Member States had never served on the Board and that, in his view, there
         was no question of discrimination based on an international conspiracy.
<P>         
         131. Perhaps the matter could be resolved through the creation of an additional elective
         seat on the Board reserved for Member States which - for whatever reason - did not belong
         to any of the regional groups. With the creation of such a seat, regional groups should no
         longer be under pressure to take in new members against their will.
<P>
         132.       <I>Mr. MOHAMEDAIN</I> (Sudan) <A HREF="#note_*">*</A>, having associated himself with the statements
         made by the Governors from India and Algeria, said that regional groups should not have
         new members imposed upon them. Membership in a regional group depended not only on
         geography; political and cultural factors also had to be taken into account.
<P>         
         133.       <I>Mr. BENATTALLAH</I> (Algeria), referring to the statement made by the
         representative of Spain, said that the Board should not attempt to decide on the region to
         which Israel belonged; such a decision should be left to the General Conference.
<P>         
         134.       <I>Mr. P. WALKER</I> (Canada) said that the extremely useful report before the
         Board was quite unambiguous in concluding (in paragraph 25) that "The principle of
         sovereign equality of Member States requires that each Member State be eligible for election
         to the Board. Hence, under the Statute of the Agency, it is for the Board and the General
         Conference to act on the premise that each Member State belongs to some area."
<P>         
         135. His delegation agreed with that conclusion, not least because it believed that in the
         search for a lasting peace in the Middle East the real interests of no countries- and
particularly of no MESA countries - would be served by the exclusion of Member States
         situated in the Middle East and participating in the peace process from full involvement in
         all activities and responsibilities of the Agency.
<P>         
         136.       <I>Mr. AL-NOWAISER</I> (Saudi Arabia), recalling that the Director General had
         consulted the Board on the provisional agenda for the General Conference's forthcoming
         session and that the provisional agenda (GOV/2862) contained a sub-item entitled
         "Composition of regional groups", said that if the report contained in document GOV/2864
         was to be transmitted to the Conference for consideration under that sub-item he would have
         to enter a reservation about the report, including the list headed "VI. MIDDLE EAST AND
         SOUTH ASIA" in the Attachment to Annex I.
<P>         
         137.       <I>Mr. EID</I> (Lebanon) <A HREF="#note_*">*</A>, having endorsed the statement made by the Governor
         from India on behalf of the MESA group, said that the Board should determine its position
         on the question of amending Article VI before trying to resolve the problem of the
         composition of regional groups.
<P>         
         138. His delegation, which would like Article VI to be amended in the interests of greater
         democracy within the Agency through consensus in the General Conference rather than a
         vote, felt that draft resolutions of the kind submitted by Israel at the
         Conference's 1995 session in document GC(39)/COM.5/10 were likely to result in
         polarization rather than consensus.
<P>         
         139.       <I>Mr. OTHMAN</I> (Syrian Arab Republic) <A HREF="#note_*">*</A>, having endorsed the statements made
         by the delegations of India, Algeria, Morocco and Pakistan, said that one of the regional
         groups had in the past expelled a member which it had readmitted only after many years; that
         being so, other regional groups could hardly be denied the right to refuse to accept new
         members.
<P>         
         140. Most members of the MESA group were Arab countries, several of which were
         involved in the peace process. Unfortunately, however, the other country involved was not
         displaying any interest in a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. For
the time being, therefore, there seemed little point in discussing the problem of the
         composition of regional groups in the Board and the General Conference.
<P>         
         141.       <I>Mr. KHUDAIR</I> (Iraq) <A HREF="#note_*">*</A> said that a new member could be accepted into a
         regional group only if all present members of the group were prepared to accept it and that
         Israel had received Agency technical assistance despite the fact that it did not belong to any
         reglonal group.
<P>         
         142.       <I>Mr. AYATOLLAHI</I> (Islamic Republic of Iran) <A HREF="#note_*">*</A>, having endorsed the statement
         made by the Governor from India on behalf of the MESA group, said that the
         underrepresentation of Africa and MESA on the Board was the issue which - many years
         before - had triggered efforts to amend Article VI in the interests of a fairer allocation of
         Board seats. If the MESA group had to accept further members before an amendment of the
         kind which it desired was agreed upon, its underrepresentation would become even more
         pronounced. His delegation therefore believed that further discussion of the problem of the
         composition of regional groups should be postponed until the time was ripe.
<P>         
         143. Referring to the report before the Board, he said that every Member State might well
         have the right to belong to a regional group, but it was questionable whether an individual
         Member State had the right to impose itself on a particular regional group.
<P>         
         144.       The <I>CHAIRMAN</I> took it that, pursuant to the request contained in operative
         paragraph 2 of resolution <A HREF="http://www.iaea.or.at/GC/gc40/resolutions/1995/gc39r22.html">GC(39)/RES/22</A>, the Board wished to transmit the Director
         General's report contained in document GOV/2864 and its Corrigendum, together with the
         summary record of the discussion, to the General Conference.
<P>         
<I>         145. It was so decided.</I>

<B>Report by the Director General to the General Conference</B>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/16 of 23 September 1994, the
General Conference, inter alia, decided:<BR>
"to include in the agenda for its thirty-ninth regular session an
item entitled "Implementation of the agreement between the Agency
and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the Application
of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons".  This report is designed
to provide information to the General Conference in its
consideration of this item of its agenda.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>The Situation Prevailing with Regards to Safeguards
Implementation in the DPRK at the time of the Thirty-Eighth
Regular Session of the General Conference</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The Director General's report to the General Conference in
1994 in document GC(XXXVIII)/l9 recalled the overall developments
which had taken place in safeguards implementation in the DPRK
pursuant to the DPRK's Safeguards Agreement with the Agency
(INFCIRC/403), both with regard to inconsistencies between the
DPRK's initial report on its nuclear material subject to
safeguards and the Secretariat's findings and to the DPRK's
declared nuclear activities. The report focused in particular on
developments throughout the course of 1994 up until the time of
the General Conference.  These included problems over inspection
activities at declared nuclear facilities in the DPRK despite the
DPRK's acceptance, on 15 February 1994, of a detailed list of
such activities for providing continuity of safeguards knowledge
and later, the discharge of fuel from the DPRK's 5 MWe
Experimental Nuclear Power Plant, without the safeguards measures
requested by the Agency and in a way which seriously eroded the
Agency's ability to take further measures crucial to its ability
to ascertain whether all the plutonium produced in the DPRK had
been declared to the Agency. These developments also included the
continuous inspector presence in the Nyongbyon area beginning in
May. The report also covered developments following the DPRK's
withdrawal from the Agency membership with effect from 13 June
1994, notably, the DPRK's initially declared unwillingness to
accept further Agency inspection activities and the later
modification of its position in this regard. The Director
General's report to the General Conference in 1994 concluded with
an account of some positive developments which had taken place
early in September 1994, namely, oral and practical indication
that the DPRK was ready to enlarge the scope of inspections, as
requested by the Agency, at declared
         nuclear facilities in the DPRK. The report also recalled
that, at the meetings of the Board of Governors which had taken
place on 12 September 1994, the Director General and the
Secretariat were commended on their efforts to discharge their
safeguards responsibilities in the DPRK and were requested to
continue with those efforts.
<P>
<CENTER>
<STRONG>
Developments Over Safeguards Implementation in the DPRK Since the
Thirty-Eight Regular Session of the General Conference</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI> Following progress made during bilateral consultations
between DPRK and United States representatives, the DPRK accepted
enlarging the scope of inspections in early September 1994. The
Agency inspectors were given access to the Nuclear Fuel Rod
Fabrication Plant and the Nuclear Fuel Rod Storage facility for
periodic inspections, as required by the Agency. The inspectors
were also enabled, in addition to the other activities being
carried out at the 5 MWe Reactor, to enter the reactor fuel
storage to verify the fresh fuel rod inventory. However, at the
Radiochemical Laboratory, the DPRK continued to refuse to allow
the Agency inspectors to ascertain the state of completion of the
new process line under construction there and declined
examination of records and gamma-mapping activities.
<P>
<LI> Further, bilateral talks between the DPRK and the United
States in the autumn of 1994 culminated in an 'Agreed Framework',
(reproduced in INFCIRC/457) signed in Geneva on 21 October 1994.
This envisages specific functions for the Agency, notably to
monitor a "freeze on the DPRK's graphite-moderated reactors and
related facilities", to continue with verification activities at
facilities not covered by the freeze and to take measures
required with a view to verifying, at a later date, the accuracy
and completeness of the DPRK's initial report on all nuclear
material in the DPRK. The Director General briefed Members of the
Agency informally on 25 October 1994 about the potential
implications for the Agency of the Agreed Framework, inter alia
emphasising that such a bilateral instrument could not replace,
supersede or detract from the Safeguards Agreement between the
IAEA and the DPRK. The Director General similarly briefed Members
of the Security Council on 28 October 1994 . The Security Council
considered the Agreed Framework and on 4 November, the President
of the Security Council issued a Statement (S/PRST/1994/64).
Extracts from the Statement of direct relevance to the Agency are
attached at <A HREF=#annex1>Annex I</A>. Key points are that
through the Statement, the Security Council, inter alia:
<P>
Took note of the decision of the DPRK in the "Agreed Framework"
to remain a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and to come into full compliance with the
IAEA-DPRK Safeguards Agreement (INFCIRC/403) under the Treaty;
underlined that the Safeguards Agreement remains binding and in
force and looked to the DPRK to act thereon; noted with approval
the DPRK's decision in the Agreed Framework to freeze its
graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities; noted that
IAEA monitoring activities with respect to such a voluntary
measure are within the scope of verification activities under the
IAEA-DRPK Safeguards Agreement; requested the IAEA to take all
steps it may deem necessary as a consequence of the Agreed
Framework to monitor the freeze and; requested the IAEA to
continue to report to it on the implementation of the Safeguards
Agreement until the DPRK has come into full compliance with the
Agreement and to report to the Council on its activities related
to monitoring the freeze of the specified facilities.
<P>
<LI>At a special meeting of the Board of Governors convened for
11 November 1994, the Director General, in his written report
(GOV/2687/Add.9 of 8 November 1994) and in his oral Statement,
described the Agency's understanding of the freeze to which the
Agreed Framework and the Statement by the President of the
Security Council had referred i.e. that there will be no
operations at the facilities covered by the freeze and no
construction work of any kind, either at existing facilities or
new, related facilities; that the spent fuel from the 5 MWe
reactor will be stored and disposed of in a manner that does not
involve reprocessing in the DPRK; and that any movements of
nuclear material or equipment within those facilities, any
necessary maintenance work by the operator and any transfers of
nuclear material out of the facilities would have to be carried
out under the observation of Agency inspectors or under other
Agency arrangements. The Director General also recalled that
monitoring of a freeze, as requested by the Security Council and
as understood above can be performed by the Agency in the course
of implementing safeguards in the DPRK; the activities required
are part of activities which the Agency may perform while
implementing safeguards agreements. The main additional element
in the DPRK case would be the specific reporting to the Security
Council on the monitoring of the freeze.
<P>
<LI>The Director General's written report in GOV/2687/Add.9 to
the November 1994 Board meeting inter alia listed the declared
nuclear facilities in the DPRK to be covered by the freeze (<A
HREF=#annex2>Annex II</A> to this report), explained that other
facilities and installations included in the DPRK's declarations
but which are not covered by the freeze will also be subject to
safeguards, said that the Agency's current assessment of the
resources required for safeguards implementation in the DPRK,
including monitoring the freeze, would not much exceed the
resources now being spent and highlighted the practical meaning
of the Agency verifying "full DPRK compliance with the IAEA-DPRK
Safeguards Agreement" to which the Statement of 4 November 1994
by the President of the Security Council had referred.
<P>
<LI>The Director General explained that "full compliance" clearly
encompasses the verification of the accuracy and completeness of
the DPRK's Initial Report on the inventory of nuclear material
subject to safeguards and requires the DPRK to take all the steps
in this regard that the Agency may deem necessary to preserve,
intact, all information relevant to such verification, following
technical discussions between the IAEA and DPRK. The commitment
by the DPRK in the Agreed Framework foresees a delay before the
Agency is enabled to verify the accuracy and completeness of the
initial report and to verify full DPRK compliance with the
IAEA/DPRK Safeguards Agreement. However, the Director General has
stressed both to Members of the Agency and to the Security
Council, that it would be better for all concerned if
co-operation in this respect from the DPRK were to come promptly,
as required by the Safeguards Agreement. The Agency's ability to
verify full compliance with the IAEA/DPRK Safeguards Agreement
will depend substantially on the extent to which all relevant
information will remain available.
<P>
<LI>At its meeting on 11 November 1994, the Board of Governors,
inter alia took note of the Agreed Framework and of the DPRK's
decision therein to remain a party to the NPT and to come into
full compliance with the IAEA/DPRK safeguards agreement. The
Board also reaffirmed that the safeguards agreement remained
binding and in force; authorized the Director General to carry
out all the tasks requested of the Agency as outlined in the
Presidential Statement of the United Nations Security Council on
4 November 1994; and requested the Director General to report to
it periodically and to the Security Council as appropriate on the
implementation of the IAEA/DPRK safeguards agreement and on
Agency activities related to monitoring the freeze on specified
facilities in the DPRK. Subsequently, a technical team from the
Department of Safeguards, visited the DPRK from 23-28 November
1994 to discuss the verification measures which the IAEA has to
perform at nuclear facilities in the DPRK whether or not those
facilities are covered by the freeze.  During this visit, the
IAEA technical team visited all the nuclear facilities subject to
the freeze in Nyongbyon and the reactor under construction in
Taechon and confirmed that they were not in operation and that
construction work had stopped.  In his statement to the Board on
8 December 1994, the Director General recalled that these
technical discussions between Agency and DPRK representatives had
been useful and constructive and that implementation of some of
the measures required was already under way. He also said that
arrangements had been made to enable the Agency to meet most of
its objectives, although a few remaining areas required further
technical consideration and discussion with DPRK representatives.
<P>
<LI>To take all these matters forward, the Agency technical team
again visited the DPRK in January of this year. Discussions with
DPRK representatives focused on the implementation of the
verification measures already agreed and technical issues which
had been left open since November 1994. In the former context,
the DPRK accepted some verification activities, such as
containment and surveillance measures, which the Agency needs to
carry out to verify the freeze, but declined other measures,
relevant to the monitoring of the freeze, such as the taking of
measurements of liquid wastes at the Radiochemical Laboratory to
verify that there is no movement or any operation involving there
wastes and measurements for assessing the total amount of
plutonium in spent fuel rods from the DPRK's 5 MWe Experimental
Nuclear Power Plant. The spent fuel measurements should be taken
during the transfer of the spent fuel into containers for
storage. These measurements would also verify whether all the
rods in the spent fuel storage are indeed spent fuel rods. The
DPRK regards such issues as matters to be addressed later, when
the DPRK comes into full compliance with its safeguards
agreement.  In that respect, a difference continues between the
Agency and the DPRK as to the current status of the safeguards
agreement. The DPRK regards acceptance of measures required to
enable the Agency to monitor the freeze as not being under the
safeguards agreement but as falling solely within the context of
the 'Agreed Framework'. DPRK has further indicated that, until
such time as it comes into full compliance with its safeguards
agreement, the Agency can carry out ad hoc and routine
inspections only at facilities not covered by the freeze.
<P>
<LI>Notwithstanding the continuing difference of view between the
Agency and the DPRK as to the current status of the Safeguards
Agreement, the Director General was able to report in his
statement to the Board in March 1995 that verification measures
in the DPRK were proceeding at facilities covered by the freeze
in the way envisaged by the Agency with the exception of the
taking of certain measurements. The taking of these measurements
was an important issue for further discussion, expected to take
place in the Spring. Safeguards implementation had also been
facilitated for the Agency through the DPRK's acceptance of 10
additional inspector designations and continuous presence of
Agency inspectors at Nyongbyon. The Director General also
observed that another important issue, the steps which the DPRK
needed to take to meet its undertaking to preserve, intact, all
information relevant to the verification of the accuracy and
completeness of its initial declaration, had yet to be discussed
between Agency and DPRK representatives.
<P>
<LI>At the conclusion of its consideration of the DPRK item on
its agenda in March 1995, the Board, having taken note of the
Director General's remarks, welcomed the fact that further
technical discussions between Agency and DPRK representatives had
been scheduled for the Spring and hoped that further agreement
would be reached on the issues outstanding.
<P>
<LI>Unfortunately, the technical discussions scheduled for the
Spring did not take place.  On 11 April 1995 the Agency invited a
DPRK team to Vienna to continue technical discussions. In
response, the DPRK informed the Agency, on 20 April 1995, that
the Agency technical team should visit Pyongyang early in May. On
2 May, however, the DPRK informed the Agency that the DPRK
continues to regard the activities of the IAEA in their country
as directly related to the implementation of the "Agreed
Framework". In the DPRK's view therefore, at a time when
negotiations between the US and DPRK over aspects of that
bilateral agreement related to the light water reactor issue,
were at stalemate, there was little point in holding further
technical discussions with the Agency. The DPRK was nevertheless
aware that the Agency was ready to resume technical discussions
at any time.
<P>
<LI>The Director General reported this in his statement to the
June 1995 meetings of the Board of Governors; and informed the
Board about the inspections which had taken place, since the
March 1995 Board meeting, at three of the DPRK's declared nuclear
facilities not covered by the freeze. As for facilities covered
by the freeze the Director General reported that DPRK had
conducted maintenance work at the 5 MWe Experimental Power Plant,
and had indicated that they planned to carry out such work also
at the Radiochemical Laboratory.  The Director General concluded
his statement to the Board by saying that such maintenance work
as had so far been carried out had taken place in the presence of
IAEA inspectors.
<P>
<LI>At the conclusion of its consideration of the DPRK the Board
took note of the information provided by the Director General,
said it would like to see further technical talks between the
Agency and the DPRK taking place soon and wished to see agreement
reached on the issues outstanding.
<P>
<LI>Since then the Agency has maintained its continuous
inspection presence in the Nyongbyon area. After the conclusion
of the recent round of bilateral US/DPRK discussions on the light
water reactor issue, the DPRK indicated its readiness to continue
discussions with the IAEA technical team. The technical
discussions are planned during the week starting 11 September
1995 in DPRK. The topics suggested by the IAEA for discussion
during the forthcoming meeting include all the outstanding issues
of measurements and other implementation matters as well as the
Agency's requirements with regard to the information deemed
necessary by the Agency to be preserved intact by DPRK, so as to
permit in the future the verification of the accuracy and
completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration.

EXTRACTS FROM STATEMENT (S/PRST/1994/64) ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENT
OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON 4 NOVEMBER 1994, OF DIRECT RELEVANCE
TO THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY
</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
(a) The Security Council reaffirmed the critical importance of
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards in the
implementation of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (the Treaty) and the contribution which progress in
non-proliferation makes to the maintenance of international peace
and security.
<P>      
(b) The Security Council noted with satisfaction the "Agreed
Framework between the United States of America and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)" (Agreed Framework) of 21
October 1994 as a positive step in the direction of
denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and maintaining peace and
security in the region.
<P>   
(c) The Security Council took note of the decision of the DPRK in
the Agreed Framework to remain a party to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It noted also the DPRK's
decision to come into full compliance with the IAEA-DPRK
Safeguards Agreement (INFCIRC/403) under the Treaty.
<P>
(d) The Council underlined that the Safeguards Agreement remains
binding and in force and looked to the DPRK to act thereon. The
Council requested the IAEA to take all steps it may deem
necessary, following consultations between the IAEA and DPRK with
regard to verifying the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's
initial report on all nuclear material in the DPRK, to verify
full DPRK compliance with the IAEA- DPRK Safeguards Agreement.
<P>
(e) The Security Council noted with approval the DPRK decision in
the Agreed Framework to freeze its graphite-moderated reactors
and related facilities, which is a voluntary measure beyond what
is required by the Treaty and the IAEA-DPRK Safeguards Agreement.
<P>
(f) The Security Council, having received an oral report from the
Director General of the IAEA, noted further that IAEA monitoring
activities with respect to such a voluntary measure are within
the scope of verification activities under the IAEA- DPRK
Safeguards Agreement.
<P>
(g) The Security Council requested the IAEA to take all steps it
may deem necessary as a consequence of the Agreed Framework to
monitor the freeze.
<P>
(h) The Security Council also requested the IAEA to continue to
report to it on implementation of the Safeguards Agreement until
the DPRK has come into full compliance with that Agreement and to
report to the Council on its activities related to monitoring the
freeze of the specified facilities.

<LI>In Resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/17 on this subject, the General
Conference last year:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
commended the African States "for their efforts towards the
establishment of an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone" and
requested the Director General "to continue to assist them in
this regards".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In the latter connection the resolution also requested the
Director General:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"to report on the implementation of this resolution to the
General Conference at its thirty-ninth regular session  under an
agenda item entitled 'An African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone'."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This report is pursuant to that request.
<P>
<LI>In Resolution GC(XXXVIII)/RES/17, the General Conference
welcomed specifically the progress made towards the conclusion of
a treaty on an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone on the basis of
the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa, adopted by the
Summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its first
ordinary session, held in Cairo from 17-21 July 1964, and of
resolution A/RES/48/86 adopted on 16 December 1993 by the General
Assembly of the United Nations. In that respect it may be
recalled that, in 1993, the United Nations asked the Agency to
help the Group of Experts designated by the United Nations in
co-operation with the OAU by preparing draft treaty provisions
relevant to verification requirements in a future NWFZ in Africa.
The Agency did so. Last year's report to the General Conference
(document GC(XXXVIII/13) explained the Agency's activities to
this regard. A senior Agency official had participated in the
meetings of the Group of Experts held at Windhoek from 16 to 25
March 1994 and Addis Ababa from 11 to 14 May 1994 and assisted
with work on draft treaty provisions as relevant to verification.
<P>         
<LI>On 19 December 1994 the United Nations General Assembly
adopted a further resolution 49/138, which inter alia requested
the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in consultation with
the Organization of African Unity (OAU), to take action to enable
the Group of Experts to finalize the drafting of a treaty on a
nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa.  Subsequently, the United
Nations again requested the Director General of the Agency to
assist the Group of Experts in finalizing the draft treaty.
<P>         
<LI>Thus, pursuant to the request in resolution
(GC(XXXVIII)/RES/17 and as further requested by the United
Nations, the Assistant Director General for External Relations
participated in the further meeting of the Expert Group held in
Pelindaba, South Africa from 29 May to 2 June 1995. This was in
order to help the Group of Experts to continue to prepare draft
treaty provisions pertaining to verification requirements in a
future NWFZ in Africa.
<P>         
<LI>At Pelindaba, the Group of Experts reached agreement on the
draft text of a treaty establishing an African NWFZ. This text,
inter alia, would entrust to the Agency the task of verifying
compliance with the peaceful use undertakings of the parties to
the Zone. The report of the Group of Experts and the draft treaty
were considered by the meetings of the OAU Council of Ministers
and of the African Heads of State which took place in Addis Ababa
from 21 June to 28 June 1995. The draft treaty will be submitted
to the fiftieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.

<P>
1. On 18 July 1991 the Board of Governors, after considering a
report by the Director General on non-compliance by Iraq with its
obligations under its safeguards agreement with the Agency
(INFCIRC/172), adopted a resolution (contained in document
GOV/2532) in which it, inter alia, requested the Director General
to keep the Board and the General Conference informed of progress
in the implementation of United Nations Security Council
resolution 687 (1991).
<P>         
2. On 23 September 1994, the General Conference adopted, as it
had in the three previous years, a resolution in the operative
paragraph of which it requested the Director General, inter alia,
to report to the Board and to the thirty-ninth regular session of
the General Conference on his efforts to implement Security
Council resolutions 687, 707 and 715 (1991) (GC(XXXVIII)/RES/19).
<P>    
3. Pursuant to the above-referenced resolutions, the Director
General has kept the Board of Governors informed about the IAEA's
activities in Iraq and copies of the inspection mission reports
containing detailed descriptions of inspectors' work and findings
have been transmitted to the Board, to the IAEA's Member States,
and to the Security Council.
<P>         
4. The attached chronology by the Director General on "The IAEA's
activities concerning Iraq in 1994-95 under United Nations
Security Council resolutions 687, 707 and 715 (1991)" has been
prepared with a view to updating the information provided last
year to the General Conference in documents
GOV/2747-GC(XXXVIII)/10. The chronology provides an overview of
the major events that occurred during the period September 1994 -
August 1995, with references to the relevant documents.

THE IAEA's ACTIVITIES CONCERNING IRAQ IN 1994 - 1995 UNDER UNITED
NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 687, 707 AND 715 (1991)
</CENTER>
</STRONG>
<P>
<B>CHRONOLOGY</B>
<P>         
1. The twenty-sixth inspection mission in Iraq under Security
Council resolution 687 (1991) took place from 22 August to 7
September 1994. It included an investigation of Iraq's former
activities in the field of laser isotope separation and routine
inspections at sites associated with the former nuclear weapons
programme and marked the start of the continuous presence in Iraq
of IAEA's resident inspectors in connection with the
implementation of the Ongoing Monitoring and Verification (OMV)
Plan.
<P>
In May 1994, the IAEA received information from Member States
indicating that Iraq had invested significant resources into
uranium enrichment through laser isotope separation (LIS)
involving both molecular (MLIS) and atomic vapour (AVLIS)
technologies. The subject of LIS had been first raised by IAEA-7
(October 1991), in the course of which the inspection team had
received two written statements from a senior Iraqi official
denying that Iraq had undertaken any laser enrichment activities
and stating that, as a consequence, there were no Iraqi personnel
who had been involved in such activities. 
<P>
Although it was difficult to accept that, having explored such a
wide range of potential enrichment technologies, Iraq would have
completely ignored LIS, there was no evidence available in 1991
to support further investigation.  The information received in
May 1994, however, prompted a thorough re-assessment of the
situation. A detailed search for laser-related topics in the
current Action Team information databases identified a number of
activities with respect to laser component manufacture,
particularly CO2 lasers and the manufacture of components for use
in laser-related experimentation. The investigation carried out
by the IAEA-26 inspection team, which included five experts in
laser enrichment technology, extended over five inspection days.
The most significant event occurred during a seminar, presented
by the Iraqi counterpart on the fifth inspection day, when a
statement was made on behalf of Iraq to the effect that the Laser
Section at Tuwaitha had "received an objective [in 1981] from the
Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission [IAEC] to work in Laser Isotope
Separation.
<P>
.... We started in two lines; one which was looking after the
molecular and the other the atomic [vapour] direction". The IAEA
team was also advised that when the achievements of the Laser
Section were evaluated in 1987 it
was decided that the project should be downgraded to a "watching
brief" and that a number of key personnel should be transferred
to other projects, notably electromagnetic isotope separation
[EMIS]. The seminar provided a more detailed explanation of the
information given to the team in the course of the investigation;
the major difference being that its connection with LIS was now
acknowledged. One IAEC staff member, who had been brought to
Tuwaitha specifically to take part in the seminar, described the
work he had done on the photoionisation of sodium and rubidium.
This individual appeared to be highly motivated and technically
competent and described an experimental set-up that had a number
of features similar to those of the equipment described in the
information which had been provided to the IAEA by Member States.
The subsequent transfer of this individual to the EMIS programme
was consistent with the declared decision to downgrade the LIS
related activities.
<P> 
The IAEA team noted that, as now acknowledged by Iraq and
contrary to Iraq's written statements in October 1991 and the
FFCl report (June 1992), a specific task to explore the
feasibility of LIS as a means of producing enriched uranium had
existed. The task appears to have been poorly focused and its
limited achievements appear to be consistent with the equipment,
personnel resources and expertise available. The team was
satisfied that the information regarding the resources,
capabilities and activities of the Laser Section which it had
gathered during the investigation, was consistent with a loosely
co-ordinated and largely empirical approach to LIS, but was not
consistent with the achievement of substantial progress in what
is a complex technology. There were no indications that the
efforts of the Laser Section had reached the point of an
integrated experiment that achieved any isotopic separation of
either elemental uranium or UF6 or that they had developed even
the most rudimentary capabilities in either AVLIS or MLIS
technologies. It was also apparent from statements made in the
course of the inspection by the Iraqi scientists and senior
officials that export controls and voluntary refusals on the part
of several equipment suppliers had severely hampered the Iraqi
LIS activities by preventing the procurement from abroad of
critical pieces of equipment, most notably copper vapour laser
systems. A report on the twenty-sixth inspection mission can be
found in document GOV/INF/757.
<P>         
2. At its thirty-eighth regular session, on 23 September 1994,
the IAEA's General Conference adopted resolution
GC(XXXVIII)/RES/19 commending the Director General and the IAEA's
staff for their strenuous efforts to implement Security Council
resolutions 687, 707, and 715 (1991) and requesting them to
continue their efforts; noting that the IAEA was in a position to
implement its Ongoing Monitoring and Verification Plan (the OMV
Plan); stressing the need for Iraq to fully cooperate with the
IAEA in achieving the complete and long term implementation of
the relevant Security Council resolutions especially regarding
the Ongoing Monitoring and Verification Plan; noting in this
connection that the IAEA retained the right to investigate
further any aspects of Iraq's past nuclear weapons capability, in
particular as regards any new information obtained by the IAEA
and assessed as warranting further investigations; and requesting
the Director General to report the views of the General
Conference to the Secretary General and to report to the Board of
Governors and to the thirty-ninth General Conference on his
efforts to implement Security Council resolutions 687, 707 and
715 (1991).
<P>        
3. On 6 October 1994, the Director General transmitted to the
United Nations Secretary-General the sixth semi-annual report on
the implementation of the IAEA's Plan for Ongoing Monitoring and
Verification of Iraq's compliance with paragraph 12 of resolution
687 (1991). The report concluded that, with the establishment at
the end of August of the IAEA continuous presence in Iraq, all
elements of the IAEA's OMV Plan were in place. The conclusion
recalled that monitoring and verification measures would evolve
as technical needs arose and as advanced technologies became
available. The report further noted that implementation of the
OMV Plan did not foreclose the exercise by the IAEA of its right
to investigate any aspect of Iraq's former nuclear weapons
programme, in particular through the follow-up of any new
information developed by the IAEA or provided by Member States
and assessed as warranting further investigation. A copy of the
Director General's report can be found in document GOV/INF/753.
<P>         
4.   On 17 October 1994, the Director General addressed the
forty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly. In
presenting the IAEA's annual report he summarised the results of
the IAEA's activities in Iraq as follows:
<P>         
"Since May 1991, the LAEA has carried out 26 inspection missions
in Iraq under the mandate of Security Council resolution 687
(1991). Based on these inspections and the analysis of documents,
samples, procurement data and other information, the course of
Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programme has been thoroughly
investigated and charted. As also required by resolution 687, the
IAEA has completed the destruction, removal or rendering harmless
of Iraq' s weapons usable materials, facilities and equipment. We
are confident that, as a result of these activities, no practical
capability for the production of nuclear weapons remains in Iraq. 
Nevertheless the IAEA retains the right to investigate any
further aspects of Iraq's former programme if new information
should warrant such action. Concurrently with these mapping and
dismantling activities, the IAEA has been phasing in elements of
its plan for the ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's
compliance with resolutions 687, 707 and 715. All the elements of
the IAEA 's plan are now in place and a continuing presence of
IAEA inspectors in Iraq has been established at the Baghdad
Monitoring and Verification Centre, with the assistance of the UN
Special Commission. Monitoring and verification measures will
continue to evolve as technical needs arise and advanced
technologies become available. A mechanism for monitoring future
sales and supplies of designated items to Iraq has been jointly
developed with the UN Special Commission in consultation with the
Security Council's Sanctions Committee. Once approved by the
Council, this mechanism will form an integral part of the ongoing
monitoring and verification system.
<P>         
5. The twenty-seventh IAEA inspection mission under Security
Council resolution 687 (1991) took place from 14 to 21 October
1994. As mentioned in paragraph 1 of this attachment, since
August 1994 - i.e., concurrently with the twenty-sixth inspection
mission - the IAEA had established a continuous presence in Iraq
in order to fully implement the OMV Plan. This is accomplished
through the stationing in Iraq of a team composed of a chief
inspector and one or more experts to tours of duty at the Baghdad
Monitoring and Verification Centre (BMVC) established by the
United Nations Special Commission in consultation with the IAEA.
This evolution in the pattern of the IAEA's activities in Iraq
will entail a change in the mechanism for reporting to the IAEA's
Board of Governors, which has until now been based on the
issuance of GOV/INF documents containing detailed reports of each
and every inspection in Iraq. It is proposed that, starting 1
January 1995, the description of the IAEA's activities in Iraq
will be covered in detail only in the semi-annual reports (in
April and October) to the Security Council prepared in accordance
with paragraph 8 of resolution 715 (1991). These semi-annual
reports will also be issued as GOV/INF documents. It should be
noted, however, that the IAEA will, of course, continue to make
use of large inspection teams whenever special circumstances
warrant this form of inspection.
<P>         
IAEA-27 provided additional staffing resources to facilitate the
carrying out of the semi-annual radiometric survey of Iraq's
principal watercourses. This periodic survey is one of the
components of the environmental monitoring system established
under the OMV Plan to detect signature of undeclared nuclear
activities in Iraq. This survey had been initiated in November
1992 when a comprehensive baseline of the natural radioactivity
background of Iraqi main waterbodies was established on the basis
of samples taken in more than 50 sampling locations.  
<P>         
6.   On 16 December 1994, the Director General transmitted to the
UN Secretary-General the seventh semi-annual report on the
implementation by the IAEA of the plan for the destruction,
removal, or rendering harmless of the items specified in
paragraph 12 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991) .
<P>         
This report reflected the completion of the reprocessing of the
irradiated nuclear fuel removed from Iraq, which had been carried
out in Russia under a contract with the Russian Ministry of
Atomic Energy (Minatom). As provided for in this contract,
Minatom has reprocessed the spent fuel and downgraded the content
of the U-235 isotope to slightly below 20 percent. The recovered
material, amounting to a total quantity of 141 kilograms of
uranium (metal equivalent) was shipped to the designated storage
site in Russia and has been verified and sampled by IAEA
safeguards inspectors on 14-15 December 1994. With the completion
of this operation, the IAEA plan for destruction, removal or
rendering harmless of items listed in paragraph 12 of resolution
687 (1991) had come to its practical end. The IAEA retains,
however, the right to destroy, remove or render harmless, as
appropriate, any additional item of paragraph 12 list not
previously discovered or declared. Copy of the Director General's
report can be found in UN document S/1994/1438.
<P>         
7. On 5 April 1995, the Director General transmitted to the UN
Secretary-General the seventh semi-annual report on the
implementation of the IAEA's OMV Plan. In the summary and
conclusions section of this report the Director General stated
that:
<P>         
". . . [the] IAEA is confident that the essential components of
Iraq 's clandestine nuclear programme have been identified and
have been destroyed, removed or rendered harmless and that the
scope of the past programme is well understood. This assessment
is based not only on the verification of Iraqi statements, which
may be presumed to be biased and incomplete, but also on
information gathered during inspections, on information provided
by suppliers and Member States and, to a great extent, on an
analysis of the large cache of original Iraqi documentation which
was seized in Iraq by the teams of the sixth and seventh IAEA
inspection missions. Despite the absence in this cache of
original Iraqi documentation regarding its gas centrifuge
programme and the suspected withholding by Iraq of some documents
from the cache, the areas of residual uncertainty, regarding
Iraq's former nuclear weapons programme, have been progressively
reduced to a level of detail, the full knowledge of which is not
likely to affect the overall picture.
<P>         
The IAEA's extensive knowledge of the scope of Iraq's past
nuclear weapons programme has facilitated the design and
implementation of a credible and sustainable plan for the ongoing
monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with its
obligations under relevant Security Council resolutions.
<P>         
The Plan has been operational since the end of August 1994, when
the continuous presence of IAEA inspectors in Iraq - the Nuclear
Monitoring Group - was established. The refurbishing and
modification of the Canal Hotel in Baghdad to accommodate the
Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre is practically
complete and the Centre provides adequate facilities for the
implementation of the Plan.
<P>         
During the period under review [October 1994-April 1995], Nuclear
Monitoring Groups have conducted more than 160 inspections at
some 70 facilities, including 23 facilities not previously
inspected.
<P>         
A number of requests for the release, relocation and change of
use of equipment, material and facilities, to be used in
non-nuclear activities, have been approved, with the concurrence
of the Special Commission and in compliance with the provisions
of paragraph 3 iii) of Security Council resolution 707 (1991). 
Progress has been made in developing the export/import monitoring
mechanism called for in paragraph 7 of resolution 715 (1991) to
monitor any future sale or supply to Iraq of items relevant to
the implementation of Section C of resolution 687 (1991), to the
temporary restriction on nuclear activities in Iraq pursuant to
paragraph 3 iv) of resolution 707 (1991) and to the Plan approved
in resolution 715 fl 991)
<P>         
At the suggestion of the Sanctions Committee and in accordance
with the procedures for amending the Annexes provided for in the
Plan, the IAEA has revised Annex 3 thereof with the assistance of
international experts on export control. The revised version
reflects the need to provide customs and export control
authorities with a more detailed description of items subject to
notification.
<P>         
The Plan provides a sound basis for the ongoing monitoring and
verification of Iraq's compliance with the requirements of the
relevant Security Council resolutions in the area of nuclear
weapons and will continue to be developed as technical needs
arise and as advanced technologies become available.
<P>         
The implementation of the Plan does not foreclose the exercise by
the IAEA of its right to investigate any aspect of Iraq's former
nuclear weapons programme.  Indeed, vigorous exercise of the
right - provided in the Plan - to immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment,
records and means of transportation represents an important
confidence-building measure.
<P>         
Recent information made available through the media suggesting
the existence of a secret project which, prima facie, could be
related to a nuclear weapons programme, requires further
investigation to verify its authenticity. "
<P>         
At the request of the President of the Security Council, the
Leader of the IAEA Action Team introduced the Director General's
report to the Council at its informal meeting on 13 April 1995.
The full text of the Director General's report is contained in
document GOV/INF/770, dated 11 May 1995.
<P>         
8.   On 17 July 1995, the Director General transmitted to the UN
Secretary-General an addendum to the seventh semi-annual report
on the implementation of the OMV Plan.  This addendum had been
prepared at the request of the Security Council and addressed the
issue of five documents which an anonymous sender asserted to be
official Iraqi documents, generated in 1993 and 1994, and which,
according to the source, provided proof that a nuclear weapons
programme had been reconstituted in Iraq. A lengthy investigation
was undertaken by the IAEA aimed at assessing the nature and
veracity of these documents. This investigation entailed a
detailed analysis of the form and content of the documents,
including their comparison with the extensive database of
documents seized in Iraq during the sixth IAEA inspection; an
in-depth analysis of current and past correspondence and records
provided by Iraq; interviews with Iraqi personnel allegedly
involved, or known to have relevant technical competence;
interviews with private Iraqi civilians - not employed by the
Government; interviews with journalists associated with the
documents; and the carrying out of on-site inspection activities,
including environmental monitoring, using the most sensitive
analytical techniques.
<P>         
Based on the results of these activities and the IAEA's extensive
knowledge of Iraq's past programme and present situation, a large
number of errors and inconsistencies were identified in the
documents, typified by the following:
<P>         
<LI>Linguistic correctness and conformity with Iraqi practice:
<P>         
These documents contain technical wording which differs from that
found in the IAEA's extensive database of seized Iraqi documents
and terms which are not in conformance with standard Iraqi usage.
<P>         
<LI>Conformity of layout and construction of documents with
established Iraqi practices:
<P>         
The layout of the documents is not consistent with contemporary
Iraqi usage.  In addition, the documents reveal errors in
construction, suggesting poor adaptation of authentic Iraqi
documents.
<P>         
<LI>Scientific validity:
<P>     
Some technical elements of the programme, inferred from the
documents, have been assessed as unlikely by experts from
nuclear-weapon States. Some of those elements are also
inconsistent with available information on the status of Iraq's
clandestine programme during the last years of the programme.
<P>         
<LI>Accuracy:
<P>         
Significant inaccuracies in qualifications, titles and names of
individuals, as well as in technical and administrative
organisational structures, have been clearly established.
<P>         
The investigation undertaken by the IAEA and the basis for its
conclusions have been comprehensively documented. In view,
however, of the sensitive nature of the subject and of the
process, it is considered prudent to keep this documentation
confidential.  As a result of this investigation, the IAEA has
reached the conclusion that, on the basis of all available
evidence, these documents are not authentic. Furthermore, no
credible evidence has been found to suggest that the activities
reported in these documents were or are being carried out in
Iraq.
<P>         
It should be noted that the IAEA will continue, under its ongoing
monitoring and verification plan, to actively pursue any evidence
that might point to the conduct of activities proscribed under
the relevant Security Council resolutions.
<P>         
A copy of the addendum to the seventh semi-annual report can be
found in document GOV/INF/770/Add.1.
<P>         
9.    On 24 July 1995, the Chairman of the UN Sanctions Committee
transmitted to the President of the Security Council the report
called for in paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 715
(1991). This report was jointly prepared by the Sanctions
Committee, the Director General of the IAEA and the Special
Commission and sets out a proposal for monitoring future sales or
supplies by other countries to Iraq of items relevant to the
implementation of Section C of resolution 687 (1991). In the
covering note, the Chairman of the Sanctions Committee expressed
the hope that it would be possible for the Council to take an
early decision on the mechanism proposed in the report, so that
preparations, as necessary, could be pursued at the national
level for its implementation.

Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel Hassan Al Majid, the former
Minister of Industry and Military Industrialization of Iraq, the
Director General was invited to send an IAEA delegation to
Baghdad to acquire  new information. This information had been
purportedly held back at the instruction of General Hussein
Kamel.
<P>
<LI>On 17 August 1995, the IAEA delegation arrived in Baghdad.
Meetings were held  with Iraqi authorities who provided new
information and added further clarification concerning their past
covert nuclear programme. On 21 August 1995 the delegation
proceeded to Jordan where a meeting was held with General Hussein
Kamel.

<LI>Following the arrival in Jordan, on 8 August 1995, of
Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel Hassan Al Majid, the former
Minister of Industry and Military Industrialization (MIMI), the
Director General was invited by a letter dated 12 August 1995 to
send to Baghdad an IAEA delegation to acquire new information,
purported to have been withheld at the instruction of General
Hussein Kamel.
<p>
<LI>An IAEA delegation, headed by the leader of the Action Team,
went to Baghdad and held a round of talks with the Iraqi
authorities, from 17 to 20 August 1995. Statements made by the
Iraqi counterpart during these talks provided clarification of
some aspects of the previous clandestine nuclear programme and
identified a course of action that Iraq had initiated shortly
after the invasion of Kuwait. Had this course of action been
implemented through a crash programme, it could, assuming
satisfactory solution of the technical problems, have shortened
the time required to obtain sufficient nuclear material to
fabricate a nuclear device compared to the indigenous uranium
enrichment approach. Without prejudice to the result of the
analysis of the documents and materials referred to in paragraph
5 below, these statements, if verified, do not substantially
alter the conclusions in section VIII of the IAEA's seventh
semi-annual report to the Security Council.
<P>
<LI>Items of significance arising from the discussions are 
summarized as follows:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>It was stated that soon after the invasion of Kuwait (2
August 1990), a crash programme had been initiated aimed at
producing a nuclear weapon by using highly enriched uranium
contained in the safeguarded fuel of the Russian and French
supplied research reactors at the Tuwaitha site. General Hussein
Kamel was stated to be the initiator of this crash programme and
the deadline  for completion of the first part of the programme,
namely the recovery of the highly enriched uranium from the
reactor fuel and its conversion into metal, was stated to be
April 1991. It was also stated that when this programme had to be
stopped in the second half of January 1991 as a consequence of
the destructions inflicted by the air raids of the coalition
forces, programme progress was slow and all activities were
behind schedule.  Documents were provided to support their
statements.
<P>
<DD>It was confirmed that, as the IAEA has long believed, the
centrifuge enrichment programme was carried out in the so-called
Engineering Design Centre in Rashdiya - a locality in the
northern suburbs of Baghdad - and not  in Tuwaitha as heretofore
declared. It was also stated that some limited work continued, at
Rashdiya during 1988/1989, which led to the successful
development of a gas diffusion barrier. This latter activity -
discontinued in 1989 - is unlikely to have any practical
significance to the nuclear weapon's programme but is indicative
of the capabilities of Iraqi scientists and engineers and of
their perseverance despite repeated failures.
<P>
<DD>An oral description was given of the progress made by the Al
Atheer project team responsible for the design and fabrication of
nuclear weapons during the second half of 1990 including an
explanation of the extent of the contribution by the Al Qa Qaa
establishment in the development of the implosive package. To
help to substantiate their statements the Iraqi  counterpart
provided a copy of the progress report of the Al Atheer project 
team, covering the period from 1 June 1990 to 7 June 1991, which
had been issued on 10 September 1991. This detailed document, of
a total of 198 pages, is particularly important since it relates
to a period of time not covered by the documents seized by the
sixth IAEA inspection team in September 1991. The report, which
is in course of translation, appears to indicate that the work on
weaponization ceased at the end of January 1991, in Al Atheer and
in Tuwaitha and that post-war activities were concentrated on the
salvaging of equipment.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>While the assessment of the above summarized information will
take some time, it is clear that the crash programme would have
involved a blatant and readily detectable violation of the
Safeguards Agreement between Iraq and the IAEA. This  violation
was not committed because of the damage inflicted on the Iraqi
installations during the Gulf War. No safeguarded fuel was
diverted. It is however clear that the crash programme could have
reduced the time needed for Iraq to demonstrate its nuclear
capability, depending on the ability of the Iraqi scientists and
engineers to overcome the technical challenges involved in the
recovery of a sufficient amount of highly enriched uranium of the
necessary specification.
<P>
<LI>On 20 August 1995, when the UNSCOM/IAEA teams were preparing
to leave Iraq, the UNSCOM team was led to a farm, purportedly
owned by the family of General Hussein Kamel, where, in farm
buildings, the UNSCOM team was shown more than one hundred metal
trunks and boxes containing documentation and ton quantities of
metals in various forms. Cursory scanning of some of the trunks
showed the documentation to relate to technical and
administrative matters concerning the past programme and dealing
with all categories of weapons, including nuclear. These
documents and materials were removed to the Baghdad Monitoring
and Verification Centre during the following two days and are now
in the process of being inventoried  and characterized. It is
expected that their analysis and evaluation will require
considerable time.
<P>
<LI>Following the talks in Baghdad the UNSCOM and IAEA teams went
to Jordan in order to hold joint opening talks with General
Hussein Kamel.  The nuclear weapons related topics covered in
these opening talks, which took place in Amman on 22 August 1995,
included the initiation of the above described crash programme,
the stage of development of the centrifuge and other uranium
enrichment programmes and the nature of any activities continued
after the entry into force of UNSC resolution 687 (1991). In this
latter regard General Hussein Kamel's statement was compatible
with statements made in the Baghdad talks, that all nuclear
weapons related activities had effectively ceased at the onset of
the attack on Iraq by the coalition forces. It is expected that
further contact will be made with General Hussein Kamel in the
near future.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>I present herewith the Agency's accounts for the year ended
31 December 1994.  Part I contains the External Auditor's report
to the Board of Governors on the audit of the accounts. The
Agency's accounts, comprising Statements I to V and Schedules A
to G, are presented in Parts II and III respectively. Part IV,
entitled "Notes to the financial statements", describes the
purpose and financing of the various Funds and the authority
under which they are administered, and the significant accounting
policies applied by the Secretariat in preparing the statements
and schedules. In addition, the notes offer the reader
information about significant items and events which could have a
bearing on the financial position of the Agency or on the Funds
under its control.
<P>
<LI>The presentation of the accounts has been changed in a number
of areas where the Secretariat considered that the changes would
enhance their information value to Member States. Some changes
are also a direct response to the new accounting standards of the
United Nations system. More substantial changes may be expected
in the future, and after completion of the work of the
Consultative Committee on Administrative Questions (CCAQ) Working
Group on Financial Statements, which is formulating minimum
standards for the presentation of financial statements, schedules
and notes which could be recommended for use by all organizations
of the United Nations system.
<P>
<LI>Significant changes made this year in the form and contents
of the statements, schedules and notes are explained below: 
<P> 
(a) Statements III.B and IV.B show extrabudgetary contributions
received, comparing them with the amounts originally expected. In
previous years, the amounts shown were those received during the
year for which they were pledged; amounts received later were
excluded. In order to give equal recognition to Member States for
all extrabudgetary contributions, these have been included
regardless of when they were pledged.
<P>
(b) In previous years, Statements III.D, IV.D and V.2 showed
extrabudgetary and trust fund contribution receivables as assets,
and identical offsetting reserves as corresponding liabilities.
Since the resources in the extrabudgetary and trust funds are
kept on a cash basis, the receivables and the corresponding
reserves have been removed from the balance sheets because cash
basis accounting does not require the inclusion of accounts
receivable in balance sheets.
<P>
(c) In previous years, Statement IV.A presented figures relating
to Regional Co-operative Agreement (RCA) activities in a separate
line. However, since RCA activities fall under the headings
"Technical Co-operation", "Food and Agriculture, "Human Health"
and "Nuclear Safety", the figures relating to them are this year
reflected under these headings.
<P>
(d) Statements V.l and V.2 showing trust fund activities have
been summarized this year. The three existing trust funds - the
Research Institutes Trust Fund, the Technical Assistance and
Co-operation Fund in Trust and the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor-Engineering Design Activities (ITER EDA)
Trust Fund - are now shown in one line each. Full details
regarding each research contract and project are available to the
trustors.
<P>
(e) Schedule C.2 of the Agency's accounts for 1993
(GC(XXXVIII)/4), a summary of total income and expenditure for
the latest complete budget year, has been discontinued. However,
the information is available for internal management use.
<P>
(f) A schedule entitled "Administrative Fund - Regular Budget
Summary by Item of Expenditure" has been added as Schedule G. The
information contained in it is presented in greater detail in the
"Report on Programme and Budgetary Performance in 1994" being
issued separately under cover of a Note by the Secretariat.
<P>
<LI>The present position of the Agency with regard to the new
accounting standards of the United Nations system is explained in
Part IV (Note 2(k)).
<P>
<LI>Statement I.A.l shows an amount of $ 13 468 800 in respect of
1994 deferred programme activities which may be implemented in
1995. The extent to which 1993 deferred programme activities were
implemented in 1994 is shown in Statement I.A.2; an unused
balance of $ 3 446 190 was credited to the 1993 cash surplus. The
extent to which 1992 deferred programme activities were
implemented in 1994 is shown in Statement I.A.3; an unused
balance of $ 1 329 686 was also credited to the 1993 cash
surplus.  
<P> 
<LI>The budget year 1993 closed with a final cash surplus of $ 7
490 780, as shown in Statement I.C. Member States' individual
shares in this surplus are shown in Schedule C.  As decided by
the Board of Governors in June 1994, this cash surplus will be
retained until the existence of arrears of contributions ceases
to have a major detrimental impact on programme implementation,
but in any case not later than 1997, or until otherwise decided
by the Board (GOV/2734, Annex 4).
<P>
<LI>Statements IV.C and IV.D each include one new account:
Indonesia- to administer a voluntary contribution of money to the
Agency in support of Regional Co-operative Agreement (RCA)
activities.

<H2>Safeguards in the European Union: The New Partnership Approach</H2>
<I>The IAEA and Euratom are co-operatively applying NPT-type safeguards in more
cost-effective and efficient ways</I>
<P>
<A HREF=#author><B>by Sven Thorstensen and Kaluba Chitumbo</B></A>
<HR>
<P>
Nuclear safeguards within Europe have long been applied jointly by the IAEA and the European
Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). Over the years, arrangements have been progressively
devised for common safeguards activities involving the staffs from the inspectorates of both
organizations. These have included arrangements known as the "observation regime"  and "joint
team"  inspections under which Euratom inspectors performed inspection activities under the
observation of IAEA inspectors or jointly with them, depending upon the types of facilities being
inspected.
<P> 
Today, a new approach is in place, following critical reviews of both the effectiveness and
efficiency of the two former arrangements. A "New Partnership Approach"  (NPA) between the
IAEA and Euratom was agreed in 1992 to improve the working arrangements for the application
of safeguards within the European Union.  The NPA enables both the IAEA and Euratom to meet
responsibilities under comprehensive safeguards agreements [those that States conclude pursuant
to the <A HREF=/worldatom/glance/legal/npt.html>Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)]</A> in a more effective and
efficient manner. 
<P>
This article highlights the circumstances surrounding the birth of the NPA and the status of its
implementation. It particularly looks at elements of the NPA and practical arrangements that are
being followed for specific types of nuclear and related facilities. Since elements of the NPA
have been put into practice, significant savings have been realized in the allocation of safeguards
inspection resources for Euratom countries, while ensuring effective verification.
<P>
<H3>Birth of the New Partnership Approach</H3>
In the early 1970s, shortly following the NPT's entry into force, the IAEA and Euratom
negotiated an agreement for the application of safeguards in the Community's non-nuclear
weapon States party to the NPT. Some years ago, they devised the observation and joint-team
working arrangements. However, these arrangements have required a higher level of inspection
effort than desired and  have resulted in unnecessary duplication.
<P>
For example, a review of the inspections at fuel fabrication plants within Euratom   which
accounted for 60% of Euratom/IAEA inspection efforts under INFCIRC/193 (the Euratom/IAEA
verification agreement)   illustrates the problems. At two mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication
plants, under the joint team approach, the IAEA required 650 and 400 person-days of inspection
(PDIs), and at a uranium fuel fabrication plant, under the "observation"  regime, the IAEA
required 450 PDIs. Although these fuel fabrication plants are extreme cases, this level of IAEA
inspection effort was much higher than necessary for safeguarding such types of facilities.
Another example is the number of samples taken, transported, and analyzed in the separate
laboratories of the two organizations. In 1990, the IAEA took more than 300 samples for analysis
during inspections within Euratom, and it may be assumed that the number taken by Euratom was
at least equal to that taken by the IAEA. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that more than 600
samples were taken for analysis by the IAEA and Euratom, whereas only about half this total
number was necessary.
<P>
The duplication of resources is not limited to these examples. It also applies to areas such as
research and development (R&D) and training. In most cases, the IAEA and Euratom are working
separately in the R&D field. For example, both were developing different video surveillance
systems.
<P>
It was important to reverse this trend, so as to give effect to two of the basic tenets of the
INFCIRC/193 agreement, namely, that the IAEA and Euratom should co-operate in implementing
safeguards and should avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.
<P>
<B>Developing the New Partnership Approach</B>. Under Article 25 of INFCIRC/193, the IAEA and
Euratom established a Liaison Committee which meets as a High Level and a Lower Level
Committee. A Working Group was established by the High Level Liaison Committee in
September 1991. Its task was to examine ways and means by which co-operation and
co-ordination between Euratom and the IAEA in the implementation of INFCIRC/193 could be
enhanced. The Working Group prepared two reports which were submitted to the High Level
Liaison Committee in April 1992. It recommended discontinuation of the existing observation
and joint team arrangements and the initiation of a partnership approach, which should allow both
the IAEA and Euratom to meet their responsibilities under the NPT safeguards agreement in the
most effective and efficient manner. Furthermore, the Working Group recommended immediate
discussions between the two organizations on implementation of the recommended approach.
<P>
On 28 April 1992, IAEA Director General Hans Blix and Euratom's Commissioner Cardoso e
Cunha met in Brussels and endorsed the Working Group's recommendations. To this effect, they
signed an agreement that provided the necessary components of a New Partnership Approach
(NPA) which would lead to improvements in the working arrangements for the application of
safeguards. A Technical Group (Euratom and IAEA) was established to work out practical
arrangements and this work has proceeded since July 1992.
<P>
<B>Euratom/IAEA Liaison Committee</B>. The April 1992 NPA agreement also required the
re-evaluation of the role of the Liaison Committee and its relationship to its subsidiary bodies.
The procedures and working arrangements of the Liaison Committee established under Article
25 of the Protocol to INFCIRC/193 have now been revised to ensure efficient and effective
implementation of safeguards in the non-nuclear-weapon States of Euratom. The arrangements
were agreed upon on 26 November 1993.
<P>
<B>Elements of New Partnership Approach</B>. Under the NPA, the IAEA can be cost-effective without
delegating the inspection activities and the responsibilities essential to the fulfillment of the
objectives of safeguards implementation. (The IAEA performs all the required activities to meet
its safeguards criteria and draws independent conclusions). This is consistent with the IAEA
Director General's statement to the June 1992 meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors: "We
assume that arrangements which would be expressive of a genuine partnership would be
acceptable to our membership, while arrangements which would be tantamount to a delegation
of our safeguards tasks to our partners would not be acceptable. For the Agency, the principal
requirement is that an equal partnership must guarantee the Agency's access to all necessary
information and enable it to draw independent conclusions and obtain the necessary degree of
assurance and thus meet its own safeguards goals."
<P> 
The new approach is based <I>inter alia</I> on optimization of the necessary practical arrangements and
the use of commonly agreed safeguards approaches and inspection planning, procedures,
activities, instruments, methods, and techniques.
<P>
Other elements of the NPA are:
<UL>
<LI>increasing common use of technologies to replace, to the extent possible, the
physical presence of inspectors by appropriate equipment;
<LI>performance of inspection activities on the basis of the principle "one job, one
person", supplemented by quality control measures to enable both organizations to satisfy their
respective obligations to reach their own independent conclusions and required assurances;
<LI>use of commonly shared analytical capabilities in order to reduce the number of
samples to be taken, transported, and analyzed;
<LI>co-operation in research and development and in the training of inspectors with
the aim of achieving a reduction of resources spent on both sides and leading to commonly
agreed products and procedures.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Examples of practical arrangements</H3>
<P>
<B>Light-water reactors (LWRs) without mixed oxide fuel (MOX)</B>. A scheme for a partnership
approach for LWRs without MOX has been agreed which allows both the IAEA and Euratom
to meet their responsibilities under INFCIRC/193. The arrangements involve one physical
inventory verification (PIV), three intermittent inspections (IRIs) at quarterly intervals for
timeliness purposes, and necessary inspections for verification of shipments of spent fuel.
The quarterly IRIs can be arranged so that they can be performed in a technical and
competent manner by one inspector from either organization or can be equally shared by the
organizations.
<P>
Surveillance and containment measures with tamper indicating capabilities are used to assist the
IAEA to reach its independent conclusions. Euratom can install and remove the sealed
surveillance units at interim inspections. Devices that indicate locations are fitted to the
surveillance units to provide authentication of where the units are installed and removed. Work
is under way to develop a tamper indicating device for one system.
<P>
Reviews of the results of surveillance will continue to be performed by the IAEA and Euratom
together in Luxembourg. Both Euratom and the IAEA are making arrangements to acquire the
necessary implementation experience on selected LWRs without MOX. In parallel, preparations
for full implementation of the proposed arrangements are also under way.
<P>
<B>Low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel fabrication plants</B>. In LEU fuel fabrication plants, it was
agreed to perform one physical inventory per year and a certain number of plant-specific interim
inspections. Provided that the inspections and inspection activities are planned and structured in
such a way that the requirements of the IAEA are fulfilled, this number would not exceed five
routine interim inspections per year.
<P>
The development of unattended mode of measurements for LEU fuel assemblies is under
discussion between Euratom and the IAEA. This would enable 100% coverage of flow
verification of fuel assemblies.
<P>
<B>MOX fuel fabrication plants</B>. In one MOX fuel fabrication facility, the continuous presence of
inspectors will be replaced by a presence of four to five days a month while meeting all the
requirements for timely detection and flow verification. This will be made possible through the
use of technologies to replace the physical presence of inspectors by appropriate equipment. A
reduction of PDIs from about 410 (in 1990-91) to 150 per year is foreseen when all the
components are installed.
<P>
<H3>Savings under the NPA</H3>
The contribution of the NPA has been mainly due to discontinuation, for practical purposes, of
the observation and joint team regimes. Efforts have been directed to ensure that inspection
activities are planned to cover only the requirements of the safeguards criteria. The comparison
of PDIs between arrangements under the observation/joint team arrangements and the NPA for
selected facilities shows significant reductions. 
<P>
Examples of how savings have been achieved are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>the frequency of inspections of small facilities is limited to the requirements of the
criteria;
<LI>the number of inspections in LEU fuel fabrication plants is limited mainly to those
required to cover the requirements of the IAEA safeguards criteria and one inspector is used for
interim inspections. In one LEU fuel fabrication plant in Germany, PDIs have been reduced from
450 to 65 per year;
<LI>the principle of "one job, one-person"  is effectively utilized (supplemented with
quality control measures) at PIV inspections;
<LI>the follow-up and balancing of mixes (FBOM) scheme at one MOX fabrication
plant has been abandoned (the plant at present is not fully operating). The FBOM scheme
required high inspection effort and was manpower intensive. As a result, the inspection effort
requirements in PDIs have been reduced from about 650 to 330 per year;
<LI>normally one IAEA inspector is sent to interim inspections at one MOX fuel
fabrication plant (optimization of resources). The principle of  one job, one person  can be
effectively utilized, supplemented with quality control measures. The inspection effort in PDIs
has been reduced from about 410 (in 1990-91) to 290 in 1993. Further reduction is expected.
</UL>
Implementation of the NPA, coupled with the shutdown of two large facilities, has led to a
substantial decrease in IAEA inspection effort in the States in question. Previously, in 1990-91,
the effort was approximately 3000 PDIs per year. This has decreased to about 1200 PDIs per
year. In 1995, the remaining facility types are to be brought under the new arrangements, and
there should be further improvements in cost-effectiveness. The savings in inspection effort have
allowed the IAEA to direct resources to other areas   for example, for safeguards activities
involving the newly independent States of the former Soviet Union.<I> (See the article, <A HREF=thorstensen.html>Nuclear material 
accounting and control: Co-ordinating assistance to newly-independent  States</A>, also in this
edition.)</I>
<P>
Selected cost-effective procedures that have been developed under the NPA now are being tested
for use in other settings through the field trials of the IAEA's safeguards development
programme (Programme 93+2). <I>(See the article, IAEA safeguards in the 1990s: Building from experience, also
in this edition.)</I>
<P>
<B>Practical arrangements for NPA support activities</B>. Through the NPA, the IAEA and Euratom
also have agreed on arrangements for the following support activities: optimization of the
necessary practical arrangements and the use of commonly agreed inspection instruments,
methods, and techniques; and the use of commonly shared analysis capabilities to encourage
co-operation in training, R&D, and the use of new technology.
<P>
<H3>Technical effectiveness and co-operation</H3>
<P>
The technical effectiveness of Euratom's system and organization has enabled the translation of
the NPA elements into practical arrangements. The IAEA intends to continue to make use of
Euratom's capabilities to develop and establish optimal practical arrangements, thereby reducing
inspection effort while performing activities required by the safeguards criteria and drawing its
independent conclusions.
<P>
The technical effectiveness of Euratom's system can be illustrated by identifying some of its key
features.
<UL>
<LI>Euratom has a fully established system and organization based on more than 30
years experience.
<LI>Euratom carries out its functions through the continuous or intermittent presence
of its inspectors in facilities.
<LI>The range of activities performed by Euratom includes: inspections to cover
physical verification activities, flow verifications, verifications at strategic points, and audit
activities; destructive and non-destructive assay; establishing historical measurement data;
stratification and sampling plan preparation; material balance evaluation; application of
containment and surveillance systems; transmission to the IAEA of reports (physical inventory
listing, material balance report, inventory change report); design information verification and
re-examination; transmission of Euratom's findings to the IAEA under Article 21 of the Protocol
to INFCIRC/193; and follow-up activities on anomalies and discrepancies discovered during
inspections.
<LI>Other capabilities available in Euratom include: surveillance review station; seal
verification; calibration of instruments; destructive analysis laboratories; computer services;
research and development; and training.
</UL>
<B>Impact of NPA on the operator of inspected facilities</B>. The NPA bring a series of benefits to
the operator of inspected facilities in  non-nuclear-weapon States. They include:
<UL>
<LI>less intrusion for the operator;
<LI>reduced time and effort spent by the operator on safeguards activities and
inspection;
<LI>common inspection procedures and arrangements, thus minimizing conflicting
demands by the two inspectorates;
<LI>improved planning, thanks to the advanced transmittal of precise information on
programme activities (production, campaigns, shipments, receipts, etc.) by the operator; the
inspectorates thus can better plan effective and efficient safeguards activities and inspection
scheduling;
<LI>increased co-operation with the operator, which could reduce the presence of
inspectors at the facility.
</UL>
Could elements in the IAEA's New Partnership Approach with Euratom be extended to other
areas? It would be possible, as long as the necessary technical capabilities exist to enable the
IAEA to make use of and maintain independent conclusions. The IAEA's present activities for
improving the overall effectiveness and efficiency of its safeguards system provide an opportunity
for such an assessment.

The Agency also applies safeguards under two agreements (INFCIRC/133 and
INFCIRC/158) to the nuclear facilities in Taiwan, China.  Pursuant to the
decision adopted by the Board of Governors on 9 December 1971 that the
Government of the People's Republic of China is the only government which
has the right to represent China in the Agency, the relations between the
Agency and the authorities in Taiwan, China are non-governmental.  The
agreements are implemented by the Agency on that basis.

When Lyndon Baines Johnson spoke of the need to  "open the doors
of opportunity"  for people, he was quick to add that they must
also be equipped "to walk through those doors". From its
inception in 1957, some years before LBJ became president of the
USA, the International Atomic Energy Agency took on the twin task
of making nuclear technologies available to member countries and
of enabling recipients to use them safely. For decades the focus
of its <B>technical assistance</B> activities was dominated by building
capacity to utilize nuclear technologies in scientific and
research applications.
<P>
As other UN agencies were busy designing and delivering
development projects, IAEA technical assistance built basic
infrastructure national institutions, research units, expertise
and skills at all levels, interaction with other countries so
that each country would have the capacity to absorb and apply
nuclear techniques to resolve local problems. The option, you
could say, was thrust upon the Agency. Unlike other development
sectors, it was clear that few countries had even a semblance of
the required capacity. But beyond that, the IAEA reasoned, there
was not a strong justification for transferring technologies that
recipients would be forever dependent on foreign experts to use.
<P>
<blockquote>
"Anybody who is involved in economic development anywhere in the
world ... knows how critical human and institutional capacity is
to the development effort and the chances of success,"
</blockquote>
Edward V.K. Jaycox, World Bank Vice President for the Africa Region,said
in a 1993 speech. Providers of development assistance, he said,
"tend to use expatriate resident technical assistance to solve
all kinds of problems. Not only do these problems not get solved,
but I would contend that this is a systematic destructive force
which is undermining the development of capacity ..."  
<P>
Fewer than one quarter of the Agency's members have a nuclear
energy programme and most of those are developed countries. But
among the rest there is a clear interest to apply nuclear
technologies for economic development. 
<P>
The applications are now quite numerous, reaching ordinary people
almost everywhere and everyday. These technologies range from
treating cancer in humans to diagnosing diseases in animals, from
improving crop productivity to producing disease-resistant
plants, from controlling pests and eradicating pathogen carriers
to measuring water resources, soil fertility and fertilizer
regimes, from industrial applications such as measuring the
thickness of paper and the integrity of oil or gas pipelines to
those that affect us as individuals such as the quality of the
food on our plates.  These and many other nuclear technology
applications can produce significant social and economic benefit
for developing countries.
<P>
Under the Agency's traditional approach, each country, once it
had developed its capacity, would be in a position to identify
the problems that nuclear technology could best resolve; handling
the research and preparing projects for implementation.  A
government could ask for international assistance when it had
established what it wanted to accomplish.
<P>
In contrast, as Mr. Jaycox of the World Bank observed, much
technical assistance "is imposed, it is not welcome and there is
no demand for it really."  For example, the World Bank Group lends
US $4 billion a year in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1993 it had US $14
billion outstanding. The commitments were there, but no drawdown.
Why? "It's an issue of capacity," Jaycox said.
<P>
Of the 88 countries which now benefit from IAEA<B> technical
assistance</B>, the most advanced in nuclear science are those,
unsurprisingly, whose governments have committed themselves to
the task. Ghana is one of the best examples in Sub-Saharan
Africa, the region least advanced in application of nuclear
techniques. Similarly, Bangladesh, a least developed country
(LDC), is much more advanced in the nuclear field than some
developing countries. 
<P>
IAEA support for nuclear based development activities to these
two countries has amounted to some US $18million over the years.
These are paltry sums compared with total development assistance,
but Ghana and Bangladesh are now able to apply nuclear means to
achieve nationally important ends, and have already done so, due
in part to the Agency's concentration on capacity.
<P>
Now, after three decades of intensive focus on building
infrastructure typically through felloships abroad, training
within the country, research contracts, expert assistance, and
provision of laboratory equipment and facilities Agency <B>technical
assistance</B> is ready for a new partnership in <B>technical
co-operation</B>.
<P>
For the TC Department, the reasoning is straightforward:
<blockquote>
<I>"Adequate infrastructure including trained people in the field
has been successfully established in many countries. The next
step is adequate national capacity to take nuclear techniques
into the development arena. With strong government commitment and
the support of other partners nuclear technology can reach the
end users and effect significant social and economic impact. We
can no longer just transfer technology and hope somebody uses it. 
Its application must be part of a  programme to address major
problems and achieve lasting results."
</I>

A three-week cruise on the Caspian Sea this summer may sound
enjoyable but would misconstrue what is happening on the
Azerbaijan research vessel Alif Gadgiev rented by the IAEA.  This
is all work and no play.  As the ship moves slowly from the
shallow northern to the deeper middle and then the very deep
basin in the south, the passengers are using sophisticated
equipment to gather water samples at various depths and doing a
number of measurements and experiments.
On board are experts from the Agency and the Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, and participants from
the five countries that surround the sea (Azerbaijan, Iran,
Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan) who are doing the sample
taking and receiving hands-on training to do precise
oceanographic measurements and acquire the skills necessary for
follow-up activities. Such sampling, especially at great depths,
needs special equipment and skills.  Training in management and
collaboration among the disciplines involved chemistry,
oceanography, isotope technology and marine biology is also
included in the on-board course.
<P>
<center>
<IMG SRC="marine.gif">

<font size=2><I><B>Marine research: deploying a sediment trap</B></I></font>
</center>
<P>
The mystery of the Caspian's dramatic sea level rise since the
late 1970s remains to be solved. It has risen an estimated 2.5
metres in the past 15 years and is still rising at about 15
centimeters per year. The devastating consequences to the people
of this basin include flooding of harbours and coastal
facilities, changing groundwater flow of adjacent aquifers,
cholera outbreaks caused by stagnating sewage which cannot flow
towards the sea, pollutant build up from refining oil and salt
water intrusion into adjacent groundwater and agricultural soils. 
The increase in pollutants is affecting fisheries and caviar
production due to declining sturgeon  numbers.  The cruise, which
is also expected to provide valuable new data on the Caspian Sea,
is a small but important input in a massive programme being
knitted together by members of the UN family.
<P>
An international meeting called by the UN Environment Programme
(UNEP) in Geneva early this year concluded that a
multidisciplinary, multisectoral and intergovernmental approach
is needed to cope with a situation that is getting worse. The
comprehensive programme which is being finalized will be
coordinated by UNEP and involve many other UN agencies which have
visited the riparian states in order to establish government
commitment and active participation. 
<P>
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is preparing to
re-establish and upgrade the hydro-meteorolocal monitoring
stations in the region, especially in the Caspian's catchment
area, that have fallen into disuse or neglect since the break up
of the former USSR. UNESCO (the UN Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization) and the World Health Organization (WHO)
are also deeply involved because of the threat to national
heritage and human health.
<P>
The IAEA has a key role in establishing the <I>cause</I> of the sea
level rise, without which preventive, mitigative or curative
actions cannot be planned. The "cruise"  project, an Agency
initiative in which the IOC is taking part, will provide initial
baseline data from isotopic analyses of the samples it gathers.
<B>The Technical Co-operation Department of IAEA</B>  has a second-phase
project designed to produce detailed data on this phenomenon and
contribute significantly to the remediation activities planned by 
UNEP. 
<P>
Joining forces with other agencies is crucial to the
effectiveness of <B> technical co-operation</B> in efforts to apply
nuclear science in the social and economic growth of Member
States of the Agency.  Because the technologies are applicable in
so many areas, the Agency can seldom take the lead.  Instead it
sees itself as a valuable "partner in development"  in support of 
many areas of activity by UN specialised agencies. Collaboration,
with governments and development agencies, has become an
important component of Agency TC.  Its Model Project concept
provides a mechanism for realizing the socio-economic benefits of
nuclear technology.
<P>
The IAEA and FAO (the Rome-based Food and Agriculture
Organization of the UN) established a Joint Division in Vienna
more than 30 years ago. The recent FAO initiative (with UNDP
financial support) on global food security, has led to even
greater co-operation with FAO in Rome.  The TC Department,
however, wants to go beyond just transferring nuclear techniques
in agriculture; it seeks to carry their application through to
end users, using FAO connections with national agriculture
extension services.  Collaboration with WHO is expanding as well. 
One noteworthy programme is directed against cancer.  Cancer is
increasing worldwide and the greatest increase is in the
developing world. By 2010 approximately two-thirds of new cases
will be in developing countries. 
<P>
Given their different mandates, WHO and IAEA have played
different but significant roles in the fight against cancer. WHO
has concentrated on diagnosis and treatment while transfer of
technology and equipment for radiological methods such as
teletherapy and brachytherapy has been left exclusively to the
IAEA.
<P> 
Early diagnosis is vital for successful treatment.  For example
cervical cancer is decreasing in the developed world because of
early diagnosis.  Many cases that come to cancer treatment
centres in developing countries are too far advanced to permit
treatment.  A new WHO/IAEA collaboration is planned to develop
national diagnostics and radiotherapy systems for health
maintenance programmes in several developing countries.
Collaboration with others organizations of the UN family has not
been easy, but many new projects have been launched recently or
are being developed.  One such initiative with the UN Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) seeks to set up a pilot facility
to produce sterile male tsetse flies in Africa. Tsetse flies
infest 36 countries and a total area of 10 million square
kilometres in Africa.
<P>
<center>
<img src="flies.gif">
<br>
<font size=2><B><I>Loading sterilized flies for areal release</I></B></font>
</center>
<P>
Throughout this area the disease transmitted by the tsetse fly
has a devastating effect on huge numbers of livestock.  The
sterile insect technique (SIT), which involves releasing
sterilized males to challenge the fertile wild ones as mates, has
the potential to eradicate the pest in significant portions of
Africa where tsetse infestation is seriously affecting human and
animal health, and economic productivity. IAEA has the ability to
transfer technology to breed and sterilise the flies on a massive
scale to combat this devastating pest, while UNIDO is assessing
the capacity to industrialize this process as a national activity
which is essential for sustainability.  UNDP has the field
network to organize the activity on a regional and sub-regional
level.
<P> 
Several projects have sought to control tsetse fly populations,
but not as yet eradicate them over truly large areas. Eradication
will bring highly desirable consequences to African social and
economic development and also for the environment which would be
spared of chemical control effects.  Much remains to be done in
conjunction with planning, organization, infrastructure
development relating to fly rearing, release, monitoring and
maintenance.  However, the success of FAO and other international
partners such as the European Union in controlling tsetse fly
species creates a favorable situation for full eradication,
especially with the strong commitment of governments, national
counterparts and extension services.

Bangladesh scientists recently made a frightening find. Dried
fish sold across the country contained DDT. Some samples analyzed
at the Agency-established Pesticide Residue Laboratory of the
Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC) had 100 times what was
the permissible level before DDT use was internationally banned,
including in Bangladesh, some 20 years ago. By then, DDT the
oldest synthetic organic pesticide and the most widely used
worldwide  had got into virtually everything alive, from the eggs
of soaring eagles to fish several kilometers down in the oceans.
It was reported that by the early 1970s the milk of most mothers
in the United States had so much DDT that, under US commercial
regulations, it could be prevented from crossing from one state
to another.
<P>
<center>
<img src="fish.gif">
<br>
<font size=2><I><B>Dried fish is an important source of protein</B></I>
</font>
</center>
<P>
The DDT in the dried fish, Bangladesh's main source of animal
protein, did not get there by chance from a residual. It was put
there, by traders, to kill insect larvae that normally infest the
sun dried fish and reduce them to bones in a few weeks. Dipping
in (or spraying) DDT could extend the shelflife of the commodity
to several months. Where they get the pesticide from has not been
established. Despite its long name, <I>dichlorodiphenyl
trichloroethane</I>, DDT is based on a simple compound found in
natural gas and can be produced in a backyard laboratory. The
damage it can do to human health is considerable. But what to do,
beyond policing and cracking down on the use of the already
banned substance?
<P>
Happily Bangladesh does have the means to preserve dried fish for
many months, without using DDT: a demonstration and partly
commercial multi-purpose (food and medical supplies) irradiation
facility. The 80 000 curie Russian-built plant, paid for from TC
funds, began operating in March 1993. Sited in Chittagong, in the
heart of the fishing region, it could treat all the dried fish
the country produces. Irradiation after packaging would keep the
food undamaged by larvae and cleansed of pathogens as well. The
government's emerging strategy to ensure that DDT is not used
includes both compelling the traders to use the facility and
enabling them to do so.  In fact it embraces other foods which
are treated with other toxic substances after harvest. 
<P>
Bangladesh is a least developed country (LDC) as defined by the
UN, but in nuclear terms it is more advanced than many in the
developing category. The key reason is governmental commitment to
invest in the atom.  Apart from the irradiation facility, it
operates a research reactor, a linear accelerator and a neutron
generator. The build-up of capacity to absorb nuclear technical
help began when an atomic energy centre was set up in Dhaka in
1965, when the country was still East Pakistan.
<P>
BAEC, formed in 1973, two years after separation from Pakistan,
has set up many facilities (including an institute of nuclear
medicine and 11 nuclear medicine centres, a radiation testing
laboratory, and an atomic energy research facility) and guided an
extensive research and development programme. It can now train
scientists, engineers and technicians in nuclear physics,
chemistry, electronics, medicine, radiation biology, isotope
applications in agriculture and industry and other fields for its
own activities as well for others in the public and private
sectors. IAEA <B>technical co-operation</B> assists in-country
group training and funds fellowships abroad for top specialists.
<P>
BAEC's institute of food and radiation biology began research on
human tissue grafting in 1985, with IAEA <B>technical
co-operation</B> help. Over the years items from its tissue
bank of bones, cartilage, embryonic tissue, ligaments,
skin sterilized by radiation, have been successfully used on more
than 400 patients in Bangladesh hospitals. Tissue banking has
developed over the past 40 years and today there are more than
100 banks worldwide. One of them is in this LDC.

A major new drive by the Vienna-based Joint Division of the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the IAEA is to increase
crop yields while using less chemical fertilizer which is both
expensive and harmful to the environment. In Bangladesh the
ultimate target crop is rice. But it has started on legumes, the
principal protein source of the poor. Legumes have the natural
ability to absorb nitrogen not only from the soil (and from
fertilizers put there) but from the air. In fact this "fixing"  of
atmospheric nitrogen (N<SUPER><FONT SIZE=-5>2</FONT></SUPER>) is done by a bacterium called rhizobium
in the soil. All legume plants seem to recognize rhizobia as
alien, and form nodules around the bacteria at their roots. But
the bacteria are benign and those in nodules go on fixing N<SUPER><FONT SIZE=-5>2</FONT></SUPER> in
forms usable by the plant.
<P>
<center>
<img src="farmer.gif">
<br>
<font size=2><B><I>Bangladeshi farmer and family at the edge of his lentil field</i></B></font>
</center>
<P>
The more nodules the better the plant thrives and the more
protein it provides for humans and animals. The number of nodules
is proportionate to the density of rhizobia in the soil. Since
1988 IAEA <B>technical co-operation</B> has aided the Bangladesh
Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA) in a project to improve
its rhyzobiology capacity and take on the research and
development to maximize this gift of nature. BINA has identified
elite genotypes of grain legumes which, in combination with
appropriate strains of rhizobia, can fix greater amounts of
nitrogen than the traditionally used local cultivars, and shown
that yields of chickpea, groundnut and lentil can be increased
significantly.
<P>
Using a unique nitrogen-15 (N<SUPER><FONT SIZE=-5>15</FONT></SUPER>) technique developed by the
FAO/IAEA Joint Division, the BINA studies have also shown that
application of a <B>biofertilizer</B> of peat and the best
strains of local rhizobia for lentils, chickpea and groundnut can
add 70-100 kilograms per hectare of atmospheric nitrogen to the
soil through biological fixation. This is about what 150-200
kg/ha of urea would provide. Urea costs US$20-25 per hectare, the
biofertilizer $3-4. And the biofertilizer has none of the
environmentally harmful effects of commercial nitrogen
fertilizer. Lentils, chickpea and groundnut are grown on 357,000
hectares in Bangladesh (roughly half the area covered by all
pulses). The amount of biofertilizer (rhizobia plus peat) needed,
if chemicals are replaced in the total area, is estimated to be
750 tonnes a year. 
<P>
Until the introduction of Model Projects, such experimental findings might have remained in the
institute, waiting for someone to come along and use them. In
this case a model project called <I>biofertilizers for increased
legume production</I> was launched this year. With seed money and
some technical help from TC in the first three years, it is
expected to generate its own funds through a contract mechanism
with the private sector to sustain its future activities.
<P>
The idea is for BINA, the Ministry of Agriculture and private
companies to collaborate and steadily build-up both the farmers'
capacity to use the biofertilizers (different mixes for different
legume crops) as well as the country's capacity to produce them.
Both will require successive and widespread field trials to
evaluate what is best for where. On the production side, BINA
already has a pilot-scale factory with three small (100 litre)
fermenters needed for rhizobia production, each able to produce
5-8 tonnes a year of bacteria-plus-carrier which would be
sufficient for the early trials. Decisions on large scale
production of biofertilizer and a large scale programme for
sustainable legume production will not be taken until all the
findings of the first two years (1995 and 1996) are in. But the
government is committed to introduce a biofertilizer industry in
Bangladesh. It is hoped to attract private investors in setting
up a commercial scale plant with technical and scientific support
from BINA.
<P>
IAEA technical co-operation will provide expert services to
support the production of high quality biofertilizer, as well as
some equipment and supplies, mainly inoculum fermenters and N<SUPER><FONT SIZE=-5>15</FONT></SUPER>15
labelled fertilizer for field testing. Its total contribution
over three years, including fellowships and scientific visits, is
budgeted at $151,650. For Bangladesh, which will invest much more
in various ways,  increasing legume production by about 25%
through the use of biofertilizer could lead to savings of about
$25 million on imported legumes and about $6 million on chemical
fertilizers. The returns in terms of a new industry, employment
opportunities, and environment friendly sustainable legume
cultivation, are more difficult to quantify.

Having taken the step to enter the wider arena of development,
utilizing its expertise and the capacities of  its counterpart
national nuclear bodies in a new partnership in development, the
<B>Technical Co-operation (TC) Department</B> realized it needed
a new vehicle.  The road was clear.  While many other development
agencies continued to complain of lack of national capacity, many
of the TC Department's national counterparts already had the
skills and infrastructure to apply nuclear techniques, especially
in the priority areas of human health and agriculture.
<P>
The vehicle for applying nuclear technologies in social-economic
development is what the TC Department calls its <B>Model
Project</B>.  In the past two years 23 Model Projects have been
launched.  The inauguration on 1 June this year of China's first
industrial scale irradiation plant to be used for disinfestation
of foodstuffs, mainly rice, reflects the success of one. Like all
Model Projects, it has immediate practical benefit to the
national economy.  It is sustainable with national expertise and
the technology has comparative advantage over con- ventional
approaches.
<P>
The Chinese Government's strategy is to expand food irradiation
applications once this pioneer project has demonstrated that the
technology is economical and effective.  Growing demand for
quality foods has led to increasing restrictions on conventional
methods of disinfestation (insecticides and chemical fumigation)
which are harmful to human and environmental health. Irradiation
offers a safe and effective means of achieving greater crop
utility and value.  For the IAEA the Model Project is the next
stage in the evolution of its technical co-operation programme,
from the transfer of technology to a partnership in national
development. The MP concept, still being fine tuned, takes the
results of nuclear science all the way to end users such as
farmers, health services, industries.
<P> 
For example, research by Mali scientists has produced mutations
of native rice and sorghum that give higher yields than those now
cultivated and are of a quality that is more attractive to
consumers and more valuable to farmers.  The TC Department
provided expertise, equipment and training to accomplish this
breakthrough.  If the new seeds prove vigorous and can be widely
distributed, farmers would earn more and the country's imports
would be reduced.  How to demonstrate the viability of the mutant
seeds for the farmer? This is the thrust of a Model Project
started this year, in which the government, particularly the
Agriculture Ministry, is the primary motivator. The key
prerequisites of all Model Projects are that they receive strong
national commitment, respond to national development plans and be
of practical value to specified end users.
<P> 
Model projects are based on national capacities and designed to
address national priority needs. The TC Department proposes
application of nuclear techniques only where they are clearly
advantageous or at least cost-effective compared to other means
to ends that achieve results.  The government must fully commit
to the Model Projects objectives: construct building and
facilities, provide national project personnel and even
contribute in cash.  China put in a massive US$1,015,500 of a
total cost of $1,331,300 for the irradiation plant. The share in
cash may vary, but all governments must provide substantial
contributions.  Additionally, Model Projects are designed to be
completed in a few years, therefore governments must be prepared
to sustain the activity after support from the Agency is
discontinued, and also be able to do so with minimal
international funds and expertise.
<P>
While the IAEA can develop basic national infrastructure and
initiate projects that demonstrate the effectiveness of a
particular nuclear technique to achieve national objectives, its
resources are not sufficient to reach all end-users and
situations in which the technologies are demonstrably useful. 
Many funding agencies have the opposite problem: finding good and
clearly implementable projects which the government has the
capacity to absorb.The Model Project concept provides a framework
and opportunity for donors and development agencies to become
partners in IAEA TC activities. Recent experience and discussions
with top funding agencies have indicated that significant amounts
of bilateral and multilateral assistance, already made available
but unutilized by some IAEA Member Countries, could be redirected
into IAEA <B>technical co-operation</B> projects that could be
absorbed with significant socio-economic impact. The IAEA's
Technical Co-operation Department has developed the tools to
bring the benefit of nuclear technology to the doorstep of
developmental objectives in food security, environmental quality,
health, industry and poverty alleviation.  The only thing missing
is the opportunity to develop the full potential of this
important contribution to human development.

As it prepared for the transition from basic technology transfer
to developmental partnership, the IAEA's Technical Co-operation
Department also looked <I>inward</I>.  Peer review was an
important com- ponent for  improving efficiency and enhancing the
relevance of Agency TC activities.
<P>
The Model Projects initiative has established a new standard for
the Agency's technical co-operation activities based on national
priorities and providing end-users with new and powerful
technical solutions. They have also served to orientate Agency
staff to seeing nuclear technology not as an end in itself, but
as a means to achieve improvements in the human condition.
<P>
The Department's new strategy to spread the Model Project concept
throughout the TC programme and involve additional Agency
technical officers, national nuclear counterparts, and officials
of recipient countries includes two initiatives country
programming and thematic planning.  These initiatives will
identify where nuclear technologies can be most effective and
concentrate assistance on  fewer but better  projects in order to
create significant national impacts through strengthened 
commitment to priority activities, better co-ordination with
other UN organizations <B>at country level</B> and interacting
more effectively with donors and funding agencies.
<P>
Co-ordination between TC and other IAEA Departments (such as
Research & Isotopes or Nuclear Safety) is also being enhanced,
especially with those Divisions and Sections having a role in
implementing TC projects.  Each project has a project officer
from the Technical Co-operation Department and a technical
officer who could be from any one of the technical divisions of
another Department.  Regular meetings between technical and
programme staff have speeded up the project implementation
process significantly as witnessed by the rate of financial
implementation for Technical Co-operation Fund (TCF) resources of
almost 72%.
<P>
The Department was concerned about the large number of projects
not implemented on schedule and the annual carry-over of
unutilized resources.  There was an unacceptable gap between
project approval and implementation caused by delays in getting
the prerequisites for the first six months of projects expert job
descriptions, specifications for equipment procurement,
workplans, fellowship applications and the like.  Improved
technical liaison has cut those delays.  In 1994, project
prerequisites were sought and received for a substantial number
of proposed projects between 3-6 months earlier than in previous
years, yielding an important  head start  in project
implementation of the 1995-96 Programme.

In March this year Ghana started-up its first research reactor,
32 years after a grand design to install a much larger one from
the then Soviet Union was aborted. The new Chinese-built reactor
is truly `mini', with a capacity of only 30 kilowatts. Commonly
research reactors have megawatt-plus capacity. But Ghana has made
enormous strides in nuclear science in recent years and has the
capacity to make maximum use of it. An important activity for the
national economy would be neutron activation analysis (NAA)
techniques, using neutrons produced by this research  reactor to
assay rocks, sands, soils, and help identify mineral resources
such as bauxite and manganese which are very important to the
Ghanaian economy.
<P> 
NAA techniques will also be applied to assess the quality of the
environment, water, and food supplies, both imported and locally
produced. NAA can determine minuscule particles of elemental and
other impurities in a sample very rapidly and accurately, far
beyond the capability of conventional chemical methods. Using the
research reactor Ghanaian scientists are now able to perform
these analyses. The procedure includes spectral analysis  to find
out what elements are present and in what concentration in the
whole sample. But this requires computer software. Shortly after
the reactor was started up, Ghanaian technicians adapted a
software that the agency had developed for spectral analysis.
Since then a dedicated software package specially designed by the
Chinese for NAA in this reactor type has been installed.
<P>
The other key activity for the reactor is radioisotope
production. Many radioactive isotopes are routinely used in
agriculture, health care, hydrology and other fields. They are
commonly produced in nuclear research reactors with a minimum
flux density of neutrons. Although it is small the reactor in
Ghana has the flux density to produce certain specific
radioisotopes, though not on a commercial scale. Most importantly
the mini reactor will be used for research and training,
increasing Ghana's skilled manpower and upgrading expertise.

The crops that feed us today evolved over millions of years.
Their early ancestors often had to contend with extremely hostile
conditions such as salinity, drought, frost, heat, and
waterlogging.  Only those that had the right genetic make-up
survived. Later, as climate conditions became more comfortable,
there was less need for those hardy genes. But plant scientists
believe they are not dead, just dormant, and that if crop plants
are suitably challenged the appropriate genes would be aroused
from slumber.
<P>
The need to awaken these  inducible  genes is becoming urgent.
The burgeoning human population has to be fed. Demand for living
space adds to the need for more crops to be grown on less land,
in nutrient-depleted soils, in areas prone to increased flooding
or drought, heat and cold. Already some 40 per cent of cropland
worldwide suffers from salinity, another 20% from acidity.
<P>
In mid-1994, the Agency launched a coordinated research programme
(CRP) to search for inducible genes in crops that either do not
produce viable seeds or are propagated by seed but the progeny
are very different from the parent. The aim is to identify the
genes that enable each crop to tolerate one or other  inhibiting
condition drought tolerance in potatoes is an example isolate
these genes, clone or transfer them to that variety, or
accentuate their effect, so that the crop better meets the
challenge.  Another part of the programme is to induce mutations
by irradiation and thereby produce new and possibly more
productive varieties of crops.
<P>
The CRP on <I>in-vitro</I> <B>techniques for mutation induction
and selection of desired genotypes</B> involves national
agricultural research institutes of nine countries   Bangladesh,
China, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, India, Pakistan, Peru and
Syria with Ilga Winicov of the University of Nevada, Reno, USA,
as agreement holder.
<P>
Crops being studied are cassava (Kenya), garlic (China, Syria),
pineapple (Ghana), potato (Colombia, Egypt, India, Pakistan),
sugarcane (Bangladesh, Pakistan) and sweet potato (Peru). The
countries are seeking to find out how these plants can withstand
specific stress in a particular environment. Peru, for instance,
wants a sweet potato that can cope with high temperature and
drought. Bangladesh wants a sugarcane that can grow in
water-logged conditions, and one that does not flower because
flowering stops growth and sugar recovery suffers. 
<P>
Ilga Winicov has done pioneering work on alfalfa. By stressing
alfalfa with high doses of sodium in the growing medium she has
been able to select cell lines and regenerate plants (even seeds)
that are much more tolerant than the parental variety; and can
withstand 1% sodium chloride in the water. What's more, they
exclude the salt rather than survive salt uptake. In much earlier
experiments with sugarcane, in Hawaii and Cuba, scientists found
plants that tolerated salt but took it up, so when crystallising
sugar the salt was also crystallised. Winicov has also used
molecular techniques to identify the messenger RNA in alfalfa,
opening new avenues for that technique to be used.

</font>
</center>
<P>
The CRP is applying a combination of tissue culture and radiation
mutation techniques, to induce desired genes or produce new ones.
In the first, the planting medium is manipulated by adding salt
or chemicals that produce the undesired effect in the plant, such
as cell dessication which is what happens in drought, to simulate
the stress conditions in a field. In the second, mutations can be
induced in millions of plant cells or entire plants by a single
radiation dose. Both provide the huge cell populations needed, to
select the desired traits. In some cases, even selection can be
done at  the test tube culture stage. And once the required
genetic changes have been identified the selected plants can be
multiplied in tissue culture very quickly in the lab, for release
to farmers the ultimate target.  Some CRP participants already
have plants in field trials which were produced in the lab.

<P>
<OL>
<B> Missions and follow-up visits </B>
<P>
<LI>In the past twelve months, three full OSART missions have been carried out (in the second half of 1995).  Also, Agency staff participated in reviews of upgrading measures being taken on the basis of Agency guidance at the Kozloduy NPP (Bulgaria), the Rovenskaya and Khmelnitsky NPPs (Ukraine) and the Dukovany and Temelin NPPs (Czech Republic).  In addition, there were safety review follow-up visits to the Novovoronezh NPP (Ukraine), the Kozloduy NPP and the Bohunice NPP (Slovakia).
<P>
<B>Mission findings</B>
<P>
<LI>The three full OSART missions were to the Ignalina NPP (Lithuania), the Khmelnitsky NPP and the Beznau NPP (Switzerland).  It was found that at the Ignalina and Khmelnitsky NPPs excellence was judged in terms of meeting regulatory requirements, whereas the Beznau NPP staff aimed to exceed regulatory requirements (see in this connection "OSART programme highlights, 1993-1994, Operational safety practices in nuclear power plants", IAEA-TECDOC-874, April 1996, Part 1).
<P>
<LI>Other findings of these OSART missions may be summarized as follows:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	at all three NPPs, the staff were well qualified and keen to achieve the expectations of management with regard to safe plant operation, although those expectations needed - to differing degrees - to be expressed more clearly;
<P>
<DD>-	at the Ignalina and Khmelnitsky NPPs, there was, in addition, a significant need for the managers to establish more challenging safety expectations and give the staff better guidance for improving safety performance;
<P>
<DD>-	at the Beznau NPP, there was a need to strengthen parts of the management policies and procedures in order to help ensure continued safe operation.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>The Ignalina and Khmelnitsky NPPs were not receiving incomes that matched their production costs, so that the funding of repairs and long-term safety improvements was unpredictable - with consequent delays.  Also, staff motivation was being weakened by the late payment of salaries.  The cumulative effect of these and other problems could adversely affect safety at the two NPPs.
<P>
<LI>At the Beznau NPP it appeared that the threshold for the in-depth analysis of events should be lower and that management was failing to learn some lessons from experience; in particular, there was a reluctance to thoroughly assess human performance contributions to events.  In addition, there was a need for more careful examination of the performance of systems following reactor trips so as to ensure that they are operating properly.
<P>
<B>OSART follow-up visits</B>
<P>
<LI>OSART follow-up visits to the Cattenom and Flamanville NPPs (France), the Hunterston B NPP (United Kingdom) and the Hamaoka NPP (Japan) demonstrated the effectiveness of the OSART service; operational safety enhancements have occurred at all four NPPs.  By the time of the follow-up visits (on average some 16 months after the original OSART mission) 60% of the OSART-identified issues had been fully resolved, 39% were satisfactorily close to being resolved and only 1% (two issues) had apparently received too little attention.  The follow-up teams reported that there had been a willingness on the part of the NPP staff not only to look at the specific issues, but also to analyse the OSART findings in greater depth and to develop improvements going beyond those originally foreseen.
<P>
<B>Changes in the OSART process</B>
<P>
<LI>Over the past year and a half, significant changes have been made in the OSART process so as to enhance its value to Member States and NPP operators.  The training of OSART members has been strengthened, and review methods and the content of OSART reports have been modified so that OSART members can focus more clearly on identifying worthwhile improvement opportunities.  The accessibility of the OSART Missions Results (OSMIR) database has been increased through the provision of a user-friendly interface.
<P>
<B>Self-assessment</B>
<P>
<LI>Considerable interest has been shown by Member States in the self-assessment of operational safety performance, and the Secretariat has begun helping Member States to develop and implement self-assessment programmes.  It has begun considering what role, if any, self-assessments with subsequent peer reviews could play in the implementation of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, and utilities in Canada, France and the United Kingdom have expressed an interest in hosting international reviews of their peer review programmes.

<B> Recent developments </B>
<P>
<LI>As of the end of July 1996, there had been three ASSET missions (to the Russian Federation and Sweden) and six ASSET seminars (held in the Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine) since the 1995 session of the General Conference.  The purpose of the seminars was to prepare plant staff to perform self-assessments, and that of two of the three missions was to carry out peer reviews of the first two self-assessments to be performed - one at the Forsmark NPP in Sweden and the other at the Leningrad NPP in the Russian Federation.
<P>
<LI>Some of the mission findings are set out below:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	among the safety problems identified were deficiencies in control rod manoeuvring systems, problems in setting torques and limits for isolation valves, circuit-breaker failures caused by lubrication problems, and failures of fire isolation valves;
<P>
<DD>-	in order that there may be a larger population of events from which lessons can be learned by plant management, the event reporting criteria should be broadened and the event reporting thresholds lowered;
<P>
<DD>-	the most important safety culture problems are connected with learning from events such as recurrent operating personnel failures, failures in reactor emergency protection systems, and emergency core cooling and primary piping failures.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>In June, at the 1996 annual workshop on ASSET experience, it was recommended that the Secretariat continue to promote self-assessments by NPP personnel and provide further guidance on evaluating the significance of events and prioritizing the safety problems reflected in events.
<P>
<LI>Training in ASSET methodology was given in March 1996 at a regional course on operational safety assessment techniques held in Spain within the framework of the Agency's technical co-operation programme.

<LI>The Secretariat plans to include within the scope of the ASSET service assessments of NPP safety performance based not only on records of reportable operating events but also on safety system unavailability records and on equipment maintenance, testing, inspection, replacement and modification records.  It is developing guidance for such assessments.
<P>
<LI>A computerized database is being prepared as a source of information for Member States on the operational events at NPPs which have received ASSET missions, the safety problems identified and the response actions proposed.

<LI>ESRS reviews covering the siting and seismic aspects of nuclear installations and possible external events were performed during the past year.
<P>
<B>Siting aspects</B>
<P>
<LI>In Morocco, an ESRS team reviewed the qualification studies for the Sidi Boulbra NPP site carried out by the Moroccan Office National de l'Electricit and French consultants Sofratome.
<P>
<LI>In Indonesia, a study by the National Atomic Energy Agency (BATAN) and Japanese consultants NEWJEC for an NPP site on the Muria peninsula and the ESRS review of that study continued.  Although some key issues (relating to tectonics, volcanology and geotechnical engineering) require further work, it is expected that the study and the review will be completed this year.
<P>
<LI>In Thailand, the electrical utility company EGAT is in the process of starting an NPP site qualification study for which an ESRS team reviewed the terms of reference.
<P>
<LI>In the Czech Republic, an ESRS team reviewed site studies carried out by the utility _EZ and local consultants for a central interim spent fuel storage facility to be constructed at Skalka, about 60 km north-west of Brno.  The main focus of the review was on geological and hydrogeological issues.
<P>
<B>Seismic aspects</B>
<P>
<LI>In the Islamic Republic of Iran, where the Bushehr NPP project was recently reactivated with a view to the construction of two WWERs, an ESRS team reviewed the original seismic design basis parameter values and recommended that they be checked and, if necessary, modified along the lines proposed by Atomenergoproekt, Moscow.
<P>
<LI>In Hungary, an ESRS team reviewed studies carried out by consultants Ove Arup in connection with the upgrading of the Paks NPP.  The team agreed that there were no fault capability problems at the site and that the proposed new review level earthquake of 0.25g associated with a site-specific design response spectrum was sufficiently conservative.
<P>
<LI>ESRS teams which carried out several missions to Armenia agreed with the conclusion of the utility Armatomenergo that there were no fault capability problems in the vicinity of the Armenia NPP site.  The new review level earthquake of 0.35g associated with a site-specific response spectrum was found to be adequate.  It was recommended that a comprehensive programme for re-evaluation of the plant be established with two phases - the original design and the upgrades to 0.2g already carried out to be properly confirmed and documented during the first phase, before reopening of the plant, and the plant re-evaluation itself and upgrading to 0.35g to be carried out during the second phase, after reopening of the plant.<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>
<LI>In Slovenia, an ESRS team reviewed the interim results of a fault capability re-evaluation being carried out at the Krsko NPP and the work plans for future work in the areas of geology, seismology and geophysics.
<P>
<LI>A review of the seismic design of the Chashma NPP in Pakistan was carried out during two ESRS missions which involved meetings with the main Chinese contractor, SNERDI, and a brief walkdown of the reference facility, the Qinshan NPP.
<P>
<LI>Terms of reference documents were prepared for ESRS reviews of seismic capacity and seismic upgrading to be carried out at the Bohunice NPP in Slovakia and the Medzamor NPP in Armenia.
<P>
<B>External events</B>
<P>
<LI>An external event PSA for the Krko NPP, Slovenia, performed by Westinghouse and EQE International was reviewed by an ESRS team which made several recommendations, particularly relating to floods, winds and man-induced hazards.
<P>
<B>Workshop</B>
<P>
<LI>A workshop on seismic hazard analysis methodology, held in Taejon, Republic of Korea, was attended by participants from China, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Pakistan and Thailand.

<B>Recent developments</B>
<P>
<LI>Since the 1995 session of the General Conference there have been (as of end of July 1996) two IPERS missions, requested by the Czech Republic and Argentina.  By the end of July 1996, the Secretariat had organized 37 international peer reviews of 18 probabilistic safety assessments (PSAs).
<P>
<LI>The two latest international peer reviews were conducted in accordance with the revised guidelines in technical document IAEA-TECDOC-832, published in October 1995.
<P>
<LI>As previous reviews had shown human reliability assessment to be a difficult aspect of PSAs, a human reliability assessment specialist was included in the teams which conducted these reviews.
<P>
<B>Mission findings</B>
<P>
<LI>The IPERS team which visited the Czech Republic concluded that, at the NPP in question, specific features of the particular containment design could provide pathways for large and early releases of radioactive material during severe accidents and that such features should be taken into account in the PSA.
<P>
<LI>More generally, IPERS activities have highlighted numerous problems, including problems due to inadequate quality assurance during the conduct of PSAs.  The Secretariat has therefore initiated work on the preparation of guidelines for an effective PSA quality assurance programme.
<P>
<LI>IPERS mission findings are now being stored in a computerized database that permits queries to be made by PSA topic and by reactor type.

<P>
<LI>As can be seen from the table at the end of this Appendix, INSARR missions are increasingly taking place at the request of Member States rather than pursuant to project or supply agreements between Member States and the Agency.
<P>
<LI>The purpose of requested INSARR missions is usually to assist the regulatory authority in reviewing the safety of a research reactor or to assist an operating organization with the safety upgrading of a research reactor.
<P>
<B>Mission findings</B>
<P>
<LI>Most of the research reactors visited have been found to be in fairly good (often very good) condition and to be manned by experienced and knowledgeable staff.  However, at many older reactors at least some of the instrumentation and control equipment - including equipment for radiation protection monitoring - has been found to be in need of renewal.  Often, renewal projects had already been initiated by the operating organizations in question, and the INSARR team's task was essentially to assist the operating organization's staff in assessing the adequacy of the renewal projects.
<P>
<LI>On the other hand, INSARR missions have quite often revealed that reactor safety reports are not updated (documents relating to modifications not being integrated into them) and that procedures for reactor operation, reactor maintenance, periodic testing of the reactor, radiation protection and emergency situations are incomplete or have not been updated.  Also, in many cases it has been found that quality assurance programmes are not enforced or are lacking altogether and that record-keeping is poor.
<P>
<LI>As a rule, the findings are discussed extensively with the staff during the mission and then presented to the management at a formal "exit meeting".  Subsequently, a detailed report is prepared by the Secretariat and sent to the government of the visited Member State.
<P>
<B>Missions within the technical co-operation framework</B>
<P>
<LI>In addition to INSARR missions as described above, the Secretariat has organized INSARR-type missions to several Member States for the purpose of helping them to license and commission new research reactors.  Such missions are carried out within the framework of the Agency's technical co-operation programme, and there have been two this year - to Colombia and the Syrian Arab Republic.
<P>
<B>New safety documents</B>
<P>
<LI>Three new Safety Practices documents are being developed, on: (i) the provision of radiation protection services for research reactors; (ii) the training and qualification of operating personnel for research reactors; and (iii) safety instrumentation for research reactors.  It is expected that they will be ready for publication early next year.
<P>
<LI>Also, detailed guidance (to be published as an IAEA-TECDOC) on the conduct of research reactor safety reviews has been developed in the light of the experience gained during INSARR missions.  The guidance is intended for INSARR teams, but it could be very useful to regulatory authorities, operating organization managements and the like.

<OL>
<P>
<LI>During the past year ASCOT seminars have been conducted in Hungary (with 22 participants) and Mexico (with 70 participants).
<P>
<LI>Increasingly, ASCOT seminars are being attended not only by staff from nuclear power plant operating organizations but also by representatives of regulatory bodies, utility corporate headquarters and supporting organizations.  This trend is being encouraged by the Secretariat.
<P>
<LI>As it is felt that safety culture can be fully comprehended only in the context of the relevant national conditions, a presentation on national experience with strengthening safety culture has become an established feature of ASCOT seminars.
<P>
<LI>The indicators of safety culture now found in most operating organizations include:  awareness of safety culture issues; commitment to good safety performance and to continuous safety performance evaluation and improvement; commitment to good safety performance as an end in itself and not merely as a means of satisfying regulatory requirements; investigation of the fundamental causes of events or "near misses"; the examination of activities with potential safety impacts; a co-ordinated programme of regular safety audits; and efforts to learn from the safety performance of other organizations.

<B>Reporting to the IRS</B>
<P>
<LI>During the one-year period ending June 1996, the Agency's Secretariat received 110 IRS reports.
<P>
<B>Joint IAEA-NEA Advisory Committee</B>
<P>
<LI>In August 1995, the Agency and OECD/NEA formally approved the constitution of a Joint IAEA-NEA Advisory Committee with the task of helping the two organizations to make the best use of the IRS and to ensure that its high level of efficiency is maintained.  The Committee - comprising three members from OECD countries, two from non-OECD countries and one representative of each of the two organizations - will meet at least once a year.  The first meeting took place in Vienna in March 1996.  One of the conclusions reached by the Advisory Committee at that meeting was that the Secretariat should develop a network version of the Advanced Incident Reporting System (AIRS), which already contains over 2400 reports.
<P>
<LI>On the recommendation of the Joint IAEA-NEA Advisory Committee, work has started on the development of joint OECD/NEA-Agency guidelines regarding the operation of the IRS.  The existing separate OECD/NEA guidelines and Agency guidelines (the latter contained in Part II of Safety Series No. 93), and also suggestions which have been made by IRS participating countries, are serving as input into this work.
<P>
<B>Release of the AIRS database</B>
<P>
<LI>A test version of the AIRS database - containing full report texts with illustrations and annotations - was distributed (on CD-ROM) to the National Co-ordinators of the IRS participating countries in October 1995, and in November a group of consultants examined the test results.  In October 1995 and May 1996 training workshops were held for AIRS database users.  Improvements were made to the test version on the basis of feedback from the users, and the resulting version (Version 1.0) was released at the end of June 1996.
<P>
<B>Joint OECD/NEA-Agency meeting</B>
<P>
<LI>The 1996 joint OECD/NEA-Agency meeting on the exchange of information about recent events at NPPs was held (together with the 1996 meeting of IRS National Co-ordinators) in Paris from 22 to 26 April 1996.  There were 50 participants from 22 countries and three international organizations.
<P>
<LI>The national presentations indicated that problems with batteries, valves, fuel and control rods, pressure tubes and signal systems had been the main causes of recent events at NPPs, that foreign material intrusion and corrosion had also caused some events and that events occurring during shutdown were still a source of concern.
<P>
<B>Other recent developments</B>
<P>
<LI>Since the 1995 session of the General Conference, groups of consultants have carried out studies on the following topics:  "Operational experience feedback:  national topical/generic studies";  "The better reporting of causes (including human performance) and learning points for events reported to the IRS"; "Single human failures in nuclear power plants:  a human factors approach to event analysis"; and "IRS events connected with activities of vendors and contractors at NPPs".
<P>
<LI>In December 1995, the Agency published a report on IRS highlights during the period 1994-95.<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>  Also, the Secretariat has begun preparing a general leaflet about the IRS, its mode of operation and the benefits to be expected from it - for distribution to the public - and an IAEA-TECDOC on operational safety experience feedback through the use of reports on unusual events.
<P>
<B>Peer review</B>
<P>
<LI>At the request of Slovakia, a peer review of the national incident reporting system was carried out in July 1995, the objective being to provide the regulatory authority with an independent opinion regarding the operational experience feedback process.
<P>
<B>Outlook</B>
<P>
<LI>The Secretariat intends to collaborate more closely with OECD/NEA
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	in endeavouring to increase the reporting rate, so that all events of interest to the international community from the point of view of lessons to be learned are reported, and
<P>
<DD>-	in examining the quality of IRS reports with a view to increasing their usability in the evaluations and analyses performed by IRS national co-ordinators.

<P>
<LI>INES is now used by 59 countries for facilitating rapid communication between the nuclear community, the media and the public regarding the significance of nuclear events.
<P>
<B>Information on events</B>
<P>
<LI>During the period July 1995-June 1996, the Agency received and disseminated information relating to 73 events - 64 at NPPs and nine at other nuclear facilities.  Of those 73 events, 32 were stated to be "below scale" (i.e. safety-relevant but of no safety significance) and three to be "out of scale" (i.e. of no safety relevance).  Of the remaining 38 events, three were rated at INES level 3 and eight at level 2 (i.e. as "incidents"), and 27 at level 1 (i.e. as "anomalies").
<P>
<B>Recent developments</B>
<P>
<LI>Since the 1995 session of the General Conference, the following INES-related activities have taken place:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-	INES seminars have been held in Bulgaria, Kazakhstan and Romania;
<P>
<DD>-	an annual meeting of INES National Officers has been held (in October 1995), with the emphasis on national communication policies and practices;
<P>
<DD>-	progress has been made in developing an INES computerized rating procedure based on defence-in-depth criteria; and
<P>
<DD>-	work has started on preparing an information leaflet and video designed to give the media and the public a better understanding of INES.

<B>ABSTRACT</B>
<P>
Accidents in the nuclear energy and fuel reprocessing
industry have caused clinical effects in workers who were accidentally exposed
to high doses of radiation. Such high dose exposures acutely and severely
affect blood cell production, resistance against infections and
intestinal function and may result in severe damage to the skin. The complex disease
which originates from such exposures is known as acute radiation
sickness (ARS). 
The most common symptoms of ARS are initially nausea, vomiting
and diarrhoea and, later on, bleeding and generalized infections, often caused
by micro organisms that are normally not harmful. If untreated, ARS is
lethal, even following radiation doses that are not necessarily incompatible
with survival of the human organism and which are regularly used in
clinical medicine to treat some forms of cancer.
<P>
After a nuclear or radiological accident, radiation damage
is frequently complicated by other injury, such as thermal burns.
The Chernobyl accident resulted in an unprecedented total number of 237
individuals who were suspected of suffering from ARS. All patients had been
exposed either as personnel at the reactor or as liquidators (rescue workers) in
the first days after the accident. The diagnosis was confirmed in 134
cases. Of these, 41 had mild (Grade I) ARS, one additional patient is still
disputed; all survived. Fifty patients had Grade II ARS, of which one died.
Seven patients died out of 22 with Grade III ARS. Of the most severely affected
21 patients, who suffered from Grade IV ARS, all but one died
despite intensive treatment. Among the Grade IV ARS patients, gastrointestinal
damage and radiation skin burns were the most common complicating factors.
<P>
In the last ten years, nine of the ARS patients and five of
the non confirmed cases have died. Their deaths do not relate to the
original severity of ARS and are, in the majority of cases, probably not
directly attributable to the radiation exposure. To improve care for the
victims of such exposures, a number of issues need to be addressed, such as:
the reasons for failure of the treatment of bone marrow
transplantation made available to the most severely affected patients; immediate
diagnosis and alternative modes of treatment; the best strategy for the medical
management of the acutely exposed radiation accident victim in the future in
view of new developments; and the quality of life of the surviving patients.
<P>
It was realized almost immediately that from the medical
point of view the persons acutely exposed as a result of an accident on this
scale are difficult to manage, since specialized centres have the capacity
for only a few patients. The experience gained from these patients has
provided additional information about the mechanisms of acute radiation
injury. There are many uncertainties about the prospects of the survivors.
Medical care should be provided to these patients at a competent level for
many years to follow, preferably co-ordinated by a single highly qualified
centre, while research efforts should focus in particular on treatment regimens
in the acute phase which anticipate the health complications that will
necessarily follow.

<B>ABSTRACT</B>
<P>
Four years after the Chernobyl accident on 26 April 1986, an increased incidence of thyroid carcinoma (cancer) was noticed in children
in Belarus and the Ukraine. The increase has continued, with well over 500 cases reported from the areas around Chernobyl. Background Paper 2
considers the size of the increase, with account taken of ascertainment, of the evidence that the increase is related to radiation exposure due to the
Chernobyl accident, of the isotope or isotopes responsible, and of the likely future effects.
<P>
External radiation is known to cause thyroid cancer, but radioactive  iodine has been used for many years in the treatment of
thyrotoxicosis without any increase in thyroid carcinoma. The majority of cases of thyroid 
carcinoma following exposure to X rays were papillary in type, the latent  period was about 5-10 years, sensitivity decreased with
increasing age at exposure, and the increase in the risk of induction of thyroid cancer persisted for decades.
<P>
Over 400 cases of thyroid cancer have occurred in children under the age of 15 in Belarus between 1990 and 1995 inclusive. The
increase is greatest in the Gomel oblast, which had relatively high deposition densities. The rate in Gomel is about 200 times that seen in
England and Wales, for example, for this normally rare tumour in children. About 150 cases have occurred in the `contaminated' northern oblasts of the
Ukraine: an incidence about 20 times higher than in England and Wales, and 7 times higher than in the southern Ukraine. The diagnoses of thyroid
cancer have been confirmed in over 90% of the cases available for study (over half of all cases are available); increased ascertainment of cases from
screening has been excluded as a major contributory factor. Virtually all cases were papillary in type. The situation in the Russian Federation is
less clear. In the oblasts most affected by radiation, there appears to have been an increase in childhood thyroid carcinoma, but probably to a lesser
extent than in Belarus or in the Ukraine.
<P>
There is strong evidence that the increased incidence of childhood thyroid cancer is due to radiation exposure as a result of the
Chernobyl accident, based on the geographical and temporal distribution of the cases. In both Belarus and the Ukraine they are commonest in the oblasts
close to Chernobyl that had high levels of contamination. The incidence in children born more than 6 months after the accident drops dramatically to
the low levels expected in unexposed populations.
<P>
The evidence that the increase is due to radioactive isotopes of iodine is at present circumstantial. It is based on the fact that the
increase in cancer in the exposed population is limited to thyroid tumours. The relatively high thyroid doses are due to the thyroid's ability to
concentrate radioiodine, which was deposited at high levels in areas close  to the Chernobyl plant. Other contributory factors cannot be
excluded, but appear unlikely to have played a major role. The likelihood of developing thyroid carcinoma is much greater in those who were very young at
exposure, and drops rapidly with age. This is consistent with the known high uptake of  radioiodine in young children and the higher sensitivity of young
children to the carcinogenic effect of X radiation to the thyroid.
<SUP>131</SUP>I was the major cause of radiation exposure of the thyroid. Short lived isotopes of iodine  could have played a role in the immediate vicinity of the plant.
A reported  increase in incidence of hypothyroidism and of thyroid nodules in Gomel  oblast is also consistent with radioiodine exposure.
<P>
Future effects are difficult to predict, because of a lack of  experience of exposure at this level of a large population. The cohort made 
up of those who were very young at the time of the accident and were exposed at high levels is likely to carry an increased risk of developing
thyroid cancer for many years. The level of risk could be high; further studies are needed to establish a dose-response relationship and to improve
the prediction of likely future incidence. Thyroid cancer, if properly treated, does not carry a high mortality and the observations suggest that
targeted screening of those exposed at high levels at a young age may be effective.

<B>ABSTRACT</B>
<P>

Apart from the dramatic increase in thyroid cancer in those
exposed as children (see <A HREF="paper2.html">Background Paper
2</A>), there is no
evidence to date of a major public health impact as a result of
radiation exposure due to the Chernobyl accident in the three
most affected countries (Belarus, Russia and Ukraine). Although
some increases in the frequency of cancer in exposed populations
have been reported, these results are difficult to interpret,
mainly because of differences in the intensity and method of
follow-up between exposed populations and the general population
with which they are compared.
<P>
If the experience of the survivors of the atomic bombing of Japan
and of other exposed populations is applicable, the major
radiological impact of the accident will be cases of cancer. The
total lifetime numbers of excess cancers will be greatest among
the liquidators (emergency and recovery workers) and among the
residents of contaminated territories, of the order of 2,000 to
2,500 among each group (the size of the exposed populations is
200,000 liquidators and 3,700,000 residents of contaminated
areas). These increases would be difficult to detect
epidemiologically against an expected background number of 41,500
and 433,000 cases of cancer respectively among the two groups.
 <P>
However, the exposures for populations due to the Chernobyl
accident are different (in type and pattern) from those of the
survivors of the atomic bombing of Japan (and doses received
early after the accident are not well known). Predictions derived
from studies of these populations are therefore uncertain.
Indeed, although an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer
in persons exposed as children as a result of the Chernobyl
accident was envisaged, the extent of the increase was not
foreseeable. In addition, only ten years have passed since the
accident. It is essential, therefore, that monitoring of the
health of the population be continued in order to assess the
public health impact of the accident, even if any increase in the
incidence of cancers as a result of radiation exposure due to the
Chernobyl accident, except for leukemia among liquidators and
thyroid cancer, is expected to be difficult to detect.
Studies of selected populations and diseases are also needed in
order to study observed or predicted effects; careful studies may
in particular provide important information on the effect of
exposure rate and exposure type in the low to medium dose range
and on factors which may modify radiation effects. As such, they
may have important consequences for the radiation protection of
patients and the general population in the event of any future
accidental exposure.

<B>ABSTRACT</B>
<P>The widespread public anxiety and pessimism about the
Chernobyl accident appears to be out of all proportion to the
radiation induced health effects. The concept of stress is
invoked to explain the widespread damage to general health and
well-being.
<P>Stress can be defined as the process by which adverse mental
experiences have negative effects on bodily functions. The
mechanism is physiological, mediated through the autonomic
nervous system and the endocrinological system.
<P>The International Chernobyl Project study was conducted by the
International Advisory Committee in 1990 and published by the
IAEA in 1991. The study found significant differences between
contaminated and clean areas for symptoms attributable to
stress; 45% (30% in clean areas) believed that they had an
illness due to radiation exposure. The level of general health
was found to be low and almost all ailments were attributed by
the population to radiation. These effects (confirmed by other
studies) were compounded by poor public understanding of
radiation; initial secrecy; subsequent lack of effective
communication; and the collapse of the centralized political and
economic systems. Distrust of authorities is widespread. One
important study using a regression method has shown that
economic situation and attitude to the future are better
predictors of stress symptoms than contamination level.
<P>A large scale survey has compared stress effects in
restricted, non-restricted (but geographically close),
resettlement and control areas. Positive differences were found
between the distant control sites (surveyed for comparative
purposes) and other sites, but differences between restricted
and non-restricted were small. Resettlement areas were no
better and, on some criteria, worse. Many respondents believed
that they had received a dangerous dose of radiation and that
their personal health had been damaged.
<P>Other studies question the effectiveness of resettlement as a
countermeasure. Neither women nor the elderly show any net
benefit and only in Russia is there an overall reduction in
stress.
<P>An important study has measured locus of control, i.e. the
belief that one can control ones own destiny, versus fatalism.
This was used to predict the response to food controls, measured
directly by dose uptake. As expected, fatalism is associated
with higher stress levels and lower compliance with food
controls.
<P>Other research has shown that social support is crucial to
recovery from stress and UNESCO has set up community centres to
provide trustworthy information, individual and group therapy,
and a variety of recreational/cultural activities. A range of
other initiatives with similar aims are being developed.
<P>The allocation of the prototypical public reaction to a
correct diagnostic category is an obvious first step in planning
future countermeasures. False labelling such as vegetative
dystonia and radiophobia is counterproductive. The same
applies to the well established category of Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder, although this fits those exposed to the initial event.
The alternative suggested is Chronic Environmental Stress
Disorder.
<P>The original stressor cannot be removed, but it is possible to
change the way in which it is perceived and to enhance peoples
feelings of control over it. This means that beliefs and
attitudes have to be changed. The problem is more one of
communication than of medication.

<B>ABSTRACT</B>
<P>
In the ten years since the Chernobyl accident, an enormous amount
of work has been done to assess the consequences to the natural
and human environment. Although it is very difficult to summarize
such a large and varied field, some general conclusions can be
drawn. This Background Paper includes the main findings
concerning the direct impacts of radiation on the flora and
fauna; the general advances of knowledge in the cycling of
radionuclides in natural, semi-natural and agricultural
environments; some evaluation of countermeasures that were used;
and a summary of the human radiation doses resulting from the
environmental contamination. Although open questions still
remain, it can be concluded that: (1) At high radiation levels,
the natural environment has shown short term impacts but any
existence of significant long term impacts remains to be seen;
(2) Effective countermeasures can be taken to reduce the
transfer of contamination from the environment to humans but
these are highly site specific and must be evaluated in terms of
practicality as well as population dose reduction; and (3) The
majority of the doses have already been received by the human
population. If agricultural countermeasures are appropriately
taken, the main source of future doses will be due
to the gathering of food and recreational activities in natural
and semi-natural ecosystems.

<H2>Summary and Conclusions of the International Forum One Decade
After Chernobyl: Nuclear Safety Aspects</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The events which led to the accident in Unit 4 of the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant on 26 April 1986 have been
investigated by many teams of scientists over the past ten years.
Although there are still some gaps in knowledge relating to
details of some phenomena involved in the accident, the knowledge
acquired in the meantime is sufficient to identify the causes and
to take effective measures to prevent a repetition of such an
event. Between 1987 and 1991, a first stage of safety upgrading
was performed for all RBMK units addressing the most serious
problems in this area. There remain issues beyond the scope of
the first stage of upgrading which require further attention.
These needs largely depend on the different stages of RBMK
development. After the backfits immediately related to the causes
of the Chernobyl accident, the second and third generation RBMKs
basically meet most of the defence in depth objectives applied to
modern nuclear power plants. Certainly, deficiencies remain, e.g.
with regard to the limitations of partial confinement and the
control and protection system. The practicability of backfitting
of first generation RBMKs raises further questions in addition to
the issues relevant for the second and third plant generation.
There have been significant doubts in Western countries about the
feasibility and the cost effectiveness of backfits. However, from
today's perspective it must be recognized that the existing
upgrading programmes address most of the safety concerns.
<P>
International co-operation can essentially contribute to the
improvement of RBMK safety as follows:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-     A more extensive technical co-operation on plant
specific evaluation of defence in depth, e.g. within recurrent
safety assessments, precursor analyses and evaluation of
operating experience, could significantly increase openness and
concentrate the attention of all organizations relevant for
safety on the most significant problems. Such co-operation would
strengthen the dynamic safety approach not only in eastern Europe
but also in Western countries. 
<P>
<DD>-     International co-operation could also help to ensure
the allocation of financial resources for improving quality,
documentation, safety design and the conduct of operation.
Particular possibilities are seen in a more systematic use of
synergisms between plant availability and safety and of new modes
of industrial co-operation.
</DL>
<P>
     Most of the considerations on RBMK safety also hold
for the Chernobyl plant. Nevertheless, the situation at Chernobyl
is a particular one as there exists a range of site specific
problems. These problems concern both the safety of the remaining
units and the accident consequences. For the consequences of the
accident, concerns focus on the sarcophagus built around the
destroyed reactor, on the radioactive material contained inside
the sarcophagus and on the radioactive material buried on the
site.

<B>ABSTRACT</B>
<P>
This paper summarizes the consequences of the Chernobyl
accident in order to provide a factual basis for future policy decisions. There are two main
issues: What actions can be taken to limit the health effects of the accident? And what risk is still
posed by the remains of the reactor in the sarcophagus?
<P>
Assessing the health effects of radiation exposure due to the accident is very difficult. The
doses received as a result of the accident are not well known and the complex relation between
dose received and cancer induction is still not well understood. As a result, projections of future
numbers of extra cancer cases depend on a number of assumptions and are at best crude estimates.
<P>
Epidemiological investigations to detect health effects in populations, as opposed to effects
in individuals, are complex and extremely difficult to conduct. It is difficult to find appropriate
control groups for comparative purposes and to distinguish the influence of the studies themselves
on the results. In addition, there has been a general deterioration in public health in the countries
of the former Soviet Union since 1987. This general trend towards poorer health has been
misinterpreted and misrepresented as being due to the Chernobyl accident. 
<P>
It has been asserted that to up to tens of thousands of people "have already died", implying
that they were victims of the Chernobyl accident. However, the total death rate in 1990-1992
among 'liquidators' (emergency and recovery workers) did not exceed that for the corresponding
age group in the Russian Federation as a whole. 
<P>
The only health effects to date that are attributable to radiation exposure due to the accident
are an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancers in children, and various health effects among
the initial responders; psychological effects are unrelated to radiation but are attributable to the
accident and the countermeasures taken and the consequent disruption and distress. 
<P>
The increase in the incidence of childhood thyroid cancer has been dramatic and, if it persists
in the age group affected as they grow older over the coming decades, may result in up to several
thousands excess thyroid cancers. The number of fatalities would be much lower than this, since
treatment should be 90-95% successful if the thyroid cancer is diagnosed early. The affected group
should therefore continue to be closely monitored throughout their lives. 
<P>
There have been local reports, not yet been confirmed by any international group, of small
increases in the general rates of other cancers and other health problems in the affected countries.
However, any such increases may result from factors unrelated to radiation exposure due to the
accident. On the basis of the estimated doses resulting from the accident, any attributable increase
in all cancers would not be statistically discernible from normally occurring 'background' cancers. 
<P>
Increases in leukaemia and thyroid cancers among the most highly exposed groups
(liquidators and evacuees) may in principle be detectable in the future. However, before these
could be attributed to radiation exposure due to the accident they would have to be carefully
distinguished from upwards trends in cancer incidence that began before the accident.
<P>
The psychological effects of the accident and of the continuing countermeasures taken are
clearly important and, while not directly due to radiation exposure, are likely to be among the most
important legacies of the accident. The psychological effects are difficult to distinguish and to
quantify, however.
<P>
What can be done now to limit the health impact of the accident in the future? For much of
the area contaminated at the time of the accident, radiation dose rates are presently within the
range of doses due to the natural background levels of radiation found in Europe. As a result, it
is unlikely that <I>future exposure to radiation</I> as a result of living in these areas will lead
to any detectable increase in the incidence of cancers. Any measures intended to reduce the future
dose further should therefore be carefully evaluated for their effectiveness and their expected
benefits should be weighed against their probable economic and psychological costs.
<P>
There are two groups of people who would clearly benefit from careful medical monitoring
in the future: those children with an elevated probability of incurring thyroid cancer, and the most
highly exposed among the liquidators.
<P>
As for whether the destroyed reactor still poses a threat: any high radiation dose rates as a
result of a potential collapse of the sarcophagus now enclosing the reactor's remains would be
confined to the plant's immediate vicinity. However, more importantly, a collapse of the
sarcophagus could have implications for nuclear safety at the operating Unit 3. In addition, the
sarcophagus and material dumped in its vicinity form presently an unconfined source of a large
amount of radioactive material which could eventually represent a contamination hazard for the
local groundwater. These issues require further study.
<P>
The question in conclusion is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
What policies and measures can now be developed by the most affected countries for the
public and for the Chernobyl plant to take into account both the present radiological risk
and the economic, social and psychological impacts of the accident and to yield the most
benefit?

  Nuclear power beyond Chernobyl:
  <BR>
  A changing international perspective</H2>
  <P>
  <I>Nuclear power's development has slowed over the past 10
years but steady growth is projected
  well into the next century</I>
  <P>
  <B><A HREF="#author">by Poong Eil Juhn and J&uuml;rgen
Kupitz</A></B>
  <P>
  <HR>
  <P>
  Statistics show that nuclear power has become an important
energy source in many countries since its
  introduction four decades ago. In the 1960s, the industry was
convinced that nuclear power represented
  the solution to cheap and reliable energy supply, and
programmes were eagerly pursued worldwide. As
  a result, the construction of nuclear power plants expanded
rapidly through the 1970s. According to
  data in the IAEA's Power Reactor Information System (PRIS), by
1980 nuclear power production had
  increased to 692.1 terawatt-hours (TWh), contributing 8.4% of
total electricity generation. <I>(See
  figures, next page.)</I> This represented an almost ninefold
increase since 1970, and an average
  annual growth of 24% over the decade.
  <P>
  Since the 1980s, the expansion rate has dropped markedly even
though significant new nuclear
  electricity capacity is still added each year. In the period
1980-85, nuclear electricity generation
  increased to 1402 TWh, corresponding to an average annual
growth of 15.2% in generation; in the next
  half decade, during 1985-90, it increased to 1913 TWh, yielding
an annual growth of 6.4%. In the
  period 1990-94, it increased to 2130 TWh, corresponding to a
growth of about 2.8% per annum. The
  five largest producers in 1994 were the United States (639.4
TWh), France (341.8 TWh), Japan (258.3
  TWh), Germany (143.0 TWh), and Canada (101.7 TWh). 
  <P>
  Worldwide, the nuclear option today accounts for about 17% of
the total electricity produced. In
  altogether 14 countries (as well as in Taiwan, China),
one-quarter or more of the electricity is
  generated by nuclear power plants. Nuclear power accounts for
some 40% or more in eight countries:
  Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia,
Sweden, and Switzerland. <I>(See the
  International Data File section, page 53.)</I>
  <P>
  By the end of 1995, a total of 437 units with a generating
capacity of over 343 gigawatts-electric
  (GWe) were in operation in the world, and 39 units with a
generating capacity of over 32 GWe were
  under construction. The total accumulated operating experience
of the operating plants amounts to more
  than 6637 reactor years, or an average operating period per
plant of about 15 years. Substantial
  operating experience has also been gained by plants that have
now been shut down, and factoring in
  these plants yields a total of more than 7700 reactor years. In
other words, by now, nuclear energy has
  acquired a strong position in the electricity generation sector
as a mature technology.
  <P>
  <H3>Impact of the Chernobyl accident</H3>
  <P>
  Recent development trends could give the impression that
nuclear power's slower rate of growth after
  the 1985-90 period is mostly due to the Chernobyl accident,
which occurred in April 1986. Actually,
  other factors were at work as well, and overall Chernobyl's
impact varied around the world. 
  <P>
  One factor has been the rate of electricity growth, which in
many countries declined during the past
  decade and influenced decisions about capacity additions
throughout the electricity sector. Since the
  construction of a nuclear plant takes 5 to 8 years to complete,
with a lead time (after contract) of 1 to 2
  years, any observable indication of Chernobyl's direct impact
over the past decade would be hard to
  discern.
  <P>
  Still, the accident did have immediate consequences in some
countries. In countries operating
  Chernobyl-type reactors, the operation of the plants was
carefully checked and a number of restrictions
  were imposed. Public opposition also caused other types of
plants outside these countries to shut down
  for a period of time. In Italy, the Caorso plant was taken out
of service indefinitely and construction of
  the Montalto di Castro plants was stopped following a
referendum in the wake of the accident, and in
  both Finland and the Netherlands plans for new nuclear power
plant projects were mothballed.
  <P>
  Generally in Europe, the Chernobyl accident is one of the
reasons that increases in nuclear deployment
  have been brought more or less to a complete halt; politicians
do not dare to promote nuclear power as
  a safe and clean energy source, and utilities are afraid of the
financial risks with respect to the
  economic consequences of a major nuclear accident. Besides, the
economies of the European countries
  have been growing at a very slow rate, if growing at all, and
the rate of growth in overall energy
  demand has been very small. On the other hand, recent studies
have shown that the picture is likely to
  change. Electricity consumption continues to rise with economic
growth, even when total energy
  consumption is decreasing. In a few years time more generating
capacity will be needed in many
  countries, and chances are that some of this additional
capacity will be nuclear power plants.
  <P>
  In regions of Asia, the situation is different; the rate of
growth in energy demand is very high and
  nuclear is seen as an attractive option. Many countries in
these regions have ambitious programmes for
  deployment of nuclear power in the next decades, and vendors
worldwide are anticipating a
  revitalization of the nuclear market.
  <P>
  <H3>Advanced nuclear power plant designs</H3>
  <P>
  In a number of countries, great emphasis is being placed on the
development of advanced nuclear
  power plant designs. These new generations of nuclear power
plants have been, or are being,
  developed by building upon experience and applying lessons
learned from existing plants. Hence, the
  new, advanced designs are anticipated to become even more safe,
economic, and reliable than their
  predecessors.
  <P>
  The advanced designs generally incorporate improvements of the
safety concepts, including, among
  others, features that will allow operators more time to perform
safety actions, and that will provide
  even more protection against any possible releases of
radioactivity to the environment.  Great attention
  is also paid to making new plants simpler to operate, inspect,
maintain, and repair, thus increasing their
  overall reliability and economy.
  <P>
  Advanced designs comprise two sub-categories: evolutionary and
developmental designs.  The first
  encompasses direct descendants from predecessors (existing
plant designs) that feature improvements
  and modifications based on feedback of experience and adoption
of new technological achievements.
  They also take into account possible introduction of some new
features, e.g., by incorporating passive
  safety functions. Evolutionary designs are characterized by
requiring, at the most, engineering and
  confirmatory testing prior to commercial deployment.
Developmental designs consist of those that
  deviate more significantly from existing designs, and that
consequently need substantially more testing
  and verification, probably including also construction of a
demonstration plant and/or prototype plant
  before large-scale commercial deployment. 
  <P>
  Advanced designs under development comprise three basic types:
water-cooled reactors, utilizing water
  as coolant and moderator; fast reactors, using liquid metal,
e.g. sodium, as coolant; and gas-cooled
  reactors, using gas, e.g. helium, as coolant and graphite as
moderator.
  <P>
  Most -  about 75% -  of the nuclear power reactors in operation
are water-cooled reactors, and most
  of the advanced designs are, too. They are of two basic types:
light-water reactors (LWRs) with
  ordinary water as moderator, and heavy-water reactors (HWRs).
The LWRs are in turn subdivided into
  boiling and pressurized water reactors (BWRs and PWRs). 
  <P>
  Some examples of large evolutionary advanced LWRs are: the ABWR
of General Electric, United
  States; the APWR of Westinghouse, United States and Mitsubishi,
Japan; the BWR-90 of ABB Atom,
  Sweden; the EPR of Nuclear Power International (NPI), a joint
company of Framatome in France and
  Siemens in Germany; the SWR (or BWR) 1000 of Siemens; the
System 80+ of ABB Combustion
  Engineering, United States; the WWER-1000 (V-392) of
Atomenergoproject and Gidropress, Russia;
  and the KNGR of KEPCO and KAERI, the Republic of Korea. Among
the medium-size ALWRs, five
  typical designs are the AP-600 of Westinghouse, United States;
the AC-600 of China National Nuclear
  Corporation, China; the MS-600 of Mitsubishi, Japan; the SBWR
of General Electric, United States;
  and the WWER-640 (V-407) of Atomenergoproject and Gidropress,
Russia.  Many of the large- and
  medium-size designs are already available for commercial
deployment, or will be within a number of
  years.
  <P>
  The situation for developmental designs - such as ISIS of
Ansaldo, Italy; PIUS of ABB Atom,
  Sweden; SPWR of JAERI and IHI, Japan; and VPBER-600 of OKBM,
Russia - is more uncertain.
  This is due to the need for experimental verifications and
associated financing burdens.
  <P>
  Typical examples of advanced HWRs under development are the
advanced Canadian designs  - Candu-
  3 (of about 450 MWe), the Candu-6 (currently of about 680 MWe),
and the Candu designs (of 900-
  1100 MWe) of AECL, Canada -  and the improved Indian PHWR
design
(of about 500 MWe).
  <P>
  Liquid metal-cooled fast reactors (LMFRs), or breeders, have
been under development for many years
  in a number of countries. The design, construction, and
operation of several plants, such as the BN-600
  in Russia, the 1200-MWe Superphenix in France, and the 280-MWe
Monju in Japan, has provided
  extensive experience of more than 200 reactor years for further
improvements. The fast reactors use
   fast  neutrons for sustaining the fission process, and they
actually produce fuel as well as consume it;
  plutonium breeding allows fast reactors to extract sixty times
as much energy from uranium as thermal
  reactors do. Their capability of producing fissile material may
become indispensable in the longer term
  if the deployment of nuclear power is increased substantially
in the decades to come. Fast reactors may
  also contribute to burning of plutonium and to reduction of the
required isolation time for high-level
  radioactive waste by burning of long-lived transuranic
radioisotopes.
  <P>
  The further development of fast reactors focuses on improving
plant safety and economy, and on
  improvements of fuel burnup and fuel recycling technology to
reduce the amounts of radioactive waste.
  Examples of development concepts are the BN-800M in Russia, the
DFBR in Japan, the PFBR in
  India, the advanced European EFR, and the LMR developed by
General Electric in the United States.
<P>
Gas-cooled reactors have been in operation for many years. In
the United Kingdom, nuclear electricity
  is mostly generated in CO<SUB>2</SUB>-cooled Magnox and
Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactors (AGRs).
  Other countries also have pursued development of
high-temperature reactors (HTGRs) with helium as
  coolant, and graphite as moderator. Prototype or demonstration
plants have been built, without
  complete success, however. The inert helium gas and a special
fuel design enable these plants to
  operate at temperatures considerably above those in
water-cooled reactors; hence, they can supply
  steam for conventional steam turbine generators at much higher
temperature (and pressure), or high-
  temperature process heat for special applications. 
  <P>
  Further HTGR development concentrates on improved plant
performance and life extension studies. In
  particular, much effort is devoted to the direct gas-turbine
cycle which may yield very high thermal
  efficiency and low energy cost. A demonstration plant for
testing of high temperature process heat
  applications is under construction in Japan, and construction
of a test reactor has begun in China.
  <P>
  <H3>Prospects for nuclear power</H3>
  <P>
  Nuclear power alone will not ensure secure and sustainable
electricity supply worldwide, nor will it be
  the only means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which
continue to be a major environmental
  concern. But it has a key role to play. Studies of greenhouse
gas emissions from different energy
  chains for electricity generation indicate that nuclear power
is one of the cleaner options. <I>(See
  graphs.)</I>
  <P>
  A prerequisite for realizing the necessary revival of the
nuclear option is that the technical and
  economic performance of nuclear power plants must improve. At
the same time, plant safety must be
  further enhanced and the issues of waste management and
disposal must be more satisfactorily
  addressed.
  <P>
  At the present time, nuclear power is among the cheapest
sources of electricity generation in many
  countries. Its competitive margin has been reduced, however, by
low fossil fuel prices and increases in
  nuclear power plant capital costs, which are very much due to
long construction and licensing lead
  times. Rising market prices of fossil fuels, in particular gas,
and increased capital and operating costs
  of fossil fired units due to the required addition of abatement
systems for environmental reasons may
  reverse this trend in the coming decade. The economic advantage
of nuclear power can further be
  increased by the efforts of reactor designers to reduce capital
costs by streamlining the reactor
  concepts, reducing the amount of material required, and
shortening the construction times. Substantial
  progress has been achieved in this regard and additional gains
are expected through the deployment of
  advanced reactors.
  <P>
  Financing nuclear power plants will remain a key issue,
especially in developing countries. Technology
  adaptation, the development of small- and medium-size reactors,
and the implementation of new
  financing approaches may alleviate funding constraints and
facilitate a broader deployment of nuclear
  power.
  <P>
  <H3>Nuclear power projections beyond 2000</H3>
  <P>
  Projecting nuclear power development is a somewhat difficult
exercise. A number of factors can
  influence policies and decision-making, and the implementation
of programmes cannot be assessed with
  certainty. 
  <P>
  Up to the year 2000, the installed nuclear capacity worldwide
will grow to between 367 GWe and 375
  GWe, compared to 340 GWe in 1994, according to IAEA estimates.
Since all the units to be
  commissioned by the turn of the century are already under
construction, the range of uncertainty
  reflects potential delays in construction and licensing. New
nuclear units will be connected to the grid
  mainly in Asia, while in Western Europe and North America the
installed nuclear capacity will remain
  practically unchanged. In Eastern Europe, although some of the
units under construction will be
  completed, the economic transition will delay significantly the
implementation of nuclear programmes
  in most countries.
  <P>
  After the turn of the century, the range of uncertainty
regarding nuclear power development is wider,
  owing to a number of technical, economic, environmental, and
policy factors.  The low and high
  projections for nuclear generating capacity developed by the
IAEA up to 2015 are based upon a review
  of nuclear power projects and programmes in Member States. They
reflect contrasting but not extreme
  underlying assumptions on the different driving factors that
have an impact on nuclear power
  deployment.  These factors and the ways they might evolve vary
from country to country.
  Consequently, the IAEA projections do not reflect the whole
range of possible futures from the lowest
  to the highest feasible, but provide a plausible range of
nuclear capacity growth by region and
  worldwide.
  <P>
  In the low case, the current barriers to nuclear power
deployment are assumed to prevail in most
  countries during the coming two decades.  Economic and
electricity demand growth rates remain low in
  industrialized countries. Public opposition to nuclear power
continues, and environmental concerns,
  such as the risk of global climate change, do not become strong
driving factors in energy policies to
  switch from fossil to nuclear energy. Institutional and
financing issues prevent the implementation of
  previously planned nuclear programmes, in particular in
countries in transition and in developing
  countries, and there is no drastic enhancement regarding
nuclear technology adaptation and transfer,
  nor financial support to developing countries for the
implementation of nuclear power projects.
  <P>
  Under these rather pessimistic assumptions, most of the nuclear
units under construction would be
  completed but new nuclear units would be ordered only in the
countries where nuclear power is a major
  component of electricity generation mixes, such as France,
Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Owing to
  the large number of units that would be shut down at the end of
their scheduled operating lifetime, the
  total nuclear capacity in the world would start to decrease
after 2010 and would be similar in 2015 to
  that in 2000, i.e., at some 370 GWe. The share of nuclear power
in world electricity supply would
  decrease from about 17% at present to some 13% in 2015.
  <P>
  The high case reflects a moderate revival of nuclear power
deployment, that might result in particular
  from a more comprehensive comparative assessment of the
different options for electricity generation,
  integrating economic, social, health, and environmental
aspects. This case assumes that some policy
  measures would be taken to facilitate the implementation of
these programmes, such as strengthening of
  international co-operation, enhanced technology adaptation and
transfer, and establishment of innovative
  funding mechanisms. Based on these assumptions, the total
installed nuclear capacity world-wide would
  reach some 515 GWe in 2015 and the share of nuclear power in
total electricity generation would be
  some 15%.
  <P>
  In both the low and high cases, the production capabilities of
the world nuclear industry would exceed
  the demand for new reactors. A higher rate of nuclear power
development would be technically feasible
  and economically viable in a number of countries. However, a
substantive revival of nuclear power
  programmes would require policy measures, including a removal
of the <I>de facto</I> moratoria
  in several countries and the introduction of mechanisms for
providing funding support to nuclear
  projects in developing countries, which seem unlikely to be
implemented in the short term.
  <P>
  <H3>Other applications of nuclear energy</H3>
  <P>
  Today, only a few nuclear plants are being used for
non-electric applications (with a total capacity of
  only 5 GWth to supply hot water and steam). The potential
market for applications of nuclear energy in
  the non-electric energy sector may be quite large, however.
About 30% of the world's primary energy
  consumption is used for electricity generation, about 15% is
used for transportation, and the remaining
  55% is converted into hot water, steam, and heat. Non-electric
applications include desalination, hot
  water for district heating, and heat energy for petroleum
refining, for the petrochemical industry, and
  for the conversion of hard coal or lignite.
  <P>
  For non-electric applications, the specific temperature
requirements vary greatly. Hot water for district
  heating and heat for seawater desalination require temperatures
in the 80<SUP>o</SUP> to
  200<SUP>o</SUP>C range, whereas temperatures in the
250<SUP>o</SUP> to 550<SUP>>o</SUP>C
  range are required for petroleum refining processes. The use of
heat for enhancing heavy oil recovery
  can be applied by the method of hot water or steam injection.
The temperature and pressure conditions
  required for heavy oil recovery are highly dependent on the
geological conditions of the oil field; the
  temperature requirements range up to 550<SUP>o</SUP>C and
above. Oil shale and oil sand processing
  requires temperatures ranging from 300<SUP>o</SUP> to
600<SUP>o</SUP>C, and processes used in the
  petrochemical industry require higher temperatures, in the
range of 600<SUP>o</SUP> to
  880<SUP>o</SUP>C. Still higher temperatures (up to
950<SUP>o</SUP>C) are needed for refining
  hard coal or lignite (for example, to produce methanol for
transportation fuel), and temperatures of
  900<SUP>o</SUP> to 1000<SUP>o</SUP>C are necessary for the
production of hydrogen by water
  splitting.
  <P>
  Water-cooled reactors can provide heat up to about 300C, and
liquid-metal-cooled fast reactors produce
  heat up to about 540<SUP>o</SUP>C. The gas-cooled reactors can
provide even higher
  temperatures, about 650<SUP>o</SUP>C for advanced gas-cooled,
graphite-moderated reactors
  (AGRs), and up to 950<SUP>o</SUP> to 1000<SUP>o</SUP>C for
high-temperature gas-
  cooled reactors (HTGRs).
  <P>
  There is considerable incentive to utilize the capability of
nuclear plants to provide co-generation of
  electricity, steam, and heat for residential and industrial
purposes. Experience in co-generation with
  water-cooled reactors has been gained in the Russian
Federation, China, Canada, the Czech Republic,
  Slovakia, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary and Bulgaria. One of
the largest uses of nuclear process
  steam is at the Bruce Nuclear Power Development Facility in
Ontario, Canada, where the Candu
  PHWRs are capable of producing 6000 MWe of electricity as well
as process steam and heat for use by
  Ontario Hydro and an adjacent industrial energy park.
  <P>
  An important milestone in the development of high-temperature
nuclear process heat was reached in
  March 1991 with the start of construction of the HTTR (High
Temperature Engineering Test Reactor)
  at the Oarai Research Establishment of the Japanese Atomic
Energy Research Institute. It will be the
  first nuclear reactor in the world to be connected to a
high-temperature process heat utilization system.
  <P>
  <H3>Nuclear power in developing countries</H3>
<BR>
<A HREF="iaearole.html">Role of the IAEA in Nuclear Power
Development</A>
  <P>
  Most nuclear power plants are located in industrialized
countries, but a number of developing countries
  also are relying on the nuclear power option. At the end of
1995, there were 73 nuclear units (or about
  16% of the total number in the world) with a net capacity of
close to 45 GWe (about 13% of total
  worldwide capacity) in operation in developing countries. The
accumulated operating experience of
  these plants amounts to 850 reactor years, corresponding to an
average of 11 years of operation per
  plant. 
  <P>
  This means that nuclear power already is an established
technology in a number of developing
  countries. The deployment of nuclear power is also expected to
expand substantially in the next decade.
  It can be noted that more than half of the 39 units reported as

under construction  in 1995  were
  being built in developing countries.
  <P>
  The world's energy demands are expected to rise significantly
in the coming decades. The world
  population has nearly doubled over the last three decades and
will continue to increase.  Forecasts are
  that by the year 2020 there will be about eight billion people
living on this planet, with some 90% or
  more of the population increase taking place in developing
countries. In these countries, electricity
  consumption <I>per capita</I>, which may be used as an
indicator of standard of living, is very
  low, about one or two orders of magnitude below industrialized
countries.
  <P>
  The high cost of building nuclear power plants, however, and
financing constraints have become major
  hurdles for many developing countries. For countries with an
existing infrastructure, established nuclear
  power programmes, and an indigenous manufacturing capability,
the situation is not too bad; they need
  only to import special components, equipment and know-how from
abroad, with a corresponding
  limited spending of foreign currency.
  <P>
  In most developing countries, a suitable infrastructure and
manufacturing capability is not available.
  They generally also have a currency that is not convertible,
which means that when they buy most of
  the plant equipment from abroad, they must depend heavily on
loans from foreign banks or institutions.
  <P>
  In this context, it may be noted that when constructing the
first nuclear power plant a preferable
  approach appears to be having a  turn-key  delivery, including
a technology transfer programme. In
  that way, the possibilities of making the first plant project a
success, actually a matter of paramount
  importance for the acceptability of a nuclear programme, would
be the best. Additionally, the transfer
  of technology will enable the country to gradually develop its
own capabilities, and successively
  increase the domestic participation in subsequent nuclear power
plant projects.
  <P>
  Some developing countries, such as China, India, and the
Republic of Korea, have ambitious
  programmes for deployment of nuclear power, and are also
actively pursuing development of their own
  reactor designs. China has three nuclear units in operation, of
which one is of own design, and has
  ordered another two 950-MWe units from abroad. It also plans
construction of a WWER-1000, and is
  discussing construction of Candus with AECL of Canada. The
near-term programme includes serial
  production of a 600-MWe version of the indigenous PWR design
that is in operation at Qinshan, and
  further development of that type; construction of a heating
reactor of its own design at Daqin; and
  construction of a high temperature test reactor. 
  <P>
  India has 10 plants in operation of which six are PHWRs of own
design, and another four are under
  construction. Development activities are concentrated on a
500-MWe PHWR and a 500-MWe fast,
  sodium-cooled breeder reactor. 
  <P>
  The Republic of Korea has 11 units in operation, all supplied
by foreign vendors. With its latter units,
  the country has entered a new era, bringing on line the first
of a series of plants based on the System
  80 of ABB Combustion Engineering for which more and more
design, engineering, and equipment are
  supplied by Korean companies. Five plants of this series and of
another type are under construction,
  and a further 11 plants are planned for the period up to 2006. 
Development also has begun on the next
  generation reactor, with operation targeted for 2006.
  <P>
  Some other developments should also be noted: the supply to the
Democratic Peoples Republic of
  Korea of two PWR plants of Korean Standard Nuclear Power Plant;
Indonesia's rather firm plans on
  introduction of nuclear power within some years; Thailand's
interest in nuclear power; the Islamic
  Republic of Iran's desire to get support for completing the
Bushehr units; Pakistan's construction of one
  300-MWe PWR and its discussions on the possibilities of having
a second such unit built; Morocco's
  desire to start a feasibility study on desalination of seawater
using nuclear-supplied heat; and Egypt's
  plans on utilization of nuclear power.
  <P>
  In Eastern Europe, Armenia has restarted one of its nuclear
plants; the Czech Republic has two units
  under construction; Romania has four units under construction;
the Slovak Republic has four units
  under construction, and Ukraine has two (with plans for six)
units under construction.
  <P>
  In Latin America, Argentina and Brazil each have one unit under
construction. Argentina is also
  developing its own nuclear reactor designs.  Mexico has two
plants in operation, but no firm plans for
  further construction; in the early 1980s, it had a very
ambitious programme for nuclear power
  development that had to be abandoned for financing reasons. It
can also be noted that Venezuela has
  been discussing utilization of nuclear power plants for heat
and electricity generation; the heat is
  intended for improving the heavy oil extraction along the
Orinoco river.
  <P>
  <H3>Challenges and prospects</H3>
  <P>
  Prospects for nuclear power should be assessed in the context
of growing electricity demand and
  greater awareness of environmental issues. Nuclear power alone
will not solve all the problems, but it
  will form part of the answers.
  <P>
  Over the near term, nuclear power projects will be pursued
mostly in Asian countries, including China,
  Japan, and the Republic of Korea.  In many other regions of the
world, safe and reliable operation of
  nuclear power plants, convincing solutions to high-level
nuclear waste storage and disposal, and a
  predictable licensing process are essential prerequisites for
the revival and expansion of nuclear power.
  <P>
  Today, energy consumption trends reflect the important role
that electricity plays in modernization
  efforts and in total energy use and efficiency improvements.
Also increasingly evident is that full
  participation in the information and communication age requires
reliable sources of electricity. Studies
  have shown that there is a distinct correlation between the
trends of electricity consumption and national
  economic output in a wide range of countries. From 1960 to
1990, the share of electricity in global
  energy consumption has grown from 17% to 30% and the annual
consumption of electricity<I> per
  capita</I> has almost tripled (from 765 to 2225 kWh per
person). Still, two billion people in the
  world do not have access to electricity in their homes.
  <P>
  For years ahead, it is quite obvious that <I>per capita</I>
consumption of electricity in developing
  countries will have to increase substantially to sustain
economic growth and improve standards-of-
  living. The accelerating movement toward urbanization, which
allows easier access to electrical
  distribution systems, together with the electrification of
rural areas, will also contribute to a steadily
  increasing role for electrical power. In the Republic of Korea,
where nuclear power already is a major
  producer, <I>per capita</I> electricity consumption has grown
from 70 kWh per year in 1960 to
  almost 3200 kWh per year in 1992.
  <P>
  Over the next decades, the projected growth in the Earth's
population, mostly in developing countries,
  will place higher demands on energy and electricity supplies.
According to the World Energy Council,
  global consumption of electricity can be expected to increase
between 50% to 75% by the year 2020.
  The potential clearly exists for nuclear power to play an
important role as a safe and clean source of
  electricity to help countries meet their future energy needs.

<H2>Safety of RBMK reactors:
<BR>
Setting the technical framework</H2>
<P>
<I>The IAEA's co-operative programme is consolidating the
technical basis for further upgrading the safety of
Chernobyl-type reactors</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author_a">by Luis Lederman</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
In April 1986, unit 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in
Ukraine was destroyed in the worst accident in the history of
commercial nuclear power. The reactor, which started operation in
1983, was a Soviet-designed nuclear power plant known by the
Russian acronym RBMK.
<P>
The RBMK evolved from Soviet uranium-graphite reactors whose
purpose was the production of  plutonium. The first of these
plutonium production reactors began operation in 1948. Six years
later, in 1954, a demonstration 5-MWe RBMK-type reactor for
electricity generation began operation in Obninsk. Subsequently a
series of RBMKs were developed using the combination of graphite
moderation and water cooling in a channel design.
<P>
Today 15 RBMK power reactors are producing electricity in three
States: 11 units in Russia, two in Ukraine, and two in Lithuania.
The gross electric power rating of all but two RBMKs is 1000 MWe;
the exceptions are the two units at Ignalina in Lithuania which
are rated at 1300 MWe gross. 
<P>
All operating RBMKs were connected to electric power grids during
the period 1973 (Leningrad-1) to 1990 (Smolensk-3). They
represent distinct generations of reactors having significant
differences with respect to their safety design features.
<P>  
Six plants are considered  first-generation  units (Leningrad-1
and -2, Kursk-1 and -2, and Chernobyl-1 and -2). They were
designed and brought on line in the early-to-mid 1970s, before
new standards on the design and construction of nuclear power
plants (OPB-82) were introduced in the Soviet Union. Units
brought on line since the late 1970s and early 1980s are
generally grouped as  second-generation  RBMKs (Leningrad-3 and
-4; Kursk-3, and -4; Ignalina-1; Chernobyl-3; and Smolensk-1 and
-2). Ignalina-2 contains safety features beyond those of other
second generation units. These RBMKs were designed and
constructed in accordance with the updated standards issued in
1982. 
<P>
After the Chernobyl accident, Soviet safety standards were
revised again (OPB-88). One RBMK (Smolensk-3) has been built to
these  third-generation  standards. Additional design changes now
are being incorporated in the construction of Kursk-5.
<P>
Over the past decade, a considerable amount of work has been
carried out by Russian designers and operators to improve the
safety of RBMK reactors and to eliminate the causes that led to
the Chernobyl accident. As a result, major design and operational
modifications have been implemented. However, safety concerns
remain, particularly regarding the first-generation units.
<P>
This article reviews major efforts for improving the safety of
RBMK reactors through a co-operative IAEA programme initiated in
1992. (See <A HREF="rbmkbox1.html">box</A>) Specifically covered
are technical findings of safety reviews related to the design
and operation of the plants, and the documentation of findings
through an Agency database intended to facilitate the technical
co-ordination of ongoing national and international efforts for
improving RBMK safety.
<P>
<A HREF="rbmksafe.html"><H3>Scope of the RBMK safety
programme</H3></A>
<P>
The IAEA's RBMK safety programme aims to consolidate results of
various national, bilateral, and multilateral activities and to
establish international consensus on required safety improvements
and related priorities. It assists both regulatory and operating
organizations and provides a basis for technical and financial
decisions. A wide range of activities are covered, and since
1992, a number of reviews and assessments have been conducted.
Smolensk-3 and Ignalina-2 have served as RBMK reference plants
during the programme's first phase.
<P>
The IAEA conducted a first review of safety improvements proposed
for RBMKs in October 1992. In June 1993, a safety assessment of
design solutions and proposed safety improvements of Smolensk-3
was organized. It was conducted by an international group of
experts and IAEA staff over a period of 2 weeks at the plant
site. Smolensk-3 is the most advanced of the operating RBMK
plants and its design incorporates safety improvements identified
from analyses of the Chernobyl accident and other studies. A
similar review was performed for the Ignalina units in October
1994.
<P>
Additionally, the Agency's Assessment of Safety Significant Event
Teams (ASSET) have reviewed the plant-specific operational
experience at all RBMK sites. An Operational Safety Review Team
(OSART) mission also was conducted at Ignalina in September 1995.
<P>  
Experts also have reviewed the design of plant shutdown systems
at Smolensk-3. The review   the subject of an IAEA consultants'
meeting in Switzerland in December 1993   was based on IAEA
Nuclear Safety Standards (NUSS) documents; national standards
(Russia, Canada, and Germany); and regulatory practices of the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
International experts fully supported the intent of Russian
designers to improve the RBMK shutdown systems.
<P>
Another matter receiving attention has been the analysis of a
multiple pressure tube rupture in RBMK-type reactors. At a
topical meeting in Moscow in January 1994, participants examined
the relevant regulatory approaches adopted in Member States
operating channel-type reactors and reviewed the methodology,
criteria, and results from safety analyses. They agreed on the
urgent need to validate computer codes used for studying
loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) scenarios in RBMKs. In November
1994, at an IAEA consultants' meeting in Japan, a validation
matrix for code calculation was established, and in 1995 the IAEA
started an international exercise based on experimental results
made available by Japan.
<P>
Activities of the IAEA's RBMK safety programme are co-ordinated
with those of an international consortium on the  Safety of
Design Solutions and Operation of Nuclear Power Plants with RBMK
Reactors  established under auspices of the European Commission.
The two programmes use the same RBMK reference plants.
<P>
With the completion in 1994 of the safety reviews of Smolensk-3
and Ignalina-2, these two programmes reached important
milestones. To make results available to the international
technical community, the IAEA convened a technical meeting in
May-June 1995. Results from both the IAEA and EC programmes were
presented, thereby reflecting the large amount of work done by
the international experts and Russian organizations to review the
safety of RBMK nuclear power plants.
<P>  
Both projects produced a large number of recommendations for
enhancing the safety of RBMK plants. Most of them correlate with
the measures already included in national programmes for RBMK
units which are under way in Russia, Lithuania, and Ukraine.
<P>
Based on the initial phase of its programme, the IAEA prepared a
consolidated list of design and operational safety issues for
RBMKs. For this work, a database of findings and recommendations
for RBMKs compiled by the IAEA was used. All findings and
recommendations from the various technical meetings, safety
reviews of Smolensk and Ignalina, and ASSET reports of the EC's
International Consortium were collected in the database and
further grouped by topical areas into safety issues. Also
included is plant-specific safety information provided by the 
main design institute for RBMK reactors in Moscow. 
<P>
The Agency's database has an interface with the databank
established by the G-24 Nuclear Safety Co-ordination Group, thus
making joint analyses of safety topics and assistance projects
easier. 
<P>
<H3>Results from the IAEA
programme</H3>
<P>
The IAEA's programme identifies <A HREF="rbmktabl.html">58 RBMK
safety issues</A> related to seven topical areas. Issues related
to six design areas are further ranked according to their
perceived impact on plant safety. Safety issues connected to
operational areas, particularly those related to the assurance of
a high degree of safety culture, are all considered very
important. 
<P>  
The ranking of a safety issue does not necessarily imply that all
the proposed recommendations have the same urgency for
implementation. Therefore, recommendations have to be further
considered on a plant-specific basis. <I>(<A
HREF="rbmkbasi.html">RBMK Basic Design and
Safety Improvements</A>)</I>
<P>
Two broad issues addressing quality assurance (QA) and regulatory
matters are not specifically attributed to any particular topical
area, but they are recognized as affecting all areas. From the QA
standpoint, the main concern relates to ensuring the use of the
actual plant status and configuration for various analyses,
safety reviews, and safety improvements. Another aspect is
ensuring that the relevant design documentation is updated as the
plant configuration is modified and upgraded. It is therefore of
utmost importance that the organizational structure promotes
awareness of safety concerns, responds quickly in evaluating
these concerns, and implements timely corrective actions if they
are warranted. 
<P>
Exactly how and when identified safety issues are addressed is a
matter to be resolved between the operating organization and the
regulatory body. The IAEA safety reviews are intended to help by
providing international expertise to assist in this process. The
reviews draw upon the IAEA's NUSS publications, the Russian
regulations, and national practices. Recommendations and
conclusions are only intended to provide an additional technical
basis for decisions to improve the safety of RBMKs. National
authorities have sole responsibility for the regulation and safe
operation of their nuclear power plants. Therefore, the results
do not replace a comprehensive safety assessment which needs to
be performed in the frame of the national licensing process.
<P>
<A HREF="rbmkover.html"><H3>Overview of Technical
Findings</H3></A>
<P>
<B><I>Core Design and Core Monitoring</I></B>. The direct causes
of the Chernobyl accident were related to the reactor core
design. Therefore, safety improvements have been initially
focused on identified shortcomings related to core physics.
<P>
To date, considerable work has been completed to decrease the
core void reactivity coefficient and to increase the efficiency
of the shutdown system. However, important issues remain to be
resolved. They include the problem of the void reactivity
associated with the loss of coolant from channels of the control
and protection system (CPS); and the issue of independent and
diverse reactor shutdown. International experts thus strongly
support the intent of Russian designers to develop and modernize
the RBMK CPS to provide a higher safety level.
<P>
Another issue of high significance to safety relates to the
operational reactivity margin (ORM). The ORM has to be controlled
in order to maintain the void reactivity coefficient, the
effectiveness of the shutdown system, and the power distribution
within defined safety limits. With the present design, it is the
responsibility of the operator alone to keep the ORM within the
corresponding limits. IAEA programme experts have recommended the
automation of shutdown actions when the ORM value falls below the
safety limits.
<P>
Other aspects of importance concern the process of analyzing RBMK
design and safety. Such analyses have been done using
calculational tools available at that time. These tools (e.g.
computer codes) generally did not have the capability to
adequately model spatial interactions between neutronics and
thermohydraulics. Consequently, efforts are being directed at the
development of three-dimensional methods for analyzing neutron
fields, coolant density, and temperature distribution of fuel and
graphite. IAEA programme experts have recommended that these
methods be used to confirm results of previous safety analyses as
well as for further studies.
<P>
<B><I>Instrumentation and Control (I&C)</I></B>. The major
concerns related to the segregation between the electronic
systems and the level of diversity present in the most important
systems and equipment. For example, the flux control system
shares many common elements with the shutdown system. Although
there is considerable resilience in the system due to the high
level of redundancy, the two systems would be vulnerable to
common mode failure, and thus control and protection could be
lost simultaneously. The Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) is
initiated by a combination of signals. However, there is no
sufficient assurance that the system responds promptly nor that
the actuation equipment is designed against single failures. 
<P>
A safety issue ranked as  medium  is the replacement of the
station's main computers. The situation differs from site to
site. The equipment in Ignalina, for example, is showing distinct
signs of ageing with thermally induced warping of boards and
embrittlement of the plastic edge connectors. A number of other
issues related to I&C could be improved by local measures at the
plant. These include test and maintenance procedures and the
recording and use of failure data.
<P>
<B><I>Pressure Boundary Integrity</I></B>. Some primary coolant
circuit components and piping are outside of the accident
localization system. In first-generation RBMKs, a guillotine
break in the  piping can result in damage to civil structures.
Application of the leak-before-break concept would reduce the
risk of primary coolant circuit failures. Work is going on to
demonstrate the applicability of this concept for RBMK conditions
and to implement the method and techniques.
<P>
To date, there have been three single-channel ruptures due to the
blockage of water flow or an imbalance in the flow-to-power
ratio. Recommendations therefore call for analyzing and
implementing, as feasible, the reduction of the number of in-line
components, whose failure can block water flow. 
<P>
The IAEA programme's safety reviews indicate that at some plants
operation has continued even though the frequency and the number
of examinations required by national regulations for the reactor
pressure boundary are not performed, or when the results have not
been satisfactory. The existing time schedules for implementing
modifications, performing additional analysis, and maintaining
required record-keeping are sometimes not followed. Criteria for
limiting plant operation in these cases are not established.
<P>
The required volume of in-service inspection (ISI) is not
fulfilled in practice. It was found that in some cases the
required number of fuel channels was not inspected. The approach
adopted at RBMK plants to repair identified critical defects
differs from the predictive approach adopted for ISI elsewhere.
Pre-service inspection records and ISI predictive records are not
maintained. The existing equipment and procedures are inadequate
to give reproducible measurements of small defects below the
critical size.
<P>
<B><I>Accident Analysis</I></B>. The scope of analysis of
postulated accidents available in the technical justification of
safety (TOB) for RBMKs was determined by national regulations
effective when the TOB was issued. Compared to current practices,
it was found to be limited and the related information usually
does not provide a clear description of assumptions used in the
analysis. Computer codes used at the time of RBMK design were of
limited modeling capability. The lack of an experimental database
on pipe rupture of the primary heat transport system limited the
possibility of integral code validation. More modern Russian
codes and some Western codes now are being used, but they have
not been sufficiently validated for modeling RBMKs.
<P>
The review further found a number of areas to be incomplete,
including the analysis of Design Basis Accidents (DBA); the
adequacy of the codes, database, validation, and documentation
for the analysis of loss-of-coolant accidents; and the
sensitivity to parameter variations and uncertainties.
Additionally, anticipated transients without scram (ATWS) were
considered of high safety significance and the analysis of these
events needs to be performed.
<P>
The completeness of such analysis is of utmost importance to
ensure the safe plant design. The analysis should identify
possible shortcomings of the existing design and be performed
using modern and qualified methods. As design changes are
implemented in the plants, the analysis also needs to be
updated. An example of this process is the safety analysis report
(SAR) work now being performed for the Ignalina plant.
<P>
A useful tool in identifying weaknesses and prioritizing
improvements is probabilistic safety assessment (PSA). Therefore
the performance and peer review of a plant-specific PSA for all
RBMKs is recommended.
<P>
<B><I>Safety and Support Systems</I></B>. In general, it has been
found that the high redundancy which exists in several of the
front-line safety systems is not present to the same extent in
supporting systems, such as the service water and intermediate
cooling systems. Moreover, the high level of redundancy in the
safety systems cannot always be given full credit due to
potential common cause failures.
<P>
The reliability of the safety systems is dependent on the system
design and alignment and on operational parameters, such as
maintenance and testing procedures and emergency operating
procedures. Therefore, a strong tie needs to be maintained
between this area and the development of emergency operating
procedures and testing procedures.
<P>
In general, it has been found that the differences between the
plants are so important that recommendations in this area have to
be evaluated on a plant-specific basis.
<P>
<B><I>Fire Protection</I></B>. Passive fire protection can
address fire safety problems in an effective way. Passive fire
protection comprises all the measures that are put in place
before the start of operation and are not expected to need any
human or mechanical action in case of fire. The basis for
prevention of fire damage is the minimization of the amount of
burnable material and fire loads. Total elimination of burnable
material is preferred, but where this is not possible, the fire
load has to be separated into different fire compartments. The
basis for compartmentation is the separation of safety
significant equipment from each other and from hazardous
substances. Compartment boundaries should consist of fixed fire
barriers such as walls, floors, ceiling, and mechanical and
electrical penetration seals. Also within compartments, important
elements may need fire separation. This may take place through
distance or local separative elements.
<P>
Fire risks were not adequately considered in the design phase of
RBMK reactors when passive measures could have easily been
implemented. However, much work has been done afterwards. 
Removal of the largest fire load, the plastic floor coating, has
started gradually. Improvement of compartmentation has been
carried out by upgrading fire doors and penetration sealings.
Within the compartments the main improvement effort has been the
covering of cables with a fire resistant protective coating.

<P>
These problems have already been tackled to some extent in some
RBMK units. In other cases this has been taken care of by a newer
design, by national upgrading programmes, or by
bilateral/international assistance programmes. 
<P>
Throughout the plant, all areas with burnable material should be
provided with fire detection equipment connected to a proper
alarm system. The existing systems need both extension and
quality upgrading. Some plants have started these measures as a
part of their own upgrading programme, and some in connection
with bilaterally or internationally financed programmes.
<P>
Manual fire suppression capability is generally very strong at
nuclear power plants in the former Soviet Union. This applies to
the number and the training of fire brigade personnel.
Deficiencies, however, exist in the personal protective
equipment, communication equipment, and fire fighting equipment,
such as fire extinguishers, hoses, and nozzles. 
Automatic fire suppression is mainly realized through fixed water
sprinkler and deluge extinguishing systems. Local carbon dioxide
or foam extinguishing systems also exist. The reliability and
coverage of the existing systems need evaluation. Automatic fixed
water extinguishing systems should be added to some compartments
which so far have not been fully protected. 
<P>
The reliable supply of water assures proper availability and
operation of both manual and automatic fire suppression
capability. However, differences between sites and the different
generations of RBMKs are extensive and measures of different
magnitude are needed.
<P>
<B><I>Operational Safety</I></B>. Past experience in the
operation of nuclear power plants confirms the important role of
plant personnel in assuring nuclear safety. Considerable
attention has been given to the study of human factors in plant
operation. Overall, it has been found that the operational safety
of RBMKs can be upgraded. Identified safety issues include those
relating to the training of operators; operating and emergency
management procedures; and surveillance, maintenance, and control
of plant modifications. Recommendations have been made in these
areas and should be implemented in parallel with proposed design
and safety improvements.
<P>
<H3>A stronger technical basis</H3>
<P>
On the basis of national and multilateral safety reviews, the
main safety concerns of the more modern RBMK nuclear power plants
have been identified and the required safety improvements have
been agreed upon.
<P>
Despite the work carried out to date, safety concerns remain,
particularly those related to the first-generation units. Future
IAEA activities will focus on assisting in the review of
first-generation units and on streamlining efforts to resolve
generic safety issues.
<P>
Up-to-date information on the plant-specific status of operating
RBMKs is essential for an effective exchange of technical
information and for the co-ordination of national and
international efforts to improve nuclear safety. The database
established by the IAEA is an effective tool to facilitate this
co-ordination. The work ahead will enable the compilation of more
plant-specific information in the interests of tracking the
status of safety improvements and identifying areas where more
efforts need to be taken.

<H2>Chernobyl & the marine environment: 
<BR>
The radiological impact in context</H2>
<P>
<I>Scientists at the IAEA's Marine Environment Laboratory in
Monaco have played an integral role in post-Chernobyl studies</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author">by Pavel Povinec, Scott Fowler, and
Murdoch Baxter</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Chernobyl nuclear accident in April 1986 had a significant
impact on both the terrestrial and marine environments. The total
activity of the nuclear debris released was so high
(1-2.10<SUP>18</SUP> becquerel) that the radioactive fallout
distributed widely after the accident actually dominated
anthropogenic environmental levels in various parts of the
world.
<P>
Concentrations of anthropogenic radionuclides generally vary
from region to region, according to the location and magnitude of
the different sources of contamination. The main global
contribution to marine radioactivity, as in the terrestrial
environment, is still from fallout from nuclear tests in the
atmosphere, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s. 
<P>
However, in some regions, like the Irish and North Seas, the
concentrations of anthropogenic radionuclides (e.g. caesium-137
and plutonium-239) in the marine environment have been
significantly influenced by discharges (e.g. from European
reprocessing plants). On the other hand, the Baltic and
Black Seas have been the seas most affected by the Chernobyl
accident. In all these latter regions the spatial and temporal
trends in the concentrations of anthropogenic radionuclides have
been quite dynamic. They are a result of changing source terms
and marine processes, including horizontal and vertical transport
in seawater, marine sedimentation, resuspension from sediment and
biological uptake, and food-chain transfer.
<P>
<H3>IAEA-MEL tracer studies</H3>
<P>
The Chernobyl accident, perhaps surprisingly, was of
considerable interest to oceanographers around the world. The
accidental release of substantial amounts of radioactivity to the
atmosphere essentially initiated a worldwide transient tracer
experiment on a scale that would never have been planned
deliberately. Shortly after the accident, fission and activation
products released by the fire entered marine waters throughout
Europe. They became involved in many of the elemental cycles that
oceanographers have for decades been trying to characterize using
a wide variety of conventional techniques. Suddenly, immediately
after the Chernobyl accident, a suite of radioactive tracers
became available as a pulse to trace, rather like a coloured dye,
the movement of elements through the oceans. IAEA-MEL scientists
took part in this exciting and serendipitous experiment through
temporal radionuclide monitoring of both the coastal and open
ocean ecosystems.
<P>
For open sea work, one of the most important innovations in
marine monitoring over the past 15 years has been the development
of sediment traps to directly measure fluxes of materials
associated with sinking particles. Moored sediment traps can be
left unattended at any depth in the ocean to collect discrete,
time-series samples at pre-determined intervals.
<P>
As part of a joint French-IAEA study of open Mediterranean
particle flux, in mid-April 1986, IAEA-MEL scientists had, by a
happy coincidence of timing, moored their automated time-series
sediment trap at a depth of 200 meters in the Ligurian Sea
between Monaco and the island of Corsica. In order to study
timescale changes in particle flux, each of the six trap
collection cups was set to sample sinking particles for
consecutive periods of 6.25 days. Following the accident on 26
April, atmospheric measurements made at Monaco by IAEA-MEL
indicated that most of the peak Chernobyl fallout entered the
Ligurian Sea essentially as a single pulse during the period 4-5
May.
<P>
The sediment trap was retrieved on 22 May and the particulate
material, along with other marine samples, was analyzed for
radioactivity by gamma spectrometry. The radioanalyses showed
that the primary pulse of particulate radionuclides arrived at
200 meters depth between 8 and 15 May, that is only about seven
days after peak radioactivity was delivered to the sea surface.
The time lag implied an average sinking speed of the radioactive
particles of approximately 30 meters per day. This pulse of
radioactivity sinking through 200 meters was particularly evident
for the particle-reactive fission products (e.g. zirconium,
niobium, and cerium radionuclides) which were either not
detectable or present in very low amounts in the last sediment
trap sample collected after 15 May. 
<P>
The rapid descent of these radionuclides on a  timescale of a
few days indicated that they were not sinking as fallout
particles according to Stokesian settling models. Rather, they
were incorporated into large aggregates which are known to sink
at speeds of tens to hundreds of meters per day.
<P>
From earlier laboratory research at IAEA-MEL, it was suspected
at the time of the accident that biological activity in surface
waters might be responsible for absorbing radionuclides like a
sponge and removing them to depth. Primary production of minute
plant-like phytoplankton cells creates solid surfaces onto which
contaminants like radionuclides are adsorbed. The zooplankton
which feed on these  radioactive cells subsequently defecate
large aggregates (fecal pellets) which can further scavenge
radioactivity as they sink. 
<P>
Therefore, to test this hypothesis, on 6 May 1986 live
zooplankton were netted from the waters over the sediment trap
and allowed to defecate in special aquaria on board ship. When
analyzed, these freshly produced fecal pellets were found to
contain radionuclides with similar concentrations and
relative distributions as were present in the sinking particles
trapped at 200 meters. Microscopic examination of the trap
samples confirmed that they were rich (70% by weight) in the same
type of fecal pellets as the netted zooplankton had produced.
Thus, this accidental  field experiment  was actually the first
direct and convincing demonstration of the biological processes
by which ocean waters are  cleansed of contaminants like
radionuclides.
<P>
Following the Chernobyl accident, the different radionuclides
which entered the surrounding seas were removed to different
degrees depending upon their chemical reactivities. For example,
in the case of the particle-reactive radionuclides, cerium-141,
cerium-144, and plutonium-239+240, from 50% to 75% of the total
radionuclide inventories deposited in this region of the
Mediterranean had transited through 200 meter depth by one month
after the accident when the sediment trap stopped sampling. In 
sharp contrast, only 0.2% of the corresponding caesium-137
deposition had passed through 200 meters by that time, an
observation which is consistent with the generally non-reactive
behaviour of this long-lived nuclide in seawater. For this
reason, Chernobyl-derived caesium-137 has proved to be very
useful as a water mass movement tracer in the Mediterranean and
other seas for several years after the accident.
<P>  
IAEA-MEL was not the only group of marine scientists deploying
sediment traps in European waters following the Chernobyl
accident; time-series traps were collecting particles at nearly
the same time in the North Sea, the Black Sea, and Lake Zurich.
Where comparisons could be made, concentrations of
Chernobyl-derived radionuclides in the different sinking
particles were surprisingly similar, and in most cases biological
activity in the upper water column was considered to be the
driving force in transporting the radioactivity downward.
However, large differences in radionuclide flux were evident
due to variations in particle mass flux which is normally site
and depth specific. The extreme case was observed in Lake Zurich
where roughly 20% of the fallout was removed from the water
column in two months due to the sinking of a massive bloom of
calcareous algae. 
<P>
Viewed collectively, the temporal flux data for the Chernobyl
radionuclides collected throughout Europe after the accident have
proven extremely important for refining general models of
contaminant removal and transport in aquatic systems.
<P>
<H3>Environmental & radiological aspects</H3>
<P>
Of more than 20 radionuclides which were released in
significant quantities during the Chernobyl accident, only a few
have been studied extensively in the marine environment. Among
the most important have been strontium-90, caesium-134,
caesium-137, and plutonium-239+240. Other radionuclides, such as
iodine-131, have half-lives that are too short to be harmful or
relevant to understanding marine processes, or had very low
concentrations (for example, iodine-129). 
<P>
As mentioned previously, considerable differences in marine
behaviour were observed. Strontium-90 and caesium-137 are typical
representatives of elements which are soluble in seawater and can
be used for studies of water dynamics. Their particle reactivity
is very low in comparison to, for example, plutonium isotopes,
which lie at the other extreme, in a group of elements having low
solubility and high particle reactivity. Plutonium isotopes do
not travel long distances from the source because they are
deposited into sediment, which therefore contains their
main inventory in the ocean. 
<P>
As the plutonium input to the oceans following the Chernobyl
accident was small and localized, this article will concentrate
on discussing the impact of Chernobyl radiocaesium on the marine
environment. The caesium isotopes were both the most widespread
and most abundant of the ones released.
<P>
The behaviour of radiocaesium in the oceans has been studied
over a long period with reference to its fallout from nuclear
bomb tests and in discharges from nuclear reprocessing plants. In
particular, discharges from Sellafield in the United Kingdom have
been extensively used to study water and sediment dynamics in the
Irish, North, and Norwegian Seas. The radiocaesium from weapons
test fallout was exclusively caesium-137. Caesium-134 has,
however, been present in Sellafield discharges as well as in
Chernobyl debris. The ratios of caesium-134 to caesium-137 have
been different, however. Caesium from Chernobyl was  thus 
readily distinguishable from other sources by having a different
caesium-134/caesium-137 activity ratio of about 1:2.
<P>
Radiologically, the sea most affected by the Chernobyl accident
was the Baltic, since the first radioactive clouds from Chernobyl
travelled to the north and caused high deposition over the
Scandinavian region. Atmospheric deposition played a dominant
role in determining the radioactivity of this sea. The mean
caesium-137 concentration in surface waters estimated for the
reference year 1990 was highest in the Baltic Sea. <I>(See
maps.)</I> Because of the closed nature of this sea and its
small exchange of water with the North Sea, the levels of
caesium-137 of this sea have remained the highest in Europe. 
<P>
Caesium-137 contours shown on the map of the Baltic Sea for the
period 1986-88 illustrate the enhancement of caesium-137
concentrations in seawater, with clear evidence of the effect of
run-off from land, particularly from Sweden. The measured range
in 1986 was from a few becquerel (Bq) to 2400 Bq per cubic meter,
i.e. two to three orders of magnitude higher than in other
European seas.
<P>
The next most perturbed sea following the Chernobyl accident
was the Black Sea, where the mean caesium-137 concentration in
seawater in 1990 was 52 Bq per cubic meter, comparable to that in
the Irish Sea. The highest deposited activity was observed in
1986 in its northernmost area, about 500 Bq per cubic meter, i.e.
30 times higher than the pre-accident values. Strontium-90
activity measured in  1988 in surface waters of the western Black
Sea was mostly between 10 and 50 Bq per cubic meter. Generally, a
similar distribution was observed in 1988 for caesium-137 as
well, but the levels were higher for this radionuclide by a
factor of two. Strontium-90 and caesium-137 surface
concentrations in Aegean Sea waters were much lower, between 5
and 11 Bq per cubic meter. The distribution patterns of
strontium-90 and caesium-137 observed in the surface waters
of the Black Sea can be explained in terms of two main source
functions   namely by a short-term atmospheric deposition which
dominated immediately after the accident, and then by a long-term
transfer from the Kiev Reservoir and the catchment area of the
Dnieper, Dniester, and Danube rivers.
<P>
For the Mediterranean Sea, the main Chernobyl contribution then
arrived by exchange of waters with the Black Sea, which has
essentially acted as a radioactive source. Atmospheric deposition
and river inputs were estimated to have played minor roles. The
mean caesium-137 concentration in surface  water estimated for
1990 was 5.7 Bq per cubic meter. The caesium-137 levels in
regional seas as estimated by the Commission of the European
Community's MARINA-MED project ranged from 2.9 to 9 Bq per cubic
meter, clearly showing a west-east trend towards the highest
values in the Aegean Sea.
<P>
<H3>Technical assistance and training</H3>
<P>
The IAEA has been active in assisting Member States both to
monitor and understand the effects of the Chernobyl accident on
their marine systems. Firstly, in the Black Sea region where
Chernobyl radioactivity is among the foremost public concerns in
relation to health, the IAEA has initiated a major
programme of technical co-operation. Activities are directed at
strengthening the capabilities of the regional Member States to
measure and monitor marine radioactivity, especially
alpha-emitters, and involve careful evaluation and selection of
equipment and training approaches. 
<P>
In November 1994, a 2-week regional training course on marine
radioactivity monitoring was held in Istanbul. In addition, a
complementary Co-ordinated Research Programme (CRP) on isotopic
tracers in the Black Sea has been carried out. It is being done
with a view to using the Chernobyl pulse of radionuclides and
related nuclear techniques to understand water movement and
element cycling in the heavily polluted marine system.
<P>
In the Baltic Sea, the Helsinki Commission MORS programme
(Monitoring of Radioactive Substances) has received significant
support from IAEA-MEL in terms of organization of specially
designed analytical quality assurance exercises for marine
radioactivity assay. This support will be further increased by
the organization, in Finland, of an IAEA training course on
marine radioactivity studies in   September 1996. Again, the work
will feature particular reference to the Chernobyl impact and to
the needs of the new Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania) which have joined the IAEA.
<P>
<H3>Overview of marine radioactivity</H3>
<P>
An overview of marine radioactivity perspectives has been
provided by the IAEA's recently completed CRP,  Sources of
Radioactivity in the Marine Environment and their Relative
Contributions to Overall Dose Assessment from Marine
Radioactivity (MARDOS). This study provided new up-to-date
estimates of doses to the public from anthropogenic caesium-137
(originating from global fallout, the Chernobyl accident, and
authorized discharges) and from natural polonium-210 through
consumption of marine food. 
<P>
It included a study of fishing areas as defined by the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Analysis of
fishing area No.37 (the Mediterranean and Black Seas) has shown
that the collective effective dose commitment for caesium-137 in
marine food (fish and shellfish) in 1990 was 6 man sievert (Sv) - 
much smaller than the 700 man Sv derived from polonium-210
ingestion. The highest doses (86 man Sv) in world oceans due to
caesium-137 were found in the North Atlantic area (FAO fishing
area No. 27, which also includes the Irish, North, Baltic,
Norwegian, and Barents Seas). However, they are still negligible
in comparison with 2900 man Sv derived from polonium-210
ingestion.
<P>
Generally, it can be concluded that the Chernobyl accident has
had a measurable impact on the marine  environment. Radionuclide
levels (mainly caesium-137) were two to three orders of magnitude
higher than the pre-Chernobyl levels. However, the doses to the
public from ingestion of caesium-137 in marine food have been
estimated to be at least an order of magnitude lower than those
due to natural polonium-210.

<P>
Accidents involving radioactive materials in recent years 
have had consequences for the health of the general public. These
have ranged from the major accident at Chernobyl in 1986 to
accidental dispersion of medical and industrial radioactive
sources.
<P>
Responses to these accidents differed between countries. It later
became apparent that some protective actions were taken that, in
the most extreme cases, may have worsened, rather than improved,
the well-being of the populations involved and their
environmental surroundings. In other cases, the actions led to
large but unproductive expenditures of national resources.
Further, where the accident involved exposure of populations
across national boundaries, many instances occurred of
contradictory national responses either side of the national
borders. 
<P>
During the past decade considerable progress has been made in
developing internationally recognized principles for decisions on
protective measures following accidents involving radioactive
materials, and in providing quantitative guidance for applying
these principles. Efforts have involved the IAEA, the
International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), World
Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), Commission of the European Communities (CEC), and Nuclear
Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD/NEA).
<P>
This article summarizes guidance on the radiation protection
criteria that have been established with regard to responding to
nuclear accidents or radiological emergencies, and the principles
for establishing intervention levels. The guidance was developed
to assist those at national and regional bodies and at nuclear
facilities having responsibility for emergency response planning.
<P>
<H3>Establishing international consensus</H3> 
<P>
In 1985, the Agency published <I>Safety Series No. 72</I>, which
set out guidance on the principles for establishing intervention
levels for the protection of the public in the event of a nuclear
accident or radiological emergency. That guidance was aimed at
assisting national and regional authorities having responsibility
for emergency response planning to specify levels of projected
dose at which it may be necessary to introduce relevant
protective measures. It recognized a need for practical
quantities that could be readily compared with the results 
of measurements made in environmental materials and in
foodstuffs, so-called Derived Intervention Levels (DILs). Shortly
after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986,
the Agency published <I>Safety Series No. 81</I>, which addressed
the principles, procedures, and data needed to establish these
DILS. Guidance was also given on the extent to which the
supportive numerical data and the illustrative DlLs might have
more generic application. 
<P>
Additionally over the past decade, new recommendations for
radiation protection have been issued by the ICRP; the FAO/WHO
Codex Alimentarius Commission published Guideline Levels of
Radionuclides in Food Moving in International Trade; WHO issued
recommendations on Derived Intervention Levels for Protecting the
Public; and the International Chernobyl Project made a number of
important recommendations. 
<P>
In 1991, the IAEA revised its <I>Safety Series No. 72</I> to
clarify 
the guidance with respect to intervention, and provided
illustrative examples of how intervention levels are established
in emergency plans. It stopped short of providing numerical
intervention levels that might have some generic application. 
<P>
The emergency response to the Chernobyl accident underscored 
the need for a simple set of consistent intervention levels at
the international level. Such a set of values was considered
desirable to increase public confidence in authorities charged
with dealing with the aftermath of an accident. Additionally,
since many countries do not have nuclear facilities and hence
detailed emergency plans themselves, a simple internationally
agreed set can assist them in the event of transboundary
releases. 
<P>
In the process of establishing international consensus on the
values of these generic intervention levels, the IAEA convened a
number of technical meetings. The work led to the preparation, in
1993, of <I>Safety Series No. 109, Intervention Criteria in a
Nuclear or Radiation Emergency</I>. This Safety Guide, published
in 1994, represents the international consensus reached on
principles for intervention and numerical values for generic
intervention levels. These principles and values subsequently 
became the basis of intervention guidance in the <I>Basic Safety 
Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the
Safety of Radiation Sources</I>, which have been issued jointly
by the IAEA, FAO, ILO, NEA, PAHO, and WHO.
<P>
<H3>Summary of guidance</H3>
<P>
<B><I>Prompt and Delayed Radiation Effects on Health.</I></B> For
most prompt (or deterministic) effects on health, the severity is
related to the level of dose to the individual and there is a
practical threshold radiation dose below which effects are not
clinically observable. The most severe consequence is death,
which may occur in sensitive individuals, due to bone marrow
failure, at doses above one gray (Gy) delivered promptly to the
whole body. Serious prompt effects may also occur in other
organs. Most of the threshold doses for these are above that for
bone marrow and will be avoided if the dose to the whole body is
below one Gy. However, some individual organs, such as the
thyroid and the lung, may receive high doses due to breathing or
swallowing certain radionuclides and must be considered
separately. 
<P>
Delayed (or stochastic) effects include a wide range of cancers
and hereditary effects, for which the probability of occurrence
(not the severity) increases with dose. They usually appear many
years after exposure, and, although they do not occur in every
exposed individual, there is no threshold for their induction.
Because of the assumed linear (proportional) relationship between
dose and the probability of these effects, it is possible to
estimate the number expected to occur in a large exposed
population even if the chance of an effect is very small for most
individuals. Since other causes (mostly unidentified) can give
rise to the same effects, it will be usually impossible to 
identify those caused by radiation.
<P>
Typically, even a severe accident will cause high doses to
relatively few and small doses to many people. Most cancers and
hereditary effects will occur in large populations that receive
small doses. These usually cannot all be avoided and the
objective of intervention is to reduce their number as much as is
reasonably possible.
<P>
<B><I>Exposure Routes and Dose Projections.</I></B>  Although
accidental  releases may occur to air, water, or land, those most
likely to require urgent protective action are major releases to
air. Following such a release people may be exposed to radiation
from the airborne radioactive cloud and through inhalation of
radioactive dust from the cloud. As the cloud disperses,
particles will slowly settle on the earth's surface or be
deposited rapidly by rainfall. People then may be exposed to 
radiation from these deposits, from inhaling resuspended dust, or
from contaminated food or water.
<P>
During an accident, potential doses to the population will
usually be estimated by well-qualified professionals. However,
early on, there are many uncertainties (e.g., in the amount and
rate at which radioactive material is being released and in the
meteorological situation). Because of this and the need to use
simple mathematical models to obtain results soon enough to be
useful, there will be large uncertainties in early dose
estimates.
<P>
Decision-makers must be aware of this situation and ensure that
their expert advisors provide an expression of uncertainties in
early estimates of projected doses. They should not rely on most
likely estimates alone (which could lead to wrong conclusions
with severe repercussions for the population) and must consider
the uncertainties in arriving at a suitable decision on urgent
protective action. Later, as the situation becomes clearer, it
will be possible to modify and initiate protective actions with a
much firmer grasp of projected doses.
<P>
<B><I>Normal and Emergency Situations.</I></B> Under normal
conditions, doses  from man-made sources (e.g., from nuclear
power or the practice of medicine) are kept within specified
levels. These are much lower than would prompt a need for
protective action; typically they are comparable to local
variations in natural background radiation. They are achieved
through the use of controls on the radiation source and do not
require direct constraints on people.
<P>
In the event of an accident, radioactive material released into
the environment is no longer under control; doses can only be
reduced through protective actions - such as evacuation,
sheltering, relocation, resettlement, prophylatic use of iodine,
and restrictions on food and water - all of which impose
constraints on people's activities. These actions may also incur
additional risks. Therefore, in choosing the level at which a
protective action should be initiated, it is necessary to
consider the effects of constraints on people's activities 
and any additional risks from the action itself. 
<P>
For the above reasons, the levels of dose for intervention
following an accident and the levels for control of doses under
normal conditions will be different and it is important to avoid
confusion between the roles of these two different kinds of
levels.
<P>
<B><I>Protective Actions.</I></B> There are limited major options
available to protect the public after an accident. The most
important are the following:
<P>
<I>For early, or urgent, response:</I> 1) sheltering, through
advising people to remain indoors and close their doors and
windows, usually for less than a day; 2) evacuation, the urgent
removal of people from a specified area for periods on the order
of days; and 3) prophylactic administration of iodine, if high
intakes of radioactive iodine have occurred or are expected to
occur. 

<P>
<I>For later phases of the response:</I> 1) temporary relocation
of people to a new habitat, usually for no longer than one to two
years; 2) permanent resettlement of people in new or existing
settlements for the foreseeable future; and 3) control of food
and water contaminated in excess of specified levels.
<P>
<H3>Principles and levels of intervention</H3>
<P>
Three principles have been agreed upon by the international
community as a general basis for intervention. They may be
paraphrased as follows: 1) Intervention to avoid serious prompt
health effects should be carried out as a first priority. 2)
Protective actions to avoid delayed health effects should be
initiated when they will produce more good than harm in the
affected population; and 3) These actions should be introduced 
and withdrawn at levels that produce a maximum net benefit to the
population.
<P>
The first principle is critical for response to an accident
producing any high doses. It means that any immediate threat to
individuals should be countered through evacuation (or, rarely,
sheltering) (and, when appropriate, iodine prophylaxis) as a
first priority, and carried out to the maximum extent of
immediately available resources. There may be rare cases when
evacuation to satisfy this first principle is not appropriate
because it could cause greater harm (e.g. moving people on life
support systems, or in the face of a competing disaster). 
<P>
Intervention levels for minimizing delayed health effects are
based on the second and third principles. In applying these
principles, the terms good,harm, and benefit include - in
addition to health and safety and the tangible costs of
protective actions - unquantifiable factors such as reassurance,
stress, and attention to societal values. These are not within
the primary professional competence of the radiation protection
expert. They are more appropriately the responsibility of the
decision-maker. He or she may choose to consider these factors,
in addition to those addressed by this radiation protection
advice, in arriving at decisions that will produce the maximum
benefit in the affected population.
<P>
Furthermore, the second and third principles address only the
risk of delayed effects in the population as a whole. This means
that they do not explicitly limit individual risks. A
significantly higher than normal risk of delayed effects to even
a few individuals may be an important factor in national
decision-making. For this reason authorities may choose an action
level to avoid unacceptably high individual risks. Whether
intervention at such a level is always possible will depend on
the accident's severity and nature and the resources at the
disposal of the country. Such action levels were not considered
in deriving the generic intervention levels in <I>Safety Series
No. 109</I> and may lead to lower values for intervention,
particularly in the case of protective actions for later phases
of a response.
<P>
<B><I>Protective Actions for Early, or
Urgent, Response.</I></B>
These actions must be applied promptly in order to be effective.
Delays may lead to population doses that could have been avoided
and in the worst cases could lead to prompt health effects. Rapid
decisions are difficult because there is usually very limited
early information about an accident and large uncertainty about
its consequences. For this reason pre-planning should be carried
out wherever possible so that decisions can be made rapidly based
on facility conditions and pre-arranged patterns for response,
rather than just on measurements carried out and actions 
hastily organized during the early course of an accident. In the
case of fixed facilities with well-understood characteristics,
response plans should prescribe action to implement urgent
protective actions on the basis of facility conditions, rather
than rely on confirmation of an actual release through
measurements at the facility or offsite, whenever it is
reasonably feasible to do so.
<P>
<B>Sheltering</B> means staying in buildings to reduce exposure
to airborne contamination and  surface deposits, and closing
doors and windows and turning off ventilation systems to reduce
inhalation of radioactive material from outside air. Sheltering
can also facilitate staging for evacuation and the prophylactic
use of iodine. Because of the small penalties, sheltering may be
justified at low dose levels. However, its effectiveness
decreases rapidly with time for most structures (typically
reducing doses to airborne particulates by a factor of 
two or three in a few hours) and is low for lightweight
structures or those with high air exchange rates. Further, there
is a limit to the time that populations can remain indoors
without undesirable complications.
<P>
The generic intervention level for sheltering is 10 mSv. This
value was selected based on the maximum anticipated period of
sheltering (2 days). Sheltering may be advised at lower levels
for shorter periods or to facilitate other protective actions.
<P>
Sheltering can be effective if the exposure is of short duration
and buildings are of dense structure and well sealed, as in some
northern countries. In many warm countries, however, most houses
are made of light materials, and people cannot stay indoors in
sealed houses for long periods. These factors must be considered
when choosing between protective action through sheltering versus
evacuation.
<P>
<B>Evacuation</B> is the urgent moving of people from their
normal 
housing for a limited period of time. Its use should be based on
the dose that can be avoided by evacuation and would not be
avoided by sheltering. The generic intervention level for
evacuation is 50 mSv. This value has been selected based on the
maximum anticipated period of evacuation (7 days). Evacuation may
be initiated at lower levels for shorter periods or when it can
be carried out easily, e.g. for small groups of people. Under
exceptional circumstances (such as hazardous weather, or the
presence of a competing disaster) or where evacuation would be
unusually difficult (for very large populations or in the 
absence of adequate transportation) initiation of prompt
evacuation may be deferred to a higher intervention level.
<P>
In cases before an actual release has started, and where
projected doses exceeding this level  have a relatively high
probability of occurrence, preventive evacuation normally will be
advisable. Evacuation as a protective action is commonly used
when people are threatened by other man-made hazards (e.g., fire
or chemical spills) or by forces of nature (e.g., hurricanes,
tornados, earthquakes, or floods). In most cases people return in
a short period, typically one to two days, if their homes do not
require prolonged clean-up. Because of the short time involved,
primitive accommodation in schools or other public buildings is
typical.
<P>
<B>Prophylactic use of iodine</B> is the administration of stable
(non-radioactive) iodine in order to block the uptake of
radioiodine by the thyroid. It must be carried out promptly to be
effective (ideally several hours before and no later than a few
hours following exposure). For this reason this protective
measure is most commonly practical only when emergency planning
has included predistribution of stable iodine to the population
at risk. It will usually be coupled with evacuation or
sheltering. The generic intervention level for prophylactic 
use of iodine is 100 mGy. This level applies to the dose to the 
thyroid that would bereceived from intake of radioiodine. 
Since there may be complications depending on local diet and
other factors, public health authorities should be involved in
implementing this measure.
<P>
<B><I>Protective Actions for Later Phases of a Response.</I></B>
Sheltering and evacuation are short-term protective measures. If
measurements confirm that doses warrant further action, temporary
relocation or permanent resettlement, and control of food and
water may be necessary.
<P>
For early protective actions, the greatest benefit is likely to
accrue if action is taken with minimal delay, based on rough
predictions of how the accident will develop. For long-term
protective actions, there will usually be a rather small
radiological health penalty for delaying to obtain accurate
measurements for projecting doses. Moreover, the social and
economic penalties for imprudent decisions can be high, 
owing to the long period protective actions may be in effect. It
is important that a decision to implement these protective
actions is carried out in as informed a manner as possible, using
best estimates for the consequences of different options.
<P>
<B>Temporary relocation</B> means the organized removal of people
for an extended but limited period of time (e.g., several months)
to avoid doses from radioactive material deposited on the ground,
including resuspended materials, and in some cases from local
food or water. People typically would be housed in temporary
accommodation of a reasonable minimum standard of comfort and
privacy. The generic intervention levels for initiating and
terminating temporary relocation are 30 mSv in a month and 10 mSv
in a month, respectively; i.e., people should be temporarily
relocated if the dose avertable over the next month is expected
to be greater than 30 mSv. They may return when the avertable 
dose falls below 10 mSv in a month. However, if the dose
accumulated in a month is not expected to fall below this level
within a period of a year or two, the population should be
permanently resettled. Two levels are specified because there are
relatively high penalties for initiating relocation compared to
maintaining it. It is also necessary to specify the period of
time it is reasonable to live in temporary housing.
<P>
<B>Permanent resettlement</B> means complete removal of people 
from the area with no expectation of return for at least several
years. People typically would be resettled in accommodations
comparable to those vacated. This may involve construction of new
housing and infrastructure. The generic intervention levels for
permanent resettlement are 1 Sv in a lifetime or a dose exceeding
10 mSv per month that persists beyond one or two years (i.e.,
that does not permit return from temporary relocation within one
or two years). It should be recognized that projected doses below
the intervention levels for evacuation or for terminating
temporary relocation could also, over a lifetime, become high
enough (i..e., exceed 1 Sv) to warrant permanent resettlement.
<P>
<B>Control of food and water</B> may have to be considered under
three 
different circumstances: where alternative supplies are
available; where alternative supplies are scarce; and for
distribution in international trade. Generic action levels have
been established for use by national authorities when alternative
supplies of food are available. <I>(<A HREF="urgent.html">See
table.</A>)</I> The values
depend upon the type of foodstuff and the type of contaminating
radionuclide. The radionuclides in question are those 
most likely to be of concern in foods following an accident.
<P>
In situations where extensive restrictions on food supplies
could result in nutritional deficiencies or, in the extreme,
starvation, case-by-case evaluations will be required. In most
such situations relocation will be indicated, and alternative
food made available. However, when this is  not possible, the
radiation hazard must be considered realistically in comparison
to competing health hazards, and higher action levels should
invariably be adopted.
<P>
Following any event that may contaminate foodstuffs, a variety of
countermeasures may be instituted at various stages in production
and marketing. These should be implemented to ensure that, to the
maximum extent practicable, foodstuffs are maintained below the
action levels. The generic action levels for foodstuffs will also
satisfy the requirements for distribution of foodstuffs in
international trade for consumption in countries unaffected by an
accident.

Despite major advances and "revolutions" in agricultural
production, many countries still face enormous obstacles in
meeting their current demand for food. In Africa for example,
projected demand will require a tripling of the current
agricultural output in the next 30 years. A country's capacity to
produce surplus food remains a basic distinction between
developed and developing countries. As the scramble for control
of global resources intensifies, the gap grows wider.
<P>
How will the developing world's farmers meet these staggering
requirements for more food? What improvements in agricultural
systems will permit doubling let alone a tripling of output?
<P>
These increases will only occur if agricultural resources are
expanded or more productive resources become available in
agricultural systems. Such "resources" include land, water, the
human knowledge base, technology and institutional support. The
food and agricultural programme of the IAEA is operated jointly
with FAO to assist Member States in using nuclear techniques to
improve both the <I>quality</I> and <I>quantity</I> of
agricultural resources. The availability of agricultural land and
water are being expanded through environmentally sustainable
approaches that include SIT technology to biologically eradicate
pests like the Tsetse fly that severely limits animal production
across vast areas of Africa; and isotopic techniques to study
irrigation and ground water dynamics. The quality of agricultural
resources is being enhanced through the introduction of more
productive technologies: mutation breeding is a technique to
create new plant characteristics such as drought resistance or
higher yield. Improved farming practices such as the use of
rhizobia to inoculate crops and improve soil fertility is an
environmentally safe and economical alternative to conventional
fertilizers. Soil moisture and nutrient management are fostered
by agro-chemical techniques that improve crop yield and food
quality. In the areas of animal production and health, nuclear
techniques have unlocked many secrets of the biological processes
responsible for growth, health and reproduction of farm animals.
The growing importance of food preservation techniques such as
irradiation is reinforced by the loss of one quarter of world's
food production after harvest. 
<P>
The IAEA's Technical Co-operation activities in agriculture play
a small but increasingly catalytic role in sustainable
agricultural development. This edition of <I>Inside TC</I> 
illustrates how a new partnership is being forged between
scientists and development managers to empower farmers through a
variety of specialized techniques, improved practices and
agricultural knowledge systems.

Selecting sustainable options</H2>
<P>
<I>At an international symposium on comparative energy
assessment, experts reviewed key issues facing
decision-makers</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author">by Leonard Bennett and Malik
Derrough</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Demand for energy, and notably electrical energy, will grow
significantly, especially in developing countries, as the world's
population increases. Which energy options are selected will
significantly affect the world's achievement of sustainable
social, economic, and environmental development.
<P>
In many countries, energy planners and decision-makers are facing
difficult questions about their nation's energy futures, and they
must assess a number of options and energy strategies taking many
factors into account. Many of the major issues were addressed at
an international symposium convened in Vienna by the IAEA and
nine other international organizations in late 1995. <I>(<A
HREF="about.html">See
box</A>.)</I>
<P> 
In opening the symposium, IAEA Director General Hans Blix
surveyed the overall global energy scene. He noted that fossil
fuels are expected to continue to dominate global energy supply,
with solar power, wind power, biomass and other renewables
projected to play valuable yet minor roles. Nuclear power's
contribution, which now stands at about 7% of the world's
commercial energy and 17% of its electricity, is projected to
remain significant. 
<P>
He further pointed out some of the complexities facing today's
energy planners and decision-makers, particularly in the
electricity sector. They must take into account a range of
factors related to the entire fuel cycle of the energy source  
- including their technical and economic performance and their
impact on health and the environment. While costs remain a key
factor, they must be measured in many comparative ways - 
including assessing the costs for those countries suffering from
a chronic  <I>under-supply</I> of electricity. 
<P>
The types of analysis now required, he said, require the design 
of approaches that incorporate all relevant elements into a
comprehensive comparative assessment of different options and
strategies, and to develop enhanced databases, analytical
methodologies, and other decision-aiding tools upon which policy
makers can rely to support their decisions. International
organizations have an important role to play in helping to meet
these challenges, he pointed out.
<P>
As part of its efforts to assist national energy authorities in
analyzing and planning their energy and electricity systems, the
IAEA is conducting a programme covering comparative assessment
and methodologies that will objectively support decision-making
processes. This article reviews efforts in the context of the
major electricity and related issues addressed at the 1995
international symposium. It includes highlights of keynote
addresses and selected major points addressed during six
technical sessions.
<P>
<H3>Highlights from keynote addresses</H3>
<P>
<B><I>Dr. E. Andreta, European Commission.</I></B> He stressed
the importance of understanding the linkages between electricity,
environment, and the economy (the E3 linkages). The relationships

are very complex, and it is not possible to manage the whole
electricity system without very reliable and efficient
technologies, on one side, and without comprehensive management
and planning tools on the other side. The EC has developed a
large set of energy models for  planning sustainable development
of energy and electricity supplies. The databases and models
developed within the inter-agency DECADES project initiated by
the IAEA are another positive contribution, one that points out
the necessity of global co-operation in this field. <I>(<A
HREF="decades.html">See
box</A>.)</I>
<P>
<B><I>Dr. R. Stern, World Bank.</I></B> Primary energy
consumption in developing countries is expected to equal that in
OECD countries by the year 2000, and by the year 2030 to be 2.5
times greater than OECD consumption. The World Bank estimates
that the investment needs of the electric power sector alone will
be of the order of US $150 billion per year. Financing this
investment will require a mix of national resources and
international capital. The World Bank recognizes that the
appropriate mix of policy mechanisms and technology choices will
depend on the situation of each country, its resource endowment,
and the inevitable trade-offs required to achieve economic and
environmental objectives.
<P>
For many countries, natural gas is a very attractive fuel. The
difficulty is that gas is not always available where it is
needed; hence, gas trade via pipelines or as liquefied natural
gas (LNG) is essential. This will require large investments, a
great deal of international co-operation, and a long time for
development. Dr. Stern noted that the burning of natural gas
produces relatively low amounts of CO<SUB>2</SUB> compared to the
burning of coal. However, the greenhouse gas effect of unburned
natural gas (methane) is some 30 times greater than that of
CO<SUB>2</SUB>; therefore, roughly a 5% leakage rate in a gas
pipeline would negate the benefits in CO<SUB>2</SUB> abatement
achieved by substituting gas for coal in a power plant.
<P>
<B><I>Ms. J. Aloisi de Larderel, Industry and Environment
Department of the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP).</I></B> While electricity is available to virtually 100%
of the population in industrialized countries, an estimated 2
billion people in developing countries have no access to
electricity. Thus, there is still a huge potential for
electrification in developing countries. Electricity provides the
possibility of clean and efficient energy use in households,
transport, and industry. However, the massive provision of
electricity to growing populations with increasing standards of
living and expanding industries introduces the risk of
potentially serious environmental impacts. Therefore, UNEP's
primary role in the area of energy is to foster environmental
awareness and to encourage greater incorporation of environmental
issues into energy planning and policy.
<P>
<B><I>Dr. A. Tcheknavorian-Asenbauer, United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO).</I></B> UNIDO estimates that
the industrialization process in developing countries - where 60%
of the world's projected population growth will take place  -
will require a tripling of energy supplies by the year 2025. 
<P>
Cost-effective improvements in the existing equipment using
energy, and the application of good housekeeping measures in
industries can result in efficiency gains of up to 40%, and this
can be achieved with small to moderate investments. Process
improvements, although much more capital intensive, can achieve
energy savings of more than 50%. Thus, decision makers need to
examine all available options for energy conservation and
efficiency in terms of their potential for helping to meet the
country's economic and environmental goals.
<P>
New and renewable energies, such as solar power, biomass, and
small hydropower should be examined as options for decentralized
supply of electricity to rural areas, which, due to the low
population density, are expensive to supply from the central
grid. Dr. Tcheknavorian stressed the important role that biomass,
particularly wood, represents as an energy resource for rural
populations and also for local industries. She noted that biomass
provides over 50% of the industrial energy in Africa. However,
the use of biomass is often associated with inefficient
conversion processes and the collection of fuel wood can lead to
deforestation.
<P>
Also, industrialized countries should assist developing ones by
transferring technologies that are well adapted to the needs and
situations in developing countries. In order to assess and
compare various energy systems, decision makers need to define
technology transfer as a strategic component of an energy
programme. Thus, the extent to which various technologies can be
absorbed, and the time and cost needed for that process, need to
be examined. Finally, the main lesson that UNIDO has learned
through its experience in developing countries is that, in order
to contribute to sustainable socio-economic development,
decisions on energy systems must take into account the specific
situation in the country in which they will be implemented. 
<P>
<B><I>Dr. L. Olsson, World Meteorological Organization
(WMO).</B></I> In presenting a keynote address on behalf of Prof.
Obasi, Secretary General of WMO, he reviewed issues related to
energy and climate change. Production and use of energy has a
complex impact on the environment, including an impact on
climate, and the need for energy is normally directly related to
climate and weather. Also, many energy-related activities, e.g.
production of energy from biomass, hydropower, and other
renewable sources, are based on resources that are extremely
sensitive to climate. Global  concern over potential climate
change has increased the need for environmental impact
assessments. In order to ensure a fair judgement of various
energy systems, it is of utmost importance to make available
relevant information, and it is essential to take a non-biased
attitude in assessing scientific, technological, and
socio-economic development. The DECADES project is making an
important contribution towards this objective. 
<P>
<H3>Highlights of technical sessions</H3>
<P>
<B><I>Session 1: Key Issues in the Decision-making
Process.</I></B> Chaired by Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, Director of
the Tata Energy Research Institute in India, the session focused
on the wide range of issues of concern to decision makers in
various regions. Papers illustrated that there may be greatly
different priorities according to the level of social, economic,
and industrial development in a given country. Presentations
included those by Dr. K. Leydon, of the EC; Dr. H. Khatib,
speaking on behalf of the World Energy Council's Committee on
Energy Issues in Developing Countries; Mr. L. D. Ryabev and Mr.
Y.F. Chernilyn of Russia; Ms. J. Ellis and Mr. S. Peake of the
International Energy Agency of the OECD; and Mr. R. Lanari,
Canada. A number of important points were addressed.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Member countries of the European Union are dependent on
imports for 50% or more of their energy, and this likely will
rise to about 70%, Dr. Leydon noted. The challenge to any
economist is how to meet the environmental goals and, at the same
time, avoid raising the cost of energy as a factor in production.
He stressed that it will be no easy task in an evolving
geopolitical situation to develop new energy services in response
to changing needs; to harness energy efficiency; and to develop
new technologies and products. The decision-making framework has
to properly reflect the complexity of the choices to be made.
<P>
<LI>Developing countries, particularly those in the low income
category, are concerned about cost more than anything else, Dr.
Khatib said. Therefore, they try to utilize available local
fuels, irrespective of their quality, whenever possible. Also,
priority is given to technologies requiring low investment, which
may lead to the use of local technologies having less efficiency
than state-of-the-art technologies. In most instances, these
countries cannot afford the extra investment to install pollution
abatement systems. However, developing countries are becoming
increasingly concerned with environmental questions, and they are
trying to reduce pollution, in particular where it is causing
local impacts.
<P>
<LI>The two largest developing countries, China and India, have
populations of 1175 million and 900 million, respectively; a
combined population of 2075 million which is almost half the
total of all developing countries, Dr. Khatib noted. The growth
potential of electricity supply in both countries is very high,
and both have large coal reserves. Therefore, both countries will
continue to depend on coal as their major fuel for electricity
generation for decades to come. Indeed, all developing countries
with reasonable levels of commercially viable coal reserves will
favour coal as their main fuel for electricity generation. To
minimize the environmental consequences of more coal burning,
clean coal technologies need to be promoted in developing
countries.
<P>
<LI>Electricity's share in OECD energy use is expected to
increase from 18% to over 21% by the year 2010. Electricity is an
important source of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions in the OECD,
accounting
for 33% of total energy-related CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions in 1993.
Thus, in spite of the commitments taken in relation to the
Framework Convention on Climate Change, total emissions from
electricity production in OECD countries are expected to grow,
since electricity demand is projected to increase by some 2.1%
per annum up to 2010. However, the emissions will depend on the
fuel mix, which differs greatly among OECD countries at present.
Norway, for example, currently generates 99% of its electricity
from renewable energies; Denmark uses coal for 87% of its
electricity and the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and
Germany also rely on coal for the majority of their electricity
generation. France, on the other hand, relies on nuclear power
for some 75% of its electricity supply, while Italy generates the
majority of its electricity from oil.
<P>
<LI>In Canada, indigenous populations are being involved in the
planning of a hydro-electric project. Through a process of
intensive consultation with the indigenous Inuit populations, it
was possible to identify a number of measures that could help to
meet their concerns about potential impacts of the project. Also,
the consultative process gave community members a measure of
confidence and a feeling of control over the project, which they
otherwise would not have felt. This process showed the importance
of involving interested and affected parties as active
participants in the decision-making process, and not merely as
passive spectators.
<P>
<B><I>Session 2: Assessment of Health and Environmental
Impacts.</I></B> Chaired by Prof. Mohan Munasinghe from Sri
Lanka, this session examined the ongoing development of tools for
assessing health and environmental impacts of energy chains for
electricity generation. Presentations included those by Prof. B.
S&oslash;rensen of Denmark; Prof. A. Markandya, Harvard
University, United States; Dr. N. Pop-Jordanova, Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia; Ms. D. Lin, China; Ms. N.P. Villela,
Brazil; and Dr. S. Morris, World Health Organization
Collaborating Centre on Health and Environmental Effects of
Energy Systems, Brookhaven National Laboratory, United States.
Major points were made on various issues.
<P>
<LI>Several papers stressed the continuing need to improve
databases and analytical tools so that uncertainties in data and
results can be reduced. Putting monetary values on health impacts
from energy systems is a difficult task and many problems still
must be resolved. However, the monetary valuation of impacts can
assist in the decision-making process, both in the selection of
fuels and technologies and in the location of power plants. 
<P>
<LI>The standard approach of analyzing direct health effects
caused by exposure to physical and chemical agents should be
extended to include consideration of psychological effects (e.g.
stress, anxiety, fear), Dr. Pop-Jordanova suggested. Her research
showed there is a great difference between the real and perceived
health effects from energy systems. Objective and transparent
information from comparative assessments could help to reduce
this difference. 
<P>
<LI>All energy technologies involve some degree of health risk.
Dr. Morris noted that despite many studies on the relative health
effects of different methods of generating electricity, the
results do not appear to have affected actual investment choices.
However, due to the increasing public concern about health and
environmental aspects of power generation, it may be expected
that such studies would have a greater influence on future
decisions. It is thus important that the comparative assessment
approaches are capable of providing decision-makers with
scientifically correct and understandable information. 
<P>
<LI>Scientists and analysts still have a long way to go in order
to provide the type of comprehensive information that is needed
by decision-makers, Prof. Munasinghe stressed in his concluding
remarks. More has to be done in investigating comprehensively
transboundary and global issues such as greenhouse gas emissions
and impacts; assessing long-term effects that might arise from
chemical and radioactive waste disposal for example; and
exploring all potential impact pathways. The uncertainties that
still prevail in data and in results from modelling studies make
it impossible to give definitive answers to all questions. Thus,
there is a need for more co-operation and exchange between
analysts and decision-makers to transfer adequate information and
useful results from analytical studies to those responsible for
policy making.
<P>
<B><I>Session 3: Integrated Frameworks for Comparative
Assessment.</I></B> Chaired by Mr. Kurt Yeager, Electric Power
Research Institute, United States, this session included
presentations by Prof. P. Capros of Greece; Mr. N.J. Eyre and Ms.
J.E. Berry on the ExternE Project of the EC and the US Department
of Energy; Prof. M. Munasinghe of Sri Lanka; Dr. S. Hirschberg of
the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland; Dr. Y. Uchiyama,
Central Research Institute of the Electric Power Industry, Japan;
Dr. I.F. Vladu of the IAEA; Prof. M. Chadwick, Stockholm
Environment Institute, Sweden; and Dr. R. Wilson, Harvard
University, United States. Selected highlights are featured here.
<P>
<LI>The ExternE project has shown that it is difficult to achieve
full comparability between different fuel cycles, since each one
has unique impacts and the assumptions adopted in the
quantification can affect their comparison. Some fuel cycles have
very long-term impacts, notably global warming impacts from
fossil fuel cycles and the radiological impacts of long-lived
isotopes from the nuclear fuel cycle. Both the monetary values
and the methodology for weighting the distribution of risks to
the population and over time and space remain controversial,
which adds to uncertainty. Despite some unresolved issues, the
study has made important advances in: evaluating damages over
very long time and space scales; reporting them in a consistent
manner for different energy cycles; identifying the remaining
uncertainties; and highlighting important parameters in the
decision-making process.
<P>
<LI>A life-cycle analysis of electricity generation chains in
Switzerland showed that nuclear power emits some 100 times less
greenhouse gases than hard coal chains and 10 times less than
solar systems. For fuel cycles other than fossil, the power plant
contributes only a minor amount to greenhouse gas emissions,
while the other steps of the chain are responsible for the major
share of emissions, owing to energy consumption and material
production in these steps. In the Swiss context, expected
technological improvements will reduce greenhouse gas emissions
by some 30% for the coal-fired and nuclear systems; and by a
factor of five for solar systems with the introduction of
amorphous silicon panels.
<P>
<LI>A life-cycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from
electricity generation and supply systems in Japan found that
coal, oil, and gas systems emit respectively some 270, 190, and
180 grams of carbon per kWh of electricity generated. On the
other side, hydropower, nuclear power, and solar photovoltaic
power emit respectively some 5, 6, and 35 grams of carbon per
kWh. Technological improvements are expected to reduce
significantly the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity
systems. Combined cycle gas turbine plants fuelled with liquefied
natural gas (LNG) will emit 140 grams of carbon per kWh as
compared to 180 grams per kWh with currently used natural gas
fired plants. The progress is expected to be even more
significant for nuclear power and photovoltaic systems. Advanced
nuclear reactors with a closed fuel cycle will emit some 2 to 3
grams of carbon per kWh (versus 6 grams per kWh with current
nuclear technology) and photovoltaic systems using amorphous
silicon cells will emit 8 grams of carbon per kWh (versus 35
grams per kWh with photovoltaic power plants now in operation).
<P>
<LI>All approaches to environmental risk assessment have
difficulties in regard to quantitative estimation; not only are
the environmental effects not readily quantified but there is no
general agreement on what should be quantified, Prof. Chadwick
noted. A number of methods have been proposed in order to
overcome this problem and a number of possible approaches have
been taken to comparative environmental risk assessment. However,
more work needs to be done to reach some level of agreement on
the approach which is most useful in the decision-making process,
and he recommended that this could be a fruitful area of work for
the next phase of the DECADES project.
<P>
<LI>Four issues dominate public concerns about energy sources,
although the magnitude of the risk of each is controversial,
either because the experts do not agree or the public does not
trust the experts, in the view of Dr. Wilson. The four are the
probability and effect of a severe nuclear power accident; the
health impact of particulate air pollution; the global climate
effect of increased CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from burning fossil
fuels; and wastes from the nuclear fuel cycle. Dr. Wilson
stressed that severe accidents can and do happen in energy
systems, and that overall nuclear power's safety record is
excellent. The effects of fossil fuel use on public health are
primarily those of air pollution, especially from emissions of
very small particles and sulphates. He noted that many studies
show that it seems likely that CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations in
the
earth's atmosphere will rise to two or three times the historical
levels within the next century. Although there remains
considerable controversy about what the effects will be, it
generally is agreed that we are making a large change in an
important climate parameter (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) which could affect
the
entire earth. Nuclear power, whose CO<SUB>2</SUB> impact is
negligible, has the potential to replace at least a significant
share of fossil fuels for electricity generation. 
<P>
With regard to wastes from energy systems, Dr. Wilson noted that
many experts are of the opinion that nuclear power is the only
energy system for which society has any idea of a sensible
long-term solution. Coal wastes are not perceived by the public
as a major problem, yet these wastes contain radioactive
materials with half lives comparable to long-lived nuclear
wastes. Furthermore, the volume or weight of wastes from coal
production and burning dwarfs that from the nuclear fuel cycle.
In the United States, for example, about 800 million tons of coal
are mined in the country each year, producing some 120 million
tons of ashes and 20 million tons of sulphur compounds when it is
burned for electricity generation.
<P>
<B><I>Session 4: Implementation of Comparative
Assessment.</I></B> Chaired by Prof. Zhou Dadi of China, this
session included presentations by Mr. L. Bennett et. al. of the
IAEA; Prof. T. Lefevre, Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP); Mr. T. Herberg and Mr. U. Fritsche,
Germany; Mr. M. Amann, International Institute for Applied
Systems Analysis (IIASA); Mr. R.. Campo, Colombia; and Dr. C.
Heaps  et. al., Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)-Boston
Centre, United States. 
<P>
<LI>Results were reported from some 20 comparative assessment
case studies sponsored by the IAEA as part of the DECADES
project. The studies sought to identify electricity generation
strategies that would meet the objectives of environmental
protection, in particular reduction of atmospheric emissions at
acceptable cost. Overall results showed that significant
reductions of emissions and other environmental burdens can be
obtained by improving the efficiency of existing facilities at
different levels of the energy chains, including the fuel
conversion and transportation steps. The rehabilitation of
existing power plants, in particular by adding pollution control
technologies, is often a cost-effective measure for mitigating
environmental impacts. Improving the overall efficiency of energy
systems by promoting co-generation is identified as a very
cost-effective option in many countries, especially where heat
distribution networks already exist for district heating.
<P>
In those studies where it was considered, nuclear power appeared
to be cost effective for reducing emissions of SO<SUB>2</SUB>,
NO<SUB>x</SUB> and CO<SUB>2</SUB>. For example, some studies
showed
that, although CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission reduction targets could be
achieved without nuclear power, its use would lead to
significantly lower costs. In general, the studies showed that
the possibilities for CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission reduction in the
electric power sector would be very limited without the use of
nuclear power.
<P>
<LI>ESCAP has carried out Energy Environmental Planning (EEP)
case studies in the framework of the Programme for Asian
Co-operation on Energy and the Environment. Prof. Lefevre
stressed that, although sustainable development now is widely
embraced as a key societal goal, it is clear that the
specification of sustainable policies for the energy sector is a
complex task that poses serious dilemmas for many Asian
countries. Developing countries of Asia are striving to increase
energy production and/or imports to keep up with desired energy
consumption. Because the countries are developing rapidly and
energy production capacity must be added quickly, emphasis has
been placed on minimizing capital costs, with relatively little
concern for environmental consequences. However, these countries
increasingly are feeling pressure, from multilateral lenders and
donor countries, to pay more attention to the environment and to
sustainable development. Also, as many of the countries have
become more prosperous, their citizens are becoming less willing
to sacrifice environmental quality (including public health) for
cheap energy. As a consequence, the countries are seeking
technical and scientific information, as well as state-of-the-art
methodologies and tools for energy-environmental analysis to help
them make informed decisions about their energy development
strategies. 
<P>
<LI>Under the SEI/UNEP Fuel Chain Project, two countries
(Venezuela and Sri Lanka) have  used the project's software and
database to examine fuel and technology options across a range of
fuels and energy sectors. The two case studies showed that fuel
chain analysis can be useful in highlighting trade-offs between
local and global environmental impacts. For example in Venezuela,
the analysis found that while compressed natural gas (CNG) would
be favoured over diesel in terms of local air pollution resulting
from the power plant, the use of CNG could result in higher
global emissions of greenhouse gases.
<P>
<B><I>Session 5: Implementation of Comparative Assessment:
Country Case Studies.</I></B> Chaired by Dr. Cesar
Cordoba-Salazar of Colombia, this session included presentations
by Dr. T. Larsson <I>et. al</I>., Sweden; Dr. A. Khan <I>et.
al</I>., Pakistan; Dr. A. Popescu <I>et.al</I>., Romania; Dr. A.
Das, India; Dr. M. Vielle, France; Dr. J. Geidl and Dr. S.
Kanhouwa, United States; and Ms. S. Messner, IIASA in Austria.
<P>
<LI>Studies in Sweden have compared the effect on CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions from three different policies on energy taxes and
subsidies. The main differences were between the tax systems
introduced in 1990 and 1994, as well as some difference in the
policies on subsidies for the energy sector. The results showed
that the 1994 changes in energy policy would lead to
CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions being reduced in 2005 to 20% below what they would have
been if the 1990 policy were still in use. However, beyond 2005,
i.e. from the start of the planned nuclear phase-out and beyond,
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions will rise drastically regardless of
which
policy (1990 or 1994) would be in effect.
<P>
<LI>In Pakistan, a study carried out under the DECADES project
involved two possible paths of development of electricity
generation, one that envisaged a reasonable growth in nuclear
power capacity and the other postulating a moratorium. The two
cases were compared in terms of their associated emissions of
pollutants such as SO<SUB>2</SUB>, NO<SUB>x</SUB>,
CO<SUB>2</SUB>, methane, radioisotopes, taking
into account the full energy chain of each supply option. The
study showed that the increased use of nuclear power in Pakistan
would not only be cost effective but also would be helpful in
reducing environmental impacts from electricity generation in the
country.
<P>
<LI>In Romania, a comparative assessment of alternative
electricity supply strategies showed that the least-cost plan for
expansion of the electricity generation system would use combined
cycle natural gas-fired power plants. The case with expanded use
of nuclear power showed total costs (up to 2015) that were some
2.6% higher than the least-cost plan; however, the use of nuclear
power would allow emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and NO<SUB>x</SUB>
to be
reduced by 70% and 80%, respectively, up to 2015, relative to the
least-cost case.
<P>
<LI>In India, a study examined different CO<SUB>2</SUB>-abatement
measures, such as accelerated development of hydropower,
increased use of renewable energies, and increased use of clean
coal technologies. The power sector is the single largest
contributor of CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions in India, and electricity
demand is expected to grow at 6% to 7% per year. If the current
domination of coal in electricity generation continues, then
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from the electricity sector would triple
by
the years 2011-2012. The study showed that the lowest cost
strategy involved the accelerated development of hydropower. It
would not only lead to lower costs but also would reduce
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions in 2011/2012 by some 12%. The study also
examined an  abatement scenario  which assumed a 25% reduction of
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions up to 2011/2012. This scenario included
both
the accelerated development of hydro and the introduction of
clean coal technologies. Results showed that this scenario would
be some 7% more costly than the business-as-usual scenario.
<P>
<LI>In France, a study examined nuclear power's economic and
environmental impacts. It found that if France had not developed
its nuclear power programme, the price of electricity would be
some 15% higher than what exists today, and would be highly
sensitive to fluctuations in the price of imported coal. Sulphur
dioxide emissions would be 18% higher that the current levels,
and other atmospheric emissions would be higher by an even
greater amount.
<P>
<LI>A IIASA research project is examining long-term options and
strategies for sustainable energy development, in particular by
assessing the potential for reducing energy use and the carbon
intensity of energy worldwide. The project has led to an
inventory of technologies for reducing CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions
and
the data's application in a number of studies. The database
contains information on over 1400 technologies, with more than
70% of the entries being for electricity generation and
cogeneration technologies. 
<P>
<B><I>Session 6: Comparative Assessment in Decision
Making.</I></B> Chaired by Dr. Nengah Sudja of Indonesia, the
final technical session included presentations by Ms. B. Reuber
of Canada; Prof. R. Dutkiewicz, South Africa; and Dr. D.
Martinsen and Dr. A. Voss <I>et. al</I>., Germany. A number of
important points were addressed.
<P>
<LI>In Canada, Ontario Hydro has included comparative assessment
as an integral part of its decision-making process. Externality
values (i.e. social costs, such as health effects, that are not
always fully reflected in the price of electricity) have been
established for Ontario's fossil-fired power stations and for the
full life-cycle of its nuclear power stations. Preliminary data
show that for the fossil power stations, the externality values
ranged from a low of 0.06 Canadian cents per kWh to a high of
1.66, with an average of 0.40. For nuclear stations, the
estimated externality costs ranged from a low of 0.0015 to a high
of 0.12 cents per kWh..
<P>
<LI>A comprehensive study in Germany analyzed possible paths for
the future development of the national energy system, with the
objective of identifying strategies for reducing CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions by 30% up to the year 2005 and 50% up to the year 2020.
The possible role of nuclear power as a mitigation measure was
analyzed by four separate 50% CO<SUB>2</SUB> reduction scenarios,
including one with a build-up of nuclear capacity. The study
concluded that a 50% CO<SUB>2</SUB> reduction by the year 2020 is
feasible, and that it can be attained with technologies that are
already available or known to become available in the next 30
years. The 50% CO<SUB>2</SUB> reduction target could be achieved
without the use of nuclear energy as a carbon-free energy
carrier, although at considerable cost. The expanded use of
nuclear energy would allow the target to be reached with
significantly lower costs of energy supply. 
<P>
<H3>Future directions</H3>
<P>
The international symposium underscored the importance of
comparative assessments in support of decision-making in the
electricity sector. It further identified a number of areas where
greater global co-operation is needed to improve the base of
information and the analytical tools and methodologies for
conducting comparative studies.
<P>
Through its programmes and activities, the IAEA is continuing to
examine areas in which its expertise and support can best be
applied to assist national policy- and decision-makers in
objectively and comprehensively assessing their energy systems
and strategies.

<P>
In the decade after the United Nations Conference on the Human
Environment, held in Stockholm in 1972, the IAEA organized a
series of  international meetings with themes concerned with
radionuclides and their behaviour in the environment. In the
atmosphere of concern for the environment which followed the UN
Conference, the IAEA-sponsored meetings provided a focal point
for international discussion and served to summarize the state of
knowledge on radionuclide behaviour in different environmental
media. A considerable amount of research was, at that time, being
directed in IAEA Member States towards achieving an understanding
of the behaviour of radionuclides, and especially of long-lived
radionuclides, in the terrestrial and aquatic environments. The
last symposium in this sequence of meetings was held in
Knoxville, Tennessee, in the United States in 1981 with the
title,  The Environmental Migration of Long-Lived Radionuclides .
<P>
Today, there is a new and increasing concern for the environment
stemming from various evidences that the environment is being
seriously affected by the activities of human beings. We are all
aware of the effects of regional pollution and the possible
threats of global warming and ozone layer depletion. It was to
address these and other similar concerns that the UN held its
Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in
1992. In the context of radionuclides in the environment there
has also been a renewed interest; however, the stimulus in this
case has come from a different direction. The relaxation of
tensions between the countries of the east and the west has
allowed much previously classified information on matters related
to radioactive releases and their environmental impacts to become
available. It is this new source of environmental information,
together with the environmental information from the Chernobyl
accident, which has renewed interest and stimulated research on
radionuclides in the environment in recent years. In many cases,
the need to gain greater understanding of radionuclide behaviour
in the environment is linked to the plans for cleaning up the
environmental contamination which resulted from weapons
production operations and the early days of nuclear fuel cycle
development. 
<P>
It was with these developments in mind that the Agency organized
the <A HREF="#note">International Symposium on Environmental
Impact of Radionuclide Releases</A>, in Vienna in May 1995. A
total of 222 experts from 39 countries and five international
organizations participated. This article summarizes the
Symposium's highlights in selected topical areas that were
addressed.
<P>
<H3>Studies in the marine environment</H3>
<P>
Since the time it was revealed that high- and low-level
radioactive wastes had been dumped in the shallow waters of the
Kara Sea in the Arctic over a period of 30 years, many studies
have been initiated to evaluate the implications of the dumping.
Shortly after the revelations in late 1991 and 1992, the IAEA, in
collaboration with affected countries, launched an international
project aimed at assessing the current and possible future
impacts on health and the environment of the dumping. This
project, known as the International Arctic Seas Assessment
Project (IASAP), is still continuing but some preliminary results
were reported at the Symposium. Other presentations from Norway
and the Russian Federation and from the IAEA's Marine Environment
Laboratory (IAEA-MEL) described the investigatory cruises to the
affected area and associated experimental studies. The cruises
have succeeded in locating some of the dumped high level wastes
and measurements have been made <I>in situ</I> and also on
samples taken in the vicinity of the dumped objects ( submarines,
reactor compartments, waste containers). The studies have shown
that contamination can be detected close to some of the objects
but at distances greater than a few tens of meters little or
nothing can be detected. Since the wastes are located in a remote
and inhospitable region, it has been concluded that they pose no
threat to health or to the environment at the present time.
However, there remains concern about the possible hazards which
might result from leakage of radionuclides from the wastes at
some future time. This issue is being evaluated as part of the
IASAP together with an analysis of the feasibility of carrying
out remediation actions on the wastes.
<P>
The session on the marine environment also contained
presentations on the analysis of the impact of the discharges
from the Sellafield reprocessing plant in the United Kingdom, a
subject which has been controversial in recent years. The
presentations focused on the historical development of discharge
control at the site. They showed how discharges have been
dramatically reduced from the levels in the 1970s and early 1980s
by the introduction of effluent clean-up technology. At the same
time, methods for analyzing the environmental impact of the
discharges have also developed in sophistication and sensitivity.
<P>
<H3>Environmental model testing</H3>
<P>
The session on this subject was mainly focused on the IAEA
programme called VAMP (Validation of Environmental Model
Predictions) which ran from 1988 to 1994. The programme was aimed
at taking advantage of the widespread distribution of
radionuclides in the environment after the Chernobyl accident.
The results of the subsequent measuring and monitoring programmes
formed a basis for testing the predictions of mathematical
models. 
<P>
The VAMP programme proved to be very successful and involved well
over 100 scientists from many different countries. Several
presentations based around the results of the four VAMP working
groups (Terrestrial, Urban, Aquatic (Lakes and Rivers and
Reservoirs) and Multiple Pathways) were made at the Symposium.
The exercises in VAMP provided a unique opportunity for testing
the accuracy of model predictions. In some cases, existing models
and transfer coefficients were shown to give a reasonable
representation of the transfer of radionuclides through the
environment. In other cases, previous generic assumptions
regarding, for example, dietary intakes and food sources, were
shown to be inappropriate for application to a particular
environment. A general lesson from the studies is that each
environment is different to the extent that it is unlikely that
reliable predictions of radionuclide transfer to humans can be
made without a detailed knowledge of the characteristics of the
environment and of the habits of the exposed population group. In
the model testing studies, there was a general trend towards
over-prediction. One of the most likely reasons for this is
associated with the use to which models are normally put, that
is, they are most commonly used for the purpose of comparing
radiation doses received by critical population groups from
releases of radionuclides from operating practices with dose
limits. In this application, there is a need to be sure that
doses do not exceed the dose limit and so the assumptions and
parameter values in the models tend to be selected in a way which
will make underestimation unlikely.
<P>
Another feature of the VAMP programme, illustrated by
presentations at the Symposium, was the opportunity for reviewing
the state-of-the-art in modelling important transfer processes.
Expert reviews carried out in the course of the VAMP programme
have resulted in IAEA publications on the modelling of the
resuspension process (ground to air), the interception and
retention of radionuclides on plant surfaces, transfer in natural
ecosystems, and the effectiveness of food preparation methods for
the removal of radionuclide contaminants. 
<P>
<H3><A HREF="dose.html">Radiation dose reconstruction</A></H3>
<P>
Operations in the early years of nuclear weapons development were
directed at production targets and so the proper management of
radioactive and other wastes was not usually given a high
priority. Operational releases of radionuclides to the atmosphere
occurred at high levels from several of the nuclear weapons
production facilities. There were also releases to the
environment from accidents at some of the facilities and also as
a result of nuclear weapons testing. Information on these events
has become available in recent years as previously classified
documents have been released for public scrutiny. 
<P>
The concern of potentially affected population groups and, in
some cases, the legal action taken against the responsible
authorities, has prompted investigations of the radiation
exposures received by local populations as a result of the
releases. At the Symposium, presentations on  dose
reconstruction  themes were made in connection with the 1957
Khyshtym accident (Russian Federation) and with nuclear weapons
testing at Semipalatinsk (Kazakhstan), and the Nevada Test Site
(United States). The long time periods which have elapsed since
the releases occurred have created problems for radiological
assessment  detectives  to solve, and, for example, it has
necessitated the development of new environmental techniques for
estimating the doses received by exposed populations up to 40
years ago.
<P>
<H3>Environmental remediation</H3>
<P>
The historical problems discussed above have also created a
legacy of environmental contamination in many parts of the world.
In addition to the contamination of parts of the terrestrial and
aquatic environments created by weapons production and testing
activities, many countries are affected by the residues from
uranium and thorium mining operations, and from other non-nuclear
related mining activities. Contamination from the Chernobyl
accident still affects some countries, especially in forested and
upland areas. Research into cost-effective and environmentally
friendly solutions to these problems is going on in many
countries. Presentations at the Symposium included descriptions
of ameliorative techniques to be applied to soils, water,
vegetation and cattle. 
<P>
<H3>Topical discussion sessions</H3>
<P>
Discussion sessions were held on two topics which are currently
subjects of controversy and debate within the radioecological
community.
<P>
<B><I>Environmental Protection.</I></B> The generally accepted
position on this subject is that if human beings living in the
environment are adequately protected from ionizing radiations
then it can be assumed that other living species are also
adequately protected at the population level although not
necessarily at the individual level. This is the view currently
taken by the International Commission on Radiation Protection
(ICRP) and the position has been supported by an <A
HREF="#note_b">IAEA study published in 1992</A>. 
<P>
However, circumstances can be envisaged in which this assumption,
on its own, may be insufficient to guarantee protection of
non-human species, for example, where radionuclides are released
to an area where no humans are present.  There could also be
presentational reasons for wishing to have specific criteria for
protecting environmental species; the accepted ICRP approach
might be misunderstood and interpreted as an attitude of
unconcern for the environment.  Explicit criteria for protecting
non-human species might, therefore, be justified on these
grounds. On the other hand, the introduction of specific
environmental protection criteria could carry with it the
requirement for more environmental monitoring and assessment than
is currently practiced and, overall, it could involve substantial
extra costs for utilities and regulators.  These are some of the
points debated during the session on environmental protection and
it is clear that more discussions on the subject will take place
over the next few years. 
<P>
<B><I>The Precautionary Principle.</I></B> The principle of
precautionary action has appeared in various international
documents in recent years, notably in UNCED's Rio Declaration
(Agenda 21)and in some regional conventions on protection of the
marine environment. It is stated in various different ways; one
example, taken from the Convention on the Protection of the
Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea is as follows:  to take
preventive measures when there is reason to assume that
substances or energy introduced, directly or indirectly, into the
marine environment may create hazards to human health, harm
living resources and marine ecosystems, damage amenities or
interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea even when there
is no conclusive evidence of a causal relationship between inputs
and their alleged effects . 
<P>
The final part of the definition is obviously controversial and
it was the focal point of the discussion session on the
precautionary principle at the Symposium. On the one hand, it can
be argued that most present legislation on waste discharge can be
seen as unsatisfactory in that it requires scientists to prove
that there is an effect from a harmful substance in the
environment before regulatory measures will be introduced. The
precautionary approach would require a  reversal of the burden of
proof . Such a development could be useful in cases where little
is known about the substance that is planned to be discharged or
where the biogeochemical cycle and risks of the substance in the
environment are poorly understood. On the other hand, the
precautionary principle, if taken literally, could imply that no
discharges of substances to the environment should be allowed
since it is likely to be impossible to provide absolute proof
that no harm will occur. 
<P>
It is clear that while the precautionary approach is appropriate
as a general concept, it needs to be interpreted for application
to particular situations. It should be applied in ways which do
not prevent the controlled release of substances to the
environment whose properties are well known and whose behaviour
in the environment to which they are being released is well
understood.

<H2>International Centre for Theoretical Physics:
<BR>
A new institutional framework</H2>
<P>
<I>Under a new Tripartite Agreement, the IAEA, UNESCO, and Italy
strengthen their co-operative support of the research centre</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#edwin">by Edwin Nwogugu</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Over more than three decades, the International Centre for
Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy,  has blossomed
through the vision and energy of its creator, Professor Abdus
Salam, and his collaborators into a leading international centre
for research and training. Initially, the Centre's activities
were mainly in the areas of nuclear physics and nuclear data,
high energy physics, atomic physics, fusion physics and
mathematics. Over time, they extended to broad areas of physics
related to energy, solid state physics, environment, medicine,
biology, space science, lasers and mathematics, including
computer science in its various aspects. 
<P>
Today, under the stewardship of its new Director, Prof. Miguel
Angel Virasoro, the Centre continues to play a unique role as a
forum for the training of scientists from the Third World and as
a point of contact for the exchange of scientific expertise
between industrialized and developing countries. Thousands of
scientists study at the ICTP each year, participating in
workshops, seminars, training courses, and a range of other
scientific activities.
<P>
A number of important changes were recently made to the
organizational framework of the ICTP. These took effect 1 January
1996, when a Tripartite Agreement between the IAEA, the United
Nations Scientific, Cultural and Educational Organization
(UNESCO), and the Italian Government came into force. On the same
date, a new Joint Operation Agreement between the Agency and
UNESCO also took effect. These steps transfer the administrative
responsibility for the ICTP from the IAEA to UNESCO. This article
reviews the background and the changes to the organizational
framework of the Centre which were brought about by the two new
agreements.
<P>
<H3>Historical legal background </H3>
<P>
The IAEA's support of the ICTP goes back more than 30 years. In
1963, the Agency's Board of Governors, acting on the
recommendation of the General Conference, decided to establish at
Trieste an international centre for theoretical physics on a
provisional basis under IAEA auspices. Thereafter, the Agency
negotiated an agreement with the Italian Government - the
Agreement between the Agency and the Government of Italy
Concerning the Establishment of an International Centre for
Theoretical Physics at Trieste (INFCIRC/51) -  which was approved
by the Board in September 1963. This Agreement was to remain in
force for 4 years subject to extension by mutual agreement of the
parties.
<P>
Four years later, in 1967, the parties decided not to renew the
earlier agreement but to conclude in its place a new one - the
Agreement between the Agency and the Government of Italy
Concerning the Seat of the International Centre for Theoretical
Physics (INFCIRC/114)  -  hereinafter referred to as the Seat
Agreement . It dealt with five principal questions concerning the
Centre: the seat of the Centre; provision of public services;
privileges and immunities of the Agency at the Centre; liaison
with the government; and settlement of disputes.
<P>
At the same time, the Agency left open the question of the
participation of other interested international organizations in
the running of the Centre. In 1969, the Agreement between the
IAEA and UNESCO Concerning the Joint Operation of the
International Centre for Theoretical Physics at Trieste
(INFCIRC/132), hereinafter referred to as  Joint Operation
Agreement   was concluded. Article 1 sets out the purpose of the
Centre, which is to foster, through training and research, the
progress of all branches of theoretical physics in accordance
with the IAEA Statute and the UNESCO Constitution. The Centre's
functions were the training of young physicists for research,
especially from developing countries; help in fostering the
growth of advanced studies of theoretical physics, especially in
developing countries; conduct of original research; and the
provision of an international forum for personal contacts between
theoretical physicists from countries in all stages of
development.
<P>
The Centre's administration was to be carried out by the Agency
on behalf of both organizations. As a result, the ICTP's Director
and staff were IAEA personnel. However, decisions on the
appointment, promotion, and termination of the Centre's
professional staff were to be taken jointly by the IAEA and 
UNESCO.
<P>
The Agreement also established a Scientific Council, jointly
selected and appointed by the Directors General of the IAEA and
UNESCO. The Council's terms of reference <I>inter alia</I> are
the provision of advice to the Directors General of both
organizations on the training, research, and other programmes of
the Centre; the appointment of the Director and the staff needed
to carry out the ICTP's programmes; and the institutes of
theoretical physics in developing countries which will be
affiliated to or enter into federation agreements with the
Centre. The Council also evaluates the Centre's activities and
reports thereon to the Directors General of both organizations.
<P>
On financial matters, the Agreement provided for both
organizations to contribute to the Centre's budget, which would
form part of the Agency's budget.
<P>
<H3>Changes in the ICTP's administration </H3>
<P>
Changes in the arrangements for the administration of the Centre
were influenced by a number of factors. First, over the years,
the Centre had expanded its activities considerably to include
areas which were not related to the peaceful uses of atomic
energy. It was therefore doubtful whether it could continue as a
part of the Agency, while executing activities which were beyond
the IAEA's mandate. Secondly, the ICTP's activities could fit
more appropriately within the wide scientific mandate of UNESCO. 
Thirdly, the view was expressed that in consideration of Italy's
role as the host and the highest contributor to the Centre, it
should be given a more active role in the Centre's
administration. Lastly, UNESCO had indicated its willingness, as
a joint operator, to take over the administrative responsibility
for the Centre.
<P>
In 1992, the IAEA Director General was mandated by the Board to
transfer the ICTP's administrative responsibilities to UNESCO and
to negotiate an agreement in that respect. Tripartite
negotiations took place over several months between the Agency,
UNESCO, and the Italian Government. The talks resulted in the
conclusion of two agreements. The first -  Agreement between the
IAEA, UNESCO, and the Government of the Republic of Italy
concerning the International Centre for Theoretical Physics  at
Trieste (INFCIRC/418) - hereinafter referred to as the 
Tripartite Agreement , laid down a new framework for the Centre's
administration. The Joint Operations Agreement was replaced by a
new and modified agreement of the same title (INFCIRC/499).
<P>
<B>The Centre's President.</B> As the Centre's activities grew,
it became necessary to assign new responsibilities to the
founding Director, Professor Salam, in recognition of his immense
contributions. The IAEA and UNESCO as joint operators of the
Centre and the Italian Government as the host state and major
donor offered Professor Salam the position of the President of
the Centre which he took on 1 January 1994. The functions of the
President include, <I>inter alia</I>, the setting up of a forum
for the co-ordination of programmes of activities of the
international scientific institutions in the area of Trieste.
<P>
<H3>Tripartite Agreement</H3>
<P>
The Tripartite Agreement which entered into force 1 January 1996
contains a number of important provisions.
<P>
<B><I>Seat Agreement.</I></B> Article 1 amends the Seat Agreement
to provide the framework for the transfer of the administrative
responsibility from the Agency to UNESCO. UNESCO replaced the
Agency as a party to, and took over all rights and obligations of
the Agency, under the existing Seat Agreement on the
understanding that the relevant provisions on the Agreement of
the Privileges and Immunities of the Agency continues to be
applicable <I>mutatis mutandis</I> with regard to the Centre
after its transfer to UNESCO. Consequently, the words  the Agency 
are replaced as appropriate with  UNESCO  in the existing Seat
Agreement.
<P>
<B><I>The Organization of the Centre.</I></B> Article 2
establishes that the organizationalframework of the Centre
consists of the following: the Steering Committee; the Director;
and the Scientific Council.
<P>
<I>The Steering Committee.</I> A Steering Committee was created
by Article 3 as an apex authority for the Centre. An innovation
in the organization of the Centre, it is to be composed of the
following members: one high-level representative each designated
by the Director General of UNESCO, the Director General of the
Agency; and by the Italian Government; such other members as
may be appointed by the Steering Committee in order to ensure
appropriate representation of those countries or institutions
having made particularly important contributions to or having a
particular interest in the activities of the Centre; and the
Director who is also the <I>ex officio</I> Chairperson of the
Steering Committee.
<P>
The representatives of the two organizations and the Italian
Government may be accompanied by experts to meetings of the
Steering Committee. In addition, the Chairperson of the
Scientific Council may attend meetings of the Steering Committee
in an advisory capacity.
<P>
Article 4 sets out the functions of the Steering Committee, which
are: to formulate the general guidelines for the Centre's
activities, taking into account its objectives as specified in
the joint Operation Agreement; subject to the budgetary
appropriation by the respective competent organs, to determine
the annual level of the budget, the level of respective
contributions, the financial plans, and how the funds available
for the operation of the Centre are to be used; to consider the
proposals of the Director for the programme, work plans,
financial plans, and budget proposals of the Centre and to
take decisions thereon; to consider the annual and other reports
of the Director on the activities of the Centre; to submit a
report on the Centre's activities to UNESCO and the Agency; and
to recommend to the Director General of UNESCO the names of
candidates for the post of the Director of the Centre.
<P>
<B><I>The Director.</I></B> Article 5 provides for the 
appointment of the Director of the Centre by the Director General
of UNESCO in consultation with the IAEA Director General and the
Italian Government from candidates recommended by the Steering
Committee. The Director shall hold office for a term of 5 years
renewable and is the Centre's Chief Academic and Administrative
Officer. He or she is empowered to administer the Centre; prepare
proposals for the Centre's general activities and work plans
taking into account the advice of the Scientific Council for
submission to the Steering Committee for its approval; prepare
the financial plans and budget proposals of the Centre for
submission to the Steering Committee for its approval; execute
the ICTP's work programmes and make payments within the framework
of general guidelines and specific decisions adopted by the
Steering Committee in accordance with Article 4. Besides the
above enumeration, the Director has such other functions and
powers as may be prescribed by the Agreement pertaining to the
structure of the Centre or as may be conferred on him or her by
the Director General of UNESCO.
<P>
<B><I>The Scientific Council.</I></B> A new Scientific Council
was created under Article 6 on a broad geographical basis
composed of up to 12 distinguished specialists in disciplines
relevant to the Centre's activities. The members sit in their
personal capacity. The Council Chairperson is appointed jointly
by the Directors General of UNESCO and the IAEA, after
consultations with the Steering Committee and the ICTP Director.
The appointment is for a term of 4 years and he or she is
eligible for re-appointment. The Council's remaining members are
appointed by the ICTP Director after consultations with the
Council Chairperson and serve for a term of 4 years.
Additionally, UNESCO, the IAEA, and the Italian Government may
send specialists in scientific programmes to attend Scientific
Council meetings.
<P>
The Council's functions are to advise the Centre on programmes of
activity, having due regard to relevant global academic,
scientific, and educational trends. The Steering Committee and
the Director may request the Council's advice on specific issues. 
<P>
<B><I>Financial Commitments.</I></B> To strengthen the Centre's
financial base, UNESCO, the Agency, and the Italian Government
agreed to contribute to the Centre's budget. The level of
contributions of UNESCO and the Agency (subject to budgetary
appropriations approved by their competent organs) shall not be
lower than that agreed in the exchange of letters dated 11
December 1990, augmented by the respective inflation factor
employed by each organization in the calculation of its budget.
The Italian Government is to maintain its financial contribution
to the Centre at a level not lower than that specified in the
same Exchange of Letters or any higher contribution decided upon
by the Steering Committee pursuant to Article 4(a). (The Exchange
of Letters terminated on the date the Tripartite Agreement
entered into force.) As of 1991, the IAEA contributed just over
US $1.3 million, UNESCO just over $331,000, and the Italian
Government 20 billion Lire annually to the Centre's budget.
<P>
Funds allocated for the Centre's operation are paid into a
special account set up by the Director General of UNESCO in
accordance with the relevant provisions of that organization's
financial regulations. The special account is  operated and the
Centre's budget administered in accordance with the same
regulations.
<P>
<B><I>Transfer Of Assets And Liabilities.</I></B> Under Article
10, UNESCO shall take over in accordance with arrangements to be
made between the two parties from the Agency all assets including
property and liability pertaining to the Centre.
<P>
Article 11 provides for the transfer to UNESCO of Agency staff
members posted at the Centre. The transfer is to be effected by
agreement between the two organizations taking into account the
provisions of the Tripartite Agreement and the new Joint
Operation Agreement. All matters not expressly agreed upon by the
Parties are to be dealt with in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Inter-Organization Agreement Concerning
Transfer, Secondment or Loan of Staff among the Organizations
applying the United Nations Common System of Salaries and
Allowances. It was underlined in the Article that the transfer
itself should not adversely affect the conditions of employment
of the said staff members posted at the Centre, including the
duration of their contracts and fringe benefits, subject to
the availability of the funds for the operation of the Centre.
Agency staff members transferred to UNESCO pursuant to this
provision shall become staff members of UNESCO.
<P>
The transfer to UNESCO of Agency staff posted to the Centre was
perhaps the most intricate exercise. UNESCO offered the affected
staff new contracts. These staff will continue to enjoy the same
conditions in respect of duration of contracts, promotion, and
recruitment policy as existed before the transfer. The modalities
for the transfer of staff, assets, and liabilities of the Centre
to UNESCO were embodied in a Memorandum of Understanding
concerning the Transfer of the Administrative Responsibility for
ICTP from the IAEA to UNESCO. This document was signed in Trieste
by the Directors General of both organizations at the formal
transfer of the Centre on 11 January 1996.
<P>
<B><I>Joint Operation Agreement.</I></B> In view of the changes
in the Centre's organizational framework, Article 12 of the
Tripartite Agreement provided for amendments to the Joint
Operation Agreement. A new Agreement was prepared to replace the
old one. In it, the purpose of the Centre was amended by
providing that it will foster, through training and research,
progress in physics, particularly theoretical physics, in
accordance with the constitution of UNESCO and the IAEA Statute.
The provisions on the Centre's functions, its staff, and details
of collaboration remain the same as in the old agreement. The new
Joint Operation Agreement came into force on the same date as the
Tripartite Agreement. 
<P>
<H3>Renewed support for the ICTP</H3>
<P>
The transfer of the Centre's administrative responsibility from
the IAEA to UNESCO does not mean the termination of the Agency's
interests and participation in its activities. In accordance with
the provisions of the Tripartite Agreement, the Agency will
continue to play an important role in the operation of the
Centre, including contributions to its budget and the
determination of the programmes of activity.
<P>
A difference can, however, be discerned between the IAEA's
approach to the administration of the Centre and that adopted by
UNESCO. Before the transfer, the Centre was administered as a
unit of the Agency's Secretariat and therefore enjoyed full
administrative support services from headquarters. UNESCO, on the
other hand, has granted the Centre a large measure of autonomy
pursuant to which the Centre will cater for itself in terms of
administrative support.
<P>
It is hoped that the ICTP's new institutional arrangement will
invigorate activities and strengthen the co-operation of the
IAEA, UNESCO, and the Italian Government in supporting the
Centre's activities.

  <H2>Nuclear energy & the environmental debate: <BR>The context
of choices</H2>
  <P>
  <I>Through international bodies on climate change, the roles of
nuclear power and other energy
  options are being assessed</I>
  <P>
  <B><A HREF="#author">by Evelyne Bertel and Joop Van de
Vate</A></B>
  <P>
  <HR>
  <P>
  Environmental issues are high on international agendas.
Governments, interest groups, and citizens are
  increasingly aware of the need to limit environmental impacts
from human activities. In the energy
  sector, one focus has been on greenhouse gas emissions which
could lead to global climate change. The
  issue is likely to be a driving factor in choices about energy
options for electricity generation during the
  coming decades. Nuclear power's future will undoubtedly be
influenced by this debate, and its potential
  role in reducing environmental impacts from the electricity
sector will be of central importance.
  <P>
  Scientifically there is little doubt that increasing
atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases, such as carbon
  dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) and methane, will cause climate change
on a global scale. However,
  the natural climate variability is still larger than the
estimated anthropogenic contributions to climate
  change. 
  <P>
  Despite uncertainties, the threat of climate change remains a
serious long-term global risk. Scenarios
  with time horizons of 2100 and beyond have to be developed,
requiring insight into long-term
  development of life-styles, socio-economics, and technology.
Such scenarios are of a normative
  character and therefore are inherently subjective. What is
known is that energy consumption is one of
  the major sources of greenhouse gases, and nuclear power
nowadays avoids more than 8% of the
  worldwide CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions.
  <P>
  Two major international bodies are involved in climate change
matters: the Conference of Parties to the
  Framework Convention on Climate Change (CoP/FCCC), which had
its First Session in March/April
  1995, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
which has been active since 1988.
  Since the energy sector is responsible for the major share of
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions,
  international organisations having expertise and mandate in the
field of energy, such as the IAEA, are
  actively involved in the activities of these bodies. In this
connection, the IAEA participated in the
  preparation of the second Scientific Assessment Report (SAR) of
the Intergovernmental Panel on
  Climate Change (IPCC).
  <P>
  The IAEA has provided the IPCC with documented information and
results from its ongoing
  programmes on the potential role of nuclear power in
alleviating the risk of global climate change. In
  particular, the IAEA prepared, jointly with the Nuclear Energy
Agency of the Organization for
  Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD/NEA), sections on
nuclear power of the SAR chapter
  dealing with energy supply mitigation options. This chapter
includes a description of different options
  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; a presentation of
illustrative low CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission
  energy supply scenarios; and a discussion on measures for
implementing low carbon emitting
  technologies and strategies. The IAEA and OECD/NEA also
prepared a supporting document to the
  SAR, <I>Nuclear Power in the Context of Alleviating Greenhouse
Gas Emissions,</I> which was
  published in the IAEA TECDOC series in April 1995. 
  <P>
  This article describes the main functions of these two
international bodies and reports on the IAEA's
  contribution to the IPCC's second Scientific Assessment Report,
which is being submitted in early 1996
  to the CoP/FCCC .
  <P>
  <H3>Global bodies related to climate change</H3>
  <P>
  In 1992, the UN Conference on Environment and Development
(Earth Summit) in Rio dealt with the
  sustainability of the Earth in terms of avoiding climate
change, environmental pollution, and resource
  depletion. In Rio, the Framework Convention on Climate Change
(FCCC) was signed. It entered into
  force in 1994 after being ratified by more than 50 countries.
The FCCC's objective is to lower the
  atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration to non-hazardous
levels. This will require draconian
  measures, especially by the industrialized countries where
<I>per capita</I>
  CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions are more than ten times those of
developing countries. Industrialized
  countries will have to compensate for the increased
CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions that are inherent
  to the socio-economic development and rising populations of the
developing countries. This equity
  consideration, laid down in the FCCC, is a frequent political
discussion point in inter-governmental
  meetings related to climate change.
  <P>
  The CoP/FCCC, the supreme body of the Convention, was
established by the Earth Summit in 1992
  and had its first session in Berlin, in March and April 1995.
It reviews the implementation of the
  FCCC and makes decisions necessary to promote the Convention's
implementation. Several subsidiary
  bodies also have been established: the Convention established
the Subsidiary Body for Implementation
  (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological
Advice (SBSTA). In Berlin, the
  CoP/FCCC set up the Ad hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AG/BM)
to draft a protocol for the period
  beyond 2000. SBI will develop recommendations to assist the CoP
in its review and assessment of the
  Convention's implementation. SBSTA will be the link between the
scientific and technological
  assessments and the information provided by international
bodies on the one hand, and the policy-
  oriented needs of the CoP on the other hand. The IAEA will be
involved in activities carried out by
  these FCCC-related bodies.
  <P>
  The IPCC is an independent, scientific, and technical body with
a mission to help policy-makers
  mitigate global climate change. As part of its work, the IPCC
produces Scientific Assessment Reports
  on climate change. Its first report was published in 1990 and
updated in a supplement in 1992. The
  second report was endorsed in late 1995 at the IPCC meeting in
Madrid, and is expected to be
  published in early 1996.  A  third assessment report is
scheduled for 1998.
  <P>
  In a co-operative project with the OECD, the IPCC has also
produced <I>Guidelines for National
  Greenhouse Gas Inventories.</I> They will assist governments in
reporting regularly to the
  CoP/FCCC about the implementation of the national measures to
lower their emissions of greenhouse
  gases.
  <P>The  Scientific Assessment Reports are drafted by experts
from a broad spectrum of scientific
  disciplines. They are subject to review by national and
international experts before being submitted for
  approval by plenary meetings of IPCC and its three Working
Groups. Working Group I, on Scientific
  Assessment, deals with climatology. Working Group II, on
Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation, covers
  topics such as the rise of sea levels, energy, and
desertification. Working Group III, on Socio-economic
  and Cross-cutting Issues, assesses socio-economic literature
related to climate change. Working Groups
  I and II have evaluated CO<SUB>2</SUB> emission scenarios with
time horizons up to 2100.
  <P>
  In contributing to these evaluations, the IAEA has emphasized
the potential role of nuclear energy in
  the context of comprehensive comparative assessments.
  <P>
  <H3>The context of choices</H3>
  <P>
  All electricity generation options involve some environmental
impacts. However, when they are fitted
  to state-of-the-art technologies, the options are able to
deliver electricity at relatively low risks to the
  environment. In particular, a number of technical options exist
for alleviating or mitigating greenhouse
  gas emissions from the power sector. Policy measures such as
taxes, subsidies, and emission permits
  can also be used as a means to reflect the estimated full cost
to society of alternative options. The
  challenge for decision-makers in the power sector is to design
and implement timely strategies based
  upon energy mixes that aim towards minimizing adverse
environmental, health, and social impacts at
  the lowest total cost for society.
  <P>
  The technical options that can be considered in the power
sector range from efficiency improvement to
  CO<SUB>2</SUB> sequestration through shifting to fuels with low
or no carbon content.
  However, at the decision-making level, technico-economic
factors and barriers to implementation have
  to be recognized and taken into account. Energy efficiency
improvements are not infinite and have a
  cost which tends to increase very rapidly once the
straightforward savings have been achieved.
  <P>
  Some technological options   which might seem extremely
attractive on scientific grounds   are far
  from having reached the stage of industrial development or even
technical feasibility demonstration.
  Therefore, these options are not likely to make any significant
contribution to reducing greenhouse gas
  emissions or other health and environmental burdens in the
short and medium terms. For example,
  carbon dioxide capture and disposal in deep oceans, or energy
systems based upon hydrogen as a
  carrier, might contribute substantially to greenhouse gas
reduction in the long term. But they will by no
  means be industrially mature and economically competitive
within the coming decades. Renewable
  sources, with the notable exceptions of hydropower and biomass,
do not offer realistic prospects for
  large-scale baseload electricity generation.
  <P>
  <H3>Nuclear power and electricity options</H3>
  <P>
  Nuclear power is a proven technology available today that can
contribute significantly to reducing
  greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental burdens from
the energy sector and to meeting
  environmental protection objectives. In the long term   as the
executive summary of the SAR chapter
  on energy supply mitigation options states    nuclear energy
could replace baseload fossil fuel
  electricity generation in most parts of the world, if generally
acceptable responses can be found to
  concerns about reactor safety, radioactive waste disposal, and
proliferation .
  <P>
  The use of nuclear energy for electricity generation dates back
to the late 1950s and it has reached a
  stage of industrial maturity. At the end of 1994, there were
432 nuclear units connected to the grid with
  a total installed capacity of some 340 gigawatts-electric
(GWe). In 1994, the nuclear electricity
  generated worldwide exceeded 2300 terawatt-hours (TWh),
supplying 17% of the total electricity
  consumption. The accumulated operating experience of nuclear
power plants is now over 7200 reactor-
  years and the average operating performance is improving
continuously with an energy availability
  factor above 70% since the mid-1980s. This experience places
nuclear power among the technologies
  that decision-makers can consider for sustainable electricity
system expansion in the coming years and
  decades.
  <P>
  While environmental concerns are likely to be major driving
forces in choices about electricity
  generation, the economic competitiveness of options will remain
a cornerstone in assessing and
  choosing alternative sources. Although there are indications
that technical breakthroughs could reduce
  significantly the costs of electricity generated by some
renewable energy sources other than
  hydropower, such as solar photovoltaic and wind power, these
options are unlikely to be competitive
  with fossil fuels or nuclear power for baseload generation
before the second or third decade of the next
  century. In most countries, oil is not considered for baseload
electricity generation owing to the
  volatility of market prices and concerns on security of supply.
Therefore, in most countries the choices
  for baseload electricity generation plants to be commissioned
within one or two decades will essentially
  be limited to fossil fuels, mainly coal and gas, nuclear power,
and, where favourable sites exist,
  hydropower.
  <P>
  The relative costs of electricity generation by coal, gas,
nuclear, and hydro power plants vary from
  country to country and are highly dependent on local
conditions, discount rates, and expectations
  regarding the future coal and gas price trends. Coal is and
will remain an economically attractive option
  in a number of countries having access to cheap domestic
resources. As a result of the development of
  highly efficient combined cycle technologies, gas has become
competitive for baseload electricity
  generation in a number of countries. However, gas-generated
electricity costs are very sensitive to gas
  prices that might increase significantly if market demand grows
rapidly. Where favourable sites exist,
  hydropower projects offer opportunities for low-cost
electricity generation. However, the number of
  these sites is limited and, in many countries, social and
environmental impacts of large dams are
  preventing the implementation of hydropower plants. Moreover,
recent publications indicate that
  hydropower generation could be unfriendly to the climate
because of emissions of greenhouse gases
  from the water reservoirs.
  <P>
  In spite of their high investment costs, nuclear power plants
compete favourably with fossil-fuelled
  units in most countries. This is especially the case where
nuclear programmes have been soundly
  implemented and managed and where fossil fuels are not
accessible at low prices. Ongoing research
  and development is expected to bring further enhancement of the
performance of nuclear power plants
  that will lead to lower costs of nuclear electricity
generation. Moreover, owing to the comprehensive
  approach adopted for calculating nuclear electricity generation
costs, the non-internalized social, health,
  and environmental costs are very small relative to the direct
estimated costs, and they are much smaller
  than in the case of fossil-fuelled systems. Factoring in these
costs should reinforce nuclear power's
  competitive margin.
  <P>
  <B>Environmental Impacts.</B> With regard to environmental
impacts, nuclear power offers
  specific benefits. In routine operation, nuclear power plants
and the fuel cycle facilities do release small
  quantities of radioactive materials. However, the rules
developed and implemented several decades ago
  for limiting radioactive emissions satisfy criteria for
protecting human health and are more than
  adequate to protect the environment. The other emissions,
residuals, and burdens from nuclear power
  plants and fuel cycle facilities are lower than those arising
from fossil-fuel electricity generation chains
  and comparable or lower than those from renewable energy
systems. Taking into account the entire up-
  stream and down-stream energy chains for electricity
generation, nuclear power emits 40 to 100 times
  less carbon dioxide than currently used fossil-fuel chains.
Greenhouse gas emissions from the nuclear
  chain are due mainly to the use of fossil fuels in the
extraction, processing, and enrichment of uranium
  and to fuels used in the production of steel and cement for the
construction of reactors and fuel cycle
  facilities. These emissions, which are negligible relative to
those from the direct use of fossil fuels for
  electricity generation, can be reduced even further by energy
efficiency improvements. Such
  improvements at the enrichment step include, for example,
replacing the gaseous diffusion process by
  less energy-intensive processes such as centrifugation or laser
isotope separation.
  <P>
  The role that nuclear electricity already plays in alleviating
the risk of global climate change is notable.
  It is illustrated by the fact that if the nuclear power plants
in operation worldwide would be substituted
  by fossil-fuelled power plants, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions
from the energy sector would
  increase by more than 8%. This level   which almost equals the
avoidance of emissions by
  hydropower   has been achieved in a number of countries in
about two decades of nuclear power
  development.
  <P>
  The analysis of statistical data in different countries over
the last 20 years shows that countries which
  implemented large nuclear programmes, such as Belgium, France,
and Sweden, achieved
  simultaneously significant reductions of their CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions. In France, for
  example, both CO<SUB>2</SUB> and sulphur dioxide emissions were
reduced by more than three
  between 1982 and 1992, although electricity production nearly
doubled, owing to the share of nuclear
  power in electricity supply. In the United States, if nuclear
energy would not have been used between
  1973 and 1994, some additional 1750 million metric tons of
CO<SUB>2</SUB> would have been
  released in the atmosphere. Countries and regions which do not
deploy nuclear power on a large scale
    for example, developing countries   had a relatively high
increase rate of CO<SUB>2</SUB>
  emissions.
  <P>
  <H3>A long-term perspective</H3>
  <P>
  Over the long term, nuclear fuel resources and existing
industrial infrastructures can support a broad
  deployment of nuclear power programmes in many countries. If
the barriers to the implementation of
  nuclear power were alleviated, nuclear electricity generation
could grow steadily from now on and
  throughout the next century. The long-term nuclear scenario
developed by the IAEA in co-operation
  with the OECD/NEA for the IPCC illustrates this point.
  <P>
  This scenario was set up in the context of the global energy
and electricity demand projections outlined
  in IPCC's SAR chapter on energy supply mitigation options. It
assumes that nuclear power would be
  deployed widely for alleviating the risk of global climate
change and would penetrate the market on
  grounds of its economic competitiveness. It implies that the
present policy barriers to nuclear power
  deployment   such as moratoria on construction of new nuclear
power plants and political decisions to
  ignore the nuclear option   will be progressively removed, and
that nuclear projects in developing
  countries will be facilitated by enhanced technology adaptation
and transfer, and financial support from
  development banks.
  <P>
  The assumptions adopted for estimating the penetration rates of
nuclear power in different regions
  reflect the need for diversity of supply and the availability
and competitiveness of alternative options.
  The options include oil and gas in the Middle East and, in the
long term, biomass and other renewable
  sources. Potential uses of nuclear power for heat and hydrogen
production have not been taken into
  account because of the uncertainties regarding the
competitiveness of nuclear power for such
  applications.
  <P>
  By 2100 in this scenario, the share of nuclear power in total
electricity generation would range from
  less than 20% in Africa, Australia and New Zealand, and the
Middle East to 75% in Western Europe.
  The total installed nuclear capacity would grow from the
present 340 GWe to some 3300 GWe in 2100
  and nuclear power would provide 46% of the worldwide
electricity consumption, as compared to 17%
  today.
  <P>
  The technical constraints taken into account in estimating
potential nuclear capacity growth rates include
  construction lead times and industrial capabilities for
building nuclear power plants and fuel cycle
  facilities. The availability of sites for nuclear
installations, including radioactive waste repositories, was
  also considered by region, taking into account seismicity,
cooling water requirements and the need to
  build nuclear facilities in areas with relatively low
population density. The availability of natural
  resources for nuclear fuel would not place any major constraint
on the development of nuclear power,
  taking into account known uranium and thorium resources and
expected technological progress in fissile
  material utilization. This scenario would require the
deployment of breeder reactors by 2025 in order to
  support nuclear electricity generation over the period up to
2100 with the presently known uranium
  resources. However, within that time frame, additional uranium
resources would likely become
  available whenever necessary. Moreover, other types of nuclear
power plants, such as thorium fuelled
  reactors, hybrid systems, and even fusion reactors, might be
developed and commercially deployed.
  <P>
  The implementation of this nuclear scenario would allow
reductions in carbon dioxide emissions
  worldwide by a factor of three as compared to the present
level. A similar reduction would be feasible
  without nuclear power only if renewable energy sources, which
have not yet reached the level of
  commercial development, would enter into the market early in
the next century and would be deployed
  at very high rates throughout the next century.
  <P>
  <H3>Sustainable energy development</H3>
  <P>
  The years ahead will see increasing demand for energy, and in
particular the need for additional
  electricity generation capacity. These challenges will be
combined with the necessity to reduce the
  health and environmental burdens induced by the burning of
fossil fuels. Taken together, they call for
  the development of all available energy sources and
technological options that can meet environmental
  protection and economic efficiency goals in the short, medium,
and long term.
  <P>
  Nuclear power is one option for reducing emissions and
residuals from electricity generation and for
  mitigating health and environmental impacts from the energy
sector. In order to make a significant
  contribution in the implementation of sustainable electricity
supply strategies worldwide, nuclear power
  should reinforce its competitiveness versus fossil-fuel based
systems and, in the long term, versus
  renewable sources. The barriers to nuclear power deployment
should be alleviated by continuing
  demonstration that reactors and fuel cycle facilities can be
operated in a reliable and safe manner and
  that technical solutions already existing for final disposal of
all radioactive wastes can be implemented
  wherever needed.
  <P>
  Continuing progress is being achieved in terms of technical
performance, safety, and competitiveness of
  nuclear power plants. These advances should enhance the
viability of the nuclear option in an
  increasing number of countries. The continuation or renaissance
of nuclear power programmes in all
  countries where it is a viable option   based upon the
assessment of its economic and environmental
  benefits as compared to alternative energy sources   would
contribute significantly to enhancing the
  sustainability of energy supply systems.

<H2>Nuclear power plant safety: <BR>Steps toward better
performance</H2>
<P>
<I>At many nuclear plants, self-assessment processes are helping
management to review and improve levels of safety</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author_a">by Keith Hide</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
As part of the nuclear industry's response to the accidents at
Three Mile Island (TMI) in 1979 and at Chernobyl in 1986,
programmes to evaluate and encourage improvements in the
operational safety performance of nuclear power plants were
initiated. In the United States, the Institute of Nuclear Power
Operations (INPO) was founded by nuclear utilities. It performs
periodic operational safety evaluations of all nuclear power
plants
in the USA. INPO also provides a number of other services to help
US and volunteer international utilities improve their safety
performance. 
<P>
On a broader international scale, the IAEA initiated the
Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) programme for voluntary
reviews of operational safety performance at power plants
worldwide. The IAEA also initiated other voluntary programmes  
such as those on the Assessment of Safety Significant Events
(ASSET), Assessment of Safety Culture in Organizations (ASCOT),
and
the Incident Reporting System (IRS)   to assist nuclear plant
operators in evaluating and strengthening their safety
performance.
<P>
In September 1994, IAEA Member States began the process of
ratifying a new Convention on Nuclear Safety. This convention
will
establish, for the first time, internationally agreed obligations
for ensuring the safety of nuclear power plants and the
commitment
of the signatory States to meeting them. Under the Convention,
Member States with nuclear power plants will report periodically
to
their peers on the measures taken to meet their obligations. 
<P>
Although the exact nature of the reports to be made under the
Convention has yet to be determined, Member States will need to
determine, in some way, the degree to which the performance of
their own nuclear power plant programme is in accordance with the
obligations of the Convention. Operational safety performance
reviews performed by independent organizations such as the IAEA
could provide information for this purpose, but the substantial
outside resources they require limit their availability. 
<P>
Many utilities have chosen to use self-assessment processes to
help
their management obtain current information about safety
performance. Regulatory authorities are increasingly recognizing
and using self-assessments to judge nuclear power plant safety
performance. Experience has shown that when organizations
objectively assess their own performance, understanding of the
need
for improvements and the motivation to achieve them is
significantly enhanced. Such self-assessments might also
contribute
substantially to the periodic reports required by the Convention.
<P>
For purposes of discussion, self-assessment practices can be
grouped into three general areas as follows:
<UL>
<LI>frequent or continuous monitoring of performance against
established management performance expectations;
<LI>periodic, in-depth reviews of the effectiveness of selected
activities or programmes by in-house teams of experienced
reviewers
and technical experts; and 
<LI>one-time, in-depth reviews to probe the full extent and basic
causes of known weak performance areas.
</UL>
<P>
This article outlines these self-assessment practices and the
benefits they are providing. 
<P>
<H3>Performance monitoring</H3>
<P>
Many utilities now use a variety of performance indicators to set
and communicate their goals or expectations for performance of
plant equipment, programmes, and personnel in areas that affect
safety, production and efficiency. Performance indicators are
best
expressed in clear, numerical terms that relate to performance in
a variety of areas. They normally include the ten major
performance
indicators that are reported to the World Association of Nuclear
Operators (WANO) by nuclear utilities worldwide and a substantial
number of others that are based on the particular needs of
individual plants and groups, such as chemistry, radiological
protection, and maintenance, within plant organizations. Many
plants use the results achieved by top-performing plants or
established industry standards as benchmarks to set their own
goals
for performance and improvement.
<P>
Structured monitoring of actual performance results against the
agreed performance indicator goals helps provide management and
other plant personnel with useful information on the current
performance and areas in need of additional attention. Some
utilities establish, for each performance indicator or related
groups of indicators, a series of numerical values that reflect
significant weakness, the need for some improvement, satisfactory
performance, or significant strength. Periodic reports to
management on performance can then be tailored to reflect not
only
the current level of performance, but the trend in performance.
Colour-coding is sometimes used to help highlight results and
trends in these reports.
<P>
Performance monitoring against goals provides management with
frequent, objective information on the quality of plant
operations
in the areas addressed by the performance indicators. It further
allows managers to address their attention to the areas where
assistance or additional support may be needed to meet station
performance goals. Another major advantage of this type of
monitoring is that reports of performance can be easily shared,
by
means of graphs and visual presentations, with all plant
personnel.
This helps keep all personnel aware of current performance in
their
own areas and in areas that they support. Some utilities format
these reports in the form of annunciator panels colour-coded to
reflect the results according to specified performance
categories,
and display them throughout the plant. Many have found that the
use
of such systems significantly enhances understanding and support
within the plant staff of management's goals for performance and
how they relate to their own activities.
<P>
<H3>Periodic effectiveness reviews</H3>
<P>
Though performance indicators and goals provide information on a
frequent basis, their value is limited to the specific areas
selected for monitoring, and they do not give much insight into
the
causes of performance weaknesses. Effectiveness reviews that look
into qualitative as well as quantitative information have also
proven to be valuable self-assessment tools. These reviews do
examine adherence to regulatory or external requirements, but the
most effective reviews go well beyond that to examine the
effectiveness and efficiency of programmes and activities in
achieving their intended purpose. Effectiveness reviews of major
plant evolutions, such as outages and plant startups, often
provide
valuable insights into plant and staff performance. They may also
be useful in assessing the effectiveness of corporate support or
support from other organizations that can impact plant operation
and safety performance.
<P>
Effectiveness reviews may be accomplished by teams of individuals
who are independent of the activity being reviewed, by those who
are closely involved in the activity on a day-to-day basis or,
ideally, by teams including both. Such reviews may be done well
by
quality assurance personnel, if they have current expertise and
experience in the area to be reviewed. However, many utilities
have
discovered the advantages of using personnel who are directly
involved in or responsible for the activity under review as
members
of these teams. Such individuals bring valuable insights into the
review process and improve the quality of review results. But
perhaps more importantly, they often gain fresh perspectives and
understanding from their participation that increases their
awareness of problems, the importance of correcting them and
possible ways of correcting them. In addition, the training they
receive in review techniques by virtue of their participation
often
significantly improves their ability to assess performance in
their
own areas of responsibility on a day-to-day basis.
<P>
Strong support from management has been shown to be an essential
factor in achieving good effectiveness reviews. This can be shown
by selection of capable review team members including appropriate
management and supervisory personnel, support of each team's
efforts to identify all contributing problems and their causes,
and
responding to the results of reviews in a positive way that
supports improvement without punitive action or embarrassment.
These factors are important to obtaining the open sharing of
information and opinion between reviewers and those being
reviewed
that is needed to produce good results.
<P>
Quality assurance programmes have traditionally provided a
framework for review or audit of station programmes and
activities,
using review schedules that provide periodic examination of
important performance areas and focusing on adherence with
quality
programme requirements and regulations. However, many current
self-assessment efforts expand considerably on this framework by
performing reviews at the request of managers or staff personnel
and focusing more on overall effectiveness of programmes and
activities in achieving their intended purpose. In some plants,
more than 50% of the assessments performed are a consequence of
plant staff requests, and managers and other personnel at all
levels participate in assessment teams.
<P>
<H3>One-time reviews of problem areas</H3>
<P>
Most utilities recognize that focusing self-assessments or
effectiveness reviews on known or suspected problem areas is one
of
the most effective ways of improving performance. At least one
utility senior manager has stated that his manager's primary
responsibility is finding problems and opportunities for
improvement and making the appropriate improvements.
Opportunities
for improvement may be identified through performance indicator
monitoring, plant and industry operating experience, comparison
with other nuclear power plants, and a variety of other means.
The
principles for achieving good reviews are the same as those
stated
above for periodic reviews.
<P>
An example of the use of one-time problem reviews concerns the
system used at one nuclear power plant to tag equipment that was
out-of-service for maintenance work. After a few minor cases of
errors in tagging, plant managers decided to conduct an in-depth
review of its tagging procedures and related activities. They
formed a team that included members of the maintenance staff,
operations staff, technical support staff, and others, and
required
them to examine all aspects of the tagging system. The team
attempted to flow-chart the tagging process and found that they
were unable to do so. At the conclusion of their work, the team
had
identified many deficiencies in the effectiveness of the system,
foremost of which were its complexity and the lack of
understanding
of it by those who used it on a day-to-day basis. The plant then
developed a completely new, simpler process that could be more
easily understood and used more reliably. 
<P>
In another example, a utility that had experienced several
indications of deteriorating performance in broad areas elected
to
perform a comprehensive review of the management and
effectiveness
of all station activities. In this case, the problems were
considered to be so pervasive that the utility decided the team
should be comprised of experienced plant operations experts from
outside the company. A team of senior experts with excellent
knowledge and current experience in plant operations and
management
was assembled by the utility and given strong support in
identifying the fundamental causes of the plant's malaise. The
results initiated many fundamental improvements in the management
of plant activities and the responsibilities given to plant
personnel. It was recognized by the national regulatory authority
as an effective identification of fundamental problems at the
plant. As a result, an extensive regulatory review was avoided.
Both the regulatory authority and the plant considered the
self-assessment more useful than a regulatory inspection, because
of the expertise of the reviewers and because of the plant's
positive recognition and ownership of the results.
<P>
<H3>Peer review programmes</H3>
<P>
Utilities in at least four countries have implemented their own
peer review programmes and are using their own expertise to
assess
performance in each of their nuclear power plants. They have
organized programmes for peers from other stations to assess each
of their nuclear stations at regular intervals. These programmes
provide valuable training in proven review techniques to numerous
plant personnel who participate as peer reviewers. The knowledge
and experience they gain pay dividends when they return to their
own plants. They can view performance in their own areas more
objectively and with a fresh perspective. Often, they get ideas
from the plant being reviewed that they use to strengthen their
own
performance.
<P>
<H3>Regulatory overview</H3>
<P>
Some regulatory agencies believe that encouraging self-assessment
and checking on the thoroughness and results of such efforts
provides valuable insight for the regulator and promotes a sense
of
ownership for problem identification and correction within the
utility, where it is most important. As a result, they are
increasing their efforts to ensure that all utilities implement
effective self-assessment programmes to detect operational
weaknesses and identify the fundamental causes early. It is
believed that review of self-assessment results can be an
improved
alternative to regulatory inspections as a means of ensuring that
plants maintain high standards of performance.
<P>
<H3>International initiatives</H3>
<P>
Those involved in the use of self-assessment programmes agree
that
self-assessments represent one of the most powerful tools for
improvement because of the following benefits:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>They are performed by individuals who are most knowledgeable
of
the people and practices at the nuclear power plant.
<LI>They can be easily tailored to the needs of individual
plants.
<LI>They minimize the potential for embarrassing exposure of
plant
weaknesses to outside persons, and maximize the opportunity for
candid, frank discussion of problem areas between reviewers and
staff members.
<LI>They strengthen insight into performance problems, their
causes, and their effects at all levels, and thus strengthen
support for improvement.
<LI>They can be performed on a frequent or continuous basis,
giving
management current information on the effectiveness of a wide
variety of programmes and activities.
</UL>
<P>
The IAEA is considering how it might best support the development
and use of self-assessments as a means of strengthening nuclear
power plant operational safety. Activities in progress or under
consideration include the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>providing guidance on self-assessment activities for
utilities
and regulators. An IAEA Safety Guide  is being developed;
<LI>supplementing the OSART process and OSART guidelines (IAEA
TECDOC-744, May 1994) to provide for reviewing the effectiveness
of
plant self-assessment activities;
<LI>using the OSART process to identify and collect best
practices
in self-assessment and sharing them with the industry through the
OSART Mission Results data base (OSMIR) and other methods;
<LI>sponsoring international conferences and workshops on
self-assessment;
<LI>assisting Member States in implementing self-assessment
programmes, upon request;
<LI>reviewing self-assessment processes and the results of
self-assessments upon request.
</UL>
<P>
Expectations for operational safety performance are reaching
higher
and higher levels, and international interest in the performance
of
individual nuclear utilities and power plants is increasing. In
this climate, the use of effective self-assessment processes is
expected to become more important in both well-developed and
developing nuclear programmes. Frequent, critical
self-examinations
of safety performance will be required to ensure that acceptable
levels of performance are achieved and maintained. As part of its
safety services to Member States, the IAEA will do its best to
support and encourage the use of self-assessments in nuclear
utilities and power plants.

 <H2>Future nuclear power plants:<BR>Harmonizing safety
objectives</H2>
<P>
<I>Through a number of co-operative avenues, technical features
of
tomorrow's nuclear reactors are drawing close attention</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF=#"author_g">by Leonid Kabanov</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Today's generation of nuclear power plants that are designed and
operated to current safety objectives and principles achieve a
high
level of safety. Even though the majority of operating plants
have
a good safety record,  there is considerable debate among safety
and nuclear power experts on how to do even better.
<P>
This quest for excellence rests upon several factors. First,
there
is a tendency for any industrial activity to become safer and
more
efficient as it develops over time. For the nuclear industry,
this
has meant upgrading plant safety levels by incorporating the
lessons learned from the many accumulated reactor-years of
operating experience, including accidents that have occurred.
Additionally, safety issues are being identified through
research,
testing, and other analysis, such as probabilistic safety
assessment (PSA). Second, there is a desire to maintain the
current
low level of risk to the public from nuclear power, as the number
of nuclear plants grows in the future. Third, there is a desire
to
further reduce the likelihood and radiological consequences of
any
potential large off-site release. By minimizing the potential
impact on public health and safety, the need for off-site
protective actions can be reduced. Finally in some countries,
efforts to raise the level of safety is a prerequisite for public
acceptance of a new or expanded nuclear power programme.
<P>
In 1992, the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG),
a body advising the IAEA Director General on safety issues,
proposed desirable features for enhancing the safety of future
nuclear power plants.<A HREF="#note">*</A> They incorporate
improved safety concepts
including those addressing human factors and specific design
features.
<P>
In the area of human factors, the features state that the design
should be user friendly, consider operating and maintenance
procedures, and reduce dependence on early operator actions. The
implementation of these features will allow operators more time
to
perform safety actions and thus provide even greater protection
against any possible release of radioactivity to the environment.
<P>
Regarding plant design, the features state that it should, in
particular, reduce the probability and consequences of severe
accidents, have confinement systems to cope with pressures and
temperatures occurring during severe accidents, and adequately
protect against sabotage and conventional armed attacks.
Consideration should also be given to passive safety features
that
are based on natural forces, such as convection and gravity,
making
safety functions less dependent on active systems and components
like pumps and valves.
<P>
In practice, some of these features are already being
incorporated
into modern plants that are under construction or have been
recently commissioned. Incorporation of other features are
envisaged in new designs being developed now.
<P>
This article reviews efforts that are being made internationally
to
develop safety objectives and principles for future nuclear power
plants. The work is directed towards contributing to an
international harmonization of safety approaches and to help
ensure
that future reactors worldwide meet a high standard of safety.
<P>
<H3>
Types of future nuclear plants</H3>
<P>
Tomorrow's nuclear power plants are being referred to in a number
of different ways:  next generation,  advanced, or  future 
nuclear plants are the terms most often used. The terms, which
are used interchangeably in this article, are primarily
time-related and generally refer to plants that comply with
national or international safety objectives and principles being
developed for nuclear power reactors that are not yet operating
or
under construction.
<P>Advanced designs under development comprise three basic types:

<UL>
<LI>water-cooled reactors, utilizing water as coolant and
moderator;
<LI>fast reactors, using liquid metal, e.g. sodium, as coolant;
and
<LI>gas-cooled reactors, using gas, e.g. helium, as coolant and
graphite as moderator.
</UL>
<P>
Most, about 85%, of today's operating nuclear power reactors are
water-cooled reactors. Most advanced designs that are well
developed also are water-cooled reactors. They are of two basic
types: light-water reactors (LWRs) with ordinary water as
moderator
and coolant, and heavy-water reactors (HWRs), which use deuterium
oxide (D<SUB>2</SUB>O). LWRs are in turn subdivided into boiling
and pressurized water reactors (BWRs and PWRs). Advanced LWRs
(ALWRs), sometimes called <I>evolutionary</I> reactors, are being
developed along two lines: large units in the size range of
1300-1500 megawatts-electric (MWe), and medium-size units of
about
600 MWe. As being developed mainly by Atomic Energy of Canada
Ltd.,
advanced HWRs similarly can be divided into large-size units,
those
with a power level of some 900 MWe, and smaller units with a
power
level of about 500 MWe.
<P>
The first class of large ALWRs comprises many designs and some of
them are a joint effort of different countries. In general, the
large units are similar to existing ones but incorporate advanced
features (relevant to safety, control, etc.) and design changes
to
make the plant more resistant to severe accidents. Examples of
some
advanced PWRs and BWRs  which are at a developed stage of design
and are under regulatory consideration include: the Advanced
Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR), a 1300-MWe plant being developed by
General Electric in the United States; the System 80+, a 1300-MWe
PWR being developed by ABB Combustion Engineering in the United
States; and the European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR), a
1500-MWe plant being developed by Nuclear Power International,
France, and Germany. The final safety evaluation reports and
design
approvals for the ABWR and System 80+ were issued in 1994 by the
US
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
<P>
The second class of ALWRs are plants which mainly use current
technology but include significant changes in order to make
intensive use of passive safety features. Some of them are at an
advanced stage of design and can be considered representative
examples. They include the Advanced Passive PWR (AP-600), a
600-MWe
plant being developed by Westinghouse in the United States; the
Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR), a 600-MWe plant being
developed by General Electric in the United States; and the
WWER-640 (V-407), a 640-MWe plant being developed by
Atomenergoproject and Gidropress in Russia.  The AP-600 and SBWR
are presently under review for design certification by the NRC,
and
the WWER-640 is in the stage of preliminary licensing by the
Russian regulatory body, Gosatomnadzor.
<P>
From the standpoint of nuclear plant safety, this
<I>evolutionary</I> process of development has gained wide
acceptance. At the same time,  there is an ongoing discussion on
the need to create a new generation of <I>innovative</I> plants
that incorporate radical changes in design philosophy to avoid
severe accidents. Such proposals are still in early design
stages,
and their development particularly faces problems associated with
financial and technical requirements for testing and verifying
the
designs.
<P>
<H3>Harmonizing safety objectives</H3>
<P>
Global efforts to harmonize  safety objectives for future nuclear
power plants involves many countries and organizations. In
addition
to the IAEA, inter-governmental organizations including the
Nuclear
Energy Agency of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD/NEA) and the European Commission are closely
involved in the work.
<P>
One of the IAEA's tasks is the development of nuclear safety
standards for all nuclear activities. In the nuclear power field,
these standards are developed with assistance from Member States
as
part of efforts to bridge different points of view and obtain
consensus. The agreed safety standards are hierarchically
organized
in four levels: at the highest level are  Safety Fundamentals,
followed by Safety Standards, (or NUSS codes), Safety Guides and
Safety Practices.
<P>
The exchange of information on nuclear safety research takes
place
within the working groups of OECD/NEA. Within the EC, a Reactor
Safety Working Group (RSWG) of representatives of safety
authorities, vendors, and utilities is active in exchange of
information and promoting harmonization in the field of rules and
guidelines for the design and operation of nuclear power plants.
Bilateral and multilateral exchanges among regulatory bodies also
occur, often under the auspices of the IAEA, OECD/NEA and Nuclear
Regulators' Working Group (NRWG) of the EC.
<P>
A special effort on harmonization of safety approaches has been
made by the Institute of Nuclear Protection and Safety (IPSN),
France, and the Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Anlagen und
Reaktorsicherheit
(GRS, the nuclear reactor safety institute) in Germany. The work
includes publication in 1993 of the document <I>GPR/PSK Proposal
for a Common Safety Approach for Future Pressurized Water
Reactors.</I>
<P>
Among nuclear utilities, many operators are interested in
defining
their needs and goals for nuclear plants  to be ordered in the
future. Toward this end, many utilities have looked to
co-operative
approaches, both at the national and international levels. In
1985,
US utilities started an industry-wide effort to establish the
technical foundation for the design of ALWRs. This ALWR programme
is being managed  by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)
and includes participation and sponsorship of several
international
utility companies and close co-operation with the US Department
of
Energy (DOE). The cornerstone of the programme is a document
setting out  utility design requirements (URD). Elsewhere,
utilities also worked together to issue  European Utility
Requirements (EUR).
<P>
The URD and EUR define utility requirements, including safety
goals
set by them, in particular to promote licensing of new reactor
designs. The URD, for example, presents a complete statement of
utility desires for  next generation  nuclear plants and in
particular addresses ALWR safety policy. The ALWR safety policy
features an integrated design approach to safety based on
defense-in-depth philosophy. It includes three overlapping levels
of safety protection: accident resistance, core damage
prevention,
and accident mitigation. Top-tier safety design requirements are
developed on the basis of the safety policy statement for each
level of safety protection and for a specific type of ALWR.
<P>
The EUR is a product of major European electricity producers and
associations and focuses on common requirements for future LWRs
to
be built in Europe. It is intended to be a tool for promoting
harmonization, in particular of main safety objectives and safety
requirements.
<P>
In drafting and reviewing both sets of requirements, many
utilities
in Asia, Europe, and North America have taken part. Even though
these documents cover requirements in  general for  the  entire
plant, they deal specifically with main safety objectives and
detailed safety approaches. These efforts also can be seen as an
important contribution to global harmonization of safety
approaches
and objectives for future nuclear power plants. 
<P>
<H3>Activities through the IAEA</H3>
<P>
The IAEA's efforts in this area received impetus in 1991 through
a
resolution of its General Conference. The resolution invited
initiation of activities on safety principles for the design of
future nuclear power plants using a step-by-step approach
based<I>
inter alia</I> on INSAG's work.
<P>
Since then, the Agency has convened a series of meetings aimed at
achieving agreement on safety definitions, terminology, and
classification of future reactors.  The meetings identified
desirable safety enhancements and topics relevant to the
development of new principles. INSAG safety reports were reviewed
as they relate to safety principles for future plants. Parts of
these documents requiring clarification and parts requiring
amplification were identified.
<P>
In June 1995, following INSAG's review and comment from its
Member
States, the Agency published a technical document, <I>Development
of Safety Principles for the Design of Future Nuclear Power
Plants</I> (IAEA TECDOC-801). The document proposes updates to
existing safety objectives and principles which could be used as
a
basis for developing those recommended for the design of future
nuclear power plants. Accordingly, it is intended to be useful to
reactor designers, owners, operators, researchers and regulators.
<P>
The proposals are intended to provide general guidance which, if
carefully and properly followed, will result in reactor designs
with enhanced safety characteristics beyond those currently in
operation. They are derived from lessons learned from recent
operational experience, research and development, design,
testing,
and analysis, as well as from attempts to reflect current trends
in
reactor design, such as the introduction of new technologies.
<P>
The proposals represent a contribution to the growing
international
consensus on what constitutes an appropriate set of technical
principles for the design of future reactors. The document's
starting point was the well-established set of objectives and
principles for nuclear plants laid down in the INSAG safety
report,
<I>Basic Safety Principles for Nuclear Power Plants</I> published
by the IAEA in 1988. According to definitions in this document,
safety objectives state <I>what</I> is to be achieved. Safety
principles are statements of<I> how</I> the objectives are to be
achieved.
<P>
The safety objectives and principles for today's plants are to a
large extent also valid  for future designs. However, the 1995
technical document proposes some modifications of the technical
safety objective and some new principles. The key proposal is
that
severe accidents beyond the existing design basis will be
systematically considered and explicitly addressed during the
design process for future reactors.
<P>
The document also emphasizes the need  to further lower  the risk
of any serious radiological consequences and to assure that the
potential need for prompt off-site protective actions can be
reduced or even eliminated.  Defense-in-depth remains the main
strategy to deal with severe accidents for future nuclear plants
and it is founded on measures for effective prevention and
mitigation. 
<P>
<H3>Areas of greater co-operation</H3>
<P>
A number of areas call for greater efforts to harmonize technical
and policy matters related to future nuclear power plants. While
many of these areas present promising opportunities, others do
not.
Some areas where a harmonized approach is lacking are likely to
remain that way for many years because of large national
differences in geography, culture, policy, and regulation. Other
areas are likely to remain flexible because of market forces.
<P>
Overall, greater co-operation is needed to resolve important
technical and policy differences. Increased harmonization would
likely improve the safety, cost, and availability of future
nuclear
power plants, and would likely improve the consistency and
efficiency of the licensing process. It might also have indirect
benefits in the area of public acceptance. The technical
convergence of safety experts, regulators, and utility operating
organizations around the world on a consistent set of principles
would likely increase confidence that the right conclusions have
been reached.
<P>
Specific opportunities for greater harmonization lie in the field
of safety assessment, including severe accident assessment.
Primarily needed is agreement among the many organizations that
conduct safety assessments on more common approaches. Specific
areas that need concerted co-operative efforts include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) methods, and the role
of
PSA in safety decision making, including the appropriate balance
among PSA, deterministic methods, and engineering  judgment;
<LI>methods and criteria for selecting those severe accident
sequences to be addressed in the design of future plants;
<LI>methods and criteria for treating uncertainties, and on the
practical implementation of policies that require analysis for
all
severe accident considerations;
<LI>approaches concerning the distinction between design basis
accidents, as analyzed for the licensing case, and severe
accidents
that are also considered in the design and considered by the
regulator;
<LI>safety assessment procedures within the licensing process
from
country to country, including technical documentation
requirements;
consideration also should be given to harmonization steps that
ease
the complications inherent in licensing a plant designed to the
codes and standards of a different country;
<LI>improved consistency in source-term evaluation methods, and
other methods for calculating radiological consequences of
accidents.
</UL>
<P>
It should also be noted that national approaches for dealing with
external hazards vary substantially. Harmonization of practices
for
future plants seems to be difficult because types and levels of
external hazards are site-specific. The issue of external hazards
has emerged as an increasingly important one as greater safety
levels are achieved for internal hazards, leaving the relative
contribution from external hazards more relevant.
<P>
Additionally, high-level safety goals should be defined that
allow
safety targets unique to nuclear power plants to be derived from
and compared to the broader issues of public health and safety
protection for other enterprises. A step in this direction is the
IAEA's publication of the technical document, <I>Policy for
Setting
and Assessing Regulatory Safety Goals</I> (IAEA TECDOC-831). It
reflects peer group discussion of senior regulators from 22
Member
States.
<P>
The work is part of the Agency's continuing effort to contribute
to
the process of wide international discussion on the harmonization
of safety goals, objectives, and principles for future nuclear
power plants. The process can help ensure that diverse and
different views are fully considered and balanced through greater
international co-operation in this important field.

  <H2>Global co-operation in nuclear fusion:
  <BR>
  Record of steady progress</H2>
  <P>
  <I>Working together to pool resources and expertise, countries
are moving ahead to design an
  experimental fusion reactor</I>
  <P>
  <B><A HREF="#author_d">by T.J. Dolan, D.P. Jackson, B.A.
Kouvshinnikov, and D.L.
  Banner</A></B>
  <P>
  <HR>
  <P>
  Enough potential energy is locked in the earth's oceans to last
millions of years. Their waters contain
  deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen and the main fuel for a
nuclear fusion reactor. Once extracted,
  the deuterium from just one litre of water could generate as
much energy as the combustion of 300
  litres of gasoline.
  <P>
  While it will take decades for the potential to become reality,
important strides already have been
  made. Technological and scientific advances today are bringing
the technology of nuclear fusion closer
  to demonstration. To a large extent, the progress in fusion
research and development is driven by the
  world's growing energy needs, environmental concerns, and
population trends.
  <P>
  Burning fossil fuels for energy and electricity production has
its limits. Four factors in particular limit
  utilization:
  <UL>
  <LI>the human health effects of fossil fuel combustion
(emphysema, cancer)
  <LI>the environmental effects (acid rain, greenhouse effect,
etc.)
  <LI>the need to save hydrocarbons for convenient fuels and
chemical feedstocks
  <LI>the finite reserves of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural
gas).
  </UL>
  <P>
  In estimating global energy supplies, the World Resources
Institute (WRI) has placed the world's total
  proven energy <I>reserves</I> at about 3.5x10<SUP>22</SUP>
joules (J). Of the total,
  proven coal <I>reserves</I> are estimated to be about
2.44x10<SUP>22</SUP> J; proven oil
  reserves about 0.56x10<SUP>22</SUP> J; and proven natural gas
reserves about
  0.50x10<SUP>22</SUP> J.
  <P>
  There are additional fossil fuels available called
<I>resources.</I> They are more difficult to
  recover, however. Consequently their price will escalate
significantly during the transition from the use
  of <I>reserves</I> to the use of <I>resources.</I>
  <P> 
  In 1994, the world's rate of primary energy consumption was
about 11.6 terawatts (TW), about 87% of
  which was from fossil fuels. At that rate of consumption, the
world's fossil fuel reserves would last
  about 120 year. However, in spite of effective conservation
measures, the energy consumption rate is
  growing, as developing nations improve their standards of
living. At a growth rate of 2% in energy
  consumption per year, these reserves would last only 61 years.
  <P>
  In the coming decades, many new power plants will be required
to increase the total capacity for
  meeting electricity demands, to replace ageing power plants,
and to replace fossil fuel plants for
  reasons related to environmental, health, and cost concerns.
Even under the most optimistic scenarios,
  researchers have projected a shortfall in energy supply by the
year 2030 exceeding 5 TW. This is a
  staggering amount equivalent to 5000 power plants, each capable
of generating 1000  megawatts of
  electricity. Major non-fossil sources of energy must be
developed and deployed to provide more than
  10% of the world's energy within the next 40 years.<A
HREF="#notea">*</A>
  <P> 
  Most renewable energy sources   although making valuable
contributions in specific situations   will
  be inadequate to produce the large quantities of electric power
required. Three sources, however, can
  potentially meet world needs: solar, fission, and fusion. Each
has advantages and disadvantages. 
  <P>
  Solar energy is diffuse, intermittent, and not suitable for use
in some climates, and it is usually
  expensive. Fission breeder reactors could extend the world's
supply of fissile fuels, but they are not
  universally welcomed by the public. Fusion reactors could have
many desirable features, but much
  more work is needed to bring them to fruition. If fusion
reactors are successfully developed, as many
  believe they will be, they could significantly brighten the
world's energy picture. <I>(See <A
  HREF="#box">box.</A>)</I>
  <P>
  It is also possible to develop a hybrid fusion-fission reactor
by putting uranium in the blanket of a
  fusion reactor, in order to boost the power output and breed
fissile fuel. Such a hybrid reactor could
  have economic advantages, but it would be more difficult to
license because of safety, environmental,
  and security concerns.
  <P>
  The world needs to pursue nuclear power vigorously, to
facilitate both the deployment of advanced
  fission reactors and then fusion reactors before shortages of
fossil fuels cause an escalation of fuel
  prices. Moreover, the nuclear options will have an essential
role in counteracting the threat of global
  climate change that is increasingly being recognized as a
consequence of the use of fossil fuels. Fission
  power already is partially replacing some carbon-based fuels,
and in the future fusion power could be
  even more attractive. For these reasons, fusion research and
development is carried out worldwide in
  some 40 Member States of the IAEA. The work includes fusion
safety studies to ensure that the
  potential safety and environmental advantages of fusion power
will be realized.
  <P>
  For many reasons, global co-operation has characterized the
research and development of nuclear
  fusion.  The collaboration has moved from small experiments to
the design of a large thermonuclear
  reactor.  This article presents an overview of co-operative
efforts and updates the status of current
  work.
  <P>
  <H3>A history of international co-operation</H3>
  <P>
  There are several reasons why global co-operation has been
particularly valuable in fusion research. 
  They include the need to pool expertise and share the cost of
large projects; the desire to speed
  progress by sharing knowledge of plasma theory, experimental
results, computer codes, materials
  properties, and technology developments; and the desire to help
developing countries build up expertise
  in fusion physics and technology.
   <P>
  In the 1950s, nuclear fusion experiments were small, employed a
few people, and cost on the order of
  a million US dollars. Nowadays, some of the experiments are
much larger, they employ hundreds of
  highly-skilled people (who might not all be available in one
country), and they can cost billions of
  dollars. There are also many small- and medium-scale fusion
experiments that provide valuable
  contributions to the worldwide effort.
  <P>
  Nevertheless, because of the potential importance of fusion
power in the future, countries also require
  strong domestic fusion programmes, so that the science and
technology results flowing from
  international collaboration can be applied at home. While most
fusion research is at a pre-competitive
  stage, there are technical areas where the protection of
intellectual property of contributing countries is
  necessary, and this requirement must be respected in
establishing collaborative arrangements. There is
  also some concern about sharing technology that could have
possible military applications, such as
  inertial confinement fusion.
  <P>
  In the early 1950s nuclear fusion research began independently
in several countries, cloaked in military
  secrecy. Magnetic pinches, mirrors, and toroidal devices were
studied, and some neutrons were
  observed. There was optimism of  fusion power within 20 years. 
Then the initial optimism was
  tempered by the realization that the neutrons were not from
thermonuclear reactions and that plasma
  instabilities were spoiling confinement. A better understanding
of plasma behaviour would be required,
  and could be facilitated by sharing results with other
countries. 
  <P>
  The Soviet Union led the way in 1956 by sharing its fusion
research results with Western countries.
  The first major international co-operation occurred at the
Geneva Conference on Peaceful Uses of
  Atomic Energy in 1958. In that same year, the IAEA began its
operations. The first IAEA Conference
  on Plasma Physics and Controlled Thermonuclear Research was
held in Salzburg in 1961, and today
  this meeting (now renamed the  IAEA Fusion Energy Conference )
is held at 2-year intervals. In
  1972, the IAEA established the International Fusion Research
Council (IFRC), which advises the
  Agency on its wide scope of fusion research activities. 
  <P>
  In parallel with the Agency's activities, many bilateral and
multilateral agreements for collaboration in
  fusion research have developed among countries over the years.
Historically, such agreements were
  often the first steps in bringing new players into
international fusion co-operative work. In other cases,
  they have proved particularly useful when a high level of
mutual collaboration is envisaged in specific
  work areas. Examples of such collaboration are the
participation of Japan in the US Tritium Systems
  Test Assembly and Doublet-III projects, and the participation
of Canada in ITER through agreements
  with the European Union. 
  <P>
  The International Energy Agency (IEA), part of the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and
  Development, was formed by the Western industrialized countries
in the 1970s as a response to the oil
  price shocks of 1973. The IEA covers all areas of energy R&D
including fusion, while its sister
  organization, the Nuclear Energy Agency, covers areas of
fission. 
  <P>
  IEA collaboration is organized by means of implementing
agreements with annexes referring to specific
  work areas. In principle, any IEA member country can
participate in any of these agreements by
  sharing in associated costs as a Contracting Party; other,
non-member countries can now also join as
  Associate Contracting Parties, as Russia has done with a number
of the fusion agreements. Currently,
  there are active implementing agreements covering large
tokamaks; TEXTOR; ASDEX-upgrade;
  stellarators; reversed field pinches; fusion materials; fusion
nuclear technology; and the environmental,
  safety and economic aspects of fusion power.
  <P>
  These activities are overseen by the Fusion Power Co-ordinating
Committee, which is the IEA
  counterpart of the IFRC, and the two committees have several
members in common. In recent years
  increasing efforts have been made through these oversight
committees to co-ordinate the fusion
  activities of the two agencies, in order to avoid overlap and
duplication. 
  <P>
  <H3>Origins of the ITER project </H3>
  <P>
  In 1978, the IAEA organized the International Tokamak Reactor
(INTOR) workshop to define the next
  major experimental tokamak, as recommended by the IFRC. This
work assembled information on
  plasma behaviour, cross sections, and materials properties,
produced a reference reactor design, and
  defined the key issues to be resolved. The results were
documented in a series of IAEA reports issued
  from 1982-88. 
  <P>
  The success of INTOR in demonstrating the feasibility of
sustained technical collaboration was one
  factor that influenced the subsequent establishment of the
International Thermonuclear Experimental
  Reactor (ITER) project.  An additional factor was the G-7
  ( Western Economic Summit ) meetings that had identified fusion
as one of the areas with potential for
  increased economic growth by mutual co-operation. These and
other factors provided a fertile
  background to the immediate political impetus for the ITER
project, which was proposed by General
  Secretary Gorbachev (USSR) to President Mitterand (France), and
then to President Reagan (USA) at
  their 1985 Geneva Summit Meeting. 
  <P>
  Ultimately, in 1988, the ITER Conceptual Design Activity (CDA)
was launched by four Parties: the
  European Community, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the USA, which
all have major fusion research
  programmes. After completing the CDA, the four Parties agreed
to proceed with the Engineering
  Design Activity (EDA) from 1992-98. 
  <P>
  The Agency played a crucial enabling role in the inception of
ITER, and it now provides the auspices
  for the four-Party collaboaration and certain facilitations,
including administration of the ITER joint
  funds and co-ordination with pertinent technical work conducted
by the Agency's Nuclear Data Section.
  <P>
  <H3>IAEA fusion-related activities</H3>
  <P>
  In addition to providing support to ITER, the IAEA has a
variety of other activities that promote the
  development of international collaboration in nuclear fusion
research. <I>(See <A
  HREF="#box2">box page 21.</A>)</I> In essence, the IAEA is a
major focal point for such
  multinational collaboration in fusion research.
  <P> 
  The monthly journal <I>Nuclear Fusion</I> has been published
since September 1960. The
  Agency's biennial conference, which covers a broad spectrum of
topics in fusion research, typically has
  about 500 attendees. The IAEA Nuclear Data Section staff update
the data libraries, distribute the new
  information to researchers around the world, and plan research
to fill gaps in existing knowledge. The
  Atomic & Molecular and Plasma-Material Interaction data
collected and evaluated by the IAEA are
  especially useful to the ITER project. 
  <P>
  The IFRC provides liaison with member states, contacts with
experts in various fusion research
  specialities, and guidance on planning the IAEA fusion research
activities. The IFRC members are
  appointed by the IAEA Director General.
  <P>
  Some technical committee meetings are held annually, such as
the one on research using small
  tokamaks. Others are held every two or three years, such as
those on fusion reactor design and on
  fusion safety.  Held less frequently are some technical
committee meetings, as well as advisory group
  meetings, such as those on alpha particle physics and on H-mode
physics.
  <P>
  Co-ordinated Research Programmes (CRP), which may last two to
five years, lead to scientific reports
  summarizing the status of research in a particular field. There
are usually several fusion-related CRPs
  in progress, each with five to 10 participants from both
developed and developing Member States. The
  Agency's technical co-operation program further includes
activities such as fellowships for scientists
  from developing countries to work in major laboratories. More
requests are being sought from IAEA
  Member States to more fully make use of this programme in the
fusion research field. 
  <P>
  <H3> Status of the ITER engineering design</H3>
  <P>
  ITER's work and Joint Central Team (JCT) are spread among three
electronically-connected Joint
  Working Sites: Garching, Germany, in the European Union
(in-vessel components); Naka, in Ibaraki
  Prefecture, Japan (ex-vessel components); and San Diego,
California, in the USA (design integration,
  environment, safety, and health). The formal seat of the
supervisory ITER Council is in Moscow,
  Russia.
  <P>
  In addition, each of the four Parties has a Home Team that
contributes to the design effort and
  undertakes the associated R&D tasks. The ITER Council,
consisting of two representatives from each
  of the four Parties, governs the project and appoints the ITER
Director, who manages the project. A
  Technical Advisory Committee, consisting of four leading
scientific and technical persons from each
  party designated by the ITER Council, provides advice to the
Council on all technical matters requested
  by the Council. A Management Advisory Committee, having three
representatives designated by each
  Party, provides advice to the Council on management and
administrative matters. This system, although
  complicated and spread around the globe, is working well.
  <P>
  The six-year ITER Engineering Design Activity involves
<I>design</I> work with a total
  professional manpower of 1340 person-years plus basic
technology and specific engineering research
  and development totaling US $750 million (in 1989 US dollars).
The <I>ITER Interim Design Report,
  Cost Review and Safety Analysis</I> was prepared by the ITER
JCT and accepted in July 1995 by
  the ITER Council for consideration by the ITER Parties. This
report is supported by detailed technical
  documentation: the <I>Interim Design Report</I> and <I>Design
Description Documents</I>
  totalling about 4350 pages and 1400 drawings. 
  <P>
  In the early Spring of 1996 the IAEA will issue the <M>Interim
Design Report as a separate technical
  publication in the ITER Documentation Series. There is good
progress towards resolution of most of
  the technical issues. 
  <P>
  The construction phase of ITER is estimated to take about 10
years from the construction decision to
  the first plasma. 
  <P>
  <H3>Prospects for future collaboration</H3>
  <P>
  In the field of nuclear fusion, there will still be major
research projects conducted primarily by one
  party, but even those projects will employ some experts from
other countries. Researchers around the
  world have learned to respect each other's unique skills and to
appreciate the value of exchanging
  viewpoints. The ITER project has achieved great strides in
international collaboration, demonstrating
  that the problems created by national interests and pride,
geographical separation of research teams,
  and cultural differences can be successfully overcome. Thus,
the ITER experience in the management
  of a large, multinational project could also be helpful to
other projects in the future.
  <P>
  Since other potential new fusion devices, such as a 14-MeV
neutron source for materials testing and a
  tokamak Demonstration Reactor, will be very expensive, it is
probable those projects will also seek
  joint funding from several parties. Because of the worldwide
political pressures to cut budgets, cost-
  sharing is encouraged for large fusion research projects. 
  <P>
  Another beneficial aspect of international collaboration is the
potential for increased participation in
  major projects by innovative scientists from developing
countries. Bringing these scientists together to
  participate in a laboratory can serve to speed up progress in
fusion research, in addition to helping the
  developing countries.
  <P>
  Industrial applications of plasmas are being commercialized
around the world. These applications
  include plasma spray coatings, surface modification, synthesis
of new materials, chemical reaction
  enhancement, and processing of chemical contaminants. The IAEA
is starting a CRP  to promote
  collaboration in this area. 
  <P>
  The needs of the world fusion research programme include
completion of the ITER project; an inertial
  fusion energy ignition experiment; alternative fusion concept
research; development of fusion reactor
  materials (a powerful neutron source is required for
irradiation testing); a strong plasma theory and
  simulation programme; and support for university research and
graduate student education in plasma
  sciences and fusion technology.  International collaboration
can help fulfill most of these needs more
  efficiently than individual countries can on their own.
  <P>
  In summary, the world needs nuclear fusion research to provide
a complementary energy source to
  solar energy and nuclear fission reactors. International
collaboration can pool expertise and share the
  cost of large projects; accelerate progress by sharing
knowledge; and help developing countries build
  their infrastructure in plasma sciences and fusion technology.
  <P>
   The IAEA, the IEA, and various bilateral agreements promote
such collaboration. The IAEA is
  conducting a broad scope of activities, including its monthly
journal; the biennial conference; atomic,
  molecular, and plasma-material-interaction data coordination;
technical committee meetings; and Co-
  ordinated Research Programmes. 
  <P>
  Over the past half century, the worldwide nuclear fusion
research programme   from the first Soviet
  initiative through the IAEA activities to the ITER EDA   has
become a premier example of scientific
  co-operation. It should serve to benefit all people, if fusion
power plants are deployed to help meet the
  world's energy and electricity needs.

  <H3>Potential Positive Characteristics of Fusion Power</H3>
  <P>
  In terms of many energy and environmental issues, nuclear
fusion has a number of attractive
  characteristics:
  <P>
  <B>Fuel supply:</B> Deuterium extraction from water without
harmful by-products; available
  inexpensive to all countries.  Enough deuterium in oceans to
last millions of years.
  <P>
  <B>Mining:</B> Limited mining of lithium, used to breed tritium
for fusion reactors. (Seawater
  also contains 0.17 ppm lithium.)
  <P>
  <B>Environmental issues:</B> Fusion is environmentally safe.
  <P>
  <B>Nuclear weapons proliferation:</B> No plutonium or uranium
present.
  <P>
  <B>Safety:</B> The amount of fuel in the plasma is so small
that even compete burnup would not
  cause an explosion.  Heat removal is not difficult because of
low level of decay heat, spread over a
  large volume.  Tritium inventory can be minimized by careful
design.  Potential off-site radiation dose
  during accidents may be low enough that no evacuation plans are
required.
  <P>
  <B>Radioactive by-products:</B> Generation of long-lived
radioactivity in the structure can be
  minimized by careful choice of materials.  The vanadium alloy,
lithium coolant, and unburned
  deuterium-tritium fuel could be recycled.

<HR>
<P>
For some decades, people have looked to the process powering the
sun   nuclear fusion   as an answer to energy problems on Earth.
Whether nuclear fusion can meet our expectations remains to be
seen: technological problems facing a fusion power plant designer
are complex and a fusion power plant has not yet been built.
Remarkable progress has been made, however, toward realizing
fusion's potential.
<P>Research in fields of nuclear fusion has been pursued in
various
countries for decades. The efforts include the JT-60, which has
provided important results for improving plasma confinement; the
D-IIID tokamak experiment, which  has achieved record values of
plasma pressure relative to the magnetic field pressure; and the
Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR), which has generated 10
million
Watts of thermal power from fusion. The Joint European Torus
(JET)
is expected to approach breakeven conditions, where the fusion
power generated exceeds the input power. Unresolved physics
issues,
such as plasma purity, disruptions, and sustainment of current,
should be resolved by the International Thermonuclear
Experimental
Reactor (ITER), which is being designed by experts of the
European
Community, Japan, Russian Federation, and the United States.
<I>(See related <A HREF="dolan.html">article.</A>)</I>
<P>There is confidence that the engineering design issues  
including those concerning superconducting magnets, vacuum
systems,
cryogenic systems, plasma heating systems, plasma diagnostic
systems, and blanket cooling systems   can eventually be solved.
Other important aspects in designing a fusion power plant relate
to
safety and economics. This article looks at safety aspects of
fusion power plant designs, and reviews efforts in safety-related
areas that are being made through international co-operative
activities.
<P>
<H3>Safety-related goals and considerations</H3>
<P>
Reliable predictions of the cost of electricity from fusion power
cannot be performed until design details of commercial fusion
power
plants have been established. Currently, this cost is not
projected
to be significantly less than the costs of other energy sources. 
<P>
In areas of safety, however, fusion holds potential advantages
over
other energy sources. In nearly all studies related to the design
of a fusion power plant, safety and environmental considerations
are being increasingly emphasized, and safety goals for fusion
have
been extensively discussed. The safety and environmental goals of
a fusion power plant design are to protect workers from
radiation,
electromagnetic fields, and other hazards; the public from
radioactive and toxic materials; the environment from pollutants
and waste; and the investor from damage by accidents.
<P>
<B>The fusion process</B>. At sufficiently high temperature,
nearly
all light nuclei undergo fusion reactions and could in principle
be
used to fuel a fusion power plant. However, technical
difficulties
increase rapidly with the nuclear charge of the reacting
isotopes.
For this reason, only deuterium, tritium and isotopes of helium,
lithium, and boron have been proposed in practice. 
<P>
The first generation of fusion power plants will very likely use
deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel because it is the easiest to ignite.
The main reaction product, helium-4, does not pose a health
hazard.
The principal energy output from a DT fusion event is a 14 MeV
neutron. Nearly all materials become activated to some degree by
energetic neutron bombardment. Neutron reactions in DT fusion
reactors will inevitably create radioisotopes. The principal
radioactive materials present in a DT fusion reactor will
therefore
be tritium and neutron-activated structural materials surrounding
the reaction volume. 
<P>
<B>Safety-related considerations</B>. Specific fusion power plant
safety studies, which are complementary to many other safety
studies, include those related to tritium safety, the
assessment of tritium releases, activation product safety,
radioactive waste disposal, and analyses of potential accidents
and
their consequences. 
<P>
The release rate of tritium during plant operation has to be kept
well within an acceptable safe range. This release of tritium is
modeled by computer codes that account for tritium permeation
through the materials present in the power plant. Major tritium
research laboratories are in Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Russian Federation, and the United States.
<P>
The generation of neutron activation products is not a serious
problem if they can be contained and if they have short
half-lives.
They are a byproduct of the fusion reaction, not a direct
reaction
product. Therefore, their generation in the blanket and structure
of the reactor is under the control of the designer and can be
minimized by proper design and appropriate choice of materials.
The
use of a variety of low activation materials is being extensively
studied.
<P>
There is no potential for a runaway fusion reaction; indeed, the
problem is making the fusion reaction proceed adequately at all.
Virtually all hardware problems lead to fusion shutdown, and
there
are inherent limits in any case because of the limited amount of
fusion fuel present and the nature of the fusion reaction.
However,
a particular focus of work in fusion safety is the analysis of
various other potential accidents, such as magnet accidents, and
 consequence calculations  are performed. For categorization of
accidents into event groupings and estimation of the frequency of
accidents, specific component reliability data are required.
<P>
The approach for conducting a general safety analysis for fusion
plants is similar to that used for the design of other large
nuclear installations. <I>(See <A HREF="#box">box</A>) </I> The
results of safety analyses indicate that fusion power plants can
meet the desired safety goals. For example, the <I>ESECOM</I>
study
compared the safety and economic aspects of many fusion reactor
designs.<A HREF="#note">*</A> The general safety issues of ITER
were discussed and a draft report has been issued giving
preliminary results of the ITER safety analysis.
<P>
Fusion power plant safety studies have been evolving for more
than
20 years. They are steadily adapting to the evolution of
internationally agreed radiation safety concepts and
requirements.
<P>
In 1994 the IAEA, jointly with five other international
organizations issued revised <I>International Basic Safety
Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the
Safety of Radiation Sources</I>. The Basic Safety Standards  
issued jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
International Labour Office (ILO), Nuclear Energy Agency of the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD/NEA),
Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), and World Health
Organization (WHO)   take account of new recommendations on
radiation protection of the International Commission on
Radiological Protection (ICRP). A central part of the dose
limitation system is the  optimization of protection  principle.
Fusion is a good candidate for the successful application of this
principle. Optimization is best achieved when safety assessment
is
already built  into the early design stages of a project.
<P>
As pointed out earlier, the first fusion power plants will most
likely use the DT fuel cycle. Once a fusion power plant based on
the DT reaction has been built, advanced fuels could be further
pursued for energy exploitation. This would bring about a lower
tritium inventory. Later fusion power plants may evolve to fuels
(such as deuterium + <SUP>3</SUP>helium) that generate fewer
neutrons, and hence produce less radioactivity in surrounding
materials. Thus, during the evolution to advanced fuel cycles,
the
safety advantages of fusion may increase with time. It may be
possible in the future to design power plants with low enough
radionuclide inventories so that emergency planning and
preparedness are unnecessary.
<P>
<H3>Practical realization of fusion</H3>
<P>
It has been estimated that an investment of the order of US
$50-100
billion is needed to bring fusion power to fruition. The rate of
progress in fusion research is limited by the funding rate, which
is estimated to be about US $1.5 billion per year worldwide. 
<P>
Currently, expectations are that ITER could begin significant DT
operation around 2005-2010, followed by construction of a
demonstration power plant. A demonstration fusion power plant
could
then begin operation about two decades later. If the
demonstration
reactor is successful, i.e. if sufficient operational experience
warrants financing of a commercial power plant, then early
commercial fusion power plants could begin operation by about
2050.
<P>
This estimated timetable could be delayed or accelerated. It
could
be delayed by funding shortages or by unforeseen difficulties
with
plasma phenomena or technology. The schedule could be accelerated
by a breakthrough in understanding of plasma behavior (such as,
perhaps, the recent success with the  reversed shear mode  of
tokamak operation), by a new invention that enhances plasma
confinement, and by providing an increased funding rate. 
<P>
Non-tokamak types of plasma confinement are also being studied,
to
develop reactors that can produce electricity at a lower cost.
For
example, large stellarator experiments are under construction in
Japan and Europe. It is clear that safety studies will play a
major
role in earning and keeping public trust, desire, and acceptance
of
fusion power.
<P>
<A HREF="#insert">
<H3>IAEA activities in fusion safety</H3></A>
<P>
Guided by the International Fusion Research Council (IFRC), the
IAEA is conducting a range of activities that promote
international
co-operation and help to enhance the safety and environmental
advantages of fusion power. They include supporting the ITER
project, whose  Engineering Design Activity has passed the
halfway
point. The ITER experiment will have safety built into the
design,
to ensure that no fatalities can arise during a serious accident
by
release of radioisotopes. In 1995, the Agency published a
discussion of safety in inertial fusion reactors.
<P>
Many IAEA activities in the area of radiation safety are relevant
to fusion safety. They cover topics such as safety standards for
radiation protection, safe transport of radioactive materials and
management of radioactive waste, guidelines for safe handling of
tritium, and limitation of radioactivity releases into the
environment.
<P>
Since 1973, fusion safety has been a special item on the Agency's
agenda of safety activities. Over the past two decades, the
Agency
has organized several technical committee meetings on fusion
safety
which discussed progress, research needs, and future plans.
Typically about 50 experts from a dozen Member States have
attended
these meetings, which were held about every three to four years.
The proceedings of the latest meeting in this series, held in
1993
in Toronto, Canada, were published in the <I>Journal of Fusion
Energy</I> in June 1993. The next meeting is planned in October
1996 in Japan.
<P>
<H3>Prospects and future directions</H3>
<P>
Fusion reactors have a significant potential for safe,
environmentally benign operation. Safety aspects of fusion power
plants, which have been designed on paper, cannot yet readily be
compared with safety aspects of fission power reactors or other
operating energy sources. In fusion, the bulk of radioactive
material is a secondary product resulting from neutron
activation,
leaving room for optimization of protection through materials
development and selection, or by using advanced fuels. 
<P>
To ensure that the potential safety and environmental advantages
of
fusion can eventually be utilized, safety engineering must be
integrated into fusion reactor designs. This is being done by the
ITER Project, although ITER is an advanced experimental fusion
reactor and should not be viewed as a prototype fusion power
reactor. 
<P>
As fusion safety studies progress, more and more
interdisciplinary
work will be required. Over the long term one can confidently
expect that safety will be strengthened as progress is made in
fusion power plant design. A statement made by C.M. Braams,
Chairman of the IFRC, 20 years ago in an introductory note to a
review elaborated at that time, remains valid today: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
 ... although the prospects for taking advantage of the
environmental merits of fusion are good, it is clear that fusion
reactors, if they become a reality, will have an environmental
impact - including radiation hazards - whose magnitude will
depend
on the progress of research, on the availability of materials and
on how much society is prepared to spend on minimizing the
impact .</I>

<H3>Fusion Safety Analysis</H3>
<P>
As in safety studies of other large nuclear installations,
various
steps are involved in accident analysis of a fusion power plant.
<P>
Each sequence of events may be represented by an "event tree",
and
each branch of the tree has an associated probability of
occurrence.  For example, if a valve is ordered to close, it has
a
finite probability of failing to do so.  for loss-of-coolant and
loss-of-flow events, the temperature rise in the first wall and
blanket must be calculated as functions of time.  Then the
mobilization of various elements can be estimated, based upon
data
from laboratory tests.
<P>
The amount of a radioisotope that is mobilized during an accident
constitutes the "source term".  Sometimes the source consists of
an
oxide aerosol, of which most would plate out inside the building.
During a severe accident with damage to the containment, a
fraction
of the aerosol might leak out of the containment to the
atmosphere. 
Sophisticated computer codes are used to model:
<UL>
<LI>neutron and gamma ray transport in the first wall, blanket,
and
shield;
<LI>generation of radioisotopes by neutron absorption;
<LI>temperature rise due to afterheat and chemical reactions
during
accidents;
<LI>mobilization of radioisotopes during accidents;
<LI>transport of aerosols inside the confinement building (and
reaction released);
<LI>transport of released particles and gases to the site
boundary;
<LI>radiation dose to the "maximum exposed individual" at the
site
boundary.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="insert">
<HR>
<P>
<H3>Fusion Safety Philosophy</H3>
<P>
The fusion safety philosophy now includes the following concepts:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>passive systems and inherent safety features;
<LI>fail-safe design;
<LI>reliability (including redundancy of components (pumps,
valves,
etc.); diversity (such as two different ways of supplying back-up
power); independence (if one component or system fails, it does
not
cause an adjacent one to fail); simplicity; and surveillance, to
detect flawed components before an accident occurs);
<LI>consideration of human factors;
<LI>remote maintenance capability;
<LI>safety culture in worker attitudes;
<LI>quality assurance (including codes and standards;
verification
and validation; and safety analysis);
<LI>operational controls (fault detection, automatic corrective
response);
<LI>safety systems to reduce consequences of failures;
<LI>accident preparedness and management, to preserve confinement
integrity;
<LI>emergency planning to mitigate effects of radioactive
releases,
if needed.

<H2>Radioactive waste management: <BR>International peer reviews
</H2>
<P>
<I>Countries are evaluating their programmes through the IAEA's
Waste Management Assessment and Technical Review service</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author_b">by Ernst Warnecke and Arnold Bonne</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
International peer reviews have become a central feature of the
IAEA's safety-related services.  In areas of radioactive waste
management, they are gaining greater attention among countries as
an effective tool for objective technical feedback and
assessment.
<P>
The Agency's peer review service for radioactive waste management
  known as the Waste Management Assessment and Technical Review
Programme (WATRP)   started in 1989, building upon earlier types
of
advisory programmes. WATRP's international experts today provide
advice and guidance on proposed or ongoing radioactive waste
management programmes; planning, operation, or decommissioning of
waste facilities; or on legislative, organizational, and
regulatory
matters. Specific topics often cover waste conditioning, storage,
and disposal concepts or facilities; or technical and other
aspects
of ongoing or planned research and development programmes. The
missions can thus contribute to improving waste management
systems
and plans, and in raising levels of public confidence in them, as
part of IAEA efforts to assist countries in the safe management
of
radioactive wastes.
<P>
This article presents a brief overview of recent WATRP missions
and
the review process itself. <I>(See <A HREF="#box_1">box.</A>)</I>
<P>
<A HREF="#box_2"><H3>Recent peer reviews</H3></A>
<P>
<B>Norway.</B> In December 1994, the Norwegian Radiation
Protection
Authority requested a WATRP review of its work toward
establishing
a combined storage/disposal facility for low- and
intermediate-level waste. The mission's main objective was to
review safety-related aspects of the approach to the selection of
the site, the technical concept, and the long-term safety of the
facility.
<P>
A team of five experts from Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland,
and the United States was formed to conduct this review. The team
received background documents in June and July 1995. After
reviewing the documents, the team prepared a questionnaire for
the
Norwegian experts in advance of a review meeting with them during
the last week of September 1995. The team's final report has been
prepared and submitted to the Norwegian Radiation Protection
Authority.
<P>
The team found that the legal system and the licensing process as
they are applied to the projected facility correspond to
international standards. The criteria which have been applied for
the selection of the site for the planned facility are
comprehensive and consider the important factors for both
environmental protection and long-term safety.
<P>
The team recommended that it would now be important to select a
final design for the facility and to develop the detailed plans.
These plans should also address the later conversion of the
storage
part of the facility into a repository for the plutonium-bearing
waste or the removal of this waste from the facility.
<P>
<B>Slovak Republic.</B> In December 1993, the Nuclear Regulatory
Authority of the Slovak Republic requested a review of the
Mochovce
disposal facility for short-lived low- and intermediate-level
radioactive waste. As requested, the review's scope was limited
to
parts of Slovakia's Pre-operational Safety Report that are
related
to the evaluation of the facility's safety. The team's work was
based on written material provided, discussions with Slovak
experts
and their consultants, and the evaluation of some of the archived
design and construction records.
<P>
Five experts from Canada, Finland, France, Germany and Spain
conducted the review. The team's review meeting was held in May
1994 with Slovak experts at the Mochovce nuclear power plant.
Slovak experts provided additional information on issues and
questions raised by the team, and arranged for a technical visit
to
the Mochovce  Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility.
<P>
The team considered the disposal facility's concept a good one.
It
recognized the various components of the total waste management
system that are important to ensuring safety. The team  noted,
however, that the degree of emphasis and safety assessment work
done on the various components of the repository varied
considerably.  Research now is being done to develop a
comprehensive and fully integrated approach for safety. The
desire
of both the regulator and the disposal facility operator to
benefit
from the expertise of other countries has been an important
element
towards achieving safety goals.
<P>
The review team encouraged authorities responsible for the
implementation of disposal at Mochovce to continue with their
programme to further refine safety aspects of the disposal
facility. Specific recommendations were detailed in the review
report, taking into consideration the limited information
reviewed.
The review and recommendations covered the legal framework and
waste disposal strategy; characterization and inventory of waste;
design, site characteristics and construction; operation, closure
and monitoring of the repository; performance assessment for the
operational and post-operational phases; waste acceptance
criteria;
and specific quality assurance issues.
<P>
<B>Czech Republic.</B> The WATRP review in the Czech Republic was
in response to a request in May 1993 from the State Office for
Nuclear Safety and focused on the programme for the development
of
a deep geological repository. The main task was the assessment of
the study of required research and development for the programme,
which has been funded equally by the Czech and Slovak power
companies. This study is limited to the deep underground
geological
disposal of high-level and long-lived low- and intermediate-level
waste and described the planned technical programme for waste
disposal.
<P>
In view of the early stages of the country's plans for deep
geological disposal, the WATRP review was limited to considering
the general approach to the development of the planned repository
and did not include detailed critique of methodology and
experimental procedures. The review team of five experts from
France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States
evaluated documents supplied by the Czech Republic and held
discussions with Czech and Slovak scientists and engineers. The
mission also included a technical visit to the Litomerice-Richard
II facility for radioactive waste from institutional sources. 
<P>
The WATRP team made recommendations on the legal framework and
organizational structure for radioactive waste disposal in the
country, in particular the necessity for a definitive separation
between the operational and regulatory functions. It also
recommended that the responsibilities of the regulatory body, the
waste generators, and the operator of the disposal facility be
clearly defined; that a comprehensive set of regulations be
prepared to include clear guidance on the responsibilities and
limits of each party in the national high-level disposal
programme;
that the assignment of responsibilities for specific research and
development tasks should be considered a priority; and that a
clear
method of funding for the programme be determined.
<P>
The team's technical recommendations included the need to obtain
the maximum possible information from international experience,
particularly on the design of waste packages, the design of
geological repositories, underground test facilities, backfill
and
closure techniques, and the use and validation of computer codes
for safety assessments. It recommended that dose/risk criteria
appropriate to the chosen repository site be established in line
with international practice, and that the establishment and
implementation of a quality assurance programme  be given
priority
as an essential part of the regulatory framework. The team's
final
report, submitted to Czech authorities in 1994, further
highlighted
the need for public interaction and involvement in the
development
and licensing of the waste repository.
<P>
<B>Finland.</B> The Finnish nuclear waste management programme
was
reviewed following a request in November 1992 from the Finnish
Ministry of Trade and Industry. The mission principally addressed
the work being done to site and build an encapsulation facility
for
spent nuclear fuel, and a repository to be located on the same
site. The review also covered the plans and activities for
conditioning and disposal of the low- and intermediate-level
waste
from Finland's nuclear power plants; and the plans for
decommissioning Finland's reactors when that becomes necessary.
<P>
Four experts from Canada, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland
carried
out the WATRP review. During the early summer of 1993, they
reviewed a large amount of documentation supplied by the Finnish
industry, government, and research organizations. In August 1993,
the team met in Helsinki for detailed discussions with staff of
several Finnish organizations involved in radioactive waste
management. The  meeting included a site visit to Olkiluoto,
where
two of Finland's four nuclear power plants are located and the
repository for shortlived low- and intermediate-level waste
(LILW)
is in operation. Finland is among several countries studying
sites
for geological repositories, and its efforts, relating to the
LILW
repository were profiled in the <A HREF="#year"><I>IAEA Yearbook
for 1992.</A></I>
<P>During the WATRP review of Finland's programme for high-level
waste disposal, the team was impressed with the high standard of
work being done in Finland, and urged its continuance. It noted
that although the Finnish nuclear power programme is younger than
those of many other countries, Finland has recorded notable
achievements in developing its technologies and capabilities for
radioactive waste management.
<P>
WATRP experts further noted that Finnish scientists actively
participate in many international working groups and committees,
both contributing to the international understanding of a
difficult subject and obtaining knowledge that they can apply to
their own national programme.
<P>
In some cases, the team recommended modifications to the
programme.
For example, it suggested that the full-scale steel/copper
canister
for the disposal of spent fuel be manufactured and tested so that
any difficulties in its manufacturing, loading, sealing, and
subsequent emplacement in the repository can be identified as
early
as possible in the programme. The team also recommended that the
Finnish regulatory body's resources should be at least maintained
and possibly increased; that work should proceed to produce
detailed regulations and guides on the criteria for obtaining
approval to dispose of spent fuel; and that the proposed
microbiological method of treatment of organic waste at the
Loviisa
nuclear power plant be tested at full scale as soon as possible
with a complete range of organic compounds.
<P>
In reviewing the methodology of the planned repository's
preliminary safety report, the team found it satisfactory. It
noted
that while some data was generic in nature, the final report
would
contain site-specific data. Overall, the team noted the
prodigious
amount of work performed within the site characterization
programme
and urged that the same effort and quality be continued.<A
HREF="#fin">**</A>
<P>
<H3>Benefitting from global peer reviews</H3>
<P>
As past experience has shown, issues of radioactive waste
management attract considerable attention, particularly from the
standpoint of safety of health and environmental safety. 
International peer reviews can be valuable components of national
efforts to obtain objective assessments of their programmes and
plans.
<P>
At the IAEA, the WATRP programme is one of a number of advisory
and
technical services through which countries can benefit from the
exchange of international experience in this important field. For
years ahead, the IAEA is working to promote international
co-operation for the safe and sound management of radioactive
waste
through its full range of programmes and services.

<H3>Overview of WATRP Review Process</H3>
<P>
WATRP's main objective is to provide IAEA Member States with an
independent international peer review of their radioactive waste
management programmes.  Reviews are made by teams of
international experts in the field.
<P>
Three principal elements are involved in the review process: a)
evaluation of technical documentation and other programme-related
material, b) technical discussions and exchange of information
with experts of the requesting Member State or organization, and
c) preparation of a report with the team's conclusions and
recommendations.  Reviews generally are tailored to the needs of
a particular country at its request, and they may include
technical visits to sites.  Requests from a Member State for a
WATRP review of its radioactive waste management programme must
be made in writing to the IAEA.
<P>
Once the review's scope and terms of reference are determined by
the requesting organization, the IAEA initiates the selection and
recruitment of international experts for the review team. 
Selected experts serve in their individual capacities and their
opinions are not necessarily those of their respective
governments or the Agency.  For each WATRP review a different
team is formed.  The size and expertise of the team depends on
the scope of the review and subject areas to be covered. 
Normally, the WATRP team is composed of five experts, though
particular requests for investigations of specific areas in
greater depth or of many issues may require a larger team.  The
Agency selects a WATRP team leader from among the experts who is
responsible for the co-ordination and liaison with other team
members, as well as for conducting the WATRP review meeting and
drafting the final report.  Also on the team is an IAEA staff
member from the Agency's Waste Management Section, who provides
overall assistance and guidance.
<P>
Before the mission takes place in the requesting country, team
experts review technical documentation and materials about the
country's waste management programme.  From their evaluation of
this information, the team prepares a questionnaire that details
areas requiring clarification.  Once finalized, the questionnaire
is sent to the national counterpart in the requesting country
before the actual review meeting takes place.
<P>
Using the questionnaire and the country's response to it as a
basis, the WATRP review meeting, typically one week long, focuses
on any open questions, and on discussions of the team's findings
and recommendations.  Normally attending the review meetings
along with the WATRP team members are national representatives
from the requesting country or organizations and representatives
of firms or organizations responsible for particular technical
documentation submitted for review and related research and
development activities.  Following the meeting, the WATRP team
completes its final report, which is submitted through the IAEA
to the national organization requesting the review.  The report
is the property of the requesting organization, for use at its
own discretion.

<H2>Radioactive waste disposal: <BR>Radiological principles and

<P>
<I>An overview of national and international efforts to establish
criteria for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level
waste</I>
<P>
<B><A HREF="#author_c">by Dr. J.O. Snihs</A></B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The first large-scale geological repositories for the final
disposal of spent fuel from nuclear plants are not expected to be
in operation until well into the next century. Such repositories
will demand high levels of safety to protect  the environment and
the public from potential radiological risks.
<P>
While national policies differ in classifying spent fuel as a
waste
product or as a resource for recycling fuel, the safety of spent
fuel storage and radioactive waste disposal has been extensively
studied at the national and international levels. The work
includes
criteria developed by Nordic countries in 1989 and subsequently
revised and published in 1993. This article briefly reviews these
criteria in the context of international and national studies on
the disposal of high-level waste including spent fuel.
<P>
<H3>Major national and international reports</H3>
<P>
In 1984, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for
Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD/NEA) published the report,
<I>Long-Term Radiation Protection Objectives for Radioactive
Waste
Disposal</I>.  It stands as one of the first international
reports
on the special problems connected with disposal of long-lived
radioactive waste. Among questions discussed in this report are
the
limitations of individual dose or risk, the application of
optimization of protection, and the use of collective dose for
future assessments.
<P>
In 1985, the International Commission on Radiological Protection
(ICRP) published <I>Radiation Protection Principles for Disposal
of
Solid Radioactive Waste</I> (ICRP publication 46). It discusses
the
concept of risk constraint for a source, probabilistic events,
and
uncertainties about the future. The principle of optimization
should be applied but it is only one input in the process of
deciding a strategy and option for waste management and disposal.
Particularly emphasized are ethical considerations in weighing
the
significance of future detriments.
<P>
The IAEA, already in 1983, published an advisory report on
criteria
for underground disposal of radioactive wastes (Safety Series No.
60). In 1989, it was followed by the publication<I> Safety
Principles and Technical Criteria for Underground Disposal of
High-level Wastes</I> (IAEA Safety Series No. 99). It took into
account recommendations and discussions in NEA and ICRP
publications. 
<P>
The IAEA Radioactive Waste Management Safety Standards (RADWASS)
programme started in 1991 and is aimed at establishing a coherent
and comprehensive set of principles and standards for the safe
management of waste and formulating the guidelines necessary for
their application. RADWASS publications will provide Member
States
with a comprehensive series of internationally agreed documents
that reflect an international consensus. Within the RADWASS
programme the following documents of relevance to waste
management
have been published:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The Principles of Radioactive Waste Management</I>, IAEA
Safety Series No. 111-F (1995);

<P>
The set of publications in the RADWASS programme is now being
reviewed to ensure a harmonized approach throughout the Safety
Series.
<P>
The IAEA is also supporting the work on drafting an international
convention on radioactive waste safety. Progress made so far is
encouraging and if the pace is maintained a draft convention
could
be finalized towards the end of 1996.
<P>
In the ICRP's new recommendations on radiological protection
(ICRP
Publication 60, 1990), radioactive waste problems are not
particularly addressed. However, in the general system of
radiological protection, the optimization of protection, as well
as
dose limits, now include the concept of potential exposure. It is
expressed as the likelihood of incurring exposures where these
are
not certain to be received. They should be kept as low as
reasonably achievable (ALARA). 
<P>
Another important publication on the development of criteria for
disposal of high-level waste is the proceedings of an NEA
workshop
in Paris. The report   <I>Disposal of High-Level Wastes,
Radiation
Protection and Safety Criteria,</I> published in 1991 by the NEA
in
Paris   features an informative overview of existing national and
international approaches to problems and the current status of
guidelines and criteria. In the report, collective dose or risk
limits are used more for comparison of repository design
alternatives. Among other points are the following: Individual
dose
limits or risk limits as safety indicators are generally in the
range of 0.1 to 1 mSv per year or l0<SUP>-6</SUP> to
10<SUP>-5</SUP> per year,  respectively. Optimization of
protection
is generally agreed as a principle but its application has to be
adapted to what is achievable in practice. A similar level of
safety should be provided for all future generations as that
provided for current generations. A special problem discussed in
the report is how to demonstrate compliance with safety criteria.
There is no straightforward answer to that question, which has to
do with an understanding of the whole waste disposal system.
High-quality and good engineering practice are needed throughout
the process, using validated models and site-specific data, and
appropriately selecting scenarios and scrutinizing uncertainties.
<P>
<B>National reports.</B> At the national level, there has been
considerable work as well. For instance, in a joint 1990
Swiss-Swedish report, <I>Regulatory Guidance for Radioactive
Waste
Disposal   An Advisory Document</I> (SKI Technical Report 90,
Stockholm), a number of  principles and problems are discussed.
It
addresses problems concerning uncertainties over long time
periods
and urges the validation of all models used for performance
assessments of assumed repository systems.
<P>
Other national documents include the<I> French Basic Safety
Rules</I> in 1991; a 1992 report by the National Radiological
Protection Board (NRPB) in the United Kingdom, <I>Radiological
Protection Objectives for Land-based Disposal of Solid
Radioactive
Wastes,</I> and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
regulations, <I>Environmental Radiation Protection</I>
<I>Standards
for Management and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-Level and
Transuranic Radioactive Waste</I>, published in the US <I>Federal
Register</I>  20 December 1993.)
<P>
In the French Rules, ALARA is applied as a principle in the
criteria for a repository. The individual dose equivalents are
limited to 0.25 mSv per year for extended exposure associated
with
events which are certain or highly probable. For a period of at
least 10 000 years, the stability of the geological barrier must
be
demonstrated. Beyond this time period, the quantitative
assessments
may be supplemented by more qualitative assessments. The risk
concept is introduced for potential exposure situations. 
<P>
In the NRPB's publication, it is recommended that future
populations shall have an equivalent protection as that for
populations today. Moreover, the radiological risk to a critical
group, attributable to a single waste disposal facility, shall
not
exceed the risk constraint of 1 in 100 000 per year, and the
ALARA
principle should be applied. However, if the individual risk to
an
average member of the critical group does not exceed a design
target of 1 in 1 million per year, then the ALARA principle would
be required only for the detailed design of the facility and not
in
comparison of various sites or options. Site-specific
calculations
relating to the biosphere and human behaviour should not continue
beyond about 10 000 years into the future. For times greater than
that, reference models of biosphere and human behaviour can be
used
in combination with constraints on radionuclide release rates
from
the geosphere.
<P>
The 1993 EPA regulations stipulate that disposal systems for
spent
nuclear fuel, high-level and transuranic waste will have to be
designed so that, 10 000 years after disposal, the undisturbed
performance of the system will not deliver an annual committed
effective dose of radionuclides greater than 15 mrem to any
individual in the accessible environment.
<P>
The EPA regulations took effect 19 January 1994. Under them, the
protection period has been lengthened from 1000 years to 10,000
years. The EPA noted that wastes placed in the disposal systems
will remain radioactive for thousands of years. Results of EPA
studies show that potential radionuclide releases resulting in
exposures to individuals would not occur until more than 1000
years
after disposal because of the containment capabilities of the
engineered barrier system.
<P>
The EPA regulations do not apply, however, to the Yucca Mountain
Site Characterization Project. The EPA will develop a separate
standard for the potential disposal of spent fuel and high-level
waste at Yucca Mountain, under the guidance of the National
Academy
of Sciences, as directed by a 1992 congressional mandate.
<P>
<B>The Nordic criteria.</B> In parallel with these national and
international developments, the Nordic countries developed
criteria
issued in 1989 and subsequently revised in 1993 after extensive
review by international and national experts, among others.
(<I>Disposal of High Level Waste   Consideration of Some Basic
Criteria, </I>the Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety
Authorities in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.)
<P>
They are in many parts very similar to those found in
international
and other national documents. This is not surprising, since
Nordic
specialists have taken active part in international work in this
field. The Nordic criteria include:
<UL>
<LI><B>General considerations and objectives.</B>
<BR>
<I>General objective:</I> The objectives of disposal of
high-level
waste shall be to protect human health and the environment and to
limit burdens placed on future generations.
<P>
<I>Objective 1 - Long-term safety</I>: The risk to human
health
and the effects on the environment from waste disposal, at any
time
in the future, shall be low and not greater than would be
currently
acceptable. The judgment of the acceptability of a disposal
option
shall be based on radiological impacts irrespective of any
national
boundaries.
<P>
<I>Objective 2 - Burden on future generations</I>: The burden on
future generations shall be limited by implementing at an
appropriate time a safe disposal option which does not rely on
long-term institutional controls or remedial actions as a
necessary
safety factor.
<P>
<LI><B>Radiation protection principles</B>.
<BR>
<I>Applied principle 1 - Optimization</I>: The system of waste
disposal shall be optimized. In doing so radiation doses and
risks
must be compared and balanced against many other factors that
could
influence the optimized solution.
<P>
<I>Applied principle 2 - Individual protection</I>: Up to
reasonably predictable time periods, the radiation doses to
individuals from the expected evolution of the disposal system
shall be less than 0.1 mSv per year. In addition, the
probabilities
and consequences of unlikely disruptive events shall be studied,
discussed and presented in qualitative terms and whenever
practicable, assessed in quantitative terms in relation to the
risk
of death corresponding to a dose of 0.1 mSv per year.
<P>
Because of different diets, living habits and environmental
conditions, there is always a  tail  in individual dose or risk
distribution. Sometimes this tail may exceed the respective
constraints though the average value in the critical group
remains
low. This is not specific to waste disposal. Acceptance of the
tail
is not contrary to present practices and is consistent with the
individual protection principle.
<P>
In general, dose assessments beyond about 10,000 years are very
uncertain. Dose assessment in the relative sense can be made for
longer time periods assuming hypothetical critical groups. In
that
case the resulting doses or risks should be interpreted as safety
indicators (relative measures of safety), not as predictions of
really occurring doses.
<P>
<I>Applied principle 3 - Long-term environmental protection:</I>
The radionuclides released from the repository shall not lead to
any significant changes in the radiation environment. This
implies
that the inflows of the disposed radionuclide into the biosphere,
averaged over long time periods, shall be low in comparison with
the respective inflows of natural alpha emitters. The activity
inflow should be averaged over long-term periods, i.e.
10<SUP>4</SUP> years or more, as it is not possible to determine
accurately when releases or their peak values occur.
<P>
The activity inflow constraint should be such that: the resulting
peak individual doses should not be in excess of the dose limit
and
even in the most extreme cases well below the level of
deterministic health effects; the resulting activity
concentrations
in primary recipients at the disposal site fall within the range
of
the typical concentrations of long-lived natural alpha emitters
in
similar environments; the activity inflow from all wastes to be
disposed of globally is low compared with the respective inflow
of
long-lived natural alpha emitters.
<P>
Calculations indicate that an appropriate constraint probably
would
fall within the following ranges: 10 to 100 kBq/per year for the
long-lived alpha emitters; and 100 to 1000 kBq/per year for the
other long-lived nuclides per amount of waste, which is produced
when one ton of natural uranium is processed into nuclear fuel
and
then used in a reactor.
<P>
<LI><B>Assurance principles.</B>
<BR>
<I>Assurance principle 1 - Safety assessments</I>: Compliance of
the overall disposal system with the radiation protection
criteria shall be demonstrated by means of safety assessments
which are based on qualitative judgment and quantitative results
from models that are validated as far as practicable.
<P>
<I>Assurance principle 2 - Quality assurance</I>: A quality
assurance programme for the components of disposal system and for
all activities from site confirmation through construction and
operation to the closure of the disposal facility shall be
established to achieve compliance with the design bases and
pertinent regulations.
<P>
<I>Assurance principle 3 - Multibarrier principle</I>: The
long-term safety of waste disposal shall be based on passive
multiple barriers so that deficiencies in one of the barriers do
not substantially impair the overall performance of the disposal
system and realistic geologic changes are likely to affect the
system of barriers only partly.
<P>
Furthermore, the Nordic criteria contain technical and
geological recommendations on site geology, repository design,
backfilling and closure and waste packaging.
<P>
<H3>Ongoing work and challenges</H3>
<P>
Continuing work on criteria is being done at the international
level through an IAEA Working Group on Principles and Criteria
for Radioactive Waste Disposal.  The group's experts are
addressing issues concerning dose versus risk, post-closure
monitoring, safety indicators in different timeframes, the
applicability of optimization, retrievability, and safeguards in
the context of waste disposal.
<P>
One question of interest is the time frame for which it is
meaningful to consider the assessments of environmental
consequences of a repository for high-level waste or spent fuel.
Some experts argue that the safety of the near generations should
be the paramount concern. Others believe that all future
generations must be equally protected. In my view, every
generation has the right either to control safety by itself or to
be ensured by earlier generations that the repository is safe.
Various tools and models may be used in the efforts to illustrate
the radiological safety of a repository over long time periods.
The first report of the IAEA Working Group on Principles and
Criteria for Radioactive Waste Disposal was published in 1994
with the title, <I>Safety Indicators in Different Time Frames for
the Safety Assessment of Underground Radioactive Waste
Repositories,</I> (IAEA TECDOC-767).
<P>
In Sweden, the programme on disposal of spent fuel is
proceeding. There is extensive research carried out by the
Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co. (SKB) that includes
suitability studies on potential sites and planned geological,
hydrological, and other research in a laboratory 500 meters
underground. Remaining problems include those related to the
criteria and methods for selecting suitable sites, and in
planning all the radiation safety analyses that must be made.
Another concern is how to make information available to local
decision-makers and citizens that they can use for their
decisions on the acceptability of proposed repository plans. On
the regulatory side, applied requirements and regulations based
on, among others, the Nordic criteria are being prepared for
issuance. Directives will also be issued on how to make
appropriate environmental impact assessments.
<P>
The resolution of issues in Sweden will receive continuing
attention, as the country moves ahead with plans to start
building its final repository for high-level waste and spent fuel
by about 2010 and take it into operation a decade later.

The IAEA, United Nations, and the new global nuclear agenda 
</H2> 
<I>Cooperative links in key areas have been strengthened in response to emerging challenges and opportunities</I> 
<P> 
<A HREF=#author><B>by Hans Blix</B></A> 
<P> 
<HR> 
<P> 
Radical changes in the global nuclear landscape after the Cold War have set the world on a compelling new course. Smaller nuclear arsenals, stronger bonds against the bomb's further spread, and renewed commitments for the atom's safe and peaceful use are all parts of the changing scene. The transformation is redefining the global nuclear agenda for the United Nations and the IAEA on the road to the next millennium. 
<P> 
Today's challenges and opportunities are rooted in the concerted international drive over the past half century to harness the atom and brighten prospects for a nuclear-weapons-free world. Despite positive steps and welcome shifts of attitude, there is a difficult distance to go. But key elements for sustaining progress are in place and the missing pieces are not hard to see. 
<P> 
The picture can be easily overshadowed by the many critical assessments and competing headlines of the day, especially in a year marking both the atomic bomb's horrific power and the anxious birth of the United Nations 50 years ago. The UN and its system of organizations have  come in for some particularly tough criticism. Whatever specific points at issue, the views are bound by common threads: the aspiration for a better and safer world, and the growing desire for greater confidence that one is being built. The UN was born as the world's instrument for international peace and security to meet humanity's highest hopes and greatest expectations, and in some ways it has been asked to carry out nearly impossible missions. As the  Atoms for Peace  organization within the UN system, the IAEA, too, is held to serve our highest standards and ideals. <A HREF=/uniaea.html>(See box.)</A> 
<P> 
While some of the criticism and calls for reform are justified, many accusations are misplaced. Often discounted is the fact that no organization operates in a vacuum. Achievements, and shortcomings, are closely bound with fluid external events and internal realities of what members are willing to do, pay for, and politically support. At the global level, the members are sovereign States who do not always see eye-to-eye every step of the way. Efforts to bridge differences, build consensus, and coordinate actions can be a complex, lengthy process. While talking about problems is not enough, it is the first step to finding and implementing workable solutions for them. 
<P> 
Fortunately, the international climate now is more conducive to constructive action than during most of the UN's first half century. The polarized ideological debates of the cold war no longer threaten to deadlock the UN. The warmer climate has opened important new avenues of global cooperation, and is bringing new problems that must be solved to the tables of the UN and its family of organizations. 
<P> 
"The problems that confront the United Nations are also a challenge for the Member States that make up the United Nations and the peoples of the world whom the organization serves," UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali has recently written. "In these changed circumstances, there is a pressing need for governments and public opinion to decide what they want the United Nations to be, what they want it to do, and what they are willing to contribute to make it work."  
<P> 
In the past, a good deal of criticism has been directed at the lack of cohesion and coordination in the UN system. In my view, the criticism is not applicable to the IAEA and its relations with the UN in the nuclear sphere. Channels have long been in place for effective cooperative action in fields of nuclear non-proliferation and arms control, and the safe development of peaceful nuclear technologies. 
<P> 
Three events over the past decade the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in 1986, the discovery of Iraq's clandestine nuclear-weapons programme in 1991, and the breakup of the Soviet Union into independent States in the 1990s   have particularly left their marks. The IAEA's agenda has adapted accordingly, to respond to new sets of problems and needs. Some programmes have been reoriented, others significantly strengthened. The overriding aim is to support States in building a stronger, more effective international framework for safe nuclear development. Allow me to more fully address some important aspects within the context of global developments and the Agency's roles within the UN system. 
<P> 
<H3>Securing a nuclear-weapons-free world</H3> 
<P> 
Most visibly in the 1990s, the IAEA and UN have demonstrated close, prompt, and effective interaction in areas of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. The widely publicized nuclear inspections in Iraq which the IAEA performs under the mandate given by the UN Security Council and with the cooperation of the UN Special Commission set up after the Gulf War are a case in point. Through dozens of IAEA-led missions under the Council's mandate, inspectors discovered and mapped Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programme, effectively moved to destroy or neutralize it, and activated a long-term monitoring and verification plan to prevent its revival.  
<P> 
The case tested the global community's resolve and the responsiveness of its mechanisms for sustained, coordinated and firm action. The IAEA's founders presciently vested the Agency with a right of direct access to the Security Council, where international authority for enforcement action is placed. The Council's determination to prevent proliferation was underscored in January 1992. In declaring that the proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a threat to international peace and security, the Council emphasized the integral role of effective IAEA safeguards in efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and stated its readiness to take appropriate measures in the case of any safeguards violations notified by the IAEA. 
<P> 
In Iraq, the Council granted the IAEA inspectorate incomparably wider powers and access to more information than States normally do under its safeguards system. Lessons from the case have prompted States to accept verification measures, and to consider others, that greatly strengthen the Agency's confidential database and verification capabilities, especially with respect to detecting undeclared nuclear activities. The Agency's inspections to verify the nuclear material subject to safeguards in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) already have demonstrated that these measures are working, albeit difficulties remain in securing the DPRK's full compliance with its safeguards agreement. 
<P> 
Overall, the Security Council has looked to the IAEA as the nuclear inspection arm of the UN system, and the IAEA has looked to the Council as the body politically responsible for ensuring compliance with nuclear non-proliferation undertakings. Building upon this established relationship is now of paramount importance as more arms-control agreements requiring verification are adopted or near completion, and the non-proliferation regime nears universality. 
<P> 
<B>Forward movements.</B> In May 1995, meeting at UN headquarters in New York, the 178 States party to the landmark Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) took important steps forward. <A HREF=priest.html>(See related article.)</A> They indefinitely extended the NPT and confirmed that the NPT involved a commitment to nuclear disarmament by the nuclear-weapon States. They targeted 1996 for conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which is being negotiated under auspices of the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. States also called for an early conclusion of an agreement to cut off production of fissile materials for weapons purposes; they endorsed the creation of more nuclear-weapon-free zones; they expressed support for ongoing efforts aimed at more effective nuclear verification and IAEA safeguards; and they called for the provision of necessary resources for the Agency to meet its responsibilities under the NPT. 
<P> 
As the outcome of the NPT Conference made clear, there is near universal renunciation of the bomb. The overwhelming majority of States no longer see the acquisition of nuclear weapons as being in the best interests of their national security. Rather, these interests today are tied to social, environmental, and economic conditions where expensive nuclear weapons are useless tools but affordable peaceful nuclear techniques are valuable resources. 
<P> 
At the same time, more States are showing a readiness to make their nuclear programmes more transparent and open to IAEA inspection and verification. They are doing so in recognition of the need to provide credible assurance to their neighbours and the world that nuclear material and installations are used exclusively for peaceful purposes. Rather than limiting national sovereignty, nuclear transparency and verification are seen as means through which a State can enhance confidence in its non-nuclear weapon status and respect for its sovereignty.  
<P> 
Extremely positive moves have been made. South Africa rolled back its nuclear-weapons programme, joined the NPT, and fully cooperated with subsequent IAEA verification measures. Both Argentina and Brazil have opened their nuclear sectors for inspection to each other and the IAEA, and nuclear-weapon-free zones pinned to IAEA verification are poised to come into being in Africa and into full force in Latin America and the Caribbean. Such a zone in the Middle East also is no longer just a utopian dream, in light of progress painstakingly achieved through the region's peace process. 
<P> 
<B>Challenges.</B> Not all States having significant nuclear activities have adhered to the NPT or accepted full-scope IAEA safeguards. That is one important missing piece of the non-proliferation regime. While these States do not say they house nuclear weapons or harbour ambitions to make them, they have so far not been willing to accept comprehensive international verification of their nuclear programmes. The hope for the future hinges on the resolution of underlying regional security problems and further progress in the nuclear disarmament field. A combination of measures will be needed, including those further reducing the nuclear arsenals of nuclear-weapon States, and fostering detente, security arrangements, and assurance that neighbours do not develop nuclear weapons. In the Middle East, for example, the IAEA is assisting States on future verification models and approaches within the framework of their desire to create a regional zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. 
<P> 
Another challenge facing the global community is the anxiety over new risks following the breakup of the Soviet Union. In particular, the illicit trafficking of nuclear materials has raised concerns, both from the standpoint of radiation safety and nuclear security. Most of the cases reported and investigated so far, predominately in Europe, have involved material of an amount or nature not useful for weapons, and none has ultimately posed a serious proliferation or radiation risk. The illegal actions have set off an alarm, however, prompting strong countermeasures against such unauthorized and uncontrolled movement of nuclear material. States cooperatively are strengthening their internal and border surveillance systems, and the IAEA is executing an action plan to assist them in dealing with some aspects of the problem. The work includes the establishment of a databank on reported trafficking cases and advising States on effective systems of nuclear material accountancy and control. In July 1995, the President of the UN Security Council issued a statement underlining the Council's support for IAEA activities in this area. 
<P> 
The dissolution of the Soviet Union also gave rise to three new independent States with nuclear weapons on their territories, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. All three have joined the NPT as non-nuclear weapon States, and accepted comprehensive IAEA safeguards. The actions reconfirm their commitments to remove all nuclear weapons from their territories, though these steps are envisaged over the longer term. 
<P> 
A number of other challenges emanate from emerging needs for effective verification in areas of nuclear disarmament and arms control. 
<P> 
<B><I>New verification roles.</B></I> The CTBT, cut-off agreement, and nuclear disarmament accords already reached or in sight will all require effective verification systems. 
<P> 
The nuclear test ban treaty will involve various types of verification measures and approaches, some of which States have noted could effectively be carried out by the IAEA. The treaty's obligations, for instance, will considerably overlap relevant provisions of the NPT, under which the IAEA already implements verification measures in non-nuclear weapon States. Some States envisage the IAEA being entrusted with further verification tasks under the CTBT. 
<P> 
The cut-off agreement foresees a non-discriminatory ban on the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons purposes. Here, too, the IAEA's relevant experience is being recognized. Under the NPT, the Agency applies safeguards to the types of installations that would be subject to verification under a cut-off agreement. 
<P> 
Under disarmament agreements, large amounts of nuclear material will arise from the dismantling of nuclear warheads. While the nuclear-weapon States will verify actual dismantlement of weapons, that is not necessarily the case for verification of the recovered plutonium and highly enriched uranium. Since late last year, the IAEA has been safeguarding some stored quantities of weapons-usable nuclear material in the United States, and it could provide similar verification in Russia or other nuclear-weapon States as decisions are taken. 
<P> 
Stockpiles of plutonium and enriched uranium are projected to grow considerably in years ahead, both as a result of weapons dismantlement and commercial nuclear operations. The Agency already is working with States on methods and approaches that are needed for effectively safeguarding these materials   whether they are kept in storage, disposed of as waste, or recycled as fuel in nuclear plants for electricity generation. 
<P> 
<B><I>Expanding legal framework.</B></I> In all these areas of non-proliferation and arms control, the established legal nuclear framework will expand as new agreements are reached. We know from experience, however, that agreements cannot be built on trust alone. They invariably call for confidence-building measures, notably effective verification. The more that armed forces and armaments are reduced, the more States will need to be confident that commitments are being observed, respected, and credibly verified.  
<P> 
The IAEA's efforts to strengthen its verification system aim at providing more credible assurances about the correctness and completeness of declared nuclear inventories under NPT safeguards agreements, and thus about the absence of  undeclared nuclear activities. Measures already in place and planned call for greater cooperation from States. That governments are supporting them signals the growing importance they place upon raising the world's level of nuclear security, and reinforcing confidence in its global guardians. 
<P> 
<H3>Nuclear safety & sustainable development</H3> 
<P> 
As in the safeguards field, new challenges and opportunities are influencing directions to ensure safe nuclear development. Many activities greatly contribute to realizing global objectives for sustainable development under Agenda 21 adopted at the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development. 
<P> 
High on the agenda are issues of nuclear and radiation safety. Since the devastating Chernobyl accident in 1986, States have adopted three safety-related international conventions under IAEA auspices and are now working on others. The adopted agreements, which all set legally binding rules, cover the early notification of nuclear accidents; the provision of assistance in the case of nuclear emergencies; and fundamental requirements and mechanisms for ensuring the safety of nuclear power plants. Under preparation is a convention covering the safe management of radioactive waste, and a revision of the Vienna Convention on liability for nuclear damage. Additionally, parties to the London Convention, under auspices of the UN's International Maritime Organization, have adopted an international ban on the dumping of radioactive waste at sea, assigning the IAEA new responsibilities. 
<P> 
These global steps do not transfer jurisdiction from national authorities who remain chiefly responsible for nuclear and radiation safety. They do, however, underline the growing awareness among States that safety levels must be high everywhere, and that basic rules should be respected by all. 
<P> 
In many instances, the work draws upon and augments the IAEA's extensive base of safety standards and services. Over the past years, for example, fundamental standards for nuclear power plants, and for radiation protection in fields of medicine, agriculture, and industry, have been revised. International organizations ranging from the World Health Organization (WHO) to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and International Labour Office (ILO) have been involved in these efforts. In 1996, the IAEA will be updating its recommendations covering the safe transport of radioactive materials, which regulators apply worldwide for shipments on land, by sea, and by air. 
<P> 
The effects of radiation releases on human health and the environment also are drawing close attention. Building upon its sponsorship of the International Chernobyl Project in the early 1990s, the IAEA is organizing with WHO and the European Commission a major international symposium in April 1996, a decade after the accident. The scientific meeting will factually assess Chernobyl's radiological consequences, in light of continuing speculation over its health and environmental effects. 
<P> 
Some special needs have arisen in countries of Central and Eastern Europe. They include upgrading levels of safety at nuclear plants of Chernobyl design, as well as other types of power reactors; improving regulation and control of radiation sources and their safe use; and coordinating actions to strengthen global cooperation with Russia in areas of radioactive waste management and environmental restoration. 
<P> 
<B>Nuclear power and energy needs.</B> Greater attention to issues of global safety should not mask the overall nuclear record, which is excellent. The world's 432 nuclear power plants, for example, generate about 17% of the world's total electricity, and far higher shares in many countries. Their normal operation has little environmental impact. As the environmentally conscious Club of Rome has noted and many States have realized in practice, nuclear power is a greener option than those emitting carbon dioxide and other gases as waste products threatening the atmosphere. 
<P> 
As sustainable development brings better living conditions to a growing world population, greater use of energy, especially electricity, will be demanded. Where will it come from?  Extensive analyses of energy options are needed to factually frame answers. The IAEA and several other international organizations are assisting in comparative assessments of the benefits and problems of different electrical power options, including nuclear energy. 
<P> 
<B>Nuclear techniques and development.</B> Most States do not have nuclear power plants, but they do apply nuclear techniques in many other ways. Being emphasized today are applications targeted at improving the production and preservation of food, health care services, industrial production processes, and  fresh water supplies, a problem of growing magnitude. 
<P> 
Working with a range of UN partners, the IAEA is carrying out projects to improve crop yields and pest controls in Bangladesh, China, and Mali, for example, and to strengthen health screening programmes of newborn infants in Tunisia and Uruguay. At the same time, desalination of seawater is drawing attention from countries in North Africa and the Middle East confronted with serious water needs. Agency specialists are examining the technology's potential. Studies include analysis of possible coupling schemes with nuclear reactors to meet both desalination's energy requirements and the electricity needs of local factories, households, and businesses. 
<P> 
Throughout these and other IAEA-supported projects, countries are building up their capacity and skills for safely applying nuclear techniques to achieve key development goals. To maximize project benefits, stretch its limited resources, and bring the needed scientific expertise to bear on specific problems, the Agency is now reinforcing its ties with national and regional development agencies and banks, as well as with other global organizations. 
<P> 
<H3> Building for the future </H3> 
<P> 
As we critically reflect upon the changing world in this commemorative year, loud headlines should not obscure the quiet achievements of global cooperation. The record reflects substantial progress, giving us much to build upon. 
<P> 
In a climate favouring nuclear cooperation rather than confrontation, renewed efforts to uplift human standards of living have a greater chance of fruition. Disarmament is integral to the pace of progress. So, too, are advances in other fields notably telecommunications, biotechnology, and branches of science and medicine that will expand our access to knowledge and understanding of earth and human life systems.  
<P> 
We have learned first hand that the world's security cannot be defined by the military dimension alone. At the personal level, human security fundamentally embodies safety from threats of hunger and disease.  
<P> 
The military side of the equation has tended to dominate thoughts   and national budgets. That is starting to change, as countries cut back military spending, overall at a 3% annual rate since 1987. The UN has estimated that the reduction the so-called peace dividend   has amounted to an estimated US $935 billion worldwide between 1987-94. Unfortunately so far, not much of that peace dividend has been rechanneled  for social and environmental development  or for what might be called  sustainable disarmament.  
<P> 
Coming decisions will greatly influence capabilities to meet the needs of global human security, in all its growing dimensions. In the next century as we heard so dramatically at the United Nations Conference on Population and Development in Cairo there will be millions more citizens of the world. The headlines tell us the population bomb is ticking, that it took 10,000 generations for the world to reach two billion people but only 46 years   about the UN's lifetime for the population to triple. 
<P> 
The future is clear in its problems. Yet as UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali has noted, it is in many ways more uncertain and complicated as to solutions. Hard work, greater cooperation, and resources are demanded. This is especially true in the nuclear sphere, where the global foundation tested and strengthened over the past decade must now be even more firmly supported to meet the challenges and opportunities before us.

Overview of the legal framework</H2> 
<P> 
<I>The global legal order for the atom's safe and peaceful  uses is grounded on a mix of binding norms and advisory regulations</I> 
<P>

<P> 
<HR> 
<P> 
Peaceful applications of nuclear energy -- and  all the promise they entail for humanity -- are paradoxically often  perceived in juxtaposition with the prospects of nuclear weapons'  proliferation and nuclear war. The mixed perception is understandable:  the materials, knowledge, and expertise required to produce nuclear  weapons are often indistinguishable from those needed to generate  nuclear power and conduct nuclear research. 
<P> 
As a result, the focus of the international community has always  been to ensure that nuclear energy is used peacefully and safely.  The approach is defined by a complex network of national and international  measures. For while it was accepted that the primary responsibility  for the regulation of the use of nuclear energy rests with national  authorities, it has been equally recognized that other countries may  be affected as well. Consequently, the regulation of nuclear energy,  like so many other human activities which could have potential transboundary  impacts, necessitates the endowment of the international community  with residual responsibility, or in certain instances co-responsibility,  to ensure among other things uniformity of standards, co-ordination,  pooling of resources and services, as well as compliance.<A HREF=#footnote>(1)</A> 
<P> 
In this respect, the IAEA, among other international and regional  organizations, has served as a focal point. Article II of  the IAEA  Statute provides that the Agency shall seek to accelerate and  enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health,  and prosperity throughout the world and to ensure so far as it  is able, that assistance provided by it or at its request  or under its supervision or control is not used in such a way as to  further any military purpose. 
 <P> 
Over the past three decades, international co-operation in the  field of nuclear energy has yielded a mix of legally binding rules  and advisory standards and regulations. This article presents an overview  of this global legal framework for nuclear energy's safe and peaceful  development. It specifically addresses areas of nuclear safety, radiation  protection, radioactive waste management, the transport of radioactive  materials, emergency assistance and planning, civil liability for  nuclear damage, physical protection of nuclear material, armed attacks  against nuclear installations, and IAEA safeguards and verification. 
<P> 
<H3>The safe use of nuclear energy</H3> 
<P> 
Article III.A.6 of the IAEA Statute empowers the Agency to establish  or adopt standards of safety for the protection of health and the  minimization of danger to life and property. That provision also requires  that those standards must be applied to the IAEA's own operations  and to operations making use of materials, services, equipment, facilities,  and information made available by the Agency or at its request or  under its control or supervision. States which receive technical assistance  or reactor project assistance must sign an agreement with the IAEA  in which they undertake to apply to the assisted operations the Agency's  safety standards and measures that are specified in the agreement.  The Statute also authorizes the Agency to apply its safety standards,  at the request of States, to any of their operations or activities. 
<P> 
In fulfilling its statutory function of developing safety standards,  the IAEA takes account of the work of relevant international scientific  and technical bodies, such as the International Commission on Radiological  Protection (ICRP), the United Nations Committee on the Effects of  Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), the World Health Organization (WHO), and  the International Labour Office (ILO). 
<P> 
Concern to ensure the safe use of nuclear energy -- which includes  activities making use of the by-products of nuclear energy  and the  use of radioactive substances in medical, industrial, and agricultural  activities -- is caused by the capacity of ionizing radiation to  cause damage to living beings and the environment. The safety objectives  strive to protect living beings, society, and the environment against  the adverse effects of ionizing radiation.  
<P> 
International action in this field began with the establishment of  the ICRP, which has issued recommendations on radiation protection  since its inception in 1928. In 1955, the United Nations General Assembly  established UNSCEAR to evaluate doses, effects, and risk from ionizing  radiation on a worldwide scale. The work of these two bodies provides  the basis for the standards elaborated by other international and  regional organizations, such as the IAEA, ILO, WHO, Euratom, and the  NEA. In developing standards, these organizations have built close  working relationships. 
<P> 
The need to establish appropriate standards designed to ensure the  safe use of nuclear energy is reflected in the constituent instruments  of such organizations. The binding nature of the safety standards  developed pursuant to such international instruments varies. Thus,  while the safety standards developed by Euratom are mandatory, the  activities relating to safety regulation of the Nuclear Energy Agency  of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD/NEA)  and the Arab Atomic Energy Agency (AAEA) are recommendatory. The IAEA's  safety standards are mandatory with regard to nuclear activities undertaken  with IAEA assistance, but where such assistance is not provided the  standards are recommendatory. 
<P> 
<B>Radiation protection.</B> The scientific basis for radiation protection  standards is found in recommendations made, and periodically reviewed,  by the ICRP which take account of the UNSCEAR studies.  
<P> 
The work underlies the <I>International Basic Safety Standards (BSS)  for Protection Against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation  Sources </I>by which the IAEA, ILO, WHO, and NEA have provided a worldwide  basis for harmonized and up-to-date standards. The BSS recently were  reviewed and revised by those four organizations together with the  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations,  and the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). The IAEA Board of  Governors approved the revised standards in September 1994.  
<P> 
The BSS are complemented by other standards dealing with particular  aspects of radiation protection: occupational protection; protection  of the public and the environment; and intervention in case of a nuclear  accident or radiological emergency. 
<P> 
<H3> Safety of nuclear power plants</H3> 
<P> 
The IAEA has developed Nuclear Safety Standards (NUSS) for nuclear  power plants which were prepared by experts from its Member States.  They cover the following five areas: governmental organization of  regulation of nuclear power plants; safety in nuclear power plant  siting; safety in the design of nuclear power plants; safety in nuclear  power plant operation; and quality assurance for safety of nuclear  power plants. It was considered that formalized safety criteria, covering  these areas, in the form of codes of practice and guides, would considerably  assist in ensuring that the basic requirements on which the safety  of nuclear power plants rest are understood and met. These basic requirements  are: an adequate supply of trained personnel at a plant and to staff  a regulatory agency; the ability to conduct a careful and detailed  safety evaluation of a nuclear power plant project from its inception  and at all stages throughout its lifeand, the ability to  conduct an appropriate quality assurance programme including control  and inspection.  
<P> 
Codes of Practice relating to each of the five areas were initially  issued in 1978, and have been subsequently revised. The Codes are  supplemented by more than 60 Safety Guides which detail their implementation. 
<P> 
Although the international community at large is not yet willing to  transform these recommendations into binding standards, they are widely  used in the elaboration of national regulations. However, the application  of NUSS is mandatory where assistance is provided by or through the  IAEA. 
<P> 
<B>Nuclear safety convention.</B> In September 1994, the International  Convention on Nuclear Safety was opened for signature at the IAEA  General Conference. Since then, six of the 58 signatory States have  become parties to the Convention.  
<P> 
The Convention commits  participating States to ensure the safety  of land-based civil nuclear power plants including such storage, handling,  and treatment facilities for radioactive materials as are on the same  site. States are obliged to take within the framework of their national  laws, the legislative, regulating and administrative measures, and  other steps necessary for implementing their obligations under the  Convention. Main features include the establishment of a reporting  system on the implementation by Contracting States of the obligations  of the Convention. 
<P> 
<B>Notification of a nuclear accident and emergency assistance.</B>  Following the Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear accident in 1979 in  the United States, the need to create a framework for reporting and  mutual assistance in nuclear accidents was brought home to the international  community. Under the auspices of the IAEA, two documents were developed  after TMI that set guidelines for States. 
<P> 
In the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident in 1986, two conventions  -- the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and  the Convention on Assistance in Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological  Emergency -- were elaborated and adopted within the framework of  the IAEA. The Conventions came into force on 27 October 1986  and 26 February 1987, respectively. Seventy-four States have become  parties to the early notification convention and 70 States have become  parties to the assistance convention.
<P> 
A number of bilateral and regional arrangements also exist in  these areas. In 1963, the Nordic Emergency Assistance Agreement in  Connection with Radiation Accidents was concluded between the IAEA  and the governments of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Also  the Council of European Communities adopted on 11 December 1984 a  Decision on Community Arrangements for the Early Exchange of Information  in the Event of a Radiological Emergency. 
<P> 
<H3> Radioactive waste management</H3> 
<P> 
In view of the potential hazard to man and the environment posed by  radioactive waste, its management and disposal have become an important  issue in considering the nuclear power option and in the use of nuclear  materials. The IAEA has developed safety objectives for the management  of radioactive waste. Several IAEA documents further have established  criteria to govern the management and disposal of radioactive waste.  The IAEA also established the Radioactive Waste Safety Standards (RADWASS)  programme in 1991 to prepare a harmonized approach to the safe management  of radioactive waste at the international level. RADWASS will constitute  a hierarchy of documents headed by a Safety Fundamentals document.
<P> 
In 1990, the IAEA General Conference adopted a Code of Practice on  International Transboundary Movement of Radioactive Waste. The Code's  purpose is to provide preventive measures against any uncontrolled  international movement and disposal of such waste. 
<P> 
States and  international organizations have also been engaged in  the regulation of radioactive waste. Two examples may be given. The  Antarctic Treaty (Article V) prohibits the disposal of radioactive  waste in the Antarctic region. Similarly, Article IV of the London  Convention 1972 regulates the sea dumping of radioactive waste. In  February 1994, amendments to the London Convention took effect that  prohibit  the dumping of all types of radioactive waste at sea. Further,  Article 5 of the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution  from Land-Based Sources obliges Member States to adopt measures to  eliminate pollution of the marine area by radioactive substances from  land-based sources. 
<P> 
Regional regulation of sea dumping of radioactive waste has also been  undertaken in various parts of the world. In 1977 a Decision of the  OECD Council replaced the <I>ad hoc</I> and voluntary arrangements  previously in existence with a Multilateral Consultation and Surveillance  Mechanism for Sea Dumping of Radioactive Waste. The decision commits  participating countries to apply the guidelines and procedures adopted  within the NEA and to subject their sea dumping operations to the  system of prior consultation and international surveillance organized  by the NEA. Other examples of regional arrangements are the Convention  on the Pollution of the Mediterranean Sea, 1976 and its two Protocols  of 1976 and 1980; the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment  of the Baltic Area, 1974; and the South Pacific Convention for the  Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific  Region, 1986. 
<P> 
The concern of developing countries that radioactive waste is not  imported into their territories was largely responsible for the inclusion  in Article 39 of the Fourth Convention (1989) between African, Caribbean,  and Pacific States and the European Economic Community of an undertaking  by the Community to prohibit the export of such waste from the territory  of its Member States. On the other hand, the African, Caribbean and  Pacific States undertook to prohibit the import of radioactive waste  from the Community or from any other country. In conformity with this  provision, Article 4 of the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import  into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous  Wastes within Africa -- which was adopted by the Organization of  African States in January 1991 -- prohibits the import of all hazardous  wastes including radioactive substances into Africa from non-contracting  parties. 
<P> 
<B>Steps toward convention on radioactive waste management. </B> In  1993, the IAEA General Conference requested the Directed General to  initiate preparations for a convention on the safety of waste management  as soon as the ongoing process of developing waste management safety  fundamentals has resulted in broad international agreement. At  its March 1995 session, the IAEA Board approved the safety fundamentals  document entitled The Principles of Radioactive Waste Management.  The  document will facilitate the work of an open-ended group of technical  and legal experts charged with carrying out the necessary substantive  preparations for a convention on the safety of radioactive waste management.  Toward this end, the group has held meetings in February and in July  1995. 
<P> 
<H3> Transport of radioactive material</H3> 
<P> 
The IAEA has taken the lead in developing appropriate regulations  for the safe transport of radioactive material. It first published  <I>Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials</I>  (Safety Series No. 6) in 1961 for application to all means of national  and international transport. The Regulations since then have been  widely accepted and adopted by competent international bodies as binding requirements for the transport of radioactive materials.  
<P> 
The transport of radioactive materials has also been dealt with through  conventions. A well known example is the International Convention  for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974. It regulates, <I>inter  alia,</I> the transport of dangerous goods including radioactive materials.  Article 23 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,  1982, regulates the exercise by foreign nuclear-powered ships or ships  carrying nuclear substances of the right of innocent passage through  the territorial sea of States. 
<P> 
<B>Safety standards for nuclear merchant ships</B>. Action to  reconsider the safety standards for nuclear merchant ships, established  by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 1981 has been  instituted. In September 1990, the IAEA General Conference requested  the Director General to consult, ...with the International Maritime  Organization the plans of the international maritime community regarding  civilian nuclear-powered ships, the need to review the Code of Safety  for Nuclear Merchant Ships in the light of existing nuclear safety  technology, and whether the Code at present applies to all existing  and projected civilian nuclear-powered ships, and if not, the  implications of extending the Code to all such ships. 
<P> 
In 1993, a Joint Working Group of the IAEA, IMO, and United Nations  Environment Programme (UNEP) elaborated a draft Code for the  Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High Level  Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on board Ships. The Code has received  the approval of the IMO Assembly and of the IAEA's policy-making organs. 
<P> 
<H3>Civil liability for nuclear damage</H3> 
<P> 
The mitigation of the consequences of a nuclear accident through prompt  and adequate compensation is an important component of the regime  for the safe utilization of nuclear energy.  Today several international  conventions regulate liability for nuclear damage.  
<P> 
The first is the 1963 Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear  Damage, concluded under the auspices of the IAEA. This Convention  is worldwide in scope but only 14 States have become parties. The  second is the 1960 Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the  Field of Nuclear Energy concluded within the framework of the OECD.  This Convention, which is regional in character and has 14 Western  European States Party to it, was supplemented in 1963 by the Brussels  Supplementary Convention. Both the Paris Convention and the Brussels  Supplementary Convention have been amended by Protocols in 1964 and  1982. 
<P> 
The basic features of the Vienna and Paris Conventions are identical.  Both are based on the exclusive and strict liability of the operator  of a nuclear installation, on limitation of liability in amount and  in time, and on the jurisdiction of the courts of the installation  State. Both Conventions provide for a minimum amount of compensation  and for financial coverage through insurance or other financial security  and, in the case of the Brussels Supplementary Convention, through  a system of state funding.  
<P> 
Two other Conventions deal with the question of liability in the context  of marine carriage. The 1962 Convention on the Liability of Operators  of Nuclear Ships, which is not yet in force, and the 1971 Convention  Relating to Civil Liability in the Field of Maritime Carriage of Nuclear  Materials. Both Conventions are based on the principle of strict liability  of the operator. 
<P> 
Regarding nuclear-related incidents in outer space, liability for  nuclear damage is covered by the 1972 Convention on International  Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects. It would govern, <I>inter  alia</I>, situations where a space object is either propelled with  nuclear power or carries nuclear objects. In 1992 the UN General Assembly  adopted a resolution  on the principles relevant to the use of nuclear  power sources in outer space.  
<P> 
For nuclear power plants, the Chernobyl accident made it clear that  the existing liability regime is not adequate to ensure equitable  and rapid compensation, particularly in the event of large-scale damage.  This is because of the regime's limited territorial application, its  narrow definition of damage, and the low level of guaranteed compensation  under it.  
<P> 
The existing regime is being strengthened. In 1988, a Joint Protocol  Relating to the Application of the Vienna Convention and the Paris  Convention was concluded. Its basic aim is to extend the scope of  application of both Conventions. It also resolves potential conflicts  of law which could result from the simultaneous application of the  two Conventions to the same nuclear accident, notably in the case  of international transport. 
<P> 
In 1990, the IAEA Board of Governors decided to set up a Standing  Committee on Liability for Nuclear Damage. It was requested to consider  international liability for nuclear damage, including international  civil liability, international State liability, and the relationship  between international civil and State liability. 
<P> 
The work of the Standing Committee has shown broad areas of agreement  on proposals for the revision of the Vienna Convention. Attention  has shifted mainly to the feasibility of elaborating a supplementary  funding convention. A number of proposals have been considered in  this respect but no general agreement has been reached. The Committee  has recommended to the IAEA Board that a diplomatic conference be  convened in 1996 to be devoted to the revision of the Vienna Convention  and supplementary funding. The Board is expected to act on the recommendation  at its meetings in September 1995. 
<P> 
<H3> Physical protection of nuclear material</H3> 
<P> 
Two international instruments provide the basis for the physical protection  of nuclear material: a set of recommendations and a Convention,  both  developed under IAEA auspices. 
<P> 
The set of recommendations was first developed in 1972 and has  been revised on three occasions since then: 1975, 1977, and 1989.  The major purposes of the most recent revision were to give equal  treatment to the concerns relating to unauthorized removal of nuclear  material and sabotage of nuclear facilities; to reflect the existence  of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material;  and to strengthen the recommendations on several points of standard  practice. 
<P> 
The recommendations reflect a broad consensus among IAEA Member States  on the requirements for effective physical protection. They apply  to nuclear material in domestic use, transport and storage; to nuclear  material in international transport; and to nuclear facilities in  a State. Although these recommendations are not binding, their application  is required by the IAEA in agreements with States that receive assistance  from it. An equivalent requirement has been included by a number of  States in bilateral nuclear co-operation agreements. 
<P> 
The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material was  adopted on 26 October 1979 and entered into force on 8 February 1987.  Its scope of application is narrower than the recommendations, in  that the Convention applies primarily to nuclear material while in  international nuclear transport (which necessarily includes storage  incidental to such transport).  
<P> 
A Review Conference of Parties to the Convention was held in Vienna  in September 1992.  Among other things, the Conference affirmed that  the Convention provides a sound basis for physical protection of nuclear  material during international transport and is acceptable in its current  form. The Conference also called upon the IAEA to organize a meeting  to examine the IAEA physical protection recommendations in IAEA document  INFCIRC/225/Rev. 2, and to consider the incorporation of further guidance  on such issues as irradiated fuel, nuclear material contained in waste,  and other matters. As a result of a Technical Committee meeting in  June 1993, revised recommendations were issued in September 1993 (as  INFCIRC/225/ Rev.3) that reflect the Committees's views in these respects. 
<P> 
<H3>Armed attacks against nuclear installations</H3> 
<P> 
Protocols I and II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 <A HREF=#footnote>(2)</A>  relate  to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts and  of non-international armed conflicts, respectively. Article 56 of  Protocol I and Article 15 of Protocol II relate to the protection  of, among other things, nuclear electrical generating stations <P> The protection accorded by the Protocols applies only to a limited  category of nuclear installations. The phrase nuclear electrical  generating stations obviously includes nuclear power reactors.  However, it would not include nuclear research reactors, enrichment  facilities, fuel fabrication facilities, reprocessing facilities,  and spent fuel storage facilities. All such facilities, particularly  the last two, could cause substantial radioactive releases if attacked. 
<P> 
Although the need to prohibit armed attacks on all nuclear facilities  and the urgency of concluding an international agreement relating  thereto, seems to be generally recognized, the establishment of more  comprehensive international rules in this area is still in the process  of development. Thus, for example, the IAEA General Conference in  1987 adopted a resolution regarding Protection of Nuclear Installations  against Armed Attacks. In the preamble of that resolution, the General  Conference recorded that it was aware of the fact that  an armed attack on a nuclear installation could result in radioactive  releases with grave consequences within and beyond the boundaries  of the State which has been attacked and was convinced of  the need to prohibit armed attacks on nuclear installations from which  such releases could occur and of the urgency of concluding an international  agreement in this regard. 
<P> 
<H3> The peaceful uses of nuclear energy</H3> 
<P> 
The impetus to ensure the peaceful use of nuclear energy that  finds expression in the IAEA Statute and the European Atomic Energy  Community (Euratom) Treaty has been supplemented by various non-proliferation  conventions. 
<P> 
The ultimate objective of the international community is the achievement  of general and complete disarmament. In the context of nuclear disarmament,  avoidance of vertical proliferation (i.e. increases in existing nuclear  arsenals) is fostered by the adoption of arms reduction agreements  between nuclear-weapon States. The prohibition of nuclear weapons  is also being sought through the adoption of requirements applicable  to all States, regardless of whether they possess nuclear weapons  and through the adoption of requirements designed to ensure that those  States that do not have nuclear weapons do not acquire them (prevention  of horizontal proliferation). 
<P> 
Examples of requirements applicable to all States are the Antarctic  Treaty; the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere,  in Outer Space and Under Water; the Treaty on Principles to Govern  the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space,  Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies; and the Treaty on the  Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons  of Mass Destruction on the Seabed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil  thereof. They are designed to limit the geographical locations where  nuclear weapons can be tested, deployed, and/or used. 
<P> 
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the  Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (the  Treaty of Tlatelolco), and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty  (the Treaty of Rarotonga) illustrate the requirements applicable to  non-nuclear weapon States. They are designed primarily to prevent  horizontal proliferation. These three treaties couple the prohibition  on the acquisition of nuclear weapons with a requirement that the  parties thereto accept IAEA safeguards on all existing and future  nuclear activities.  
<P> 
During the early 1970s, two non-treaty initiatives were undertaken  by a number of States to support the non-proliferation regime. The  first group of States, known as the Zangger Committee, are  all parties to the NPT. The Committee's aim was to establish a uniform  approach to the implementation of the obligation contained in Article  III.2 of the NPT, by defining the source and special fissionable material  and the equipment or material especially designed or prepared for  the processing, use or production of special fissionable material,  the provision of which requires the application of IAEA safeguards.  (The results of this initiative are reproduced in IAEA document INFCIRC/209/Rev.  1 and Adds. 1 and 2.) 
<P> 
The second group of States, which include participants in the  Zangger Committee initiative, is known as the London Suppliers'  Group and includes States that are and are not parties to the  NPT. This Group of States has produced a set of guidelines (reproduced  in IAEA document INFCIRC/254) for the export of nuclear  material, equipment, or technology. Consequently, the guidelines set  forth additional conditions applicable to the export of nuclear material,  equipment and technology that, for example: link the duration of safeguards  to the continued existence of safeguardable material and equipment  regardless of the duration of the safeguards agreement; require the  application of physical protection measures; require the exercise  of restraint in the transfer of sensitive facilities, technology,  and weapons-usable materials; and impose limitations on the retransfer  of certain exported items. The guidelines are also intended to remove  assurances relating to safeguards and non-proliferation from the field  of commercial competition.  
<P> 
<H3> IAEA safeguards system</H3> 
<P> 
 Article III.A.5 of the IAEA Statute authorizes the Agency to  establish and administer safeguards designed to ensure that special  fissionable and other materials, services, equipment, facilities and  information made available by the Agency or at its request or under  its supervision or control are not used in such a way as to further  any military purpose; and to apply safeguards, at the request of the  Parties, to any bilateral or multilateral arrangement, or at the request  of a State, to any of the State's activities in the field of atomic  energy. 
<P> 
The Agency's safeguards system was thus conceived as a legally binding  scheme of verification for all IAEA-related nuclear transactions which  would apply when a State received assistance from or through the IAEA  under an Agency project. Nuclear activities in which the IAEA  was <I>not </I>involved would be subject to safeguards only on  a voluntary and selective basis. 
<P> 
During the 1970s, the IAEA's safeguards system underwent a major  transformation in character and scope. The change was the result of  the development of what is referred to as the non-proliferation  regime; that is the set of legal norms and voluntary undertakings  which were developed both within and outside of the framework of the  IAEA to deal with the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and nuclear  weapons proliferation. 
<P> 
By virtue of the 1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America, each  party undertakes to use exclusively for peaceful purposes the nuclear  material and facilities which are under its jurisdiction and to prohibit  and prevent in its territory the testing, use, manufacture, production,  acquisition, receipt, storage, installation, deployment and possession  of any nuclear weapons. Each party also assumes the obligation to  negotiate multilateral or bilateral agreements with the IAEA for  the application of safeguards to its nuclear activities. 
<P> 
Of wider significance is the 1968 NPT, which is of a universal  character. It provides that each non-nuclear-weapon State party to  the Treaty assumes a basic obligation not to manufacture, acquire,  receive or control nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.  In addition, such a State agrees to accept the safeguards set forth  in an agreement to be negotiated and concluded with the IAEA in accordance  with the latter Statute and its safeguards system. The exclusive purpose  of this agreement is the verification of the fulfilment by the State  of its treaty obligation to prevent the diversion of nuclear energy  uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.  
<P> 
Additionally, the parties to the Rarotonga Treaty in Southeast  Asia and the Pacific and the Brazilian-Argentine Agreement on the  Exclusively Peaceful Utilization of Nuclear Energy have also made  a non-proliferation commitment. Thus, for States parties to these  agreements, acceptance of IAEA safeguards that are comprehensive in  scope has become obligatory in character. 
<P> 
<B>Safeguards objectives.</B> Safeguards are <I>technical</I> means  of verifying compliance with <I>legal </I>obligations relevant to  the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Their objectives are political,  that is, to <I>assure</I> the international community of the peaceful  nature of safeguarded nuclear activity and to <I>deter </I>the diversion  or misuse of safeguarded materials or facilities through the risk  of early detection. 
<P> 
The system has a number of basic features which should be understood.  The first is that the application of safeguards is primarily but not  exclusively based on information provided by the State as to the existence  of nuclear material or equipment that should be subject to safeguards.  The Agency, however, has a right to undertake special inspections  to ensure that all nuclear material that is subject to safeguards  are in fact safeguarded and for that purpose to obtain and have access  to additional information and locations to guard against possible  undeclared activities. 
<P> 
The second is that safeguards cannot by themselves prevent a  violation by a State of its obligations not to divert nuclear material  from peaceful purposes. The system is designed as an early warning  mechanism to initiate the necessary procedures for remedial action  in case of violation. Under the IAEA Statute, non-compliance with  safeguards obligations is to be reported to the United Nations Security  Council for appropriate action. 
<P> 
The third is that safeguards cannot assess the future intentions of  States. The system can be analogized to a radar device which can only  report on the existing situation.  
<P> 
The actual application of safeguards requires a contractual agreement  between the IAEA and the State in which the system will operate, whether  the application of the system is the result of a voluntary undertaking  by the State, or is in fulfilment of a legal obligation under a bilateral  or multilateral agreement. 
<P> 
Safeguards agreements set out the parties' basic rights and obligations,  relevant to the application of safeguards. Detailed implementation  procedures are found in a technical set of subsidiary arrangements,  which are tailored to the specific requirements of safeguarded facilities.  Subsidiary  arrangements are implementing instruments that do not require approval  of the IAEA Board of Governors. They are concluded between the IAEA  Secretariat and the State Party simultaneously with or subsequent  to the conclusion of the safeguards agreement. Subsidiary arrangements  are considered confidential. They are accessible only to the IAEA  Secretariat and the State Party. They are not available to other Member  States, except that specific information relating to safeguards implementation  may be given to the Board of Governors to the extent necessary for  the IAEA to fulfil its responsibilities in implementing the agreement. 
<P> 
<B>Categories of safeguards agreements.</B> Four categories of safeguards  agreements have been entered into by the IAEA. 
<P> 
The <B><I>first category</B></I> is with non-nuclear-weapon States that have  made a non-proliferation commitment, e.g. States Party to the NPT,  the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the Treaty of Rarotonga, or the Brazilian-Argentine  Agreement on the Exclusively Peaceful Utilization Of Nuclear Energy.  These safeguards agreements cover all the nuclear activities of the  State. In Argentina and Brazil, IAEA safeguards are carried out under  a Quadripartite Agreement, which is <I>sui generis </I>in nature,  between the two countries, the IAEA, and the Brazilian-Argentine Agency  for the Accounting and Control of Nuclear Material (ABACC). The other  aforementioned agreements are standard in nature and are based on  guidelines (INFCIRC/153) adopted for that purpose by the IAEA Board  of Governors. The guidelines serve as the basis for the structure  and content of these agreements. 
<P> 
Application of safeguards under these agreements is linked to the  safeguarded material.  Safeguards are terminated by the IAEA under  these agreements upon determination that the material is no longer  usable for any nuclear activity relevant from the point of view of  safeguards, or has become practically irrecoverable.  Safeguards are  terminated upon transfer of the safeguarded nuclear material out of  the State to another jurisdiction. 
<P> 
Under the Treaty of Rarotonga and the Quadripartite Agreement, Parties  are not to provide any State with nuclear material or equipment that  require the application of safeguards, unless subject to the IAEA's  safeguards. NPT Parties are under a similar obligation, but only with  regard to supplies to non-nuclear-weapon States. Provision of nuclear  material and equipment to nuclear-weapon States does not require the  application of IAEA safeguards under the NPT. Under the Treaty of  Tlatelolco, Parties are under no obligation to require the application  of IAEA safeguards on supplies of nuclear material and equipment to  other States. 
<P> 
The application of safeguards depends equally upon the duration of  the safeguards agreement. All the above agreements have provisions  stating they shall remain in force as long as the State is Party to  the respective Treaty.  
<P> 
The <B><I>second category</B></I> of agreements is with non-nuclear-weapon  States that have not made a binding non-proliferation commitment.  These agreements are normally entered into upon the conclusion of  a Project Agreement between the IAEA and a Member State; upon unilateral  submission by a State; or upon the conclusion of a supply agreement  between two or more States that requires the application of IAEA safeguards.  Agreements in this category cover only specified facilities and materials.  Assurances by the IAEA are necessarily limited to the safeguarded  facilities or materials and do not extend to cover the totality of  the State's nuclear activities. 
<P> 
The rights and obligations of the IAEA and the State under this  category of agreements are also based on guidelines adopted by the  Board of Governors (INFCIRC/66/Rev.2 and its earlier versions). These  guidelines were the first to be developed for the purpose of concluding  safeguards agreements. Unlike those developed later for NPT safeguards  agreements, they deal only with principles and procedures of applying  safeguards. 
<P> 
The basic undertaking of the State under these agreements, however,  is not to use any material, equipment, facilities or other items under  safeguards in such a way as to further any military purpose. This  undertaking, which is based on the language of the Statute, is understood  by the IAEA to prohibit the manufacture or possession of any nuclear  explosive device, and not to permit the withdrawal of any nuclear  material subject to safeguards. In most of these agreements, the duration  of safeguards and of the agreement itself is linked to the safeguarded  material and facilities. Safeguards continue to apply as long as the  material or facilities can be used for any nuclear activity which  warrant their application. Safeguards generally follow the nuclear  material upon its transfer out of the State. 
<P> 
The <B><I>third category</B></I> of agreements is with nuclear-weapon States.  All five nuclear weapon States identified in the NPT -- China,  France, the Soviet Union (now its successor, Russia), the United Kingdom,  and the United States -- have accepted the application of safeguards  on some or all of their peaceful nuclear activities. These agreements  are not designed to verify non-proliferation, but are meant to broaden  the IAEA's  safeguards experience, to affirm that nuclear-weapon States  are not rewarded by being exempt from safeguards on their peaceful  activities and, most importantly, to establish a precedent for on-site  verification in the nuclear-weapon States. Under these agreements,  facilities or nuclear material in facilities notified to the IAEA  by the State concerned are offered for the application of safeguards.  The agreements provide for the possibility of withdrawal of such facilities  or material from the application of safeguards. All of these agreements  are of unlimited duration but provide for the right of termination  upon six month's notice if the purpose for which the agreement was  intended can no longer be served. 
<P> 
The <B><I>fourth category</B></I> is with non-nuclear-weapon States  which have not made a previous non-proliferation commitment but which  are ready to make that commitment as a part of the safeguards agreement.  No guidelines have been developed for this category. One agreement  of this type was concluded with Albania before it became Party to  the NPT. The basic undertaking under this agreement is not to use  any nuclear material or facility within the territory of Albania,  or under its jurisdiction or control for the manufacture of any nuclear  explosive device or to further any military purpose. Safeguards under  the agreement continue to apply as long as such material or facilities  can be used for any nuclear activity that can warrant their application.  Albania is obliged not to transfer nuclear material, facilities  or relevant technological information to another State before the  IAEA has confirmed that it has made appropriate arrangements to apply  safeguards. The agreement has an initial duration of 25 years. Termination  of the agreement, however, does not affect the continuing application  of safeguards on material and facilities subject to safeguards at  the date of termination. 
<P> 
<B>Technical features and measures. </B> The IAEA's safeguards system  under any of the four categories of agreements has three basic features:  material accounting, containment and surveillance, and on-site inspection. 
<P> 
Material accounting establishes the quantities of nuclear material  present within defined areas and the changes in those quantities that  take place within defined periods of time. Containment and surveillance  measures are designed to take advantage of physical barriers such  as walls, containers, tanks or pipes, to restrict or control the movement  of or access to nuclear materials. Such measures help to reduce the  probability that undetected movements of nuclear material or equipment  take place. Surveillance is used to detect undeclared movements of  nuclear materials, tampering with containment, fabrication of false  information or interference with safeguards devices. The aim  of on-site inspection is verification of the IAEA's information. The  intensity and frequency of inspections are usually specified in the  safeguards agreement and vary with the type of facility inspected.  
<P> 
<B>Reporting to the UN Security Council. </B>Article XII of the  IAEA Statute requires, among other things, that the Board of Governors  report to the UN Security Council and General Assembly as well as  to all IAEA Member States any non-compliance with an IAEA safeguards  agreement which it finds to have occurred. In two instances, Iraq  and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Board of Governors  has adopted resolutions recording its finding of non-compliance.  
<P> 
The case of Iraq occurred in the aftermath of the Gulf war and included  the revelation that Iraq had constructed a large undeclared nuclear  programme, including undeclared enrichment facilities. From this case,  it  became apparent that the IAEA safeguards system -- though effective  with regard to declared activities -- is incomplete insofar as  its ability to detect undeclared activities. Since that time, the  focus of the IAEA has been to adopt measures designed to strengthen  the safeguards system and in particular to develop an ability for  the system to detect and have access to undeclared activities. Important  measures already have been taken. 
<P> 
Following recommendations made by the IAEA's Standing Advisory Group  on Safeguards Implementation, in April 1993, the Agency instituted  a safeguards development programme (Programme 93+2) to consider the  feasibility of further measures to strengthen and improve the cost-effectiveness  of safeguards. At its March 1995 session, the IAEA Board endorsed  the general direction of the Programme and requested specific proposals,  which were submitted to the Board in June 1995. In June, the Board  took note of the Agency's plan to implement at an early date the measures  identified by the Secretariat as being within the scope of existing  legal authority of comprehensive safeguards based on INFCIRC/153 (corrected),  with the understanding that elaboration of the implementation arrangements  for, and clarification of concerns about, them would require consultations  between the Secretariat and individual Member States. The Secretariat  intends to submit specific proposals relating to those measures that  require complementary authority for their implementation to the IAEA  Board in December 1995. 
<P> 
<H3> IAEA verification under the UN Charter</H3> 
<P> 
The IAEA's nuclear inspections in Iraq were undertaken in accordance  with resolutions of the UN Security Council. Following the cessation  of hostilities in the Gulf War, the Security Council -- acting  under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter -- adopted Resolution  687 on 3 April 1991. Paragraph 12 of that Resolution required Iraq  to unconditionally agree not to acquire or develop nuclear weapons  or nuclear-weapons-usable material or any subsystems or components  or any research, development, support or manufacturing facilities  related thereto; to provide a declaration of the locations, amounts,  and types of all items referred to above; to place all of its nuclear-weapons-usable  materials under the exclusive control, for custody and removal, of  the IAEA, acting with the assistance and co-operation of a Special  Commission to be established pursuant to the Resolution; to accept  on-site inspection and the destruction, removal and rendering harmless  of all the above-mentioned items; and to accept a plan, to be prepared  by the IAEA Director General, for the future ongoing monitoring and  verification of its compliance with these undertakings. 
<P> 
Operative paragraph 13 of the Resolution requested the IAEA Director  General, with the assistance and co-operation of the Special Commission,  to carry out immediate on-site inspection of Iraq's nuclear capabilities  based on Iraq's declarations and any additional locations designated  by the Special Commission; to develop and carry out a plan for the  destruction, removal, or rendering harmless of all items referred  to in operative paragraph 12; and to develop a plan for the future  ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance with operative  paragraph 12, including an inventory of all nuclear material  in Iraq subject to the IAEA's verification and inspection to confirm  that IAEA safeguards cover all nuclear activities in Iraq. 
<P> 
These provisions of Resolution 687 were supplemented by Security  Council Resolution 707, adopted on 15 August 1991, which imposed further  restrictions on permissible nuclear activities in Iraq. 
<P> 
In carrying out its inspections in Iraq, the IAEA had more extensive  verification rights than it has under safeguards agreements. This  has been outlined in an Exchange of Letters between the United Nations  and Iraq on the rights and privileges necessary for the IAEA and the  Special Commission to perform their activities under Resolution 687.  The various plans required by Resolution 687 were approved by Security  Council Resolutions 699 and 715. It should be noted that the plan  for on-going monitoring also contains extensive rights and privileges  for the IAEA in comparison with safeguards agreements. 
<P> 
<H3> Other verification initiatives</H3> 
<P> 
The international community is currently considering three arms control/non-proliferation  initiatives with potential impact on the IAEA's  verification activities.  First, a Committee of the UN Conference on Disarmament (CD) is in  the process of developing a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty  (CTBT). Although the work of the CD Committee is still in progress,  it seems likely that the CTBT being developed by it will include seismological  monitoring, on-site inspections to ascertain the nature of events  that have not been satisfactorily explained, on-site monitoring of  large non-nuclear explosions, and an International Data Centre to  process the information obtained from seismological monitoring (and  from other monitoring -- e.g., of radionuclides in the atmosphere  -- that may be agreed to be included in the CTBT). It is possible  that the CTBT will assign a number of the verification activities  under the Treaty to the IAEA. 
<P> 
Secondly, consideration is being given to the development of a treaty  that would ban the future production of plutonium and highly enriched  uranium for use in nuclear weapons (the so-called Cut-Off Treaty).  Last year, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted resolution  A/Res/48/75 L, which, among other things: 
<P> 
Recommend[ed] the negotiation in the most appropriate international  forum of a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and  effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material  for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; 
<P> 
Request[ed] the International Atomic Energy Agency to provide  assistance for examination of verification arrangements for such a  treaty as required; and 
<P> 
Call[ed] upon all States to demonstrate their commitment to the  objectives of a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally  and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile  material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 
<P> 
The third initiative relates to the possibility that the plutonium  and highly enriched uranium that was formerly contained in nuclear  weapons but is no longer required for that purpose will be submitted  to IAEA safeguards by some or all of the nuclear-weapon States. 
<P> 
<H3> A changing progressive picture</H3> 
<P> 
The international legal order for nuclear energy is characterized  by a mix of legally binding rules and agreements and advisory standards  and regulations. This mix is constantly changing. What were recently  non-binding standards are today binding commitments. The conventions  in the area of physical protection and for the notification of a nuclear  accident and emergency assistance are but some examples.  
<P> 
The fact that many regulations are still non-binding should not be  a matter for concern. Many States have accepted such standards as  a basis for their national legislation. By doing so, they have, in  effect, voluntarily undertaken to comply with international norms  that they formally view as recommendations because of their belief  that it is in their best interest to do so. 
<P> 
Long at the centre of the process, the IAEA will remain actively engaged  in the progressive international development of nuclear law.

From the laboratory to the field</H2>

<I>From monitoring exposures to supporting cooperative projects, the IAEA's activities are being tailored to meet new demands</I>
<P>
<A HREF=#author>
<B>by Robert Ouvrard and Fernando-Lopez Lizana</B></A>
<HR>
Developments commanding global attention over the past decade have elevated interest in issues of nuclear and radiation safety. In various ways, States today are placing greater emphasis on cooperative projects and services designed to establish or strengthen national capabilities for effective radiological protection.
<P>
At the international level, the Agency has long provided extensive safety-related services. In the field of radiation safety, the work has involved the formulation of standards and advisory missions, for example. In 1979, the IAEA set up a Radiation Safety Services Section (RSSS) to technically support activities in radiation protection. The work involves the operation of radiation protection laboratories, the provision of analytical and support services, and operation of an emergency response system. <A HREF=radservices.html><I>(See box.)</I></A> In recent years, for example, these services have supported the Agency's post-Chernobyl radiological assessments, as well as its nuclear inspections in Iraq. This article takes a closer look at activities, specifically those related to radiation monitoring, field projects, and emergency planning and response.
<P>
<H3>Radiation monitoring services</H3>
<P>
The IAEA provides radiation monitoring services for its own staff whose work can involve exposure to radiation, and for personnel participating in Agency-supported projects, predominately in developing countries. The monitoring system covers external exposure as well as internal contamination, and it extends to laboratory and field services. 
<P>
<B><I>External exposure monitoring</I></B>. About 400 IAEA staff members are routinely monitored for external exposure, 300 from the Department of Safeguards and 100 from the IAEA's laboratories. Another 400 individuals typically are monitored in connection with particular assignments. These include about 150 technical cooperation experts, 150 specialists taking part in safety missions, and 100 scientific fellows and trainees.
<P>
The RSSS also provides dosimetry services to some Member States under technical cooperation projects or through a joint programme run with the World Health Organization (WHO).  In total, about 2800 persons are monitored yearly.
<P>
To strengthen its services, the RSSS recently acquired two new thermoluminescent dosimeter readers for the determination of external radiation doses. It is also working with the Hungarian Atomic Energy Research Institute on the calibration and development of a new specific algorithm for neutron dosimeters. Another area of development is computerized record-keeping, where a new system has been instituted. A data management system was created, for example, to efficiently monitor individual annual exposures and ensure that they comply with existing radiation protection requirements. The programme further enables analysis of trends in radiation exposures.
<P>
Radiation workers whose extremities may be exposed to high doses are provided with  specific dosimeters. Such workers include, for example,  those who handle solutions  that emit high energy beta radiation (e.g. phosphorus-32), or medical staff involved in specific X-ray techniques. The dosimeters consist of lithium fluoride crystals mounted on finger rings which are assembled and processed at the Vienna International Centre (VIC) laboratory. Whereas the need for such dosimeters is relatively limited among IAEA staff, the demand from developing countries has increased during recent years. Up to 1600 dosimeters have been dispatched annually.
<P>
<B><I>Internal contamination monitoring</I></B>. The RSSS operates the whole-body counter, which is installed at the IAEA's Laboratories in Seibersdorf, Austria. Measurements are done using the stretcher geometry assisted by four sodium-iodine (NaI) detectors for gamma emitters and two Phoswich detectors for low energy photon emitters (which is the case for plutonium). To maintain the whole-body counter at the highest technical level, two new Phoswich detectors were purchased. Also acquired was a thyroid uptake monitoring system for surveys of radioactive iodine incorporation in the event of a nuclear accident. 
<P>
This whole-body counter proved invaluable during the period shortly after the Chernobyl accident. From May to December 1986, a study was conducted on individuals working at the IAEA Seibersdorf Laboratories to assess the immediate impact of the accident in this area. This study confirmed, as observed in other countries, that the actual individual intake was below the expected value (sometimes by a factor of three) obtained from practical environmental measurements and using theoretical models. During the same period, collaboration was initiated with the Austrian Research Centre for the measurement of various groups of the local population. In November 1986, seven months after the Chernobyl accident, a study was undertaken on the daily caesium-137 urine excretion from IAEA staff. The observed mean daily value was 12.2 becquerel per day (Bq/d), corresponding to 0.67% of the whole body content, in good agreement with the values reported in international surveys (range of 0.3%  to 1.3 %). The result was also in good agreement with the calculated daily intake (from food) derived from body measurements done on the same subjects. In April 1990, at the request of the Byelorussian authorities, measurements were performed on four of their nationals.
<P>
<B>Quality assurance</B>. Quality control of measurements is periodically conducted through intercomparison exercises with external institutions. These have been done, for example, with institutes in Germany, namely the University of Saarland in 1985; the University of Frankfurt in 1989; and the nuclear research centre in Karlsruhe in 1992.
<P>
<B>Support in field projects and missions</B>
<P>
Two highly publicized cases have illustrated how the IAEA's radiation safety services are applied in the field:  the International Chernobyl Project, and the nuclear inspections in Iraq under terms of UN Security Council resolutions.
<P>
<B><I>Chernobyl project</I></B>. During 1990-91, the RSSS was involved in the monitoring of individuals in nine selected villages affected by the Chernobyl accident. From May to December 1990, about 12,000 individual dosimeters were distributed  in cooperation with Russian experts. At the same time, the instrument's purpose and the project's aims were explained to the people.
<P>
During the same period, the RSSS organized a campaign of internal contamination monitoring among the population. With a mobile whole-body counter provided by France, four teams worked in shifts and often under rather poor environmental conditions to conduct about 10,000 individual measurements. Results were used in subsequent studies.
<P>
<B><I>Iraq</I></B>. In May 1991, the RSSS was requested to take responsibility for radiation protection during IAEA missions in Iraq. The work involved providing equipment, advice, and assistance to team members, as well as ensuring that individual exposures were kept to a minimum. Major tasks during these missions dealt with the safe handling of nuclear fuel materials, and fresh or spent fuel elements. Agency radiation experts played a particularly valuable role in the operation to remove spent fuel from Iraq.*  Individual radiation exposures among the 170 people involved in the mission were kept reasonably low, far below the level which could have been expected for such a difficult operation. This testifies to the cooperative preparatory work and the high level of expertise available during the operation.
<P>
<H3>Laboratories and related facilities</H3>
<P>
The IAEA operates a number of laboratories  where radioactive materials are or may be handled. They are principally located in Seibersdorf and Monaco, with smaller facilities at approved locations in the Vienna International Centre. 
<P> 
A radio-chemical laboratory for the measurement of alpha emitters in urine has been operational since 1993 and located at Seibersdorf. About 350 samples are analyzed yearly for alpha contamination. In addition, a gamma spectrometry facility is used for analyzing more than 500 urine samples a year for gamma contamination.
<P>
The RSSS has set up a comprehensive monitoring programme to ensure compliance with good radiation protection practices and maintenance of proper working conditions. This programme concentrates on activities at the IAEA's Safeguards Analytical Laboratory (SAL) where plutonium and transuranium radioisotopes are handled. About 12,000 smears and 700 air monitoring filters are checked yearly for contamination.
<P>
The RSSS is also in charge of a scanner unit which measures the plutonium content of radioactive wastes generated by the Seibersdorf Laboratories and stored in drums. A special computer program has been developed that provides necessary data and results, together with graphs showing the physical distribution of activity and density in measured waste drums. This makes it possible to localize, if needed, higher activity "clusters" inside any drum. From 1981 to 1994, more than 250 drums were measured in this installation.
<P>
<H3>Radiation monitoring equipment</H3>
<P>
To fulfill its monitoring and assistance tasks, the RSSS makes use of various types of equipment. They include 50 contamination monitors, 45 dose rate meters, seven hand monitors, six count rate meters, three multichannel analyzers, and 100 electronic personal dosimeters. All equipment is checked and calibrated yearly, with the assistance of the Dosimetry Unit at Seibersdorf. A loan service has been established to respond to staff demand.
<P>
In addition, the RSSS provides users, as needed, with practical handbooks for specific equipment; tests new equipment loaned by suppliers, in view of their potential use either for internal purposes or in the framework of technical cooperation projects; develops special indigenous instrumentation, for its own use; and provides advice on radiation protection equipment. A database has been prepared for this purpose, and now contains  more than 600 entries.
<P>
<B>Training activities.</B>  IAEA training activities in radiation protection frequently draw upon the expertise of RSSS staff for lectures, practical exercises, and monitoring demonstrations, for example. This has been the case, for example, for introductory courses on IAEA safeguards, and for radiation protection courses under Agency technical cooperation projects.
<P>
In addition, new staff and visiting scientific fellows at the Seibersdorf Laboratories receive training tailored to the requirements of their tasks.
<P>
<H3>Emergency Response Unit</H3>
<P>
After the Chernobyl accident in 1986, States approved two international conventions which placed responsibilities on the IAEA for the establishment of an Emergency Response Unit. The unit, which is operated by the RSSS, additionally supports the efforts of IAEA Member States to meet their obligations under these conventions, which address the early notification of a nuclear accident and the provision of assistance in the case of a radiological emergency. 
<P>
At the IAEA's headquarters, a dedicated facility contains communication and computer equipment, as well as the documentation and databases that would be needed to deal with an emergency.
<P>
Two exercises have been conducted, in April 1990 and in January 1992, involving Agency staff and those from Member States, other UN organizations, and diplomatic missions to the IAEA. Results were used to improve the emergency response system, in terms of its resources and facilities, operational procedures, and communication capabilities.
<P>
Other activities have included:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>assisting authorities in 1987 in connection with the accident in Goiania, Brazil, that involved a large caesium-137 teletherapy source. The IAEA provided both equipment and expert advisory services.
<P>
<LI>coordinating the receipt, assessment, and dispatch of data in 1992 in connection with the widely reported incident at a nuclear plant near St. Petersburg, Russia;
<P>
<LI>assisting Vietnamese authorities in March 1993 in dealing with the overexposure of an individual conducting research with a 15 MeV electron beam. The Agency arranged, through the ERU, for the patient to receive specialized treatment at an institution in France.
<P>
<LI>transmitting notification that the IAEA received from Russian authorities in  1993 of the accident at the Tomsk facility. A team of IAEA experts was sent to the site to assess the situation.
<P>
<LI>helping Estonian authorities in late 1994 to arrange for an international team of experts in connection with an incident involving a stolen caesium-137 source. The incident had resulted in one death and several overexposures among the general population.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Responding to new needs</H3>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, the IAEA's activities in areas of radiation protection have expanded considerably in the face of growing demands for expert assistance and services.  Initially foreseen to deal only with the Agency's internal requirements, the RSSS increasingly is called upon to support cooperative projects and missions. 
<P>
A number of developments today point toward new demands ahead. The implementation of the new International Basic Safety Standards for Protection Against Ionizing Radiation and the Safety of Radiation Sources is foreseen to demand the monitoring of a wider group of individuals and the study of new dosimetry concepts. Overall in areas of radiation protection, greater emphasis further is being placed on quality assurance and control. Also increasingly evident is a growing need for practical training and related services, especially in developing countries, where national radiation protection infrastructures are being established. 
<P>
In these areas, among others, the IAEA's established radiation protection services provide a solid basis for responding to emerging requirements for technical expertise and support.

(Editor's note:  This article includes boxes on <A HREF=#FOOTNOTE_1>The Final Package of Decisions</A> and on <A HREF=#FOOTNOTE_2> The NPT Conference and the IAEA.</A>
<HR>
<P>
Even before the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) took effect in 1970, the IAEA was an integral component of the world's efforts against the spread of nuclear weapons. The NPT significantly expanded the world's nuclear verification system and the Agency's central role, to the extent that today nearly all of the IAEA's safeguards agreements are concluded in connection with the Treaty. On that basis alone, the outcome of the NPT Review and Extension Conference in May 1995 was of major importance to the Agency and the international community it serves. 
<P>
On 11 May 1995, the Conference decided to extend the Treaty indefinitely, with greater accountability in future review conferences about its implementation.  It further adopted a set of Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, and a resolution on the Middle East. <A HREF=#FOOTNOTE_1>(See box.)</A> The Conference, however, was not able to adopt a Final Declaration.
<P>
Overall, as IAEA Director General Hans Blix has pointed out, the NPT Conference sent some welcome overriding messages. It reconfirmed that the ultimate objective of the Treaty is a nuclear-weapon free world, and supported the  Atoms for Peace approach for the use and transfer of peaceful nuclear technology consistent with NPT provisions. For the IAEA, this points to the continued importance of its existing, and in some cases expanding, roles in areas of verification and safeguards, nuclear safety, waste disposal, transfer of nuclear technology, and technical assistance.
<P>
This article takes a closer look at the deliberations and decisions of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. In so doing, it focuses on the achievements as they relate to the evolving role and responsibilities of the IAEA, and outlines those issues of relevance to the Agency on which consensus could not be reached.
<P>
<H3>NPT extension: Options and decision</H3>
<P>
The indefinite extension of the NPT, which originally was given a 25-year lifespan, was by no means a foregone conclusion. In fact, very few delegates or observers at the opening of the Conference would have been ready to bet on that outcome. On the other hand, there were also few who did not wish to see the Treaty given a long lease of life, even its greatest critics.  
<P> 
Various options were announced or proposed in addition to indefinite extension. In the months before the Conference opened, Venezuela announced an option that would extend the Treaty for another 25-year period on the same terms and conditions it was originally concluded. There was uncertainty, however, whether the Treaty's provisions could be interpreted to provide for the necessary subsequent extension conferences. By the third week of the Conference, the Venezuelan approach was replaced by two formally proposed options to go alongside the one for indefinite extension. The first option, introduced by Indonesia, called for extending the Treaty for rolling fixed periods of 25 years, with review conferences convened every 5 years. The second option, introduced by Mexico, proposed indefinite extension tied to a number of commitments, the attainment of which would be reviewed every 5 years.
<P>
Well into the Conference, Canada took the initiative to circulate a draft decision for indefinite extension through which States could indicate the position they would take should the question come to a vote. In the end it was through this initiative that the Conference was able to decide that a majority existed for indefinite extension. Only Egypt and Syria mentioned the suspension of the Conference if no decision could be taken, with it to reconvene at a later date until which time the Treaty would remain in force.
<P>
Of the five nuclear-weapon States, four   France, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom   advocated indefinite extension from the start, strongly supported by Canada, Australia, and most European States. China joined the support later. While some developing countries supported indefinite extension from the beginning, most did not. The opposition started to fade about midway into the NPT Conference, following the outcome of the Bandung meeting of Foreign Ministers of States in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). The meeting did not unite around demands for the option of a 25-year rolling extension.
<P>
By the third week of the Conference, more than 100 States had signed up for indefinite extension and the question was no longer whether or not the Treaty would be extended indefinitely, but by how great a majority and under what conditions.
<P>
While it was clear that there would be a majority for indefinite extension if it came to a vote, the President of the Conference, Sri Lankan Ambassador Jayantha Dhanapala, was firm in seeking to achieve consensus. Using its unique position as an ex-nuclear-weapon State and as a non-aligned developing country, South Africa proposed linking an  enhanced  review process and the acceptance of principles  covering non-proliferation, universality, safeguards, peaceful uses, nuclear disarmament and nuclear-weapon-free zones with the decision to extend the Treaty indefinitely. South Africa stressed that the principles were not conditions , but a  yardstick . These principles were discussed in a small group of Friends of the President parallel to the review of the Treaty which was being carried out in three main committees. In the end, it was this package, augmented by a resolution on the Middle East, that won the day.  
<P>
<H3>Main Committee I: Disarmament and security issues</H3> 
<P>
The aim of the NPT Conference to adopt a Final Declaration on the review of the Treaty's implementation could not be achieved because of deep divisions within Main Committee I over the issues of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.
<P>
<B>Polarized debate.</B> Main Committee I was unable to resolve the fundamental difference of perception on issues between the nuclear-weapon States and the majority of non-nuclear-weapon States. The disagreements cut across North-South lines. Notably, criticism of the nuclear-weapon States on issues of disarmament brought together members of the NAM and some members of the Western European and Other States Group.
<P>
<B><I>Non-proliferation commitments.</I></B> At issue was the responsibility for past acquisitions by non-nuclear weapon States of sensitive nuclear technology and the manner in which future transfers could be prevented. The first disagreement occurred when Mexico raised two questions: whether Articles I and II were violated by the deployment of American and British nuclear weapons in the territories of other NATO members, with control transferable in times of war; and whether nuclear components and technology received by the UK under the US/UK Mutual Defense Agreement constituted nuclear transfer in breach of Article 1.
<P>
Many NAM members agreed with Mexico that such transfers were not consistent with NPT obligations, while the argument was vigorously refuted by the US, the UK, and a number of NATO members. A second issue concerned a point made by Iran and several Arab States that certain nuclear-weapon States should bear responsibility for the acquisition of sensitive nuclear technology and materials by non-NPT parties, particularly Israel. No responsibility was acknowledged by any nuclear-weapon State for any such transfers. A third issue concerned the breach by Iraq of its non-proliferation obligations under Article II and the non-compliance by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) with its safeguards obligations under Article III, with possible implications for Article II. There was not much disagreement on these issues as such, except by Iraq and the DPRK themselves who would not join a consensus if their cases were explicitly mentioned. The prevailing view among the NAM members was that a balanced assessment of non-compliance should cover both Articles I and II.  
<P> 
These issues by themselves were not intractable but they could not be resolved in the context of the deeper division over Article VI.
<P>
<B><I>Disarmament.</I></B> The main disagreement regarding Article VI concerned the following issues: whether the arms race has indeed ceased; how to speed up the process of nuclear disarmament by all nuclear-weapon States and achieve total elimination of nuclear weapons; how to strengthen existing security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States; and whether a plan of action with specific time-frames was feasible for future nuclear disarmament. There was less problem with the specific issues of negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and a cut-off agreement on fissionable material. On those issues, the adopted Principles and Objectives reflect the eventual agreements.
<P>
The Principles and Objectives acknowledge that nuclear disarmament is substantially facilitated by the easing of international tension and by the strengthening of trust between States. They include specific measures that would certainly require effective verification. 
<P>
On disarmament issues, the five nuclear-weapon States reaffirmed the position that they had taken in recent declarations. In April 1995, France, Russia, the UK, and the US had issued a joint statement which welcomed the fact that the arms race had ceased, underlined the importance of the security assurances that were approved by the Security Council, and reaffirmed their commitment, as stated in Article VI,  to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament, which remains [their] ultimate goal.  The fifth nuclear-weapon State, China, had issued a separate declaration, reiterating its position on non-first use of nuclear weapons and its support for legally binding security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States. It also called for the complete prohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons. But it did not address many of the specific issues raised by the non-nuclear-weapon States.
<P>
Countries of the Non-Aligned Movement contended that the arms race could not be assumed to have ended, as long as new warheads were being made, fissionable material was being produced for weapons, and nuclear tests were allowed. While the recent nuclear reductions by Russia and the United States were welcomed, the NAM countries called for further commitments to deeper cuts by them and by China, France, and the UK at this stage. They further regarded the reference to nuclear disarmament as an  ultimate goal  and its placement in the context of  general and complete disarmament  as language presenting disarmament as a virtually unreachable goal. They also argued that the Conference should agree on a programme of action for concrete steps towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future.
<P>
<B>Committee report.</B> The polarized debate led to deadlock and a massive heavily bracketed report reflecting all the differences. The report could therefore not provide a basis for the segment of the draft Final Declaration addressing non-proliferation and disarmament issues. In the last week of the Conference, parallel with the effort of the Conference President, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, Tadeusz Strulak of Poland, drafted a new paper reflecting a middle course on the divisive issues. But no consensus could be reached on the last day of the Conference, even with the active support of the Conference President and the backdrop of the adoption of the final package of decisions.
<P>
In a broad sense, however, it can be concluded that the absence of agreement was partly filled by the relevant elements of the decision on Principles and Objectives. Of particular significance were the paragraphs on CTBT, the cut-off agreement, and security assurances, all of which went beyond the points of the April joint statement of the four nuclear-weapon States.
<P>
<H3>Main Committee II: Non-Proliferation, safeguards, and nuclear-weapon-free zones</H3>
<P>
Largely because fundamental differences in Main Committee I precluded agreement on a Final Declaration, the report of Main Committee II was issued as a document of the Conference. It will, one assumes, be a point of reference for future work under the enhanced review mechanism. The main point, however, from the IAEA perspective is that some of the key elements (and indeed the language) of the Main Committee II report are incorporated in the adopted Principles and Objectives. <A HREF=#FOOTNOTE_1>(See box).</A>
<P>
To facilitate its work, the Committee had before it 15 Background Documents, including three prepared by the IAEA relevant to Article III, Article IV, and Article V, and 18 separate working papers submitted by individual or groups of delegations on topics relevant to the Committee's deliberations.
<P>
<B>Safeguards.</B> What, from the IAEA perspective, could reasonably have been expected from the Conference, and what was achieved? 
<P>
At previous NPT Review Conferences,  Parties had expressed or reaffirmed the conviction that Agency safeguards play a key role in preventing proliferation.  They inter alia had reaffirmed their determination  to strengthen barriers against nuclear weapons proliferation and had urged the IAEA to take full advantage of its rights under safeguards agreements. Previous Conferences had also welcomed the significant contributions made by NPT Parties in facilitating safeguards application and had recognized the crucial importance of continuing political, technical, and financial support for IAEA safeguards.
<P>
The detailed IAEA Background Document submitted to the Conference on safeguards highlighted the measures which had been taken in response to such decisions and conclusions. It did so against the background of new and ever-increasing demands upon the Agency's safeguards system; the financial constraints and critically important developments relevant to safeguards since 1990, notably the discovery of Iraq's clandestine nuclear programme; the end of the Cold War and all its implications; and the needs emerging as a result of advances in areas of nuclear disarmament.
<P>
It was significant that the 1995 Conference reaffirmed support for IAEA verification and ongoing efforts to strengthen safeguards, which the IAEA applies on behalf of the international community, and that it decided, in the broad interests of the non-proliferation regime, on the long-term future of the Treaty. This is because the duration of safeguards agreements between the IAEA and NPT Parties are linked to the Treaty itself.
<P>
The safeguards-related elements of the adopted Principles and Objectives can be expected to have significant implications for the further evolution of the verification system, both in terms of its scope of application and effectiveness. Although the safeguards system has proved effective with regard to declare nuclear activities, the case of Iraq made clear that the system was not effectively equipped to detect any undeclared activities, primarily because of a shortage of information about any such activities. This realization was fundamental to the first and subsequent steps that the IAEA Board of Governorshas approved and which are aimed at correcting such shortcomings. Strengthening measures in place had already proved effective, for example in connection with IAEA verification activities related to assessing the completeness and correctness of the DPRK's declaration of its nuclear material subject to safeguards.
<P>
In the broad interests of the non-proliferation regime, it was very important for the Agency that the NPT Conference supported and endorsed what it was seeking to achieve in strengthening safeguards. The IAEA gave a presentation at the Conference on  Programme 93+2, its overall safeguards development programme, that was well received. During the General Debate and throughout the Committee's discussions, many positive statements were made about the IAEA's efforts, and the continuing need to support them, notwithstanding some divergences of views on some of the programme's specific ideas and proposals.
<P>
In terms of the practical support which might be expected to assist safeguards implementation, the 1995 Conference inter alia acknowledged that under comprehensive safeguards agreements, NPT Parties and the IAEA have an obligation to co-operate fully to ensure effective safeguards in all circumstances. In this respect it is to be hoped that   over and above the characteristic calls upon Parties at NPT Conferences to ensure adequate technical and financial support for safeguards   States will also agree to implement other measures of practical value for the efficient discharge of the IAEA's functions. These include such measures as agreeing to simplify designation procedures for Agency inspectors and agreeing to waive visa requirements or to grant multiple-entry visas to Agency inspectors. This is particularly important, given that short notice or no notice inspections are among key elements of safeguards strengthening proposals under Programme 93+2 . Clearly, such inspections cannot be carried out if restrictive visa requirements prevail.
<P>
<B>Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zones (NWFZs).</B> Article VII of the NPT reflects the significance of regional non-proliferation arrangements as valuable complements to global ones. NWFZs established by virtue of the Tlatelolco and Rarotonga Treaties provide for verification arrangements closely linked with safeguards implementation pursuant to the NPT. Additionally, a draft Treaty on an African NWFZ also assigns to the IAEA the responsibility for verifying compliance. In the Middle East, although the creation of an NWFZ is likely to come about only in the context of an overall peace settlement, there is agreement in principle among Middle East States as to the potential value of such a zone in their region.
<P>
The importance attributed to NWFZs by NPT Parties was reflected in three specific paragraphs of the Principles and Objectives. In discussions on this issue, there was a broad agreement about the value of and growing interest in NWFZs. There were differences of view, however, as to the appropriate language for referring to NWFZs in specific areas. Some differences were accommodated through a spirit of compromise. Thus, ultimately, bracketed language was retained in the relevant paragraphs of the Main Committee II report only with regard to a future NWFZ in the Middle East (because of very predictable differences of perception centering on Israel's accession to the Treaty and the significance of the Middle East peace process) and on an NWFZ in Central Europe (supported by Belarus but contested by others, essentially on the grounds of what constituted  Central Europe). 
<P>
That said, it is significant that the Conference was firm in its conviction, expressed formally through the Principles and Objectives, that the development of NWFZs, especially in regions of tension, should be encouraged as a matter of priority, taking into account the specific characteristics of each region.  Of relevance as well is the resolution on the Middle East which was adopted on 11 May 1995. It calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.
<P>
<B>Other related issues.</B> Other issues relevant to safeguards were addressed in Main Committee II. Thus, paragraphs in the Committee's report address, inter alia, a need for greater transparency on the management of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for civil purposes; the paramount importance of effective physical protection of nuclear material, especially such material useable for military purposes; the need for strengthened international co-operation and physical protection in preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear material, (including in this respect the work already being conducted under IAEA auspices); and the non-proliferation benefits of converting civilian research reactors from high enriched uranium to low enriched uranium fuel.
<P>
<H3>Main Committee III: Peaceful uses of nuclear energy</H3>
<P>
The peaceful uses  Committee benefitted from a constructive and non-confrontational atmosphere from the outset. The only matter which eluded consensus was a text that expressed regret concerning restrictions on free and unimpeded access to peaceful nuclear technology which was sent to the Drafting Committee. The delegation of Iran insisted on the retention of the text within brackets, but intimated that it might be withdrawn in the light of final versions of other bracketed text being looked at by the Drafting Committee.  Since the Drafting Committee was unable to put together a consensus text, this short paragraph remained in brackets.
<P>
At the Conference, as it did with respect to its safeguards work, the IAEA gave a presentation on its technical cooperation and related activities. The deliberations of Main Committee III were supportive of IAEA efforts. Technical cooperation and nuclear safety activities were specifically mentioned in the adopted Principles and Objectives as areas where efforts should be made to ensure that the IAEA has the financial and human resources necessary to meet its responsibilities. The Committee reviewed with approval the new directions of IAEA's technical cooperation programme. It also discussed issues that have been attracting international attention in the  sustainable development  debate: nuclear safety and in particular the 1994 Nuclear Safety Convention; the transport of nuclear materials by sea; radioactive waste management, in particular endorsing preparatory work towards an international convention on the safety of radioactive waste management; liability for nuclear damage; and conversion of nuclear materials to peaceful uses.
<P>
While consensus was reached on all the above issues, some were more difficult to resolve than others.
<P>
<B><I>Fuel cycle choices.</I></B> A few States which have made policy decisions not to develop nuclear power for the production of electricity were wary of strong endorsements of the technology. Some others resented what they considered interference with their national decision-making authority in the peaceful nuclear field. Still others pointed out that the NPT does not oblige a State to actively support the fuel cycle choices of another State Party. To cover these concerns, the Conference confirmed  "that each country's choices and decisionsin [this] field .. should be respected without jeopardizing its policies or international cooperation agreements and arrangements ... and its fuel-cycle policies".
<P> 
<B><I>Nuclear safety.</I></B> The importance of ensuring a high level of nuclear safety through rigorous national measures, international instruments, and international cooperation was recognized by all. The nuclear safety services provided by IAEA were fully endorsed and the 1994 Convention on Nuclear Safety was welcomed. States were urged to utilize its principles pending its entry into force. Steps to define the peer review process for the Convention were supported. Some States wished to welcome a voluntary extension of the Convention, or at least its safety objectives, to other civil nuclear activities. Consensus was reached on a recommendation to consider the possibility of further conventions that might strengthen safety in nuclear activities other than civil nuclear power plants.
<P>
<B><I>Safety of marine transport of nuclear material.</I></B> The group of small island developing States, supported by Australia, New Zealand, and several non-governmental organizations (NGOs), expressed particular concern about the safety of marine transport of nuclear material. A rather lengthy text was eventually worked out recognizing the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-level Nuclear Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships, and stressing the importance of ongoing work within IAEA to complement the Code.  The same group also introduced language noting that effective liability mechanisms are essential to provide compensation for nuclear-related damage that may occur during sea transport.
<P>
<B><I>Nuclear waste.</I></B>  The Conference recognized the need to prohibit dumping of radioactive waste and noted the 1994 amendment of the London Convention, 1972, by which sea dumping of all types of radioactive waste is prohibited. The Conference noted the particular importance of ensuring that possible effects on human health and the environment beyond national borders are taken into account in the management of all kinds of radioactive waste, civilian as well as military.
<P>
<B><I>Conversion of nuclear materials to peaceful uses.</I></B> The Conference recognized the problems of safety and contamination related to the discontinuation of nuclear operations formerly associated with nuclear-weapon programmes. It called for international assistance for remedial measures, safe resettlement of displaced populations, and restoration of economic productivity to affected areas, where appropriate. Further, the Conference acknowledged the existence of a special responsibility towards those people of former United Nations Trust Territories who have been adversely affected as a result of nuclear weapons tests.
<P>
<B><I>Liability.</I></B> Recognizing the need for completion of ongoing work in the field of nuclear liability within the IAEA and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Conference took note of the proposal to hold a diplomatic conference in the first quarter of 1996. The conference is to be convened to revise the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and provide an effective supplementary funding regime.
<P>
<B><I>Technical cooperation.</I></B> Differences among States on technical cooperation were mainly of emphasis rather than of substance. All commended the work of IAEA and agreed that the IAEA technical cooperation programme, in particular its new directions, should be fully supported. There was general concern about declining pledges and payments to the Technical Cooperation Fund. The developing countries stressed the need for more adequate and predictable funds and called for a  new financing method  to that end; they also wanted a more active role by IAEA in assisting developing countries in the development of nuclear power. Several supported the creation of the standing advisory group on technical assistance and cooperation and this was reflected in the final text. In view of the fact that many NPT Parties are not IAEA Member States, the Agency was encouraged to give special attention to the needs of least-developed countries and to look into ways it could extend technical assistance to non-members. 
<P>
As regards bilateral cooperation, the Conference regretted that some non-parties had been able to benefit from cooperation with NPT Parties that may have contributed to non-peaceful programmes and welcomed subsequent steps to rectify the situation. As in the past, preferential treatment to Parties to the Treaty was urged.
<P>
<B><I>Access to peaceful nuclear technology.</I></B>  Several supplier States pointed out that the main obstacles to transfers related to nuclear power were the lack of interest (because of availability of other energy sources), infrastructure or financing, rather than restrictions on technology transfer.  There was general agreement that non-proliferation measures should not be a pretext for restricted access as long as the recipient was Party to the NPT and accepted comprehensive IAEA safeguards. A number of countries, led by Iran and Malaysia, called for transparency and non-discrimination in export controls and an NPT forum for discussing nuclear technology transfers that was open to recipients as well as suppliers. The text finally agreed in Main Committee III called for all States to observe the legitimate rights of all NPT Parties to have full access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  Transfers made in conformity with Articles I, II, and III of the Treaty were to be encouraged and  undue constraints  eliminated. 
<P>
This issue would have been more divisive had it not been for the emerging consensus on an  enhanced  review process, which provides an opportunity for assessing progress in implementing the adopted Principles and Objectives.  
<P> 
<B><I>The non-issues.</I></B> Compared to heated debate in past Review Conferences, two issues were resolved with fewer words and more solidarity than might have been expected: prohibition of armed attacks against peaceful nuclear facilities, and Article V of the Treaty which deals with peaceful nuclear explosions. Armed attacks were dealt with succinctly as jeopardizing nuclear safety and raising concerns of international law on the use of force. 
<P> 
Regarding peaceful nuclear explosions, the Conference recorded that their potential benefits have neither materialized nor been demonstrated and on the contrary, serious concerns have been expressed about their environmental consequences. This was an important message which the quasi-totality of NPT Parties wished to pass on to the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in the context of ongoing negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. China alone resisted the reference to the CD, saying that it went beyond the review of the Treaty, but accepted the rest of the text. Eventually the message passed, albeit somewhat diluted with possible  future developments which should also be taken into account.
<P>
<B><I>Universality of NPT membership.</I></B> In the last area of its work, the Review of Article IX on universal membership of the NPT, Main Committee III agreed to a text that eventually was a key to the adoption of the final package, as it addressed the issue of non-parties in a way that was found acceptable by all. This issue was of particular concern to Middle East Parties.
<P>
The Australian delegation provided the original draft which became the basis for consensus on the following paragraph:  "The Conference particularly urges those non-parties to the Treaty which operate unsafeguarded sensitive nuclear facilities - India, Israel and Pakistan - to take such action [accede to NPT], and affirms the important contribution this would make to regional and global security."
<P>
If the measure of a Treaty's success is in its membership, the NPT regime is much stronger today than at its last Review in 1990. In 1990 there were 139 Parties, 84 of which participated in the Review Conference. France and China had not yet joined. By early 1995 there were 178 Parties, 175 of which participated in the NPT Conference. The accession of States such as South Africa and Argentina, as well as the former Soviet Republics, and the positive role played by them in their  first  Review Conference, created an atmosphere that was quite different from previous Conferences. The NPT Club had gone global. Just days after the Conference ended, Chile announced its accession to the Treaty.
<P>
<H3>The road ahead</H3>
<P>
Despite lack of agreement at the NPT Conference on a Final Declaration, the overall consensus is reflected in the package of decisions that was adopted.  It significantly incorporates strong support for IAEA roles, programmes, and plans. The Conference notably commended Agency efforts in areas of safeguards and the transfer of technology for peaceful applications of nuclear energy, particularly with respect to technical cooperation and nuclear safety, and it called for renewed efforts to ensure that the IAEA is equipped with adequate financial and human resources to meet effectively its responsibilities.
<P>
At a time when the international community is facing new demands and challenges in areas of nuclear verification and social and economic development, there is greater need than ever for strengthening the institutions engaged in these efforts.  In many respects, a window of opportunity exists for reinforcing the IAEA's roles and capabilities within the evolving global framework, something which was grasped clearly if judged from deliberations at the 1995 NPT Conference. However, as IAEA Director General Hans Blix has made clear, what will be achieved depends essentially on whether States are now prepared to match words with actions by granting the Agency the necessary political, technical, and financial support.
<P>
Which way the international community moves on the road ahead remains to be seen.

The Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation on Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was convened in New York from 17 April to 12 May 1995. Its significance was underscored by the participation of 175 of the Treaty's 178 States Parties and by the decision to extend the Treaty indefinitely. The dual purpose of the Conference was to review the operation of the Treaty and to decide upon its extension. Ambassador Jayantha Dhanapala, of Sri Lanka, was President of the Conference.
<P>
The Conference preparatory process, which had started in May 1993, was done in four sessions of the Preparatory Committee. Eleven background documents were accepted for transmission to the Conference, including three prepared by the IAEA. However, relatively little time was devoted to substantive discussions and no major issue were resolved before the Conference. The focus had been on preparation of the draft rules of procedure for the Conference, the most controversial rule of which was left for the Conference itself to resolve. This concerned the voting procedure on the extension decision, a question closely associated with the substantive issue of options for extension, both of which were eventually resolved in the last week of the Conference. The review of the Treaty's implementation was undertaken by three Main Committees with the following mandates:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B><I>Main Committee I: Disarmament and Security Issues</I></B>
<BR>
Review and implementation of Articles I and II (non-proliferation commitments), Article VI (nuclear and general disarmament commitments); and Article VII (nuclear-weapon-free zones as related to disarmament and security issues) and the related preambular paragraphs.
<P>
<LI>
<B><I>Main Committee II: Non-Proliferation. Safeguards, and Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones</I></B>
<BR>
Review of implementation of Article III (verification and IAEA safeguards); Articles I and II (non-proliferation commitments in relation to verification and peaceful uses of nuclear energy); and Article VII (nuclear-weapon-free zones). Role of the Treaty in promoting non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament, and peace and security. Measures to promote the Treaty's wider acceptance.
<P>
<LI>
<B><I>Main Committee III: Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy</I></B>
<BR>
Review of implementation of Article III (as regards application of safeguards in such a way as to avoid hampering the economic or technological development of Parties); Article IV (on promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy); and Article V (on peaceful applications of nuclear explosions) and related preambular paragraphs.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>IAEA Roles and Responsibilities.</B>  Under the NPT, 
the IAEA has been entrusted with the specific role as the international 
safeguards inspectorate and is generally recognized as the multilateral 
channel for the transfer of technology for peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. Responsibilities emanate from Articles III and IV, respectively. 
In practical terms, the Agency has roles in connection with a number 
of other Articles. In practice, the IAEA has been entrusted with verification 
pursuant to Articles VII (in the Treaty-based nuclear weapon free 
zones already established or in prospect) and to Article VI (in the 
context of safeguarding nuclear material deemed excess to US defense 
requirements.) Possible new roles include those emerging from completion 
of negotiations for a Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT); and the 
conclusion of an agreement banning the production of fissionable material 
for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosives.
<P>
In his statement to the Conference on 17 April 1995, IAEA Director General
Hans Blix described the important role which has been given to the IAEA in the
implementation and fulfilment of the NPT, the Agency's potential role in new
areas of nuclear arms control, and its extensive technical cooperation and
assistance activities. Background Documents prepared by the IAEA provided
detailed information to the Conference. IAEA staff further provided assistance
to the Committees, in clarifying issues as well as in providing service as
part of the Conference Secretariat.
<P>
<B>NPT Origins and Objectives. </B>Signed in 1968 and in force since 1970, the
NPT has been hailed as one of the great success stories of multilateral arms
control. Its main objectives are to halt the further spread of nuclear
weapons, to provide security for non-nuclear weapon States which have given up
the nuclear option, to create a climate where co-operation in the peaceful
uses of nuclear energy can be fostered, and to encourage good faith arms
control negotiations leading to the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.
While opinions differ among States as to how successful the NPT has been in
achieving these goals, most are of the view that the world is a safer place 
with the Treaty than it would be without it.
<P>
Considering what is at stake, the NPT is a rather simple 
document consisting of only 10 Articles, the longest of which is six 
paragraphs. The details of the verification of Treaty obligations 
are left for negotiation in the framework of the IAEA. These safeguards 
agreements and subsidiary arrangements go into much greater detail 
and constitute the Treaty's verification system.
<P>
The Treaty provides for periodic review conferences at 5-year intervals.  The
first one was thus held in 1975, followed by those convened in 1980, 1985 and
1990 in accordance with NPT provisions and resolutions by the United Nations
General Assembly. The 1995 Conference was specifically provided for in Article
X of the Treaty: "Twenty-five years after the entry into force of the Treaty,
a conference shall be convened to decide whether the Treaty shall continue in
force indefinitely, or shall be extended for an additional fixed period or
periods. This decision shall be taken by a majority of the Parties to the
Treaty.". 
<P>
<HR>

<A NAME=FOOTNOTE_1>
<H2>The Final Package of Decisions</H2></A>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The positive outcome of the NPT Conference was a package of three decisions: 
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Extension of the Treaty</B>. The Conference decided that, as a majority exists among States Party to the Treaty for its indefinite extension, in accordance with its Article X.2, the Treaty shall continue in force indefinitely.
<P>
<LI>
<B>Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament.</B> In 20 operative paragraphs, the Conference adopted principles and objectives in all relevant areas.  
<P>
<B><I>Universality:</I></B> Urgent priority was given to universal adherence to the NPT. 
<P>
<B><I>Non-Proliferation:</I></B> The NPT's vital role in preventing nuclear proliferation and reducing the danger of nuclear war was stressed, as well as the need to make every effort to implement the non-proliferation provisions in all their aspects. 
<P>
<B><I>Nuclear disarmament:</I></B> The commitments by nuclear-weapon-States to pursue nuclear disarmament negotiations in good faith were reaffirmed and those States were urged to fulfil their undertakings with determination. Specifically, the implementation of the following programme of action was stressed: completion of negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty no later than 1996, with utmost restraint on testing pending its entry into force; immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations for a cut-off agreement on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons; determined, systematic, and progressive efforts by nuclear-weapon States to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of their elimination. 
<P>
<B><I>Nuclear-weapon-free-zones (NWFZs):</I></B> The development of NWFZs and zones free of all weapons of mass destruction, especially in regions of tension such as the Middle East, was encouraged as a matter of priority.
<P>
<B><I> Security assurances: </I></B>Going beyond Security Council resolution 984 (1995) and the recent declarations by nuclear-weapon States on negative and positive assurances, consideration should be given to further steps that could take the form of an internationally binding instrument. 
<P>
<B><I>Safeguards: </I></B>Recognizing that the IAEA is the competent authority responsible to verify and assure compliance with the safeguards agreements under Article III of the NPT, the Conference stated that nothing should be done to undermine IAEA's authority; States parties that had not yet concluded safeguards agreements should do so without delay; decisions of the IAEA's Board of Governors for further strengthening the effectiveness of IAEA safeguards should be supported; acceptance of safeguards and legally binding non-proliferation commitments should constitute a precondition for new supply arrangements for transferring nuclear material or equipment or items specially designed for the processing, use, or production of special fissionable material; nuclear material transferred by nuclear-weapon States from military to civilian use should, as soon as practicable, be placed under IAEA's voluntary offer safeguards.
<P>
<B><I>Peaceful uses of nuclear energy: </I></B>Stressing the inalienable right of all parties to develop research, production, and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in accordance with NPT provisions, the Conference urged full implementation of undertakings to facilitate transfer of peaceful nuclear technology; preferential treatment for non-nuclear-weapon States Parties in all peaceful nuclear activities; transparency and dialogue in nuclear-related export controls;  maintenance of highest practical levels of nuclear safety, including in waste management, physical protection and transport of nuclear materials; and strict avoidance of attacks or threats of attack on peaceful nuclear facilities.
<P>
<B><I> Resources for IAEA: </I></B>The Conference urged that every effort should be made to ensure that the IAEA is equipped with adequate financial and human resources to meet effectively its responsibilities and that the Agency should intensify its efforts to find ways and means for funding technical assistance through predictable and assured resources.
<LI>
<B>Strengthening the Review Process. </B>In addition to the Review Conferences at 5-year intervals, it was decided that, beginning in 1997, the Preparatory Committee should hold a meeting in each of the three years prior to the Review Conference to consider the Principles and Objectives and ways to promote the full implementation of the Treaty.
<P>
<LI>
<B>Resolution on the Middle East. </B>The resolution reaffirms the importance of the early realization of universal adherence to the NPT and calls upon all States of the Middle East that have not yet done so to accede to the Treaty as soon as possible and to accept IAEA full-scope safeguards. It also endorses the aim and objectives of the Middle East peace process and calls upon States in the region to take practical steps in appropriate forums towards the establishment of a Middle East Zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. The resolution, which was adopted without a vote, was sponsored by the NPT depositary States: Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A first version was originally proposed by 14 members of the  League of Arab States expressing concern about Israel's unsafeguarded nuclear facilities and calling for a Middle East free of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. As other States resisted singling out Israel, a compromise was reached whereby the language agreed in the report of Main Committee III was referred to. That language had expressed concern about unsafeguarded sensitive nuclear facilities in India, Israel, and Pakistan.

<P>
<I>Marking its silver anniversary of service, the IAEA's International Nuclear Information System is carving out some new directions</I>
<P>
<A HREF=#author>
<B>by Joyce Amenta and Alexander Sorokin</B></A>
<HR>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>Boxed article: <A HREF=inisbox.html>International Nuclear Information System: New directions and partnerships</A></I>
</CENTER>
<P>
From the beginning, the collection and dissemination of information has been an important part of the IAEA's mandate. Indeed, the Agency is required by its Statute ".... to encourage the exchange among its members of information relating to the nature and peaceful uses of atomic energy and ... serve as an intermediary among its members for this purpose".
<P>
The birth of such a globally oriented nuclear information system, however, was some years in the making.  
<P> 
The first documented proposal on an international nuclear information system was made in 1966 by Dr. L.L. Isaev of the Soviet Union and Dr. R.K. Wakerling of the United States. Two years later, in 1968, a detailed systems study was carried out by a team consisting of experts from these two countries, plus the United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), and the IAEA. The team's report, which was the culmination of an intensive 2-year period of work of many consultants, formed the basis of a proposal submitted to the IAEA Board of Governors. At its meeting on 26 February 1969, the IAEA Board decided to .... approve the setting up of INIS on an operational basis as early as possible in 1970, and authorize the Director General to request the participation of Member States therein .....  Upon the proposal of the Governor from India, Mr. Trivedi, the Board also decided that In developing INIS, the Agency would as far as possible take note of the needs of developing countries.
<P>
Within that framework, the world's first truly international computerized system was born with its mission to produce and disseminate both a database containing records of the world's nuclear literature and full text of non-conventional literature on microfiche. INIS operations officially began in March 1970.
<P>
<H3> An information cooperative</H3>
<P>
INIS is a co-operative system between the Agency and its Member States including some international organizations. A distinguishing feature is the decentralized operational philosophy. Each Member State participating in INIS scans the scientific literature published within its national boundaries, identifies items that fall within the subject scope of the system, prepares standardized descriptions of these, and sends the descriptions, in many cases together with a copy of the original piece of literature, to the Agency.  At IAEA headquarters, the incoming information is checked and merged into a single file so as to create a comprehensive bibliographic database. A copy of the full text of non-conventional literature (e.g., research reports and conference papers) is microfiched and stored in a central collection. Copies of the database and microfiche are delivered to the Member States for their use in providing information services to end-users.
<P>
Each Member State is represented in INIS by a Liaison Officer officially appointed by the appropriate national authority. Jointly with the IAEA Secretariat, the Liaison Officers are responsible for the day-to-day management and smooth running of the system. Each year they come together at a three- to four-day consultative meeting convened by the IAEA to review the progress achieved by INIS during the previous 12 months and make recommendations for its future development. 
<P>
<B>Far-reaching benefits. </B>The decentralized approach to input preparation and output dissemination yields valuable benefits. It results in comprehensive coverage of nuclear literature, effective handling of information in different languages, and highly satisfactory services for users of the information in each participating country.  
<P> 
Spectacular growth has taken place in participation by Agency Member States. In 1970, at the commencement of the system, 38 countries indicated their willingness to participate. By the beginning of 1995, the number of countries had grown to 90. 
<P>
In April 1970, the initial output product of the new International Nuclear Information System was distributed. In the first 2 or 3 years the amount of information collected and redistributed was relatively small. Gradually, however, the system's organization took shape on an international basis and by 1973 the number of items processed per year amounted to 56,700, about twice as many as the combined total of processed items from the previous 3 years. From 1974 on, INIS had achieved a steady operation, processing annually 60,000 to 70,000 documents. By 1976, INIS was considered the world's comprehensive abstracting and indexing service in the field of atomic energy. The total amount of information that has been collected in the 25 years that INIS has been operating now consists of over 1.8 million items, with an annual increase of 80-85,000 documents.
<P>
The usefulness of the system to end users -- in particular decision makers, scientists and engineers -- lies in access to information related to in all the areas of interest and activities of the IAEA covered by the subject scope of the INIS database. The subjects include nuclear power, nuclear safety, radiation protection, safeguards, nuclear applications, and related topics. 
<P>
<H3> Choice of products</H3>
<P>
INIS provides useful products to Member States at different stages of development. The policy of benefits for all is met by producing a carefully balanced range of products and services. INIS information is available in different forms and the user may select the most appropriate forms for his facilities and users. INIS output products and services currently consist of:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <I>INIS Atomindex</I>, a printed journal with full bibliographic references and abstracts for all literature reported to the system. There are 24 issues per year.
<P>
<LI> Magnetic tape, the machine-readable equivalent of <I>Atomindex.</I> It is distributed upon request either 12 or 24 times a year.
<P>
<LI> CD-ROM. The set consists of five archival disks covering 1976 through 1994 and one current disk which is updated four times per year.
<P>
<LI> Document delivery services. Full text of non-conventional literature reported to the system, distributed on microfiche 24 times a year. 
<P>
<LI> On-line services. The INIS database is available on-line from the Agency's computer in Vienna as well as from hosts in Member States to users anywhere who have the appropriate technical capability.
</UL>
<P>
<B>High levels of demand. </B>The most powerful criteria that can be used in the assessment of any information service is customer satisfaction. The usage of information products and services is one of these indicators.
<P>
Four hundred sets of printed <I>INIS Atomindex </I>are distributed annually to national libraries, research institutes, and universities in more than 100 countries. About 95,000 copies of microfiche containing full text of non-conventional literature are distributed annually to information centres, libraries, and individuals in 54 countries. Twenty-one countries receive <I>Atomindex</I> on magnetic tape which is used by information centres to disseminate INIS information internally. About 70,000 searches of the INIS database were performed in 1994 by those who have a network connection.  Additionally, 173 sets of the INIS database on CD-ROM are currently distributed annually to collective and individual users in 85 countries. (A large number of searches are made on CD-ROM disks.) These statistics would seem to confirm the high usage of INIS output products.
<P>
<H3> Transferring expertise and systems</H3>
<P>
One major advantage of a decentralized system is that it tends to stimulate the improvement of the national information infrastructure as well as promote the transfer of modern information technology. 
<P>
In order to assist  Member States in building up their information processing capabilities, INIS has established a regular training programme of seminars usually held every second year, a fellowship training scheme, and advisory services to national centres.
<P>
Over the years, INIS expertise has provided and facilitated information technology transfer; the development of information skills, and the adoption and use of standards for maximizing information exchange. Information technology transfer is achieved, for example, by both INIS training and IAEA technical co-operation projects. These activities assure the establishment or upgrading of INIS National Information Centres, and provide necessary information technologies. They also facilitate formal and on-the-job information skills development. To date, INIS has conducted 48 training events with 1500 trainees.  
<P>
Through an early regional technical cooperation project, the INIS network was strengthened. The project resulted in information centres being established or improved in 14 countries in Latin America, in the training of more than 50 staff, and the introduction of new information technologies. As a result, these countries can now function collectively and the exchange of information has strengthened ties within the region. Currently, there are three active regional technical co-operation projects in Asia and the Pacific, Europe, and West Asia. In addition to regional projects, INIS has been involved with 16 national technical cooperation projects, four of which are currently still active (Belarus, Lebanon, Mongolia, and Sri Lanka).
<P>
The benefits of such projects are the improved transfer of scientific and technical nuclear information to the recipient countries, strengthened capabilities of national information centres, and expansion of the INIS network as an information co-operative. Each participating Member State, in providing information to INIS, gets a return on its investment and has access to a larger nuclear information database to which all Members contribute. 
<P>
The basic organizational principles of INIS are still valid after 25 years. INIS has been used as a model for other United Nations information systems, notably for agricultural sciences and technology (AGRIS) established by FAO. From its inception, AGRIS adopted the basic principles, standards, and procedures from INIS, even to the extent of utilizing the same computer software.
<P>
INIS technical standards and rules for processing literature have also been adopted by two other international information systems. They are the Energy Technology Data Exchange system established in 1987 by countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; and a document delivery system set up 15 years ago by the European Association for Grey Literature Exploitation which covers grey literature produced in European countries.
<P>
Indeed, through its adoption and development of international information processing standards, INIS has contributed significantly towards improved compatibility and interconnection between information systems.
<P>
Systems such as INIS, which capitalize on information technology transfer, information skills development, and the use of standards for information management and exchange have literally paved the way for the global information highway envisioned today.
<P>
<H3> Future developments</H3>
<P>
The agenda for the further development of INIS reflects the changes that have occurred in the information industry and in the nuclear community. The information technology environment has changed, technology for electronic data exchange has been developing at a very rapid pace, the economics of information services at the national centres have changed, and the needs for nuclear information are also different from those that existed 25 years ago when INIS was established.
<P>
The main technological developments lie in telecommunication networks, digitization of information, and miniaturization of electronic equipment.
<P>
Networking, epitomized by the emergence of the Internet, has established the information highways along which flow data, information, and computing power so that access to these commodities spans time and space.
<P>
The digitization of all types of information (text, images, sound and video) provides new opportunities for information delivery. A growing portion of the total information productivity will consist of information in electronic form, especially full-text databases and images.
<P>
Miniaturization of equipment allows the information user to be more mobile and places large amounts of information at the user's fingertips.
<P>
There is considerable confidence in the technological feasibility of new products and services but whether they are economically feasible should be studied. The production and costs have to be acceptable and should be compared with the costs of existing media and the added value of the new technologies.  
<P>
A careful evaluation of the environment, background needs and training of intended information users is crucial. Information which is distributed by electronic means is not yet equally accessible to all countries. The outcome of these considerations should make it possible to provide information which meets the needs of users more adequately.
<P>
<B>New missions.</B> Besides the issues related to changing user needs and rapidly developing technology, there are some issues related to international co-operation and economics of information activity. The major one is database building versus access to existing sources. For a considerable number of countries, the INIS database is the single and only source of readily accessible electronic information. In others, mainly the industrialized countries, nuclear and nuclear related information can be obtained from other databases. This issue was addressed by the Advisory Committee for INIS at its meeting in December 1994. The discussion resulted in a proposed new Mission Statement for INIS and recommendations on the development for the next 5-year period.
<P>
The new mission for INIS stresses not only the continued building of the database, but the need for INIS to provide access to mission-related information not encompassed by its own database but available elsewhere. The technology to provide such access already exists. The institutional arrangements need to be established.
<P>
As its founders envisaged a quarter century ago, the development of the International Nuclear Information System must go hand-in-hand with evolving technology and the changing information needs of the IAEA's Member States.

<P>
A phenomenon without precedent, the world-wide computer network called Internet has gone from a little-known academic and research network to become the talk of cyberspace. Turn to any issue of any popular weekly journal. You will find an article about international computer communications and computers you can reach via the Internet. Vinton G. Cerf, president of the Internet Society, believes that a fertile mixture of high-risk ideas, stable research funding, visionary leadership, extraordinary grass-roots cooperation, and vigorous entrepreneurship has led to an emerging global information infrastructure unlike anything seen before.
<P>
Expectations run high, and opportunities are exciting. Yet as organizations are learning, reading about the Internet is easier than using it in a concerted, reliable, and professional way.  
<P> 
The IAEA started developing its Internet capabilities in 1993. (IAEA's Internet address: iaeo@iaea1.iaea.or.at) Further development is designed to improve capabilities for meeting internal information needs, and to expand access to the Agency's extensive range of databanks and information systems within its Member States. 
<P>
<B>Internet's origins.</B> All electronic communications between computers rely on precisely defined structures of signals, called protocols , that define the contents of the message, where it came from, and where it is going. In the early 1970s, a protocol was developed at Stanford University in the United States that allows multiple networks to be interconnected in a flexible and dynamic way. This protocol, called TCP/IP, together with the USA's research network, was the basis for the Internet. A decision in the early 1980s supported the creation of regional networks that would aggregate traffic and feed it to the backbone networks. Thus the ability to support global connections through local networks was born.
<P>
Over the past 12 years, the number of host computers on the Internet has increased from 200 to 2.5 million, an annual growth rate of 120%. Nearly 8 million people can use complete Internet services, and more than 27 million people can use it to exchange electronic mail. 
<P>
Internet services range from relatively simple to highly sophisticated. The Agency uses a commercial electronic mail package for its in-house electronic mail. With the addition of a gateway computer linking this mail network to the Internet, IAEA staff can send and receive mail from any worldwide location via the Internet. They do not need to learn much more than how to code the receiver's electronic mail address. The Internet serves as the interchange medium so that messages originating in different systems can be understood. The next stage of Internet services is the direct connection to a remote computer. This connection can take two forms: either the ability to locate and copy files from the remote computer to  your computer, or the ability to log on to the remote computer as a local terminal.
<P>
The Agency added these services in early 1994. Called FTP and TELNET respectively, they require special skills and software on each user's desktop computer. About 400 people in the Agency have these services. The IAEA also established an FTP computer for public access in early 1994, so that people worldwide could download publicly available Agency files. In some cases, organizations are allowed to deposit data onto the Agency's FTP computer for retrieval by IAEA staff. The highest levels of Internet services are the so-called "special servers" , namely Gopher and the World Wide Web, or WWW. These services, developed by the University of Minnesota in the United States and the European Centre for Particle Research (CERN) in Geneva respectively, add descriptive information to the files that are available, making their access easier for the user. Gopher is a text-based interface that does not require sophisticated computers. The WWW is a full multi-media graphical interface that includes the ability to jump between documents automatically by clicking on highlighted words, i.e. hypertext links. The WWW requires more communications bandwidth and more powerful desktop computers, but it is already the most heavily used Internet service. It is simple to use and the documents you find are displayed immediately on your screen and can be either copied or printed directly.
<P>
The IAEA added WWW services to its spectrum of Internet services in early 1995, and most of the users of FTP, TELNET, and Gopher have now migrated to WWW. In June 1995, the Agency announced the worldwide availability of its WWW computer, and the <I>IAEA's World Atom  </I>was opened to the public. <A HREF=lothar.html><I>(See box.)</I></A>
<P>
<B>The Web inside the IAEA.</B> Agency staff need access to a wide range of information to do their jobs effectively. Much of this information is not available directly in-house, but comes from other sources. The Internet provides an efficient way of obtaining it. Almost all nuclear research institutes worldwide are connected to the Internet. Large institutes, such as the Los Alamos Laboratories in the United States, have significant collections of documents on-line that are searchable via WWW. The documents can be copied to a desktop in Vienna in a short time. 
<P>
The Agency also needs a medium for making administrative information more readily available to all staff. The in-house use of the Internet provides this medium, reaching all parts of the IAEA despite the use of different network configurations. Material such as the administrative  manual, Secretariat notes, and desk-to-desk circulars can be made available via WWW to the desktops. The technology was put into place in the second quarter of 1995, and now the procedures for its use are being established. 
<P>
<B>The UN and the Internet. </B> Since 1990, United Nations organizations and specialized agencies have been working on ways to allow Member States more access to databases and documents electronically in a consistent, coordinated manner. The Information Systems Coordinating Committee (ISCC), which reports to the Advisory Committee on Coordination, is responsible for this task. Recently its Task Force on Information Access and Dissemination established a number of principles. Among them are the UN's reliance on the Internet as the primary (although not sole) means of computer communication with Member States; the need for all UN organizations to develop information access policies and procedures; and the use of the International Computing Centre in Geneva to provide a starting point for UN-wide information searches via the WWW. 
<P>
The IAEA has started a pilot project to allow Member State missions in Vienna access to numerous Agency databases via connection to its network. It also is making documents electronically available to Member States in connection with the IAEA's General Conference in September 1995.
<P>
<B> Internet issues. </B>The IAEA's Central Computer Services are continuing to work on four issues that affect the public's use of the Internet. These concern questions of security, searching, document dissemination, and capacity. 
<P>
The security issue is one of providing access  to public information without putting the in-house network at risk. The solution now being used is based on establishing a special "firewall"  computer between the publicly accessible computer and the protected in-house network.  Agency staff can access the remote Internet computers through the firewall, but users of remote computers cannot gain access.
<P>
Searching for information is still a complex issue. Various commercial and university-created products exist. The Agency is using one such system to allow searching of bibliographic databases, and is investigating which products can provide good searching of all WWW information. 
<P>
Document dissemination is a time-consuming task that needs to be automated as far as possible. Most IAEA documents are available in  word processing form. Putting these documents onto the WWW computer requires translating  these documents into the WWW's text processing language, the Hypertext General Mark-up Language, or HTML. Tools for this conversion are still being developed worldwide. Text that refers to other documents needs to be marked and the names of the links must be coded.
<P>
Finally, the issue of capacity means that the IAEA needs to watch the growth of the Internet worldwide and the demand for networking capacity closely. At usage rates that double annually, available networking bandwidth can be exhausted quickly, requiring additional investment to maintain quality. Today, the IAEA pays a flat annual fee for Internet access to a commercial company that links it to the Internet. Such fee systems may not be sufficient in the future, and many organizations, such as the Internet Society,are already discussing different charging modalities.
<P>
<B>Expanding on-line services.</B> Over the past four decades, the IAEA has developed a range of on-line databases for public and technical users. They include the Power Reactor Information System; the International Nuclear Information System; the International Information System for the Agricultural Sciences and Technology, jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); the Nuclear Data Information System; and the Atomic and Molecular Data Information System.
<P>
However Internet's future unfolds, the IAEA's acquired experience will prove invaluable in keeping up with rapid developments in the computer and telecommunications fields. As importantly, the work will guide ongoing efforts to reinforce the IAEA's capabilities for providing information more productively and efficiently. The next stages of development will help define the IAEA's role on the emerging global nuclear information highway.

<FONT SIZE=+2>E</FONT>nvironmental and health-related impacts of different energy systems, including those associated with the production of electricity, have become significant national and global issues. Current debates, for example, centre on the health effects of pollution, environmental damage due to acidification of forests and lakes, the safety of nuclear power plants and radioactive waste management, and the potential risks of global climate change induced by increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
<P>
All fuel chains within the electricity generation system involve some health risks and lead to some environmental impacts. This fact -- together with the needs of many countries to define their energy and electricity programmes for the coming decades -- stands behind a growing interest in the application of improved data, tools, and techniques for comparative assessment of different electricity generation options, particularly from environmental and human health viewpoints.
<P> 
At the international level, the need to design and implement sustainable strategies in the electricity sector has been stressed throughout the 1990s at major global meetings. This was the case in 1991 at the Senior Expert Symposium on Electricity and the Environment (Helsinki), in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, Rio de Janeiro), and at the 15th Conference of the World Energy Council (Madrid). The Agenda 21, adopted by UNCED, emphasizes that environmental and development concerns should be integrated into the decision-making process. The Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), prepared in 1993 and 1994, highlights that options for alleviating the risks of global climate change should be comprehensively assessed and that adequate policies should be implemented to promote the most efficient technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>
In the electricity sector, the essential goal of sustainable strategies is to provide the energy services required for supporting economic growth and improving quality of life, especially in developing countries, while minimizing the health and environmental impacts of human activities.
<P>
In mid-1992, the IAEA and a number of other organizations initiated an inter-agency joint project on databases and methodologies for comparative assessment of different energy sources for electricity generation, known as DECADES. Its objective is to enhance capabilities for incorporating health and environmental issues into comparative assessments of different electricity generation chains and strategies in the process of energy planning and decision-making.
<P> 
The project is carried out jointly by the IAEA, the European Commission (EC), the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD/World Bank), the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD/NEA), the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Several other international organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO), are contributing to the project within their areas of expertise. The Project Secretariat, comprised of representatives of the four Vienna-based organizations (IAEA, IIASA, OPEC, and UNIDO), co-ordinates activities within the scope and objectives defined by the project's Joint Steering Committee (JSC).
<P> 
This article reviews the major elements of the DECADES project and reports on selected activities and results to date. It also looks at future  developments, including the October 1995 international conference at which results will be more fully presented and reviewed.
<P>
<H3>Major elements of DECADES</H3>
<P>
The DECADES project addresses some, but not all, of the issues involved in comparative assessments of different electricity generation options and strategies. The project principally aims toward providing comprehensive information about different energy chains for electricity generation -- i.e., fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable sources -- and user friendly tools for accessing, handling, and processing key information needed for planning and decision-making purposes.
<P> 
The project's first phase, from mid-1992 to mid-1995, focuses on the development of databases and analytical tools for electricity system planning and decision support studies, and their concrete application in national case studies. Upon completion of this first phase, it is expected that the participating organizations will consider the feasibility of jointly undertaking further activities in this field in order to address certain issues more comprehensively. It is also expected that the exploratory national case studies will be extended with the objective of fully testing and demonstrating the use of the DECADES tools in planning and decision-making for the electricity sector.
<P>
The major components of the project are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>establishment of databases, in particular of a comprehensive technology inventory, providing characteristics of energy chains for electricity generation, from fuel extraction to waste management, covering technical, economic, health and environmental aspects;
<LI>development of an information system (computer software) for user-oriented access to electronic databases, allowing retrieval, display, and handling of the data;
<LI>development of a software package integrating technical, economic, environmental, and health aspects into electricity system analysis and expansion planning;
<LI>compilation and review of methodologies, analytical models, and computerized tools for comparative assessment, with emphasis on those tools that may be used in the planning and decision-making process for the electricity sector;
<LI>carrying out of some case studies addressing specific national or regional issues, with the primary objective of illustrating the applicability of the data bases and computerized tools in the planning and decision-making process.
</UL>
<P>
<A HREF=decproducts.html><H3>DECADES products</H3></A>
<P>
Products developed within the project's framework -- i.e., computer tools, including databases and publications -- are designed for use by energy analysts and planners in national institutes, in particular in developing countries and international organizations. However, they will also be relevant for use by a broader audience of individuals and groups interested in technical, economic, health, and environmental aspects of electricity generation options. In this connection, special emphasis has been given in the design of the products to ensure coherence, consistency, and transparency of the data and tools.
<P>
Since the DECADES products are developed and maintained by international organizations, they will be distributed upon request to non-profit international organizations and national institutes. Workshops and seminars will be organized  to provide opportunities for exchange of information and experience between users and with the developers of the databases and computer tools.
<P>
The products are intended to be of particular relevance for planning and implementing electricity system expansion strategies in developing countries. These countries, which are experiencing the highest rates of growth in electricity demand and rapidly increasing environmental problems, need reliable information and easy-to-use tools to design and implement economically competitive and environmentally sound strategies for electricity supply. The generic data provided by the DECADES project, as well as the computer structure for collecting, storing, and processing specific national data, will be useful in the process of establishing a country-specific framework for electricity planning. The methodologies that will be reviewed and demonstrated could also serve as a basis for comprehensive and coherent approaches that could be adapted to each specific national context.
<P>
For international organizations, the products can be useful tools in that they reflect a broad consensus on reference data and methodological approaches which could  be used for analysis and studies in different countries and regions. The tools could be applied within the framework of their technical assistance programmes to developing countries.
<P>
The transparency and user friendliness of the DECADES products are key aspects of their design. These features should facilitate their use by energy/electricity system analysts and senior executives, as well as by a broader public less familiar with technical issues. In this connection, the dissemination of the databases and reports is intended to lead to a better understanding of the implications of electricity generation choices and policies.
<P>
The products developed up to April 1995 and already distributed to a number of selected users include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a database management system (DBMS), distributed in electronic format for use on personal computers (PCs) together with a user's manual. The package includes: a Reference Technology Data Base (RTDB) containing information on different energy chains for electricity generation, including their technical and economic parameters, emissions, and other residuals at each level of the chains; a computer structure for establishing a user/country specific database; and a graphical user interface for accessing, displaying, and handling the information contained in the databases.
<LI>a software package (DECPAC Phase I) for electricity system planning, which is provided as executable code with a user's manual.  The package runs on PCs and includes the supporting databases developed within the project, i.e. the RTDB and Country Specific Data Bases (CSDBs) whenever they have been established by national scientific teams. 
<LI>a document on computer tools for comparative assessment of electricity generation options and strategies. It provides information on selected PC-based computer tools currently available or expected to be available in the near future;
<LI>interim reports on case studies being carried out to assess and compare alternative strategies in the electricity sector, taking into account their technical, economic, health, and environmental aspects. The studies illustrate the use, in the planning and decision-making process, of the databases and computer tools developed and reviewed within the DECADES project.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>DECADES databases</H3>
The databases within the DECADES project cover not only currently available technologies but also advanced technologies expected to be commercially deployed within the next two or three decades. They are designed for use on personal computers with an accompanying database management system.
<P>
<B>Technology databases.</B>  The technology inventory databases contain information on all levels of different energy chains, i.e., fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable energy sources, for electricity generation. Data on fuel characteristics and abatement technologies are included. Transmission and end-use of electricity are not covered in the first phase of the project, but the database structure and management system are flexible enough to allow for incorporating these levels at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Country Specific Data Bases (CSDBs).</B>  CSDBs are being developed by national institutes mainly under research or scientific contracts with the IAEA. Data on electricity generation technologies in a given country or region are collected by national teams and stored in a computer structure identical to that of RTDB. Technical support and guidance are provided by the IAEA on the use of the DBMS for establishing country-specific databases. Furthermore, the information contained in RTDB can be used for complementing and checking the consistency of the data available in the country.
<P> 
<B>Vendor database.</B> As part of the DECADES technology inventory, comprehensive information on state-of-the-art electricity generation chain facilities offered by manufacturers would be highly valuable for users. Recognizing this need, the JSC recommended to establish an Extended Vendor Specific Data Base providing quantitative and qualitative information on commercial equipment and facilities currently available from vendors. Its establishment will be considered during the second phase of the DECADES project.
<P>
<B>Toxicology database.</B> Data on toxicology profiles for pollutants released at different levels of energy chains for electricity generation are needed for assessing health impacts resulting from the emissions. Although the first phase of the project will not address comprehensively the issues of health impact assessment, the JSC recommended to collect and structure the data that will be required for this purpose at an early stage of the project. The prototype Toxicology Data Base (TOXDB) is based largely upon an existing one established by UNEP and WHO. It covers most chemical products emitted at all levels of the energy chains for electricity generation. Information on the toxicity of radiochemicals has been collected to complement this existing data and to cover dose-effect relationships for all significant pollutants. TOXDB will also contain textual information related to toxicology profiles, as well as standards and regulations in different countries on emission limits.
<P>
<B>Health and environmental database.</B> A database on Health and Environmental Impacts of Energy Systems for Electricity Generation (HEIES) also will be developed. It will be used for storing results from selected studies and measurements related to health and environmental impacts from different electricity generation chain facilities and systems.
<P>
<H3>Analytical tools</H3>
<P>
Although a number of methodologies, models, and tools exist or are under development for comparative assessment of energy/electricity supply options and strategies, no single methodology, model, or tool incorporates all the elements needed for a comprehensive approach. Potential users thus need information on the different approaches, and their capabilities and limitations. Under the DECADES project, a review was carried out of methodologies and models for comparative assessment of analytical tools for use on personal computers that are available at little or no cost. A detailed project document that catalogues available tools has been prepared. Additionally, a group of international experts from the IAEA and World Bank is preparing a reference book focusing on the incorporation of economic, social, health, and environmental aspects into policy-making for the power sector.
<P>
Within the DECADES project,  software was develped to provide an integrated tool for comparative assessment of electricity options and strategies in the process of system expansion planning. The software package (DECPAC Phase 1) implemented in the project's first phase is intended to be a screening tool for preliminary assessment and selection of options that might be investigated further. It includes analysis modules -- covering electricity systems, primary energy supply, and the environment -- that have been drawn from methodological approaches and computer codes developed by the IAEA in co-operation with the Argonne National Laboratory in the United States. These include the Wien Automatic System Planning model (WASP) and the Energy and Power Evaluation Program package (ENEP).
<P>
<H3>Case studies</H3>
<P>
Within the DECADES framework, the scope and objective of the case studies were defined by national scientific teams. They are focusing on concrete issues that have to be addressed by analysts and planners in support of the decision-making process.
<P>
The IAEA has established two Co-ordinated Research Programmes (CRPs), which provide an organizational and support framework for national institutes from Member States wishing to undertake case studies in their respective countries. Other studies are supported by the IAEA through other mechanisms, while some are being carried out by other organizations participating in the DECADES project, e.g., ESCAP, IBRD, and UNIDO. These studies also will contribute to the overall set of DECADES case studies.
<P>
The two CRPs were initiated over the past 2 years. The first one, started in December 1993, focuses on case studies to assess and compare the potential role of nuclear power and other options in reducing emissions and residuals from electricity generation. Research contracts and agreements have been signed with 19 Member States. The second CRP, launched in April 1994, is directed at comparative health and environmental risks of nuclear and other energy systems. Eleven scientific teams are participating in this research. Reports from each case study will be prepared by national teams and published in the DECADES Project Document Series.
<P>
<H3>Milestones and future directions</H3>
<P>
In October 1995, the IAEA and its DECADES partners will convene the International Symposium on Electricity, Health and the Environment: Comparative Assessment in Support of Decision Making. The meeting marks a major milestone of the DECADES project. Technical and panel sessions on various topics will draw upon results of the DECADES project, as well as other international and national studies. Computer tools available to decision makers for carrying out comparative assessment studies also will be demonstrated. The symposium thus offers to provide a valuable base of comprehensive information on issues related to assessing electricity options.
<P>
The results obtained within the DECADES project so far are encouraging. Many experts, in particular from developing countries, have expressed interest in the project. More than 15 national institutes are already using the RTDB computer structure. Moreover, many of the same countries have requested training on the use of DECPAC.
<P>
In 1995, work plans are placing emphasis on maintenance, enhancement, and dissemination of DECADES products and tools. The work includes a systematic expert review of data contained in RTDB and the preparation of more extensive numerical, textual, and pictorial information. More workshops also are being organized to assist national teams in establishing country-specific databases. Also under way is the final design and implementation of the databases covering toxicological and health and environmental information, and the further improvement of the DECADES software for electricity system planning, DECPAC.
<P>
Most tasks within DECADES draw upon on-going programmes of the project's participating organizations. In this connection, the IAEA in years ahead is planning to continue its emphasis on DECADES-related activities through its programme on comparative assessment of nuclear power and other options. Important ingredients of the programme are national and regional technical co-operation projects designed to assist countries in applying computer tools and models for analyzing their electricity needs and for effectively assessing the risks and benefits of specific technologies.
