MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> asks who 
holds the right to raise our nation's children today.  Inherently it is 
the parents' rights to decide their children's upbringing and education, but 
these essential rights are being challenged across America.
<p>
For example, just last summer Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Earls[?] were refused the 
right to the results of AIDS tests and cervical cancer tests given to
their 13- and 15-year-old daughters.  Who held back those results?
The same Georgia middle school that condoned a counselor driving
the girls to a health clinic during school hours where they were
tested, given condoms, and prescriptions for birth control pills
without their parents' knowledge.  We will find out why this scenario
is becoming increasingly common and how some are attempting to
combat increasing government control over our children's lives.
<p>
But first, let's hear about the current buzz in Washington and
across the country about the first Republican primary.  I had
the opportunity to discuss the Iowa and New Hampshire results
with Family Research Council's Bob Morrison, who is special assistant
to Gary Bauer.  Bob provides insights into what the primaries
mean to you and what they could mean to our country's upcoming
elections.  With Super Tuesday just around the corner, you probably
won't read Bob's perspectives in your local newspaper or hear
it on your favorite newscasts.  So stay with us as <i>Straight Talk</i>
takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>

</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, thank you so much for being with us here on Behind the 
Headlines. A lot of attention is being paid to Iowa and New Hampshire right
now.  Is that attention deserved?  Historically, have these states
been make or break?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Sure they have.  They are very, very important throughout 
their history.  It is a way for a system that has grown large and unwieldy 
to sort of break it down into a manageable size, Iowa being part of the Midwest, 
New Hampshire representing sort of the flinty Yankee tradition.  They are 
still states where you can do politicking on a retail basis, at least
until this year, where it wasn't always a question of how many
ads can you throw up on television but how many people can you
meet in lodge halls and church basements and high school auditoriums.
How many people can you just go to a meeting among farmers? 
So both states are manageable, and that is why they play a critical
role.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think there is something special in
the mix of midwestern practicality and family values and the northeastern
frugality that makes it really important that we be in those two
particular states, or do the candidates really illuminate themselves?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Well, there is a conservative bent, in that sense.
In the Republican caucuses and primaries in those states, there
is a tendency toward a more conservative side, which the Republican
party has seemed to represent over time.  In the Democratic party,
that is not necessarily the case.  In the Democratic party, some
notable liberals have done well in Iowa and in New Hampshire.
So those are critical points.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How have they evolved in importance?  Well, in this year in 
particular we have had what is called a front-loading of the primary and 
caucus system, so that candidates have really been out there campaigning 
furiously for well over a year.  Some of those candidates who announced
for president in the Republican side announced six months to nine
months earlier than they typically did in years past.  There is
going to be a fury of campaign primaries -- mostly primaries from
this point on -- between now and the end of March.
<p>
So it is very possible by mid-April, by tax time, we may see a winner emerge
who has amassed more than half of the delegates that are necessary
to be nominated on the Democratic side and on the Republican side.
Now it is assumed that President Clinton has no opposition, no
declared opposition, that they will just sort of routinely go
through the motions and he will wrap up the victories he needs
to assure his renomination.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One rather schizophrenic criticism of the process is that on the 
one hand Iowa and New Hampshire make really liberal Democratic choices and on 
the other hand very conservative Republican choices.  Is that fair?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  The activists in both parties tend toward being liberal
in the Democratic party and conservative in the Republican party.
That is the tendency.  Now we all know that there are well-known
conservative Democrats:  Governor Casey of Pennsylvania, Sam Nunn
of Georgia.
<p>
There are conservatives in the Democratic party; there
are liberals in Republican party:  Arlen Specter, Governor William
Weld.  So to the extent that these folks still get elected in
various offices, you cannot say that the parties are monochrome,
they're all one thing or all the other.  But this is the first
opportunity to bring out some of those seething activists who
have been waiting to get in there and pitch in every four years,
the people who may have a terminal case of Potomac fever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Every political year, people like to complain about
the limited choices available to them, and yet the political process
does seem to continue.  How have some of our greatest leaders
fared in the Iowa and New Hampshire process?
<p>
MR. MORRISON: They are relatively modern vintage, so basically Ronald 
Reagan, as I mentioned, did not do well in Iowa in 1980, came smashing 
back to beat not only George Bush but Bob Dole and a host of other
contenders in 1980, and Reagan was basically the man to beat after
the New Hampshire primary.  In 1984, the New Hampshire primary,
the Republicans, Reagan was just renominated.  There was no contest
really.  But for the Democrats it was a very big fight, and that
is when Gary Hart came forward.
<p>
As far as presidents who have been elected, as I mentioned, Reagan did 
well in New Hampshire. We also had Carter doing well in the Iowa caucuses. 
Carter came on to win the New Hampshire primary in 1976.  Bush, of course,
coming out of New Hampshire in 1988, captured the nomination and
went on to win the election.
<p>
A key New Hampshire contest was four years ago for Bill Clinton.  Bill 
Clinton was in serious trouble in his candidacy.  There were stories about 
draft evasion. There were stories about womanizing.  He was in very, very 
serious political shape, but he was able to score a number two slot.  He did 
not win the New Hampshire primary.  Neighboring Senator Paul Tsongas,
former senator from Massachusetts, actually won, but this is that
expectations game.
<p>
Clinton was able to come up so close to Tsongas in New Hampshire that 
he virtually came out and proclaimed himself the comeback kid and 
essentially was able to reenergize his campaign coming out of New Hampshire. 
In a short period of time, people thought that Clinton had won New Hampshire.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Prior to the influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, most political 
candidates were chosen by party bosses in the back room.  Now we have this
more democratic approach, Iowa and New Hampshire, I think, very
powerful in that.  Are we better served today by electing our
candidates in primaries or by the old system?
<p>
MR. MORRISON: If you had a national primary, then the other things that 
people don't like, the concentration on money, would only be that much
more intense.  You would have to raise huge amounts of money to
mount a campaign nationwide.  Even as we have it, with what's
left of Super Tuesday, several southern states holding primaries
on the same day, as we come out of New Hampshire you are going
to see that a lot of people have to raise a huge amount of money
very quickly.
<p>
The odds will then tend to favor those who have already raised a huge 
amount of money. President Clinton obviously is in good shape for 
fundraising.  Senator Dole is in good shape for fundraising.  But it 
is not absolute.  The interesting thing is what these states do in spite of 
big money, and the example that we have this year is the fate of Senator Gramm.
<p>
Senator Gramm once said that he had the best friend in politics that you 
could have, ready money, and he had said that you needed to have $20
million to even get into this game.  He didn't even get to the
first primary, and that's not the only time that has happened.
Texas Governor John Connelly, former Secretary of Treasury, he
raised a massive amount of money in his campaign -- I believe
it was close to $10 million -- back in 1980, and yet Governor
Connelly did not survive this Iowa and New Hampshire winnowing
process.  So basically what Iowa and New Hampshire do is not so
much to give us the nominee but kind of tell us who has been culled
from the pack.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Well, Bob, as you and I are sitting here talking, people 
are actually voting in New Hampshire. So when the people are watching 
this <i>Straight Talk</i> episode, already the results will be known. What 
would you tell those people who are already aware of what happened?  How 
could they interpret the events?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Well, just basically don't lose heart,
be engaged, make your wishes known.  If you are happy with the
outcome, stay with it.  Encourage other people.  We have had too
much disaffection and cynicism in our political system.  It is
not an ideal system, but as Winston Churchill said, democracy
is the worst system except for all others that have been tried.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being with us on <i>Straight
Talk</i>.
<p>
MR. MORRISON: My pleasure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> delves 
into why parents' rights to make and influence key decisions in their 
children's lives are slowly diminishing. Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am now joined by Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal Policy 
for the Family Research Council.  Cathy's extensive research into
the parental rights issue has led her to some interesting court
cases currently being battled across the United States.  Also
joining me is Paul Webster, a legislative assistant to Congressman
Steve Largent of Oklahoma who introduced the Parental Rights and
Responsibilities Act of 1995.  Welcome, both of you, to the show.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Cathy, you have been tracking this issue for a while, and 
for others it might seem self-evident. Okay, we care about parents. We 
think they should be in charge of their families.  But what has brought us 
to the point where we are actually looking for legal outcomes?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, we are just recently seeing an increasing, I feel, 
arrogance on the part of government in protecting children from their 
parents. We have seen it at the U.N., in the rights of the child, and
now we have seen it increasingly in our country.  The most evident
examples are the condom distribution programs, where condoms are
given to children as young as 11 or 12 years old, even over their
parents' objections.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And even in New York, the New York state court ruled that 
the parents could have no say.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  Well, New York, we were lucky in New York two years
ago.  New York said, no, this does violate parental rights, but
just last month the Massachusetts Supreme Court case saying parents
have no rights in this regard, children will be given these condoms,
even if parents object, was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court.
So now we have a terrible situation in Massachusetts where parents'
rights were simply dismissed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So having conflicting cases, Massachusetts and New York, does 
that drive it towards the Supreme Court, do you think?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Perhaps eventually. That's what we thought would drive it to 
the court this time, but they said no.  I am sure there will be other cases, 
and we will be working on cases to take it up to the court to resolve
this, because there is precedent at the court.  The court has
said that parents have this right and that the right shouldn't
be infringed.  So it's not anything new that we are searching
here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Paul, wasn't the condom distribution kinds
of cases that perked your attention and Congressman Largent's
attention, or were there other things that made you think we need
to get involved legislatively?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Well, what our interest was was a desire to support and protect 
America's families.  Congressman Largent came to Washington with really an 
agenda that was two-fold: one of them which focused on fiscal matters, 
balancing the federal budget; the other one specifically was to support and 
garner some kind of governmental, I guess, inactivity or limits on the 
government to the kinds of things that are going on that many families across
our country feel are threatening or infringing their ability to
just live the way that they live, live the way that they were
brought up, those types of interests.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Give us an example, you know, some issues that you all were 
looking at and saying I think the line is getting a little fuzzy here, and 
it shouldn't be.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Well, I think it's very clear.  I was asked a question, 
&quot;well, I have kids, and are you telling me that all these government 
interests are trying to break down my door and do terrible things between 
my children and I?&quot; My response is I don't think that anybody is 
proactively targeting your family to go after and make some kind of mischief.
<p>
What we hear in our office are families that are going about their 
business attempting to raise their children the way that they raised or
the way that they think that their conscience dictates and finding
that just in the normal course of day-to-day activities, either
through a school or through some other government agency, that
they are now prohibited from just confronting their educators
and saying, hey, listen, I take great pains to instill in my children
things that we believe in and values that are important to us,
and we would really appreciate it if you didn't contradict us
through whatever means that you are doing so now.  And those kinds
of reasonable actions are the kinds of actions that many times
across the country have been halted and really given families
very little recourse in terms of what they can expect and what
kind of support they can expect from the government.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it has been particularly sensitive on issues like sex 
education, condom distribution, and the discussion of values that might 
come up in, say, outcome-based education, where we are going to define
diversity as a value and then maybe bring in issues regarding
homosexuality that might have a different moral perspective than
parents.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  The school is very often the setting for
these kinds of violations of parental rights.  Psychological counseling
that parents don't want given to their children but that is given,
regardless of the objection, that is another big area, but even
outside the school, child protective services sometimes have come
into the home -- in fact, I shouldn't say sometimes, more often
that we would like -- come into the home and removed children
on mere rumor or on things as benign as spanking of a child. 
Now that doesn't happen every day, but it's happening with increasing
frequency, and that is sounding an alarm for parents.  You know,
we should be able to discipline our children with reasonable corporal
punishment, for instance.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.  You know, I think one thing a lot of people aren't 
aware of is that the Children's Defense Fund, a very liberal so-called 
pro-child group, formerly headed by Hillary Clinton, has advocated that no 
child be allowed to come home from the hospital until a social worker has 
been there first.  What other big picture, you know, big picture new
world order kind of intrusions do you see proposed by people?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, the children divorcing their parents.  There's
another key example, I think maybe derived from the same group.
We have a case out of Washington State that people have looked
at for some years and have been frustrated about where parents
were trying to protect their child from drugs and from sleeping
from her boyfriend.  This is a minor child, and that child wanted
to file for divorce, and social service agencies came in and said,
no, you child, your rights are being trampled on by your parents.
So we are going to protect you from your parents.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I know, Cathy, you've taken a look at the U.N. convention, 
and one of the concerns of people who want to strengthen parental
rights is that talks about the child's free right of association,
maybe to associate with drug dealers or to associate with people
who they are concerned about.  I think everyone appreciates in
their own life their parents saying that person you cannot hang
out with any more.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Beyond even that is the uninhibited right to receive any 
information or any speech or material that the child wants, including 
specifically pornography.  It's ridiculous. I mean, the U.N. is so far 
out of touch, but the scary thing is that U.N. principles are being forced 
upon our country against, I believe, our citizens' will.  President Clinton 
in 1994 signed the U.N. treaty on the convention on the rights of the 
child. It needs to be ratified now, and we are urging the Congress not
to ratify this for that reason alone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  I think there are really two dominant perspectives on
this whole issue.  One of them is very child-centric, that is,
whatever it takes to enhance and maintain the welfare of the child,
and the other one is a, in my perspective, much more common sense
approach, and that is our country was founded on freedom.  It
was founded on the right to be peculiar, if you will, antiquated,
progressive.
<p>
We have a society that is a free society and whose government was 
established to maintain that freedom, regardless of how it manifests 
itself, and so we are seeing the notion, the concept of freedom being 
held hostage by this idea that we have to protect specific and certain 
segments of our population no matter the cost, even if it costs us our 
freedom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Paul, what is the status of the legislation right now?  Where
is it?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  Well, we are very happy to see a Senate companion
to our House bill.  That is S-984.  The House bill is HR-1946,
and both chambers, the Senate and the House, have conducted subcommittee
hearings where witnesses have testified on behalf or in opposition
to the concept of the right of parents to direct the upbringing
of their children.
<p>
Right now we are working with organizations, the Family Research Council 
and other organizations, to get exact precise types of language that 
allows the courts very little wiggle room in terms of how to interpret 
the rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children.  We have 
128 co-sponsors on the House side.  So we are very excited about that, and 
we are looking forward to a subcommittee market scheduled where they'll
entertain amendments or changes to the bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Great. We are going to want to hear more about that after the 
break, and Cathy, thank you so much for being with us.  I would certainly
encourage anyone to call the Family Research Council for some
of Cathy's excellent materials.  Please join us after the commercial
break as we continue to discuss the rights of parents as we are
joined by those who are on the forefront of this issue.  Stay
tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Segment from Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act Press Conference 
follows:]
<p>
MR. LARGENT: Currently there is an imbalance between who makes the decisions 
in the home between parents and the government as you can see represented here 
on our balance.  Parental rights.  I think this is a graphic representation
of what we're talking about.  American families in the balance.
<p>
Currently, parental rights, even though they have been recognized
as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court, by lower court decisions
time and time again all across the country, the lower courts do
not recognize parental rights as a fundamental right.  What we
do with the parental rights bill is codify into law a federal
statute that parental rights are a fundamental right and should
thereby have the same protection as any other fundamental right.
<p>
Today, because of the imbalance or misinterpretation of Supreme
Court ruling, parents must demonstrate that the government has
acted unreasonably in order to prevail.  Government must demonstrate
that it simply has acted in a reasonable fashion in order to prevail
in court cases where their parental rights have been usurped.
<p>
There are four specific areas that we address in the Parental
Rights and Responsibility Act.  That is the right of parents to
direct the upbringing of their children in regards to their education,
their religious training, their medical care, and the discipline
of their own children.
<p>
We'll go to the last chart, and then I'll introduce Greg Erken with Of The 
People. This is what we want to see as a balance between government and 
family in terms of who directs the upbringing of our children.  After the 
Parental Rights bill is passed, we will find a situation where parents
must demonstrate first that the case is about a parental right,
again, one of those four areas that I addressed, and that the
government has intervened in their parental rights.  This is the
four-step process that we are putting in place with the parental
rights bill.
<p>
Then the last two steps, the onus is really on the
government to show that there was a compelling governmental interest,
not a reasonable cause or a reasonable interest, but a compelling
governmental interest existed and it used the least restrictive
means.  This test is applied to all fundamental rights protected
by the Constitution.
<p>
We are not erecting a new test here. We are simply saying that what the 
Supreme Court has decided over the last 70 years in terms of parental 
rights being a fundamental right, that this is the standard that should be 
applied and is the accurate standard that the Supreme Court has already 
decided, and we are simply placing that in federal statute.  So that is
the heartbeat, the guts, of the Parental Rights and Responsibility
Act. That is what we are trying to do.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: I'm Executive Director of Of The People, which is a coalition 
of parents, state legislators, and grass roots activists working at the state 
level to add a parental rights amendment to state constitutions.  Our
efforts at the state level are working in tandem with the federal
efforts here represented by this legislation to guarantee the
rights of parents.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  We find it confusing and alarming that so much of government 
today seems determined to relieve of us of our parental responsibilities 
and rights, especially concerning education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you can see, it seems the parental rights battle has 
begun at the federal level.  I am joined again by a key player, Paul 
Webster, legislative assistant to Congressman Steve Largent. Also 
joining us is Greg Erken, Of The People's executive director, and 
Rebecca Bocchino, a parent who became fed up with her children's education 
and began to research why her fight to change things seemed so hopeless. 
<p>
Thank you for being with us.  Greg, your group has been working at the grass 
roots level to get behind this piece of legislation.  How is that working,
and why did you get involved?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, Of The People has been working for about two years now, as 
you say, at the state level working to add a parental rights amendment to 
state constitutions, and we are also working with Paul and Congressman Steve 
Largent's, who is Of The People's national vice-chairman, in support of the
federal statute.
<p>
Just as some of your other guests have said and
will say, we got into the fight because it seems in so many areas
parents across the country are running into what we call a we
know what's best mentality for your children, whether it's condom
distribution or the resistance to school choice and vouchers,
psychological counseling or the threats to the rights of homeschoolers,
I would connect the dots and say that there is an overall assault
against parental rights and responsibilities, and we need to directly
counteract that at the federal and state level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, it's interesting that you have the right to make 
decisions for your parents unless it's different from a judge or a social
worker, it would appear.  I mean, your rights go as far as their
judgment would take you.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Yes, that's right.  I think what parents are facing now is 
occasionally they are allowed by our kind bureaucratic elites to actually 
oversee their children and their children's decisions once they leave the 
house, but we need to reverse that decision, that attitude, and we need to
make sure that parents in the vast majority of cases are in charge,
and it's the schools and other bureaucratic shops that should
ask the parents can we teach your children this, and how about
this?  Would that be okay if your child was in such-and-such a
class?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Exactly. Rebecca, you are a parent.  I know
that there were some parents that led you to say, you know, this
has been frustrating.  I need to make some changes.  What happened
in your own family situation?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Well, we thought we had moved to one of the best school 
districts in the nation. Fairfax County, Virginia is one of the largest 
school districts in the nation, and we thought we were coming to a place 
where our kids would get the best education that they possibly could,
only to find that most of the decisions were made by the school,
and we found the process of involving parents was so manipulative
that parental input actually was changed to parental reaction,
and I noticed my kids were coming home with more and more intrusive
questions, more intrusive curriculum.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Give us an example.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Guidance counseling, use of journals, sex education. I 
mean, Fairfax County is full of it, and the more questions that I asked, 
the more I was treated like the enemy and the more hostile reaction I got. 
<p>
The guidance counseling manual in Fairfax County goes into great detail in 
instructing counselors how they can stiff-arm parents from getting 
information about what their children are being counseled on, even though 
the manual admits that parents have the right to know, and two parents in
Fairfax County asked through a FOI request, a Freedom of Information
request, to know what was done with their children, and they were
told that it would cost them $600 to find that information out,
and that is unbelievable.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And that is already taxpayer funded. I mean, they are paying 
for the education the children were receiving.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Sure.  And parents found their kids were being exposed 
to psychotherapeutic techniques. Two programs that have received the 
most criticism nationally, Pumsy[?] and DUSO, were both on the approved 
materials list in Fairfax County.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, so people understand, these are sort of dream fantasy 
projection kind of things.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Give them a little detail on what Pumsy, for example,
would do.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Pumsy used guided imagery.  One of the
exercises involved tying up the teacher and blindfolding the teacher
in the middle of the classroom.  These exercises were designed
to teach students that they could retreat into their own mind,
into their own world, that they were the sole authority.  All
information could be obtained within.  Parents found their children
were taking psychotropic trips in the back of the family station
wagon, just self-induced hypnosis whenever they felt like it.
Even though counselors denied that they were using these techniques,
they lobbied hard in the general assembly not to ban the use of
psychotherapeutic techniques in the schools.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing. What are you seeing, Greg?  What other kinds of 
stories? I mean, the majority of the stories seem to come from the schools, 
where taxpayer money is presumably helping our children, but they are
not going to tell us what they are doing to help.  What else are
you seeing?
<p>
MR. ERKEN: Well, I think one of the classic kinds of cases that we see 
nowadays is condom distribution in the public schools, and parents are 
opposing not just the condom distribution, per se, but the fact that 
they are being handed out to their minor children over and against their 
consent, and there have been a couple of legal developments in the past 
couple of years that point out the need, why we need additional legislation 
for parents.
<p>
Parents in New York City a couple of years ago successfully sued
to get an opt-out in New York City for condoms.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now an opt-out, you have to explain that.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: Sure. A parental opt-out is a provision whereby a parent 
doesn't have the ability to stop the distribution period in the schools 
but does have a mechanism to make sure that their child either, say,
does not receive a condom or at least the parent is notified before
their child receives a condom from the school nurse or whatever
the mechanism is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  While an opt-in program would be parents saying, yes, 
please give my children condoms; here's my written consent, like the same 
thing a parent would do to go on a class trip.  Yes, my child can go, rather 
than my child only can't go if I say no.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  That's right.  In a lot of ways an opt-in is preferable, because, 
after all, aren't we trying to get parents more involved with their child's 
upbringing and in the public schools.  Shouldn't we kind of fight the couch 
potato mentality that allows parents, after all, just like the rest of
us with human nature -- it's too easy to go on autopilot and to
say someone else will make the decisions for my children.  Let's
have parents make those decisions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Paul, you're on Capitol Hill.  What has been the response to 
congressmen and senators when you come with these kinds of horror stories. 
I mean, are they interested in the fact that parents like Rebecca
are being told it's none of your business what happens with your
money or your children?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Their response is really surprising.  The first response is 
are you serious? Are you telling me that some parent in Georgia has to fight 
in order to not allow the school to take their daughters to a county health 
facility without their knowledge or without their consent?  They say are
you serious that kids in Massachusetts were exposed to blatantly
offensive and sexually explicit materials in the school assembly?
Are you serious that tests are asking things like are there handguns
in your house; are your parents on welfare?  You know, when was
the last time you masturbated?
<p>
They can't believe that this is the state of the relationship between their 
community government and their schools, which for the most part has the 
greatest government access to children and parents.
<p>
The other thing that is hard to believe that I like to point out to legislators 
on Capitol Hill is why is that so many of these state and local governments are
so willing to go to the mat for some of these things that seem
so silly and so peripheral to the education process when national
statistics are replete with examples of illiteracy, inability
to fill out job applications, remedial education in college of
basic mathematics.  I mean, it just seems to be a prioritization
that does not reflect the wishes and the needs of American families.
<p>
So really the biggest reaction is I can't believe that we need
this, and when we do explain to them, they say, wow, that sounds
like very commonsensical legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It's interesting the amount of attention paid to the sex lives 
of children rather than their reading ability.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Oh, it's amazing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk more about that in a moment.
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear more about the endangered
rights of parents.  You won't want to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. I'd like to welcome our guests back to the
show:  Paul Webster, legislative assistant to Congressman Steve
Largent; Greg Erken, Of The People's executive director; and Rebecca
Bocchino, whose life as a parent was affected by this key issue.
<p>
Rebecca, you were saying that in your discussions with parents
there are a lot of misconceptions about parental rights.  What
are you finding?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Some parents are making the mistake
that we need to ask the government to give us parental rights,
and that is wrong.  We have the right.  It is inherent.  It's
God-given, it's inalienable, and it is the proper function of
government to secure those rights.  Too many times we even see
Republicans talking about local control.
<p>
This whole opt-in opt-out issue, for example, in Virginia was tossed back 
to the local governments, and even some Republicans were plugging that as 
a good thing. I'd like for legislators and governors and mayors to understand
that parental rights is not subject to local negotiation.  It's
inalienable, it's inherent, it's our right, and it's the proper
functions of government to secure those rights.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And you were saying that sometimes government plays the race 
card in being against opt-ins, for example, which empower parents.
How do they do that?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  The Virginia Education Association and the NEA love to 
argue that because some families don't speak English or have other 
cultural barriers, they would not necessarily understand enough to 
make a decision to opt-in to a program. By their own logic, then, they 
also have to admit that they wouldn't understand enough to opt out, 
and if our long-range vision for education is truly lifelong learning, 
shouldn't we do all we can to lift parents up to the point where they can 
make an intelligent decision for their children?
<p>
I don't happen to agree with the statement that minority families are 
incapable of making decisions for their children.  I find minority families 
to be some of the most interested in their children's morals and values and 
education of all, and I disagree with the Virginia Education Association
and the NEA in that assumption, but we really should take a look
at opt-in as the preferred method of obtaining parental consent.
<p>
I mean, you couldn't walk into an emergency room and have a surgeon
go ahead and operate on your child unless you told them no, and
we shouldn't have it that way in the schools, either.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: As a matter of fact, the research would indicate that 
minority parents are even more conservative and concerned, and perhaps
the education establishment knows that, which is why they use
them to get out of asking.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Sure, absolutely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What's been your experience, Greg?  You are spearheading
this state by state.  What are you finding?  As parents go to
their legislators and say we want some action, how is that being
received, and what have you been doing?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, in state after state, the reaction is as Rebecca has 
described. Generally they are getting pretty much of a stiff arm, the 
parents, that is.  Paul touched on another interesting issue, which is as 
the parental rights movement grows, it is not going to be just the
kinds of parents who are concerned about the kinds of values that
are being taught, in sex ed and everything, but there is another
whole group -- and obviously there is a lot of overlap -- of parents
that are concerned just about academic standards.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Maybe not about the condoms, but when Johnny
comes home and he can't read or write, they want to get involved
with the public schools.  They are running into the same problem.
But help is on the way, because Of The People right now has launched
a number of efforts in states to put our simple amendment, which
says the right of parent to direct the upbringing and education
of their children shall not be infringed, into state constitutions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How many states are you in right now?
<p>
MR. ERKEN: We are active in 28 states, and we have a lot of interest in
the other ones.  We are going to ballot by a citizen initiative
in the state of Colorado.  It will be on the ballot there in November
1996, and I think we will also be very successful moving the amendment
by legislation in Michigan and perhaps Illinois and Alabama.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And certainly the research would indicate that when
one state embraces something like that, you get a real wildfire
starting.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  That's exactly what we are after.  We think
that the parental rights movement, because it is so potent, there
are so many parents like Rebecca out there who are fighting to
defend their families, this has the potential to become what we
call the term limits of the social values movement where we get
some victories at the state level, it spreads like wildfire, and
in turn that's going to help the efforts of Congressman Largent
at the federal level.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  And we've already seen state legislators begin to propose 
-- in Indiana the state house just passed a statutory parental rights bill 
that was -- it was not a state constitutional amendment, but Indiana, 
Alaska, Washington State, Kansas, I believe, there are a number of state 
statutory efforts that are going on.
<p>
I mean, it seems odd that we have to argue the point for something that 
is so common sense as to parents, you're good parents, you have the 
best interests of your children at heart, please, go about your business, 
we bless you and we support you, do your thing.  It's kind of funny.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In a country where an accused murderer is innocent until 
proven guilty and parents are held in suspicion, you know, almost guilty
until proven innocent.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  And it really does smack to the very foundations of what 
the United States is all about. Our constitution guarantees that we have 
certain civil liberties that are fundamental.  We have the liberty to 
speak. We have freedom of religion.  We have the liberty to believe. We 
have the liberty to exercise in the press, in the media.  The Supreme
Court has already said that -- 70 years ago was the last time
they iterated this -- that parents have the freedom to raise their
children free from governmental interference or intrusion.
<p>
So what we are really talking about and what underlies all the discussions
about today's social problems is the constitutionality of the
freedom for people to live as they choose, to live without overarching
governmental intrusion.
<p>
You know, the interesting thing back is if we look back 200 years at a 
different time in history, the people of this land revolted against a 
government that was too intrusive, that was too tyrannical, that stiff-armed 
their citizenry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Taxation without representation.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Exactly. Now we're having parenting without representation on 
the local and the state level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Greg, are you all concerned about legal challenges, 
constitutional legal challenges, and how are you preparing for that?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, first of all, as Paul mentioned, we are codifying 
something that the Supreme Court said, as he mentioned, 70 years ago and 
which the court has never overturned.  What we are doing is bringing in 
out of some law clerk's file that nobody sees and you parents have to hope 
that judges will remember these cases and apply them correctly.  We
are exercising the right of the people, hence our name, to move
parental rights sort of out of the ether from some of those rights
that everybody instinctively knows they have and putting it in
black and white.
<p>
That's something that the people always have a right to do, and the 
U.S. Constitution and the state constitutions always speak of enumerated 
and unenumerated rights, and all we are doing is moving this one from 
the back burner, because it's being forgotten by too many bureaucrats 
and judges and saying, hey, we want it in black and white now.  The time 
is right to add it up there with free speech and freedom of religion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Rebecca, is this conversation giving you more hope or
more fear?  You know, do you see any light at the end of the tunnel?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Oh, definitely more hope.  I mean, this Congress
is finally -- for the first time, I feel like we have a chance
to really do what parents have been trying for for a long time.
I don't know about you, but I don't want the village raising
my child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's right.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: And it's the socialist mindset that says if you're against 
government providing the service, you're somehow against the service being 
provided at all.  I want to be free to do what I can do for my children
and provide for them what I can provide.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you know what's interesting about that it takes a village 
comment is that in context -- and we're talking about Hillary Clinton's
book, <i>It Takes a Village</i>, where she argues that we need more 
government to raise successful kids -- the African proverb comes from the
context that when the families break down or the men leave the
family or they've gone off to war and been killed, it takes a
village to make up for broken families, not it takes a village.
Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  And it would be one thing -- again, you
could take that slogan, and in proper context it would be okay.
For example, if the village were not undermining what the parents
are teaching their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: The problem is when your child leaves home, they might 
encounter something in the movies or in the pop culture, which has 
gotten a lot of attention, which undermines parental authority.  What
we need to do is shine the light on too often it's our own government,
through our tax dollars, in the schools, that are doing some more
of that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. The village is on the attack. We've got a couple 
seconds left.  What's one last thing you'd like people to understand 
about this issue, very quickly?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: They need to get involved.  You know, the price for
freedom is eternal vigilance, and parents are going to have to
quit the country clubs and the golf games and get into the PTAs,
get on the school boards.  They are going to have to take a more
active role in their children's lives and in their education than
they're doing now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much for being with us. When we return, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a bit of Gary Bauer's appearance on 
CNN's Morning News, discussing another hot issue, welfare reform. 
Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Gary Bauer makes many appearances throughout the year on a 
variety of news broadcasts.  Gary is often seen giving his insight, 
particularly on CNN.  So let's take a look at what Gary had to say on 
CNN's Morning News regarding an issue most definitely discussed in the
upcoming election debates, welfare reform. <i>Straight Talk</i> now
brings you some Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[Segment from CNN Morning News follows:]
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Is there a quandary here for conservatives as to how much you 
soften on this provision?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Apparently some of my friends think there's a quandary.
I don't think there is.  I believe that anything that encourages
promiscuity and discourages marriage results in more abortion
and more illegitimacy.  That's what we've got now.  We've got
1.5 million abortions a year and one-third of our children being
born out of wedlock.  That's a disaster for this country.  Part
of the problem is welfare, and we need to reform it.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Well, but you see that there's a movement, it would seem, 
within the House and among the Republicans to soften the provisions.
How much would be acceptable to you?  Can you go with vouchers?
Can you go with some form of if not cash payment, provisions
to these unwed mothers?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I tend to be sympathetic towards vouchers in all sorts of 
areas, education, welfare, and so forth, but I hope the Republicans 
don't lose their heart on this, because I think the Catholic bishops 
are sounding the wrong note in their opposition.  To follow their argument 
through, we ought to increase welfare benefits.  Let's increase them 
ten-fold, because that will get abortions down.  Nobody believes that. 
In fact, the welfare system is encouraging abortion and encouraging 
illegitimacy by discouraging marriage.  That's what we need to get at.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Do you think the Catholic bishops are just seizing on the 
abortion issue to stake out more of a claim for the liberal position on
welfare?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I don't want to get too esoteric here,
but I think that in the bureaucracy among the Catholic bishops
there's a lot of support for the traditional welfare system that
has been put in place over the last 30 years, a system that takes
money out of the pockets of the American taxpayer and uses it
to subsidize bad decisions, and I hope that the Republicans put
a stop to that.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Is there any legitimacy, if you will, to the argument that 
this will lead to more abortions, any data to prove that?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I have a 20-year record of being a pro-life supporter. I 
don't think anybody doubts that if I thought there would be even one 
more abortion, I wouldn't support this.  I believe that the welfare reform 
will result in less abortion. In fact, the states with the highest welfare 
payments are the states with the highest abortion rates.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with us 
to hear how you can get more information regarding the issues affecting you 
and your family.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. If you'd like to receive more information 
about our organization, tonight's guests, or the topics discussed, call us at 
1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week, we will be discussing how the media influences society
today.  From television to movies to music to the Internet, we
are surrounded by the media and its control over what we see,
hear, and sometimes the opinions and decisions we make.  Does
the media take such a responsibility seriously?  We'll find out
next time on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
takes a look at something that hits close to home, especially for us here, 
the media's influence on today's culture.
<p>
Although the entertainment world's original mission was to bring wholesome 
programming and unbiased news coverage to the public, we have strayed far 
from that intention, it seems. An example can be seen in a recent 
controversy.  Just last week on ABC's <i>Nightline</i>, a report was given 
that insinuated American Catholics in the 1940s and 1950s, as a general 
rule, were prejudiced against Jewish Americans.  And although prejudice 
exists and is a terrible thing, should broadcasters slant a newscast with 
a negative portrayal of Catholics as a whole?  Is it fair to draw
conclusions of the views of all people in a certain group?  We'll
take a look at issues such as this and others in tonight's show.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from Bill Mattox, FRC's Vice President
for Policy.  Bill's extensive research of marriage and divorce
provides some key insights into why those who pledge to spend
their lives together in marriage often find themselves with broken
hearts and broken homes.  Bill's expertise on this subject has
been published nationwide, and <i>Straight Talk</i> would like to share
some of his findings with you as we go behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bill, thank you so much for being with us today on Behind the 
Headlines. As you know, tomorrow is Leap Year Day, and there is an 
interesting old Sadie Hawkins tradition from European history in 
Scotland beginning in 1280, and into England and beyond, that says 
that on that day, women were allowed to ask men to marry them, and
if the man said no, he might have to pay a sum of money or buy
her a silk dress.  What do you think about that old custom?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, I suspect there are a lot of young women today
who would like to see that tradition carried on and would seize
the opportunity that this day might provide to approach their
boyfriend and see if he might have serious intentions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Marriage is a fascinating topic.  Every women's magazine 
talks about it in great detail.  For Generation X-ers, it is 
particularly sensitive.  They have experienced a lot of divorce and 
marriage issues.  How is the pendulum swinging for them?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, you're right.  They very much look at this issue very 
differently, I think, than many previous generations, and I think a lot 
of that is because their experiences as children have been quite
different.  Many of them, as you know, have grown up in homes
that either never had a father to begin with because they were
born out of wedlock or, more often, where the marriage broke apart;
and many of them have seen, then, first hand the problems associated
with divorce, both what it does to adults as well as the pain
that it often causes children.
<p>
I think, for that reason, many young people today are quite wary of marriage. 
On the one hand, they don't want to go and repeat their parents' mistakes 
and very much want to avoid divorce.  In fact, in a lot of the polling
that we have done, we have seen that the concern about divorce
and opposition to easy divorce is greater among this age group
than it is among older groups.
<p>
But at the same time, because in many cases they have never seen a marriage 
succeed, they have never seen conflict resolved successfully, many of them 
are not prepared perhaps for successful marriage and, perhaps sensing
that, are quite often much more willing to go the route of, say,
cohabitation than previous generations.  We have seen here in
recent years that the rise in couples living together outside
of marriage has been quite profound, especially among younger
Americans, and I think it is a reflection, ironically, of their
concern about divorce and, in a perverse way, a reflection of
the -- at least in the case of some -- a reflection of their high
ideals about marriage and the fact that they very much want a
marriage to succeed.  Unfortunately, as you know, cohabitation
is not likely to increase the likelihood of a strong marriage;
in fact, it is more likely to hinder a successful marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Divorce is a very troubling subject to just about 
everybody, and in fact divorce reform today is a very big issue. People
are taking a look at how we might change the system.  How is divorce
reform being developed to bring more justice, in particular often
to women and children who are abandoned by men in search of trophy
wives?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, there are a lot of things being talked
about at the state level, and I frankly am quite encouraged by
the kind of growing dialogue and conversation and attention that
is being given to this subject.  In fact, speaking of leap year,
I just learned about a radio station down in Texas that, kind
of concerned about this issue, approached nine different judges
in the kind of three-county area where the radio station is heard
and asked them, on the 29th of February, a special day of the
year, that they not sign any divorce decrees on that day.  And,
lo and behold, all nine judges agreed to go along with that request.
They are calling it, I think, something like Home Improvement
'96 or something.
<p>
But we are seeing a growing level of interest and activism at the state 
and local level on this subject, and the policy proposals take a lot of 
different forms. The most common approach -- and, I think, perhaps the 
most appealing approach to this issue -- is one that is being advanced in 
the state of Michigan, where they are saying, look, on grounds of sheer 
justice, we want to protect spouses who do not want to see their marriages
dissolve, if they have done nothing that would, in a sense, fall
into the category of fault, so that if one spouse just wants to
get up one day and walk out, he or she is not able to do that;
that we are going to protect the interests of the spouse that
would not want for the marriage to dissolve.  Obviously, in cases
where both parties want to see the marriage dissolved, that would
still be possible.
<p>
But I think this has perhaps the greatest potential for movement in many 
of the states, because it really emphasizes this idea of justice and the fact 
that when someone abandons commitments that they have pledged to carry out, 
that has an effect, obviously, on the other spouse and also on children,
if children are involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  If you and I, Bill, were in a contract together and we were 
both going to bring something to the table and make a product, neither one 
of us could walk away without at least its costing some money to us, let 
alone perhaps being required by law to provide part of our contract.
<p>
In a fault-based system, my understanding is that there would
be some consequences for the person who walks away.  How will
a fault system be perhaps of assistance to women and children?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes. No-fault divorce is, I think, a misnomer.
There is no such thing as no-fault divorce.  I think, instead,
what we really have is, in a sense, no-consequence divorce, where
there are no apparent, at least no legal consequences, to someone
breaking a contract.  And yet we know that in other situations,
if that same man goes into the work place that same day after
he has abandoned his wife and children and decides to, say, fire
an employee or to break a contract with a vendor that does business
for his company, he is going to face certain legal rules that
he must abide by or face certain consequences.
<p>
What we have done with so-called no-fault divorce is really create 
no-consequence divorce.  And I think what we want to say is, look, if 
you make pledges, if you make commitments, if you make promises, we are
going to expect you to carry those out in the same way that we
do in other realms of life, and we are going to do this not just
for your good but to protect the interests of others who make
agreements with you based on their belief that you intend to follow
through.
<p>
Now, if for some reason the other party fails to live
up to their commitment, we will not hold you to remaining in the
marriage if you do not want to.  So if there is fault on the part
of the other party, yes, you can in those cases get a divorce.
But if, instead, you want to simply abandon your responsibilities,
you will not be permitted to do so and leave all the consequences,
if you will, to the other spouse.  We will protect their interests.
<p>
To take a look at the typical divorce, generally, the husband
is leaving a wife and child, often perhaps for a trophy wife,
and what we see, though, is that the thing that he most wants
is the ending of the marriage, and he gets that.  Then in divorce
what we see is a lot of negotiation for property and children,
and often the husband comes to the wife and says, &quot;Look,
you give me the property I want or I'm going to fight you for
the kids, and it is going to cost you a lot of money.&quot;  And
child custody battles become very bloody.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that going to a fault-based system will 
end these bloody wars over property but primarily for child custody?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: It may. I think it would be appropriate, whatever we do about 
fault-based divorce and whether we return to it in some way, shape, or form, 
I think it would be appropriate for us to try to disentangle these two
questions, because you are right.  It is quite common for one
spouse to kind of press on the property side while the other spouse
seeks to protect their interest in terms of child custody, and
that one quite often gets the kids and very little else.
<p>
I think it would be appropriate for us to separate these two issues and
to, first and foremost, in cases where the marriage is irretrievable,
say we want to protect the interests of the child and to make
a decision about how that child should be cared for and in whose
custody that child should be placed before we then proceed to
other questions about the division of property.
<p>
If that sort of situation were in play, then I think what we would see is 
that the decisions about who gets custody of the children would be
carried out in a way that is much better for all parties concerned,
and it would be done in a way that, of course, then would not
have implications for whether or not the parties are treated fairly
when it comes to property division.
<p>
But my hope is that we can avoid these kinds of questions as much as possible, 
and one of the things again that I find encouraging about a lot of the 
discussion that is beginning to take place is there is a growing recognition
that we have a very serious divorce problem in this country, and
my hope is that we can do as much as possible to prevent divorce
so that we don't have to then deal with a lot of these thorny
issues that arise in the course of divorce or, for that matter,
many years after a divorce.
<p>
You know, the bottom line here is commitment.  If there is a commitment to 
making things work, that goes an awfully long way toward making some of 
these difficult things all of a sudden seem less daunting and more 
overcomable.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And, of course, Family Research Council has a lot
of information and resources available.  We would welcome anyone
to call.
<p>
Thank you, Bill, so much for being with us.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
looks at a few ways that the media shapes our culture today
and whether or not industry leaders are taking that responsibility
seriously.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In today's world, it is virtually impossible to escape the 
media -- from newspapers to radio to television to cable networks, to 
satellites, to movies, to computers, and the list goes on.  We are 
surrounded by it and experience its influence daily.
<p>
As the media has blanketed our nation and culture, it has expanded not 
just in scope but in the way in which information is exchanged.  The 
growth in types of communication forms has been especially fast paced in 
the last 40 years; and, bombarded by so many messages and message forms,
the definition of normal has evolved.
<p>
[<i>Roseanne</i> segment follows:]
<p>
TEENAGE GIRL: That it's time for me to get some birth control.
<p>
[End of segment.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A few cases point:  the media's depiction of the typical 
family, whom it glorifies as heroes, and what is considered acceptable 
behavior.
<p>
So as we flip through the channels, we are forced to ask ourselves 
whether media positively or negatively affects our culture today. 
<p>
To help us distinguish between some of the negative and positive effects 
of media, I am joined by Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for 
the Family Research Council. As a former <i>L.A. Times</i> writer and 
editor, Bob has first-hand knowledge of how the news media works.
<p>
Also joining me, Tom Fitton, Director of Development for Accuracy in
Media, a media watchdog organization; and Sandy Crawford, director
of the Entertainment Division for the Media Research Center.
<p>
Welcome to this show, its distinguished guests which people need to 
know. I am surrounded.  Frankly, we started the show talking a little
bit about ABC's <i>Nightline</i> in the head.  ABC's <i>Nightline</i> 
show actually came out and said, well, we know -- and how do we know 
this? -- that Catholics almost all in general, in the 1940s and 1950s,
didn't like Jews.  Therefore, Pat Buchanan, being Catholic, must
not like Jews, either.  And now you tell me that, Tom, they have
decided to apologize.  Does this surprise you?
<p>
MR. FITTON: That's right.  They implied that Patrick Buchanan's father 
listened to Father Coglin(?), who was an anti-Semitic radio priest, talk 
show host, back in the 1930s and 1940s.  Ted Koppel came out and said,
&quot;Well, even though it was in the <i>Washington Post</i> and 
reported elsewhere, we should have checked it out ourselves,&quot; and
it turns out he didn't listen to Father Coglin, and there is this
unspoken assumption, or spoken assumption, that conservative Catholics
from the 1950s and 1940s were necessarily anti-Semitic.
<p>
Ted Koppel had to apologize on air to the Buchanan family, and that is 
a big deal in network news, to have a personal apology like that,
which shows just how far they went overboard in slurring the family.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Perhaps how much they were concerned about lawsuit,
as well.
<p>
Sandy, what have you seen in your work -- I know you
look at the entertainment medium, in particular -- about other
kinds of stereotypes that are being forced on people about all
these people are like this or like that?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: We are seeing a lot of negatives, especially where Catholicism 
is involved. That attitude is something that comes into play with 
entertainment media.  Many times you will see priests who are pedophiles, 
you will see nuns who are habitual child abusers, always whacking
children around with rulers and that kind of thing.  So you will
see that kind of stereotype, especially addressing people who
are religious or addressing people who are politically conservative.
Many times the folks who are politically conservative tend to
be portrayed as being somewhat backward and old-fashioned and
fuddy-duds; we don't want to be like that, that kind of mentality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. I actually was on a CNN program just last
week where they made the passing slur that, well, you know that
a lot of Buchanan women supporters have never been to college.
I had to say, &quot;Well, I don't assume that that makes them
idiots, and I don't assume that that is true, either.&quot;  You
know, I am offended on both counts.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, something we have noticed, too, is that Jay Leno has 
been particularly very, very harsh about Buchanan, and every night with 
the monologues -- I mean, we can look at these monologues and understand 
that a joke's a joke, and we can all laugh at that.  But some of these
so-called jokes have started to become very, very harsh, just
very unfair assassination attempts on Buchanan, referring to him
as being a member of the Klan and just really terrible stuff.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: As if that is funny.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FITTON: You know, the instinctive thing to call a conservative a 
Nazi, even in a joking manner, and to do it constantly night after 
night certainly doesn't help the conservative cause any, and it 
shows maybe that their instincts are wrong on this issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, you were actually in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 
newsroom and have had a distinguished career in journalism before 
you came to this side of the fence, and I know you've got a book 
coming out soon which we want to hear about.  But what happens inside
some of the entertainment world and news world?  Are people making
these assumptions?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, the assumption is always there that if you are in 
journalism, you are a liberal, number one, and they have many ways of 
testing that.  It used to be the Ronald Reagan test, I called it, 
where a small group of people would gather in the newsroom, and then 
someone would bring up Reagan's name -- it used to Nixon's, then Reagan 
--  and there would be a general smirk, and so forth, and everybody 
would make sure everybody was smirking.  And if somebody didn't -- they 
just took it straight -- they would start boring in on that person,
and they would start extracting opinions from that person, and
that person would become a lightning rod quickly if that person
didn't tow to every liberal orthodoxy.  It was uncanny.
<p>
I can say many great things about the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and I 
think it is a fine paper, but I will say it is the most intellectually
stultifying place I have ever worked.  Even the liberals were
looking over their shoulders to make sure that the particular
brand of political correctness was absolutely correct.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is easy to see political correctness on an Oscar night 
or an Emmy night.  Everybody has to wear the red ribbon and say the
same kinds of things about the Earth and fur and vegetarianism
or whatever.  But some shows -- you all, in particular, look at
a lot of entertainment things; Tom, you had some to bring up --
some shows do go a little bit further in kind of pushing a world
view.  What have you seen in your observations?
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, we tend to focus a bit more on news, and the problem 
is the news is pretty good at usually pointing out problems. <i>Prime 
Time Live</i> on ABC a few weeks ago had a good segment talking about 
the ethics problems that children have, that many are stealing and 
cursing and doing all sorts of nasty things in ways they used not to do,
and they pointed out some advice that you could give parents to
have your child behave in a more appropriate manner in school
or at home.  And I don't know if it had to do with religion. 
Religion was mentioned once.  Children were asked, is there anything
you would give your life up for? and they went out of their way
to say, well, there was really nothing they would give their life
up for, although there was a sidebar comment, &quot;A few children
said their family and religion.&quot;  That was the only time
it was mentioned.  It was not used as a sort of model to make
children grow up right, and the parents were told basically to
have dinner with their children more often, nothing about church.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So that's the answer to our problems, is mealtimes.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: I think that is symptomatic, and Ben Stein pointed this 
out in his book, <i>The View from Sunset Boulevard</i>, back in 1980; 
that religion on television was not so much trash as it was omitted. 
You would see a priest or maybe a rabbi perform a wedding or a funeral 
and maybe listen to a confidentiality.  But that was it.  They were
never main characters.  They were always considered peripheral.
<p>
He said there's a reason for this.  Most of the people in Hollywood
are irreligious.  They are not merely lapsed Catholics or Jews;
either they are hostile toward religion or feel it has no value
in the modern world.  Stein cited various surveys that have been
backed up since then by Robert and Linda Lichter and Stanley Rothman
showing people in Hollywood are greatly irreligious.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I have been intrigued by the popularity of <i>ER</i> 
and <i>Chicago Hope</i> and a lot of doctor shows right now, and everyone's 
on their deathbed and nobody prays, which I find an intriguing phenomenon;
you know, week after week, everyone's dying and nobody thinks,
I wonder what happens next or even talks about it.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: That is an interesting observation.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Or it is a last resort, but never in the middle of something.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I have actually never seen it.  I must admit I am a big fan 
of both those shows.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
And I have never seen anyone pray, even at the moment of death.  They are 
hanging on for their last moment, and they want to have one last Big Mac or 
something, you know? It is an interesting last wish.
<p>
What are you finding, Sandy, in entertainment?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, for the past two years we have released every year a 
study of how religion is portrayed on television, and our findings were 
very much in keeping with Mr. Stein's findings, that religion really was 
a non-event on television, that you tended to find more families who were 
watching the Superbowl together than ever going to church, ever saying
a prayer or saying grace, that kind of thing.  So our research
results do back up those claims.
<p>
As far as this general overall politicking, we have found overall that a 
lot of the politics of prime time have toned down somewhat.  The focus has 
turned to values -- sexual, moral values, moral issues -- and I think
that is where the big debate is going to be, because we are talking
about things like homosexuality and teen sexuality, that kind
of thing, and you are seeing just so much more really sexy television
shows that are out there, and even at hours early in the evening
now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more about this.
Please join us after the commercial break as we continue to discuss
the media's cultural influence with those who are watching.  Stay
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined again by some experts who have investigated the 
media's influence on our culture and especially our children today:  Robert 
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council; Tom 
Fitton, Director of Development with Accuracy in Media; and Sandy 
Crawford, the Media Research Center's Director of Entertainment Division.
Thank you again for being with us.
<p>
Sandy, I wanted to go to you first because we all know that newsrooms are 
supposed to be apolitical, and I want to hear about how apolitical they 
really are.  But I was intrigued recently on again a <i>Chicago Hope</i> 
episode where they portrayed a partial-birth abortion scenario.  They
got it wrong.  According to the partial-birth abortion ban, if
your life was in danger, absolutely, it is a necessary procedure.
<p>
It is always -- you know, abortion is, after all, an ending of
something.  In this episode, the baby was dead, the woman was
going into cardiac arrest, and they removed the child and called
it a partial-birth abortion to save her life and then had a show
about this where both of these facts were wrong; and, coincidentally,
it was on the timing of the vote.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you see that kind of coincidence in entertainment?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Nothing is coincidental.  Putting something on prime-time 
television means never really having to check the facts. It's all gut.
In the producers' gut, if they knew this was right, then that
is all that counts.  Don't let the facts get in the way.  And
that is something that we find in many instances in dealing with
things like we were talking about where religion is concerned.
There is a mind-set in Hollywood where the folks just -- they
don't have the facts on some of this information.  They don't
do their homework to the extent that they should whenever they
enter the political arena.  Now, there are some folks who do do
their homework.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: But in many instances it is whatever is in that liberal gut. 
That is what is going to fly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It must be true.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: It must be true.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  And they're not going to get challenged a whole lot.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: No.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: That's the problem. They're in a little glass jar, all talking 
to each other, all saying the same thing.  As Pauleen Kale, the New Yorker 
film critic, said once, &quot;I can't believe Nixon won by a landslide. 
Nobody I know voted for him.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: They are so out of it sometimes; they don't get that 
corrective, just the questioning sometimes from another point of view.
<p>
MR. FITTON: And the question seems to be, what is the impact?  And
for a long time during the 1980s, there was this unspoken pact.
Bill Bennett and Nancy Reagan got the media companies not to
glorify drug use in their movies or in their programs.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, that has fallen by the wayside.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is sliding, yes.
<p>
MR. FITTON:  MTV is full of music videos glorifying the use of drugs. They 
have run documentary programs on MTV. CNN has run a documentary program 
with a pro-legalization bent, and this sort of stuff is coming out in the 
form of higher drug use among teenagers.  It does have a real-world impact, 
and to pretend that adults can somehow separate what is good and what
is bad -- well, we can't allow our children to be forced to make
decisions like that because often they need a little help, and
one of the ways that we can help them is by keeping some of this
bad stuff off, by encouraging the corporations to be more responsible
about it.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Even cigarettes are back as a prop, because
Hollywood had been sensitive about that.  Young people were being
led into smoking, so it wasn't so cool anymore.  But if you see
movies like <i>Get Shorty</i> with John Travolta, the cigarette is the
main prop.  He uses it much the way Humphrey Bogart used to. 
But back when Humphrey Bogart was smoking, we didn't have these
soaring cancer statistics.  So I think they are being absolutely
irresponsible in glorifying cigarette use.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are going to look in the next segment in particular at 
the issues of children with an expert with Missing and Exploited Children.
But in terms of the news media looking at children and the entertainment
media looking at children, one thing that we have noticed is some
assumptions:  that they are sexual, that they can make their own
choices, that they don't need adults.  Do you see these kinds
of assumptions being made by the news media?  You know, get those
parents out of the way of those enlightened children.
<p>
MR. FITTON: That is right. I mean, MTV, which reaches a lot of children,
whether parents like it or not, ran a series of programs called
<i>Sex in the Nineties</i>. What they would do was produce folks who
were engaging in sexual behavior that most parents wouldn't want
their children to engage in.  There was no moral -- it wasn't
called immoral. It wasn't called, Hey, maybe you ought not to
be doing that. They presented homosexual relationships the same
way they presented heterosexual relationships.  It was seamless.
They would talk to a homosexual about his or her relationship
and then they would jump and talk to a heterosexual, as if there
was no difference.
<p>
These sorts of things are being fit to our children through outlets 
that children watch.  They really have a hostility towards parental 
values in this area.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, and they always say it's always up to the parent to 
be there, to change the channel.  Any parent knows you can't be in front
of a television set all the times your children might.  A case
in point was the other day when I took my daughter somewhere but
we left our 12-year-old just for a few minutes, and we had to
tell him, &quot;Look, you can only watch this.&quot;
<p>
Well, everybody knows the human heart is just -- if you say no to 
something, the human heart wants to say yes.  If you line up 30 park 
benches and on the last one it says, &quot;Don't touch, wet paint,&quot;
that's the one they're going to touch.
<p>
So we're in a bind.  If we make a big deal out of telling our son don't 
turn on the MTV, that is undue pressure on him.  And yet if we say nothing, 
he may stumble upon it.
<p>
So don't tell me it is always up to the parent to do it. We've got to 
clean up the air waves.  They ought to be family-friendly, and every 
parent shouldn't feel you have to throw up a fortress around your house 
and children.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Sandy, you have a tool for that, and
I know Bob has used it.  Michael and I don't have children yet,
so we haven't had the need for it.  But tell us a little but about
the <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: We put out the <i>Family Guide</i> every year. It covers 
every single prime time television show on the four major networks and 
also Warner Brothers and UPN on the Warner Brothers and UPN networks. 
<p>
So what we try to do is give parents as much information about every
television show as possible.  We talk about things like what kinds
of values are on the show, if there is a lot of sex, if there
is a lot of rude language, just so each parent can make the call
themselves and apply what works for their family and make the
decision and get as much information as possible so that they
are making educated decisions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of values do you see being given to our children 
or assumptions made about our children on entertainment television?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, the major assumption that is being made about children 
is that they are ratings points; they are just rating points.  Moving
a show like <i>Friends</i>, NBC's <i>Friends</i> -- that is a 9:30 
television show if I have ever seen one, with some of the subject matter
that is on, and very risque, lots of sex, lots of very vulgar
language on that show -- moving it to 8 o'clock, the ratings went
up, and of course they went up, because there are more warm bodies
sitting in front of the television, regardless of what age those
warm bodies are.
<p>
So in many instances you have networks that are
looking at children as potential audience members, as extra points
that they can sell to potential advertisers.  So that is kind
of a sad commentary on how the networks feel.
<p>
The networks do see children as being sexual beings, that they should -- 
that their wants and needs and desires are on the moral equivalency
level of those of adults; that they should have the opportunity
to experiment sexually, that kind of thing.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Right, and therefore, they are not as sensitive to parents' 
wishes. They say, we can go to the kids directly, because if they're 
competent, after all, they can listen to the stuff as well as anybody 
else.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tom, what have you seen?  We are coming to the end
of our time.  When you go to -- and I would like each of you to
really fast respond to this -- if you look at an entertainment
industry or news company, and you say to them, &quot;Look, you're
being an irresponsible citizen of our national community,&quot;
what kind of response do you get?
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, you get a very hostile, defensive response, and just 
one person saying something isn't enough.  You need to write to the 
advertisers. We have confronted these folks at the stockholders' meetings. 
We have embarrassed them in public, and that is the only way these 
corporate types respond positively to these concerns.  You can't be nice
with them.  You need to say, &quot;You're going to lose money
if you engage in this sort of irresponsible programming.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you think, Sandy, when you tell them, &quot;You're
being an irresponsible entertainment producer&quot;?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, you've got to keep that two-way dialogue going. It 
is not enough just to walk away from the television, because when
you do that, you're saying that there's no hope for Hollywood
and that they're never going to change.
<p>
I really do believe there are a lot of good people in Hollywood who really 
do want to change. They need our encouragement and they need our support.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are going to get to hear more from Bob Knight after the 
break.
<p>
I would like to thank both of my guests and hope that people
will call us for more information about their excellent organizations.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear more about how the 
media has changed the portrayal of children and their behavior over
the years.  Is it hurting or helping them?  We'll find out after
this break.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're  back with more <i>Straight Talk</i> from the 
Family Research Council.
<p>
I would like to welcome Pete Banks to the show. Pete, a former police 
investigator and supervisor in the Child Abuse Unit is now the Director 
of Outreach at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
And joining us again is FRC's Bob Knight, who has researched the
sexualizing of our children.  Thanks so much for being here.
<p>
Pete, my introduction to your organization came years ago when I was
a reporter, and it was very impressive.  You all had a cataloguing
of materials that showed how children were being seen as sexual
objects and were working on trying to rein in that kind of problem.
<p>
What have you seen in terms of the sexualizing of children, and
what is your group trying to do about that?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, we are responsible mainly for the national child 
pornography tip line, and as such we assist the U.S. Department of 
Customs and the postal authorities in their investigation of child 
pornography.
<p>
You know, there is not a fine line.  The fact of the matter is, child 
pornography is against the law.  We are not talking about protected 
speech; we are not talking about free speech; we are not talking about 
First Amendment.  We are talking about victimizing children, not only 
when the pictures are taken but also when they are displayed, and if 
you understand that each time that child's picture is shown, they are 
being victimized again and again, and quite often that type of material 
is used to exploit other children, used as grooming tools for other 
children to say, &quot;Oh, you see, they are kind of happy, they are 
smiling; why don't you do the same thing?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Have you seen in our entertainment media, which started 
off with adults, and a lot of people are going to be the caretakers 
of children, to children really being sexual agents on their own, what 
impact have you seen from that sort of change in the media?
<p>
MR. BANKS:  Well, you know, one of the things that we always don't like 
to see is the childhood or the innocence taken from a small child, and 
that in itself is wrong, and that is wrong when they are victimized by 
a child molester or victimized by any of the institutions in society, 
whether it be the media or otherwise.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is a concern of your all's?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Oh, certainly it is, yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And what have you been telling the police and the parents 
that you work with about that shift?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, understand that children that are victimized, not only 
does it harm them, but they also have the potential for when they grow up 
to be victimizers themselves.  I think this is something that we have found 
to be true throughout the abuse of children and throughout the sexual
exploitation of children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, I know this has been a real concern of yours and that 
some of your interest in the media came because not only was the media 
sending certain messages, but it was sort of changing the culture in 
particular for children. What have been your observations about this 
shift?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Well, the media are emitting a constant drum beat, and it 
is geared toward children, and it is that you are the main actor
here; you make up your own mind.  Only a wimp child would go to
his or her parents.  You see it all the time, and sometimes the
media promote things merely by examining them.
<p>
Case in point: a cover story in <i>USA Weekend</i> just a couple of weeks 
ago. It showed a picture of hundreds of kids, and it said, &quot;Why 
More Kids are Turning on to Pot,&quot; or something like that.
<p>
I remember during the 1960s when I was growing up that my interest in 
drugs was piqued by Time magazine and other magazines constantly 
saying, &quot;Look, everybody's doing it.  Everybody's doing it.&quot;
I felt weird because I wasn't doing it.
<p>
I got a chill when my son picked up the Sunday paper, and the first thing 
he saw was this thing, and he's going, &quot;Wow!  What's all this 
about?&quot; It is to the point where I don't want a mainstream magazine 
to come into my house anymore, because they are aiming it right at
my kid.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, there was an interesting study
not so long ago that Judith Reisman did, Dr. Judith Reisman, taking
a look at even in <i>Playboy</i> magazine over the last, I think -- 
what was it, Bob, 30 years? or since the beginning of the magazine --
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- that, more and more, the cartoons portrayed child sex 
rather than even adult sex in this adult magazine.  Has that been a trend 
that you have observed?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, just recently I remember seeing an advertisement
for some professional skaters, and one of the skaters was wearing
an outfit to dress up like a little child acting risque and everything.
You know, kids are naturally inquisitive and naturally risk-taking,
and we certainly don't want to be giving them more and more ideas.
<p>
You know, this is one of the things that happens on the on-line
services on the Internet, where they are able to go in and to
be whoever it is they want to be, and they wind up getting over
their heads.  They wind up getting in trouble because they are
making decisions because they haven't had the opportunity to go
through life to make the good decisions.
<p>
This is one of the concerns that we have about Cyberville.  We don't 
call it cyberspace anymore; we call it Cyberville, with citizens and with 
places. And the only difference between Cyberville and everything else is 
Cyberville has no zoning regulations, and Cyberville has no FCC.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BANKS: So you can turn a corner and be anywhere.
At least there are some regulations, often effective, sometimes
not, that show what children see on commercial television, and
parents can make choices as to what they see on television.  But
in Cyberville, you have to be very careful about where your child
is roaming.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that the research indicates is that 
when it comes to sex acts in particular but in terms of children, 
child sex acts specifically, that we start with bringing down the 
barriers with visualization, like you said, showing alcohol, showing 
drugs, showing sex.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Grooming, it is called.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Grooming. And this is the kind of thing that, from MTV 
to, frankly, sitcoms, there is a lot of grooming going on out there, 
isn't there?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Yes, there is.  Yes, there is, unfortunately, that the 
taboos of yesterday are no longer in place, and I often wonder -- 
you know, when I retired from the police department, I kind of left
and I figured maybe we had two generations left in America before
we all killed each other, and I can remember so fondly that when
I was a kid, I mean, going to Mrs. Krischek's house with my little
bag on Halloween and getting a couple of potato pancakes and eating
them.  Can you imagine if your kid came home today with potato
pancakes?  You would throw everything out.
<p>
But by the same token, there were certain things that a child learned 
as they reached to adulthood when they are able to make the proper 
decisions, when they have had the exposure from the family.  But what 
we see now is kids without families.  What we see now is kids that
are growing up without any love, without any caring, without being
given any moral discipline by anyone.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: I mentioned earlier that the idea that the parent can be 
there and always monitor what the child is watching has fallen by the 
boards because of family dissolution.  Studies show many children watch 
hours of television and they are unsupervised.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Well, it is a national babysitter.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, it really is, and it babysits because the mother or the 
father can get something else done in the meantime.  They can't be there 
every second. So they do the best they can.  They hope to leave the child 
in the hands of someone who is not going to exploit them.  But you
can't be so sure these days.  There is so much on there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So where do we go from here?  There are tools like the 
Accuracy in Media and Media Research Center guides.  Frankly, Family 
Research Council has been interested in a P-chip, not a V-chip which 
would let the government or the entertainment media make some choices
for us, and if you buy technology, it blocks what we decide it
blocks; we have been in favor of a P-chip that a parent could
program in their own selection to block, depending on age appropriateness.
<p>
But what do you see out there?
<p>
MR. BANKS:  Well, you know, I wish we could program parents before they 
have children so that they can make good decisions, because it's a full-time 
job. We cannot put all of our eggs in the basket of technology.  We see 
that with the blocking mechanisms on some of the computers and everything
out there.  That is wrong.  Raising a kid is a full-time job,
and you need to make the right choices.  You need to ensure that
you elect officials that create the laws, that pass the laws,
that enforce the laws that protect your children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I was talking to a parent just before I came in 
here. Sorry, I want to get your opinion on this.  She said she bought
every blocking mechanism possible, put them on the entire computer,
and then got on there and saw what was happening in some of the
chat rooms and was horrified.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Right. It's a challenge to the kids, and again, those areas are 
the, quote, unquote, protected areas. They are the free-speech areas, and 
you have to be very, very careful.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it shows that you can't just depend
on shielding mechanisms.  Number one, your kid goes out there
and talks with all the other kids who haven't had a conscientious
parent shield them, so they pick it all up, anyway.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Right.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  The other thing is that why should the onus
be on the parents?  We've got to clean up the air waves.  This
is a little like that proposal by the President to bring back
school uniforms.  It may be a good idea for the wrong reason.
He said, &quot;Well, maybe now they won't get into fights over
expensive designer jackets.&quot;
<p>
So this is the typical liberal response. Instead of saying, &quot;Well, 
let's stop the crime,&quot; now make everybody wear uniforms.  So they say, 
&quot;Instead of stopping the trash that's coming out of the air waves, 
let's shackle all these parents to this new technological gizmo that's
supposed to help them.&quot;  It is avoiding the problem and treating
the symptom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to have you back, Bob, to talk about 
your book looking at the impact of the media.
<p>
We have a few moments left.  What would you like parents to understand
about the world in which their children are growing up?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, what they need to understand is that the ground rules 
have changed.  It is no longer the way it was when they were children.
And the other thing is that they don't want to put their child
into a place where they're going to lose their childhood or their
innocence.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And is that the computer world today?
<p>
MR. BANKS: That is <b>the</b> world.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A lot to think about. I would like to thank my guests very 
much.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a clip from Gary Bauer's 
appearance on CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>. We'll hear what Gary has to 
say about the media. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>.
<p>
Gary Bauer had the opportunity to express his opinion on 
today's media during a recent CNN <i>Inside Politics</i> show. Whose 
responsibility is it to monitor what happens in our entertainment 
industry? Let's hear what Gary Bauer has to say on Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[CNN segment from April 11, 1995, follows:]
<p>
MR. BAUER: The fact of the matter is that American culture is a lot different 
than it was 10, 20 years ago and that there is a constant diet of 
glorification of violence, of sex, of anti-women attitudes, of things that 
are debased and depressing that are served up particular to our children,
and I think a lot of Americans are offended by it.
<p>
Look, you have to be Rip Van Winkle and be asleep for the last 30 years 
to not realize there has been an incredible change in the nature of what
is shown on TV and in the movies as far as language is concerned
and vividness of the images, et cetera.
<p>
I think the point there is that, constitutionally, the folks in Hollywood, 
like Mr. Scher(?) and others, are able to do almost anything they want, 
and I don't think anybody would challenge that.  But there is also such a
thing as being good citizens.  And I think what Bob Dole's hopes
-- and I believe he spoke in his speech of the concept of shame
-- I think Bob Dole hopes that people in Hollywood would start
being good citizens and be partners with the rest of us in trying
to raise children and to send messages in our culture that are
positive and uplifting rather than constantly focusing on death
and destruction, violence, and hostility and violence against
women.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
confronts the drug problem in America and asks whether there is a problem 
at all.
<p>
The Clinton Administration significantly cut back the Office
on Drug Policy, saying it wasn't really a problem.  Many believe
we are actually winning the drug war.
<p>
Well, statistics on drug use show differently.  The number of drug 
abusers, especially among teens, has risen significantly in recent years. 
The National Institute on Drug Abuse found that annual marijuana use, for 
example, among eighth graders more than doubled, from 6.2 percent in 
1993 to 13 percent in 1994.
<p>
The steep rise in marijuana use also crosses over to hard drugs. Hospital 
emergency cocaine-related cases rose from 101,000 cases in 1991 to 120,000 
in 1992, and during the same period we had that problem with heroin. 
Heroin-related emergencies soared from 36,000 to 48,000 cases.
<p>
As this battle rages and more lives are lost, we must ask ourselves, 
what are we doing wrong?  Well, tonight we will talk to some people who
are working together to answer that question and battling for
solutions.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from the Family Research Council's
president, Gary Bauer.  Over the past years, we have heard a lot
from Amnesty International and other groups fighting for human
rights in Bosnia or China, for example.  But we rarely hear of
some other rights and lives that are being lost because of the
persecution of Christians throughout the world.
<p>
Gary recently has been studying this travesty, and in fact, FRC's Marty 
Dannenfelser recently spoke before a Senate committee to bring this 
persecution to light.
<p>
So let's hear what Gary has to say about a topic which has not seen much 
air time as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Recently, Gary, you attended a conference by the Freedom 
House that dealt with the issues of persecutions of people of faith
worldwide.  What did you learn there?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, this is a really scandalous situation.  We all know that 
militant Islam is on the march in a good bit of the world, certainly 
throughout the Middle East and in many countries in Africa.  Along with 
that militancy has come an increasing amount of Christian persecution.
<p>
At this day-long conference in Washington, we got reports from
countries like Iraq, Ethiopia, Pakistan, others, Saudi Arabia,
where the persecution of Christians has gone so far that in Ethiopia,
for example, they are actually crucifying again those citizens
that they can identify as being practicing Christians.
<p>
We obviously feel deeply about this problem, not only about the fact 
that such persecution is taking place, but we also feel outrage at the 
fact that our own government, the Clinton Administration, particularly,
has been very insensitive on this.  The State Department regularly
releases reports on these countries that basically whitewash the
human rights abuses.  The State Department has caved in a number
of times to pressure from these countries on religious matters.
<p>
And so we want to really highlight in the months ahead what is
happening around the globe in these countries, many of whom receive
taxpayer dollars through foreign aid, and we certainly want to
up the pressure on the President to get serious about this issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The events in Saudi Arabia were particularly interesting.
Ironically, the U.S. Government caved on issues relating to pornography
and a bar rather than dealing with the issues of people of faith.
Can you tell us about that?
<p>
MR. BAUER: That is really an incredible story.  Apparently, at the U.S. 
Embassy in Saudi Arabia, there was a tradition there of holding church 
services at the embassy for American citizens that would want to come by. 
There was a Catholic mass held and some other services.
<p>
The Saudi government demanded that those church services end and also 
demanded that the U.S. Embassy close an embassy-sponsored nightclub that 
American soldiers would frequent.  As you point out, the American 
Government, faced with these two demands, caved on the church services 
but insisted that the night club stay open.  I think it just shows
that when it comes to these kinds of issues, many in the State
Department really have a tin ear on these kinds of matters, and
that is particularly offensive to many American Christians.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that you talked about was that children
were being taken away from their families.  What did you learn
about that?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, it goes even beyond that.  There is widespread 
evidence of slavery again in many of these countries, only what is 
happening here is that Christian families are being broken up, and as 
part of this persecution, the children and the women are being taken away 
and literally sold into slavery in some African countries, again with almost 
no notice by the United Nations that usually is quick to point out human 
rights abuses, and certainly almost no attention being paid by the Clinton 
Administration on this issue.
<p>
We heard reports out of Iraq where Christians in Iraq that managed to 
escape that country into Turkey, they cannot get an interview with American 
State Department officials in Turkey. Instead, we insist that they be 
interviewed by the Turkish secret police.  The Turkish secret police are 
heavily influenced by radical Islam.  And so what happens is that these 
Christians that manage to get out of Iraq are sent back into that country to 
a fate that we can only guess.  At this point, the only thing we are 
exporting to Iraq are Christians, and that again is a tragedy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What would you recommend the U.S. Government to do about this?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, we need to be serious about human rights abuses
no matter who is involved, and certainly in these cases, which
is an area of growing abuse, we need to be very aggressive.
<p>
I think the State Department needs to start issuing regular reports
on this.  I think we need to make it clear that American foreign
aid will end unless religious persecution ends in these countries.
<p>
I would like to see the President appoint a special assistant
at the White House on this issue whose responsibility it would
be to brief him and the Congress on what it is we are picking
up through intelligence reports, and so forth.
<p>
And, last but not least, I certainly would like to see the Christian 
church arise from its sleepiness.  The church has really been behind 
the curve on this, and we quite frankly could take a page out of the book
of the Jewish community that has been very adept and very aggressive
any time a Jewish citizen anywhere in the world has been discriminated
against.  My hat goes off to the American Jewish community for
being aggressive on that kind of issue, and I think the American
Christian community needs to learn something from them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ironically, the person who is leading the fight for 
Christians being persecuted is a Jewish gentleman.  Isn't that a little 
odd to you, as well?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  That is right.  Michael Horowitz, whom I worked with in the 
Reagan Administration, has taken the lead on this issue and, quite 
frankly, has been frustrated because so many church organizations in the 
United States seem to show very little interest or seem to be fearful of 
actually confronting these countries who are engaging in this unacceptable 
persecution.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you see a parallel in the increase of persecution
of Christians worldwide and incredible support here in the United
States for a religious liberty or religious equality amendment?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think our founding fathers knew that persecution
is always just a day away, that liberties are very hard to maintain.
And I think that to the extent we turn a blind eye to persecution
in other countries, we set ourselves up eventually for not being
able to deal with persecution in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for being with us, Gary.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight
Talk</i> begins our discussion over ways to combat America's drug
problem.  As we look at stats, it is easy to see that we have
failed to win this tough fight.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Recently the Family Research Council hosted
a day-long seminar that brought together experts who have researched
and been personally involved in treating our Nation's drug problem.
Following the seminar, I had the opportunity to speak to some
of those experts.  In the upcoming discussion, you will meet Lt.
Col. Robert Maginnis, a policy expert now with the Family Research
Council, who has taken a look at some of the criminal efforts
involved in the drug arena; Dr. Sally Satel, a psychiatrist specializing
in clinical and policy areas of addiction medicine -- right now
she works with the District of Columbia's drug court -- and Bob
Peterson, a former drug czar from the state of Michigan and now
a leading consultant in the field.
<p>
Join me as we take a look at what these experts had to say.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for joining us all today.  Bob, one of 
the things that the Clinton Administration told us as they gave some major 
slashes to the drug budget was that we didn't have the problem anymore so 
much; that drug use was down.  Is that your finding?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Not at all, Kristi.  As all the national surveys are 
indicating now, drug use, especially among young children, and especially
in regard to marijuana, has skyrocketed in the last four years.
And, really, we need to lay the blame to a certain degree on
the parents.  The parents of the sixties, who were experimenting
with drugs in a big way, are now raising children, and they are
giving them sort of a mixed message.  There is a value conflict.
They want to say, &quot;Well, don't use them,&quot; but at the
same time, the kids are starting to use them, and it is really
devastating this country and we don't even know it.
<p>
If you start looking at what is going on in the media, they are 
glamorizing drugs.  You start looking at what this is costing this 
country in a major way, billions and billions of dollars, far more it
is costing us than in reality what it is costing us to try to
suppress it, to reduce demand, to reduce the supply of drugs in
this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sally, you are taking a look at people
who are in a court situation.  They have a drug problem.  Are
your numbers going down, or are you finding more and more people
coming to you for whom drugs are an element of the crime that
they are involved in?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Well, I think the data shows very well that heavy drug use is 
not going down at all, and the individuals I see are people who have been 
given a choice by a judge to either go to jail or go to a treatment program, 
and for many of them, even though they are well into their thirties, they
have never been in treatment before, though they have started
using drugs in their teens.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Are we seeing that it is possible for someone to have a 
minor marijuana use habit and that it ends right there?  You know, a lot 
of times people, when they talk about drugs, think that that there is an 
entry, a safe place where we can have recreational drug use.  Is that 
possible?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Well, marijuana is considered a gateway drug.  I think
that one of the reasons it is a gateway to heavier drug use, to
harder drug use, is because of the criminal element that individuals
become associated with as they are obtaining the drug.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, you have done a lot with the prosecution, and you 
were at the Department of Justice and have been on the prosecutorial 
side. In your experience, is drug use and the prosecution of drug use,
do they go hand in hand?
<p>
MR. PETERSON:  Well, the two are certainly correlated, and that is what 
is important for parents to realize, is that even if your child doesn't 
use drugs, if drugs are being used, your child is at risk.  For instance, 
date rape is highly correlated with alcohol and drug use; accidents, 
with marijuana. When they decriminalized in California, the number of 
accidents or charges for driving under the influence or reckless driving
went up.
<p>
A recent study showed that, out of those who are tested,
who test negative for alcohol, who are driving recklessly and
dangerously, the vast majority have illegal drugs in their systems.
So your children are at risk from crime and from accidents regardless
of whether they are using or not.
<p>
The other thing with marijuana is that the potency has gone up.  It used 
to be -- &quot;It's not your father's Oldsmobile,&quot; they say.  Well, 
it's not your father's marijuana.  It used to be 2 to 3 percent THC, 
which is the psychoactive compound in marijuana.  Now some of it is
2 to 3 percent, but they have gotten it up to 30 percent through
hybrid breeding.
<p>
The other problem is that methamphetamine is back, which is another very 
dangerous drug, because people who take it who are unstable are a lot more 
likely to act out when they are under the influence of these drugs.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Are you finding that, as you look nationwide, if there is an 
area of the country where drugs are not dealt with strictly and quickly
-- you know, what is the word, &quot;swift and sure&quot; -- that
that does have an increase in users?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Yes. I just actually did a book on this, and what I found 
was that from 1960 to 1980, the odds of going to prison or jail for drugs 
dropped dramatically.  It went down like 374 percent.  From 1980 to 
1990, it went back up again.  Well, from 1960 to 1980, violent crime
went up something like 250 percent; murder reached its peak level
in 1980, when drug incarceration was at its lowest level.
<p>
In fact, we have this myth that we are tough on drugs.  Under the
federal system, the average amount of marijuana is 3.5 tons that
a trafficker has.  And for possession of marijuana and cocaine
and crack under the federal system, you are less likely to go
to prison for that than you are for a tax law violation, and you
will serve the same amount of time as a migratory bird offender.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The birds have it.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: That's right.  Drugs are for the birds.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, one of the things that we see at the Family Research 
Council when we try to track pathology is that people lie.  It is hard 
to get valid sex data because people don't want to be honest about their 
sexual habits.
<p>
The same problem exists in a way with drugs.  What are you seeing in 
terms of users?  How reliable is the data, and how many people are actually 
using drugs?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: It depends upon which survey you look at, obviously, and 
there are maybe 70 or 80 million Americans who are saying, &quot;Yeah, I 
have used it in a certain period of time, maybe, over my life.&quot;
The numbers are going to be elevated depending upon the cohort
of people you are talking about.  The number of kids, probably
13 percent at a fairly young age, and the numbers are going up.
Once again, it depends upon the sector, it depends upon the racial
breakdown.
<p>
I did want to say something following up what Bob said,
and I don't think a lot of our viewers may understand that when
you start looking at people that are incarcerated, the people
that are trying to say drugs are not a big problem will not acknowledge
that a lot of these felons that are in jail right now for violent
crimes were using or had used recently, prior to that crime, an
illicit drug.  And that may have had a role in their particular
lifestyle choice that led them to the felony which landed them
in jail.
<p>
Unfortunately, if we don't arrest the scourge of drugs
on our land, we are just to continue to see this, especially as
the young cohort of teenagers today grows older, or the young
kids that are being raised in some pretty dysfunctional settings
grow older and become the killers of the next decade, and we are
faced with a critical crisis that is going to be really promoted
by drug abuse.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Sally, right now we have a very strange situation 
where the government indicates that cigarette use is very, very bad, but 
maybe marijuana should be legal.
<p>
But as you look at the people involved in drugs, are cigarettes a gateway 
to marijuana, a gateway to harder drugs? Is it broken families? What are 
some of the risk factors for the people who actually end up being drug 
users?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Well, I think the first thing you mentioned was some sort of 
analogy between nicotine and other drugs, and I think that is a dangerous 
analogy to make. Certainly from a public health standpoint, tobacco is 
very dangerous -- lung cancer, heart disease, et cetera -- but in terms of 
erosion of family life, of moral values, of capacity to function in society
and to adhere to your responsibilities as a parent, employee,
a citizen, that is where drugs are trouble, and I don't see too
many people smoking cigarettes who cannot abide by the law.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is a fascinating point, because in the cigarette
discussion, one of the points that has been made occasionally
is that cigarettes are really just as bad as drugs.  But that
is not your experience.
<p>
DR. SATEL:  When they say that, they refer often, I think, to the addictive 
potential of cigarettes.  And, yes, it is hard to quit cigarettes.  On the 
other hand, the consequences for using cigarettes aren't as immediate and 
as dangerous as for using hard drugs.  So I think the analogy is strained.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to take a look 
at the controversy surrounding crack cocaine and powder cocaine incarceration
rates. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. As many of you may 
know, Rev. Jesse Jackson has made a lot of news lately talking about how 
the way in which we prosecute drugs is in fact racist; that crack cocaine 
offenders, generally black, are treated more harshly than those who use 
powder cocaine.
<p>
Bob, what is your perspective on that?  In our treatment of drug crime, 
do you see racist overtones?
<p>
MR. PETERSON:  I don't think it is racism.  What I have done in a study is 
I have looked at every crime -- violent crime, robbery, rape, murder -- 
and what I did is I measured the percentage of black and white victims
and then looked at the percentage of black and white imprisonments,
and what I found is that it always parallels the victim rate;
in other words, who is going to prison is based on who is being
victimized by these crimes.
<p>
Now, with the crack and the powder cocaine, they are identical chemically. 
They are identical substances. However, if you look at -- an analogy I would 
give is with an automatic machine gun and a hunting rifle and say, &quot;Gee,
they both shoot the same bullets, so they should carry the same
sentence.&quot;  One has a delivery mechanism that is a lot faster.
 The guy who is selling crack makes a lot more on an ounce of
cocaine than the one who is selling powder.  He is making more
profit and he is causing more immediate problems because of the
quickness that it goes to the brain, basically, and addiction
specialists say the quicker you get high, the quicker you drop
down, the quicker you get addicted.
<p.
The other thing is they use the federal crack laws as an example.  Under 
the federal crack laws, if you take the federal crack possession violators 
who are black and say what percent are they of the whole prison population,
it is six one-hundredths of 1 percent.  It is a very small population.
Eighty percent of those people were dealing, and the average
amount of crack they were dealing was 18,800 doses.
<p>
Now, does the difference have to be 100 to 1?  In other words, for 100 
grams of powder cocaine, should that equal 1 gram of crack?  I am not
saying that.  Maybe it should be 10 to 1.  You should look at
basically how much will an ounce of cocaine make of crack and
make it proportional.  So it does not have to be 100 to 1.  They
do have a point.  It might be a little too far.  But I do think
there is a definitely a difference, and the law has to recognize
that, and the reason there is a difference was because of the
devastation to the innocent victims in these communities where
crack ravaged their neighborhoods.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Have you seen drug crimes in general being weighted by race at 
all, or is it socioeconomic?  You said you took a look at the victims. 
What seems to mark the people who are most likely to be victims?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, for victims, of course, it is partly where you
live and who you are.  But young black males in this country are
victimized and murdered at a rate that is just appalling, and
people have to start paying attention to this.
<p>
Now, it was worse in the early 1970s when we had more lenient drug laws. 
The ratio was even worse.  But it is a very serious problem.  You know,
the number one likelihood of dying if you are a young black teenager
is murder.  And white America, all of America, has to start paying
attention to this.
<p>
But the answer is not to get weaker on drug crimes. Right now 70 percent 
of those who are even defendants for drugs are repeat offenders.  One 
in five have five or more prior felonies.  So we are not locking up a 
lot of first-timers, but if we concentrate on the first-timers with drug 
testing, fines, coordinated with treatment, we can avert the problem.
<p>
But the point is that it is based on victimization, and in fact for 
arrests, even though we incarcerate more blacks than whites for drugs,
we arrest more whites than blacks for drugs, even in the inner
city.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we look at treatment options, Bob, you have taken a 
look at a lot of different things that are being tried.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What is working?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, there are a few that seem to be working. Faith-based
organizations -- I can think of Johnny Garcia down in San Antonio,
who has a better than 80 percent success rate.  So faith-based
organizations -- and there is something about it that is just
turning people around completely, whereas a lot of traditional
programs don't have nearly that sort of success rate.
<p>
One comes to mind that we were talking about yesterday, and it has to do
with what happened in Vietnam.  You know, we would take the dopeheads,
the people on heroin, and they couldn't go back to the States.
They couldn't get on the Freedom Bird to fly out of Saigon until
they were clean and they were tested to be clean, and when they
were clean, then they could get on that Freedom Bird and come
home.  Bob mentioned yesterday to us in the conference we had
that 88 percent didn't return to using dope again.
<p>
And so that is a testimony to the fact, I believe, that self-will can 
govern to a certain degree this whole issue of treatment.  Now, of 
course, we are going to hear from Sally on treatment.  But I wanted 
to follow up just a second on what Bob said in that the politicians
in this country, I think, are listening to what the people are
saying, and the courts maybe aren't quite as sensitive, because
we have a clash over this crack-powder cocaine issue between what
the Sentencing Commission is telling federal judges to do and
what the politicians are passing mandatory minimums and saying
this is what you are going to do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: And that clash is really reflective of the differences
of opinion about how we should treat drugs.
<p>
And so, yes, we do have a crisis, and as Bob articulated very well, we 
have a crisis, unfortunately, with crack and young black drug dealers 
out there. But by legalizing it, that is no solution to this terrible 
scourge that is on our land.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Sally, some people don't think that treatment 
is a solution, either.  There is this sense that we have to legalize 
drugs, we have to treat crack cocaine more leniently, because there 
is nothing else that we can do. Is treatment a viable option when we 
are looking at people who are addicted to drugs?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Treatment is a viable option, and I always say, if you 
legalize it, I'll just have more business, because there will be 
more addicts.  I am sure of that.
<p.
But what I want to point out is that treatment is a very important 
component of any kind of drug strategy.  Right now there is a fair 
amount of relapse, especially among hard core users, when they come 
out of treatment.  But what is very important to remember is that
treatment may not work as well as we like, and I think it can
work a lot better -- and I can get to that in a minute -- but
it is very much a worthwhile investment.
<p>
The ratio of savings in costs averted of medical care, of criminal 
justice, property crime, employment time lost, the ratio of gain in 
those areas to money spent on treatment is in the neighborhood of 
one dollar for treatment to between four and seven dollars saved in 
those areas.  It is a very worthwhile social investment.
<p>
The second issue, though, is how to make treatment work better, and 
there are several things.  One very important principle in treatment
is retention.  The longer you stay, the better you do.  The problem
is, there is a high dropout rate.
<p>
One thing we should be thinking about very seriously is how to get 
people to stay longer.  Now, one obvious way to do that might be that we 
will make treatment more attractive.  Well, the point is, a lot of people 
don't want to come to treatment, and one solution is to compel them to 
come to treatment.
<p>
Now, we do that in the drug court where I work because the individuals 
are given a choice --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: They can go to jail, that's right.
<p>
DR. SATEL: Which some choose, which gives you an indication of the 
aversion some people have to treatment. Why? Because it separates them 
from their drug.  So we can use that sort of coercion through the legal 
system.
<p>
There is another strategy that I would like to see revived.  Laws are 
still on the books for this in most states, but they have not been 
used, and that is what is called the civil addict.  That is a commitment
procedure.  It is basically putting people in treatment against
their will.  These would be people who are so ravaged by drugs
that they can't even make decisions; they can't care for themselves.
They have subjugated all their other needs and responsibilities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Perhaps the homeless, some of the homeless that
are so drug addicted?
<p>
DR. SATEL: They would be a key population.
<p>
Another important point I want to make is that studies have shown
some very nice work by a researcher at UCLA that you don't have
to want to.  Everybody thinks that in order to get better with
treatment, you have to want to; it has to be voluntary.  And what
he has shown is that people who were coerced into treatment through
these legal means did as well in five-year follow-ups in terms
of their employment, in terms of their abstinence, and in terms
of their uninvolvment with the criminal justice system as those
who voluntarily finished.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But in terms of you have to want to, if they didn't want 
to, how did those people without the legal ability to make them go, 
how were they put in?
<p>
DR. SATEL: No, they were put in.  That's my point.  Many of the people 
who finished were put in.  And then others did enter on their own
volition, of course, because of pressure from family or employer.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: I would say, with the point you raise, though,
about if drugs were legal, you would have more business, I think
you might go out of business, because the number one referral
source for treatment is the criminal justice system, and people,
as you know, generally don't seek it out a lot of times unless
they are pushed either by family or by the criminal justice system.
So I wonder if your business would be damaged because people
wouldn't be in treatment if it wasn't for the criminal justice
system.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going
to take a closer look at the marriage of prosecution and treatment.
Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>, where we are 
taking a deep look at what is going on with the drug issue in America. 
Right now we are looking at the marriage of prosecution and treatment.
<p>
Bob, you were saying that if drugs were legal, we might not have any 
more treatment.  What is your experience telling you?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, that the studies that I have seen show that the 
number one referral source for treatment is the criminal justice 
system, and what we are doing is increasingly becoming more successful
at using the justice system to both get people into and out of
treatment, but really, the basic aim is to get people off drugs,
whether they go to formal treatment or not, whether they go to
AA or NA, which are volunteer groups that are really the most
successful, and any good treatment program sends people to AA
and NA, which are anonymous groups.
<p>
In Michigan, for example, we had a program where, if a felon had a drug 
problem, and when they are released in the community, they sign a 
contract with the court, and it says I will be drug tested three times 
a week, so if I'm using, I'm going to get caught, because the cocaine
stays in your system at least a couple of days.  I am going to
be drug tested three times a week -- if it is alcohol, it could
be every day of the week -- and if I test dirty, I go to jail
the first time for three days, the next time for seven days, the
next time for 30 days, the next time for 45 days.
<p>
What we found was 77 percent over five years being drug tested that 
frequently were drug free and rearrested, whether they went to formal 
treatment or not, and the key is that some people need formal treatment,
and some addicts will get off without that.  They will get off
with the AA and NA.  And so you save resources if the court says
my focus isn't on going to treatment; my focus is you have to
be drug free.
<p>
So if you come in to me, I say, &quot;Look, here's a number. If you 
need help to get free of drugs, you call them. They'll help you. 
They've got your name.  But I don't care if you go to treatment. If 
you're not drug-free on Monday, bring your toothbrush.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sally, what do you think about that?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Oh, I think Bob is right that the criminal
justice system can be an excellent way to identify patients and,
for those who have to go to treatment, a great way to provide
leverage.  But I think what you were describing -- it is also
called coerced abstinence -- can be extremely effective.
<p>
Another dimension of the problem that may be useful in getting people
to decide to come off drugs is the fact that our society actually
enables quite a bit of drug use because entitlements are available
to people who use drugs.  We have supplemental security income,
social security disability insurance, veterans' benefits, AFDC,
public housing.  These all go to people who actively use drugs.
<p>
I think, for example, that what New York City is doing in terms
of considering drug testing for welfare recipients and heavy screening
of people who are entering public housing programs are very important
interventions.  If you kick the government props out from under
addicts, the world is going to start closing in, and they have
two choices:  stop or go to treatment.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: I want to follow up on that in that in industry there 
are a lot of good programs today that we are not hearing about, and 
they are insisting upon testing, they are doing education programs, and 
they are putting the person's job on the line.  If they don't get clean
-- and they will provide help -- but if you don't get clean, you
don't have a job, and that is quite an incentive.
<p>
And parents who go through such a program, and they see their children 
begin to experiment with drugs, are beginning to communicate to them,
&quot;Look, you're going to ruin your life.  You need to get off
this stuff before it takes you down the primrose path.&quot;
<p>
Now, also, we need to consider what the message is that our kids are
seeing.  You know, they are out there listening to hundreds of
hours of bad music, some bad television, some bad movies, and
the media is really guilty of glamorizing drug use.  You know,
they think it makes them sexier, they think it makes them look
physically more powerful, that they are going to be smarter for
some reason, some pretty bad messages that are corrupting our
youth.  And somehow we have to turn that around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It was very interesting.  On an episode of <i>Friends</i>, 
the hottest sitcom out right now, they had Marlo Thomas on as the mother 
asking the daughters, &quot;Where do we get the best drugs these days?
What's hot?&quot;  It was a very unfortunate attitude.
<p>
But I wanted to ask you, too, Sally, and have you follow up with this,
Bob, is defining drug use as a disability or an illness, is that
part of the problem?  So now you are disabled.  So here's a federal
supplement.  Do you see that as the wrong message to send about
drug use?
<p>
DR. SATEL: I think there is a problem with over-medicalizing
addiction.  Certainly there are biological and health components
to using drugs.  Their effects obviously affect the body, and
when someone is severely addicted, their brain really is compromised.
I mean, it's the old egg on the frying pan -- this is your brain
-- and they can't make rational decisions.  So there is certainly
a biological component, but biology isn't necessarily destiny
here, and I think there is a tendency for people to then feel,
well, the locus of control here is outside of me.
<p>
One very unfortunate manifestation of that was a program under 
supplemental security income which considered drug addiction a disability, 
so that if you were disabled -- in order words, if you were too 
intoxicated to work -- you could get supplemental security income.
<p>
Now, that program was examined by Congress a few years ago, and while 
it is still on the books as a disability, at least a treatment component
was built in and the benefits were made contingent upon attending
treatment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So once again it's the carrot and the stick,
and it is a big stick.
<p>
DR. SATEL: Oh, very much.  It is called contingency management in this 
field, and it can be very, very powerful.  I would like to see, as 
someone who has worked in the Veterans Administration for a while, I 
would like to see veterans' benefits, which can be very generous, up to 
$1,800 a month, I would like to see them be contingent upon veterans who 
have drug problems and who are mentally ill and have drug problems, 
contingent upon their compliance with treatment, taking their 
medication when necessary, and providing clean urines when asked.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Bob, is the disability issue a problem?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Oh, clearly, and I endorse what she said on the veterans. 
You know, we have a lot of young and old veterans that, for a variety 
of reasons, some of which, you know, they will go back to their days in 
Vietnam, and they will say, &quot;Well, because of the psychological 
impact of the devastation that I saw, I am high today on heroin.&quot;
Well, we need to help them work through it, but somehow we have
to test them, we have to facilitate the process of leaving drugs
behind, and clearly, that is a good example.  But there are other
programs, and we should not be spending government -- taxpayer
-- money out there to endorse and promote drug addiction.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Bob, some people think we are coddling our
criminals by having treatment as the first round.  Do you think
that that is true, that a disability way of looking at it is a
problem?  Or do you think treatment is the first line of defense
before prison is the way to go?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: I think enforced abstinence is the first line of 
defense, and whether that means treatment or not, I think again we 
are assuming that to get off drugs, you have to go to treatment, 
and all the studies show that is not true for everybody. As I said, 
88 percent of the Vietnam vets got off heroin without going to 
formal treatment.  We are talking about they did just as well whether 
they went and saw a counselor or did not.
<p>
So some people need formal treatment, some don't, but the focus on 
the criminal justice system has to be abstinence from drugs, not 
treatment.  We are not there to fill treatment centers.  It's there 
to make sure, when that person is released in the community, they 
are drug-free.
<p>
Now, the other thing is, I would not go into prisons and take the 
dangerous that are there -- 95 percent of our prisoners are repeat or 
violent offenders; they are not first-time drug offenders -- I would 
not take them out and put them on these programs.  I would take people
getting what I call meaningless probation.  I talk to kids, and
I say, &quot;How many know somebody on probation?  Do you think
that's serious?&quot; and they all start laughing.  Well, make
probation drug testing with progressive sanctions.  Make these
disability and welfare payments -- don't cut off the welfare mother
the first time she tests dirty; say now you don't get your benefit
for two weeks.  Now you don't get your benefit for three weeks.
Use it for behavior modification, but make sure you are going
to catch the person as soon as they do it and that you are going
to take progressively tougher action each time.
<p>
And this applies to parents, and I think that is the most important 
thing, is that everything we are talking about goes back to the home. 
I had the alcohol industry -- they have a thing called Sensory Council
-- call me, and they said, &quot;What could we do?  What could
we do legitimately that you would support?&quot;  I said, &quot;Well,
go out of business would be good.&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But they weren't willing to shut down their doors and go out of business. 
So I said, &quot;Well, the one thing I think you ought to do is, there's
a test, a saliva test, a little cotton swab saliva test for alcohol.&quot;
I said, &quot;Every parent of people from 11 to 20 years old
should have a supply of these.&quot;
<p>
I told my sons -- I have six children, and I have four sons and two 
daughters -- and I said to my oldest, I said, &quot;We run the Ronald 
Reagan School of Parenting.&quot;  And he said, &quot;What's that?&quot; 
And I said, &quot;It's called trust but verify.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So once again, Bob, we find that verified accountability 
and self-discipline are keys to success.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: That is right. You know, one of the things with treatment, 
when you tell people they can't govern their behavior, they have an 
excuse not to.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to take
a look at some of the solutions that we as individuals and a society
can enact.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Recently there was a national drug strategy session here at 
the Family Research Council, and Bob, you directed this day-long event.
What was the goal for the meeting of the minds?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, we wanted to put together a straightforward, simple 
strategy that we could turn over to Presidential candidates and have them,
at the national conventions this summer, make part of their platforms.
We wanted to address the issues that we talked about today, and
we want to permeate the country with the message that drug abuse
is serious, it is not going to go away, we have to make it a national
priority, and we want those Presidential candidates to embrace
that and run with the ball.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And, Sally, you were saying that one of the things that 
we need to enact this program is some money. But it is who gets the 
money that is a problem. What were you indicating for us?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Money in terms of disability payments? Yes, my point was 
that as a clinician, the reason I got interested in these issues was 
because, when I worked at a hospital, all my patients were getting 
entitlement money, and they were turning around and using it to buy 
drugs.
<p>
Now, as a clinician, here I see that the monies they were 
getting to help them live better lives, basically to provide for their 
basic needs, were going to make their conditions worse; and when my 
patients had a concurrent mental illness -- if they had schizophrenia,
for example, it literally made their schizophrenia worse.  They
became more psychotic, more delusional, more agitated.  So what
we had was a situation where the money they were getting because
they were ill made them even more sick.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I would like each of you to go around.  You all participated 
in this discussion in last week's strategizing.  Bob, of the things that 
you all discussed, what do you think are some of the programs that are
really powerful from that law enforcement perspective?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, I think, first of all, it was very significant that 
the Family Research Council brought everybody together to do this,
because one of the big problems we have in this country, whether
it is law enforcement, treatment, or prevention, is that people
are not getting together to talk about this issue anymore, and
they are not pushing the issue forward, and they are not mentioning
it to the candidates, and whether it is President Clinton at all
his former State-of-the-Unions or whether it is the Contract with
America, the word &quot;drugs&quot; wasn't in either document.
So it is significant that we got together.
<p>
In the law enforcement area, one of the things we talked about was the 
drug testing of offenders with accountability.  Another thing was that 
the casual user -- we have to realize that that casual user is the one 
that is really fueling the drug problem.  We all like to focus on the
addict or on the people that don't have economic resources, but
it is that yuppie in Wall Street that is really fueling this trade
and getting away with it, and it is that Yuppie in Wall Street
that is more deterred by a minor jail sentence and sitting next
to some Bowery bums in the jail cell than the guy who is selling
drugs, let's say, in the inner city, because the guy in the inner
city, it's a badge of courage.  They have another notch.  I was
in prison again, you know, great job, well done.  But the guy
on Wall Street is deterred.  So those were two important things.
<p>
The other thing we talked about was the federal budget, that we
don't necessarily need more money, which I am sure Republican
candidates will be glad to hear.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Will be very glad to hear.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: The problem is reallocating the money we have. For 
instance, of the health care, the health care budget is, I don't 
know what, three to six times of any justice budget.
The total budget for state and local justice and for drug control
is 1.5 percent, okay?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, out of this health care budget, HHS -- our 
Department of Health and Human Services  -- allocates 1 percent of its 
budget, from what I read, to drugs.  The Department of Justice allocates 
50 percent.  So what does HHS say?  Well, if you want us to do treatment,
we have to take some of the Justice budget.  No.  If drugs are
driving 30 or 40 percent of your health care costs, Congress should
tell HHS, &quot;You shall allocate 30 percent of your budget to
drugs.  You find a way to do it.  Find the things that you are
over-allocating to, and you can have treatment on demand for everybody
in this country without raising a penny of tax money.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sally, from a treatment perspective, what were some
of the initiatives that came out of the meeting that you were
really excited about?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Well, one thing I would like to see and we talked about 
was having more capacity for long-term residential treatment. This 
is treatment that lasts between a year and two years.  Its goal is to 
really socially transform the individual.  We are talking now about hard 
core users.
<p>
While the drug problem, as you are saying, may be fueled in large part
by casual users, the economic burdens are extracted by the very
heavy users.  These are people who, when they go to a place, for
example, like Phoenix House, what Phoenix House addresses is not
the drug; they address the addict and the notion that the person
has turned to drugs because of a deeper personal disturbance,
and there is a lot of rebuilding of character, of capacity, that
those treatment programs do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Fantastic.
<p>
Bob, I have to commend you.  After a long career in the military and law 
enforcement angles, you were the one that said this drug problem is a 
problem; let's get together.  This was certainly your brain child.
<p>
From a public policy standpoint, Bob, what are you excited about in
terms of this drug issue?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, it permeates all aspects of society.  It is 
driving our economy in a way that most people don't recognize. It is 
killing a lot of our kids, and it is killing a lot of older people.
<p>
But I see this issue really comes down to one issue, and that is 
leadership. The leadership starts at the top.  The President of the 
United States, like Ronald Reagan and Nancy at his side, needs to stand 
in front of every person in America and say, &quot;Don't do drugs. 
Drugs are bad.  They're going to hurt you.&quot;  Now, you get that 
sort of example, you identify the problem, you give them solutions, 
and you set a good role model.
<p>
Now, that has to go all the way down to the kitchen
table where Mom and Dad sit down with their son, their daughter,
and they do the things that Bob talked about earlier.  &quot;I
love you, but I'm going to test you.  I'm going to check out your
school environment, your friends, because I love you, and I want
to keep you off this, because I know this could devastate your
life.&quot;
<p>
So if we could get our politicians, our leaders, our
parents, our community leaders involved in this issue, as we must,
because it is a national emergency, then we can turn this scourge
around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So as much as we are looking at treatment
and enforcement, for you it is a philosophical leadership issue
that is really causing some of the problems?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, if you have the leaders together, everything 
else is going to fall in line.  They are going to prioritize the 
funding, they are going to prioritize the law enforcement.  They are 
going to get the media whipped into shape to do the right sort of 
thing. You know, it is really leadership.  If we have good leadership
on this issue, we can defeat the enemy; we can win the drug war.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I would like to thank my guests for being with us
today, and I hope that you will call Family Research Council for
more information on any of these programs or some of the policy
related to drugs.  Please stay tuned.

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk</i>. 
If you would like to receive more information about the Family Research
Council, tonight's guests, or the topics we discussed, call us
at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week we will take a look at a sensitive, life-enhancing and 
life-changing issue for parents and children: adoption. If adoption 
is viewed as the best alternative to unwed pregnancy by the majority 
of Americans, why is it so hard for couples to adopt children in our 
own country?  We'll find out next week as we talk to individuals who 
have been affected and involved in the adoption issue when we bring 
you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Thanks 
for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
looks at an issue that seems to have been, in the past two decades of 
abortion discussion, swept under the carpet: adoption.
<p>
Although most Americans believe that adoption is the best response to 
an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, in 1991, 41 percent of out-of-wedlock 
pregnancies ended in abortion. Of the 44 percent carried to term, only 2 
percent of those children were placed for adoption.  Before 1973 when 
abortion was legalized, about one in five not-marital births to white 
women, for example, were placed for abortion.  But by the late 1980s, 
the number of children placed for adoption dropped drastically to one 
in 30.
<p>
This change has taken place at a time when rising infertility
rates show that one couple in four today cannot have children.
We'll delve into these issues and more in tonight's discussion.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Phil Olsen, the Family Research Council's
Vice President for Resource Development.  Phil and his staff are
in constant contact with the public, so they know what current
issues are resonating with American families today.
<p>
I had the chance to talk to Phil about some of those concerns, so 
let's hear his insights into what the media may not be telling you,
as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are very excited that Phil could join us today on 
Behind the Headlines.  What are people telling you today? You have 
been in the field.  It's hard to even see you sometimes in the office, 
Phil.  When you're out there in recent weeks, what are people saying, 
&quot;Look, this is the number one thing that I am worried about?&quot;
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Well, I think that today, I think the thing that we hear 
the most is that they are very concerned about the direction our country 
is headed. They are very concerned about the moral decline that they 
see. They are very concerned about the disintegration of our society,
the difficulties that families have today just trying to be a
family.  And these are some of the things that we hear repeatedly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Are the political things here in Washington making
the top ten list of family concerns?  Are you finding it's more
fear of the personal and the breakdown in the personal around
them?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, I think that one of the things that we
continue to hear is that people seem to be very skeptical of the
media.  They don't feel like the media is shooting straight. 
They feel like the media is running a public relations campaign
for this administration, and I think that they are very puzzled
by some of that.  They want the truth.  They would like the straight
scoop.
<p>
I think that, given the truth, they have the ability to
make up their mind where they want to come down on the issues.
But I think that there is a general consensus that they are not
receiving the truth all the time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that explains in part the growth of groups 
like the Family Research Council?  You know, where are people going to 
go for that kind of information they are looking for?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I think that is absolutely the case.  I think that people are 
realizing that they need to look to organizations who can provide them 
with information that is reliable.  I think that that is something that 
has set the Family Research Council apart.  People have come to realize
that they can depend on the research that is produced by the Family
Research Council.  They can rely on the work that we are doing
here on their behalf.  I think, to be honest with you, that is
probably the primary thing that has led to the growth that we
have seen in the Family Research Council in just the last few
years.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that as you are meeting a lot
of people who are turning toward their family issues, is there
a thought that it is more the personal that is impacting or the
government?  Where are people concerned about in terms of the
impacts negatively on their family?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, again, I think that there is a range out there in 
terms of people's understanding of the political process.  I think 
there is a great frustration that exists, because they don't really 
understand a lot of what is happening in this country.  There has been 
for many, many years a sense that when you elect a representative and 
send them to Washington, D.C., they are going to do what is in the best 
interest of the family, or so you think.  And, unfortunately, in too 
many cases, the reverse has actually come to pass, where these elected
officials are not doing what is in the best interest of their
constituents.  They are being coerced into making decisions that
might be in the best interest of a small minority group or a small
special interest group, and that is not what is best for our country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Phil, we thank you so much for being with us in
Behind the Headlines and look forward to seeing you again.
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I thank you, Kristi.  It has been great to be with you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares insights of some experts who have researched the adoption issue.
We'll find out why adoption is no longer mainstream.  Please
stay tuned.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are talking about adoption.  I am joined by Gracie 
Hsu, a Family Research Council policy analyst, who has looked extensively 
at the legal entanglements that surround adoption.  Also joining me is 
Bill Pierce, President of the National Council on Adoption, whose 
organization is spearheading proposed adoption changes; and Chris Casey, 
Executive Director of the Campaign for the American Family, who is 
currently organizing an adoption seminar this spring. Welcome to the 
show.
<p>
Gracie, we certainly welcome you back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. You
have been studying adoption for a while.  What have you seen in
adoption trends?  We looked at some disturbing numbers in the
first segment about a tremendous decline.  What are you finding
out?
<p>
MS. HSU:  What we are finding out is that fewer teenagers
and fewer people who have unwed pregnancies and births are choosing
adoption.  Whereas there used to be maybe a significant number
of pregnancies that would end in adoption, and especially if they
were unwed, now we are looking at about 2 percent.
<p>
NCFA has done a great job in tracking these trends over time, but 
what we're seeing is that the laws, also, when it comes to adoption, 
have not been encouraging this; in fact, they have been trying to make
it so it is less popular, especially in foster care situations,
where it makes it even more difficult for adoptions to take place.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bill, actually, I have been acquainted with your
organization for 10 years.  I have been here in Washington long
enough to say that.  What have you seen with the laws surrounding
adoption?  Are they hostile, actually, to its being accomplished?
<p>
DR. PIERCE: Well, they are, because if you think about it for
a second, our tax laws are one example.  Our tax laws provide
benefits for people through deductions if they decide to have
a child biologically.  Our tax laws even provide deduction if
someone medically decides to terminate a pregnancy.  But our tax
laws have no benefit whatsoever if someone tries to adopt.
<p>
So one of the things we have been trying to do, as Gracie knows and
as Chris knows, is to work for an adoption tax credit to be passed
at the federal level to make it possible for more people to adopt.
<p>
One of the big things that would help to really reprivatize adoption,
that would empower ordinary people, that would help change the
system in a dramatic way, would be to put a $5,000 refundable
tax credit as part of adoption.
<p>
The nice thing about it, it is one of those things which is bipartisan 
in its origin. We have both Democrats and Republicans that like it. Newt 
Gingrich thinks it's a great idea.  I was at the American Enterprise 
Institute the other day, and I heard David Bonior say that he would 
endorse it.
<p>
I think the challenge now is for us to see whether the Congress,
which is always talking a lot, can actually put a small, simple
piece of legislation together and put it through without turning
it into a Christmas tree and hanging everything that we would
like to see on one piece of legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But that's a fraction of adoption costs, are they not? I 
mean, what does the average adoption today cost?
<p>
DR. PIERCE: Well, there's a tremendous range, but I would say somewhere 
between $6,000 all the way up to $30,000.  But $5,000 would make the key 
difference for lots and lots of people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Chris, your organization has targeted adoption as something 
that is one of your goals. Why?
<p>
MR. CASEY:  Well, my father, the former governor of Pennsylvania,
Bob Casey, when he was governor, made adoption a top priority,
and he thinks that it's time for the national government to do
the same thing.
<p>
We have a lot of people out there who have done great things in the 
adoption area privately, but we don't see a national effort by our 
government to make it a top priority. We think it's time that that 
happened, and I think if that happens, if you have rhetorical change, 
in addition to legislation change that Bill has talked about, that people 
will start to see it as the positive, life-affirming option that it is, 
and I think then you will see that the number of adoptions start to 
increase, and, hopefully, through the work that we are doing, bringing 
people together to talk about the many problems and barriers that currently
exist in the system, we can have some real changes, I think, relatively
quickly.  I think that it is the kind of issue that has not seen
its potential on the national level, and I think it is a perfect
time for it, because we see the tremendous social costs that go
along with family disintegration.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, your father, who is a Democrat -- a lot of people think 
that this is a Republican issue, but it's really not -- chose adoption. Do 
you think because it was difficult in Pennsylvania or because he wanted 
to make it easier? Why adoption?
<p>
MR. CASEY:  Well, he has always been a strong pro-life advocate and has 
seen the tremendous dichotomy and schizophrenia, if you will, where people 
in this country will go to China, to Russia, to Latin America to adopt a 
child.  They will jump through all sorts of hoops and at tremendous 
personal sacrifice.
<p>
At the same time, when you have 4,400 children being
aborted every day, that is a situation that obviously is out of
balance, and I think he saw that operating on the state level
and wanted to do something on the national level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting that you would think adoption would be 
the common ground where pro-life Americans and people who support
some kind of legalized abortion would be able to come together.
But it doesn't seem like that is what really happens.  Gracie,
what is your experience?
<p>
MS. HSU:  Well, what is interesting is that public opinion polls 
overwhelmingly say that people are in favor of adoption. If you are 
given four options as to an unwed teenager who is pregnant, what should 
she do, the number one answer is always adoption.  That gets the most 
votes out of everything else. And the least popular is abortion, and in 
between there is marry the father and to have the baby and raise it 
herself.
<p>
But even though public opinion is high on adoption, what we are
finding is that people don't practice this, and much of the reason
why is because we see a social trend that says illegitimacy is
okay.  We are growing in illegitimacy statistics.  People are
having kids outside of wedlock in their thirties and forties,
even, and it is perfectly normal. People accept this.
<p>
There is also the fact that abortion really changes the entire 
equation; that once you have abortion, most people are concentrated 
on do I want this baby or do I want to abort.  They are not thinking
what is best for this baby.  They are not thinking child-centered.
They are thinking what is best for me in my circumstances.
<p>
And so until we can reach beyond the selfish need, and once they start
to focus on the child, then they do realize that adoption is the
best alternative.  But it takes a while to get there now.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: One of the things that strikes me as interesting about
the challenge that we face in terms of promoting adoption as we
should is that I think even if you put aside the issue of abortion,
which is obviously a key issue, and you just look at it from the
point of view of economic conservatism, there's a lot that needs
to be done, because in town -- and I have been in this city now
for 26 years -- I have heard very seldom what I would call the
economic conservatives, the libertarians, really focusing on adoption,
I think, the way they should.
<p>
I don't think that they understand that if you talk about welfare reform, 
if you talk about independence, if you talk about all of the issues that 
are critical to economic conservatives, that adoption is a real solution 
here. This is a way to take a pregnancy which is untimely and which may 
have tremendous social and economic negatives for a whole variety of
people and turn it on the flip side and make it an economic positive.
<p>
I mean, if you just take the comparison between a lot of state
laws that provide mandated insurance coverage for infertility
treatment -- infertility treatment is basically about a $35,000
procedure for a 25 percent chance of having a healthy baby.  Well,
if you compare that to adoption, adoption is, at most, on average,
a $15,000 cost for a 100 percent chance of having a healthy baby,
and economic conservatives should see that as a great bargain.
<p>
They should also see it as a great bargain in terms of preventing
welfare dependency, of preventing secondary pregnancies, of preventing
divorce because people got married when they were not really wanting
to.
<p>
So I think one of the things that particularly <i>Straight Talk</i>
and the Family Research Council has been great at doing is in
getting out to economic conservatives and giving the message to
them that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It costs less.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: -- leaving the issues of morality aside, economic conservatives 
should really start focusing also on the issues of adoption.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So many broken wheels end up with a broken-down adoption 
system, and I would like us to look a little bit at foster care.  You
know, one of the things that we have seen as an impact -- and
I would like you all to say what you all have seen -- in adoption
is the fact that in foster care, sometimes we are spending years
and years and years of a child's life not severing damaged parental
bonds and allowing that child to go out of the welfare system
and into a stable married home.  We are holding children sort
of in perpetual child jail.
<p>
The Gregory K. situation, for example, when the boy tried to divorce his 
mother, could have been resolved with a severing of a very damaging 
parental relationship early. I don't think that should be taken by any of 
us to think that we don't want to hold families together when possible. 
<p>
But tell me what you're seeing, for example, with foster care, where 
children are there for their entire life, transferred from home to home
with no future.
<p>
MR. CASEY: It's a very tragic situation.  We hear a lot of tragic stories 
of kids being bounced between the birth home and the foster home.
<p>
Foster care costs about $10 billion, the state and federal costs together, 
whereas, as Bill points out, adoption is basically a cost-free solution.
<p>
I think foster care was originally intended as a temporary home for kids 
and oftentimes ends up being semi-permanent; in some cases, permanent.
And it cannot replace an adoptive home where you have loving,
willing parents who will care for the child, and that is the option
we should be pushing.  We need to move away from the long, prolonged
waits and go to a system where kids are given a better chance
and taken out of an abusive home on a more timely basis so they
don't spend so much time in foster care.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: One of the things that reminds me of the foster care issue 
is, indeed, some material that I got from Chris's organization the 
other day. There is a case up in Philadelphia involving Baby Mitch, 
which is a perfect example of what we're talking about.  Here we're
talking about a newborn baby which was abandoned.  Usually that
baby would end up going into the public foster care system, rattle
around the system, and be lucky if, in a year or two, that child
ended up being placed for adoption.
<p>
Well, they did something really radical, and they turned the baby 
over to the private charitable sector, and they said, &quot;Find a 
home for this child.&quot; And that is one of the things that we think 
would make real good sense, and in fact one of the things that we 
have been trying to push on the federal level is something called the 
Abandoned Babies Act, which was introduced by Representative Fawell from
Illinois, and what he is basically saying is, &quot;Look, we're
not trying to take anybody's rights away, but we ought to jump-start
the system so that if a baby is abandoned, you get that kid through
the system in a hurry and you get that kid into a permanent home.&quot;
<p>
Quite frankly, I think that the way to do that is to do what they
did in Philadelphia and what they have done before in some states,
and that is to basically say, &quot;Look, we're going to take
the issues that have to be done by the state -- the police powers,
like protective services -- and we're going to leave that in the
hands of the public welfare department.  But the other things
that can be contracted out, that can be given to the private voluntary
sector, we're going to give them those things to do.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are getting a lot of calls at Family Research Council
every day, people who are interested in adoption, and I've got
a list myself of people who want more information.
<p>
Chris, you are getting ready to have a conference.
<p>
MR. CASEY: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have very little time left.  Where can they call and 
what will they hear at your conference?
<p>
MR. CASEY: Well, they can call me at the offices, and the number is 
(703) 875-8724, and I will be happy to send them materials on the 
conference.
<p>
Dr. Pierce is helping us with the conference, and there are others, 
national adoption leaders, that we're going to convene.  We will have 
a seminar on May 9 here in Washington where we will bring together
experts to talk about the problems, and then in the fall we're
going to have a full-day conference in early October to expand
upon it and to talk about solutions.
<p>
I think one of the things that we would like to see is, if this 
government, the national government, can talk about putting 100,000 
cops on the street in high-crime areas, we think it's time that we 
worked towards the goal of 100,000 adoptions each year for the next 
five years. That would go a long way, we think, towards rebuilding the 
family in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is very exciting, and I would like to thank my 
guests.  Call Family Research Council for more information.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we introduce
you to an attorney who facilitates adoption and a couple whose
unique experience in adopting a child you won't want to miss.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome Barbara Jones, 
an adoption attorney who has facilitated many successful
adoptions, and Benny Phillips, pastor of Fairfax Covenant Church,
and his wife, Sheree.
<p>
The Phillipses have six biological children, which is amazing in 
itself, but they are here to share the story about their youngest 
daughter, number seven, Julia.
<p>
Thank you for being with us today.  Thanks so much.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Glad to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  This is so exciting.  We were talking about some of 
the legalities of adoption in the first segment, and it is very, 
very difficult.  But yours is a story that so many people call us 
about wishing they could adopt, and we get many, many calls.
<p>
Now, I am going to hold up a photo of your family. I think some 
people are going to have a hard time understanding
why, with this lovely family, you all had the yearning to adopt
and your passion for adoption.  Tell us why.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Well, about, I guess, 10 years ago, 10 or 11 years ago, 
God just dropped something in my heart that some day we would be 
adopting, and at that point we had only two children, I think.  Time 
passed; we continued to have children, as you see, and as we got more
involved in the pro-life issues and talked to various people,
their experiences of how you can serve and help as far as the
pro-life movement is concerned, one of the ways we felt like God
would have us get involved is through possibly a crisis pregnancy,
and that is how this all developed, was through a crisis pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sheree, do you remember that day?
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS: The day that she came?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The day you got your child.
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  As a matter of fact, we were contacted by
a mutual friend about a very young teenage girl who had scheduled
an abortion but had consented to talk to a couple, particularly
a pastor, about her decision, and we had the privilege of going
to meet her, along with her mother, to speak with her, to encourage
her, to express love to her and concern for her, and we were delighted
when, just a few days later, she called and had canceled the abortion
and asked us to consider taking her baby.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fantastic. And, Barbara, you helped facilitate that, 
I understand.
<p>
MS. JONES:  I had the great privilege of working with this precious
family.  Not only do they have a heart for children, but their
heart was very expandable.
<p>
I think some of the most exciting things that we went through were 
just the relationships that they were experiencing with the birth 
parents.  After they met the birth mother, they had the opportunity 
to go and meet the birth father, speak with him to see if in fact he 
was amenable to this particular family receiving his child.  That 
meant a great deal to him, and it established the rapport and the 
relationship for him to be able to relinquish his child as well and 
know his child would be in good hands.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are you finding as you have been handling adoptions? 
So many people are deterred and intimidated by the legal barriers, 
really, to adoption.  What are you finding in your practice to be 
true about the legal barriers to adoption?
<p>
MS. JONES:  Well, much of it is myth.  With some of the media
cases -- Baby Jessica, Baby Richard -- there is a tremendous fear
that is really evident when you speak to adoptive couples.  But
as we educate them and point out in some of these cases there
were actual legal errors that may not have been proclaimed by
the media and teach them that the relationship can make such a
difference, just in meeting the birth parents.  I think education
is really a key.
<p>
Also, there are the statistics.  There is such discouragement that 
there are not babies to adopt, which in fact, there are babies to 
adopt, and it is showing families how to meet birth parents, to link 
up with them for adoption.
<p>
I think another concern is cost.  It is very costly, and as a result 
of educating, and people like Benny and Sheree, pastors, doing it in 
their church, many churches have established funds to help the families 
with some of the costs to defray them, and also to be able to point
out other areas, if there are grants available, to direct families,
even to teach them such things as they can take loans against
life insurance policies, home equity loans; also, churches many
times just take an offering for the family.  So to encourage them
that if they really have a heart for it, there is a way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What were you surprised about?  As you began to have a 
passion for adoption as a solution to abortion, what surprised you as
you were learning?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think probably the thing that surprised us 
the most was how quickly you emotionally get involved in the process 
and how, as we began the process of adoption, particularly a 
trans-racial adoption, just how your heart -- talk about expandable 
heart -- just how your heart grows and expands for this whole issue, 
and you get to a place where you really want to be able to provide not 
only these children with homes and environments but to be able to serve 
people who are in crisis situations, that this is a viable option, and 
the church can do something about it, and to instruct even people
in our churches that, hey, here's an opportunity for us to carry
out the mission, to broaden our evangelism, and to really make
a difference in people's lives.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of people are afraid to adopt.  Were you all 
afraid to adopt?  Were you afraid about being a media case where someone 
was going to come back and say, &quot;I changed my mind&quot;?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  I think for about 15 minutes, and after Barbara talked 
to us and we asked that question and she was able to educate us as to 
what is really going on, it dissipated, and from that point on we didn't
carry any concern whatsoever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Tell me, Sheree, about the first moment that you saw 
the baby.  What was that like?
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS:  Well, it was a moment I'll never forget, because, to
be quite honest with you, I had some concerns about adoption.
Having had six biological children, having been told that we
would never have children, I received each of these children so
eagerly.  I was a little concerned, to be candid, that I would
have the affection and the love and the bonding that I experienced
with my biological children with an adopted child.
<p>
But because we were able to share the labor experience with our birth 
mom, we were able to be in an adjacent room and receive our little
baby girl, we heard her first cries and she was presented to us
still wrapped in her little newborn blanket, when the nurse walked
in and handed her to me, I can honestly say that in that moment
I knew this is my little daughter.  And the moments we had there,
an hour or so that we had with her, holding her, talking with
her, experiencing -- her maternal grandmother was there, and we
got to share that time with her -- was a precious moment.
<p>
For any adoptive mom that I speak with who has, understandably, 
similar concerns, I can say that the love that we have, the bond that
we share with our daughter Julia, is no different than that that
we have with our biological children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you find that as you -- you get to see this miracle 
regularly.
<p>
MS. JONES: I do.  One of the most fun questions is always to -- when 
I am working with folks that do have biological children or a biological
child and they are seeking to adopt or going through the process,
is to say to them afterwards, &quot;Please, tell me what it's
really like, because you've had the privilege of being a biological
parent and an adoptive parent.&quot;
<p>
Benny and Sheree were the two that did it best and in a most lasting 
way, in my memory. They said, &quot;Well, it's different but it's the 
same, but you love them just the same,&quot; and then the tears came, 
and they just can't put it in words, but what that showed me is that
there is truly a grafting into the heart, and they understand
more than us -- we were not adopted -- what it really is like
for the Lord to adopt children, that He loves us unconditionally,
and that always is the case.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very much so.
<p>
You get to see a lot of people long term. What do you find? People 
adopt once; they want to come back and adopt more children. You hear 
some people saying, &quot;Well, sure, it's great maybe at that 
moment, but what about later?  Does the shine wear off?&quot;
What are you finding as that has been your focus?
<p>
MS. JONES: The shine doesn't wear off.  For some families, they are 
satisfied when there are two siblings because there is a brother or 
a sister in the family, and often through agencies that is the limit.
In the past it has been maybe two children per family.  So sometimes
they are content with that.
<p>
Then you meet the family like the family that is down in Florida, the 
owner of the Orlando Magic team who has many children.  Occasionally I 
work with couples where there is no limit, and they come back for more 
and more and more. There is no limit to their love and their household.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is very, very exciting, and we want to actually
let people meet Julia.  If you want to come on and bring her in,
and this is your oldest daughter, I understand?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We would like to have you --
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: This is Jamie.  She is not our oldest, she is our oldest 
girl.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Oh, your oldest girl.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  We have a son 18 -- come here, sweetie.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Great.  Come on in to Dad.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  And this is Julia.  Come here.  Look at the camera. 
Everybody wants to see your pretty face.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So what have you found as your family has adjusted to 
this newest child?  What myths about adoption do you laugh at now that 
you look back?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  Oh, wow!  I mean, we do laugh at the
myth that you can't love an adopted child as much as one of your
own, because I can't make a -- there doesn't seem to be anything
distinguishable to me in the way we relate to her and how we feel
about her as I did when she was her age, you know.  And the children
-- I mean, to watch these children relate to her and how they
have taken her -- as a matter of fact, the problem is her kind
of ruling things.  And so that whole thing of, you know, it's
different -- do you love, do you bond -- I find that that may
be difficult at first for some to get through that moment, but
you do get through it.  You really do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's very exciting.  Thank you for sharing your story.
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS: Thank you so much.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear
about the other side of adoption as we meet a young woman who
went through two different experiences in placing two children
for adoption.  Stay tuned for more after this break.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  I would like to welcome back Barbara
Jones, an adoption attorney, and a good friend of Barbara's, Nicki
Scolaro, who has a unique and touching story to share about the
circumstances of placing two children for adoption.
<p>
Thank you very much, Barbara, for being back, and Nicki, for coming 
today. You placed two children for adoption, two different kinds of
adoption, closed and open, but tell us a little bit about why
that was a decision you made and how you came to make it.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Well, the first time I became pregnant, it was a situation
where abortion was not even a thought to me.  I just was raised
in a background and the family environment in which we just didn't
believe in abortion.  So I knew from the moment I found out I
was pregnant I was going to go with adoption.
<p>
With the first experience, I ended up going away to a maternity home. 
It was a very sheltered environment.  Counseling was provided.  But it 
was different in that only half of the girls actually placed their 
children for adoption, so it wasn't that that was what everybody did. 
But I knew what I was going to do from the moment I found out I was
pregnant, and it was a closed adoption.
<p>
It was just a situation where I described the type of family in which 
I would like my child to grow up, and they named some prospective 
clients only in a description of them.  I didn't meet anybody.  I 
don't know any names.  It was very closed, and after I had Lauren, my 
first child, I left the hospital 18 hours later and I had an hour to
say goodbye to everybody I had lived with for four or five months
and leave.
<p>
I had no contact for the first couple of weeks after
I returned home with the agency, and it was just all very standoffish
after that, and in that respect it was just not a positive experience
for me, just because so much was left to the imagination, and
there was just not a lot of comfort there, because I wasn't given
any information about --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you have a lot of fear about where your child was 
or --
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Yes.  I didn't know anything about the family.  My main 
concerns with that situation are, if something were to happen, would 
anybody ever tell me? How do they feel about me?  Situations like that 
where it's just, you know, when you are left with your imagination, you 
can imagine some pretty terrible things.  And when I came home, it was 
just a very awkward situation for my family.  It was a hard thing to
handle, and I ended up getting in a bad relationship and getting
pregnant again.
<p>
Actually, I was planning on keeping my second
daughter, simply because the adoption experience was not a positive
one, and I just didn't think it was possible to do it again. 
So, about six months into my pregnancy, I realized I was no more
equipped at that time to be a mother than I had been before, and
I still wanted to finish college and do things with my life, and
I just didn't see anything positive coming out of trying to raise
a baby on my own.
<p>
So that's when I decided to adopt again, or place for adoption again, 
and I knew there had to be a better way to do it, and it just so 
happens that I was living with a family who took me in as an unwed 
mother, and his doctor's nurse wanted to adopt. So I just called her 
and was like, &quot;I'm pregnant; do you want to talk?&quot;  I mean, 
it was a very awkward situation.  It just seemed so unnatural, like, 
&quot;Hi, do you want my baby?&quot;
<p>
So we actually ended up meeting, and just by luck we just fell in 
love with each other.  She and her husband are just wonderful people, 
and they had adopted before, and it just worked out so perfectly. I 
mean, it just doesn't seem like anything at all went wrong. I became 
very close with them, and they were actually in the room when Katherine 
was born. In fact, I was spending the night at their house and I went 
into labor, so they took me to the hospital.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A very much better experience.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Yes, totally the opposite extreme from Lauren's situation. 
And the comfort that I feel from knowing them so personally and seeing 
her house.  I know her dog and her older sister.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: I mean, there is just nothing left to my imagination. I 
don't have to wonder about anything, as well as for them, any questions 
she may one day have, they will be able to answer.  So it is a very 
positive experience.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think in the first -- there is a lot of discussion 
about how -- although a lot of women think adoption might be something 
they would like, that there really is a lot of need for counseling to 
deal with the emotions connected.
<p>
From your experience, would that have helped even the first time,
to have had someone there?
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Oh, definitely, definitely. When I came home from having 
had Lauren, I was in this emotional wilderness, and they pretty much 
didn't tell me what it was going to be like as far as -- you know, all 
they talked about was, &quot;Oh, you get to start school in a couple 
of months,&quot; and they talked about me as far as what I would do for 
the rest of my life, but not in relation to the loss I felt with -- I 
mean, there is a hole there.  You get -- all these maternal instincts 
come, and there is nothing there to take care of, and it's a hard 
thing to deal with, and I think, had I had counseling at that time,
I more than likely would not have gotten pregnant again.
<p>
But I ended up, once I did get pregnant again, I realized I had to 
have some help, and I was in counseling for a while, and it totally
changed my life.  I mean, I really needed that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And now you're going to graduate from college soon and are 
looking toward law school and to a lot of other choices.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Yes.  I am actually considering becoming an adoption 
attorney, because there is so much that I think needs to be changed. 
As we were saying before, there are so many myths about adoption
that people just have this horrific picture of it, and it really
does not have to be that way if you do it right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, Barbara, you are involved in these situations. What 
are you finding as you are dealing with young women making very hard
choices?  What do you find that you need to tell them?
<p>
MS. JONES: You mentioned the counseling. First of all, when I meet 
with a birth mom, generally, they have already matched with a 
prospective adoptive parent, or it might be a situation where they come 
from a crisis pregnancy center, and I will just give them free legal
counsel so they can factor that into the decision-making process,
whether they would actually be able to walk through it, and many
times that assists them in coming to that decision.
<p>
I think counseling is critical.  I have worked with birth moms who have 
been in total denial, told me that they never felt the baby kick, that 
when they went to the hospital, they were expecting maybe their period
was coming. There was such incredible denial, but then here's
the reality of a baby.
<p>
My favorite counselor with birth moms is in fact a trained social worker, 
but she is also a birth mother that placed a child six years ago, and 
she is so effective because she knows the issues of their heart. And 
when a birth mom can be -- if you can walk her through her grieving and 
all the things that she is going to be experiencing, it helps her to do 
the hard thing that she is doing and it gets her over that just really
difficult period and brings her to wholeness and healing again,
gives her hope.
<p>
So counseling is critical.  I think education is critical. Even in the 
legal relationship, working with birth parents, it is far more than just 
the law part, because in many ways you are a friend and you are walking 
them through those different stages.  You come to care very much for 
them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The grieving is something, I think, that people don't talk 
a lot about, even when you are making a decision that it is something 
that you're letting go.  How long did it take you to sort of grieve
and get over that?
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Actually, I can't say that it is something that ever 
really ends.  There comes a point where definitely you don't cry every 
day. It's a loss you have to deal with constantly.  I think, at least 
for me, I can say that it is just something -- I had to accept that this 
was just part of who I am now and part of my life, and you have to move 
beyond the shock of, oh, my gosh, this actually happened to me, or that
I actually did this, and you have to try to look at it as a positive
experience.  I mean, my life is much better, her life is much
better, this family is happier, and you have to just focus on
the positive.
<p>
But there are still moments when I think it is almost surreal, like 
I can't believe I did that, not in a bad way, but just it seems 
unbelievable.  But I think there is always going to be something, like 
it's very hard for me to imagine, when I do get married and have 
children, being happy about being pregnant or something like that. 
There is always going to be something there that I am going to 
associate with having children that will never leave me. It is like 
I will never forget that they exist. They will always be my first two 
children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure, absolutely. What are you finding -- you know, Nicki 
is thinking of, saying now the way to deal with it is to be positive. 
When you are talking to a birth mother, is it helpful to say, &quot;Let's
think of the positives&quot;?  What is helpful?  What have you
found to be helpful when you are there?  Because it is easier
for Nicki now to say, &quot;This is how I deal with it.&quot;
What is helpful when you are there talking with someone who is
considering adoption?
<p>
MS. JONES:  First of all, to let her know that it is her decision and 
no one is going -- we are not going to pressure her. It is also very 
important, I think, to esteem a birth mother, to tell her she is a woman 
of honor, and she is a woman of integrity, to hold her head high, because 
she is bringing life three ways:  to this infant, to her own body, not 
experiencing the ravages of abortion, and she may choose to give the gift 
of life to a family that is waiting.  So I think that is very important.
<p>
Also, the other thing that seems to just really stand out is the
relationship that birth parents establish with adoptive parents,
and sometimes they will tell you that the sweetest part about
adoption is the relationship with the adoptive parents, and some
will say that we're afraid we're going to miss them more than
we'll miss our baby, because we know in time we'll go our own
ways and separate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much for being with us, both of you, and I 
really appreciate the stories that you're telling. When we return, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a clip from CBS's <i>48 Hours</i>, 
which brings into light a whole new perspective on parenting
and who has the right to raise children.  Don't go away.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Coming up, we've got a clip from <i>48 Hours</i> 
which takes a look at homosexual adoption, a very controversial topic.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>

[Clip from CBS <i>48 Hours</i>, February 22, 1996, follows:]
<p>
MALE VOICE:  . . .it really doesn't matter whether they have a father 
there or not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Men and women are not interchangeable puzzle pieces.
<p>
MODERATOR: It matters to Kristi Hamrick and the Washington-based Family
Research Council, a conservative think tank.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  . . .the issue here is not two women who benignly want to 
set up a home; it is people actively seeking to rewrite the world, to 
rewrite the law, to rewrite child development into their own image.
<p>
MODERATOR: The judge who wrote the New York decision said that when it 
comes to the best interests of a child, stability and two parents at
home is more important than sexual orientation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The judge is wrong, because eventually these children are 
going to want to know, why wasn't there a father there for me, why wasn't
there a mother there for me, why do I feel like something is missing
when everybody tells me that I've got everything I need?  Because
they need both.
<p>
[End of 48 Hours clip.]

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> invites you to share in a very special annual Family 
Research Council event, the Washington Briefing.

<p>

The 1996 briefing brought together people from across the nation
to hear from some of the [people] most able to provide insight
into America's politics and the challenges facing today's American
family.  The wide range of briefing speakers, from Congressmen
and Senators to journalists, to individuals engaged in pro-family
battles, provides inside-the-beltway knowledge [to] which we as
the public are not often privy.

<p>

So we hope you'll join us tonight as we present highlights of the 
1996 Washington Briefing.

<p>

To begin, though, let's hear from some of the leading freshmen in the 
House of Representatives.  Congresswoman Sue Myrick of North Carolina,
Congressman David McIntosh of Indiana, and Congressman George
Radanovich of California answer some challenging questions asked
by some of the Washington Briefing attendees.  These are questions
that you may have wanted to ask many times and questions that
you hoped reporters would ask but didn't.

<p>

So we've gone beyond the newscasts and ignored some of the true 
insights that they might uncover as <i>Straight Talk</i> brings 
you Behind the Headlines.

[Segment from Washington Briefing follows:]

<p>

QUESTION:  What can we do to get the truth out, and, number two,
why is it that our side of the story isn't being told, except
through underground mechanisms that some of us hear but nobody
else does?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  Some of us who have been up
there all this year have been fighting this battle since the day
we got there in trying the turn around the way the message is
communicated, what we say, what we do, and tell the truth about
what we're doing.  But we haven't been successful in convincing
the powers-to-be to get it done.  We aren't going to get it through
the national media. We have to pay for everything we get.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RADINOVICH: What we want to leave here is emphasizing 
the fact that we need help in the form of volunteer effort and money in
order to get the message out.  But in addition to that, pray Psalm
37 continuously, because within your sphere of influence, there
is likely to be, I wouldn't say unlimited but an uncharted amount
of time for prayer, and that works.  You sit down and you pray
that prayer about what's going on in this country; you will, on
your knees, turn that election around, and I want to just totally
emphasize that.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

QUESTION: The Speaker was named the Man of the Year, and he 
certainly has had a great deal of energy in the contract, and we 
don't hear much from him anymore.  Does he still have the support 
of the freshman class and the Republicans in Congress, and what 
role is he going to play in this next year?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  Well, he does have support of the class.
I'll just say that.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  Yes, definitely.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  The freshmen are behind him.  There has
been a lot of media that has been trying to divide us and say
that there is a problem within the Republican leadership, and
so forth.  That is not the case.  Newt stepped back to do the
vision thing again, which is the Contract with America idea. 
That's what he is about.  That's what he's best at.  He has turned
leadership duties over to Dick Armey and rest of us who are in
leadership.  We all have liaison responsibilities with particular
bills that are coming on the floor.  That is something that hadn't
happened before.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  You'll see the freshman
class rise up in Newt's defense, and they will continue to try
to attack him, because he has verbalized and stood for the things
we believe in.  He, as Sue mentioned, is very consciously at this
point preparing for the next fall's election, and he realized
that during the Presidential primary it would be difficult for
us to have a lot of leadership coming out of the House of Representatives,
because people would be focused on choosing a nominee for the
party.  But if we laid the groundwork now, we could go forward
once the nominee is chosen or becomes apparent and work towards
this renewed agenda.

<p>

He came back and briefed all of us a few weeks ago after the break 
that this was his plan and how he was doing it, and we all went up to 
him and said, &quot;Let us help in any way possible, because we want 
to support exactly what you're doing there.&quot;

<p>

QUESTION:  This question may sound cynical, but I ask it in all 
sincerity.  You're only freshmen for one session, and this freshman 
class is so great.  How long will it be before your freshman class 
falls into lock-step with the old guard in Washington, and now we've 
got to count on more freshmen?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  I think we probably all want to touch
on that one, but I will just say that we and those of us sitting
up here who are in freshmen leadership per se work very hard to
make sure that doesn't happen.  We kind of serve as each other's
conscience.  We prod each other.  One of the strengths we have
is that we're all willing to take on different issues, and somebody
will honcho a different issue, which is why we've been able to
do a lot, and that's very good.

<p>

But when we got here, we decided [that] together we were a force and 
we had some power, and if we weren't together, we were nothing; 
individually, we can do nothing. So we work very hard to keep us 
together, even when we are not freshmen.  Those of us who come back 
will do the same thing, and we will, hopefully, be able to work with 
the new freshmen coming in to make sure they do the same thing.

<p>

It is very important to us that we keep that mind-set.  We try to 
remind ourselves who we are, where we came from, and why we're here all 
the time.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RADINOVICH:  I think most of the freshmen that
have come in really were remarkable in one thing, and that was
that, as Sue said, they let you know who they were, how they thought,
and what they intended to do.  We did that formally through the
signing of the Contract with America, which was on September 27,
1994, and the election was after that, on November 8, 1994.

<p>

So that is something -- if anything else represents the change
that we bring or the beach head that we have established inside
the beltway, or however you want to put it, [it] is the fact that
we were clearly about who we were so that the voters across this
country who are smart, not dumb, knew exactly what they were getting
when they went to the polls, instead of trying to paint yourself
into something and then coming here and doing something else.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents more from the Family Research Council's 1996 Washington Briefing.
What can we do to help in the fight for pro-family issues?  Former
Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, a leading Democrat, shares
his ideas after this break. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. Former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey began our
1996 Washington Briefing, taking on the pro-life debate from a
unique perspective.  Let's hear what Governor Casey has to say
as we share with you FRC's 1996 Washington Briefing.

<p>

GOVERNOR CASEY: When I was governor of Pennsylvania, and I finished 
my service there in January of 1995, I saw first hand the root cause
of most of the social dislocation in our country, and that, of
course, as you well know and as this organization has championed,
the dislocation flows from the disintegration of the American
family.  Unless we try to reconstitute, as all of you know so
well, try to reconstitute that institution called the American
family, America will continue in a downward spiral.

<p>

Now, that is not being apocalyptic; I think that is being quite accurate
in terms of where we are in America today.  And I would say, if
one thing has become crystal clear in 1996 in the debate thus
far in the Presidential sweepstakes in America, it is, from where
I sit at least, not just the economy; it is also the culture.
And those candidates out there with a single-track message, who
talk only about the economy, don't seem to last too long.  It's
not that people are not interested.  Of course, we're interested,
and people want to know where America is going and where the candidates
out there today propose to lead us.

<p>

I would like to suggest two directions today, not exclusive by any 
means but important.  Number one, I think we've got to make adoption a 
number one national priority in the United States of America.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And I want to tell you why.  I ran a major state, no different from 
New York, California, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, you name it.  Thousands
of kids trapped in the foster care system; cost $10 billion, with
a B, $10 billion a year.  And all of the federal incentives, the
reimbursement systems, are in the direction of keeping those kids
in foster care, and they stay there too long, and when they leave,
they wind up too often either in the penitentiary or in the cemetery.

<p>

And why can't both parties stand up say, We disagree on a lot
of things, but there's one thing we can agree on, and that is
the most cost-effective, compassionate, effective alternative
for children in America today who find themselves trapped in foster
care is to make it easier for the adoption process to work, on
both the public side and the private side, so that the disincentives
in our federal reimbursement system are reversed in favor of urging
and giving incentives to states to take children out of foster
care and put them into adoptive homes where they will have a real
chance to be decent and law-abiding and happy and productive citizens.
Aggressive advocacy of adoption, I think, begins the process
of reconstituting the American family.

<p>

In my state of Pennsylvania in 1987, we joined with a group called One 
Church/One Child run by the Black Ministerium.  It began in Chicago and 
came to Pennsylvania. We teamed up with them at the state level, and 
over the next seven years, we placed 800 children, African-American 
children, in adoptive homes.  We began a new statewide initiative to 
press for adoption, to make it a top priority. We can do it and have to 
do it, it seems to me, at the national level.

<p>

Let me move now to a second proposal, and that is one with which 
you are very familiar:  Is America going to provide legal protection 
for the child or not? And how long do we have to wait?  We've waited 23 
years.  Another 25 years?  When is this debate engaged?  If not now, 
when, and if not you, us, well, then who?

<p>

Let me tell you what I am talking about.  We have an ideal opportunity 
right now, at a time of great spiritual and cultural renewal in this 
country, symbolized, I would submit to you, by the tremendous impact 
this organization and Gary Bauer and all of you have had in shaping 
public opinion in America.  I would commend to your reading this article 
here that I've brought with me today in the <i>Women's Quarterly</i>. 
It is written by a feminist, or at least a pro-choice person, whose
name is Candace C. Crandall.  It just came out.

<p>

She explains in this article why the pro-choice movement is suddenly 
playing defense. The title is -- you'll excuse me -- but &quot;The Fetus 
Beat Us.&quot; You see, we're winning this battle.  We're really winning
this battle.  It seems that too few of our own people realize
that we're winning this battle.

<p>

Look at some of the signs. The First Lady tells us abortion is wrong. 
<i>Newsweek</i> magazine. Kate Michaelman said that abortion is a 
&quot;bad thing,&quot; her words.  Henry Foster says that the 
abortion is a &quot;failure,&quot; his word, which he abhors. And 
Susan Estrich(?), who ran Mr. Dukakis' campaign, said, &quot;We're 
winning in the courts&quot; -- that is, the pro-choice side -- 
&quot;but losing in the streets.&quot;

<p>

Now, all of these signs and trends have made their demands on
the political system, and so in 1994, the Republican resurgence
in the Congress -- you've heard Mr. Steeper's(?) analysis of the
1994 returns when the number of people who voted for the Republican
Party in the congressional elections zoomed, catapulted, exploded,
from 27 million in 1990 to 36 million in 1994.

<p>

The Freedom of Choice Act went down the tubes, never got out of 
committee.  Medical schools aren't teaching young doctors about abortion 
anymore. Over 80 percent of the counties in America don't have abortion
clinics 23 years after <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. In 1994, pro-life 
congressional candidates won, by and large, and pro-choice candidates 
lost, by and large.

<p>

Two conclusions follow, from where I sit, from all
of this.  One, cultural issues are central to the emergence of
the Republican Party in the Congress of the United States, just
as they are, in my judgment, to the demise -- some would say the
disintegration -- of the Democratic Party at the national level.

<p>

The <i>New York Times</i> had a front-page story about two months ago
talking about the Democrats and the defections across the United
States at all levels, not just retirements in the Senate and the
Congress; in state legislatures, in local government all across
America.  I think this concern I am talking about here today is
what fundamentally drives that demise, because how can the party
which came into being and which prided itself on leaving no one
out and no one behind, prided itself on the protection of the
powerless, how can it write off -- since when did America write
off -- an entire class of people, especially the most vulnerable
of all, and say, &quot;There's nothing we can do.  The children
must die&quot;?

<p>

That's not America.  That's not who we are. That's not our American 
experience.  We've never accepted that before, except in one case in 
the 1860s when the Supreme Court said that African-Americans are 
non-persons; they have no rights. That mistake was corrected. The 
mistake of <i>Roe v. Wade</i> remains to be corrected. But it will 
be corrected, and it will be corrected, in my judgment, in our 
lifetime if we make this case and make it consistently and make it 
with passion and make it, if you'll excuse me, with a sense of outrage 
and say to the people of this country, &quot;What are they doing to 
America, when we have lost 30 million?&quot;

<p>

And what do we have to show for it? Are women more liberated or more 
free?  I ask you, when is a woman more free, when she is giving life 
or when she is taking it? And is America's true character to be found 
in an abortion clinic or in an adoptive home?  What is consistent 
with the essential goodness and decency of the American people?

<p>

I think our people understand that, and if we present it to them 
as a natural outgrowth of the American experience, of expanding the 
circle of the commonly protected and making the Declaration of 
Independence not just words on a page but words to live by, we're 
going to prevail, because I firmly believe that abortion is destined 
for the scrap heap of history. I believe that we've got to continue 
to speak for the child. And if we do, I believe this country will 
realize the potential that Jefferson had in mind when he said that 
these rights, the most important of which is the right to life, 
these rights come not from the state, not from the Congress, not 
from the Supreme Court, not from the state legislature, but from 
the hand of God.

<p>

That's the challenge that I leave with all of us here today.
Thank you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Please join us after the commercial break as we 
continue our 1996 Washington Briefing highlights with Rabbi 
Daniel Lapin.  You won't want to miss it.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  Rabbi Daniel Lapin is a strong advocate
of the preservation of America's families through Judeo-Christian-based
conservative values.  Rabbi Lapin has influenced many with his
commentaries on the socioeconomic trends that have shaped this
country.  Let's hear what he had to say to FRC's Washington Briefing
attendees.

<p>

RABBI LAPIN: There are two different views of America
today.  There is the view held by the Boy Scouts of America, by
Family Research Council, and by so many other Americans, actually
a majority of Americans, who still remember that it is duty, it
is faith, it is intellect.  It's doing what we know to be right,
not what we feel like doing.  And feelings, while very important,
come second.

<p>

Let us take a look for a moment at two organs that
the good Lord has provided us with.  He has provided us with eyes
and ears.  Let's ask ourselves for a moment which of those two,
eyes and ears, is the avenue to the emotions and which one is
the avenue to the mind and the intellect.  Think for a moment.

<p>

Gentlemen -- this is a quiz just for the gentlemen -- have you
or any other male whom you know, at the present or at any time
in the past, ever become involved with a woman in an utterly unsuitable
relationship that was destructive, painful, and going absolutely
nowhere?

<p>

[Laughter.]

You do not have to raise your hands for this one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I will take the answer as a yes from virtually all of us. When that 
happened to this man we all know, when this happened, was it because 
of the way the woman looked, or was it because of the way the woman 
spoke over the phone? Eyes and ears stand clearly for an emotional 
dominance versus an intellectual or obligation/faith/duty-driven view 
of the world.

<p>

While America was driven by words and by the ear, we were a nation 
that was capable of weighing things out, looking at the long term, 
being careful about things.  But as soon as we turned into a nation
that gets most of its information through the eyes, look what
happens.  Everything changes, and we are now -- every single debate
today is framed in emotional terms, everything.

<p>

What about the children?  Hillary Clinton made an entire industry, with 
her friends, out of the children, because that is a wonderfully 
emotional picture, and nobody stops to think that children shouldn't be 
Hillary Clinton's problem; it should be their parents' problem.  And if 
she wants to help children, she should help the parents, not the children.
We don't need a direct line from the government to our children.
We want that line to go through us.

<p>

We don't need schools where teachers are told, &quot;Be certain that 
your children are encouraged not to tell their parents about this 
part of the program.&quot; That is what children are taught in 
public school today:  &quot;Don't tell your parents about this. 
They won't understand.&quot;  We don't need that. But in an 
emotionally driven society, it is very difficult to deal with that.

<p>

Now, emotional is short term. It's now.  I've got to do something 
about it.  There's somebody starving. There's somebody hungry. 
There's somebody out there who needs help.  And there is no cause to 
ask oneself, what is the long-term impact?  And this is why it is that 
otherwise well-intentioned people, intelligent people, even 
intellectual people, would go for the welfare system as it is, 
because it is only reasonable if you bring up onto my screen a 
wretched, miserable, suffering human being. Ladies and gentlemen, 
is there anybody in this room who wouldn't feel driven by compassion? 

<p>

But don't do that to me.  I resent it.  You are robbing me of an 
opportunity to weigh it up intellectually. I don't want the picture of 
the starving person in front of me while I weigh this up.  I want to be 
able to think clearly for a few minutes and evaluate what is the most
effective way to help this problem long term.  But as long as
you are wrenching at my emotions, I can't do anything about this.

<p>

And that's why it is, in the book of Numbers, chapter 15, &quot;And
you should not stray after your hearts and after your eyes.&quot;
Heart, if you think about it, heart is a metaphor for the emotions.
Don't stray, says Numbers chapter 15, don't stray after your
heart and don't stray after your eyes.  You must have a heart,
and you must enjoy your eyes, but that's not a way to make decisions.

<p>

And that is what is happening.  The Peter Jenningses and the Dan
Rathers of the world are emotionally driven; they are visually
driven.  And the consequence is [that it is] very difficult to
maintain stable structures in society, because emotions are short
term; intellect and duty are long term.

<p>

This is why it is that Washington, D.C., is absolutely filled with the 
most wonderful single women, who truly desire to be married and to 
raise families, and it is tough to find guys that are man enough for the 
job, because we have been turned into an emotionally driven society,
not an intellectually driven one, and emotional is short term.
Short term, there are no benefits in marriage, particularly with
the wonders of the sex revolution that says that premarital sex
is just fine.

<p>

You have now eliminated the last possible, conceivable
-- well, that is perhaps not a good choice of word -- the last
possible reason why any man driven by short-term emotionalism
should ever contemplate marriage.  It's not possible.  Only with
the long-term view is that possible.

<p>

Now, what is the counter? If, indeed, we have become a society driven 
by the eye, driven by emotionalism, driven by the short term, that that 
is the final argument -- listen to our politicians sometimes; listen 
to public speakers.  You provide an emotional reason, and that's it. 
Everybody's satisfied.  That's the end of it.  It's non-refutable. You 
can't do anything about it.

<p>

This very hotel is running a campaign to add onto your bill for 
UNICEF, and there are pictures of children in need. It's tough. But 
you know something?  I'm not going to do it, because I am not 
convinced that the United Nations best knows how to make sure that 
that money goes into the tummy of a starving child instead of into 
that of a bloated bureaucrat.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And so there needs to be a restoration of the intellectual
faith aspect of life.  We've got to rebuild that, and I have two
very specific recommendations for you, two very specific recommendations,
recommendations that you can carry out with you to your families,
to your friends, to your neighborhoods, and above all convey these
ideas, if you would.  Tell them your rabbi sent you.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Convey these ideas as a proud religious conservative.  Let's come
out of the closet.  It seems everyone else has.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

There's nothing wrong with saying, &quot;I am a religious conservative,
and it is my religious belief that fuels my ideas,&quot; because
politics, ladies and gentlemen, is wonderful.  Politics is what
enables us to live with one another in spite of differences without
resorting to guns and fists.  We can talk our differences through.
And politics is nothing but applied values, and we must be proud
to say where our values come from, because there is no other way
to combat the drive of the heart which we should not follow, the
drive of the eyes which we should not follow.

<p>

And so my specific two recommendations are:  number one, reduce your 
TV watching by at least half an hour a day.  Now, just to give you the 
figures here, ladies and gentlemen, I have done this calculation over
and over and over again.  I can't believe it myself, but believe
me, it is true.  If you methodically cut out half an hour a day
of television watching, which I am sure every one of us can do,
you gain, over the next decade, six months of productive time.
Six months. Do you know what you and I could do with six months
of productive waking time?  That is the time that half an hour
a day of television will buy you.

<p>

But it buys you something much more urgent than that, and that 
is a reduction in your visual input, and it gives you an opportunity 
to get a little bit more verbal input, which is more balanced. How 
do you do that?  Practice conversation. Encourage people -- do you 
know that there are Americans that have the television on during 
family dinner? Don't do it. It's terrible.

<p>

Those are my two suggestions:  half an hour less television a day 
and only conversation when the family is together. It's going to 
be very tough, because a society that has overwhelmed itself with 
emotionalism and with imagery and with eye-driven content is going 
to find it very difficult to converse. Have you noticed that? People 
are awkward when there's nothing on and we are reduced to nothing 
but conversation.  We have lost the art, and it can come back.

<p>

And, fortunately, we have such a ready source of material to bring 
it back, and that's the Bible. There is something to talk about. 
There is something to talk about, and there is a way of latching 
onto any aspect of events of the day and using the time to analyze them 
from an intellectual point of view with no pictures.  Expose your children
to that.  Encourage other people to do the same.  It's a wonderfully
exciting experience.  But apart from the pleasure it brings, it
reduces the visual input, which makes the participants that much
less an emotional crowd.

<p>

And, ladies and gentlemen, I believe, as these crashing waves of 
cultural chaos threaten to engulf the very civilization that has bred 
us, it is only going to be a traditional Judeo-Christian vision of 
society, made possible by all of you here today, that is going to 
restore the health of our great country. And it will. It will because 
we are at the very beginning of America's third great religious 
reawakening.

<p>

The first one, in the early 18th century, brought about American 
independence. The second one, in the 1800s, laid the groundwork for 
the abolition of slavery.  And the third one, ladies and gentlemen, 
that we are right in the middle of right now is the one that is going
to restore the moral, cultural, and economic health of our blessed
land.  Tell them your rabbi said so.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will share more 
of the 1996 Washington Briefing as we hear from Oklahoma Senator Don 
Nickles.  He shares some exciting changes he hopes to accomplish in 
the upcoming months. Please join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. The 1996 Washington Briefing allowed us to hear 
from those in government who are ardently fighting for America's 
families.

<p>

Senator Don Nickles is a real leader.  We now share with you 
his perspectives on current issues pending on the Senate floor and
how those issues affect you and your family.

<p>

SENATOR NICKLES: I want to talk to you about a whole bunch of issues 
that are kind of pending, and I will go kind of fast and talk about 
those and encourage your involvement and encourage your input, because
a lot of these are very important to families, one of which, I
am just going to say, is one of our biggest items.

<p>

Many of us believe very strongly in balancing the budget, and we believe
we should not spend more than we take, and you say, &quot;Why?&quot;
Well, that is economic policy and that is prudent and that is
fiscal.  I will tell you, I think it is vitally important for
our kids.  I don't think it is morally responsible to be leaving
our children with decades and billions and now trillions of dollars
of unfunded debt that we have put on their shoulders.  So I think
it is high time -- well past time, frankly -- for us to balance
the budget and quit laying more additional debt on our children.
That is what the fight is for.  It is, are we going to morally
responsible?

<p>

We live in the greatest and the freest county in the history of 
mankind. That is a real blessing. God has blessed us. But we see a 
lot of challenges and in some cases some actions
that are taken either by President Clinton or maybe by Congress
that infringe on our freedom.  Maybe it is excessive debt.  Maybe
it is policies that are coming down from the administration that
really infringe on what I would call a family-friendly environment.
And when we see that, I think we have a real obligation to stand
up and say, &quot;Wait a minute.  That's wrong.&quot;

<p>

You know, it is not just fiscal issues.  I will just give you an 
example: welfare. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed two welfare
reform bills.  He campaigned that we need to end welfare as we
know it, and he always got applause.  I was one that was applauding.
We need to.  We have 334 federally defined welfare programs,
means-tested welfare programs:  if you meet this criteria, you
get the benefit.

<p>

We don't think that makes a lot of sense. A lot of us say, &quot;Wait 
a minute.&quot;  These government welfare programs are well 
intentioned; good intentions.  I don't fault the intentions of the 
authors of the proposals.  But what you have is program stacked on 
program on top of other programs, and the net result is that we have 
created a welfare dependency cycle where people are looking to 
government as their sole source of solutions to problems instead of 
to families, instead of to communities. Instead of developing an 
interest in trying to climb that economic ladder, they say, 
&quot;Give me a handout.&quot;  We have almost created a generational 
welfare dependency cycle.

<p>

We are going to have a debate before too long on minimum wage.  I am 
going to oppose their efforts.  And you say, &quot;Well, why?&quot;
Hey, I used to make minimum wage.  My wife and I have been married
now 27 years; she has still put up with me.  Our first jobs, we
both made minimum wage.  And, frankly, it wasn't enough.  President
Clinton and others say, &quot;Oh, no, we think it should be against
the law for you to have a job unless you pay such-and-such,&quot;
and therefore pricing some jobs out.  Maybe it is that janitor
service, maybe it is pumping gas, maybe it is sacking groceries.

<p>

But that might be that 16-year-old in Chicago that has some
open time during the summer, and so if he can't get a job, what
is he going to do?  And a lot of times people end up in the wrong
environment.  Instead of doing something good and positive, maybe
a job, and saying, &quot;Hey, this job doesn't pay enough, I need
to learn more, I need to get a better education, I need better
training so I can get a better job,&quot; they end up involved
in drugs or in crime, and so on.  And so to me that is an important
issue.

<p>

It is an important issue when we talk about crime. Unfortunately,
I notice President Clinton has got maybe an election year conversion.
He is starting to talk about his war on the drugs.  We just did
two papers talking about Clinton's about-face on the war on drugs.
He is now going to increase funding for the Office of National
Drug Control Policy.  What he didn't tell you [was] that in 1993
he reduced the office from 146 employees to 25.  What he didn't
tell you [was] he cut the office by over 80 percent in 1993; he
totally gutted the office.

<p>

When you talk about family values, it is interesting. You remember 
the Clintonites just ridiculed Vice President Quayle when he started 
talking about family values. Let me tell you something. Dan Quayle 
was right, and welcome aboard the Clintonites and others when you 
start talking about family values.  Family values are important.

<p>

I urge you to get involved.  I urge you to get involved in these 
campaigns, whether for House members or for Senators or for the 
President of the United States.  It is critically important, and it 
is not just so you can elect more Republicans.  I am a partisan 
Republican. I am chairman of the Policy Committee, and so on.

<p>

Find out where people stand on issues.  I will be very comfortable if 
this group will go out and find out where people stand on issues, 
regardless of party.  I will be very comfortable with whoever you support.
You find people that have character, people that believe in family
values, people that really think as you do on a lot of these issues,
whether you are talking about abortion, whether you are talking
about gays in the military, whether you are talking about who
should be surgeon general, who should be appointed to the Supreme
Court.

<p>

These are awfully important issues.  These are issues
of life and death.  These are issues that deal with the future
of our kids and our grandkids, so they can come back and say,
&quot;Yes, we really do thank God for the fact that we live in
the United States of America, because it is still the greatest
and the freest country in the history of mankind.&quot;

<p>

Thank you very much. God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> gives you a look 
at issues being battled by our very own Family Research Council staff. 
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The Family Research 
Council staff works diligently to positively shape issues affecting 
today's families, from pro-life issues to cyberporn to gay marriage. 

<p>

FRC briefing attendees wanted to know some specifics on those issues, 
so they asked our staff. Let's hear those questions and answers on 
tonight's Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

STAFF MEMBER: It would seem like to me -- and I guess this is to Bob 
Knight and Bob Maginnis -- that a President that has pushed the 
homosexual issue as strongly as he has, that in itself would be enough 
to defeat a President, and I wonder why we haven't been stronger
on that, to use that against him.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  One problem is you don't see too many opposition 
figures out there in front on this issue, frankly.  It's a hard sell 
for us in Washington to persuade people to take it on, even though it 
is a clear winner with the American people.

<p>

Right now the Republican nominee will have a terrific opportunity 
to delineate the differences between the two parties should he 
choose to do so, and that is by taking up the gay marriage issue. That 
is going to be a monumental issue in this country during this year, 
during this election year.

<p>

You have to ask yourself how many politicians would want to be in
the position of voting against laws that uphold traditional marriage
during an election year.  I mean, this is a gift to anybody who
wants to take it up, and yet we frankly have been meeting opposition.

<p>

We are hoping that will change this year, because the marriage
issue is a winner.  The polls show that 71 percent of the people
in the state of Hawaii are against gay marriage, liberal Hawaii.
Polls show similar figures for the nation as a whole.  And given
that this is after about 10 years of mainstream media propaganda
about homosexuality with almost no answering except the work we
have done and some other groups, once the issue is joined and
the facts are out on the table, I can only imagine that those
figures will rise.

<p>

So the real problem is we need some leadership in the political 
realm to take up the cause that we know all Americans would 
respond to.

<p>

COL. MAGINNIS:  It has only been the Family Research Council -- and 
I can say that without any reservation -- that has really led the 
charge on this issue, that has held the fort.  We have been in the 
courts, and we are the only organization in the courts in this 
country battling the issue of homosexuals in the military.

<p>

One of these cases, probably the <i>Thomasson</i> or the 
<i>Abel</i>(?) case, will go to the Supreme Court this fall, and
we will have a decision this time next year which will tell us
what the Supreme Court thinks about this issue.  What the Supreme
Court tells us about this issue will have just about as much significance
as what they tell us about the Second Amendment out in Colorado.
Probably it is going to have a lot to do with some of what Bob
just outlined in regard to single-gender marriage, because they
cite all these military cases as evidence that there is no problem
with this.

<p>

I will tell you that the people on the Hill -- and
I have talked to a lot of them on this issue -- they run from
it because they are afraid of it.  People in the military -- I
talked to the chief of staff of the Army and to most of the senior
leadership.  They ran from it.  There are only a few people that
are willing to stand up and tell the truth.

<p>

STAFF MEMBER: I just wonder what is being done to get pornography off 
of the Internet.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Just in January, as part of the large Telecommunications
Reform Act of 1996, we had the Communications Decency Act, which
is specifically designed to deal with the accessibility of pornography
on the Internet.  So that was passed, and that was a huge victory
for us.  We worked for a long time on that, with other groups
as well.

<p>

Immediately after President Clinton signed the act, though,
the ACLU filed suit against the Communications Decency Act, saying
it was unconstitutional, and I am traveling to Philadelphia at
the end of this week for the trial in that case.

<p>

The ACLU thinks it is unconstitutional because they think any 
restriction on anything that can remotely be called speech or expression 
is unconstitutional. They are wrong, and they usually lose, and we 
expect that they will lose in this case, too.

<p>

What the CDA does is says that mild pornography, which adults have a 
constitutional right to get -- we don't like that, but that is the state 
of the law -- cannot be given to children, and that is on firm legal 
grounds. So the CDA is well within constitutional precedent, and we 
think it is going to be upheld.

<p>

Does that mean that there will be no pornography on the Internet? 
No, that is not what that means, because pornography laws are broken 
every day.  But the fact is, there will be ground rules, and there 
will be a law that a prosecutor can use to prosecute people who violate 
this new law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares more of our annual Family Research Council's Washington Briefing. 
The 1996 briefing included nationally known speakers who informed FRC 
constituents about the most current and controversial events.  Key among 
the speakers were leading Senators and Congressmen detailing issues
affecting America's families.

<p>

The FRC Washington Briefing was also a wonderful reminder that the 
pro-family battle is not exclusively fought inside the beltway. Leaders 
from across our nation maintain the standards that ensure family values 
are not lost in today's societies. You will enjoy this exchange of 
national and front-line leaders in this briefing highlight.

<p>

But to begin, let's hear Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum's insight 
into what actually happens on the House and Senate floors.  For you 
C-SPAN junkies, the congressional voting process may seem routine, 
but for many the congressional language sounds foreign.  So Senator 
Rick Santorum provides a clear definition of that language and what 
changes need to be made so that our representatives can efficiently 
and effectively make positive decisions for American citizens.

<p>

To learn more, <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

[Segment from 1996 Washington Briefing follows:]

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM:  What makes the Senate slower than
the House?  It is called a filibuster.  I was in the House four
years; I have been in the Senate now a year and two months, although
it seems like I have been in the Senate four years, because we
just spend that much more time on the floor in debate and deliberation.

<p>

In the House, majority rules.  If you have 51 percent of the vote,
you can do anything you want in the House of Representatives,
anything.  You have something called a Rules Committee in the
House, which, every time a bill comes to the floor of the House,
there is a rule that comes with it that limits debate and limits
amendments.  If you want to offer an amendment on the floor of
the House, by and large, you have to get permission from the Rules
Committee to do so.  And if you don't get permission, you can't
offer the amendment.

<p>

So it is very much a majority-ruled and controlled
body.  The Rules Committee has nine Republicans and four Democrats.
So even if we lose one or two of our own, we still win.  So it
is very hard for the leader -- and the leader puts people who
are going to follow the leader on the Rules Committee.  So you
really have absolute control over it.

<p>

In the Senate, every bill that comes up, you can offer an amendment, 
whether it is germane or not germane.  We can be debating 
telecommunications, and we can have an amendment that deals with the 
Bosnian war; just no relevance at all.  And they can continue to offer 
it. Every day they can offer the same amendment.  Every bill that comes 
up, we can deal with the same amendment.  Many times we do deal with
a lot of the same.  Senator Wellstone has one of his favorite
amendments.  He offers it all the time.  We voted on it 10, 12
times.  But that can happen in the Senate.

<p>

Also, we have to have 60 votes to pass a bill.  Now, it only takes 51 
to pass, but to get to the passage, get to the vote on final passage, 
you usually have to break, at least in this Congress, we usually have 
to break a filibuster, which means we need 60 votes.  So we have to 
have 60 votes to get to passage, which really means you need 60 votes
to pass a bill, and you have this unlimited amendment which will
delay things for a long, long, long time.  So that is the problem.

<p>

The solution is actually a very simple solution, and that is get
60 Republican Senators.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents more from the Family Research Council's
1996 Washington Briefing, as we hear how we can make a difference
in reforming our current welfare system.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. At the 1996 Washington Briefing, Senator Dan
Coats spoke of hope and vision for truly impacting Americans who
are in need.  Let's hear how we can help transform lives and revive
our communities.

<p>

SENATOR COATS:  Something that has just been a passion of mine and 
something that I have been working on for nearly a decade is an issue 
that addresses not necessarily the political side of the question but 
the moral and spiritual side of the question.

<p>

I am encouraged from the standpoint that America today is talking 
about not only the failure of big government to address our problems 
but beginning to seriously examine the moral and spiritual and 
cultural decline that is taking place in this nation and beginning 
to ask questions about how we can revive the role of the family, 
the role of the church, the role of the spiritual involvement and 
values in terms of education, in terms of who we are as a people.

<p>

We are beginning to read in what normally would be considered liberal 
publications, we are beginning to hear from people who normally would 
be labeled as coming more from the liberal side, that the failure of 
the secular approach, the big government approach, must lead us to an 
examination of whether or not we can identify other successful 
approaches; and I am encouraged that that debate has begun.

<p>

Ten years ago, as the Republican leader of the Children, Youth, and 
Families Committee in the House of Representatives, I began, along with
some others, to look at the role of the government in addressing
some of these fundamental needs that exist in our society today.

<p>

That committee, in its first year of existence, traveled around
the country attempting to elicit from individuals speaking before
our panel identification of the problem and solutions to the problem.
And everywhere we went, it seemed that no matter who came before
us to propose the solutions, the bottom line of what they proposed
was more of the same.  &quot;Oh, this program could be effective
if we had some more funds to enlarge it, to broaden it, to reach
out.  No, we don't have positive statistics to give you right
now in terms of outcome, but if we could put more money into the
program, if we could put more effort -- and, by the way, we don't
have the money here, so you need to send it from Washington&quot;
-- everywhere we went in the country, no matter whom we talked
to -- rural, suburban, inner city, or whatever -- all the experts
came before us and said more of the same.

<p>

It was at one of our last hearings in Macon, Georgia, on the subject 
of the rural southern youth and the problems that they were 
experiencing, that the very last panelist to appear before our 
committee before we rushed back to Atlanta to get on a plane to come 
back to Washington was a humble black minister from the Macedonian 
Missionary Church of Waycross, Georgia.  I don't know how he got on 
the panel. I don't know who invited him.  I didn't know why he was 
there.

<p>

Rev. McKinney, as some of the members and staff were starting
to pack up their papers to get ready to go back to Atlanta, presented
some of the most eloquent testimony that hit the nail right on
the head.  He looked at us and said, &quot;I've been listening
all day, and what you Congressmen and women don't seem to understand
is that the problems that I have to deal with with the youth of
my area, mostly low income, mostly black, that's true,&quot; he
said, &quot;but the problems I deal with are the same as the problems
everywhere.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;Those problems don't just result
from a lack of good housing, from a lack of good programs, from
a lack of schools, lack of education.&quot;  He said, &quot;Those
problems go deeper than that.  What you Congressmen don't seem
to understand is that if we want to heal individuals, we have
to touch the whole person.&quot;  He said, &quot;Government can't
do that.  You see,&quot; he said, &quot;all of us are made up
of not just body and mind but soul and spirit, and if we can't
redeem and heal soul and spirit, no matter how much money you
pour into programs, no matter how many bureaucracies you establish,
no matter how many programs you send to us,&quot; he said, &quot;all
the money in the world will not solve the problems of these people,
because we have to heal their soul and spirit as well as address
the problems of body and mind.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;These young girls that come to me with child, no 
father taking responsibility,&quot; he said, &quot;they're looking 
for something to love.  They are looking for something that is much 
deeper than can be solved by a government program.  And these young 
black boys that come that have been fathering kids all over the 
community, they're looking for something to prove that they are a 
man.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;That is why you must begin to examine how we can utilize 
the role of the church, the role of the family, the role of charity and 
private organizations outside of government which can bring these 
spiritual values to bear on a spiritual problem.&quot;

<p>

From that point forward, I began the process of attempting to identify 
ways in which the government could shift its emphasis from government 
programs which can't address soul and spirit to programs that can address 
soul and spirit.  I realize that you have to get beyond government.
We have to find a way to utilize institutions that are not government
institutions so that those institutions can bring to bear the
spiritual content and effort that can truly make a difference
in lives that are hurting, that can reclaim lives and redeem lives.

<p>

I have examined programs across the country that are reaching
out and solving intractable problems by injecting a spiritual
renewal and a vision of hope and redemption in the people that
they reach out to.

<p>

All of that led to the culmination and development
of a program called Project for American Renewal that I have worked
on intensely for the past year and a half, pulling together a
number of ways in which the government can begin the process of
shifting from the public sector to the private sector, ways which
do not violate the Constitution in terms of government involvement,
but energizing those organizations and those entities, those institutions
that can truly reclaim our communities, pull families back together,
reclaim lives, and bring spiritual and moral values to the programs
that they engage in.

<p>

Heart and soul of it all, though, is a charity
tax credit which allows every taxpayer in America to make a choice.
You can send up to $1,000 of your taxes that are due to the Federal
Government, or if you have more confidence in your local church
program or your local charity or your local faith-based organization,
you can designate that $1,000 to that organization and offset
it against those taxes due.

<p>

The bottom line: provide a hope and a vision for renewal of American 
society, for bringing families back together, for reuniting communities, 
for involving faith-based charities and involving the church in ways 
that provide redeeming, life-transforming, real help to people that 
are in need.

<p>

I think our party needs that vision.  I think we need to 
stand for more than just simply more of the same.  We don't know what 
to do except pour more money into the Washington institutions or simply 
wash our hands of the problem and say, &quot;Well, we just hope it
works itself out.  Government can't do it, but we don't know who
can.&quot;

<p>

We know who can.  We know who brings the hope of change,
the hope of redemption, the hope that touches soul and spirit
as well as body and mind.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Please join us after the commercial break as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> continues our 1996 Family Research Council Washington Briefing 
highlights.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Washington State has a lot to be proud of in electing Congresswoman 
Linda Smith.  As a freshman, she has taken an extremely unpopular 
stance on making radical but, many believe, needed changes to 
government as we know it.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE SMITH: In this envelope are all the invitations of the 
nighttime events I could go to.  I can go to a Rock the House if I am 
a lobbyist and want to pay $500.  And I can go to a California Fiesta.
This is just the events I could go to each night from about 5
to 10 o'clock instead of reading the bills.

<p>

So when I got here and I got these, I go, &quot;Now, ooh, I didn't 
bargain for that.&quot; Of course, as a two-week write-in candidate, 
I didn't bargain for much of anything.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I am not a Republican first, though. I know where my source is. And 
so when I got to Congress as a write-in candidate, I looked at the 
place, I looked at those invitations that I got each night, and I 
couldn't do it.

<p>

The first invitation, I looked and here were the names of the 
committees on it, and at the bottom it said, &quot;PACs, $500.&quot; 
I picked up the next one.  It said, &quot;PACs, $1,000.&quot;  And 
then I went into training, and I found out I was expected to spend
three to five nights a week, three to five hours a night, going
to these events to raise money for my colleagues, and they would
do it for me, and the invitations were sent to the PACs and special-interest
groups that surround this place.

<p>

I decided I wouldn't do it for a very functional reason.  I didn't have 
three to five hours a day.  I hadn't run.  God had put me here.  Some 
people have spent two years, but I spent two weeks. And while I was 
here, I was going to get the job done, really kind of basic stuff.

<p>

But I went to a couple of receptions, and I realized not only could I 
not do that; I couldn't go.  Now, I am not holier than thou.  I have
run a corporation; I have been in the business community for years;
I have been in politics.  I am not a neophyte to this.  But the
first time one of the lobbyists came up to me and leaned towards
me and said, &quot;I was a friend in your last election,&quot;
I realized we had two languages, the language out in the real
world and here.

<p>

What that means is he had given me money into
my election, and he went right on to say, after he said, &quot;I
was a friend in your last election&quot; -- that means I gave
you a contribution; that's the translation -- he went on to tell
me what they wanted that was right on the floor right then. And
I go, &quot;Oh, this is really close.&quot;

<p>

Then I realized that what was happening is there are fund-raisers all 
around every night, Democrat and Republican, probably a dozen or more 
every night.  That's where the lobbyists go.  They pay to get in, $500
to $1,000, for members for their war chests -- that means money
you accumulate from special interests to make sure nobody runs
against you -- and that that was just an atmosphere where they
could come and find a certain number of members every night to
lobby the bill on the floor.  We were in session just about every
night, and we ran back and forth between these events and voted
and went back and forth.

<p>

I watched what was happening to these families, and I am not saying 
that they are all breaking up, but it will be amazing if they don't. 
Here was dad at these receptions every night, or mom, mostly dads, 
three to five nights a week, with everyone telling you you're wonderful 
-- of course, they want something -- giving you money, and then these 
families were having to figure out how to get home on the weekends, and 
if they got home on the weekends, how they were spreading their time 
between their family and their district, or moving their family here and
then having to choose between the district or the family here.
Bad situation.

<p>

I looked at this and thought, Now, why did God
put me here?  I don't believe God makes mistakes.  I was so overwhelmed
by it, and I don't mean losing control, I mean just I can't believe
this place operates this way.  I started looking and going, &quot;Why?
Why, with good people coming here, does it happen?&quot;

<p>

This is the way it happens, and I figured it out.  It's a trap.  Good
people get here.  They stay good, but they have to harden a little
bit to stay in it.  Now, some folks say, &quot;That's not fair,
Linda; it doesn't affect me.&quot;  I'll give them that.  Maybe
a few people it doesn't affect. But as soon as they get here,
this is what happens.  They arrange one of those events for you.
On it they put the committees that you are on; in fact, they
put the freshmen on key committees to raise money.  They then
call on the name of the chair and the committee, and they will
do this if you're a lobbyist, and they have your staff doing it
at night, and you pay people to do it, and volunteers do it.

<p>

Let's say that you're a lobbyist.  They will call you and they will
say, &quot;Hi.  I'm calling tonight.  I didn't see your name on
Linda Smith's event tomorrow night,&quot; the fiesta, California
Fiesta or whatever.  They make it sound like a party.  Who pays
$500 to go to that kind of party?  And then they pause.  I mean,
it is all scripted.  &quot;Well, are you coming?&quot;  They say
something about being busy.  &quot;Well, have you sent your check?&quot;

<p>

Now, this is just the way it goes, and not occasionally; that
is the scripting.  Tell me it's not affecting this place.  It
is affecting this place.  And even if you somehow in your heart
can feel it doesn't affect you, it does affect this place.

<p>

So when I decided that we couldn't do that, I started accumulating
all the invitations, and I realized that the committees are on
all of them.  The chairmen of the committees support you on them,
and you have four, and if you have four, you are going to need
to go to several hundred.  If you go to several hundred, how do
you get your work done?  How do you see your family?

<p>

So what we are calling for is a bill that basically terminates the 
flow of money here.  I want to tell you, it is not a partisan thing.
It is not a Democrat thing.  They built the system up real good.
And it's not a Republican thing.  We got the system.  But it
is a system that I don't believe will allow us to balance the
budget.

<p>

I have watched each appropriation bill come to the floor,
one by one, and I have watched the fight over such things as the
National Endowment for the Arts.  Now, even if you support the
National Endowment for the Arts, should it be added to our debt
each year, being that we are spending 20 percent more than is
coming in every year?  It would make sense that would go first,
wouldn't it?

<p>

What about the tobacco subsidy?  Some of these things
make sense they would go first, wouldn't they?  Do you know that
we couldn't take them out?  Now let's go to sugar subsidy, let's
go to tobacco subsidy, peanut subsidy. But they contribute a whale
of a lot of money around here.

<p>

Now, most people would say, &quot;They only support us because we 
are philosophically with them.&quot; Well, they were philosophically 
with the Democrats last year, then, because most of the groups gave 
two to one to the Democrats, and as soon as we took control, now they 
give two to one to the Republicans.  It is amazing how they philosophically 
shifted all in one year, isn't it?

<p>

Now, the big problem is right now we didn't build it, it isn't our 
fault, but we're in it.  So you're asking a lot of people to change a 
system in the middle of a war.  It would be like asking our freshmen to 
lay down their arms in the middle of a war when their opponents are coming 
in here and raising money, because this is a war for this century. I mean, 
this is going to be whether or not we change America.

<p>

So you have the freshman Republicans, especially, coming in and saying 
we're going to clean up the system, but they are terrified of not having 
enough money with a Democrat coming up against them, and it is mostly
that direction.

<p>

So here they are.  They look like a hypocrite if they stay in the 
system and talk against it, if they use it, but they know they're 
going to be got.

<p>

Now, I have a belief. It is called a Daniel standard, and that is 
what frustrates people. Once I get to the point where I believe it's 
wrong, I don't care where God sends me, I am going to go into that land 
and I am going to follow that standard.  Daniel went in and he didn't 
eat off the table.  But what did he do?  He trusted in God for his 
provision.

<p>

Now, what we would do here is, we come in, we have a choice.
Do we follow the way of this place, pretend it doesn't affect
us -- and maybe some people it doesn't -- or do we say, &quot;I'm
not going to do it.&quot;  I don't believe everyone is called
to the same standard.  I believe they are called to right as God
shows them, but sometimes He will show you right a little before
me because He is working on me somewhere else.  I believe it is
wrong to the point where I cannot hold fund-raisers here.  I can't
do it.  You only start believing you can do it when you get here.
The real world out there doesn't think it's the right thing to
do normally.

<p>

What we're doing with the measure that I am trying
to pass is just saying, let's change the system.  I am not even
asking that we change it in the middle of this war.  I am not
asking for a Daniel standard.  All I am saying is let's vote now
and not send any more freshmen into the system, not have them
have to look you in the eye and say, &quot;Yes, I took $10,000
from the tobacco lobby, but it didn't make any difference.&quot;
That is a horrible thing.

<p>

We are just saying, at the end of this year, change it. Change the 
system.  And then, I believe, when we come back, people are going to 
trust us to make those tough decisions.  But right now they look at it 
and it is all muddled, and they go, &quot;How can we trust people when 
this is happening?&quot;

<p>

We could lose our system, I believe, by the 
lack of trust in it and what we are doing here.  I believe it is a fight 
for the Democratic system, and I think it is also a fight for whether we 
have a balanced budget, because you remember all those balanced budget 
things, they are seven years long, at least.  But every year the 
lobbyists around this place -- not bad people; they would probably like
to go home to their families, too -- every year, the special interests
grow.  There are 14,000 lobbyists.

<p>

Do you really think -- and I will leave you with this -- that by the 
end of the seven years, we can really balance the budget, with the 
amount of special-interest money that flows to this place?  I don't. For 
me to keep my word to my district to go in and balance the budget and to 
clean the system up, I have to do what I'm doing.  I don't have any 
choice.

<p>

So you will see me standing and saying, &quot;If the Republicans
are doing it, they are wrong.  If the Democrats are doing it,
they are wrong.&quot;  The situation does not dictate that this
is right because the Republicans are in control.  And in fact,
because I think God raised us up in a different way, a lot of
us miraculously, we have a greater responsibility.  People are
looking to us and saying, &quot;Is this Congress going to be different?
Is it going to be different than the old one that built a shroud
of protection around itself and became elite, or are they going
to be really a Congress of the people?&quot;  And I believe that
we have a much greater chance of preserving this democracy if
we are a Congress of the people, but I know we have to follow
God's word.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll share
more of the 1996 Washington Briefing as we hear from well-known
columnist and commentator Robert Novak.  You won't want to miss.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. Robert Novak can often
be seen on CNN's <i>Capital Gang</i> and <i>Crossfire</i>, and one 
guarantee from Mr. Novak: he's not shy when it comes to voicing his 
opinions, which he shared at the 1996 FRC Washington Briefing.

<p>

MR. NOVAK: As I go around the country, Republicans are dispirited. 
One year after they were in ecstacy, conservatives are worried.  How
did that happen?  How did it happen?  In fact, in a time when
I think the world is getting more and more conservative, when
the efficacy of government and the reliance on politics is declining
in every corner of the world, we have what is the most liberal
President we have ever had in the United States.

<p>

How did Bill Clinton get elected in the first place?  Well, we had a 
three-way race and President Bush broke his word on taxes.  And something
else.  There was something positive that President Clinton did.
Bill Clinton and his running mate went around the country, two
bubbas on a bus, telling people that they were a new kind of Democrats;
they didn't believe in too much government, too much taxation.
They were populists.

<p>

You know, I got a kick out of Al Gore calling
himself a populist.  I have known Al Gore since he was 12 years
old.  How did I know him when he was 12 years old?  Well, his
daddy, Albert Gore, Sr., was a U.S. Senator when I covered the
Senate for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> a long time ago.  I was pleased
to be a guest in their home.  They lived, they had an apartment
in the Fairfax Hotel, where little Al grew up.  The Fairfax Hotel
was partially owned by the Gore family, and today the Fairfax
Hotel, if you want to go looking for it to see a historic site,
is the Ritz Carlton Hotel.  And, you know, ladies and gentlemen,
there are very, very few populists who grow up in the Ritz Carlton
Hotel.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Little Al went on to St. Alban's, which is the fanciest prep school 
in Washington, and from there he went to Harvard, where I am told he 
studied Southern as a foreign language.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Now, Bill Clinton didn't need to develop his southern
accent.  But populist?  Georgetown School of Foreign Service,
then to Oxford, Rhodes Scholar, back to Yale Law School, where
he met Hillary Rodham; and together they went to Texas, where
they ran the McGovern for President campaign in Texas, which was
one of the 49 states that George McGovern failed to carry for
President in 1972.

<p>

After that they got married, went to Arkansas,
and Bill ran for Congress, was defeated; ran for state attorney
general, was elected; ran for governor, was elected; defeated
for reelection the first time out, then came back and won three
terms as governor; and then, first crack out of the box, ran for
President and was elected.  Very unusual to do it the first time,
the point being that President Clinton has spent almost his entire
life either running for office or serving in office, and in fact,
most of the people in his administration, contrary to all the
evidence of the 20th century, believe that government is the solution
and not the problem.  This is -- and I have been through the New
Frontier, the Great Society, Jimmy Carter -- he didn't have a
name, thank goodness -- and this is the most liberal administration,
by far.

<p>

Our newsletter which we are writing this week, we have
done a state-by-state analysis on what would happen if the election
were held today.  You know, there is a kind of euphoria among
Republicans.  They think that even though they are behind in the
popular vote, they are going to win the electoral vote.  It doesn't
happen, friends.  If the election were held today, President Clinton
would win by an electoral vote majority of -- we haven't done
the final numbers, but I think it is going to be about 130 votes
in the Electoral College.

<p>

Now, does that mean that it's over; we can go home?  Would that I 
wouldn't have to suffer through this eight-month campaign.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But, no, there's a lot of pitfalls for the President.  Pitfall number 
one is Bosnia. Yes, there are 40,000 troops in Bosnia.  The bad news 
in Bosnia is that the snow is melting, the weather is spring, and maybe
these Balkan lunatics are going to start killing each other again
and our troops will get in the way.  I pray that that doesn't
happen, and I know you all pray that, too.

<p>

But, politically, there is very little margin of error for the President. 
He wants to get these troops out quick.  Let the Muslims and the Serbs
and the Croats start killing each other again.  Nothing is going
to be solved by our being there.  But let's get them out, because
the American people didn't want them there in the first place;
they still don't want them there in the first place; and Congress
didn't want them there in the first place, but they succumbed.

<p>

The second pitfall is Whitewater.  Whitewater won't go away. 
A lot of the sophisticated people in this town say Whitewater
is not important.  I have a lot of Republicans, even, who believe
that.  All of you should read a book called <i>Blood Sport</i> by Jim
Stewart, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter, definitely,
definitely not a conservative.

<p>

Mr. Stewart, not a Washington reporter,
not a political reporter, was approached by a friend of his, Susan
Thomases, the First Lady's right-hand woman -- or should I say
left-hand woman -- asked if he could write, they would give him
access, and could he write a book on Whitewater, meaning it would
be an exculpatory book.  He got interested. They didn't give him
the cooperation that was promised, but he has written a hell of
a book.

<p>

Just today I talked to a former U.S. attorney who, going
through the book, jotting down things, found eight violations
of statutes, criminal violations, felonies.  Will the First Lady
be the first First Lady to be indicted, or even to be an unindicted
co-conspirator?  No wonder they want to end the D'Amato hearings,
put a stop to this.

<p>

The third pitfall is the economy:  0.9 percent
growth in the last quarter.  The first two quarters of this year
are going to be low growth, no growth, or negative growth.  The
economy is weak.  And the interesting thing is, as Pat Buchanan
has understood, it is weakest on the people who are in the Democratic
voting base.  Republicans are doing pretty well.  Will it get
weak enough so that it turns against the President?  No President,
when there has been a perception of an economic downturn, has
ever been reelected.

<p>

And the fourth pitfall is what the American
people think of Bill Clinton.  There is the question of whether
the American people really do want Bill Clinton in the White House
for four more years.  The Republicans have disappointed them,
I think.  I don't think they see in Senator Dole a visionary leader.
But sometimes they will say, perhaps, with all their shortcomings,
the opposition is better.  Perhaps the American people will take
a look at the issues:  Do I want more government or less?  Who
do I think is best equipped to have a social revival in this country?
And is government the problem or the solution?  That is what
is going to make this, despite everything else, an interesting
campaign.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares insight from 
Family Research Council president Gary Bauer.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. FRC president Gary Bauer is known in Washington and
across the nation for standing firm when it comes to fighting
for America's families.  Let's hear his insight on tonight's Homefront
News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: One of the central things that sort of drives what we are 
doing at FRC is the fact that for about 15 years now, all of the polling 
data has been showing that two-thirds of the American people think
that America is headed in the wrong direction.

<p>

What could be on their minds?  Why are they so filled with anxiety? Now, 
I suspect some of it is economic. There hasn't been real wage growth for
a large segment of the population for about 20 years.  There is
a great deal of concern about downsizing and all the issues in
the headlines.

<p>

But I don't really think, at the end of the day,
that it is a essentially economics that are driving the answer
to that question.  I think Americans are pondering the heart and
soul of America, and it is that which is troubling them about
the future, the sense that I think we all have that America is
one wrong turn away from a disaster.

<p>

Every place I go, people say to me, &quot;What in the world happened to 
us?  How did we get here?  When did these things take place?  How did it 
all just sort of transpire that we woke up one morning and this was where
we were living?&quot;

<p>

I think, clearly, one answer to this question
of how we got here is that, as a society, we have collectively
forgotten God.  I mean, there is just no doubt about that in my
mind.  Now, that is a very impolitic thing to say in Washington,
D.C.  If you go up to a congressional committee or before some
reporter and you say, &quot;You know, the reason we're in this
mess is because we've forgotten God,&quot; that's a pretty unusual
thing for someone to say in Washington, even today.

<p>

But it's clear. I mean, isn't it clear to you all that that is at the 
core of the problem?  This is a terribly ironic thing that has happened
in the United States.  All over this city -- you've passed them
probably in the bus and when you've been walking around in the
last day and a half - there are monuments in this city where there
are words etched in the stone that make it clear that our liberty
comes from no man but from God.  Those monuments reflect the founding
of America.

<p>

Lincoln called us the almost chosen people, and he
called us that for a reason.  Every one of us have, either in
our pockets, or you ladies, in your purses, money that says, &quot;In
God We Trust,&quot; and the phrase has become as devalued as the
money it is printed on.

<p>

Now, to listen to the cultural elite in
this city, you would think that the biggest problem facing America
is that men and women like you, men and women of faith, may actually
get into the public square, plant your feet, and not move until
you have changed the country.

<p>

I would hope you would remember that the biggest threat facing 
America is that you will not do that.  You are the only ones that 
can explain to the American people the importance of the family to 
civilization. Nobody else is going to do it.  You are the only ones who 
can make the case for racial reconciliation, because you know we are 
all created equal by God, that we are equal in His sight, and that is the
foundation upon which a society gives equality to all people regardless
of their race or their creed or their economic background.

<p>

You are the only ones that can do that.  You are the only ones that
can explain, ultimately, the sanctity of human life and why life
can't just be put up to a vote every couple of years depending
on changing mores.  If you don't get into the public square, plant
your feet, and stand for these things, I am absolutely convinced
that America will fall in the next century as surely as it would
from economic collapse.

<p>

What's the second reason that we've gotten
into the mess we're in today?  I think the second reason is our
failure as a culture to teach our children who we are, what this
experiment was all about.  The research on this is absolutely
clear.  Each generation of young Americans knows less about their
heritage, about who they are, about the shoulders of the giants
upon whom they sit as Americans than the generation before it.

<p>

Now, the trend line here is clear.  A country for whom its children
are forgetting the basics or are never taught the basics is a
country in trouble.

<p>

I would like to suggest to you tonight that
we are not going to reform American education in the next year,
the next five years, or the next ten years, so we are going to
have to take it upon ourselves to make sure that our children
know the minutes of the last meeting, that they know about the
values that the country was built upon.

<p>

We have to teach our children who said, &quot;Give me liberty or 
give me death&quot; and who said, &quot;I have a dream.&quot; We need 
to teach them about what happened at Normandy, what happened at 
Concord Bridge, what happened on Pork Chop Hill, and how their liberty 
was born and nurtured in those places. We need to show them what 
Constitution Hall looks like, what good music sounds like, what the 
lady in New York Harbor stands for, why there was a Berlin Wall and what
the forces were that brought that wall down.

<p>

We need to teach them about Ruth and Naomi, Jonathan and David. In short, 
it is up to us to teach them to love the things we love and to honor
the things we honor, because nothing less than that will do.

<p>

Finally, I think the third thing that has happened is that we are in 
the process in America of separating virtue from liberty.  If we 
separate virtue from liberty, which is what the society in this 
culture is doing today, then the consequences are inevitable.

<p>

I think I have talked to some of you before about the absolutely 
incredible reaction to the death of Jerry Garcia, the lead singer of 
the band, the Grateful Dead.  But the thing that astonished me was,
here's Jerry Garcia that never got out of the sixties.  The man
was a dope addict and an alcoholic his entire life.  And yet when
he died last year, the culture treated his death as if a great
hero had passed from the scene.  It was one of the lead items
on all the evening news.  I watched United States Senators leave
committee hearing rooms to go out into the hallways and speak
to banks of cameras to say how much their lives had been touched
by Jerry Garcia.

<p>

There is something wrong, ladies and gentlemen,
when people like Jerry Garcia are held up as great heroes and
yet one-half of American 16-year-olds cannot tell you the correct
half-century the American Civil War took place. That's a problem.

<p>

And I suppose that there is no issue that is a clearer example
of the separation of virtue from liberty than the issue you have
heard about time and time again in the last day and a half, and
that is the sanctity of human life.  I mean, this is the marker
issue.  I suspect that there are probably some of you who would
maybe prefer that we not harp on it so much.  We can't stop harping
on it.

<p>

I believe it defines who we are as a country, and if we
ever rolled back abortion on demand, almost every other issue
we were dealing with, I think, would fall into place in a very
short period of time.  This issue is at the core of what our liberty
means and the role that virtue plays in moderating that liberty.

<p>

And so this organization, the Family Research Council, will
never back off on the abortion issue.  Men and women like you
who bring new life into the world, who stand for these values,
who will do anything for blood of their blood, flesh of their
flesh, that is courage, and that is what the Family Research Council
will stand for as long as I am here and this great staff that
you have met is here, and with your help.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents insider information from those who attended the recent 1996 
National Education Summit.

<p>

Education affects the pro-family movement on many levels, and there is 
no shortage of controversy.  One recent example is the constant battling
over public school curriculum, which deletes key historical events
but somehow manages to teach children an amoral value system,
complete with bad advice on sex.  It seems clear that as a country
we can no longer ignore the fact that educational standards, measured
by students' knowledge and performance, have drastically plummeted.

<p>

The 1996 National Education Summit was supposed to address that
learning crisis.  The conference was organized by IBM CEO and
chairman Lou Gerstner, Jr., with the help of the governors and
other high-ranking businessmen.  But will their solutions for
a broken school system help your children?  Stay tuned to learn
more.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Cathy Cleaver, Family Research
Council's Director of Legal Policy.  Cathy has been involved heavily
in an issue that affects all families and all children, pornography.
Because of numerous court cases attacking the legal boundaries
around our children, the pornography industry has a lot of power
today, but there are some key legal battles in the works.  Stay
with us as Cathy fills us in on what the pornographers don't want
you to know about what goes on behind the headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Cathy, thank you so much for being with us today on Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is my pleasure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There has been a lot of news out recently from Los 
Angeles and New York and now Philadelphia on pornography and the 
telecommunications bill, pornography on the Internet, and reading 
the news reports, is it fair to say that it would be smashing blow 
to the First Amendment if we see restrictions on the Internet?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I love the way you put that, and that is really how 
to phrase this question.  The ACLU and others who are fighting to 
get this new computer pornography law restrained make just that point: 
If we don't have free-flowing pornography to every child in America, 
we have lost our valuable First Amendment freedoms.

<p>

That's ridiculous.  Most courts think that's ridiculous, and we are 
counting on that.  The Supreme Court, of course, has said we don't 
have to have that, that pornography is not a measure of our freedom; 
rather, it is a sort of low-level type of speech that we need to 
tolerate at some levels, but certainly we don't need to have our 
children tolerate it.

<p>

So I believe that the challenges that are going on across the country 
are just the same challenges we have always seen and that our side 
will be successful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Just yesterday, you were in Philadelphia at the court 
case there.  Tell us a little bit about what's going on there and 
how it will affect parents.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: In February, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was 
signed into law by President Clinton. Part of that act included the 
Communications Decency Act, which is simply a law that says adults 
have no right to knowingly give pornography to children over computer 
systems.  Makes sense.

<p>

Well, the ACLU and other groups immediately filed a lawsuit saying
that this is going to ruin our cherished freedom of free speech,
and we have this drama played out in a federal court in Philadelphia.
I have attended every day of the hearing, and it has been quite
a show, with sex experts saying that children should see pornography,
that it's not harmful; other people saying that the Internet will
just cease to be if this restriction is in place.

<p>

The Department of Justice is defending the law, and they are doing a 
good job. I was pleased to see that they are vigorous in their defense
of the law, and I believe they believe in its constitutionality.
Certainly Janet Reno and the policy makers at Justice had some
trouble in 1994 with child pornography and weakening the statute,
and we don't see a replay of that yet.  Frankly, I don't think
they have the political capital to waste on another debacle like
that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of people may not remember what the
Clinton Administration did on that child porn case, where essentially
they tried to change the law to say that if a child who is being
molested appears to be participating in all of this, that somehow
they are at fault.  It is an astounding legal principle, isn't
it?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It was a terrible burden to put on the prosecution,
and I would say that it would really bring any child pornography
prosecution to a screeching halt.  It would never be prosecuted
under the types of burdens that the Justice Department at that
time was suggesting.  But that was turned around, public outrage,
and healthy public outrage and efforts from all groups, including
the Family Research Council.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We hear a lot from the American Civil Liberties Union 
that somehow, if we don't have pornography on the Internet, the 
Internet will cease to be, as though perhaps it were created, we must 
assume, for the purpose of transmitting hard core, obscene images. But 
what is the ACLU's history on pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is very radical. They lead the charge in trying to 
legalize child pornography, even hard core child pornography where a 
child is shown being raped. The ACLU believes that once a video or 
a magazine of this child's rape has been produced, it is a sacred 
text that must be protected by the First Amendment.

<p>

They are out of touch. We wouldn't want to live in an ACLU world. 
And, thankfully, our courts have not bought in to their arguments. 
But they keep trying, and they are trying again here, with the same 
sort of notion, that someone should be allowed to intentionally give 
a child pornography. And the ACLU, of course, also believes that 
children have a right to see pornography.

<p>

So they are leading the charge against the Communications Decency 
Act, along with People for the American Way, the American Library 
Association, and the cast of characters that we have seen time and 
time again who defend the pornographers and their right to make 
profits in selling this kind of material.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A typical comeback from the pornography industry
and the so-called First Amendment people is that it's the parents'
problem, it's the parents' responsibility.  How do you respond
to that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Well, I say time and again that no law
is designed to fill the role of a parent, and neither is this
law, nor has anyone suggested that this law is to substitute for
a parent.  Rather, parents are no match for an $8 billion to $10
billion a year pornography industry.

<p>

There is a role for government to play in protecting children or 
protecting anybody that is weaker in society from elements that are 
stronger in society. That's what our criminal laws are all about, 
and we have criminal laws that prevent an adult from exploiting a child 
through pornography. That is a consistent theme we have seen in 200 
years of laws. And that is the same theme we have with this law.

<p.

Parents certainly have a role, and there is no one taking that role away. 
But they need help.  They can't do it alone.  And the responsibility 
should always remain on the shoulders of that person who is dealing in
harmful material, just like in the instance of toxic waste or
something like that.  If you emit toxic waste in your business,
you have a responsibility to curb that.  Similarly, if you are
distributing pornography, you have a responsibility to keep it
from kids.

<p>

That is really a legal principle that we as a society
have embraced that has been fought by these civil liberty groups,
but we have embraced that, and the courts have upheld that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Let's say that a parent really does buy the ACLU line
and accepts the fact that they are supposed to be the sole defender
of their child.  Is it possible for a child to really block pornography
and obscenity from their home with the blocking technologies today?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Absolutely not.  We have seen many instances in
which parents have tried to employ this blocking technology, and
pornography has still reached their children.  Pornography that
is attached to an e-mail message, for instance, is not blocked
by the software.

<p>

During this hearing, very interesting testimony from SurfWatch, the 
leading software filtering company right now. I have nothing against 
SurfWatch or the filtering companies, and they will provide somewhat 
of a help to parents.  But they want to be a substitute for a law.

<p>

Yet, in the hearing, they admitted that they miss 800 pornographic sites 
per month. And they say, &quot;Well, that's not so bad.&quot;  Well, I 
think parents think that's bad. That's a lot of sites of material that
could just ruin a child's mental health, frankly.

<p.

So it is ridiculous to think that sort of technology can be a complete 
substitute for a law.  We are left with hoping that pornography 
distributors will, of their own, decide not to harm our children. 
History has not shown that that is a good assumption.

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A lot of people are not aware that, under American law, the 
way in which we have regulated communication is the way in which 
something is transmitted, so that you cannot send something threatening
through the mails, for example; you cannot sell pornography without
some kind of adult supervision; you have to have a restricted
access.  So we have really regulated transmission of information.

<p>

As we look at the Internet, a new way to transmit information,
are we seeing any new laws being made?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: With this new medium, all we're doing is importing laws 
that our country has embraced for decades.  There is no new legal theory 
at play here.  It's the same old principle that people who distribute
pornography cannot distribute it to children.

<p>

It is interesting, because every time a new technology develops, first 
of all, pornographers rush in and exploit that technology, sometimes 
drive it, I am sorry to say, drive its development.  And then, secondly, 
the porn defenders come in and say, &quot;Well, pornography law can't
apply in this technology.  Certainly videos are different than
magazines, and certainly pornography laws shouldn't apply to videos.&quot;
That's what we heard in the early 1980s, if you can believe it
or not.

<p>

Well, that argument failed, and we have seen that with
television, telephone, cable, and now we are seeing it with the
computer and with the Internet.  It's the same old song, and it's
really nothing new that this new computer porn law is doing. 
It's just relatively different because it's a different medium.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Taking a look at some of these different transmission
issues right now, there's a new law in California dealing with
a new way of distributing pornography, newsstands, magazine racks
right next to other newspaper boxes that actually sell hard core
pornography. What's your involvement in that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: I love this new law in California.  For all its troubles 
with pornography, California has come up with some good, innovative 
laws to protect communities and families.  One such new law is a law 
against pornographic news racks.  What we are seeing springing up in 
California are news racks right on the street, next to the regular news, 
with hard core pornography.  So any child with 25 cents can receive
that magazine.

<p>

Well, there's a new law now that says those news
racks that distribute hard core porn cannot exist unless they
are supervised 24 hours a day by an adult, or unless they are
accessible only by adult tokens.  That makes sense, because then
adults can get the material that they might have a right to get,
but certainly children cannot.

<p>

That is causing such a stir in California, and we are filing a brief 
in support of that law. We think that law is fully constitutional. And 
actually, the consequences of this lawsuit are really grave.  If we 
were to lose this one, then I would venture to say we will see 
pornographic news racks popping up all over the country.  So this is a 
crucial case for communities and families.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Cathy, so much for being with us today on 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: You're welcome.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
begins our inside scoop from those who attended the 1996 National 
Education Summit.  Are America's leaders serious about making positive 
changes in our children's education?  Stay tuned to find out.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Reading, writing, and arithmetic were once the core of 
education. Yet there are students across the United States today who 
actually graduate from high school lacking these basic skills.

<p>

Clinton's national education standards and Goals 2000 both promised to 
fill the gap and prepare students for life.  But questions among parents
and educators arose regarding these standards.  Were children
going to be better educated, well read, insightful, and intellectual?
Or will they merely be illiterate but politically correct?

<p>

Burdened with the cost of teaching basic skills to many entry-level 
workers, corporate America decided to get involved.  Lou Gerstner, Jr.,
CEO and chairman of IBM, spearheaded a movement to evaluate our
education system and began by organizing the 1996 National Education
Summit.  Governors, CEOs, and policy makers from across the country,
including President Clinton, attended the summit in an attempt
to agree on a newly improved standard.

<p>

This commitment to educational excellence, which was documented and 
signed by all the governors, seemed like a step in the right direction. 
But what about the voices of those who were visibly not in attendance, 
including conservative leaders with strong grass-roots appeal, private 
school representatives, and, most importantly, parents?

<p>

Developing a sound education policy may not seem controversial, but 
experts agree that parents, educators, and corporate America still have
a long way to go.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To tell us just how far we have to go to actually see 
improvement in our children's education, I am joined by Robert 
Morrison, Family Research Council's Special Assistant to the 
President, whose experience at the Department of Education well 
prepared him for his policy role today.

<p>

We also have Michelle Easton, president of the Virginia State Board 
of Education.  As a representative of Governor Allen, Michelle has
acted as a key pro-family advocate.

<p>

And also joining us is Carolee Adams, who attended the 1996 National 
Education Summit on <i>Straight Talk</i>'s behalf, our own special 
correspondent.

<p>

They are all here to talk to us today, and welcome to the show.

<p>

Michelle, let's start with you.  You were there with Governor Allen, 
and although IBM organized the event, was very powerful as a force, 
ostensibly, everybody said, well, this is really a governors' event. 
So you were there with the governor.  Why don't you tell us the good
news, if there was any.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, there was some good news. Every governor was allowed 
to bring along one staff person and asked to bring one business person, 
and I was his staff person.

<p>

Governor Allen went to the meeting with some 
serious concerns about the policy summit statement that had been drafted, 
and he was very successful in persuading the other governors to make
some changes to that document, to make it more acceptable to those
of us who feel the Federal Government has almost no role in education;
that is for the states and localities to make decisions, and preferably
localities to the greatest extent possible.

<p>

He was given credit in the press for that. The <i>Washington Times</i> here, 
I have an article, the day after the summit:  &quot;Summit Policy Position 
Altered.&quot; And it says, &quot;Led by Governor Allen, they rewrote the 
policy statement to better reflect conservative views and reaffirm that
the states and not the Federal Government play the major role
in education.&quot;  So that was a success of the summit, that
all the governors voted for a statement, and the CEOs voted, also,
affirming that it is not the Federal Government where decisions
should be made about education; it is states and at the local
level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, you are experienced in education.  A
long time back, I remember Ronald Reagan was going to get rid
of the Department of Education, very much affirming the position
that the states had a role by getting rid of the federal role.
Obviously, that did not happen.

<p>

Maybe you can tell us at the beginning of our conversation, in a 
nutshell, what the bad news was.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, unfortunately, the summit had an opportunity
to really make some gains.  They could have talked very seriously
about what we think is the most important reform in education:
letting parents choose safe and effective schools for their children.

<p>

Regrettably, those who led the summit pushed that pretty much
off the agenda and ruled it out of order.  We think they are incorrect
in that respect.  When parents can choose an excellent public,
private, religious, or home school, that in itself brings about
high achievement, high standards, and safe schools.

<p>

It is an irony, because business, including Lou Gerstner, Jr., the 
chairman of IBM, they continue to tell us what it is they seek from 
our education system, what they are hoping to get from our graduates. 
The schools that we champion, the schools that we highly respect and 
encourage, are the very schools that do the job that business says it 
wants done.

<p>

So we think as more corporate executives who weren't perhaps
at the summit or whose voices weren't heard at the summit, especially
as those who are small business and entrepreneurs, those who are
actually responsible for 90 percent of the new jobs and new goods
and services, when they find out how much bureaucracy is going
to be added on as a result of Goals 2000, as a result of certificates
of initial mastery, we think they are going to join into a national
movement to repeal Goals 2000, get rid of the Department of Education,
and not to impose national standards and a national curriculum
on America's communities.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, Carolee, we were blessed to have our own special 
correspondent in you there, and you are also a home schooler yourself, 
and you certainly represent a new wave.  And it is interesting. Family 
Research Council has done some polling that home schoolers are made up 
by a lot of interesting constituencies -- some Perot people, some 
independent-minded people, real popular with certain 1960s radicals 
and conservative pro-family Americans. Did you see your interest in 
other kinds of educational opportunities represented?

<p>

MS. ADAMS: No, unfortunately. I certainly am a proponent of children, 
students, being accountable for things that they learn in school. In 
my community we are spending $16,500 a year per child to educate 
children, so they should be accountable.

<p>

However, we have chosen to home school for a number of different reasons. 

<p>

In my interview with one of the governors, I said to him, I brought to 
him the situation, I said -- it was Governor Tommy Thompson -- and I 
said, &quot;I'll bring to you a situation of a little boy by the name of 
Tommy. And Tommy is a real wiggly Willie, and he doesn't want to sit
still in his seat, and he can't read, can't write.  He is incorrigible.
His teacher doesn't know what to do with him, so his momma pulls
him out of school.&quot;

<p>

Now, if his momma hadn't pulled him out of school, we wouldn't have 
had all the lights, the camera, and the action, because it's Tommy 
Edison that I'm talking about. And so I asked Governor Thompson, I 
said, &quot;What are you going to do with a little boy by the name of 
Tommy Edison?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, we'll give him a second 
test.&quot;

<p>

This is where I feel we have a sincere problem of understanding about
different learning styles, the necessity of parental involvement,
and that standards are important, technology is important, but
there is a lot more to it than that, and home schoolers would
be encouraged, from Governor Thompson's words, to participate
in the forum, and I know that they already are being tracked with
certain types of governmental programs, and that is regrettable.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Virginia has been very lucky to have Governor Allen
taking a real leadership.  There are all kinds of educational
reforms out there, charter schools.  From your perspective at
a state level, why is the state better able to have a role in
education, and how can the states better accommodate people like
Carolee?

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, the state is better that the Federal
Government simply, plainly, common sense, because it's closer
to the people.  But the local level is even better in terms of
making decisions and spending money.

<p>

In Virginia, our local school districts have a tremendous amount 
of autonomy.  Now, there is a fair amount of money that comes from 
the state level, and it varies by jurisdiction. The poorer 
jurisdictions get more state money than the more affluent ones. 

<p>

But in Virginia what we have been trying to do under the leadership 
of Governor Allen and how his State Board of Education -- he has 
appointed the majority of members of that now; it took a couple of 
years to get that - is to have the state's role be very limited but 
very useful.

<p>

The first thing we did is we decided we wanted to set up 
some academic standards in the core academic areas of English, science,
math, and history.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The pragmatic core subjects, not how do you feel about 
math but whether you can do it.

<p>

MS. EASTON: That's right. It took over a year. These are the standards
of learning here, and I have an 800 number if your listeners might
want to get a copy of them.  They are not perfect.  They are not
perfect by any means.  But you won't find in here anywhere how
do you feel about something.  It's what do you know, what do you
know.

<p>

This was our first step in trying to have the state set
a framework.  Now, we don't tell schools how to teach this.  We
don't tell them what books to use.  We don't tell them what methods
to use on the local level.  Now, these are public schools only.
In Virginia, mercifully, we leave the private schools alone pretty
much.

<p>

We set out the standards, then devise a set of state tests.
Did you learn this stuff?  The tests that our kids currently
take, for the most part, in the public schools are called norm-referenced
tests where they are measured against some mass of children, and
the results come out, and they are very confusing.  We want to
test kids, did you learn your history?  This is straightforward
history, kindergarten to 12th grade, a series of tests, and then
we want to publicize the results of those tests.

<p>

Then what happens? We want to let localities decide what to do.  We want 
to create a dynamic so there are rigorous academic standards, there are
good tests on them, a lot of information -- are you learning this
stuff?  Do you know your history?  Do you know your English? 
Do you know your science? -- and then let localities do what has
to be done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to want to hear that 800 number really fast 
and come back.

<p>

MS. EASTON: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Give us that 800 number.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  It is 1-800-292-3820.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Grab a paper and pencil.  You can write that again after
the break.  Please join us after the commercial break as we continue
to discuss educational change with our group of insiders.  Stay
tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined again by some experts who are actively involved 
in efforts to restructure education. We have again Robert Morrison, 
special assistant to Gary Bauer at the Family Research Council; Michelle 
Easton, president of the Virginia State Board of Education; and Carolee 
Adams, a home-school mother and long-time education activist and our own 
<i>Straight Talk</i> correspondent. Thank you again for being with us. 

<p>

When we left before, we were taking a look at the fact that Virginia -- 
you know, a lot of the reason why people are upset about standards
is the standards have not been very academic; they have been quite
philosophical:  you know, how do you feel, what do you think about?
Virginia has tried to do something different, and you have an
800 number where people can get a sample.  Give that again.

<p>

MS. EASTON: Yes. It is 1-800-292-3820, our new, rigorous, knowledge-based,
academic Virginia standards.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Bob, you are tracking what all 50 states are doing 
and were at the governors' convention, National Education Summit, 
looking at all 50 states.  How does what Virginia is doing, pragmatic 
work, compare to what is happening or what you fear might happen?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, we are very complimentary of Virginia. We 
definitely approve of what Governor Allen has done in resisting the 
idea of further federal encroachments in the education area. We 
applauded when Governor Allen stood up very tall and straight and 
said, &quot;No, we don't want to do this. We want to go back and bring 
authority back to where it belongs, to localities, to elected school 
boards, to parents.&quot; Governor Allen has been a champion in that 
regard.

<p>

In other states, we commended Governor Merrill in New Hampshire [who] 
has not applied for Goals 2000 funding; Governor Keating in Oklahoma; 
Governor Foster in Louisiana. Out in California, Governor Wilson is not
taking Goals 2000 funding.  So we think there should be a national
move to resist the kind of bureaucratization of education and
the dumbing down, frankly, that has come from Goals 2000.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But, Bob, I think one thing that is interesting is a
lot of people have this very false perception that the Federal
Government is paying for education; that if we get rid of the
Department of Education, we have just de-funded our schools.

<p>

But you have an interesting formula.  It is like a dollar's worth,
one dollar in every hundred?

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Yes, right. In Montana I think the figure came out 
to something like $1.50 per student that they would have gained if 
they took the Goals 2000 money. But the Goals 2000 money works in 
another way.  It's not very much and it doesn't help you a whole 
lot, but as it is often said, the worm doesn't have to be very big 
to conceal the hook.  So if you just bite, you're hooked.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How is that?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, because Goals 2000 is very, very directive in
terms of what you are going to do.  You are going to have to restructure
your schools.  You are going to have to have your programs approved
of by various people.  Right now they've got a new entity that
may be approving of your standards in history, math, science,
and English.

<p>

We have already seen the initial efforts nationally
out there for history standards.  The first two efforts have been
a disaster.  The first effort was so horrible for national history
standards that the U.S. Senate voted 99 to 1 to reject them.

<p>

So they went back to the drawing board, and they said, &quot;Okay,
we are, after all, historical revisionists.  We can revise.&quot;

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So they took 15 months, they revised, and the second
set comes out, and they tell kids that in national history standards
we have to think that Goals 2000 is a good idea because these
standards endorse Goals 2000; we have to think that redesigning
the family, redefining the family, is a good idea because they
define the family in the history standards as a group from which
we receive love and support.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Well, that's nice, but that's not all families do and 
it's not all they are.

<p>

They also make a bid for equalization of school
funding.  What has this got to do with U.S. history, we might
ask.  Nothing.  That's the whole point.  A lot of what is in there
has nothing to do with it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So what we find is that the Federal Government throws 
in maybe one dollar per child and then demands control over how you 
spend all the rest of your money.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  When I served in the U.S. Department of Education,
some of the career civil servants there, good folks that they
were, said, &quot;We couldn't be doing all these bonehead things,
Bob.  You got us all wrong. We only provide 6 percent of the funding,
just 6 cents out of the dollar.&quot;

<p>

So finally, after two weeks of orientation, I asked one of these fine 
folks, I said, &quot;Have you ever been to India?  Have you ever seen 
the mahouts in India? They are very small guys.  They only weigh about 
100 pounds. They only weigh about 6 percent of what the elephant weighs.
But they've got this stick, and when they jab the stick behind
the elephant's ear, the elephant goes the way they want him to.&quot;

<p>

And that is the problem we face.  Even when you have good reforms,
the Federal Government can make it impossible.  I just have one
example.  Ohio attempted to have an eighth grade reading requirement
for high school graduation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: And you would think that President Clinton would say, 
&quot;Good for you.  You're at least raising standards.&quot;  His 
Education Department sued the state of Ohio not because eighth grade was
too low but because it was too high.

<p>

MS. EATON:  And yet President Clinton came to the summit and gave a 
speech that could have been written by George Allen or Ronald Reagan, 
saying, &quot;Oh, we need to have tests; we need to have accountability; 
we need to hold children back when they don't perform.&quot;  It almost 
makes you feel that he says one thing and does another.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, imagine that.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  You know, George Allen is one
of my favorite choices for Bob Dole's Vice President, so I'm on
your side.  However, I will say this.  Governor Allen said to
me that this was not a tops-down procedure; this is a bottoms-up
procedure.  But I have a great concern that that isn't going to
happen that way.

<p>

As an example, at the final press conference,
Lou Gerstner got up.  He is the chairman of IBM.  He said that
these transcripts and the certificates of mastery, everything
is going to be ready in one year's time.  Now, if a child doesn't
have that transcript or doesn't have that certificate, then they
can't get a job.

<p>

Also, I sensed that the child is also going to
be geared -- I mean, this is the third wave.  This is your new
industrial revolution becoming a technological revolution.

<p>

I was reading Alvin Toffler's book about the third wave, and he cited
that when we were moving from an agrarian society in the early
1800s over to an industrial society that covertly the children
were being trained to do things in a methodical way; that they
were able to get up on time, be at school on time, do this on
time, so that they could get a job and be there from 9 to 5.

<p>

So whatever we are going to be educating the children in school today
is going to have to fit.  This is what the CEOs want, particularly
those who are using modern technology to a large degree.  They
are going to have these kids come in well trained to use technological
equipment.

<p>

I heard one of the governors say or one of the CEOs
say, &quot;We have enough lawyers.  We have enough philosophers.&quot;
However, we can't overlook the fact that we still need lawyers
and we still need philosophers, and education is not to give them
a job.  Education is for the sake of education.

<p>

I am not a liberal thinker at all, but I think the entire summit lost out 
[in that] the systemic problems of education were not addressed, and I 
believe Governor Ridge wanted to.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of time left, but maybe in one 
minute, Michelle, you could sum this up, because one thing that has 
not been addressed, this was really set up by corporate America for 
corporate America's goals, which are not necessarily the goals of a 
parent, that their child be well-rounded and well-read. Quickly, what 
would you see corporate America's goals were?

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, I think one reason the scope of the summit was so 
limited, and we didn't get into things like school choice and 
school-to-work and other issues like that, is when you have 50 
governors -- liberals, conservatives, Republicans,
Democrats -- to get them all to agree on something is very difficult.
So they focused very narrowly on standards and on more technology
in schools, and that was clearly what the CEOs wanted at this
particular meeting.  It was something they thought they could
get through, get everybody to vote for, and I think with some
of the changes that Governor Allen and some of the other conservatives
got in, where we keep stressing that there is not a federal role
in those things, it was successful in that sense.

<p>

But it is certainly true that there are many, many other issues that need 
to be addressed and discussed, and there are some CEOs that are more 
interested in training students for jobs, while others, big and small 
business, really are more interested in what many of us want, which is 
children with good basic skills and knowledge to come into the workplace
and then they will train them for the specific jobs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to find out if that's a brave new world
or a new horizon, and in a moment, when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns,
we'll hear about how our country's educational system is still
in need of an overhaul, and we'll find out more after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once again my guests, 
Robert Morrison, Michelle Easton, and Carolee Adams, all of whom 
attended the 1996 National Education Summit.

<p>

Now, Carolee, you were talking before the break about corporate
America, something which you are quite experienced in.  You were
a vice president for Citibank, I think, for 15 years and a manager
of people, and so I think you can appreciate the fact that you
would like your workers to read and write and use the computer.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  Oh, absolutely.  There is no doubt.  I mean, a large
corporation like IBM, as an example, spends an exorbitant amount
of money on training, retraining, I mean teaching them how to
read and write, but also college-level students.  I know a friend
of mine who works for a major consumer goods -- it's food products
-- and he has his Ph.D. in food chemistry.  He said, &quot;We
assume that when they get out of college, they know nothing. 
We retrain them from the beginning.&quot;  So the corporations
have to cut back on their expenses.  They are very competitive.
The words that kept emanating out of the conference were, &quot;We
want to compete in a global marketplace.&quot;  So the children
have to come in well trained.

<p>

However, I am deeply concerned that this entire philosophy is not 
akin to the American spirit.  We have not heretofore before -- and I 
think Governor Hunt said this -- we have never done this before, and there 
is a book out called <i>The Coming Revolution in Education</i> by a Professor 
Boyce out of the University of Georgia, and he said that we haven't in 
the past created a school system to really fill jobs, and --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But is that the purpose of our school system?  I mean,
is that an appropriate purpose?  Schools make just workers?

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  No, that's not.  The purpose of the school is to educate
them.  A liberal education is supposed to give them an opportunity,
particularly your K-12 grades. They are there to experiment with
a lot of different things. Am I going to be a great mathematician,
a scientist, an artist, a wonderful mother?  I mean, that is something
that -- you know, they are dropping out home economics out of
a lot of courses in high school.  That's not required.  I have
a real problem with that, and so that is for colleges to do.

<p>

I was at a conference on the stock market on Wall Street, and there
was a gentleman, head of a major exchange, and he kept talking
about how the CEOs and the teachers were going to revamp the educational
system.  No, no, no.  It's parents and students [who] have to
be included, and I found that missing at the education summit.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Did you find that missing, as well, Bob, because
I know that is one of your primary concerns, that we are losing
the purpose of education.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, sure.  One of the things that -- we share this 
with business at all levels. Parents have a great stake in a quality 
education for their children. They also have a great economic stake in 
their children's education. You will find very few parents who are 
indifferent, don't care whether their children are able to get a job 
after they finish high school or college.

<p>

So there's a tremendous incentive for parents to get the best education 
for their kids. When parents can choose their children's schools, they 
routinely choose a school that will have high standards.  No parent wants 
[his child] to go to a school that does poorly and that kids are ill 
prepared, and the parents are very harsh when they find that that's what
the school has done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What is the statistic?  I mean, certainly in Washington, 
D.C., the President and the Vice President both send their children to 
faith-based private institutions. You were telling me the other day 
that the majority of public school teachers' children were also in 
private schools.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: In many major city school systems, you will find 30, 40 
percent, 50 percent in some.  One of the debates with Keith Geiger, the
president of the National Education Association, when Bill Bennett
charged him and said that 50 percent of Chicago teachers had their
kids in private schools, and Geiger said, &quot;No, it's only
40 percent.&quot;

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Well, four out of ten.  The other teachers had their kids in suburban 
school districts.

<p>

Our point is that there are excellent public schools, excellent private, 
religious, and home schools.  Parents choose the best school they can 
get.

<p>

As to the summit and the failure that we saw in the 
summit, it is [that] the difficulty is the old New Hampshire phrase, 
&quot;You can't get there from here.&quot;  By taking over more and more
power to a national entity, they are describing a new board, a
new agency, a new creation that they want to build which will
have power to bully states that are good --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us about that.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Many of the CEOs and many of the governors
were very supportive of a notion in the draft summit statement,
which we did manage to amend somewhat, which would have created
a new national organization -- just what we need -- to help states
share information about creating standards and reform, to compare
standards to each other, to European nations.

<p>

Governor Allen said, &quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute.  This makes me 
uncomfortable. It has the smell of a governmental thing.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Oh, no, no, no, it's not governmental, just all of us getting 
together.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;Why do we need it?  If you want Virginia's 
standards, get on the Internet, get to our web site.  There you've got 
them. Do you want to talk to us about how we did it?  Give us a 
call.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Oh, well, we need it to help us coordinate and do this more
effectively.&quot;

<p>

What he did manage to do was to give us all
respite on it, and they took the language out of the statement
that said this would happen instantly, and it was made into they'll
come back with a proposal in July to the governors.  But, I mean,
what a worrisome thing.  Just what we need, another national organization,
another bureaucracy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And what would it do?  I mean, what would it do that 
the Department of Education hasn't done badly?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Set the standards, set the tests, and decide
what happens to the kids or the schools or the administrators
if the kids don't pass the tests.

<p>

Now, some of the things that are going to happen if you don't get the 
certificate of initial mastery are you won't get a driver's license, 
you won't be able to get a job at 16 or at 18 or go to college.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So what would home schoolers do, for example?  Are they 
going to be --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  They will conform or else.

<p>

MS. ADAMS: That is what Governor Thompson said. &quot;They will be 
encouraged.&quot; And so I think that that is --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Government doesn't encourage.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  Those were kind words.  I found people
speaking differently throughout my interviews.  This was going
to be, you know, bottoms up not a tops down.  I think it's tops
down.  I think we have to be honest about this.  For the most
part, not all states perhaps, but if you're going to have an IBM
which gets people from every one of our states, then those 50
states are going to have to -- somebody in Idaho is going to say,
&quot;Well, I want my child to work for IBM.&quot;  &quot;Well,
you don't participate in the program.&quot;  And they are going
to be encouraged to participate, home schoolers, private schools.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Which is a Soviet system.  I mean, let's be honest.
The Soviet system preprograms your path and you get there --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  It is much more -- it is actually probably more
-- to be fair about it, they are talking openly.  Mark Tucker
of the National Center on Education and the Economy urged Hillary
and Bill Clinton to take a page from the German book. <i>Newsweek</i>
magazine says we're going to move toward a German system.

<p>

But <i>Newsweek</i>'s business section, in the same issue, April 8, 
talked about the German system and the &quot;German disease&quot; --
12 percent unemployment rate, higher than that youth unemployment
rate, great concern, skinhead phenomena, a little bit of the kind
of Pink Floyd record, just another brick in the wall.

<p>

MS. EATON: The problem with the European model is when you take a kid 
in tenth grade or ninth grade and you train him for one job and then
that company goes bust or he gets fired for some reason, and he
is not prepared to shift to another corporation, to another job.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think we have gone for a broad vision in America.

<p>

You get our last comment.

<p>
MS. ADAMS:  Oh.  I have encouraged the CEOs that I have met, if they're 
going to work hard to improve their bottom line, they do as much as they 
can to lobby congress to enable parents to parent once again, whether 
that be increased tax exemptions or some method of reducing the $484 
billion a year that we spend on education rather foolishly right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have been privileged to have you all with us, and I hope 
people will call for your standards, or you can call the Family Research
Council.

<p>

When you return, <i>Straight Talk</i> will show you a clip from
Gary Bauer's appearance on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>. We will hear what
Gary has to say about education.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>.

<p>

Gary Bauer made an appearance on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> following
a decision made by a Queens, New York, school superintendent who
advocated teaching first graders that the homosexual lifestyle
was the moral equivalent of marriage.  Gary met some hard and
fast opponents when discussing this issue with Bob Beckel(?) and
Deborah Haffner(?), executive director of the Sex Information
and Education Council.

<p>

Let's hear what Gary has to say as <i>Straight Talk</i> presents 
Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

[Segment from CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, December 8, 1992, follows:]

<p>

MR. BECKEL: -- Gary, two pages out of 430 or so in a recommended
curriculum.  You guys take this thing and the yahoos in Queens
take this thing, and they blow it into a big deal.  We talk about
it on television.  Isn't this really what -- let's talk about
it for what it is.  It's fodder for you guys to put in your direct
mail pieces to raise a lot of money to fund your right-wing causes
under the guise of pro-family, when really what you are is a reactionary
crowd who are cutting out a whole segment of society.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Bob, you know, you are in your usual emotionalism.  Nobody 
sent any direct mail to the Hispanic and black parents in the Queens
School District who are vehemently objecting to the idea that
their children ought to be taught that homosexuality is normal
and on a par with the heterosexual family.

<p>

If Deborah wants to read <i>Heather Has Two Mommies</i> to her children 
at home, that's her business.  But when she and Fernandez and others try 
to take our tax money to teach first graders that these are acceptable 
lifestyles, they are crossing a line that has nothing to do with direct 
mail.

<p>

You don't have a right to overrule parents when they feel uncomfortable
about teaching their children something.  The parents of Queens
have been very clear about this.  They don't want their 6- and
7-year-olds being taught about strange lifestyles.  They want
their kids to be taught reading, writing, the history of this
country.  If the schools in New York would do that, they would
turn out successful students.

<p>

MS. HAFFNER: Gary, what about --

<p>

MR. BAUER: I would love to see parents have a chance to vote
on that.

<p>

MR. BECKEL: The parents just decide everything in the school?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  On controversial social matters, parents ought
to have a right to tell how their tax dollars are going to be
used, not to vote on what history is going to be taught, not to
vote about what math is going to be taught, but when you get into
areas of values, parents have a right to have input.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with 
us to hear how you can get more information regarding these issues 
affecting you and your family.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. If you would like to receive more 
information about our organization, tonight's guests, or the topics 
discussed, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week we will be discussing an issue not often seen in secular 
news coverage:  religious liberty and Christian persecution around the 
world.  We will hear how thousands of people are sacrificing their 
lives for a faith which they refuse to deny because their government 
demands it. Could America be headed in that direction?  We'll find out 
next week as we bring you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
delves into an issue which Americans seem immune to, Christian 
persecution. Within the last year, many eyes have been truly opened 
through the people with whom we will speak tonight to the plight of 
Christians around the globe.

<p>

Last week a front-page <i>Washington Times</i> article
told of the tragic life of Robert Hussein.  In 1977 he had a brief
encounter with Christianity while in the United States, and he
decided to learn more by persistent Bible reading.  After much
thought, he accepted Christ as his personal savior.  Two years
ago, he publicly called himself a Christian and began witnessing
in his Islamic-run homeland.  Since then, Mr. Hussein has been
rejected by his family, including his two small children, arrested,
and threatened with death.  But his story is not unique, and you
will hear more about these tragedies and what is being done to
save these lives later in the show.

<p>

But, first, those of you watching the show are going to witness 
some Family Research Council history in the making.  Still under 
construction, a bit of FRC's future was taped just yesterday so 
<i>Straight Talk</i> viewers could get the inside scoop from Doug 
Werk, Vice President for Administration.

<p>

Thanks to the generosity of two Michigan families, FRC will go
a new direction later this year.  To learn more, let's go Behind
the Headlines.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, a lot of people may wonder why we are standing here 
in front of the National Museum of American Art.  But this is a very
exciting location for Family Research Council's future, and you
as the Vice President for Administration have really been working
on a dream to make something happen.  Could you tell us why we
are here at G and Eighth Street?

<p>

MR. WERK: 801 G Street, Kristi, and you are absolutely right.  It really 
is a dream come true for us at Family Research Council, because we are 
in need of a new home, and this is where our new home is going to be. We 
are going to be the primary tenants of a building that I am going
to tell you about in just a few minutes.

<p>

But I want to point out why this particular place is so important, this 
particular area. Not only is this National Museum of Art a beautiful 
edifice, but over here you have the Martin Luther King Library, which is
important to the entire Washington, D.C., area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's a very big research library.

<p>

MR. WERK: Oh, it is, and a lot is accomplished there for this city.

<p>

On the opposite corner, cater-cornered in back of this new construction 
here, will be the home of the Secret Service, where we will have 2,900 
Secret Service agents patrolling this area.

<p>

You see that large building down at the end of the block there with the 
glass walkover. That's a large office complex, and there is also a huge 
shopping center there.

<p>

This is an historic church right there with that dome on
it.  This is the Baptist church of downtown Washington, D.C.,
Calvary Baptist Church, which happens to house the Young Life
for the District of Columbia.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of our viewers are involved in Young Life, and that's 
an exciting organization.

<p>

MR. WERK:  It really is.  Chinatown, of course, is on the back
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One block over and there you are.

<p>

MR. WERK: One block and there you are.

<p>

But I think, also, we should point out that these large cranes over 
here are preparing the hole for the new sports arena complex. And so, 
right around the corner and down the block will be the brand new sports 
arena.  And so it is an exciting area and an exciting time for us as we 
prepare for our new home.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Take us through that building. We've got six floors, Doug. 
Maybe you could just run through what is going to be located on each 
floor, more or less, and then we are going to get to go see the site a 
little bit closer up.

<p>

MR. WERK:  There are a couple of things that I want to point out.
First of all, we could only go up so high.  We could only build
a building as tall as the National Museum of Art.  And so that's
the reason for the six floors.

<p>

Also, we had to put a certain amount of space into a museum. So the 
bottom floor is going to be all public-access area. On the right-hand 
side as you enter the building from G Street, we will have a museum, we 
will have some history not only of our country but history of the Family 
Research Council. We will have a bookstore there where folks can come 
and pick up materials that we produce, as well as outside materials.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are some exciting things for kids to do there,
too, with computers.

<p>

MR. WERK:  Absolutely.  We'll have some interactive computers that 
the kids and all family members can use.

<p>

The second floor will be where the administrative group will have its 
offices. On the third floor we will have our resource development 
group. The fourth floor will be our executive wing, where Gary Bauer
will be housed, and also, we will be able to have our board of
directors' meetings in a very large conference room.

<p>

The fifth floor is policy group, and a lot of the research and analysis
work will be done on the fifth floor. And the sixth floor is kind
of an area where --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To be announced.

<p>

MR. WERK: To be announced.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are here on the actual site right now with Andy 
Busey(?), who is our project superintendent kind of managing the site, 
and I know Doug has said great things about you. How long does a 
six-floor building like this -- we've got one level of parking -- how 
long does something like this normally take?

<p>

MR. BUSEY: Generally about a year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: About a year. So our project -- how are we doing on our time
frame?

<p>

MR. BUSEY: Oh, we're doing pretty good.  We are going to
be right in there, a little bit less than that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, it's exciting.  Andy, thanks so much, and we're going 
to look forward to seeing the building.

<p>

MR. BUSEY: All right. Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So, Doug, we are on the fourth floor, which
is as high as they would like us to go and still be safe.

<p>

Well, Doug, we are standing in a building that has represented your
passion and your time and really a life's work, in a way.  What
are you most looking forward to?

<p>

MR. WERK: I think I am looking forward to the day when we can cut the 
ribbon and actually take possession and see what God has for us here in 
Washington to further the work that we do.  That's going to be exciting 
for me. It's going to be the culmination of a lot of earnest, hard 
effort, and I am excited to see the excitement of our people as we 
move over here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And for our friends and supporters from
across the country who are going to be seeing this segment, when
can they come to Washington and see this building that you have
been working on?

<p>

MR. WERK:  I am hopeful that we will move in sometime in the first 
two weeks of November, and shortly after that, we are going to have 
a ribbon-cutting for our staff and invited guests.  Then we are going to 
have an open house, and we are going to invite any and all that would 
want to see our home, not only in the District but from across the 
country. So that is going to be fun to do, probably before the end of 
the year and the winter sets in again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, when they do, I hope that our friends and supporters 
take the time to write to Doug Werk and let him know what a great job he 
has done. Thanks so much for being with us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

MR. WERK:  Thanks for having me, Kristi. Appreciate it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares with you a man who courageously raised his voice for those who 
have no voices of their own as they suffered persecution for their 
faith. Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Every week, millions of Americans put on their Sunday 
best and attend the church service of their choice, whether it be 
Catholic, Protestant, Episcopal, Baptist, or any other denomination. 
For the many Americans who walk up those church steps or sit in a 
synagogue pew or conduct weekly Bible studies in their homes, it can 
be easy to take for granted the freedom to worship that we share with 
our countrymen.

<p>

Only recently in cases such as school prayer have Americans even
questioned their religious liberty.  Yet, throughout the world,
millions of people daily risk their lives by taking a stand for
their belief in Jesus Christ.  Persecution, including torture,
slavery, exile, and death, tests the faith of those who refuse
to deny their savior, and their stories are told in headlines
from the <i>New York Times</i> to church bulletins.

<p>

In Sudan alone, 1.5 million people died at the hands of Islamic rulers, 
and at least 25,000 children, some as young as six years old, have 
been documented as being sold into slavery.  These outrageous acts of 
persecution sweep across the continents, from the Middle East to Thailand,
to Africa, to China.

<p>

Recently the Clinton Administration has been criticized for ignoring 
these atrocities while conducting business as usual with those who 
perform them.  In testimony before the House International Relations 
Subcommittee earlier this year, witnesses presented a cry for help 
for the lives of those suffering and for U.S. involvement in stopping 
the slaughter.

<p>

[Congressional testimony segment follows:]

<p>

WITNESS: So far, the U.S, Government has largely turned a deaf ear 
to this rising tide of terrorism and these human rights violations.

<p>

[End of congressional testimony segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yet, today, little has changed.  As government
officials mull over these proceedings and lives continue to be
lost, people of faith consider the words of the psalmist:  &quot;For
your sake, we face death all day long.  We are considered sheep
to be slaughtered.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As we just saw, and as shocking as it may seem, millions 
continue to lose their lives for their faith even today.  To share with 
us an expos&eacute; of these worldwide travesties is Michael Horowitz, a 
senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and director of the Project for 
Civil Justice Reform.  Welcome to the show.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Glad to be here. Where's your helmet, by the way?  You left 
it somewhere.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I left my helmet in the office.

<p>

Michael, I can't think of anyone better to talk to us about what is 
happening to people of faith around the world, and it is ironic that 
that job is distilled almost to one man.  How did you get involved 
with that?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, you have overstated it.  There's a
growing army of people.  It has in a way been easier for me to
do it, and really, to answer your question, I'm a Jew, and it
has been much easier for me, therefore, to blow the whistle, to
prod, to provoke, and to shame Christian leaders into taking the
kind of action they can.

<p>

You know, we have people, like the people
coming on your next segment, who have been the flickering candles
trying to keep this word alive.  My job has been to broadcast
the extraordinary work that they have done, and I have been one
of many in doing it.  But as a Jew, it has been easier in many
ways for me to do it, and for one particular reason.  Christians
around the world today have become the targets of choice for the
thug regimes around the world, the radical Muslim regimes, the
remnant Communist regimes.

<p>

What is going on with Christians, particularly
evangelicals and Catholics, is so similar to what happened with
Jews in Europe as Hitler came to power.  Three things.

<p>

<li>First, the bad guys could demonize them.  They're different. They 
provoke envy, and they're powerless.  And, also, they represent -- 
Christians do -- threats to these thug regimes.  Because of their 
faith, they're beyond the reach of bribes and threats, which is what
these regimes live on.

<p>

<li>Two, the elites -- governments -- don't care.  At our best, our 
government has been indifferent.  Typically, we have been hostile to 
the claims of Christians who have been persecuted.  You know, the
elites in Washington, when they think Christians, they think,
Oh, these are the persecutors.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is how they are described time and time 
again.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Sure. And in Bosnia, a terrible story, just fills all of 
their predispositions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  But the idea that Christians are the victims -- as 
indeed they are, more than any other group in the world, and by orders 
of magnitude, and reigns of terror against them are growing -- is so 
foreign to the way Washington insiders and elites and national media 
tend to think, that we have been hostile to them.

<p>

<li>And, finally, the Christian community has been silent, just as the 
Jewish community was as Hitler began to rise to power.  And I'm not 
going to let that happen as long as I have any voice within me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You said earlier that although the Christians are 
powerless, they are envied in these countries.  Why would they be 
envied?  If they're powerless, if they are merely trying to live 
moral, quiet lives, what provokes envy?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, of course, they are successful to the
extent they are given a chance to be.  They live lives of faith.
They are powerless against mob sentiment whipped up against them.
Within their communities, often you find charges of apostasy
being weighed in against good, popular, successful teachers, successful
businessmen.  It's easy to get your competitor out of business
if you wave and scream, call him a Christian, then get a bunch
of mobs to burn down his home.  And that's what is going on.

<p>

Governments around the world are spending millions to make tapes, 
scurrilous tapes, calling Christians evil, worse than that, and these 
tapes are circulating.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Not unlike the films the Nazi government
made.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Precisely, precisely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Have you been surprised, after what we witnessed in the 
Holocaust -- and it has got to be the most documented event in history, 
the demonization of a race and a faith to the point that they could
justify that kind of mass murder.  But then we see today Christians
in the Sudan being crucified, murdered, sold into slavery.  Are
you surprised that this could happen again, it seems to me very
quickly?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Nothing surprises me on this Earth. When
good men and women remain silent, anything is possible.

<p>

Now, again, we don't have that kind of holocaust that the Jews 
experienced except, as you point out, in Sudan.  It's getting there. 
As Nina will say, as Mr. Jacobson will say, we've got as many as 
30,000 Christian children yanked from their homes by a radical 
Muslim regime and sold into slavery.  That's going on.  And yet 
here's Farrakhan going to the head of Sudan and calling himself a 
great ally and no voice raised against it.

<p>

Well, we've got to raise our voices.  And when we do, as we are now 
beginning to do, as the Christian community is beginning to do, people 
are listening. The <i>Washington Post</i> the other day had an 
extraordinary column entitled &quot;Christians Have Rights, Too.&quot; 
The writer, who is the deputy editor of the editorial page, said that 
we in the <i>Post</i>, in the media, are responsible for not taking 
seriously these kinds of claims, and he said that this was an important
movement.  He called it the most interesting foreign policy issue
of 1996, and he said if the Christian community organizes, it
will make foreign policy harder with Saudi Arabia, with China,
but, he said, lives will be saved. And I think we're going to
save some lives here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a Jewish gentleman, you are correct, your voice rings 
even more resolutely when you speak on these things, and there has 
been a kind of quiet growth of a partnership of Jewish men and women 
of faith with Christian men and women of faith.  You look at the 
Judeo-Christian heritage. It's easy to understand why.  And yet that 
has not been common. Why do you think there has been that quiet 
gathering, and why you particularly?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I think, in the wake of
the Holocaust, the Christian community has understood the price
that always gets paid, ultimately, when there is a kind of religious
bias that goes on.  But there is something else that has happened
that has been so interesting in this case.

<p>

As I began to write about the persecution of Christians, I would be 
greeted with silence from the Christian community, and I would say to 
some of the leaders of the Christian community, &quot;You know, if I 
had written about anti-Semitism going on, you would be overwhelming me 
with phone calls saying, 'How can we help?'&quot;  Because the 
campaign against Soviet anti-Semitism, one of the most successful human 
rights campaigns in recent history, would not have been possible without
the active commitment of the Christian community.  And so I said,
&quot;How can you be so powerful, so caring, so moral, so strong
in your voice when Jews have been involved, as they were in the
Soviet Union, and so silent when your own are at stake?&quot;

<p>

That question cannot really be answered, and I think it has been
one of the things that has moved leaders of the Christian community
to the kind of action they have taken.  Now we have people like
Jim Dobson, Gary.  Chuck Colson has been an extraordinary leader.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A powerful voice.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Richard Land of the Southern Baptists; they have begun 
raising their voices. And the National Association of Evangelicals 
issued an extraordinary statement of conscience on this subject.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more about this in a second. 

<p>

Please join us after the commercial break as we share with you more 
courageous and tragic stories of those standing for their faith. Stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined by people who have witnessed the horrors of 
Christian persecution and are making efforts to save lives around the 
world. I welcome back Michael Horowitz, director of the Project for 
Civil Justice Reform; James Jacobson, president of Christian 
Solidarity International; and Nina Shea, director of Freedom House's 
Puebla Program on Religious Freedom.  Thank you for being with us, 
everyone.

<p>

We were just talking with Michael at the beginning about kind of the 
context in which we have found silence.  But you all certainly have not
been silent, and your voices are being heard more loudly.

<p>

Nina, let's start with you.  Your organization focuses on the kinds
of tangible persecution that occurs.  What have you all witnessed?

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is correct, Kristi.  We have been monitoring and
testifying in Congress, writing about persecution of Christians
in China, in Vietnam and Sudan.  We have sent missions to these
places.  China has one of the largest Christian movements in the
world today, rivaling our own, and they are the most persecuted
in the world in China. China has more Christians in prison than
any other country in the world, and we have cases, for example,
of one man who is an evangelical Protestant who is in prison now
for three years because he, quote, propagated the book of Genesis.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What does that mean?  Because you hear propagation
of the gospel and proselytizing.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  He was simply holding a Bible study session in his home. 
It's called the house church movement. They are underground. They are 
arrested and punished severely if they are caught.  So they are not 
allowed to have their churches.  They meet in their homes and read the 
Bible, they sign hymns.

<p>

Mike Horowitz is absolutely right in saying that
the West has been indifferent to the fate of these people.  Our
own Ambassador Sasser went to China this winter, in February.
I met with him a few days before he went, and he had never even
heard of the house church movement at the time that I met with
him.  That was a couple of days before he left.  Though he was
well briefed on other important human rights issues in China,
he had never heard of the house church movement and knew nothing;
he was totally ignorant about the fact that they are being persecuted.

<p>

We have another person in prison on our case list, in our database,
from China who was simply praying without authorization, was the
charge against him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So what? They have to apply for a permit to pray?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How can you pray with authorization?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  They have to register with a Communist, atheist-controlled 
organization in order to pray.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And then the penalty for that would be prison.
I prayed without the permit.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Prison.  Prison and hard labor. They are forced to work 
virtually as slaves in motorcycle factories, in brick factories, 
for 13 years, 20 years, indefinite sentences, because there is no 
due process in China.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to go to James and hear a little bit 
about the Sudan, but I wanted to touch first on -- it has to be 
frustrating, then, for you, with China, to have most favored nation 
status, to consistently get economic benefits while at the same time we
see huge human rights violations.

<p>

There was actually a cartoon -- I think it was in the <i>Washington 
Post</i> this week -- where it showed Bill Clinton straddling two boats. 
One said &quot;China's Economic Future&quot;; one said &quot;China's 
Human Rights Violations,&quot; and he was doing a little splits, 
trying to hold the two together.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  That's right.  Well, unless and until the Christian
churches raise their voices, human rights is always going to lose
out in the MFN debate, because the commercial interests are intense,
and they are lobbying, and the Christian voices are very weak
at this point.  We must start speaking out for our brethren who
are being persecuted in China and in Sudan and in Vietnam.  We
have a lot of influence in Vietnam, a lot of influence in Saudi
Arabia, where there is not a single Christian church allowed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MS. SHEA: Even our own -- and this is another example of insensitivity 
of the West -- even American citizens are not being defended by our 
government in their right to practice religious freedom.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Saudi Arabia is an interesting example where the 
embassy recently said that they were going to fight the government to 
be sure that pornography was distributed in Saudi Arabia, which was 
against their faith, but they went ahead and shut down the on-base, 
on-embassy church because that was offensive.  An interesting kind of 
decision to make.

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is right, yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sudan, though, I know has been chilling a lot of people 
because prison and torture, these things are real and terrible, and we 
are hearing about crucifixions from Sudan.  What has your organization, 
James, found to be true?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Yes.  Christians around the world need our help,
support, and prayers now more than ever.  We really welcome Mr.
Horowitz and his voice crying out in the wilderness, basically,
on this issue.

<p>

In Sudan, though, the horrors of radical Islam
are really magnified there like never before.  We have a situation
where the government of Sudan is controlled by this radical group
called the National Islamic Front, and anybody that doesn't convert
to their radical branch of Islam is basically -- they must convert
or die.  We have tremendous, incredible stories coming out of
Sudan.  My organization has spent a great deal of time there with
workers in the country doing everything we can to help alleviate
the situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have to think that those workers are in fear for their 
own lives while they are there.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: Absolutely.  They risk their own lives and livelihoods. 
A lot of our co-workers have families, and we have a lot of prayer 
before they go in.  We really emphasize that, prayer protection before
they go into these places.

<p>

But in Sudan we have a situation where, that we know of, about 1.5 
million people have been killed.  We have a situation where there 
are between 5 and 6 million refugees. My organization can confirm 
about 25,000 children that have been taken into slavery.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And when you say taken into slavery, there have been 
some recent articles about sex slaves, labor slaves.  What kind of 
slavery, if you could be, unfortunately, more graphic for our 
viewers?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Yes.  I don't know how graphic I should be for this, 
but you can just imagine.  It is true. The young ladies are taken 
and used as sex slaves, concubines. The young men, they are used as 
things such as human blood banks for the army of the National Islamic 
Front.  Slave branding goes on. Every type of just horrible job, these 
slaves are given.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Mike, you were talking earlier about a lot of people
hear what is happening in Sudan and see some of the Islamic countries
being so brutal and are fearful of some of what that means in
terms of the impact of the Islamic faith.  But you had a point
that you wanted to make on that.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I am so glad you raised it, because what is really 
going on here is an effort by crazy, radical thugs to hijack one of the 
great faiths of the world.  For much of its history, Islam was as 
welcoming of strangers as Judaism and Christianity; in some decades even
more so.  And so what you have are these radical guys using religion
to perpetrate murder and intolerance.  That is what is really
going on.

<p>

One of the most compelling things that has come out
of this effort that we have been making are the voices we have
heard from the moderate Muslims in these countries who are also
targets of death by these thugs, and they say to us, &quot;Thank
God you're raising it.  Create a constituency in America to protect
the weakest, to stand up to these thugs, and we will be protected.
Democracy will be preserved.&quot;

<p>

That is the case always. When thugs want to practice murder and 
death and kill democracy, what they do is pick a vulnerable 
religious community and make them scapegoats and torture them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is an interesting trend.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Stop that; you've stopped the thugs.  And
that is what the Muslims are telling us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nina, I know that you have seen these same kinds of things, 
this horrific abuse of faith to kill those who don't convert.  What are 
you seeing as you look worldwide?  What trends are moving your 
organization?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Well, what we are seeing is, in the aftermath of the
Cold War, Christian persecution coming to the fore, and it is
emerging in the remnant Communist countries.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why do you think that is?  Why the remnant Communist 
countries?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  They are terrified of Christian churches because they have
a transcendent truth.  They do not believe that the Communist
Party and the Communist ideology is their ultimate power.  And
they also resist corruption and bribery and uphold the dignity
of the individual, which is an anathema to Communist ideology.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So a democracy that might be based on faith -- you
know, &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident&quot; -- that
is threatening.

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to hear more about this in a 
second.  I want to come back to that point. When <i>Straight Talk</i> 
returns, we will hear more about efforts to fight global Christian 
persecution and how you can become involved in helping save lives. 
Join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once again tonight's 
guests, who are battling for the lives of those standing for their 
religious faith around the world: Michael Horowitz, James Jacobson, 
and Nina Shea.  Welcome back to the show.

<p>

For people who are connoisseurs of news, which I
must say our viewers really are, when you are looking at the newspaper,
trouble spots come to mind.  I would say we would all agree that
Sudan would seem to be the most egregious example of what is going
on.  But what else?  Where else in the country should people be
watching?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Great swaths of the Middle East and Northern
Africa, in the Muslim world; for example, Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Pakistan, even Egypt, Iraq, Iran.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Very powerful and in the news.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: I would only add here, it's not only the official 
government action.  Often you have, quote, friendly
governments like Pakistan, like Ethiopia, with which I am particularly
familiar, where the government is weak and appeases the radical
terrorists.  And when we are silent here, it means there is only
one squeaky wheel on that issue, and so the terrorists are given
rein.  So Egypt, Pakistan, and Ethiopia are three countries where
the presidents of the countries probably would abhor that kind
of thing and yet where the terror is phenomenal and growing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It has been interesting to see the Clinton Administration
commend the leaders of some of these very countries that seem
to be most appalling, and we are certainly seeing Bill Clinton
right now reach out particularly to China and Asia, and that seems --

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is right.  China and Vietnam are two big abusers
of religious freedom for Christians.

<p>

That brings up another point, which is the insensitivity of the 
administration in certain aspects regarding Christian persecution. 
For example, political asylum. Christians have a very difficult 
time getting political asylum in this country.  We know of a case 
of a Sudanese Christian whose employer was assassinated for his 
faith.  He was told by his bishop to leave the country to save his 
life.  He got here, and he has been in an immigration prison for the 
last three years awaiting deportation. His application was turned 
down because he could not define the doctrine of transubstantiation, 
a doctrine which Catholic priests study for a year in theology school, 
to the satisfaction of an immigration judge.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Think of this, Kristi.  This is a country founded as a 
haven for victims of religious persecution.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: And here we are turning, shutting the gates to Christian
victims of persecution.  You know, the administration has issued
guidelines saying that if somebody has, if a woman has a feminist
complaint, and they are often real, open the doors.  But I once
went to one of the leading immigration lawyers, told her about
a case of my Ethiopian friend whose has been hung upside down
for hours as pastor of the leading secret evangelical church,
had hot oil poured on his feet, had his feet lashed with steel
cables, was arrested after he returned to Ethiopia after years
of exile, told the immigration lawyer about it.  I said, &quot;Can
you get asylum for him?&quot;  She said, &quot;Can he pass through
the eye of a needle?&quot;  That is really what our government
is doing.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  In our organization, we are trying to
get the administration to do something even more basic than immigration
policy, and that is just to recognize that these things are going
on.  They ignore it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. To acknowledge it.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Just to acknowledge it.  We want them to recognize
it and condemn it.

<p>

One of the activities that we have launched into is a national 
petition drive on Sudan.  We just want President
Clinton to speak out on behalf of these persecuted Christians
in Sudan.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You can hear the President talk about
opening the doors for asylum for homosexuals and opening the doors
for asylum possibly for women who face female circumcision, but
not for Christians being crucified.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: That is correct.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  A perfect example of that was at the Beijing Women's
Conference that the United Nations held last summer.  That conference
produced a 127-page document on abuses against women around the
world, and they were all sorts of abuses, everything from environmental
to financial abuses, and so forth, spousal abuse.

<p>

There was not a single mention of chattel slavery in that document. To 
me that would be absolutely the first thing I would put in there, is the
fact that Christian women and girls are being sold into slavery
for as little as $15, the price of two chickens, in Sudan.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And you would think that would be offensive.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: And the First Lady is so outspoken on children's rights 
and children's issues.  Why is she ignoring 25,000 children being enslaved 
in Sudan?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: It is beyond imagination, really.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  But, you know, one of the things -- I am
not even looking for the administration to recognize the problem;
I want the President to live up to promises that his administration
made as our movement first began and then reneged on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And there was pivotal meeting on that.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Yes. We had a great meeting that Nina hosted with 
Christian leaders from around the country. Jim was there.  Major 
Christian leaders of major churches with major ministries.  Gary Bauer 
was, of course, there.

<p>

After that movement, the President and the administration made 
two commitments:  one, that they would appoint an advisor to the 
President for religious persecution, with real power to
investigate and report; and, two, that he would make a speech
to the National Association of Evangelicals on the subject.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Two rather simple things.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Yes. After the president of the National Association was 
called into the Oval Office to speak with the President, who said, 
&quot;I'd like to do it,&quot; two weeks later, the NAE got a phone call 
from the White House saying, &quot;You know, we don't think the President
can do it.  There's not enough money in his budget to fly to your
convention in Minneapolis,&quot; said a White House official to
the NAE.

<p>

We want to hold the feet of the President to the fire.
You know, he could have been such a hero, even in political terms,
to the Christian community.  And yet the lobbyists from the State
Department, from Saudi Arabia, from the business-as-usual crowd
in China got to him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Well, he would have been a hero if he had done it, and I 
would have happily participated in helping the President gain credit 
for doing the right thing. He is doing the wrong thing.  We need to
hold his feet to the fire.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes.  There was apparently money to fly to the sticks 
to throw a log in a ditch but not money to fly to talk about 
Christians being sold and murdered.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: To make matters worse, as Nina mentioned earlier, we have 
an ambassador to China who has never heard of the house church movement.
So not only do they not live up to promises, but they send an
ambassador there that has never heard of the house church movement
in China, which is amazing.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Richard Land, who is the director of the Christian 
Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Church, in congressional 
testimony, made a striking proposition which Chuck Colson has agreed 
to and many of us are thinking about, and that is, let's have a 
couple of million Christians write letters to the White House saying, 
&quot;Come home, Jim Sasser, to take a little seminar on the house 
church movement.&quot; There may be more evangelical Christians in 
China than there are in the United States today, all underground 
and persecuted.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems likely, doesn't it, Nina?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Yes.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: And let's keep him here until he passes a pop quiz and 
knows what is going on about it.  That would send such a neat signal
to all of the State Department wet-finger-in-the-air crowd.  Ignore
the fate of Christians at your peril, friend.

<p>

So I think we are going to look to do that.  I think we are also 
hoping to organize, and Nina is also going to host a meeting in May to 
see if we can organize a Christian persecution Sunday in this country --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Fascinating. Good idea.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: -- to have thousands of pulpits talking about this on 
some Sunday in September.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On some Sunday in September. You know, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> viewers will have to get an update on that.

<p>

What can people do? I think it is clear that, number one, they could 
write the President. And as we near the end of our segment, what else 
could people do?  They could call you all.  Give your phone number. 
You have this card to talk about this.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: Right. Just give us a call. We have a simple 800 number. 
It is 1-800-323-CARE. That is 1-800-323-2273.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And what will you ask of them?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Well, first of all, we'll put them on our
monthly newsletter mailing list.  They will get a free newsletter
every month that talks about religious oppression around the world,
what they can do about it.  We have a series of petition drives
each month that they can participate in.  We ask people to pray.
That is the most important thing, first of all, is to pray for
persecuted Christians around the world.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nina, you have a phone number as well.  Give the phone 
number and tell us what will happen.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Yes.  Okay.  Our number is 202-296-5101,
and you can call collect, and we will put you on our mailing list
as well, and you will get an urgent action alert every time we
hear of a new case of a Christian either imprisoned or tortured
somewhere or someone who is dying in prison from pneumonia or
some disease, who is in a critical situation.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: I cannot begin to tell you what heroes these people are. 
They have been at it when nobody was listening.  That is the real test 
of a good person.  These are the people who go to heaven, the people
who do it without glory and keep it alive, and it is because of
their effort --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you hope will change, Mike?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I think we want to make this country sensitive
to the fact that there is this persecution going on, because,
you know, the great human rights issue as we enter the 21st century
is religious persecution.  The great hope for the 21st century
for my children, so that it not be as bloody a century as the
20th century was, is that free men and women can worship God.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  If God is alive in the 21st
century, my kids are going to safe.  We weren't so safe in a century
in which God was said to be dead.  So we are really talking about
the freedom of all people, not only Christians, in the effort
to protect these Christians around the world who have become the
targets and the symbols of what freedom is all about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank all my guests and note we had hoped 
to have a pastor on who had suffered persecution and, unfortunately,
could not because he might have been tracked down by the Immigration
Service here and deported, even though he is here saving his very
life by that.

<p>

Thank you, my fine guests.  I hope you will call
or write.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shows you how religious
liberty is being defended in the United States as we hear testimony
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Cathy Cleaver, FRC's Director of Legal Policy,
testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last fall, supporting
an amendment which would prohibit discrimination against religious
expression.  Let's hear what Cathy has to say as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> presents Homefront News.

<p>

</center>

<p>

[Segment from Testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
October 25, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: On behalf of Gary Bauer and the Family Research 
Council, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the 
opportunity to address this distinguished committee on the critical 
issue of religious liberty.  I also want to appreciate, Mr. Chairman, 
your having these hearings. We think they are vital.

<p>

The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent. The Establishment 
Clause was designed to prevent the State from coercing a religious 
belief.  The Free Exercise Clause was designed to prevent the State 
from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.  Thus, the 
religion clauses were designed to work hand in hand to promote 
government neutrality with regard to religion.

<p>

In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly 
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The Court 
has created a false conflict between the religion clauses, which must 
be reconciled in each case, and the Establishment Clause prohibition 
has been the usual victor.

<p>

On October 20, this committee heard testimony from a distinguished
panel of experts who discussed the history of interpretation errors
in First Amendment religious clause jurisprudence and the efforts
to correct those errors by federal statutes.  I will not repeat
this testimony, nor will I refute the argument that nothing need
be done, for the acceptability of that position is increasing
waning.

<p>

I also won't discuss the issue of government-sponsored
or teacher-led prayer, and I think it doesn't serve this debate
to continue to debate that issue.  It is not the issue being promoted
or supported.  It is not being presented to this committee, and
it is not being supported by legal experts who favor an amendment
or a federal statute.  So I think it would do us all well to stop
arguing that; no one is arguing it in earnest.

<p>

I will attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional amendment 
rather than a federal statute and address certain specific concerns 
that have been raised in the public debate.

<p>

The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the Constitution 
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination against 
religious expression and against persons, groups, or organizations in 
access to government benefits or protections on account of the religious 
character or their speech or identity.

<p>

We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather, we 
support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's 
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.

<p>

For purposes of discussion this morning, I will center my comments
on the draft proposal garnering considerable support and presented
to this committee on October 20.  It is the proposal, the second
amendment that Senator Biden read earlier.

<p>

This language would, in effect, say to the government, do not 
discriminate against persons on account of their religious beliefs; 
and to the Supreme Court, do not construe this non-discriminatory 
treatment to be a government establishment of religion.

<p>

The fact that some civil liberty groups call this amendment extreme 
does not make it so. It is a negative mandate upon government: do 
not discriminate and do not misconstrue.  It bestows no new rights; 
it apportions no new responsibilities.

<p>

Some suggest that the Court is coming
around on its own, obviating the need for an amendment.  I would
say that the 5-4 decisions from the Supreme Court do nothing to
advance the notion that things are clear in this area; that we
have statements from Justice Souter saying that the government
need not be neutral toward religion; and other things that do
not suggest that we are through debating this issue.  The Religious
Liberty Amendment could be thought of as a religious amendment.

<p>

In closing, this principle of neutrality is not new; it is the
aim and result of our First Amendment's religion clauses, properly
understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment could restore this
saving principle so that our First Amendment would not be used
to promote the empty state religion of secularism but to promote
true freedom and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth,
to which every American is entitled.

<p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>.  I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> presents two incredible women who 
have committed themselves to making a difference.  Theirs is 
not a random sentiment but a focused love for those children 
who have suffered the most severe physical, emotional, and 
sexual abuse.

<p>

Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson founded 
Childhelp USA more than 20 years ago, and it has become the 
largest national nonprofit child abuse treatment and 
prevention organization.  We had the opportunity to visit 
the Alice C. Tyler Village of Childhelp East to see how 
children's lives are benefitting from Sara and Yvonne's life 
work and the work of Childhelp staff and volunteers from 
across America.  You won't want to miss seeing the 270-acre 
Virginia facility that houses children ranging from 2 years 
old to 12 years old. 

<p>

Like the more than 3 million other children who 
endure abuse each year, these children long for healing, 
both physically and emotionally.  Tonight's show will help 
you understand why Childhelp USA serves as a lifeline to 
suffering children across our nation. 

<p>

In addition to the staff of Childhelp USA, the 
volunteers provide a crucial aspect in the healing of abused 
children, from organizing fund-raising events to purchasing 
a child's birthday gift.  I had the opportunity to talk to 
Connie Olsen, a vice president of the Childhelp USA Board of 
Directors, Chairman of the Alice C. Tyler Village of 
Childhelp East, and wife of someone close to us here at 
Family Research Council, Phil Olsen, Vice President of 
Resource Development. 

<p>

Connie's Childhelp involvement began in California 
and continues here on the East Coast and nationwide.  So let 
us now bring you an inspirational story not often heard in 
the broadcast or print news coverage as we take you Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Connie, you're a national board 
member with Childhelp.  There are a lot of good 
organizations.  This is certainly a phenomenal one. 
But why this one?  Why did you choose it? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I graduated from social work from 
Utah State University, and when I had children I stayed 
home, and when my youngest one was 4 years old, I started 
looking for something outside the home, a charity to get 
involved in, and someone approached me and asked if I wanted 
to be a part of a chapter in Orange County, California, to 
raise funds for an organization called Childhelp USA for 
battered and abused children.

<p>

So I did a little bit of research, found out what 
they did, what they were about, and thought, This is for me. 
This sounds great.  So I took a tour of the Village and 
joined the chapter.  That was in 1981. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So as a person who had not been 
involved full time in working with abused children, what 
impressed you about Childhelp?

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think the thing that impressed me 
the most was the dedication of the volunteers, as well as, 
when I took a tour of the Village, the dedication of the 
childcare workers that worked with the children.  I could 
see that they were really there not because they were 
burdened by what has happened to these children but because 
they really felt there was hope for them, and I was so 
impressed with the process that they used with the children 
to try to heal them.  That is what really impressed me. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As a board member, what are your 
goals for Childhelp? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  The goals that I have as a board 
member are to try to help raise the funds to do the 
necessary treatment that is necessary for the children, from 
the art therapy to the animal therapy to excursions for the 
children, to anything that is needed to help them build 
their self-esteem, get a good education. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You have gotten to see some really 
troubled kids come into this program.  I mean, how would you 
describe the lives that you have seen so that people can 
understand the kind of trauma we are talking about? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  Well, as I think you have probably 
been told, the children that we get at the Village out here, 
their last resort is a psychiatric ward.  So the average age 
of our children right now is age 5 and 6.  They are really 
young.  We have children that have just finished their last 
dose of chemotherapy.  We have children that are 
handicapped. 

<p>

You look at these cute little beings, and you just 
look at the trauma that they have been through already, and 
they are only 5 and 6 years old.  It just touches your heart 
and makes you feel so good.  Even if it is as a volunteer, 
there are just certain things that you can do, whether or 
not to go to a toy store and get different donations for the 
therapy that they have in art or whatever it might be.  But 
the cases are severely abused. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What makes the biggest difference in 
the lives of these kids? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think it is the fact that they 
realize that when they come here that they are not going to 
fail, and the staff knows that they are not going to fail, 
that they are going to work with them until they are 
successful, and they don't accept failure.  And I think that 
that is probably, for many of these children, the first time 
that they have ever gotten that feeling from an adult. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there any special child that 
comes to mind that you labor for here at Childhelp USA? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  When I lived in California, I was a 
special friend to a little 4-year-old girl.  One of the 
other reasons I got involved with Childhelp was that I could 
involve my children, too, in the process.  And so we had 
this little 4-year-old girl who was our special friend, and 
we were able to take her on different excursions away from 
the Village.  So even now, after -- that was in 1984, and 
even now, I think about that little girl and -- she had been 
sexually abused -- and the things that she had gone through. 

<p>

Even as a volunteer, you get tired, and you are 
knocking on doors, and you get people slamming the door in 
your face sometimes, and you are just a volunteer.  But when 
you think back at the children and why you are there, I 
think that is the special thing in your heart that keeps you 
going.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What one thing would you like people 
to know about Childhelp USA?  This is the first time maybe 
they have even heard of it.

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think the most important thing is 
that they really care for children, and they sacrifice and 
do anything that they can do to really make that child feel 
better about themselves, learn forgiveness, and understand 
what happened to them the best way that they can.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Connie, thank you so much for being 
with us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  Thank you for asking me.  This was 
great.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you two women who are dedicated 
to the prevention, treatment, and research of child abuse.
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I had the opportunity to visit a 
wonderful facility where abused children find a home and a 
safe haven, and I also had the chance to meet with two women 
who made it all possible for these abused children to 
receive healing. 

<p>

Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson were 
introduced to the critical need for such an organization 
more than 25 years ago, and <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes 
you on a visit to the East Coast Childhelp USA Village. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA: Childhelp is one of the leading 
organizations fighting child abuse across America.  We deal 
in research, prevention, treatment, and we are trying to 
make a difference in this world and turn these children that 
have been abused into wonderful citizens where they will not 
continue that abuse, that cycle, and we are making great 
headway.

<p>

We are very thrilled that so many people in this 
country now are aware of child abuse, because when we 
started our efforts in that direction, very few people knew 
about it, nor were they really sure that it was happening.  
And so the laws have changed, the issues are at hand, people 
know exactly where to go most of the time for help.  We have 
the National Child Abuse Hot Line, 1-800-4-ACHILD, and 
people can call there for help, whether an adult or a child 
in distress. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you say your goal is to stop 
the cycle of abuse.  So what do you mean by that?  I mean, 
these children come in and they are injured.  What kind of 
cycle would go on? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, we try to turn that child 
around.  The first thing you do is deal with their self-
esteem and build their potential where they know that they 
are a human being that is loved.  They have been told so 
frequently that they're a bad kid.  They're the ones taken 
out of the home, and so they feel that they're the ones that 
have done something wrong.  You have to assure them that 
they are a loved individual that can give back to this 
world.  And once you deal with them in therapy and in 
treatment and give them what they need to become whole 
again, you can turn a child around.  In fact, it is easier 
to turn a child around than it is an adult sometimes; in 
fact, most of the time.  They are like little sponges that 
take to heart the love and the care. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Their self-esteem is just rock-bottom 
when they arrive, and we try to make them feel good 
about themselves, and whatever is their interest, we try to 
work with them and build that, whether it is art or animals 
or whatever; it all plays a part of their self-esteem. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, people need to understand we 
are not talking about children who are having trouble 
reading.  Childhelp deals with a special kind of child.  
What kind of child would be involved in the program? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, these are the most difficult 
cases, children that really can't fit into an ordinary 
foster home, as an example.  In fact, many of them have had 
failed placements, as they call them.  They are like rubber 
balls going from foster home to foster homes because the 
foster homes are not always trained to care for these 
children.  They are not therapists, and these are children 
that are hard-core cases that need to be dealt with in the 
milieu that we have at our villages of Childhelp. 

<p>

The staff is tremendous in these villages.  They 
have to have a lot of care.  They have to have a great deal 
of patience, and they do wonderful work in turning these 
children around, and these are, as you say, not ordinary, 
just the ordinary child-abuse cases, so to speak; these are 
children that really come from mental hospitals quite 
frequently because of their emotional impact or, if they did 
not go to the villages, would end up in a hospital such as 
that.  So they definitely are hard core. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You know, also, a great part of 
the healing is love, and the staff really have a lot of love 
in their heart for these children, and we have had children 
who have arrived and they couldn't walk, they couldn't talk, 
and it's wonderful to see the staff work with these children 
and get them to walk, and maybe they are 2 and 3 years old 
and they're still in diapers.  But it's wonderful the love 
that they give these children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  These are children that have been 
molested, been abused, been beaten, been severely neglected 
and are generally underdeveloped on a multitude of levels? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  There is no question about that. 
There are so many different -- we will say this about every 
child that comes to the Village.  They are all emotionally 
battered, emotionally disturbed.  You would have to be to 
live through what they have been.  But every child is an 
individual.  They have their individual problems, and that 
is why each one has a specific program for them that is 
dealt with in how to deal with the child. 

<p>

We were at a staff meeting this morning looking on 
to see how that twice a day they have these meetings to 
determine how that child is doing and progressing and 
changing the modality of how they're being with that child 
if that child is not responding. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They work with them as an 
individual.  It is wonderful. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  They say that if you even attempt 
fund-raising broadly, that people cannot connect with that, 
but for people who are involved in helping others, that they 
have to do it specifically; that it is better to have 
someone support a specific child, better to have someone 
work for a specific goal.  Is there a child in your mind, or 
one or two children that you think of when you go out to try 
to make it happen, to try to bring in money, to try to work 
it?  Tell me about the children in your minds that you're 
thinking, This is a hard day, but today I'm doing it for 
this child. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  I think that when you break down a 
case, that is always the best, to think of one specific 
child, as you said.  There are 3.1 million cases of child 
abuse that are reported, but for every one reported, there 
are three to four that go unreported.  But when you bring it 
down to focus on one child's problem, you and I can relate 
to that. 

<p>

There are many favorite stories that Yvonne and I 
have.  One little boy had been locked in a closet all his 
life, and he had come to our Village, and we really raised 
him.  This is the Village on the West Coast.  We cared about 
him very, very much, because we had watched him develop from 
a child that could not speak and was so withdrawn.  He had a 
little limp.   

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  He didn't develop right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  His foot turned in because of the 
fact that he had been locked in that closet for so long. 

<p>

But we saw him through actually the time he was 12 
years old, and he was adopted by a minister and his wife.  
And so when we followed his case, to know that he could turn 
out to be even a human being, it was wonderful to see. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  With this same little boy, 
remember, we always have a Christmas program every year, and 
the children put on the play, and he was one of the first 
children at our Village on the West Coast.  We were all 
there together, and we had a couple of people who sing on 
the Lawrence Welk Show come and sing with the children, 
Guy(?) and Rolna(?). 

<p>

They were playing the guitar and singing, and all 
of us, we were baking cookies and singing Christmas carols 
and everything, and this particular little boy went up and 
looked at the guitar and looked up in their faces.  He had 
never heard music before.  And just a simple thing like 
that --  

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  He didn't know where it was coming 
from. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  He didn't know where it was coming 
from, but he had never heard it before, and then he loved 
it.  He thought music was the greatest. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We also had two children that were 
brother and sister that were raised with a group of dogs, 
and they really acted like dogs.  They would bite, they 
would bark.  Our staff had to deal with them on a one-to-one 
basis for a long time and really teach those children 
everything, how to go to the bathroom, how to eat correctly, 
and they were really something when they came to that 
Village.  We saw them shortly after that, and to see them 
just a few months later as an angel in the Christmas 
program --

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Again! 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- it really rewards us, because we 
do work very, very hard every day to bring in the money to 
keep our facilities going, and that is not an easy task. 

<p>

Sometimes when you get so tired, you think, well, 
maybe we should sit back and let someone else do it.  But we 
realize that our hearts are so in it, and we are so 
dedicated, that somehow we can tell the stories first hand, 
what is happening. 

<p>

The reward is to go to the Village, like we are 
here today, and see what is going on with the children and 
know that they are cared for and they are being turned 
around. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing 
child abuse.  Let's hear how Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime 
Fedderson began their efforts to heal broken lives and 
hearts of children.

<p>

You were actresses. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And somehow you got invited to go 
overseas on a trip to look at international children.  How 
did that happen? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, we were actresses in the 
1950s and 1960s, and they interviewed like 500 actresses to 
go overseas to entertain the servicemen, and we were the two 
selected, and they didn't even know we knew each other.  So 
it was meant to be, for sure.  But we went overseas in 1959, 
in October, and we went through one of the worst typhoons in 
the history of Tokyo. 

<p>

We were very young, and we took our little 
dictionaries with us, and we went out to see some of the 
area that had been hit so severely, and when we did, we 
found 11 little children huddled together on the street 
trying to keep warm, and their little hands were cracked and 
bleeding. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It was so cold.  It was horrible, the sight. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, it was so sad. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  They grabbed us and tried to get under our coats --

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They got under our coats. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- to keep warm.  It was really a 
tragedy that we had never seen. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  That is right.  We kept saying, 
"Do you have a <i>mama san</i>, do you have a <i>papa san</i>?" 
And they would say, "No, no," and we learned that these children 
were orphans, and they were Amerasians; they were American-
Japanese children, and they didn't have a home.  And so, 
through our military connections, we were able to place them 
in a home with a wonderful Japanese lady who had already 
taken 10 others off the streets in her home. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And when you went home, you raised 
money to help support those children? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes.  Well, before we left, we were 
<i>mama sans</i> of 21 children instantaneously.   

<p>

But then they started leaving children on the 
doorstep and up the block with notes pinned on them, "For 
the orphanage of mixed blood."  And so it ended up, before 
we came back to the States, we had over 100 children 
completely entrusted in our care, and that is when we came 
back to the States and began International Orphans, Inc., 
and from there we built onto that orphanage and built three 
other orphanages in Japan.  So we had four orphanages in 
Japan before Congress asked if we would do the same thing in 
Vietnam.  And so we went into Vietnam and built five 
orphanages, a hospital for orphans, and a school. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  So that is what we did overseas, 
and our work was kind of completed over there, and then 
Nancy Reagan said, "You know what?  You're looking for a new 
project here in America.  Why don't you look into child 
abuse?"  This was about 25 years ago, and we really hadn't 
read much about it at that time. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We thought she got it wrong. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  So, anyway, we got a small grant 
from Sacramento.  We looked into the problem, and of course, 
we learned that it was the number one killer of infants at 
that time.  Can you believe that, 25 years ago? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  But, you know, before that, we 
organized a Vietnam baby lift and brought the children over 
to this country.  We did not care for those specific 
children in an orphanage site, but each one of those were 
adopted the moment that we took them off the plane.  It was 
then that we went into the child abuse arena and ever since 
have been in that. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And we are standing now at the site 
of what is going to be definitely the premier child abuse 
treatment center in the United States, probably the world.  
I mean, what do you think about in a moment like this? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, I think at one time in our 
life we thought we were going to be actresses and one day 
get married and have children, which we did.  But at the 
time when we found these little children on the streets, we 
thought we were just going to help them and that this was 
why we were selected to go over there, to help these 
precious little ones through the storm and find a home for 
them.  We didn't dream at that particular time that it would 
unfold like it has, and now we are one of the leading 
organizations to help abused and neglected children here in 
America. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  At that time we had no idea that God 
had planned this for our mission in our life, and we are so 
glad that He did, because it means that our life has been 
fulfilled in a glorious way to help these children become 
whole again. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You both are mothers, but in a way 
you probably feel like mothers to a large family. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, absolutely.  And we even tried 
to keep up with the children, the 11 that we found on the 
streets in Japan that caused us to start this whole thing, 
and I guess we are grandmothers and maybe great-grandmothers 
by now with those children. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  It is true. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Because we started so long ago, 37 
years ago.  But it is wonderful to see them turn out well 
and to come back and say that it made a difference in their 
life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you all have been friends for a 
long time. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Almost 40 years. 

<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So how would you describe, each of 
you, the thing that your friend brings to this special task, 
because you know each other better than probably almost 
anyone.  This is a very special task.  What special skills 
-- you know, describe each other.  What are the special 
skills you each bring? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, I think we both have the 
heart for children and the love for children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, Yvonne deals with the 
volunteers a great deal. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Yes, I work a lot with the 
volunteers. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And she has a lot of patience, and 
she deals with them very well.  I do more the business end 
of it.  But she really knows how to handle those chapters 
and do well with them. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  We have a lot of wonderful 
volunteers.  We have chapters on the West Coast, the East 
Coast, down south, up north, and they work very hard for the 
children, and they are special friends to the children, and 
that means an awful lot.  They pay for their child's 
birthday party, and then they contact them all year long, 
and they have their picture.  But it is very nice for the 
volunteer and also for the child that that child has a 
special friend besides the staff that they see every day. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is really important for the 
children, isn't it, giving them other kinds of connections? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right, because sometimes they do 
not have parents involved.  Sometimes they do, but sometimes 
they don't.  So that's their very special person in their 
life.  And when they put on a program, like at Christmas, 
they always look for their special friend, because it's like 
having a parent out there watching them.  So it means a lot. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  In fact, we have had children come 
back to the village at times to tell us and thank us for 
their time, but to tell us about their reflection of those 
years at the Village.  And one the things they recall most 
is about their special friend and that someone was not 
really paid to look after them but wanted to do that and 
cared about them and reached out to them.  So it made a big 
difference in their life. 

<p>

Some of the things that we say to children that 
you think really didn't make a dent and you're not getting 
to them, later in their life, they recall that and will tell 
you that it really did and that they appreciate the time and 
effort and the care that you gave them.  And so that was 
wonderful for us, to be able to see our graduates, so to 
speak, come back and let us know what it meant in their 
life. 

<p>

This one particular little girl I am thinking 
about had a scrapbook in her arms, and she sat down and went 
over the pictures with us, and she said, "These were the 
best years of my life."  And it really did something to us, 
because if those were the best years of her life, then we 
had accomplished something. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Where all are there Childhelp 
organizations and centers? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have a village on each coast, 
east and west, and then we have an advocacy center, a sexual 
abuse advocacy center, in Knoxville, Tennessee, and one that 
was opened in Manhattan, New York, in conjunction with 
Cornell University, and then we have foster homes and group 
homes.  We have survivor programs and, of course, one of the 
main programs is our National Child Abuse Hot Line. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Amazing.  How many calls do you get 
a year? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have reached the capacity of 
300,000 a year.  It's more like between 150,000 to 200,000. 
That was the year that we had <i>Scared Silent</i> with Oprah 
Winfrey, and it was shown at the same time on all three 
networks, and so our phones really went bonkers.  But we are 
hoping to be able to answer more and more calls as we 
expand.

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And as we're on TV more, like this 
show, it really helps, because people hear the number and 
they use the number.  They call.  And we hope that people 
will if they need help. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
continue our discussion with those who are fighting for 
America's abused children.  Join us after this break. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. We are sharing with you 
my visit to Childhelp USA East Coast Village and my 
discussion with Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson, the 
founders of Childhelp. 
	Ironically, in a way, you all both were on the 
<i>Ozzie and Harriet Show</i>, which is the program that people 
often sort of derisively say, "Well, family values people 
want to recreate Ozzie and Harriet.  And yet we have seen 
since those days a rise in child abuse numbers and a 
breakdown in the family that has been unprecedented.  What 
is different today than was true of the time when you all 
were both really television stars? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our American values. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right, the morals. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our values have broken down.  The 
dysfunctional families that you're seeing today.  People are 
not taking time with their children to teach them the right 
pathway in life.  And so we notice a big difference, and we 
think that's why we are having so many cases of our children 
not being cared for, the gangs. 

<p>

You know, when you treat a problem like child 
abuse, you're covering more territory than just that; you 
are really counteracting a lot of social ills all the way 
through the pathway, because you are dealing with juvenile 
delinquency up to the hard-core criminal, because it has 
been proven that the largest percentage of those that are 
incarcerated have been abused as children. 

<p>

So until we change the other spectrum, the other 
funnel, get the money to the child's issue, we are not going 
to see a change.  We have to get to that child to make the 
difference for our future. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Think of how the movies have 
changed and think of how TV has changed.  I know since we 
were in the movies in the 1950s and the 1960s, they are more 
violent, and the sex that is shown, and everything has 
changed.  It influences the children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There are statistics that would say 
that one in three girls and one in five boys will be 
molested.  Do you believe that? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, we definitely believe that.  In 
fact, I think that we heard of some new statistics that have 
just come out that are even larger than those figures.  I 
don't think that America knows yet what we're doing to our 
children.  We have to wake up.  And, yes, it is wonderful 
that we are more aware of what's going on than we did, say, 
10 years ago, or, as you say, when we were in the movie 
industry.   

<p>

But America still has to wake up and really band 
together to make that difference.  And if we don't, then 
we're going to lose America, a lot more than just our 
children.  That's what counts. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You know, when we got involved in 
this 25 years ago, it was kind of kicked under the rug.  It 
was around, child abuse, but we were the first organization 
to do a television special, to make people aware of the 
problem.  And I think people are more aware.  We have 
changed our laws, which we need to still change more, but 
because of that, they are reporting more, and so we are able 
to do something about it, and that is very important. 

<p>

We worked very hard to get to the young children. 
As you know, our ages are from 2 to 12, and we feel that the 
younger we can get them, the sooner that we can turn those 
children around, because the older they get, the more set in 
their ways and the more abuse they have had, so it is harder 
to turn those little lives around. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Help people understand.  When they 
say one in three girls and one in five boys molested before 
18, does that mean parents need to be afraid of actual 
physical, sexual molestation?  I mean, what are we talking 
about?  Is there a range of behaviors? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Training our children to be aware.  
We have a wonderful program right here that is working out 
of our Washington, actually our Virginia office, and that is 
the Good Touch, Bad Touch, training the children when they 
are in grammar school and on up how to deal with that, what 
they should look out for.  And when you educate them, they 
will be aware. 

<p>

We just have not educated our children well 
enough.  We haven't educated our children who have children 
how to be good parents.  And so I think that we are seeing 
somewhat of a change in that direction where we are trying 
to put the emphasis on that, where it belongs. 

<p>

But the age of a child -- you want them to be able 
to trust people, and you want them to be loving and kind.  
However, they have to be aware of strangers and what to do 
and what not to do. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  A lot of times they are not 
strangers, though; they are people they know, and that 
really complicates the problem. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is scary, because I think we 
are all pretty good at telling children, Run away from a man 
who wants you to get in his car. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right.  But when you say it's your 
stepfather or your stepmother or something like that, or 
uncle --  

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Who is the general perpetrator?  
Tell us about them. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Generally, it is someone they know. 
It's either their own parent, their stepparent, neighbors, 
relatives, that type of thing.  And that is scary because, 
naturally, these are the people whom the children do trust. 

<p>

One thing that we should all be aware of is the 
fact that we should listen to our children.  When the 
children often tell you what has happened, let's say if the 
father or stepfather, the perpetrator -- the mother kinds of 
pushes it off or says, "Oh, you're just making it up," 
instead of really listening to what your child has to say.  
And that is an emphasis that we would like to make, to 
listen to your children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Have you found the 1-800 number to 
be a good way to get to some of those children? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, yes. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, absolutely.  That hot line is a 
lifeline.  The thousands of lives that have been saved that 
we know about personally that have been saved through that 
hot line -- you realize how valuable it is.  The children 
really don't know where to go.  They're afraid to tell their 
mother, or they've told their mother or whomever -- their 
father, their teacher -- they haven't listened, they haven't 
responded.  They don't know what else to do. 

<p>

But when they call 1-800-4ACHILD, we will tell 
them what to do, and we have the capability of patching that 
call in where a child does not have to hang up and redial 
another number, let's say in Paducah, Kentucky.  It patches 
them right in to the appropriate authority with that child 
on the line, and then we take care of the situation from 
there with the local, let's say, child protective services, 
sheriff's department, or whatever. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And it's 1-800-2ACHILD for the 
hearing impaired. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Reaching children is one powerful 
audience, but it does seem that having a center so near 
Washington, D.C., gives you an opportunity to reach another 
audience.  Is this Virginia center specifically located to 
talk to some of the men and women in the Nation's Capital? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, actually, Yvonne and I had 
that in mind.  We wanted a place near Washington, because so 
many of the politicians that we had called on prior, they 
wanted to come to the Village on the West Coast to see what 
we were doing, but they couldn't come that far. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And some of them have. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes, many of them have, but many of 
them couldn't.  And so we said it would be nice, where they 
are really setting policies and dealing with the issues, if 
we had a place near Washington that they could come and 
couldn't make too many excuses of why they couldn't be 
there. 

<p>

And so that was our target as far as being near 
Washington, and that is why this is not too far away.  It is 
45 minutes from Dulles Airport, to give you a sample of 
time.  And so we have had politicians here on the spot to 
see how the child abuse is being dealt with from this angle. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I was a police reporter and a court 
reporter and have seen many horrendous cases myself and a 
lot of child-molesting trials, and it is very difficult to 
find a place to send children who have been severely abused. 
Your waiting list has got to be pretty tremendous. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  It is. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It is, but we're building new 
cottages.  There will be one going up for 16 more children 
imminently, and perhaps two.  We are hoping that we will 
receive enough money that we can do two at the same time for 
32 more children.  And so the need for expansion is great.  
We're hoping that people will open their hearts and their 
pocketbooks so that we can do more. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Kristi, we're so excited about this 
because this is our new Village, so to speak.  New cottages 
will be built there. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Great.  It's beautiful! 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Sixteen to a cottage, and it will be 
like a little neighborhood in a cul-de-sac.  So the very 
first cottage will be built now on this specific ground, 
starting either this month or the beginning of next.  So 
we're very excited to see this happening. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You'll have to come back and see 
it after we complete the homes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We will. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And see the children running around -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And this will open up a lot of doors. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  This 
is so needed. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We need more cottages, as you're aware. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, I can imagine. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have beautiful land on which to put it. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is wonderful. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  So we are thrilled that more 
children will be healed right on this spot. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares 
more from Childhelp USA.  We'll also discuss how you can 
become involved in changing the broken lives of abused 
children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.] 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you the 
conclusion of my visit with Childhelp USA founders Sara 
O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson.  You'll hear more about 
why their vision for abused children is so needed and how 
you can become a part of that vision. 

<p>

The best change in law from your perspective was 
the laws to take a child out of the home?  What was the best 
change that took place since you got involved? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  To protect those that came forth to 
say they suspected child abuse, whether it was a teacher, a 
pediatrician, the next-door neighbor.  They were afraid to 
say that because -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Because they could get sued. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- if they went to court and the 
judge would decide, well, the child could have fallen down 
the step and therefore broken his arm, then that person 
could turn around and sue that doctor or whomever, and he 
was not protected in any way.	 

<p>

And so now, you know, in every state you can be 
prosecuted for not, in certain areas, I mean as far as 
teachers are concerned, and pediatricians, et cetera, you 
are mandated by law. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What is the next change that's 
needed in the law? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, there are many changes we 
would like to see in the law.  We would like to see that 
children that are taken out of their home are cared for in a 
better way and that more money would be put in where we had 
more social workers to be able to take care of the children 
and take the children out in the first place, because it's a 
proven fact that now a large percentage of cases they can't 
do anything about; they can't even go to somebody --  

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Have to leave them in the home. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It is just those children who are in 
immediate danger most of the time that can be helped. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  If it's a life-and-death 
situation, then they remove them, but, unfortunately, many 
others need to be removed, also, for a time, anyway.  And we 
are not going around trying to take anyone's children from 
them, but on the other hand, if they need help and if the 
child needs to be removed for a while, then we're for that, 
of course. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We are not protecting our children 
like we should. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a strange situation when it 
comes to molesters, because the research is clear that 
molesters are serial offenders, generally molesting, from 
your research, 117 children per person, and that is very 
chilling to people, as well. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Yes, it is. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What would you tell parents who are 
concerned that something might be happening to their 
children?  What are some danger signs? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, danger signs, you mean of the 
child to -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  For the parent to be aware of.  As 
they look at their child, what might clue a parent in that 
there is something there to be concerned about? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Definite mood changes.  You mean of 
the child themselves? 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Definite mood changes, a child going 
inwardly that maybe had been very much of an extrovert, or 
vice versa.  Any time that a child complains of certain 
hurts on their bodies, when their personalities change, 
their emotions change, which is readily to be seen when 
something like this happens, quite frequently. 

<p>

Many children try to put it out of their minds as 
if it didn't happen and cover it up, which, of course, then 
is a major problem as they grow older.  But usually, if a 
parent knows their child, they will notice a big difference 
in what has happened due to that trauma. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Also, I think, if a child doesn't 
want to be with an uncle or an aunt or someone alone, that 
the parent should think about that and listen to the child, 
because environment there's probably a reason that the child 
doesn't want to verbalize because that person is a relative 
or a friend and they might get in trouble for saying, 
because maybe they've been told, "This is our secret; don't 
you dare tell or I'll do something to your mother or your 
father," or whatever.  So the child has to keep that secret. 

<p>

But they may be trying to tell you something in a 
different way by, "I'd rather not go alone; I don't want to 
go over there to visit so-and-so, and if I do, please don't 
leave me alone with that person."  Think about it. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  I knew of an actual case of a child 
that loved Cub Scouts, and all of a sudden, he didn't want 
to go, and of course, the parents were saying, "This is 
ridiculous.  You're almost through with this term, and if 
you don't want to next time, but you must finish out this 
term now for your Cub Scouting."  This little boy screamed 
and yelled and did not want to go, and it was because the 
Cub master was molesting those children.   

<p>

So I go back to the fact that we have to stop and 
listen to our children and hear what they are saying to us. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right.  That's so important. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As you work with the children here 
at the EastCoast Village -- and there's the West Coast 
Village -- you are hoping to do something in the lives of 
those kids.  What are you hoping to accomplish in the lives 
of children as they leave? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Grow up and be good citizens and 
not abuse their children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And to give them inner light and let 
them express their own potential, their own little 
individual being, to fit into the network of society and let 
them know that they are cared about and loved, and teach 
them to love themselves, as well. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You have to love yourself before 
you can love others. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And a good bit of your program helps 
bring out their passions.  You have painting and riding and 
a variety of things. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  That is very important. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And that was really different from a 
lot of programs which were rather antiseptic and almost 
jail-like.  What was your vision when you were looking at 
something to build for kids? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our vision was that Yvonne and I 
wanted to build a home that would really be homelike.  So we 
visited all around the United States different facilities.  
Now, keep in mind this was almost 20 years ago. And the ones 
that were supposed to be the best -- we went to New York, 
Michigan, all over the place, and we visited, and we were 
horrified.  The rooms for the children were not bright and 
cheerful at all.  Many did not even have bedspreads in the 
rooms or pictures hanging. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They were all white. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  The therapy they talked about, they 
were lucky if they saw a therapist once every three months.  
And so, knowing that, we said, You know, we would like to 
change the thinking, frankly, from our social service field 
and deal with a place that would be where we would want our 
own children to be if they had to be in a place like that. 

<p>

And so every room that we decorated, every program 
that we insisted upon to go in from the beginning, was done 
with that in the back of the mind.  What would it take for 
our child to be rehabilitated and feel loved and nourished 
and in a homelike setting?  And that's where we were coming 
from. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And when my daughter was growing 
up, she used to love to go to the Village and ride the 
horses, and I think she wanted to move there. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So that had to really touch your 
hearts as mothers, then. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To walk around and think of your own 
children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  That's exactly right. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And that was the criteria on which 
we opened our first village of Childhelp in California. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And, you know, it pleases us 
because the children, our children, have never resented the 
time that we have spent with the children at the Village.  
We have always made them feel a part of it.  And now they 
are involved in our work, which really makes us very happy. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.  So for the people that 
are watching and would like to get involved, what can they 
do to help?  What kinds of things are there?  And we are 
obviously going to show a number.  But how do people get 
involved? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, we have chapters and 
auxiliaries affiliated in every place where we are, and 
there are many things volunteers can do, from hands-on 
situations where that is feasible and they are trained 
volunteers.  We can do that.  But, also, there is so much 
work behind the scenes.  So we can use anybody that is 
willing to help, almost. 

<p>

The Special Friends program is very important, 
too, but that only comes about if you are a member.  So we 
are saying to call and we'll find a place, hopefully, for 
that volunteer who wishes to make a difference. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What one word, or couple of words, 
but how would you describe, then, overall, as you look at 
your life's work, how would you describe it? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Busy. 

<p>

[Laughter.] 

<p>

Very rewarding, though. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Extremely fulfilling. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Very. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And I don't know what we would have 
done with our lives without this, even it has consumed our 
life, that we feel that we were brought here for that 
purpose --  

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  No question about that. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:   -- and so we're very pleased that 
we're able to do it. 

<p>

[Segment from Childhelp Dinner Event follows:] 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Childhelp has survived and prospered 
for 37 years just because of people like you who have been 
willing to volunteer their time and to share their money.  
There is nothing that cannot be accomplished when a 
community agrees to roll up its sleeves and do whatever it 
takes to make life better for its children. 

<p>

I want you to know that you're champions.  Every 
single one of you in this room is a champion.  So on behalf 
of the children we serve, I stand here in their stead to say 
thank you. 

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> celebrates Mother's Day just a few
days early.  Mothers are such an influential part of a
child's life and possess the privilege and opportunity to 
shape the lives of little ones.

<p>

We all like to talk about our moms, sometimes 
lovingly, sometimes in frustration, but, unfortunately, in 
our cultural conversation, it is rare that mothers are 
revered and the art of motherhood, honored.  So we think it 
is important that on this special holiday we highlight the 
joys and pains of motherhood.  In fact, I had the chance to 
speak with mothers whose lives are different in a variety of 
ways but all share the experience of motherhood.  Tonight, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you their insights, experiences, and 
wisdom. 

<p>

And since I am not yet a mother, I asked a good 
friend to help me along.  Charmaine Crouse Yoest is a mother 
of two, former Deputy Director of Policy for the Family 
Research Council, a contributing editor for <i>Policy Review</i>, 
the Heritage Foundation magazine, and author of a new book, 
<i>Mother in the Middle</i>.

<p>

Charmaine, thanks for being here with me today. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Thanks, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We probably couldn't tape-record most of our 
conversations.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I am looking forward to hearing more about 
your book, <i>Mother in the Middle</i>, and I wanted to start 
off by saying here once a year we take the time as a culture 
to talk about motherhood, but even recently a lot of the 
stories are very negative.  You know, on Mother's Day we'll 
have stories on why our mothers have ruined our lives. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Why do you think motherhood has been 
so disrespected? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, that was the most fascinating 
thing about the research for this book, is there have been 
several different reasons.  The most current, of course, is 
feminism, and I think that we made a big mistake in the 
women's movement of trying to say that our whole identity 
was going to be wrapped up in the workplace.  And so if you 
go that direction, then motherhood and children becomes an 
impediment.  So I think that is one of the biggest reasons. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be talking more later, but 
first let's hear what blessings motherhood has brought to 
the women with whom I spoke.  They are special women from 
inner-city Washington to the suburbs, and I know that I 
learned a lot, and I hope that you, too, will have the 
chance to learn and relate to their experiences of 
motherhood. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  One thing I would say we get from 
children, it has been my experience, is unconditional love. 
I think sometimes parents see themselves as loving their 
children unconditionally, but for most of us, we chose to be 
parents.  But none of our children chose to be born. 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  I didn't realize what holding 
your own child the first time would be like.  I mean, it 
really for me was like falling in love with somebody, almost 
like when you fall in love with your husband.  It was just 
-- that's an experience that you can't have with somebody 
else in your life except your own child. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  The blessing is first for me, 
and then the daily hard toil is nothing compared to the 
blessings and the joys. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  It's a joy that cannot be explained, 
cannot be felt until you decide that you're going to do it. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  My perspective is not they're a 
burden and they're work, but just that they're a true 
blessing from the Lord, and I just have learned to delight 
in them.  It has really made my life more joyful. 

<p>

MS. VAILES:  When your children come along, you 
see them as blessings, and the burdens hit you afterward. 

<p>

MS. HARDISON:  No amount of money or personal 
affirmation can replace those things of molding young 
children, watching them develop.  It's incredible. 

<p>

MS. ANDERSON:  They'll just come up to you and 
they'll put their little hand in your hand, and there's 
nothing any better than that. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  You get appreciation for the 
little things that make up for the bigger world, and I think 
sometimes you miss that if you're not a mother or not 
involved with children, because children will stop and say, 
"Look, look at the flowers," or, "Look at the bee," "Look at 
the butterfly," and you know, you're just walking past all 
that stuff, and you'll miss it.  And I think they kind of 
bring you back to, you know, where you should be focused. 

<p>

MS. LEE:  You know, there are certainly 
sacrifices, and I could be in a bigger house or wearing 
better clothes or, you know, whatever.  But I don't think 
I'd be any more happy than doing what I'm doing now. 

<p>

MS. SMITH:  Just the little things she's learning; 
it's really a joy, and she's just the delight of my life. 

<p>

MS. THOMAS:  I mean, I'm constantly aware of, oh 
my gosh, what an awesome job, and they're looking at me.  
I'm like their first person that they're really thinking, 
this is how people ought to be.  It's pretty humbling. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  Children love you unconditionally, 
and I think that that's, in my view, a blessing from God, 
because it gives me a different insight into the love of God 
to see this little person who's going to put their arms 
around you regardless of what happens.  Or we've been harsh 
with them, or if they've been disappointed, they still love 
you, and they do that from the beginning, even before they 
learn to speak.  They have ways that they learn of 
expressing their love. 

<p>

The other thing I would say is that children have 
a certain manner of expressing like fresh and creative 
things, and so I try to listen to my children very 
carefully, because there's so much that they say to me that 
I haven't taught them, and so I have an opportunity to learn 
from them, and that's really a blessing. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You all are experienced mothers now. 
But what advice would you have liked to have known before 
you became a mother? 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  Breastfeeding doesn't come naturally. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I mean, just to be intensely practical, nobody 
told me that.  I thought, you know, you're equipped 
biologically to do this; that's the way the Lord intended it 
to happen.  And that, at least in my experience, and I know 
in the experience of a lot of women, that is just not the 
way it happened.  And nobody told me that. 

<p>

I think those first early weeks with your first 
child especially are really critical to your self-esteem as 
a mother, because you're doing it the first time, and those 
kinds of things like breastfeeding and just caring for them, 
you can easily feel like you've gotten in over your head. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  It's something that you never can 
probably hear enough, is that the best-laid plans of 
yourself and how you think that life is going to be gets 
changed, and God has the best-laid plans, and I know most of 
my friends know, and you know, that I have a little girl who 
is three, and she had some mild disability issues, and we 
thought, you know, this would be our special child. 

<p>

We had our son Mack back in October, and he has 
very severe disability issues.  He's at home with us right 
now, on a respirator, and with a variety of physical and 
neurological difficulty. 

<p>

But it is still, with all the responsibility and 
the hardship and challenges, the joy is incredible, and I 
would always tell that to anyone.  No matter what happens 
with your child, no matter how challenging.  The joy is 
incredible. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  I wish I knew or maybe someone had 
told me -- you know, you hear all the time, almost like a 
cliche, that it goes by fast, but I don't think I really 
appreciated that.  My older daughter is six now, and she's 
going to kindergarten, and next year she'll be gone most of 
the day, and as I mentioned earlier, just learning, making 
sure that despite the pressures and whatever stress you 
might have in your life of raising children, that you are 
delighting in your children.  You're looking into their eyes 
and into their faces, and you're taking that time out to 
read them a story or to have the quality time with them that 
can so easily seem to be squeezed out, out of a day, and all 
those things I don't think I really -- it took me a good 
three years of raising my children to learn those lessons, 
and I wish I had known ahead of time. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Because I am an educator, 
it's so funny.  You know, you can teach a sister one year, 
and in two years or the next year you can get a brother, and 
they're so different, and I would say, "How do they come 
from the same house and they're so different?"  And I would 
say that all the time. 

<p>

But when I had my own, I realized how they could 
come.  You know, the gene pool is mixed together and you 
come up with whatever you come up with.  My kids are night 
and day.  But I used to always say, "How do they come from 
the same household?  Do they have the same mother?"  And it 
is so amazing, and people tell you, "Kids are not the same." 
I knew they weren't the same.  I knew that. 

<p>

My father used to always say to us, "Fair is not 
equal," and I never understood that until I became a parent. 
He would always say, "Fair is not equal," and I didn't 
understand what that was until I had my own. 

<p>

MS. THOMAS:  I just find that I really had to 
become a better person myself.  You know, I just thought I 
was a pretty cool kind of person, that I was a pretty 
patient.  It wasn't a natural thing, but I had been working 
on it, and I thought I had that pretty well in order. 

<p>

There's nobody that challenges that like a little 
toddler.  Nobody.  I mean, nobody has made me that mad in my 
lifetime. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

You know, of anything that I have done, and just 
learning to love beyond that, learning just to keep self-
control over that, because, I mean, he's precious to me.  I 
mean, I'd die for him in a heartbeat.  But he's driving me 
nuts.

<p>

And just learning to give that to God, the part 
that I'm just out of control over, and just being the adult 
and stepping back and what do I need to do in this 
situation.  Sometimes it's the discipline, sometime it's 
just an extra hug, that they've been attention-deprived that 
day because you've been running around too much, and that's 
really what the problem is, and it's just really hard to 
discern that and not take it as a personal affront. 

<p>

MS. LEE:  Before I had children, I worked and I 
had this immaculate house and great meals, the kind that Mom 
made every night when you came home.  And now it's like, 
"Well, honey, Spaggetios or hot dogs, which is it?  You got 
a choice." 

[Laughter.]

<p>

It's just really difficult at the end of the day 
to muster that energy to get in there and cook and get the 
house clean, because, you know, you feel better about 
yourself if you look good and your house looks good and your 
husband comes home and goes, "Wow!  I've got a perfect wife 
here.  I've got a perfect wife that's a mom, too."

<p>

So I have really had to just step back and say, 
Okay, I'm not perfect; my house isn't going to be perfect, 
and we're just going to do the best that we know how and be 
happy with that.  So I'm learning to change my level of 
happiness. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  When I had my first child, I went to 
classes and I was sort of soaking up all this advice which 
turned out to be irrelevant. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And so the lessons that I did get, I didn't have 
the experience of wanting to trust them because nobody told 
-- there were some things that happened that nobody told me 
or warned me they would happen.  So I said, well, this is 
such a --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like what?

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  Well, just that, you know, when you 
take the Lamaze class, it's supposed to be so easy and so 
simple to just have this baby. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And it wasn't like that at all.  And I'm saying, 
"What did I take these classes for?"  None of this stuff 
that was supposed to happen in the class happened, and all 
of the stuff that wasn't supposed to happen, did.  And so I 
began then to sort of not trust the official sort of line 
about even how you have a baby.

<p>

But I recognize that each mother is different.
Your bodies are different.  You just sort of bring to that 
process a whole different sort of sets of strengths and 
weaknesses and disabilities, et cetera.  So, so much of it, 
you just have to learn by experience.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about motherhood, and we want 
you to join us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We're celebrating Mother's Day 
in our own unique way, and I am joined by Charmaine Crouse 
Yoest, who is not only a mother of two but also an author 
and national spokesperson on family issues.  She also 
happens to be a very good friend of mine, and I am happy for 
the opportunity to share this special show with her. 

<p>

Well, Charmaine, we just saw the first of three 
segments looking at real-life moms talking about real-life 
problems, and I think the one thing that I was really struck 
by was that nobody said it was easy; everybody just said it 
was worth it.  I think sometimes in the discussion of 
motherhood there's this insinuation that it's going to be 
easy, that you can do it. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Well, you know, I think the thing that 
really struck me, as well, about that is this element of 
surprise.  You're surprised by the fact that it isn't easy, 
but the surprise over the joy.  We heard that over and over 
again with those women, and that is so much what we heard, 
too, doing interviews in the book, is that, you know, 
motherhood has been so devalued in our society that when you 
get into it -- well, you remember when I had my kids.  I had 
the same thing happen to me. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: I was, you know, a little bit hesitant 
about getting to this whole mom thing, and all of a sudden, 
my kids were there, and it was just unbelievable how -- you 
know, nobody can tell you.  That's a cliche, but nobody can 
tell you what it's going to be like ahead of time. 

<p>

I think that that is a natural thing, but in our 
society today it's accentuated, and that turns into being a 
problem when we've got this whole system that is geared 
towards women taking six weeks of leave and then going 
straight back into the work force. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right, and the book that you were 
mentioning was your new book, <i>Mother in the Middle:
Searching for Peace in the Mommy Wars</i>, which I really liked,
because there is a conflict, I think.

<p>

Well, maybe there doesn't have to be, but there 
certainly is a conflict that is described between the fact 
that we as women can achieve many things, and motherhood is 
an aside, as though motherhood is not an area where I 
achieve, or motherhood is not even important for me to 
attempt to achieve, like you do the motherhood thing, yes, 
whatever, maybe, maybe not.  But your career -- you know, 
here's success. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But it's not easy. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Well, I was really struck -- in doing 
the research for the book, we went back and did kind of a 
content study of some of the women's magazines, and one of 
the articles that really jumped out at me that is always in 
my mind was from <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, and they said, "Can You Be 
Somebody and a Mommy Too?"  And the whole idea was, they 
said -- of course, the article was saying yes, you can be 
somebody, but still, that title just continued to stick with 
me, because I thought, you know, that's the subtle message 
that we're sending to the next generation of women, that 
being somebody and being a mommy is not the same thing. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: So I think that's a real problem for women today.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting, because I think 
there is a big generation gap between <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine 
and MTV, Generation X, and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, because 
in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, I think the message is very 
clear, and not just the <i>Journal</i>, not to slam on them, but 
there was an article you and I were commenting on not long 
ago where a woman was commended as being this female worker 
of the year, and she had been cutting deals on a phone while 
she was in labor and was back to work the next day, and she 
got an award for that.

<p>

MS. YOEST: Yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you and I were talking about 
where were her priorities, and then you contrast that with 
Generation X data that says that they're the group of people 
who have most suffered from a lot of broken homes, and most 
say they want to change their work day to accommodate their 
family.  What did you find?

<p>

MS. YOEST:  You know, it's funny.  Since we're 
friends and this is a more informal discussion, I will tell 
you honestly, one thing that has struck me in terms of the 
aftermath of the book is you see some of the -- I go through 
this myself -- you see some of these articles.  There was 
another article in the <i>Journal</i> where they were highlighting 
these really top women, and the whole point of the article, 
Kristi, was that these women had achieved so well because 
they had wonderful time management skills.

<p>

So I walked around for the rest of the day going, 
"Oh, gosh, so that's all it really takes, is great time 
management skills."  But, you know, that's a bogus message 
to be sending to women that if you just manage your time 
correctly, then you're going to be able to hold down a full-
time job and be a perfect mom to your kids.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST:  And it was really kind of comforting 
to me because I was doing an interview later that day with 
another mom who has four children, and she is running a 
business out of her home, and I mentioned this article to 
her, and the conflicted feelings I had had reading it, and 
she just laughed.  She said, "You know, I was one of those 
women.  Everybody looked at me and thought I had it 
together.  I had great time management skills," she said, 
"but I knew that my family, and particularly my kids, were 
suffering." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. Don't you think that -- you 
and I have talked a lot about it -- that we have to expand 
our definition of womanhood?  So I ask you a leading 
question:  Don't you agree with me? 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But we have defined womanhood as we were oppressed 
economically, so now, the real woman today has the best 
resume on the planet, rather than that women are very 
relational, that the husbands and men in their life and 
their families are important; and, significantly, at the 
Family Research Council, we have seen a lot of data	 that 
says most women during the first five years of their 
children's life would like to adjust their work schedule to 
accommodate that, rather than a lot of our federal 
proposals, which are all organized toward getting women back 
to work, because work is what women really want, isn't it? 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And isn't that a little narrow? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, that's what my passion is all 
about with this whole issue, is that <i>Parents</i> magazine just 
ran a study.  They surveyed 18,000 of their readers, and 
they found that only 4 percent of those 18,000 women wanted 
to be holding down a full-time job.  Sixty-one percent of 
them wanted to have a part-time job.

<p>

So I'm looking at this and saying, You know, but 
our federal discussion is all centered on day care, as if 
that is what women want.  And what we found in talking to 
women was that that was not what they wanted, that they were 
really struggling with this issue of how to put their 
children first. 

<p>

Going back to another thing you were talking 
about, in terms of the issue of sacrificing for your 
children, I think one of the difficulties in talking about 
this issue and that I struggled with as I wrote the book is 
that there are no easy answers.  You can't come down and say 
that, okay, here's the perfect work/family balance.  You 
know, we subtitled it, <i>Searching for Peace in the Mommy
Wars</i>, so we kind of wrestled with this question, what is
peace?

<p>

Well, peace is not necessarily that everything 
will be easy.  And in today's society, in our secular 
society, people equate difficulty with something being 
wrong.  Everything should be easy.  But, you know, the truth 
is that children are a sacrifice, and we have to come to 
grips with that. 

<p>

Kind of to tie that a little tangentially into 
another thought is that this has to start with women, 
because if we keep waiting for society --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To fix it. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: -- to revalue women, yes -- but if 
women don't value children, then why should anyone else?  
The problem is that feminism has, for decades now, wanted to 
make it out that men and women were exactly the same.  The 
problem with that is, you can't get away from the fact that 
women do have this intrinsic biological connection to their 
children that, just by force of nature, is different than 
what it is for the man.  And so I look at that and say, 
Okay, as one of the women mentioned, you know, breastfeeding 
is a pretty important component of raising your child.  
That's a vital connection to your child. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And it's hard. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  And it's hard.  And if the mother 
doesn't value that, then why would the father?  Why would 
society? 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right. 

<p>

We're going to talk more about the difficulties 
and challenges of motherhood. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, 
we'll gain more insight into motherhood and the issues 
facing mothers today.  Stay with us. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. With Mother's Day just around 
the corner, tonight we are sharing some real-life motherhood 
experiences.  In fact, let's hear what these mothers had to 
say about some of the hard lessons they have had to teach 
and learn from their children. Join us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What lessons did you find hard to 
teach your children?  What were things that were difficult 
to transfer, values or skills or just the kinds of things 
they need to be the people you wanted them to be? 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Well, I'm still at the 
teaching stage, so what I'll say is, it's so amazing how -- 
because my kids are close in age -- you want them to share, 
and sharing is a big thing.  So you want to teach them to 
share, and I was on this mandate about a year ago.  I'm 
going to teach them to share.  I don't care.  They're going 
to learn to share, and dah-dah-dah-dah, and I gave them all 
these biblical points of why they should share, you know, 
all of the stuff, until I realized they were sharing.  It's 
just that they have to work it out, and if I just kind of 
stay out of it, they will share.  As long as I'm giving them 
love and support, they'll work it out.  But, you know, 
you're so into, when they're two and three, they're going to 
learn to share.  But, eventually, if you live what you 
teach, they'll learn it, so it's kind of easy. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  That's true, what Sabrina is 
saying, and I, too, want to teach the sharing, but I want to 
teach what a strength it is to share and to give, because 
the world is about keep, get, take from whoever else and 
just keep for yourself.  I would like to teach my children 
that that is a position of weakness, and the sharing and 
giving is the real position of strength, and I'm trying to 
work that in. 

<p>

My mother says that it's difficult, but if I 
remind myself that this is a four-year-old, he's not going 
to exhibit this behavior today, it becomes less difficult.  
I feel I'm putting things in that perhaps I'll see in the 
future, and I have to remind myself that he's not going to 
learn it in two minutes, three minutes.  It may be years, 
but soon, I hope that he reflects the kind of behavior I'm 
nurturing now. 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  Loving seems to come naturally to 
children if you give them an environment in which it can 
flourish.  They're just so loving and responsive.  But all 
of the other things, like manners and not screaming, you 
know, just all the things that toddlers learn, are hard, I 
think.  It's hard to shape somebody gently and with respect 
to who they are, so that you don't feel at the end of the 
day that you've kind of beaten them down but that you've 
really nurtured them. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  If it's this kind of challenge when 
they're two and a half -- I've got a three-year-old -- what 
the challenges are that are ahead of us and how much harder 
it's going to be to teach them to respect your body, to 
respect other people, to learn the harder the things they're 
going to be met with in grade school, now -- unfortunately, 
in grade school and middle school -- and I am in awe of that 
responsibility, of getting prepared for that and learning 
what I need to learn to be able to help them through that. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  I think, ideally, as a mom, you 
need to be confident and secure and kind of as if you've 
already done it, but you're really doing it for the first 
time.  So again, with my three, I feel like, as the years 
have gone by, I am getting more confident and secure. 

<p>

But probably the area I struggle a lot with is 
just, as we have been talking, the area of discipline.  I 
think part of that has to do with, you know your own 
boundaries; you know what's appropriate, because I find it 
hard to -- I put off disciplining them, and you see that 
children -- they need it.  You know, they need to learn 
boundaries.  They need to learn what's right and wrong, and 
they need to see that there's consequences. 

<p>

And so I have seemed like I learn this repeating 
lesson that the more I put it off, the harder it is for me 
and the harder it is for them.  As a friend of mine once 
said, you can't as a mom expect to be popular.  You have to 
be willing to be unpopular.  And that's true, because even 
after I have disciplined, I want to run in and have that 
close bonding and friendship, and I need to restrain myself 
and say, you know, let there be distance and let my kids 
learn the hard lessons of life. 

<p>

MS. ANDERSON:  With the discipline and stuff, you 
know, the kids will say to me, "Mom, you know, I don't like 
you very much." 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I'm like, "Well, you know what?  I'm not liking you right now, 
either." 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I'm like, thank God we still love each other, you 
know.  I said, "There's nobody in the world I love more than 
you."  I said, "Sometimes we don't like each other very 
much."  But it's a hard thing to teach them that you still 
love them even in that discipline time and stuff. 

<p>

MS. VAILES:  Other people have a lot to do with 
and a lot to say about how the children come up.  "Don't let 
those children run in the church."  "Don't let them do 
this."  And it's difficult.  Patrice and I know that because 
of our differences, and it makes me reflect on the 
differences that I had with my own mother in raising them. 

<p>

So I'm learning to stay out of things and let her 
handle it.  You know, they're her children.  It's difficult, 
but I'm learning. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that motherhood has 
been severed from womanhood in the discussion of it?  
There's a lot of focus on work, women as people who make 
money, women as people who have a career.  What about focus 
on women as people who bring the next generation to life? 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Well, I personally feel 
that, in the African-American community, mothers generally 
worked, if not full time, at least part time, so I think 
that we were excluded from the discussion, anyway, and now 
that they're including a discussion of working women and 
working mothers and whatever, we are more included in the 
discussion, and I think before we were excluded, and I don't 
think that was an issue for our community, generally, 
because most of us worked.  My mother worked, my grandmother 
worked, her grandmother worked.  I am from a lot of women 
that worked.  I work.  I'm sure my daughters will work. 

<p>

So I think that that whole issue wasn't an issue 
for us, and I think that we're now becoming included.  And 
there are still African-American mothers that don't work and 
stay home with their children, which is wonderful, too.  But 
I think that now we are more included as a community. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you would say most women work. Go ahead. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  I would say that, in terms of how 
womanhood relates to motherhood, one of the most important 
things a woman can do, a mother can do for her children, is 
to have and to convey to them a strong sense of her own 
identity, and it's not like, well, I'm less than or I'm 
subordinate or I'm weak or I don't have any potential.  But 
I think that the mother's sense of herself gets conveyed, if 
not through words, through behavior, to the children, so 
that I would like to think that whether I work or don't 
work, that I live my life in such a way that I'm an 
inspiration and an encouragement to my children to become 
all that they can be. 

<p>

But we live in a society that has peculiar ways of 
sort of pigeonholing mothers and women so that you have this 
role and not that role, and I think that that can really be 
a problem.  Especially in the black community, that's a 
problem.  We get so stereotyped and even demonized and 
denigrated.  You know, well, you're a mother; you're not 
this and you're not that. 

<p>

My perspective is that whatever I achieve, 
whatever I accomplish, it is for my children; it's a major 
part of my being there for them as an example, as a role 
model, as an inspiration. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  Yes, I agree with what Cheryl 
says, and somewhere mothering is lost on society.  I think 
there is the physical mothering of having our children and 
nurturing them, and also, there's the spiritual mothering 
for me, and that is the woman that works in her community, 
that is working at school, in the offices, the president of 
a company or whatever.  It's a whole nurturing, bringing to 
birth, giving life to whatever -- babies, careers.  It's a 
whole world of things that today's world doesn't see, 
doesn't grasp. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll 
talk further about motherhood today.  Join us after this 
break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm joined again by 
Charmaine Crouse Yoest, who is helping me, a future mother, 
decipher roles of mothers today in America.  Welcome back, 
Charmaine.

<p>

MS. YOEST: Thanks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  My mother would pay to know when. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But to kind of springboard off the conversation 
that we just saw with the group of mothers, it was 
interesting talking about the fact that mothers are a 
spiritual force and a broader force and have a bigger 
influence than, you know, five minutes with my kids and I'm 
off to make my real impact in the work world.  Did you find 
that in your research? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  You know, that's a real linchpin of 
what I'm thinking about in motherhood here and what we're 
talking about in the book.  It's just that children have 
eternal value, and when our society became more secular, we 
lost that appreciation for anything that has to do with the 
eternal.  And so, as a result, I think that was a huge part 
of the devaluing of motherhood. 

<p>

It was really kind of interesting to me to look 
back to history and to see if we had any kind of model for 
what motherhood could be.  In the early 1800s, mothers were 
put up on a pedestal, they were revered, for precisely the 
reason that she was mentioning, that they had a force in 
society.  The power that they held as the women who were 
raising the next generation of Americans was very deeply 
honored, and they were seen to have influence in the wider 
community, not just within the home. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't it Winston Churchill who said, 
"The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world"? 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And there was a real valuing of the 
impact that women had in the lives of the people around 
them, broader merely than work. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, and we have just lost an 
appreciation for that.  The most moving thing to me, we tell 
in the book the story of Harriet Beecher Stowe.  She was the 
woman who wrote <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, which is partially 
credited with igniting the Civil War.  The genesis of that 
book, she told a friend once, was in the summer when she 
lost her baby son to cholera.  As any mother who has gone 
through that experience, she was so grief-stricken, and 
shortly thereafter, after her son died, she started hearing 
stories about slave mothers who were just viciously ripped 
apart and separated from their children forcibly, never to 
see their children again, sold into slavery.  She just so 
identified with the pain of losing a child that she sat down 
and wrote <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>.

<p>

When I heard that story, I thought, you know, 
that's what motherhood is all about.  Making a difference in 
the larger society, having your own personal experience 
connects you into the wider society at large, and giving 
your actions a motivation that is more important than just 
your small family. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It was interesting, looking at some 
business models lately, I think what was powerful was that 
in a lot of ways a lot of workplaces are structured after a 
masculine role model where it is very linear -- you do this, 
you do that -- where they said that women managers were more 
relational and built teams on the strengths of individuals, 
while men liked to designate and delineate a task and build 
it on the strength of the description or the formula. 

<p>

We have been tempted to say that the formula is 
right and the relationships are wrong, and I think, in a 
broader perspective, women bring to business and to the 
community an appreciation for those relationships that is 
different. 

<p>

I was interested to see some chamber of commerce 
data recently that said that the majority of start-up 
businesses in America today are begun by women looking for 
options and are doing it in niche businesses. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Yes, and in fact, do you know that 
women have a very rate of success with home-based 
businesses?  This is a real growth industry. 

<p>

I was struck, to play back to the last piece, the 
one woman who was saying that she comes from a long line of 
mothers who have worked, and one of the points that we 
really wanted to hammer home in the book is that women have 
always worked.  Work is not a shameful thing. 

<p>

I think that we can sometimes, in this whole 
debate over women and work, from a conservative Christian's 
perspective, sometimes there can be a bondage that women 
feel in that if they need to work or if they are working in 
some way, that that is wrong.  But that is kind of twisting 
a biblical model of work.  It's okay to work.  The point is 
that our children do come first. 

<p>

And so what we are really wanting to bring into 
the public discussion is, if women need income, they don't 
necessarily need a job.  How can we be more creative in 
looking at our society and making it easier for women to 
augment their income through home-based work, through part-
time, through flex-time, through job-sharing?  There are so 
many exciting options out there, particularly with the 
technological age. 

<p>

Debbie, my co-author, and I wrote this book 
together and only got together once over the course of 
writing the book.  We did it all by computer.  And it's 
amazing to me.  It's so exciting, the opportunities that are 
out there. 

<p>

I think it's sad to see women who are struggling 
so hard, wanting to spend more time with their children.  
That's what we heard over and over again from women as we 
talked to them for the book.  And they're not getting any 
support for thinking creatively in the broader society.  All 
you hear women's activists saying is, "Well, women need more 
day care."  I don't think that's what real women are saying. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, women don't want that.

<p>

I was really struck by some day care data recently 
that 50 percent of children under 18 are cared for by their 
mother who is staying at home, and of the remaining 50 
percent, one third of those are cared for by mothers and 
fathers flexing their work schedules so one of them is 
always there; one third of them are cared for in a household 
with extended family, and a very small percentage of that is 
maybe a nanny; and of the remaining one third of that 50 
percent, only that small percentage chose an institutional 
day care setting.

<p>

But the conversation is all as though this is what 
women want -- we want a place to send our children to -- 
when I think that people's patterns are clear that we want 
to keep our children close, even if we need to earn extra 
money. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. That's what so frustrating, 
is that the national debate doesn't reflect the mother in 
the middle, the woman who is struggling and saying, "How can 
I be with my own children?"  That's what troubling to me as 
a public policy person and as a mother, is to see almost 
this train coming down the track.  Even the Republican- 
dominated Governors' Conference called for more day care 
money in the welfare reform bill. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  So I see our public policy discussion 
going an entirely different direction than where I think the 
women of America are going, because I was very encouraged in 
terms of talking to women.  I felt like there is a real 
renaissance of revaluing motherhood across our country, of 
women saying, "I'm going to draw a line in the sand, and 
this is what's important to me, and I'm going to make this 
decision for my family whether I get patronized or not." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Especially, I think, among younger 
mothers, and we're going to get to talk more about that 
later.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we're going to share 
more from mothers who give their advice to women considering 
having children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. We are continuing our 
celebration of motherhood.  Let's hear some advice from a 
diverse group of mothers to women who are considering having 
children.  Let's see if that biological clock is worth 
listening to.

<p>

Today in America, one in four couples is 
infertile, and the number is growing, and there are a lot of 
factors that are playing into that.  For children up for 
adoption, there are 40 certified, on-a-waiting-list, 
available couples per child. 

<p>

So there are a lot of women who are going to see 
this television show that would like to be where you are, 
would like to have children.  And just thinking about them 
for a second, or people who are just grappling with this -- 
there are a lot of women who don't have children -- my 
husband and I, we don't have children yet -- here on 
Mother's Day, what are your thoughts for those women out 
there who wish that they were among you? 

<p>

MS. LEE:  I try to tell my friends now that are in 
the mid-thirties or early thirties that are putting off 
motherhood -- "Oh, I'll be a mom some day.  We're not ready 
for it yet" -- I say, because we had a very difficult time 
conceiving with our first child, and I just can't tell them 
enough, "Don't wait.  If this is what your heart's desire 
is, don't wait.  The career can wait.  You have a lifetime 
of a career after your child is grown.  But this is the time 
right now where you have the energy, your body is physically 
ready."  I just would advise them to go ahead and get going 
on it, put the priorities first.

<p>

MS. VAILES: I was very happy to have my children.
I guess the one thing that I would like to stress is being 
there for them and being open to hearing what they have to 
say.  I used to say that the Lord blessed me because I don't 
show my panic; it comes much later.  So my children could 
tell me anything.  It's the communication that helped me 
learn, helped me grow, helped me become more flexible.   

<p>

It got to the place that they used to tell their 
friends, "You need to talk to my mother," about problems or 
whatever was going on with them when they saw things that 
needed to be changed.  And they would come to me with 
everything.  So it's very easy, now that they are adults, to 
have open communication. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  For me, having been a public health 
nurse -- and I have had opportunity to travel quite a bit to 
Third World countries -- I have always had a desire to 
adopt, and as you talk about the statistics, I would 
encourage people that there is something you won't have, 
having your own, and yet there are other special things you 
will have if you're able to adopt.  And that is something 
that I still hope, in the future, that we might be able to 
do even though we have been able to have our own, because 
the world is a needy place.  There are needy kids out there, 
and it just takes a little bit of love.  You've got people 
here that desperately want children and children here that 
desperately need homes. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS: Women that don't have 
children, they need to pray to see if that's what God wants 
them to do, because God's wishes are different for everyone, 
and there might be a role for you as an extended family 
person that might be much needed in comparison to you 
raising your own, and you have to pray about that. 

<p>

I know that I prayed before I started having my 
children, because if you met me about five years ago, you'd 
say, "She's having kids?" 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So I was like, mmm, I don't know if I want to do 
that.  So you have to pray and you have to wait and see what 
His answer is. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  You don't know what's down the road 
for you when you start trying.  Maybe you conceive 
instantly, and that's great, because so many of us don't 
have that luxury, and what a nice surprise to find that out. 
Otherwise, you may find out you've got some difficulties and 
you need the time to work through it, and you can't do that 
when you're 38.  You don't have that much time. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  I would have missed -- how do 
I say this? -- the whole world of mothering if I didn't have 
children, because for me there was all this mothering that 
needed its connection or its contact, and it's all of what 
they have said and just a whole lot of other things in me, 
and I needed to make contact with that that needed my 
mothering, and I would have missed all of that without 
children, and it's all of your teaching and your learning, 
the prayerfulness, the growing up, just everything that you 
bring to that need, your purpose to that need, and that's 
what I would have missed, and I am glad I had the blessing 
to connect.                                                   

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  You have to love children.  I mean, 
that's the most important thing that you do as a mother, is 
to love them.  I mean, that's your job, that's your 
responsibility, that's your basic obligation, is to love 
them, to lead them; that is, to give them some sense of 
direction, some sense of boundary, some sense of discipline, 
some sense of orientation when they lose their way, to lead 
them; that is, to be the parent, be the adult, at least as 
long as they are needing that; also, to listen to them. 

<p>

There are so many children whose behavior 
indicates that they don't have anybody to listen to them or 
who will listen respectfully to what they have to say and 
will sort of give them a sense of self-esteem and of their 
own worth by saying, "Well, you're important.  I'm going to 
listen to you.  You have something to say."  Or, "I'm 
interested in how your day was, or what your ideas and your 
thoughts are."

<p>

This is important, this listening, because I think 
that the more we invest in listening to our children, the 
more we kind of help them to become socialized and to just 
realize, well, I'm an important person.  I have something to 
contribute, something to say.

<p>

And then the last thing is to learn from them and 
to recognize that parenting is a learning experience.  Even 
if you have studied developmental psychology, it seems that 
once you have mastered, sort of, as a parent the stage where 
they are, they have a way of leaping to the next stage, and 
then you've got to catch up and say, "Okay, this way of 
dealing with the child has got to grow as parent." 

<p>

This is what I am experiencing as a mother, is 
that I am learning how to be a mother from them as I have 
watched them go through their changes and their growth and 
their development.

<p>

But my commitment, again, my obligation is to stay 
with that process and not to say, "Okay, well, you just go 
ahead; I'm going to stay stuck right here."  And as you are 
probably aware, there are adult parents of adult children 
who get kind of stuck at a particular stage of mothering, 
and then it's really difficult for that adult child, because 
it seems to me that the overall goal and purpose of 
parenting is to do everything you can to prepare that child 
to be an independent, interdependent human being, an adult, 
and not to sort of put them in some sort of perpetual 
childhood because of your own emotional needs or whatever. 

<p>

So the goal is that they can really reach their 
full potential as adults, but this listening, this loving, 
this sort of learning from them and this leading them, for 
me, is what motherhood is about. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the 
break.  Stay with us to hear how you can get more 
information regarding issues affecting you as a mother or a 
father and your family.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I 
would also like to thank Charmaine for all her insights. 

<p>

Charmaine, we just heard a lot of really good 
advice from some moms.  In the little bit of time we have 
left, what advice would you give women searching for peace 
in the mommy wars? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, you know, Kristi, it was really 
inspiring to talk to women who have been so creative in 
finding their own peace.  We have a whole chapter of stories 
we tell of women who have found a situation that really 
works for them. 

<p>

I think the message that we wanted to send women 
home with was that you can make your own life, what you want 
it to be, that there are opportunities out there, and that, 
as women, we need to be aggressively moving into the 21st 
century and staking out the territory and saying this is 
what motherhood of the next millennium is going to look 
like. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: And we can create our own terms and 
our own situation in a creative way that isn't dictated by 
what the activists are saying they think motherhood should 
look like.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, it has been unfortunate, a lot 
of the women who say they're for women are just for big 
resumes and abortion, and you think there's a little more to 
womanhood than that. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: A lot more. Yes, exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to want to have you read 
this book.  If you'd like to receive more information about 
the Family Research Council, tonight's guests, or get a copy 
of Charmaine's book, please call us at 1-800-225-4008. 

<p>

Next week we'll be discussing a chilling issue 
facing us today:  euthanasia.  You won't want to miss this 
potential impact that will come with a contract with death. 
Please join us when <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i> returns. Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight's <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at an issue surrounding our
personal mortality: life, death, and euthanasia.  Do we want
an America in which doctors have the authority to kill
ailing patients?

<p>

Just yesterday, Dr. Jack Kevorkian was acquitted
for the third time of charges involving his role in yet
another death.  These acquittals, along with several liberal
court rulings, are sending a message loud and clear to the
nation's elderly, our disabled, terminally ill, and in fact,
our entire population.  The message:  be healthy or beware.
Who will decide which of us are too sick to take up so-called 
valuable resources, and should we give that authority 
to physicians?  Tonight we will discuss whether euthanasia 
serves the population compassionately or acts as a means of 
coldly eliminating expense and our own humanity.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Robert Knight, FRC's
Director of Cultural Studies.  Bob speaks about an issue 
heatedly discussed just this morning on the House floor, the 
homosexual activist Cherry Jubilee Celebration, a gay-sponsored 
party, that took place in taxpayer-supported federal buildings.

<p>

Yesterday, Steve Gunderson, the gay representative 
from Wisconsin, talked about this issue for an hour on the 
House floor.  Today, Bob Knight gives his insight, and he 
shares an FRC exclusive video about the homosexuals' use --
possibly misuse -- of federal buildings.  Trust me, you will 
not see this on local broadcasts or read about it in many
newspapers. So <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes you Behind the
Headlines.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You know, a lot of
people may have heard in the news about a party called
Cherry Jubilee.  It has been a bit controversial, and in
terms of Behind the Headlines, we would like to understand
what exactly does that mean?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, every spring, we have the 
cherry blossom festival, and the cherry trees bloom around 
the Tidal Basin, and they are beautiful, and increasingly in 
recent years homosexual activists have held various events 
around the city, and they call it the Cherry Jubilee.  This 
year they staged events in two federal buildings, and we got 
wind of this not through some great spy network; they 
advertised it in their publications.

<p>

So we thought, well, this is curious that federal 
buildings, one of them the Andrew W. Mellon Library, which 
is an old august building right on Constitution Avenue 
across from the Smithsonian, was going to be used for a big 
party, an all night long party, and then there would be a 
recovery brunch -- they call it recovery, I guess from the 
party the night before -- in the Rayburn House Office 
Building, which is the largest office building housing 
congressional offices.  We thought, is there something wrong 
with this picture? We'd better take a closer look.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think people would be very 
surprised that this kind of party would have taken place in 
a taxpayer supported federal office building.  How were the 
homosexual activists able to get access to these rooms?
They are kind of tough to book.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Now we have placed many calls to the 
Andrew Mellon Auditorium and the General Services 
Administration, and they will not return our calls.  I think 
they are starting to circle the wagons about this, because 
people are wondering how could they commandeer these 
premises for a party that really got out of control?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we were taking a look at some of 
the different homosexual literature talking about the Cherry 
Jubilee party, they said that it was a certain kind of 
party.  Could you help us understand what kind of a party 
Cherry Jubilee was?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, that is what caught our 
attention.  In a local publication, they said it would be 
like a circuit party, which is something you will see in New 
York and other major cities in which thousands of homosexual 
men gather and have an all-night party, and usually you will 
see drugs present at parties and sexual acts being 
committed, and just basically an orgy, to not think of a 
better word for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is rather amazing to imagine that 
there were parties in federal office buildings where sex 
acts were taking place.  You know, frankly in Washington, 
DC, that kind of thing has always been very controversial, 
you know, whether it is people jumping in the Tidal Pool or 
different things that people said they did in offices.
Every time it has come up, it has been very controversial.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, and other things.  I wonder if 
you could have a prayer meeting, you know, at the Rayburn 
House Office Building.  Maybe you could, maybe you cannot, 
but I know of at least one instance in which a group was 
denied use of a federal facility.  That was Anthony 
Falzarano's[?] Transformation ex-gay ministry.  He asked the 
Museum of Women in the Arts, a federal building, if he could 
have a conference there, because outside groups can rent 
rooms, and he was just flat-out refused, and he was never 
told why, and I have to suspect it is because of the nature 
of his group.  He helps people out of homosexuality, and 
that is not politically correct.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, Bob, my understanding is there 
is some video of this event.  How did that come about?
Where did that come from?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, we contacted a photographer who 
is famous for getting into events and taking footage, and he 
agreed to go into this event, and he stayed the whole 
evening, and he had a camera, and he went in with a 
companion, and they took shots of each other.  So they were 
just celebrants along with everyone else.  Then he swung the 
camera around and took footage of the dance floor and other 
areas, and some of the footage is so dark you cannot see it, 
but he provided a narration for us and told us, look, I will 
tell you what was really going on in the corners, things you 
do not really want to know about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What surprises you the most about
this kind of activity in a federal building?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I think the lack of oversight by 
Congress and by the Clinton administration as to what is 
going on in the federal buildings.  I mean, these are 
government buildings.  They are paid for with taxpayer 
money.  The stamp of approval of the U.S. government and 
thereby the American people comes about when you stage an 
event in one of these buildings.  The government is saying 
we think this is fine; this is okay.  But, in fact, it is 
not okay.  Our representative Bob Dornan said on the floor 
of the House that this is an outrage that federal buildings 
can be used for events like this, and I hope more comes out 
of this.  I hope they actually have an investigation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is very likely that there will be 
an investigation of this party and of who may have set it up 
and where the federal money may or may not have gone.  What 
is the most likely scenario for bringing this about?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I would think that would be at the 
core of the investigation, how it came about, because 
outside people like us are not getting any help out of the 
government in determining how this was able to happen.  So I 
think we need congressional help to do it, and I hope that 
is something that occurs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Bob, you were able to get some 
videotape of this particular activity.  How did you get that 
tape, and could you explain to us a little bit about what we 
will be seeing?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Okay, yes, I think seeing is believing, and a 
picture is worth 1,000 words.

<p>

[Cherry Jubilee segment follows.]

<p>

NARRATOR:  Washington, DC, the nation's capital.
Every year during April, thousands of tourists come here to 
see the cherry blossoms.  They also come to see Washington's
magnificent architecture and monuments to the nation's
leaders of government, industry, and the arts.

<p>

On the weekend of April 13 and 14, 1996, two 
federal buildings were sites of two celebrations of which 
few Americans were aware.  The Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium 
is named after industrialist and art collector Andrew 
Mellon, who donated much of his fortune to help found the 
National Gallery of Art.  On the afternoon of Saturday, 
April 13, preparations were underway for what was advertised 
in homosexual publications as the Cherry Jubilee Main Event 
Party to be held in the Mellon Auditorium across the street 
from the Smithsonian Museum of American History.

<p>

That evening, the dignified auditorium, which was 
built in 1935 and has played host to presidential events, 
took on a different cast.  It was bathed in colored lights 
to create a rainbow flag, the symbol of the homosexual 
activist movement.  Inside, thousands of half-naked men 
danced and writhed on the main floor of the auditorium.  
Then event, sponsored by two AIDS activist organizations, as 
well as several local businesses, also had support from 
major corporations:  American Airlines, Snapple, American 
Express, Starbucks Coffee, and Miller Beer.  The party 
lasted from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

<p>

Throughout the evening, limousines dropped off 
many of the participants.  As the evening wore on, the 
dancing became more lewd and suggestive, with some dancers 
simulating sexual acts and others shedding clothing.

<p>

Just off the dance floor, at least one couple 
appeared to be having oral sex.  In the darker corners and 
in the restrooms, men met to have sex with one another.  
Restroom stalls were occupied almost continuously with two 
men at a time, and the sounds coming from them indicated 
that cocaine was being snorted and sex acts were occurring.  
Outside, in an alley next door, men disappeared into the 
darkness in pairs.  So many men were using the area, 
security people finally closed it off.  Public urination was 
common, even in front of the building facing Constitution 
Avenue.

<p>

The next day, Cherry Jubilee ended with the 
Capitol Hill Recovery Brunch at the Rayburn House Office 
Building.  Inside the foyer of this historic building which 
houses the offices of many congressmen, drinks were served 
at an open bar while a disk jockey played music.  Cameras 
were forbidden at the event, whose location was arranged by 
openly homosexual Republican congressman Steve Gunderson of 
Wisconsin.

<p>

According to a homosexual publication, the weekend 
events raised $50,000 for two Washington-based AIDS groups:  
Food and Friends and the Whitman-Walker Clinic.  Whitman-Walker 
Clinic, which treats people with AIDS, also hosts 
meetings for gay political activists and promotes such 
causes as lesbian parenting.

<p>

The clinic, which is supposed to discourage 
unhealthy activities such as occurred during the Cherry 
Jubilee party in and around the Mellon Auditorium, 
advertises routinely in the Washington Blade's Lights Out 
section, a supplement that features ads for strip clubs, 
bathhouses, phone sex, prostitution, and orgies, in short, 
the type of unsafe sex that has led to the tragic epidemic 
of AIDS among homosexual men.

<p>

The Cherry Jubilee was not the first time that the 
Andrew Mellon Auditorium has been used for a homosexual 
activist event.  In 1993, during the homosexual march on 
Washington, the auditorium hosted the National S&M Leather 
Fetish Conference.  The event celebrated sadomasochistic sex 
and featured virtually naked men being led around in dog 
collars by their dominant partners.  Pornography and sexual 
paraphernalia was sold, including several publications that 
promote pedophilia, the sexual use of children by adults.
Inside the auditorium, a slide show depicted graphic sexual 
acts.

<p>

SPEAKER: Sadism and masochism. S&M is an 
absolutely wonderful part of, well, sexual life. This
building has the S&M leather fetish contingent for the march 
on Washington.  The S&M Leather coalition of organizations 
from around the country picked up some money, and it is a 
government building.  The Federal Government provided this 
building with just a few applications and permits and some 
money.

<p>

NARRATOR: Americans who have become aware of 
these events have these questions:  how could taxpayer 
supported federal buildings be commandeered by homosexual 
activists for their activities, why did the activists choose 
the federal buildings when they could have rented any number 
of other places to hold these events, and why have political 
leaders done nothing when apprised ahead of time of the 
Cherry Jubilee events in the Rayburn House Office Building 
and the Mellon Auditorium?

<p>

It is time that people knew how their federal
buildings are being used for celebrations of homosexuality,
dangerous sexual activities, and the taking of illicit
drugs.  It is also time to ask why corporations are lending
their good names to this radical agenda and why America's
political leaders are standing by doing nothing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, if people would like to get a
copy of this video and of some of the materials that go with 
it, how could they do that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, they can call our 800 number --
that is 800-225-4008 -- and obtain a copy of the video.  We 
are asking a $7.50 donation just to cover the costs, and 
that is not much for a video, let's face it.  But we did 
incur some expenses in making it, but we are more interested 
in getting it out there so people can see how far the 
homosexual agenda has gone in this city, that they can 
countenance basically an orgy on federal premises and most 
people do not bat an eye.

<p>

It is that bad, folks, and I think this video 
would be a great tool to convince friends who are wavering 
on the issue and think, oh, it is not that big a deal.
Don't worry about it. It's just a matter of tolerance.
Well, if it were just a matter of tolerance, it would be
simple, but it is not.  We are talking about people who are
trying to commandeer governmental power, governmental
buildings, and basically force the homosexual agenda on the
rest of us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being with us on 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, thanks for having me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break,
<i>Straight Talk</i> speaks to those fighting against the
legalization of euthanasia.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape segment follows.]

<p>

NARRATOR: A new pro-life movement is quickly
emerging across the nation. These cries for life not only 
echo for unborn children who cannot speak for themselves but 
also for the elderly in response to a chilling trend that 
currently is sweeping courtrooms nationwide, the litigation 
of the so-called right to die.  Physician-assisted suicide 
has become the politically correct term for euthanasia, 
which on March 6, 1996, a federal court of appeals ruled a 
constitutional right.

<p>

At present, the very essence of human life and 
existence appears to be at odds with a growing belief that a 
doctor can help a patient die in the name of humanity.  In 
ancient Greece and Rome, patients never knew if their 
doctors would heal them or kill them.  From those troubling 
times emerged the Hippocratic oath in which doctors pledged 
to do no harm.  Are we on a slippery slope to the same fate 
ancient Greeks and Romans faced?

<p>

DR. KEVORKIAN:  The first thing you do is check
the morality of a law, and if it is immoral, you disobey it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I do that.  You pass any law against
assisted suicide and euthanasia and I will disobey it, I
state it openly, because it is immoral medically.

<p>

NARRATOR:  Soon, the right to die could become the 
duty to die.  Patients with high cost health care or lack of 
family support could feel pressured to end their lives 
prematurely out of fear and loneliness.  Masked in the name 
of humanity is a threat too great to be ignored, doctors and 
health care providers literally snuffing out innocent lives 
in the hour of their greatest need for compassion and 
healing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To help explain what euthanasia 
advocates mean when they talk about compassion, I am joined 
by Dr. David Stevens, Executive Director of the Christian 
Medical and Dental Society, who recently testified before 
the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee in opposition to 
euthanasia.  Also joining me is David Morrison, a researcher 
and writer for the Human Life International, which has 
researched euthanasia internationally, and its impact on our 
nation today, and Gracie Hsu, an FRC policy analyst whose 
work deals with the impact of so-called mercy killings.

<p>

Welcome.  It is good to talk to such an esteemed 
group of people.

<p>

Doctor, as our only official doctor here, I guess 
the thing that I would like to ask is, judging from your 
experience in the medical profession in school and the 
reading of the journals and certainly in your professional 
acquaintances, how comfortable are you with your colleagues 
and peers making life and death decisions for other people?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think most doctors are very 
uncomfortable with it.  I think that is why the AMA has come 
out so powerfully against this, which some people doubted 
they would.  This is not about the right to die.  This is 
about the right for doctors to kill.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  And that is taking medicine into a 
whole level than it has ever been before.  It is giving an 
enormous amount of power to doctors to literally decide 
whether people should die or live.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gracie, you have a degree, a 
master's in public health, and did some extensive studies at 
Johns Hopkins.  Where do you see this trend going in terms 
of empowering physicians, not to save life but to kill when 
it is cost-effective?

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, as we all know, two years ago, 
when Clinton came out with his health care reform plan, one 
of the biggest things that we talked about was the rationing 
of health care resources.  There is only so much money to go 
around, and so where is it best suited, and obviously people 
in the latter stages of life who have terminal illnesses use 
a lot more of those health care dollars than anyone else 
does.  But is that to say, then, that they are somehow less 
suitable to receive those monies simply because they would 
die anyway, and I think really that is the crux of this.

<p>

Doctors are so pressured now, because of HMOs and 
because of other constraints with money, to cut their health
care spending, and this is one way that I see the movement
going, and I think that is the most troubling, especially
for doctors, because it is not necessarily their own
decisions any more, but it is the AMA's or it is the HMO
that they work for or some other type of cost containment
kind of structure that is bearing down on them.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think the key thing is this is
dangerous.  It is dangerous for people.  It is dangerous for 
you.  It is dangerous for me.  It is dangerous for my 
mother.  The way this law is being formatted and what they 
are trying to do is that this will be a personal choice 
between the doctor and their patient.  Can you imagine going 
to the hospital to visit your mother who is very ill, and 
you get there and she is not there, and you ask what 
happened?  Well, my doctor, the doctor that has been taking 
care of her, helped her kill herself last night.  She 
thought that she was too much a burden on the family.  She 
thought that the inheritance was being eaten up. She
thought that you were tired of coming to see her, because
you had not come as often. Can you imagine the guilt that 
that is going to bring on people?

<p>

Then, we need to understand something.  All of us 
escaped the abortion issue.  We are here.  We are not going 
to escape this issue.  This issue is going to face every one 
of us personally.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  David, you have been writing about 
that.  I mean, in some ways euthanasia and the discussion on 
physician-assisted suicide is, in your writings, you are 
seeing it as an extension of the abortion issue.  How do you 
see that being connected?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  In the fact that both the recent 
9th Circuit decision and the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision had as 
part of their foundation the notion that people can define 
their own reality, that people can define their own notion 
of what is objectively right and wrong, that human life is 
not kind of a universal standard.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What would the standard be then?  If 
you look at what the 9th Circuit said and the 2nd Circuit 
said, and you were very critical of the thinking in their 
decisions, what would be the standard to decide whether life 
had value?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, people need to go back to the 
universal standard which has been in place for 400 years, 
which is the difference between ordinary and extraordinary 
care, that if, heaven forbid, a person gets cancer and 
begins to die and comes to a point where really all medical 
science has for them is pretty much exhausted, they should 
have an option to say no more extraordinary means, which 
means experimental treatment, whatever, should be used to 
save them.  The disease will take its course, and they 
should be kept comfortable, fed, turned, I mean, all the 
palliative care, but that in terms of having a doctor come 
in and kill them is wrong.

<p>

I mean, what the doctor was saying is absolutely 
true, because the Royal Dutch Medical Society came out 
earlier this year with agreement with the Dutch government 
to back away from physician-assisted suicide in Holland 
because of the doctor stress.  Now they want the situation 
to be where a doctor does not actually do it, that he is 
providing the mechanism for doing it; the person does it 
themselves.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Dave makes a really good 
point in some of his writings in ordinary versus 
extraordinary care that I would like you all to comment on.  
I think one thing that is confusing for people when they 
hear about the so-called right to die is what does that 
mean?  Does that mean I have cancer and I am not going to 
get better and I am merely going to be made comfortable and 
allowed to die?  Is that the right to die?  Because that is 
not what you all are talking about.

<p>

DR. STEVENS: There is a lot of confusion.  I 
think that is one reason that 75 percent of the people in 
the United States right now think that physician-assisted 
suicide is a good thing.  There is so much confusion about 
somebody is going to force me to stay alive against my will, 
and there are laws on the books across this country that 
prevent that from happening.  That is not what we are 
talking about.  What we are talking about is someone helping 
you decide and assisting you in killing yourself, and that 
is a world of difference.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And the thing is, you see, the 
Hemlock Society and all these pro-euthanasia groups that are 
really pro-patient-killing groups, they are coming in and 
making hay off of that confusion.  They are coming in and 
putting a videotape of someone like the guy in Canada, 
Austin Bastable[?], who the Canadian Right to Die Society 
had on DeathNet[?], they had him on the Internet with a 
video and everything, and it was a courageous battle to die.
People look at that and they think, my gosh, that should not
happen to me. Heaven forbid.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they do not understand.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  They do not understand.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to clarify this 
a little further in just a moment.  Join us after the 
commercial break as <i>Straight Talk</i> continues our discussion 
of euthanasia.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. It is hard to believe that 
euthanasia has even made it to our nation's courts, and here 
tonight to explain why is Dr. David Stevens, Executive 
Director of the Christian Medical and Dental Society; David 
Morrison, researcher and writer for Human Life 
International; and Gracie Hsu, an FRC policy analyst.

<p>

Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Gracie, we were talking a little before about the 
pressures, why people would feel a need to have a family 
member killed, and you had a point to make.

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, if we look at abortion as an 
example, what we find is that women, because they have now 
this choice whether to have an abortion or not, we find that 
many fathers of their children say, look, I am not going to 
take care of your child, because you have that choice.  You 
chose to bear this child to full term, and now it is your 
responsibility.  In that same way, we can expect to see a 
diminished quality of care for the elderly in hospices and 
nursing homes everywhere, because they will be saying to 
them, well, you should be taking your own life; why do I 
need to help you?

<p>

We have this whole perverse understanding of 
compassion.  No longer is it to talk somebody out of their 
depression and to make them feel better about themselves and 
to feel better about life; it is, look, you have no life 
worth living, you might as well kill yourself.  I remember 
as a student health advocate at UCLA, we were told that if 
there was somebody who was thinking about committing suicide 
and you felt that their thinking was -- that they had 
actions planned, that you had a requirement to report that 
to the police because their life was worth saving, and it 
was not because of privacy or anything else.  You had to 
breach that barrier, and you had to say that person's life 
was more important than any breach of privacy or
confidentiality that I may have promised that person.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is an interesting philosophical 
shift where before if someone is talking of killing 
themselves, we have a duty as human beings to care for them 
and to talk them out of it and help them understand the 
value their life has, and now, what?  We have a duty to make 
an appointment so that we can point you to the tallest 
building so you can get the job done?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  One of the things that Gracie said, 
one of the things that I wanted to comment on is that 
palliative care, which is caring for people in the last 
stages of life when medical technology for cures has run 
out, is very low or to non-existent in countries that have 
active patient killing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you are saying that in the Netherlands, for 
example --

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Right, in the Netherlands palliative care is no 
where near what it is in the United States, even, or other 
countries in Europe.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Doctor, do you think there are 
physicians that would embrace assisted suicide?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think there are a lot.  Maybe not 
as many as some think, but we only have to look at the 
abortion issue; a little over 2,000 doctors do the vast 
majority of abortions in this country.  I think more will 
get involved in this.

<p>

I think this whole thing is driven by a perversion 
of language.  You know, you talked about suicide.  They use
the word rational suicide.  That is an oxymoron.  There is
no such thing as a rational suicide.  If you are suicidal,
you are not rational.  It is like somebody standing on a
bridge.  You walk up to them, and they explain to you why
they want to kill themselves, and you say, okay, I know it
is hard to jump; let me give you a push.  That is what we
are doing with this issue.  Your doctor will ease it.  It
will not be such a hard decision.  We will make it pleasant,
as you jump.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  The thing is when we as a society 
begin to define death as a good, okay, then it is only 
natural that if we define it as a good, we want to give it 
to other people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now one of the distinctions you make 
in your writings, David, is you say it is understandable 
that at some point a cancer patient, for example, there may 
be nothing else that they can do, and we make them 
comfortable in the death process.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  There may be nothing else that we 
can do to reverse the cancer, that may be true, right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right, and so we make them 
comfortable.  But you make a distinction between medical 
care, that we may be at the end of our medical options, and 
depriving people of water and food.  Why do you make that 
distinction?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Because in my view, depriving 
people of water or food is the same type of the thing as 
patient killing.  It is a slower -- I mean, obviously, there 
can be instances, very limited numbers of instances, where 
to actually give food causes more pain, in which case you 
could make an argument that if you are going to give 
painkilling drugs, you should also withhold food, because it 
has caused the pain, as part of the drugs, but that is not 
the standard.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you see in the medical 
community on that, Doctor?  I think a lot of people -- they 
are afraid that physician-assisted suicide means that if I 
am dying of cancer, my doctor will give me a painkiller so 
that I can proceed in that process.  Does the medical 
community draw lines between ending care and stopping food 
and water?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, there is a lot of debate on 
that issue.  Personally, I think, right along with David, 
that is cruel and unusual punishment.  I mean, we send 
millions overseas to take care of starving children and then 
turn around and starve a relative to death to kill them?  
This was the circuit court ruling in New York.  That is what 
they based -- they said it was discriminatory.  If you are 
willing to do that, then how can you say that you will not 
give someone a handful of pills to kill themselves?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Which is ironic, because we are 
going to justify giving them a handful of pills because we 
are in favor of starvation?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Yes, because we are starving them to 
death. Let's be more humane; let's give them a handful of 
pills.  I mean, this circuitous reasoning that is going on 
in the courts is baffling to me in the profession and, I 
think, a lot of other doctors.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And what I would stress here is 
that each one of these cases is an enormous failure of 
compassion, of real compassion, which is drawing close to 
someone and being with them in their pain, because one of 
the people who sued in the New York case, the 2nd Circuit 
case, was a man dying of HIV/AIDS, and one of the things he 
said in his suit was that my friends have -- my condition 
has progressed to the point that my friends will not come 
visit me.  They say that seeing me gives them nightmares.
So he is going through this terrible experience.  He is
entirely by himself.  His family has forsaken him.  So in
that circumstance, suicide can seem like a much more
appealing prospect.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So instead of us feeling indicted by 
the fact that this gentleman needs love and we are not 
giving him love, we are as a society to feel indicted 
because we do not kill him?  It seems extremely illogical.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  It is not true compassion.  It is false compassion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I wanted to ask you, Doctor, though, 
because one of the reasons why a lot of people are going to 
be talked into killing themselves is going to be money, and 
what do the numbers show us about the costs of our medical 
care at the end of life?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, people say there is not a 
slippery slope on this issue, but I think it is not only 
slippery, I think it is greased in the United States, 
because 50 percent of health care costs occur in the last 
three months of life.  There is going to be enormous 
pressures on doctors, hospitals.  Insurers are going to be 
putting these pressures, the government, to limit cost, and 
because of that, it is going to drive this into new realms, 
not just the patient who is willing to do it, but the 
comatose person, the disabled person, the elderly person, 
and what was the option or choice to die is going to become 
the duty to die.  You have an obligation to society to do 
this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Especially for, I think, the 
comatose patient and some of the people who are not as able 
to speak, we are going to run into a real abortion quandary 
where we are killing our friends and relatives.

<p>

I want to talk about this further.  When <i>Straight
Talk</i> returns, we will share more insights into the effects 
of euthanasia on our nation.  You will not want to miss it.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are delving 
into the topic of euthanasia with Dr. David Stevens, David 
Morrison, and Gracie Hsu.  Welcome back.

<p>

Doctor, you had just given us the chilling figure 
that 50 percent of health care costs normally comes in the 
last 3 months of life, which is going to pressure a lot of 
relatives, not to mention HMOs, into convincing people to 
die.

<p>

Gracie, do you think that the money argument is 
going to play well in the public health field, or will they 
be patient advocates?

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, unfortunately the public health 
industry has been very well known to say that quality of 
life matters much more than the sanctity of human life, and 
so whether it be abortion or euthanasia, they are very much 
in favor of seeing if the quality of life is not there, then 
abortion before they are born and euthanasia after they are 
elderly is a good thing, and unfortunately, the economic 
costs are very large, and they loom greatly in public health 
and in medical circles.

<p>

In fact, in December, when I was with the American 
Medical Association and some of their delegates, talking 
about what are the biggest issues that you see, and I was 
trying to bring to them a pro-life perspective.  They said, 
you know, honestly, the biggest issue right now is economic 
costs and how much it costs to sustain life and especially 
in the last years of care.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But quality of life, I mean, that is 
really in the eye of the beholder sometimes, and I think we 
all -- David, you have written about it, too -- hearken back 
to the quality of life conversations that Nazi Germany had, 
and in the Dr. Kevorkian trial, it has been interesting.  We 
were just talking about that at the break.  The quality of 
life discussion has even infiltrated there.

<p>

Tell us what you saw, Doctor.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, the quality of life discussion 
is all about whether this life is worth living, and that 
means somebody has to make that decision.  Somebody sits 
back, and today it can be one place, and tomorrow it could 
be another group of people, that all of a sudden they do not 
have that quality.

<p>

It was interesting.  Today the prosecutor at the 
Kevorkian trial held up a newspaper from 1933.  Headlines 
blaring said "Suffering to be Ended." That was the Germans 
stating that they were going to begin killing those that 
were disabled, that were retarded, that they were suffering, 
that we were going to relieve their suffering by killing 
them, and we see where that door once it was opened led, and 
I think the same thing is going to happen here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: David, I would like you to address 
that point, because clearly if we start talking about 
quality of life, then we are talking about not the sanctity 
of life, not even -- I mean, it is very much going to be 
subjective.  Who is going to make that decision?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, in Holland, for example, more 
and more it is doctors, but it is also relatives.  The Dutch 
government did a survey or a report on the practice of 
patient killing, or euthanasia, in Holland.  It was called 
the Remalich[?] Report.  The third reason listed for 
involuntary euthanasia, which is where the person involved 
in being killed does not say yes, please or no, don't, or 
whatever; they are just killed -- the third reason is the 
family could not take it any more.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I mean, that is just ridiculous. The family cannot 
take it any more, so we are going to get rid of our problem.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, because when euthanasia came 
into Holland, it came in not even as a law.  It is still 
technically against the law, but there have been a series of 
judicial agreements, arrangements, understandings over time 
which has made the practice of patient killing, in fact, not 
prosecutable, and what has happened is it started out with 
very narrowly defined -- you had to be very sick, you had to 
be terminally ill, almost the last stages, all these 
qualifications.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You had to ask for it.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  You had to ask for it.  Well, it 
has just been broader and broader and broader.  Again, if 
you define it as a good, the tendency is to give it to more 
people.  So now you have people who are merely depressed.  A 
doctor was brought up on charges in Holland last year 
because he had administered -- he killed a patient who had 
been just mentally -- you know, both of her sons had died, 
she was very depressed, and he had killed her, and they 
brought him up on charges, and they acquitted him.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  It is interesting, too.  Another 
most infamous case was a 27-year-old ballet dancer, and she 
had arthritis in her toes and could not dance any longer, 
became depressed, and her doctor helped kill her.  I mean, 
is that all life is worth?  I cannot dance any more, I 
cannot do another vocation, I cannot go help kids in some 
part of the world?  I mean, there is where life has gone, 
and that is where it will go here, if we are not careful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think we have been schizophrenic 
in our thinking about this.  If you think recently about 
Christopher Reeves, for example, who very sadly broke his 
neck not 10 miles from where we are right now, and I think 
has received very positive public response to his very 
courageous fight, and I remember him being interviewed, and 
he said that he was at that point that he wanted to die and 
his wife and his children said we need you, and that was a 
turnaround for him, and I can imagine the same situation 
where, what, the wife and the children say youre expensive?  
I mean, we are really losing the fact that life brings an 
intangible quality, and I fear we will not see a lot of 
those stories if this keeps up.

<p>

DR. STEVENS: I have treated thousands of patients 
that have been terminally ill.  Almost every one of them 
sometime during the course becomes depressed and despondent.  
Do you know they are scared of?  They are scared of two or 
three things.  They are scared of being a burden.  They are 
scared of loss of control.  They are scared of death itself.  
They are scared of pain.  What they are really wanting -- 
they are sitting out there signaling, saying do you still 
care for me?  Do you still love me?  What we are turning to 
is to say, no, you are right, maybe it would be better if 
you were not here.

<p>

What a message we are sending to people.  When 
they need us the most, we turn around and say, now, here is 
a handful of pills, here is a canister of carbon monoxide.  
We have diagnosed the problem right.  I would be the first 
one to say health care in this country is not perfect, okay, 
and it can be done better, especially at the end of life, 
but we may have the right diagnosis, but this is the wrong 
treatment.  We need to deal with the depression.  We need to 
deal with the cost concerns.  We need to deal with a loving 
atmosphere.  We need to deal with pain control.  But we do 
not need to kill the sufferer to eliminate the suffering.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And the thing is, too, that there 
is a witness now.  There is a growing witness, I think, for 
the truth in this, which is coming from Mother Teresas 
whole order, from the Houses of Love she runs for people 
with AIDS around the country.  People do not know that there 
is an organization called LARGE[?], which is a series of 
communities around the world for people who are 
developmentally disabled and people who are not, and they 
all live together, and there are powerful voices there about 
the value of life, the value of living with, quote, unquote, 
a disability.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a slippery slope, isn't it? I
mean, in abortion what we have said is that life is as 
valuable as it is to me.  I have an interesting -- reading 
feminist literature, there was an interesting thing in the 
New York Times Magazine not too long ago -- Gracie and I had 
some long conversations about it -- where the woman came to 
the conclusion after having her own child that it wasn't a
person until she had decided to have the baby and accepted 
its humanity, and until then it was merely a decision, and I 
wonder what kind of leaps of logic we are going to see in 
the end of life.  So you were a person, you were my father, 
until now.  You have a health problem, and so now you are -- 
what? -- not a person.  You are plant life.

<p>

I would like to ask you all in terms of the 
slippery slope, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
and other very radical pro-animal groups have argued that, 
you know, animals have their own sort of humanity, and it 
would be better for us to experiment, for example, on 
comatose patients than it would be for us to ever use animal 
tests.  Do you see this kind of euthanasia discussion 
leading to that, because, again, I think, if you look at 
euthanasia, in Germany that that is exactly what happened in 
the death camps, that we saw experiments on humans.

<p>

We actually do not have a lot of time left. Doctor, let me have 
you answer that.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, I think we are moving to that, 
and all we have to do is look at Kevorkian, you know, the 
physician-assisted suicide poster child.  He back in the 
1960s was going around with an ophthalmoscope and looking 
into people's eyes and retinas as they were dying to try to 
see the exact moment.  He has proposed that we harvest 
organs from prisoners that are going to be killed.  I mean, 
this whole thinking that there is no sacredness to human 
life, we can do whatever we want to people once they are no 
longer declared to be human.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a powerfully dangerous slippery slope.

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares insights from 
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer.  Please stay 
tuned, and thank you to my guests.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. FRC President Gary Bauer had 
the opportunity to speak at the 1996 National Day of Prayer 
event and provided his insight into the current plight of 
our nation and its families. Let's hear what Gary had to 
say as we share some Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER:  For about 10 years now, two-thirds of 
the American people have been saying that America is headed 
in the wrong direction.  They said that when George Bush was 
in the White House and the Democrats controlled the 
Congress, and they are saying it now with Bill Clinton in 
the White House and the Republicans controlling the 
Congress, and I do not believe it has anything to do with 
the ebb and flow of politics or who happens to be sitting in 
the Oval Office.

<p>

I think the American people are pondering the soul 
of America.  I think they are thinking about a mother in 
North Carolina who straps her children in the back seat of a 
car and sends it to the bottom of a lake, or about a family 
in Los Angeles that makes one wrong turn and before they can 
get off that street of killers, their 3-year-old child is 
dead of sniper fire, or the incredible headlines a few weeks 
ago of a 1-month-old baby almost being kicked to death by a 
6-year-old in a robbery, and the politicians read the 
headlines, and they have no idea what to do.

<p>

My friends, there are many, many ways to measure a 
great nation.  You can measure it by the size of its 
economy, the strength of its military, and the gleam of its 
cities, and by those measurements the United States is a 
great, great nation.

<p>

But you can also measure a nation by how many of 
its families are broken, how big its virtue deficit is, how 
many of its children will cry themselves to sleep, and the 
fact of the matter is that tonight in Washington, DC and in 
the suburbs and all over this country, too many of our 
children will cry themselves to sleep, too many children 
without a father's arms to comfort them, too many children 
exploited by drugs or pornography, too many children who 
have bought into the siren song of the culture that says if 
it feels good, do it, and by that measurement, we are in 
danger of becoming something much less than a great nation.

<p>

Now all the politicians are asking why?  What 
happened?  What is the government program we need?  I don't 
think there is a government program.  I don't think there is 
any number of bureaucrats that can make it right.  I believe 
that what happened is that we forgot God, and having 
forgotten God, we have unleashed the hounds of hell on our 
streets and our neighborhoods and our communities, and 
unless we are willing to deal with that, then all the 
politicians in the world will not be able to put America 
back together again.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we will share our conversation
with a true American hero.  Almost 1 year ago, on June 2, 
1995, U.S. Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady's life changed 
forever.  On that June afternoon, Captain O'Grady flew 
his F-16 over hostile Bosnian territory enforcing the 
United Nations no-fly zone, when suddenly an anti-aircraft 
missile hit his plane.  From then, miracle after 
miracle led to his rescue, which occurred almost 6 days 
after Captain O'Grady found himself hiding in hostile 
territory without food or water.

<p>

The successful Marine rescue mission brought 
home a brave new hero, and we will find out how Captain 
O'Grady's experience shaped what he is doing today and 
shapes his future.  You will not want to miss this 
exclusive <i>Straight Talk</i> interview.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Robert Knight, the 
Family Research Council's director of cultural studies.
Bob enlightens us on a crucial social and policy change
which threatens to redefine marriage as we know it now
and have known it since even before recorded history.
The courts in Hawaii are toying with redefining marriage 
to mean two men or two women or fill in the blank,
instead of protecting the relationship at the core of all 
civilized societies, marriage between a man and a woman.

<p>

Bob shares important information regarding the 
ramifications of this change that you probably will not 
hear on the broadcast or print news coverage as we take 
you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You know, it may 
seem strange to a lot of our viewers, but we are actually 
going to have a conversation about what is marriage, and 
why do we even care what it is?  Why are we talking about
marriage today?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it has been forced upon us.
This is not an issue that we raised, because we have been 
for marriage all along and want it to stay the way it is:
the social, legal, spiritual, and economic union of a man 
and a woman.  That is what it has been for centuries.  In 
fact, if you just reduce it to the bringing together of 
the two sexes to form families, that is the way it has 
always been across cultures around the world for 
thousands of years.

<p>

So the only reason we are even discussing it is 
because of a court case in Hawaii.  Three years ago,
three same sex couples sued to get a marriage license.
They were denied by the state of Hawaii because there is 
an opposite sex missing in each couple, and so they took 
their case all the way to the Hawaiian Supreme Court.
That court told the state:  find a compelling interest in 
maintaining this definition of marriage, or we are going 
to legalize homosexual marriage under the state's gay 
rights law.

<p>

So right now that court case is simmering.  It 
is supposed to be heard in August, 1996, and because of 
the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. 
Constitution, if Hawaii legalizes gay marriage -- that is 
an oxymoron -- then all the other states would see their 
laws threatened, because a couple from California or 
Illinois or North Carolina could fly to Honolulu, get a 
bogus marriage certificate, come back and say under the 
Constitution, you have to recognize our license.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, I think we almost have to 
explain that a little further, because that is the clause 
through which all contracts in all of the states are 
accepted, such as drivers' licenses or marriage licenses 
or even business agreements.  Would the full faith and 
credit clause sweep this nationwide?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it would.  There is one little 
-- well, a lot of rays of hope here.  For one thing, 
states are moving very rapidly to protect themselves.  At 
least nine states have enacted laws saying, look, we mean 
by marriage one man and one woman and that is it, and we 
are not going to recognize any licenses from anywhere 
that say otherwise, and this is continuing.  I expect 
more and more states will adopt these kinds of laws.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there precedent for one state 
to say that for us we will restrict agreements from other 
states in certain areas?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, yes.  The Congress had to 
take this up because of child custody proceedings.  There 
were different varying definitions of what a child is and 
that sort of thing.  So Congress stepped in and said, 
well, look, we will amend the U.S. code and make national 
definitions that everybody can use, and that is what is 
happening now at the federal level on the marriage issue.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act, introduced in the 
House and the Senate, does precisely that.  It says that 
no state can be forced to renounce its own definition 
just because another state has taken up a radical 
redefinition, and it also defines marriage as one man/one 
woman for the federal government, which is no small 
thing, unfortunately.  Government is too big.  You are 
talking Social Security, the military, the welfare 
agencies.  The use of the term marriage and spouse is 
everywhere in the federal code.  So this would make a 
major dent in the drive to redefine marriage if the 
entire federal government goes on record as supporting 
the traditional definition of marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It seems obvious, Bob, that the 
Hawaii case could have drastic social consequences, but I 
think the question that most people would really like to 
hear you answer is what does it matter if two men or two 
women decide to go through a legalized ceremony for their 
relationship?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, that is the problem, and that 
is what we hear all the time.  Hey, how are you 
threatened?  Barney Frank says it all the time.  How are 
you threatened if I and a lover live together?  Well, you 
are threatened any time the moral order is shaken by 
activities that are immoral and hurt people.
Homosexuality by its essence hurts people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How does it hurt people?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, because it is a breakdown of 
the moral code.  When sexuality is not channeled into 
marriage -- and we are talking about premarital sex, 
adultery, homosexuality, anything short of marriage -- 
and historical precedents show that it breaks down the 
moral order.  It breaks down the way we live.  It hurts 
the kinship structure.

<p>

Marriage was not invented to oppress 
homosexuals.  It was invented because it is the way to 
form families, and it is the building block of 
civilization, and when you have any sex outside marriage, 
you run the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, 
breaking down support for marriage within the culture, 
which has already happened in this country with no-fault 
divorce and the whole push for premarital sex.  Marriage 
has already been cheapened to the point where now 
homosexual activists think they can deal the final blow 
by expanding the definition so far that marriage will not 
mean anything any more.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the conversation on this 
issue of marriage being redefined for homosexuals has 
surrounded the point that marriage tames men.  So if we 
had marriage for gay men, they would be tamed.  But don't 
women really tame men in the context of a committed 
relationship?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I think women help a lot, because 
men have something else to live for other than their own 
appetites and desires when they have families.  So I 
would not dismiss that out of hand, but the claim that if 
we let homosexuals marry they will suddenly behave 
themselves is bogus.  In areas where they have de facto 
gay marriage, like San Francisco, where they really 
recognize the union, the social pathologies are still 
soaring, and the gays are very clear in their literature 
that what they mean by marriage is different from what 
other people mean.  They have outside relationships.

<p>

Andrew Sullivan, the editor of the <i>New Republic</i>,
said that gay male relationships may even be superior to
marriage, because they understand the need for outside 
sexual contacts.  So they are not even talking about
monogamy.  Furthermore, other gay activists have been
even more candid, like Michelangelo Signarilli[?], who
said we need to get marriage because it is the final tool
to ram through the rest of the homosexual agenda:
teaching homosexuality to children in schools, forcing
businesses to provide benefits to subsidize
homosexuality, the whole gay agenda.  He also said, look,
we want marriage, not to live by society's moral code but 
to help destroy an archaic institution.  I mean, this guy 
is priceless, because he is actually saying out loud what 
the gay activists have been planning all along.  So in 
the name of tolerance, we are supposed to accept 
something that really will destroy marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, on <i>This Week with David
Brinkley</i>, California Attorney General Dan Lundgren made 
an interesting defense of marriage, where he said that 
one reason why we protected marriage, that union of 
man/woman and then the family that came from it, was 
because of the implications for that on social breakdown 
and that increased crime, in particular, was a real 
problem for societies where men and women did not work 
together consistently for the raising of children.  Would 
homosexual marriage of any kind create some kind of 
safety net against crime?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, no, it would do the opposite, 
because it would reduce the support for marriage within 
the cultural and legal codes.  Once you redefine marriage 
so that it is not even the bringing together of the two 
sexes, then the sky is the limit.  You could have three 
people, four people.  Unmarried heterosexual couples have 
piggybacked on the gay rights agenda to demand that they 
be treated the same as married couples.  If that happens, 
then the support for marriage disintegrates, and when 
marriage disintegrates, commitment is lessened.  You do 
not have the ties between the generations.

<p>

I do not think the average person really -- 
well, maybe average people do.  They are smarter than all 
the activists put together.  They know marriage is the 
glue that holds society together.  It ensures kinship 
passing from generation to generation.  We talk of our 
grandparents and our children yet to be, and there is a 
linkage there.

<p>

When sex goes outside marriage, you break that 
linkage, or if it goes into a phony homosexual type 
marriage.  I mean, you do not have that generational 
intimacy and passing on of property, names.  I mean, 
think of what a society would be with widespread so-called 
homosexual marriage.  It would be in utter chaos.
So why would we want to introduce a chaotic element into 
a society that already needs to bolster marriage?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Really at the heart of this 
controversy over redefining marriage is the traumatic 
social change of making children available for adoption 
into households with two men or two women and then the 
very powerful social message that children do not need a 
mother and a father, that as long as two guys care about 
you, or two women, that a whole lot of social 
relationships are insignificant.  Are you concerned about 
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Children are desperate for clues as 
to how to grow up, to be either men or women, and they 
look to both sexes for clues.  Boys look to their dads 
for how to grow up to be men, and they look to their 
mothers and their fathers for how women and men interact, 
how husbands and wives interact, how mothers and fathers 
interact.  They have to learn how to treat the opposite 
sex and be treated by the opposite sex.

<p>

The same for little girls.  You know, without a 
dad, they are not sure how men should be treating women, 
or without a mom -- that is their role model.  That is 
their security in developing their femininity.  If you 
take that away, you are trying to create an artificial 
gender identity by theory basically rather than by 
experience.  So when you have a household in which you 
have mom and dad replaced by just two men or two women, 
you are leaving out such an important element that the 
child knows it.  We are experimenting on children.  This 
is wrong.

<p>

Again, nobody knows this better than single 
parents, who are struggling mightily to try to replace 
that void in the child's life that they know is there, 
and a lot of parents are heroically trying to fill that 
void.  But in a homosexual household, now you are talking 
about having one sex missing entirely and a distorted 
version of sexuality and relationships presented to the 
child on a daily basis.  This is putting children at 
risk.  It is not reasonable to assume this will have no 
impact on children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The homosexual activists have 
talked a lot about the fact that they need to redefine 
marriage under the law so that they can give property 
through wills, so that they can visit loved ones in the 
hospital, but do we really need that kind of huge social 
change to accomplish those two goals?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, most of the activists greatly 
exaggerate any legal problems they already have.  You can 
leave anything you want to anybody in a will.
Homosexuals already do that routinely.  What they want is 
that family should not have an advantage in any legal 
challenge to a will, and to do that you would have to 
devalue family entirely.  You know, children coming out 
of a marriage, even if it is sundered, should have 
certain rights in an inheritance proceeding.  What the 
gay activists are saying is they should not have any more 
standing than, say, a string of gay lovers, and that is 
wrong.

<p>

As far as hospital visitation, that is not a 
federal issue.  It is not even a state issue.  That is 
between the hospital administrators and their patients, 
and there is no reason that gays should seize marriage, 
completely radically redefine it, just to have a change 
in hospital visitation rules.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It seems a bit extreme.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it is the most compelling 
argument they have, that, oh, I can't even visit my lover 
in the hospital; isn't that unfair?  Maybe it is, but you 
do not seize marriage and radically redefine it to 
correct that one problem, if it is a problem.  You know, 
there is a reason family members have been given priority 
in visitation of loved ones.  Friends cannot make the 
same claims that family members can.  The same with 
homosexual lovers.  No matter how close they are, it is 
still not family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, as we take a look at some of 
the serious possible changes in our culture that could 
come from redefining marriage, I think it is interesting 
to remember that the family is defined as that unit bound 
by blood, by birth, by adoption, and by marriage.  What 
do you think the most serious social consequence is if we 
change what marriage means?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, already, marriage has been 
severely weakened by many forces:  pornography, no-fault 
divorce, sex education that omits marriage as a central 
element and talks about partners.  I mean, marriage is 
already, as the author Maggie Gallagher says, on the outs 
in the society.  She calls it a post-marital culture, and 
we are reaping a whirlwind from it.  Certainly crime is 
one of the greatest aspects of that, but if we go the 
final route and say that men and women are not different 
and homosexual marriage is the equivalent of a man and a 
woman together, then we have embraced a lie.  We have 
embraced something that is so toxic that it will spoil 
the whole culture, because you cannot lie about something 
as basic as nature and get away with it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thanks so much for being with 
us today, and we are going to watch very closely what 
happens through your work on the Defense of Marriage Act.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for having me, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares my conversation with Captain Scott 
O'Grady.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I recently had the 
opportunity to speak with Captain Scott O'Grady, the Air 
Force pilot who survived 6 days and nights in hostile 
Bosnian territory before his miraculous rescue.  This 
life-changing experience occurred almost 1 year ago, and 
Captain O'Grady's life has not been the same since.

<p>

Let's hear what he has to say about life as an American hero.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Scott, thank you so much for 
joining us on <i>Straight Talk</i>. I do not think there are 
too many people who have not heard your story by now, and 
we do want to hear your story, too, but your life has 
changed a lot since you were rescued.  How is it 
different?  I mean, all your life, you are training to be 
a pilot, and suddenly you are a pilot plus more, 
something philosophical for America.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, it is something that I 
thought was just going to go away, actually, and when I 
moved out to Hill Air Force Base, Salt Lake City area, 
where I am now assigned, flying the F-16, I pretty much 
thought that a lot of the requests in the mail would come 
to an end, and they have not, and I was trying to decide, 
you know, what can I do with all of this, and I am 
working hard on trying to fulfill all the requests a lot 
of people have of me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What kind of requests do people have?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Oh, there are a lot of 
different charity organizations that would like to have 
me stop by or community organizations and schools.  That 
is what I do now is I fly the F-16 half the month, but 
the other half of the month I travel a lot, and I do 
speaking engagements; I do the schools, or just as an 
example, I will go to a fund-raiser for a charity.

<p>

I am deciding now that I need to get some 
organization.  I have some help from people that are 
helping me with all the requests, and I am going to 
narrow it down to where I am going to concentrate on two 
charities.  I am going to concentrate on still visiting 
schools and doing things for community organizations, but 
people have to realize that I am only one person, but I 
do tell them that if they would be patient, that I will 
live a long life --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And you will get there some day.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  I will get there some day.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  In a way, you have become the 
ambassador for the military to the rest of the America.  
I think the military in some ways is at a time, 
especially in the media, of a lot of criticism, and you 
have presented a symbol of what the military is proud of.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: See, I am not a spokesman for the military.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, I understand.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: And I do not even recruit for 
the military.  I do not do that.  But I will tell people 
all the time how happy I am to be serving in the military 
and how fantastic it is to have worked with all the great 
people that are in the Air Force, the Navy, the Marines, 
the Army, and the Coast Guard.  People have to realize 
that we are just like everyone else in America.  We are 
the same people.  We have the same feelings.  But yet we 
are also doing a job that does not ask the normal demands 
that a job in the civilian sector would.  We are in a job 
that could ask for you to put your life on the line to 
defend freedom, and people are dedicated enough and 
believe in their cause that if that is the call, then 
they are going to go ahead and do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have a friend right now that is 
in Korea.  Obviously there are some tensions there, North 
Korea talking about going into the demilitarized zones, 
and there are a lot of hot spots around the world.  He 
told me that the thing that was most impressive to him 
about your experience was that you went by the book.  You 
know, you were sitting there following all these 
procedures and that this was successful.

<p>

How did your training prepare you for what you experienced?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, training is something 
that we have in the military, and it prepares us not only 
just how to run things on a day-to-day operational basis, 
but also we prepare for emergencies.  We prepare for the 
unexpected.  It is all training that is based on previous 
successes and previous failures, because you always learn 
from your experiences to be able to benefit those in the 
future, and that just does not go with military training; 
it goes with day-to-day living.

<p>

But it was a foundation for me to grab hold of, 
something that was real and tangible when everything was 
going crazy all at once in just brief short periods of 
time, but it also does not give you the motivation to get 
through a time like that.  You have to derive your 
strength from somewhere else, and the inspiration I got 
was definitely from people that I know that have gone 
through worse situations, those who have been prisoners 
of war, those who have been in survival situations, maybe 
not even in combat, and I knew that they had gone through 
hard times and could get through.

<p>

So they gave me inspiration, but really it came 
down to, for me, getting the strength to get through it 
came from faith, came from love of family, came from love 
of country.  And that is really where, when you get down 
to the bottom basics of going through a situation like I 
went through, you have to have somewhere deep inside you 
the will to live, love of life, and that is where it 
comes from.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, the President 
of the United States, accompanied by General John M. 
Shalikashvili, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, the 
Honorable William J. Perry, and Captain Scott O'Grady.

<p>

GENERAL SHALIKASHVILI:  Mr. President, Secretary
Perry, members of Congress, other distinguished guests,
members of the Armed Forces.  Thank you for coming, even
in this rain, and for helping us welcome home this very 
special young man, Captain Scott O'Grady, and to extend a
warm welcome to his father, Dr. O'Grady, his mother, Mrs.
Scardapane[?], her husband, Mr. Scardapane, Scott's
brother Paul and his sister Stacy, and his grandparents.
We are delighted you could all be here today, for surely
this is a very proud and a very happy moment for us all.
Welcome.

<p>

Ten days ago, like thousands of other men and 
women in uniform, performing dangerous missions in 
difficult and demanding circumstances all over the world, 
Captain O'Grady was flying over Bosnia, doing his part to 
deny the skies to those who would rain death and 
destruction upon that war-torn land below, but as we all 
now know, in the early morning hours of 2 June, the 
course of Captain O'Grady's life took a dramatic turn, 
and the next 6 days put to test every bit of his 
knowledge, every fiber of his courage, every bit of skill 
and determination, and every ounce of faith that he could 
muster, and for 6 long days, people around the world, his 
family, his friends, every American, waited impatiently 
for news of his fate, and while they were 6 long days for 
us to wait, they must have seemed like an eternity for 
Scott O'Grady.

<p>

Then, on the 7th of June, out of the darkness in 
the hills of Bosnia came that voice; this is Badger 52.
At last we had our opportunity, and so a remarkable team
that had been praying for that call sprang into action.
NATO's combined air operation center in Vicenza, Italy -- 
Americans, Italians, Dutch, French, Spanish -- under the 
direction of U.S. Air Force Major General Hal 
Hornberg[?], quickly took control and started issuing 
orders.

<p>

At Avigliano[?], Colonel Chuck Wald[?] began to 
launch air defense suppression aircraft and those that 
would provide close air support, if needed.  Others made 
sure that air refueling aircraft were in station, to 
include a French KC-135.  Still others double-checked 
that NATO AWACs and the French E-3M with Major 
L'Enfant[?] on board, were ready to provide airborne 
control and radar data, and off the deck of the USS 
Kiresarge[?], under the command of Colonel Marty Burn[?], 
into the dark foggy night rose those who would this day 
do the heavy lifting, the Stallion helos, the Cobra 
gunships, the Harriers, and the Marines of the 24th 
Expeditionary Unit, and 2 hours and 5 minutes later, 
Colonel Marty Burn reached out his hand and pulled Scott 
aboard the rescue helicopter.

<p>

Although they still had to dodge bullets and 
shoulder-fired rockets, Scott was at last on his way 
home, and the professionalism, the courage, the inner 
strength of Captain O'Grady and every member of the team 
that brought him home are vivid reminders, if reminders 
we need, that our greatest strength and the source of our 
deepest pride are our men and women in uniform, and the 
deeds of courage that we are here to salute and applaud 
are reminders, as well, of our responsibility to take 
care of them and of their families.

<p>

Scott, today is an especially great day to wear 
America's uniform, and you and the rest of your team have 
made it so.  For that I thank you and I salute you, and 
with a great deal of happiness, I welcome you home.
Welcome home, Scott.  Welcome home.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more from 
Captain Scott O'Grady after this commercial break.  Don't
go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are sharing our 
conversation with Captain Scott O'Grady as he discusses 
memories of the fateful events which changed his life 
forever.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  The first thing I want to do is thank God, thank 
God for His love.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you remember most about 
your experience?  We have heard a lot.  You were 
obviously shot down, you were behind enemy lines, and 
they were looking to kill you, and eventually you were 
rescued.  What do you remember most about that 
experience?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, if I would have come 
home and nobody would have paid attention to the story 
and I just would have returned to my family, it still 
would have been the most positive experience of my life.
The thing that people have to realize is that I do not
recommend, you know, life-threatening situations as being
something that everybody should explore, but it was 
definitely something that I was able to, like I said 
before, look inside myself and see what is really 
important in life, and the relationship you have with 
your faith, and it is not just so much having a faith as 
having trust, and then love of family.

<p>

I would have given up everything I own to be 
able to return to my family, and you realize that that is 
what is really important, those relationships, because 
materialistic things are things that you are not going to 
take with you, and it isnt until your health is 
threatened that -- you forget all the time in your day-to-day 
living how valuable your health and your well-being is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How has it changed you now, now 
that you have had this experience, really a crystallizing 
moment where you could have lost everything including 
your life?  So how do you live differently?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Oh, I still have the problems 
as everybody else, but you just keep on constantly 
remembering what is important in life and where your 
priorities should lie, and with that, though, try to 
simplify your life to where then you can have the room 
and the space and the time to be able to concentrate on 
those relationships that are the most important thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What kind of advice would you give 
somebody from that?  I mean, what kind of tool to help 
them understand?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  I think the biggest thing is 
people have to realize that myself and other individuals 
who have gone through a situation like this, we did not 
ask for it, and we also of course prior to this would 
say, oh, gee, I could never get through something like 
that, because even now I have people who come up to me 
and say I never could have done what you did, and that is 
not true.

<p>

You would be surprised what kind of strength you 
have inside you when you are faced with an adverse 
situation, and you have to just concentrate hopefully on 
what is really important in life.  I know that everybody 
gets wrapped up in the day-to-day living, and there is 
always this to worry about and that to worry about, but 
if you take a step back and kind of look at the big 
picture, you realize that most of the things you are 
dealing with and most of your worries in life really are 
not that important.

<p>

MR. PERRY:  We are here today to celebrate true 
grit, great training, superior technology, and 
outstanding leadership.  The true grit is obvious to the 
entire country.  It was the courage and skill 
demonstrated by Captain O'Grady.  They shot down his 
plane but not his spirit.  The true grit was also evident 
in the courage and skill of Colonel Burn and the Marine 
Corps search and rescue team.  They proved that the 
Marines have landed and the situation is well in hand.

<p>

The great training was evident in the efficiency 
of the operation, reflected in Captain O'Grady's training 
and survival techniques, and the Marines' training in 
search and rescue operations.  Training is the key to 
ready effective forces, because the more you sweat in 
peace, the less you bleed in war.

<p>

Normally, the technology of greatest importance 
in search and rescue operations is our night vision 
devices.  These allow us to operate at night and give us 
the benefit of stealth.  As the Army says, we own the 
night.

<p>

However, this search and rescue operation had to 
be conducted in daylight.  So we lost the advantage of 
operating at night.  But fortunately, we had the 
advantage of another piece of technology, the Global 
Positioning Satellite, or GPS.  Captain O'Grady used the 
GPS receiver in his survival kit to determine his exact 
location to within 100 feet, and the search and rescue 
team, using its own GPS receiver, was able to set down 
virtually at the pilot's position. This allowed them to 
keep their time on the ground, the time of greatest risk, 
to only 2 minutes.  This was an amazing performance for a 
search and rescue operation.

<p>

I want also to note the outstanding leadership 
of General Jawin[?], Admiral Smith, Lieutenant General 
Ryan, and, yes, General Shalikashvili.  They were faced 
with a really tough decision.  They had planned a night 
operation to take advantage of our night vision 
technology, but Captain O'Grady's radio signal was 
confirmed just 3 hours before dawn.

<p>

So they had to make a choice, either to wait 
another 18 hours until the next nightfall to rescue him, 
and that would risk that the pilot would be captured 
during the day, or to go immediately, even without the 
advantage of operating at night.  They chose to go.  It 
was a gutsy decision.

<p>

It turned out to be the right decision, and it 
was in the best military tradition, exemplified in a 
famous letter that was pointed out to me by General 
Sullivan, Chief of Staff of the Army, the letter that 
General Sherman wrote to General Grant.  He said:  I knew 
wherever I was that you thought of me, and if I got in a 
tight place, you would come.  To Captain O'Grady, Colonel 
Burn and the Marine search and rescue team, General 
Jawin, Admiral Smith, and General Ryan, you should be 
very proud of your performance.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we 
will hear more about Captain Scott O'Grady's heroic 
experience and miraculous rescue.  Join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. We are sharing 
with you my visit with an American hero, Captain Scott 
O'Grady, as we hear some of his memories and trials and 
triumph.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Could you describe for us your 
darkest moment and your brightest moment during that 
experience?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: The darkest moment was 
actually when I was on the ground for the first couple of 
hours and the people were walking very close to my 
proximity, and I heard approximately five or six 
gunshots, and they were all carrying rifles, and the way 
it was sporadically done, along with the different 
locations, the only thing I could conclude was that they 
saw something or heard something that they heard was me 
and shot at it, and that scared me, because now I am 
thinking that the probability of getting caught is going 
to be very high, but I also was anticipating the fact 
that I would be mistreated, but now, because of that 
occurrence, I thought instead of being mistreated, they 
would probably just kill me.  So that was actually the 
time of a very heightened state of fear.

<p>

Prior to that, a lot of things happened to me, 
but I just did not have time to be afraid.  Afterwards, I 
really was not afraid when I was out there.

<p>

As far as the greatest moment, it was definitely 
when I finally could hear Tio Hanford[?] come up on the 
radio and respond to my voice.  That was like being 
reborn.  It was like a bolt of energy that ran through me 
that I had never had before, because you wanted to let 
loose on every emotion possible; you wanted to laugh, you 
wanted to scream, you wanted to cry, and that was a 
fantastic and phenomenal moment in my life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Then when you returned to base and 
you got to see men and women who you knew well and who 
had really prayed for your return, what was that like?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  That was unexpected and a very 
emotional time, too.  In fact, when I got off the 
airplane and I saw everybody in the hangar, I had to go 
and get cleaned up, because, again, I was very emotional.  
So we went off, and I took a little bit of a breather, 
and then we came back and said hello to everybody, and 
that was a fantastic time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you have any momentos from that 
experience, either a mental momento or even a physical 
momento?  Do you have anything that you can hold in your 
hand and you remember?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, I always have my cross 
on, and that was with me, and I had my Swiss army knife 
that got me through, and then my watch.  But as far as 
momentos, the biggest thing is just the memory of the 
event, and it has actually become a story to me, because 
I have been able to tell a lot of people about it, and 
there are no nightmares.  It is actually the most 
positive thing that has ever happened to me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It changed your life.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  It definitely did.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, I know you are going to work with St. Jude's.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, I am going to try to 
start a relationship with two charities.  We have not 
done anything yet.  I am trying to organize all these 
things that are coming up in my life that I never 
expected, and one of the two charities I really want to 
set up a relationship with is St. Jude's Children's 
Hospital, also the Make A Wish Foundation.  Both 
concentrate on children which are going through adverse 
times, trying to overcome diseases that are life-threatening, 
and if that does not tug at your heart, I do not know what will.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we close, Scott, your 
experience really can relate to what these kids are 
facing.  They are going to be asked to deal with pain and 
suffering that they are pretty unprepared for.  What do 
you think you can tell them when they are looking to 
something that seems very dark to them?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, the biggest thing I 
learned is you never quit, and you never even think about 
anything but a good outcome.  You always keep a positive 
mental attitude.  But for me, the reason why those two 
hit home so well is the fact that these are children that 
do not have the normal lifestyle that I had when I was 
growing up.  They do not have a normal childhood.  Here 
they are inflicted with something that they did not ask 
for, just like I did not ask for what happened to me, and 
yet have also such great life and spirit inside of them.  
It is really a treat to be able to go and be able to do 
something for those children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And their tragedies can be a great triumph for 
them, as well.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: Oh, yes. Yes, it is definitely character-building.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Scott, thank you so much for being with us on 
<i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Thanks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares how policy makers and communities can make a 
difference in stopping the breakdown of marriages in 
America.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you a portion 
of a recent panel discussion at the Heritage Foundation, 
which tackled the collapse of marriage and its economic 
and social consequences.  Bill Mattox, the Vice President 
for Family Research Council's Policy Division, provided 
his expertise regarding this important issue.  So let's
hear some of Bill's insight on tonight's Homefront News.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>

MR. MATTOX:  There are many implications for 
policy makers and others for the collapse of marriage, 
and I want to take just a minute to outline a couple.  
For public policy makers, I think it is going to be 
extremely important for public policy makers to be 
cautious about making divorce law distinctions between 
couples with children and couples without.

<p>

Bill Galston[?] did all of us a tremendous favor 
several years back when he and Elaine Kaymark[?] 
presented a paper from the Progressive Policy Institute 
called "Putting Children First," which argued that on 
many of these kinds of questions, the first question we 
should be asking ourselves is how will children fare, how 
do children fare, and what ought we do to meet the needs 
of children?

<p>

I think that is a very important question for us 
to consider when it comes to marriage, for all of the 
reasons that have been cited about the negative effects 
of divorce and out of wedlock childbearing on children, 
but I guess when it comes to public policy, I am a bit 
disturbed about the possibility of making distinctions on 
this basis, considering those marriages in which a child 
is present somehow different from those in which a child 
is not, and the reason is just because I think, though it 
is clear that a child's well-being is more adversely 
affected by the break-up of his own parents' marriage, I 
think it is nevertheless true that a child is going to be 
affected by the failure of other marriages in the 
community, most especially marriages of their neighbors, 
their extended family members, their grandparents, and 
other role models in the community.

<p>

I also think, by the way, that we need to look 
at the whole question of affirmative action, of all 
things, and how it may be contributing inadvertently to 
problems of marriage breakdown in the black community, 
and there is a dramatic difference in the way in which 
minority women and minority men are being assimilated 
into the current labor force.

<p>

What you see is that minority women are much 
more likely to move into positions of promotions and get 
higher salaries than are minority men, and I think part 
of the reason for this may in fact be that with the 
current affirmative action policies dealing with both the 
subject of race and gender, that what has happened is 
that a minority woman is in a sense a two-bagger for an 
employer.  If he hires or she hires a minority woman, 
that both improves the race makeup and improves the 
gender makeup, whereas a minority male is kind of a mixed 
bag.  He improves the race mix, but it comes at the 
expense of the gender mix, and I think for that reason 
there is a subtle inclination or pressure or tendency for 
some employers to favor minority women over minority men.

<p>

Lastly, let me say that as much as we might want 
to try to tackle this through public policy, I am not 
convinced that the problem can be turned around 
significantly by public policy means.  In fact, I am 
increasingly convinced that it is going to be churches 
and other community-based institutions that will help to 
turn this around.

<p>

We need to be encouraging leaders in religious 
institutions to deal with what I believe to be a rather 
casual attitude about divorce and remarriage in both 
their doctrinal teaching, as well as in their premarital 
counseling practices, whether or not they conduct those.  
I am extremely encouraged by this idea of having 
community marriage policies where all the ministers in a 
community agree that they will not marry someone until 
they have gone through premarital counseling.

<p>

I also think there needs to be greater emphasis, 
of course, at the practical level with marriage 
enrichment programs, and I think that there needs to be 
an emphasis on relationship building across generations.  
This is something that I think can be facilitated to a 
great extent by the church.

<p>

The couples that succeed are those who learn to 
resolve conflict.  It is not that they do not experience 
the same ups and downs and have the same sort of problems 
as everybody else.  It is that they manage to somehow 
work through their difficulties, to persevere, and to 
quite often come out on the other side of those problems 
with a stronger marriage, and I think in many ways some 
of the older couples in our communities and in our 
country have the opportunity to share with younger folks 
that sense of, hey, you can make it, stick it out, work 
through these things, and can perhaps strike that balance 
that is so needed where we hang onto our romantic ideals 
about what we want marriage to be while at the same time 
confronting the sober realities of how difficult it quite 
often is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight
on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are looking at the drug crisis which
has crippled our nation, destroying communities and shattering
families.  Illicit drug use strangles the life out of many people,
and America desperately seeks solutions.  One of the newest answers
comes in the form of needle exchange programs in which drug users
who shoot up exchange used, often AIDS-tainted needles for sterile
needles.  Needle exchange programs claim to curb the spread of
the AIDS virus without encouraging drug abuse, but is that true?
Tonight, we will investigate.  You will want to hear what some
experts have to say about our continuing battle against drugs
and for lives.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Family Research Council's president,
Gary Bauer.  The political implications of character are news
this week, as analysts discuss what the Whitewater convictions
of Bill Clinton's friends will mean for his presidency.  With
years of political experience, Gary Bauer brings a special insight
into the power of the values and character issues.

<p>

Polls indicate that most Americans believe that our country
is on a downward spiral and that politicians are poor role models,
especially on moral issues.  Let's hear Gary's predictions on
where America's values are headed as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are here today on Behind the Headlines.
Thank you, Gary Bauer, very much for being with us.

<p>

Gary, we are talking about whether there is a future for
character and values issues today with the current political climate,
and you have been a champion of values issues for the last 20
years, but some people think that character and values issues
today are waning.

<p>

Do you agree?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I don't know.  There is good news and bad news.
I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming that the overwhelming
majority of the American people are worried about values related
issues.  I mean, that shows up in just about every poll you have.
You have two thirds of the country saying that we are headed
in the wrong direction, and when you press them on it, it usually
ends up being value related or issues related to virtue.

<p>

The bad news, however, is that there seems to be a disconnect
between that public concern and the political process.  The most
disturbing poll I have seen of all has just come out in the last
couple days by, I believe, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and it showed
that only 22 percent of the American people think that electing
someone of high moral character to the presidency is important.
Now I wonder whether that is an accurate poll or not.  If it
is accurate, that is a pretty disturbing sign in a country that
in the past grew up talking about George Washington cutting down
the cherry tree and Lincoln walking miles to return a library
book, and so forth, and it may be a sign of the fact that we have
really drifted a great deal in recent years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, it would appear that some of the cynicism
could be created by the media.  If you look back at Watergate
and at that as being a time in our nation where we said all our
politicians are crooks and liars, and now people are really taking
a lot of the attitudes that politicians are lying anyway.  Do
you see that as you go across the country, that people are assuming:
well, they are all liars, so I want to get the best liar I can
get.

<p>

MR. BAUER: That may be exactly what is at the heart of that
polling result.  I do go around the country a lot, and there is
incredible cynicism among the public.  Many times people are just
throwing up their hands and saying I give up; I have tried election
after election to find somebody that will represent my values;
I am always disappointed; it doesn't make any difference; I'm
just going to do the best I can in my home town in my neighborhood
and forget all these guys that are making all the promises to
me.

<p>

I think there is a sense in the public, too, that all politicians
do have a problem with the truth, and so why hold them up to an
unnaturally high standard by insinuating that you are only going
to elect people of high moral character?  I tend to become cynical
about these things, too, but I actually believe that there is
a difference in many races in the candidates.  I think you can
find people in both parties that have high moral character, and
I would urge my fellow Americans to not give up looking, because
it is too important to do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In past elections, personal character was a
powerful issue, and in fact, if you look at the Eisenhower race,
Eisenhower basically ran as I am the one who is the good guy,
who helped you all in World War II, so vote for me because of
who I am, not for what I stand for.  Character has really been
powerful, and yet today it seems that policy is all that counts.
We do not even look at character at all.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, yes, Eisenhower was the ultimate character
campaign, and I think Americans very distinctly and very intentionally
voted for somebody that they thought would bring a certain set
of character values into the Oval Office.  Today, I don't know,
there seems to be this disconnect.  In my view, for example --
I am not speaking about any particular politician; I'm just making
a general point -- if there is evidence that a politician can't
keep his promises to his own spouse, then the question that comes
to my mind is why in the world would I trust that politician to
keep their promises to me, somebody that the politician doesn't
even know?  He's made no legal or faith-based commitments to me
as a voter.  I think all those things about how a man or a woman
running for office, all the things in their personal life, do
end up sending us signals about what we can expect from them in
office.  There is a fine line about how much of this you actually
bring up in a campaign.  I don't think most Americans want their
personal lives debated, but on the other hand, I think we do want
to know the character of the individual that we are electing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You mentioned earlier, Gary, two stories that
really have marked the nation's psyche, stories about George Washington
saying I cannot tell a lie, or Abraham Lincoln and his tremendous
honesty and a character that we have all nationally admired, and
it seems that a lot of these stories have marked who we are as
a people, but are they still being taught to our children?  Are
they still having an impact on our national psyche?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, this may be one of the things right at
the heart of the problem.  When I was Undersecretary of Education
under Bill Bennett, one of the things we did was go back and look
at the textbooks in use in America's schools around the country,
and much to our shock, we found that those stories that you and
I grew up with and I would suspect most of our viewers grew up
with, are not in the textbooks anymore.  You can't find elementary
school textbooks that tell the George Washington story.  These
stories are now in some ways mocked and are considered to be a
part of legend, and the character-forming role that they played
with young people has been abandoned.  In fact, we went back and
looked for a couple of dozen things, things like the great sayings
from America's past -- I regret I have but one life to give for
my country, things like that.  Those all have been taken out of
American textbooks, and I think much to our detriment.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The character issue has played a very large
role with President Clinton in the various campaigns that have
been run against him, and it was interesting over Memorial Day
Weekend that some Medal of Honor winners took out full page advertising
chastising him for trying to hide behind his symbolic title of
commander in chief to get away from a sexual harassment suit,
and as one columnist said, he takes one character flaw, dodging
the draft, and highlights it in his attempts to dodge a second
character flaw, which would be alleged sexual proclivity.  Yet,
the character issue does not seem to stick to Bill Clinton.  A
lot of people are urging Bob Dole to make it an issue.  Do you
think that it is going to work?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, this is the question that George
Bush asked himself during an entire campaign.  The character issue
was a major focus of the Bush/Clinton campaign, and as we all
know, it did not work.  Bill Clinton won.  I can understand why
the Dole campaign wants to try to use the character issue now,
and maybe they will have more success with it, but I am afraid
there is not a lot of evidence, at least as of now, that this
is going to be a cutting edge issue for people.  I think character
is important.  I think politicians ought to talk about it and
continue to bring it up, but I think the Dole campaign is going
to have to find more than that if they hope to take care of the
rather large lead that Bill Clinton has opened up as of now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At one point in our nation's history, adultery
would in and of itself be a sufficient character issue to knock
you out.

<p>

MR. BAUER: No question about it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But today what would do that?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I don't know. I mean, I am not sure there
is one single character issue that by itself would doom a candidate.
Certainly, people still get upset about financial matters, evidence
that a candidate has cheated on his income taxes or has played
fast and loose with the public's money.  Those things still seem
to strike a responsive chord.  But in matters of sexual mores
and in marriage and those kinds of issues, the country seems to
have gone pretty far down the road as being willing to ignore
those things in making judgments about who to elect to high public
office.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When it comes to candidate Dole, it is pretty
universally believed that he has phenomenal character, and obviously
he is scarred in the service for his country, and people do think
that he has character, but when it comes to the values issues,
people sometimes question whether he will really be a fighter
for them.  Do you think that his vice presidential candidate will
be a very key factor for him, because a lot of people are looking
to that appointment to send a statement about whether he will
be a fighter for values issues.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, first of all, let me just say about Senator
Dole that he is a dying breed in America, I think.  That is my
father's generation, and they were unique in their commitment
to their country, the sacrifices they were willing to make.  People
will have political disagreements with Senator Dole, but I think
they have to concede that there was a time when men like Senator
Dole were in the majority, and now as time passes, there seem
to be fewer and fewer people that would fit the description that
one comes up with when you look at Senator Dole's career.

<p>

On the other hand, you raise an interesting point. Senator
Dole has a reputation of being a grand compromiser and of cutting
the differences between the two sides.  Right now, I think what
Americans are looking for is somebody who will stick to their
guns and will be predictable on the kind of values they are willing
to speak up for, and because of that, I think the vice presidential
choice really is important.  I think Senator Dole needs to pick
somebody who has the same values and the same philosophy as he
does.  Otherwise, he is going to send the signal that he really
does not care that deeply about these issues; why else would you
pick someone as your running mate that disagreed with you on major
things.  So this is going to be an important decision for Senator
Dole, and I hope that he will defy the inside the beltway wisdom
on this and pick another solid conservative to be his running
mate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What values issues have a future in this election
in your estimation?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think where the values issues really
reach critical mass is when they touch on young people and what
it is we are teaching our children.  I think that any time that
Senator Dole can bring up America's youth, can talk about the
concern that I think Americans feel about where our children are
headed, the statistical evidence that something has gone seriously
wrong with how we are raising young people in the country -- those
are issues that I think are very important in the public mind.
I think it is why Bill Clinton tries to picture himself as often
as he can with children, why he has talked about getting tougher
on discipline in the schools.  He knows these issues strike a
bell with the American people, and this could be an issue that
would end up being very important before the election is over.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you once again for being with us
on <i>Straight Talk</i>'s Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: My pleasure, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight
Talk</i> begins our discussion about America's drug problem and
the validity of needle exchange programs as a solution.  Please
stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape following.]

<p>

MAN: I think there definitely is a drug problem in the United
States, basically because of the irresponsibility.  People want
to use them and want to use them how they want to do it, and it
basically just gets really out of control.

<p>

MAN: Drugs are just ruining our country.  I mean, the economic
structures behind drugs that I know of is astronomical.

<p>

WOMAN: See, I think there are a lot of problems with drugs
now that they are illegal.  I think a lot of people would take
it to an extreme if they were available.  I mean, people take
alcohol to an extreme right now, and I just think it would cause
more problems.  It is much more dangerous.

<p>

MAN: I just think legalizing drugs is going to maybe take
away the demand for it, but the violence is going to be there,
and it is just going to turn our society -- it is going to keep
going downhill.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: America's war on drugs has entered a new battleground,
with some using a deadly virus as their sword, and they are winning
some ground.  Needle exchange programs are cropping up in cities
across the nation.  Currently 75 needle exchange programs reside
in 55 U.S. cities, and these programs claim to save lives.  According
to a 1995 government-commissioned study, providing clean needles
to intravenous drug users slows the spread of the HIV virus. 
Yet, many experts, government officials, and addicts themselves
question these findings, and many of those questions arise from
the examples of other countries such as Switzerland, where needle
exchange programs were implemented, along with easy access to
clean intravenous drug paraphernalia through vending machines.

<p>

In Zurich, drug users were provided a safe haven in which
to obtain needles, known as needle park, which soon became a drug
orgy of sorts for addicts, providing 12,000 needles per day before
the park closed in 1992, because of the social decay it was causing
in the community.

<p>

The addicts then sought refuge in an abandoned railway station,
where 15,000 clean needles were exchanged daily.  In that environment,
attitudes toward drug use grew lax, making it easier for drugs
to become mainstream via legalization.

<p>

Yet problems with the drug culture did not go away.  Switzerland's
30,000 heroin addicts are the highest per capita rate in Europe,
and the Swiss have the second highest HIV infection rate.

<p>

It seems America has not learned from nations' experiments.
Will we pursue policies that make drug use easy, or will we build
successful rehabilitation programs?  Do drug overdoses with clean
needles justify so far failed attempts at reducing the spread
of the HIV virus?  Will federally funded needle exchange programs
pave the way for drug legalization?  These questions must be answered
before the drug war claims more lives, some of them even today.

<p>

MAN: We are losing the battle, and until the government
switches its playing ground and switches what it is really targeting,
we are going to continue to lose and eventually lose our children,
which is going to be the biggest loss.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: No one can ignore America's battle for lives,
and tonight I am joined by some real warriors:  Shepherd Smith,
the president and founder of Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy,
who researches effective AIDS treatment and compassionate care
for those infected with the virus; also here is Lieutenant Colonel
Robert Maginnis who serves as the Family Research Council's policy
expert on America's drug problems; and we are joined by Dr. Sally
Satel, who is a psychiatrist at the District of Columbia's Pretrial
Drug Treatment Program.  Welcome to all of you.

<p>

It is certainly a dark setup piece, but I think the question
that a lot of people are asking is is there a growing drug problem
in America, because you are seeing some nightly news reports to
indicate that it is not really the issue that we all thought.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, since 1979 we have cut the number
of people in this country that are routinely abusing drugs in
half, but now since 1990 and 1991, the number of especially marijuana
users is up, and we are not really sure if that is going to lead
to an increase in heroin.  The heroin numbers are up, too, but
we are still waiting to find out if that is going to be a long-term
effect.  So we really need to come back and reexamine the things
we did well in the early 1980s to begin to turn this around. 
Clearly there is a problem, and it is an ongoing problem.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Shepherd, you have been working with this for
a while.  You know, in terms of evaluating what was successful,
what do you think was successful?

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, one reason numbers are down, HIV has claimed
a lot of lives of IV drug users.  The area of concern is young
people is where we are seeing the greatest growth today in new
drug use.  Programs that are successful are ones that show individuals
who are addicted to drugs that someone cares about them, that
there is an opportunity for them in the future if they make corrections
in their life today.  Programs that simply support the behavior
and affirm that behavior really have not shown to be effective
that we have seen.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You are working with pretrial drug treatment,
Dr. Satel.  What are you finding about drug use?  Is it going
down, and if not, why not?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, we have a waiting list that is as long
as you can imagine.  I happen to work with patients who are in
the inner city, so I believe in that group there probably has
not been much of a decline ever in the last decade or so.  The
people I work with are those who come from backgrounds where parents
were addicted.  Often they do not know their father, and their
mother was involved with drugs.  When you have patients who will
tell you, no, I don't do cocaine -- a lot of those people do marijuana,
PCP, and some heroin, but when their reason for not doing cocaine
is because they saw what it did to their mother, you know you
are dealing with a very, very compromised group of people here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that it is the loss of life that
has resulted in slightly lower numbers, or do you think that it
is the loss of maybe yuppie users, because you are saying the
inner city is staying the same.

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, I am saying in my population, yes, it has
stayed the same.  So I do not see any particular influence in
terms of drug use as a whole.  I do think that the crack epidemic
may actually be waning a bit in the inner city; again, you could
say there is almost a self-limiting effect, when one generation
sees how the previous generation has been devastated.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, but as the crack epidemic wanes,
we are finding a growth in the methamphetamine epidemic that is
moving from the West Coast here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And for people who do not know what that is, Bob?

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: That is speed, basically.  You know,
it is manufactured here in the United States, so you don't really
have to ship it in like you do from Columbia cocaine. So there
is a very serious problem.

<p>

But going back, the mixture that we saw on the setup where
you have AIDS, an emotionally charged virus that is impacting
throughout the country, and we mix that with heroin or needle
users, you know, just a complex issue but a very frightening issue,
and we saw the situation in Switzerland, and there they were giving
out needles.  They were giving 15,000 needles a day in Latin Park[?]
there in Zurich before they shut the place down.  It was a madhouse.
I mean, there were murders.  The police would come in.  They
would turn over the cars.  There were all sorts of problems. 
Well, in this country today there is a movement to try to place
needle exchange programs in virtually every city where there is
a problem with AIDS and needle exchange.  After all, where do
most of these programs take place?  They take place in the inner
city that Sally is talking about.  They take place where you have
a high incidence of HIV.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. But why not?  Why not needle exchange?
I mean, what the needle exchange people are arguing is that if
I am exchanging dirty needles with people who already do drugs
-- I am not encouraging drug use, but what I am doing is at least
cutting down the risk of AIDS.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, that is what they are going to
tell you, but the evidence -- you know, we have gone through the
studies.  In the National Academy of Science, they acknowledge
-- a couple of physicians; there are only two, two of the three
MDs on the study -- they say, look, it is not the panacea that
it is being made out to be.  There are problems.  The best solution
for this problem is to provide treatment for people who are on
drugs.  If we get them off drugs, they are not going to come down
with HIV because they have been using dirty needles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So at the very least, needle exchange is not
an anti-drug program.  I mean, at the very least, it is not trying
to stop drug use.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Not at all, and in fact, you can give a clean
needle to an addict, and it really does not stop the transmission
of HIV if they go out and share that with another infected individual.
The message has to be don't share your works, and you do not
need to give out any equipment to give that message.  But where
the programs probably have an effect is establishing a relationship
with people who use drugs, and they feel that someone cares about
them, and they are more inclined to listen to what they say about
not having sex with somebody who is infected, not sharing needles,
and in that context they have a value, but it is really independent
of the fact that they give out clean needles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Shepherd, you have been working with AIDS and
HIV for years.  You are well-known for this issue.  Do you see
any reason to read needle exchange programs as successful in terms
of decreasing actual AIDS/HIV, and following up your comment about
death?

<p>

MR. SMITH: We really have not seen evidence that is substantive
in respect to the value of needle exchange programs and reducing
HIV infection rates.  What we are concerned about is there is
a basic logic or illogic, if you will, in the AIDS community that
says affirm people where they are, meaning don't say anything
negative about their behavior, if they are having multiple sexual
partners or if they are using drugs or they are into all sorts
of different sexual activities.  You know, affirm them where they
are.  So what needle exchange does is it does not warn the individual
that the behaviors they are participating in are very harmful
to them, and we think that honesty is a good policy, that you
ought to, you know, lay the cards on the table and say this is
your life, you can have a good future, but what you are doing
is destructive and you need to eliminate that activity if you
really want to have a fulfilling life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is not just the needles.

<p>

MR. SMITH: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to talk about this more. <i>Straight
Talk</i> brings you more after this commercial break.  Don't go
away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing two of America's
tragedies:  drug addiction and AIDS.  Here to explain whether
needle exchange programs can positively affect these problems
is Shepherd Smith, president of Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV
Policy; Lieutenant Colonel Robert Maginnis, a senior policy analyst
at the Family Research Council; and Dr. Sally Satel, a psychiatrist
who works for effective treatment with drug addicts.  Welcome
back.

<p>

We were discussing needle exchange programs before, and there
are a lot of things that people are attempting to get better behavior.
Like there is crime attached to drugs, and there is AIDS attached
to drugs, and yet some people argue that we are moving toward
legalization by some of these programs.  Do you see needle exchange
programs as being positive in terms of legalizing drugs?

<p>

MR. SMITH: They certainly contribute to the idea that drug
use is okay.  I mean, if the government is going to sponsor programs
to help addicts participate in this destructive behavior, then
it can't be all that bad.  Unfortunately for young people, we
haven't heard from this administration, we haven't heard from
any leaders, that these behaviors are harmful, and we are seeing
just dramatic increases, not just in marijuana use but smoking,
as well, tobacco.  They all interrelate.  Fortunately, in respect
to sexual activity among young people, we have seen maybe a peak.
It can't get much higher, but maybe we are going to turn the
corner soon.  But clearly the message of needle exchange is detrimental
to young people and their attitudes about drug usage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see, Doctor, in your program?
People come in and they are obviously addicts.  Are you attempting
in terms of treatment to say drug use has got to stop, or are
we talking about facilitating them and making them better drug
users, like better alcohol users or better smokers?

<p>

DR. SATEL: No, we are saying drug use has got to stop.
Now remember, the population that I am working with are people
who have committed crimes.  So they are in a drug court, and actually
they have been given a choice by the judge.  You go to jail or
you go to treatment.  Believe it or not, some of them actually
choose jail, but of those who come to treatment, no, they get
urine tested twice, three times a week.  We are very strict about
an abstinence policy, and actually we are seeking in these people
for more than just stopping drug use.  We really want to resocialize
them.  We want to make them into citizens again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In terms of some of the other gateway programs
related to AIDS and drugs, some people -- needle exchange and
also giving people drugs so that they won't commit crimes, so
here are free drugs three times a day; we are seeing that in Sweden.
Do you see any reason to believe from your population that giving
needles or giving free drugs will have any positive social effects?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Kristi, we give drugs in a sense.  We give methadone.
That is a substitute for heroin, and while I think those programs
can do a lot of good, they do reduce the commission of crime by
people who are in methadone programs, there is less AIDS transmission
of people who are in methadone programs, but about 60 percent
of people in methadone programs in New York City use cocaine,
and I actually think -- I would like to know your impression of
this, but a methadone program that I once worked at in Connecticut,
I thought that they had a fairly high threshold for dismissing
people from the program when they broke the rules, the rules being
that they used other drugs or they committed crime, and I think
the reason that the threshold was higher was because they wanted
to protect them from transmitting HIV and from contracting it.
So I think it has actually changed the profile of methadone programs,
HIV.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As in encouraging methadone use or crack cocaine
use or cocaine use?

<p>

DR. SATEL: I think it has changed the standards of acceptable
behavior in methadone programs where a patient might be dismissed,
might be said, listen, you have to leave our program if you are
going to commit crimes or use other drugs, but I think now there
may be less momentum to do that because the programs are concerned
about having people on the street now using dirty needles.  At
least before they were using the methadone and there was some
degree of safety and supervision.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like, Bob, we are substituting one
pathology for another in many ways.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, I certainly agree with that assessment.
You started off by asking about what is happening in our culture
in regard to maybe legalization.  The analogous situation that
we saw in Switzerland, this year they have an election to decide
whether or not to legalize drugs.  Now they did not start off
with that.  They started off incrementally with needle exchange
programs, with heroin programs.  They give some methadone, but
they have heroin programs, with people in jail, they give them
heroin, with people in the streets that they come in every day
and up to nine times a day they get their free heroin shots. 
And those types of programs have really facilitated a change of
attitude in the culture about drugs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In what way, Bob?  Explain that.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, they look at the problem, they
say it is out of our control, we might as well facilitate this.
You know, now they want to put drug addicts, heroin addicts,
repairing cars.  One company bragged a couple months ago that
this is the way we ought to go.  There were 94 executives of the
largest Swiss companies that came out in a public statement and
said, look, we give up on this.  We want drugs legalized.  We
think the government ought to be involved in facilitating this.
We want to reintegrate drug addicts back into the culture.  Then
companies stood up and said this is what we need to do.  So our
concern with needle exchange programs, which have yet to demonstrate
that they truly reduce HIV contraction and at the same time do
not increase drug abuse, is that if we open up the floodgates
that we will never be able to put the genie back in the bottle.
It is a scary situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that I have noticed is that often
the people talking about legalizing drugs ironically and even
sadly have drug problems in their own families.  I mean, Surgeon
General Joycelyn Elders is a good and sad example of that, her
own son being convicted of drug use.  Are you seeing that that
is one of the realities of the legalization discussion, that it
is people saying, look, so much is out of control, forget it.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, when you find one pathology, you
are liable to find another.  You know, where there are drug problems,
there are also crime problems, there are also out-of-wedlock birth
problems.  You know, all sorts of problems kind of rotate around
the same types of issues.  I don't know.  It is one of the most
gripping problems we are faced with.  I was with Senator Thompson
just a week ago, and we were trying to figure out -- you know,
the senator from Tennessee -- we were trying to figure out what
to do about the juvenile problem in this country, and we are about
to explode with violence that we have never seen before.  It is
tied into the drug issue.  It is tied into a lot of the things
that are going on in the culture.  Frankly, we are not sure, but
what we do know, based so far on these studies, is that this is
not the panacea that it has been made out to be.  We do not need
to expand the horizons of needle exchange programs and follow
a course where the Swiss have already tread.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about one minute left.  Dr. Satel,
could you address that really quickly?  Are we seeing that tracking
with family histories, that drug use is a family problem that
goes generation to generation?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Again, the patients that I am seeing, very much
so.  In fact, sadly in many cases the whole family is involved
with drugs at some time, but I should also add that sometimes
having a history of substance abuse in one's family accounts for
some very passionate advocacy, as well.  So I think it cuts both
ways, often to our advantage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is really powerful, especially in some
of the new public service announcements out.  There are some very
vocal advocates.

<p>

We are going to talk more about this when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns.  We will hear more about America's drug problem and the
possible solutions.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking to experts in
the fields of drugs and HIV/AIDS policies.  Here tonight are Shepherd
Smith, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Maginnis, and Dr. Sally Satel.
Welcome back.

<p>

Shepherd, you were talking earlier that these experts that
have been giving us sometimes bad drug policy advice or AIDS advice,
they have a lot of factors working in their own lives.  Maybe
you could explain that a little.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, the curious thing that I have found going
to international AIDS conferences and national HIV conferences
and so on is that the experts really do not want to address fundamental
problems, because they participate in a lot of the behaviors that
put people at risk in the first place.  For example, the biggest
predictor of a sexually-transmitted disease -- and HIV is an STD
-- is numbers of partners.  Yet, you cannot say at an AIDS meeting
that promiscuity is a bad thing, that having lots of partners
is a harmful behavior.  You would be ridiculed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why?  I mean, that seems obvious.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Because all of the experts have participated
in that behavior.  The same thing with the use of drugs.  Many
of these people are the product of the drug and sex revolutions
of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.  They experimented with drugs.
They did not become addicted themselves.  So they really don't
see any negative side to the use of drugs, particularly recreational
use.

<p>

Consequently, we often go back to affirming people where
they are.  It is okay to participate in that behavior as long
as you do it safely.  So that is why clean needles, condoms, and
dental dams are the answers that these folks have to this epidemic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than giving our youth a clear message
about sex, about drugs, and maybe even about alcohol.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Sure, absolutely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let me ask you then, following up on that,
Dr. Satel, we are saying that some people have used drugs and
haven't had a bad experience, and so they are not appreciating
that others can't deal with it.  I mean, are you finding that,
that drugs and alcohol are more parallel than we thought?

<p>

DR. SATEL: I think there is an enormous arrogance, actually,
among people who have managed to use these drugs and luckily for
them, in a sense, haven't succumbed.  They are highly dangerous,
as you know, and I see firsthand people who have just abdicated
their life to this.  I mean, when you have a mother who abandons
their child in a car because of crack cocaine, I mean, a maternal
instinct is a pretty hard thing to break, but somehow a drug can
saw its way through that.  I mean, this is not recreational use,
and it is certainly not a romanticized addiction to heroin.  This
is devastating.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And yet people aren't willing to treat it in
a devastating way.

<p>

Why do you think, Bob?  I mean, why have we got this disconnect
between playful drugs and the fact that people will sell their
own children, as we saw recently in the news, a woman who sold
her children to a drug dealer to pay off a debt?

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, there are tragic situations all
over.  The general perception is that the risk associated with
marijuana or alcohol or any of the other drugs is not that bad,
and if you track the national surveys of mostly teenagers, you
find that the risk assessment just keeps going down.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Their attitudes toward the risk.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, their attitude about the risk associated
with consuming these things.  Why?  Because our leaders in our
country have not been beating the drums that this is bad for you,
and the parents have in many cases come out of the 1960s where
they have been abusers themselves, and they have a guilty conscience
about it, and they just are not going to stand up there and tell
that young man or young woman that this is going to kill you,
it is going to ruin your life, and this is my experience.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Clinton Administration has come under criticism
for weakening the message on drugs, for firing a lot of people
in the Office of Drug Policy, and Just Say No might have been
simple -- it wasn't the only part of the program, but it certainly
was a clear signal.

<p>

Shepherd, do you see some of these changes?

<p>

MR. SMITH: Absolutely. The Clinton Administration deserves
all the criticism on this issue it can get.  It devastated the
National AIDS Policy Office.  It has not spoken out to say that
these behaviors are harmful.  You know, it is so politically correct.
One of the words you cannot use in PC is normal, because that
implies that there is abnormal behavior, and so we can't say anything
negative then about behaviors that are harmful, and with our hands
tied under political correctness, we have not been able to talk
about values in respect to how children, young people, should
live.  We haven't been able to articulate relationships, what
I am obligated to you in a community to do and what obligations
you have to me, to help each other, to pick each other up, to
point out failures and to then correct our ways.  We can't do
any of those things.  So we are letting young people make decisions
that adults have difficulty making.  I mean, it is a horrible
situation, and this administration bears a great deal of the 
responsibility of where we are today.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This administration, Dr. Satel, has focused
a lot on things like considering needle exchange and considering
any garden variety of segue program, rather than strictly dealing
with how do we get out.  You are an expert in that.  What programs
work in terms of getting people out?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, speaking of the administration for a second,
I would like to note that they also cut the budget for treatment
programs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So they cut the policy arm and the treatment
arm both.

<p>

DR. SATEL: Yes, they did.  Meanwhile, we may be regulating
tobacco, which gives a very bizarre message.  That is a potent
irony.  But there are programs that do work, programs that frankly
I think could work better.  For example, actually, the program
that I am involved in, which is tied in with the court system,
I think is very powerful, because it has real sanctions and a
real accountability for the individuals that are going through
it.  As I mentioned, we get urine tests, and then there are other
kinds of consequences if patients do not comply.  But there are
other kinds of treatment, and they depend on the severity of use.
I do wish we had more residential treatment programs.  There
are only about 15,000 beds in the country, and according to ONDCP,
we have something like 2 million hard-core addicts.  Now admittedly
I don't think every one of them needs a bed in a residential treatment
program, but I would say a good proportion of them do, and those
programs are long-term.  They are 18 to 24 months.  Phoenix House
is an excellent model.  It really rebuilds people.  It does not
see addiction so much as a disease but as a symptom of a disordered
life that needs --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Let's just have you comment on that quickly,
the idea that addictions are diseases versus maybe disorder or
lack of self-control or whatever.  Has that affected this problem?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, I think there is a lot of rhetoric about
addiction being a brain disease in fact, and while I concur wholeheartedly
that of course a drug is a toxic substance and it works on the
substrate of one's brain, so of course there are neurobiological
components to addiction, especially of course tolerance, where
you need more drug to get the same effect, and withdrawal.  Those
are clearly mediated through the central nervous system, but why
people start to use drugs in the first place and why they relapse
after months, sometimes years in fact, of being clean, that is
not something that is neurobiologically motivated.  That is a
much more complicated psychological process, and I think we underestimate
that by calling this a brain disease.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You get the last word, Shepherd.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, personal responsibility has to come back
into the vocabulary, and good programs need a spiritual element
to them to really show people that there is hope, that there is
a greater being that can help them through this, and that they
do have a future.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank you all for being with
us.  As always, Bob has been a kingpin in bringing a great team
together.

ANNOUNCER: If you are weeding through the record store this
weekend, you might want to check out Hempilation[?].  It is a
new tribute album of sorts to the joys of pot smoking.  Some talented
musicians participated in the project.  Ron Tagg[?] reports their
work has ignited quite a controversy.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: At a New York party, Capricorn Records launches
the controversial new album, Hempilation, a CD that celebrates
the use of marijuana.  Groups such as the Black Crows, Blues Traveler,
and Cypress Hill sing the praises of pot on this new compilation
album.  Royalties from the sale of the CD will benefit NORMAL,
the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.  The
group wants to decriminalize marijuana for medical, recreational,
and industrial purposes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we will take you to the Stand for
Children rally, which took place just last week.

<p>

The rally's name exemplifies what we all hold 
dear, America's children, but although those sponsoring the 
event claimed to encompass all viewpoints, all groups, and 
all individuals, we found out differently.  So we are going 
to show you another event involving pro-family and pro-
children groups who were deliberately excluded from the 
Stand for Children events, because the important issue is 
not just that we stand for children but what we stand for 
and who is standing, government or parents.

<p>

But first, let's hear from the Family Research 
Council's Director of Cultural Studies, Robert Knight.  Bob 
discusses another controversy which the media for the most 
part has ignored, the Whitewater land and loan scandal 
involving President and Mrs. Clinton.  Yet recent events and 
convictions can no longer keep the scandal out of the news. 
Let's hear Bob's unique insight as a former newsie on what 
happens to scandal Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  As a journalist with 
such prestigious publications such as the <i>L.A. Times</i>, you 
have seen a lot of things happen when it comes to
politicians and scandal.

<p>

I think in terms of Whitewater, which is the 
current business scandal affecting a Presidency to date, we 
haven't seen anything quite like it since Nixon and his Vice 
President, Spiro Agnew.  And yet we are talking about 
misdealings allegedly related to money, and the coverage on 
Whitewater has been a bit slim.  How has the coverage on 
Whitewater reflected the potential for scandal that is 
there?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, for years following revelations 
of various things Clinton had been accused of during the 
primaries when he was running for President, the press gave 
a cursory examination of the charges and then pretended that 
they had covered it, and so that was old news and they 
didn't have to look at it anymore.  And meanwhile, 
Whitewater was unfolding; witnesses were coming forward.

<p>

Certainly Troopergate, which is kind of connected 
to Whitewater, with the state troopers giving affidavits 
about all sorts of odd behavior on the part of the governor, 
was ignored.  You could find out about these things only by 
reading the <i>London Sunday Telegraph</i>; the <i>American 
Spectator</i>, the conservative magazine; and the <i>Washington 
Times</i>.

<p>

Everybody else was ignoring it, and the <i>Washington
Post</i> even ordered one reporter off the story.  He had
composed a story relating the troopers' accounts, and his
story was spiked, and he came forward and said that.  It was
a rare breach in journalistic etiquette, and he had to leave
the <i>Post</i> eventually.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There have been a lot of alleged 
misdealings by Republicans when they are in office.  We see 
Ronald Reagan and Iran Contra, where he is completely 
cleared, and in the news conference in which he is cleared, 
the prosecutor says, "I found no evidence, but I believe it, 
anyway."  You see people like Ed Meese, who was cleared.  
You see a lot of figures that were under scandal, and yet 
investigators found nothing.

<p>

And then you look at what we are seeing today in 
Whitewater.  How do you compare the treatment that Democrats 
and Republicans have received when it comes to scandal?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Like night and day.  If it's a 
Republican scandal, it's front page; if it's a Democratic 
scandal, it may not even make the pages.  You're talking 
about a failed S&L that has cost the taxpayers $50 million. 
You're talking about convictions of the governor of 
Arkansas and, at the time, Governor Clinton's two closest 
business associates.  You are talking about Hillary Clinton 
as the attorney of record for the Madison Guaranty Trust 
through Rose Law Firm.  You are talking about destruction of 
records, billing records, the mysterious reappearance of 
other billing records.  These people, if they had been 
Republicans, frankly, would have been run out of office by 
now.  I have no doubt.  There is so much that is wrong here. 
And yet the media either bury the stories, wave them away 
as meaningless and not interesting to the public because 
they are so complex, and basically have played down 
Whitewater.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  This is the way the media has really 
contrasted the Whitewater debate.  On the one hand, they 
will say Democrats are claiming it's a Republican witch hunt 
into an insignificant business dealing.  On the Republican 
side, Republicans have said it is important to look into 
Whitewater because it involves allegedly using almost 
worthless land as collateral to get loan money from 
struggling savings and loans, that loan money going either 
to Clinton's campaign or Clinton's friends -- at his 
request, allegedly -- and then all these loans are defaulted 
on and repaid by the taxpayers.

<p>

Now, that is just -- you know, it is interesting 
that these two sides are contrasted as being equally 
interesting when the media pitches it.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  That is right, and the tip of the 
iceberg in Whitewater is bigger during the iceberg during 
the Reagan years, just the tip, because they are ignoring 
things like the President's connection with Dan Lassiter, a 
convicted cocaine smuggler and a guy who peddled influence 
within the Clinton Administration and worked the state 
government, the Arkansas development authorities.  That kind 
of stuff cries out for examination.  But the press is 
(yawning), "It's just not interesting enough for us."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think it is interesting to 
contrast what is happening today with Whitewater with what 
happened in 1994 in the Texas race for governor, where the 
son of the former President, George W. Bush, is accused in 
this campaign of being involved with a savings and loan, 
merely on the board, not allegations of wrongdoing but just 
that he had been there.

<p>

You contrast that today with what is happening in
Whitewater and actual allegations of taxpayers being bilked.
Why do you think that contrast is there?  How do you explain
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: I can only conclude from years in
journalism that it is because Bush is a Republican and
Whitewater involves Democrats.  It's that simple.

<p>

I watched it at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> when I was a 
news editor.  I was amazed at how the two parties would be 
handled in routine news stories.  Here's how it works:  You 
might have a balance in a story, because they might mention 
and quote Democrats and Republicans in terms of equal amount 
of ink.  The Democrats would make heartfelt pleas that would 
pull your heartstrings about some welfare program or 
something, and the Republicans would be quoted as to 
strategy, not about why they opposed it, because they might 
have thought it hurt people, just that, "Well, we're going 
to make this an issue in the election."  It was all 
tactical; it was bloodless.  Wouldn't move anyone.

<p>

So you would think you would have the white hats 
here and the black hats over here, and they would say, 
"Well, the story is balanced.  We quoted both sides."  I saw 
this all the time, and it is because the media 
overwhelmingly are composed of liberal Democrats.  It is 
almost uniformly.  I have worked on both coasts.  I have 
worked at the <i>Miami Herald</i>, <i>Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel</i>,
the <i>Annapolis Evening Capital</i>, the <i>L.A. Times</i>. It's the 
same everywhere.  It is a liberal journalistic elite, and it
is not a conspiracy; they just hire their own.  They hire
people who think like they do, and they tend to muster out
people who don't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kenneth Starr, the independent 
prosecutor for Whitewater, had come under a lot of 
controversy and scandal himself.  He was accused of being 
the tool of a Republican witch hunt.  He was accused of 
being incompetent.  And yet he has earned three Whitewater 
convictions, two of Bill Clinton's former best friends and 
the former governor of Arkansas, who was appointed as Bill 
Clinton left for Washington.  Frankly, how is that going to 
change anything?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Oh, that should change a lot, because 
at first the press were praising Starr because they thought 
he was ineffective, frankly.  They thought, Oh, good, he's a 
nonpartisan type of guy and he is not going to delve too 
deeply.

<p>

And then as he became more serious about the case, 
they began attacking him as a political instrument of the 
Republican Party.  But his conviction in Arkansas with a 
jury of ordinary men and women in the midst of a very 
corrupt system is a stunning blow to the Clinton 
Administration, and it is a stunning blow to the people who 
say that it is merely a politically driven issue.  I mean, 
something has got to be there, and he has proved there is 
something there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now that we have three convictions 
in Whitewater, three people very close to the President, we 
are preparing for two more cases coming up in the next 
couple of weeks.  There is a lot of speculation in the media 
that someone will cut a deal.  As a journalist, do you think 
that is possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, I do; in fact, David Hale would
be the guy who could actually bring down the President. He
said that he was pressured into giving a $300,000 loan to
the Clinton campaign, and he pressured the McDougals into
doing it.  They have denied it, the President has denied it.
But if he is given immunity and testifies and he is 
believed, that could be big trouble for the President.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: After the convictions of two of Bill 
Clinton's closest former friends and then Governor Jim Guy 
Tucker, now formerly governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton came 
out and said, "Look, it's not that the jury disbelieved what 
I had to say; they thought I was okay, and they released 
seven pages of statements from the jury where the jury was 
saying things like, 'Well, yeah, I believe the President.'" 
But how do you interpret that kind of action?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, none of them wanted to accuse 
the President of the United States of being a liar.  But by 
their action, they basically said we don't believe him, even 
though some of them said, "Well, we found him quite 
believable," and then they did the opposite of what the 
President said.  So I think actions do speak louder than 
words.  That was an incredible repudiation of a sitting 
President and his sense of honor and his word.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that the Whitewater 
story has legs, that it can carry itself through the 
election cycle?  Because now, interestingly enough, a lot of 
the journalistic pundits over the weekend were saying, "Oh, 
sure, there's another court case coming up, but after that 
it's definitely a dead story."  You know, how dead is it?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  You know, it is kind of fun, because 
the Media Research Center releases statements by journalists 
when they are in unguarded moments, and they reveal the 
agenda, and a lot of them have said for weeks, months, "Oh, 
this is a dead story.  Nobody is interested in it.  Nothing 
is really going to happen."

<p>

They were stunned by the verdict.  But some of 
them are still saying, "Well, so what?"  The big so what.  
Well, so what, indeed?  The President's closest associates 
convicted, plus an Arkansas governor.  This is huge, and it 
has got to have legs now, and in fact, if the journalists 
aren't going to embarrass themselves further, they'll take 
it up full force.

<p>

I still don't expect them to do so, though, 
because I think the partisan politics of the press is so 
rigidly liberal Democrat that they still won't give it the 
coverage it deserves.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Over the weekend I watched a lot of 
the news analysis shows, and once again the reporters 
continue to assert that Whitewater is probably going to be a 
dead story even though we have three convictions and two 
trials coming up.

<p>

One of the scandals that they thought would have 
more impact was Travelgate, the firing of White House 
employees then being accused of misconduct in the course of 
their job, then being acquitted of misconduct, even though 
the FBI was brought in, and frankly, the lesser reported 
fact that these employees worked with the journalists' 
travel plans, so a lot of journalists knew them and knew 
their character.

<p>

Scandals like Travelgate, the firing of a lot of 
attorneys across the country, all kinds of issues like that 
might have potential in this election.  What scandals do you 
think will have legs?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, Travelgate is a scandal with 
legs, because it is ordinary people doing their jobs and 
then being accused of horrible things unjustly.  The FBI 
being used improperly by the White House to falsely portray 
these people as crooked, I mean, that is outrageous.  That 
is a breach of not only ethics; that is criminal behavior.

<p>

I think if that story is really played to what it 
deserves, that alone could bring down a President.  I am not 
sure it will, though.  Again, it hasn't been played very 
heavily.  Most people don't understand what occurred.  And, 
also, Hillary is at the core of that one.  It is not so much 
Bill Clinton as Hillary, because an aide of Hillary's has 
said that he felt pressure to do the firings from above.  He 
didn't name Mrs. Clinton, but it was clear where that was 
coming from.

<p>

So she is up to her neck in that.  She is up to 
her neck in the Madison Savings and Loan failure.  And never 
forget the cattle futures in which she made $100,000 in a 
week, unlike anybody else who invests like that.  I mean, 
there was clearly skullduggery going on and the insider 
trading.  That sort of has been forgotten, too, by the 
press.

<p>

I think we are getting to the point where there is 
so much there that people want to turn away and say, "It 
can't be true.  This is just so crooked, it's so extreme, 
that these people can't be guilty of all the things they've 
been accused of."  It's almost an overload, sensory 
overload, of scandal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, as you evaluate Whitewater and 
Travelgate and some of the scandals and all the media that 
has surrounded it, what do you think the big picture is for 
our <i>Straight Talk</i> viewers?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, I think there is a political 
danger that the Republicans will say, "You know what?  We 
don't have to address the core issues that our constituents 
care about:  the family tax break, the $500 tax credit, 
reestablishing the moral fabric of this country, maybe 
judicial reform, certainly all the economic reforms that are 
needed, cutting down big government, because we've got 
Whitewater."  You know, there is a complacency that may well 
set in, and I think if the Republicans fall for that, and 
the press acts characteristically to keep burying 
Whitewater, they could be very surprised in November and 
find out that the American people still weren't fully aware 
of it and just didn't care.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  We really 
appreciated your journalistic insight.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Thanks for having me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> takes you to the June 1 Stand for Children and 
to a special stand for parents by leading pro-family groups.
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segments from Children's Defense Fund's Stand for Children rally 
follow.]

<p>

CHILD: This is the day the Lord has made.  Let us 
rejoice and be glad in it.

<p>

[Song: This Little Light of Mine.]

<p>

ROSIE O'DONNELL: Fifty religious leaders, each 
with a child from his or her congregation, share the stage 
with me today.  They are here to stand for children.  It is 
time for us to make children and their rights our first 
priority.

<p>

EDWARD JAMES OLMAS:  As individuals, they, like 
all of us, have been touched by violence or by the crisis in 
health care, or by how difficult it is to obtain quality, 
affordable child care, or by the decline of our public 
school system.

<p>

IMAN: We stand for a government and a society 
that support families and their needs, not just with words 
but with actions.

<p>

MS. EDELMAN:  This is a day about unity and 
community and not about controversy.  This is a day about 
rekindling our children's hope and renewing our faith in 
each other and in our great nation's future.  It is about 
America's ideals and not about any group's ideology.  We do 
not stand here advocating big government; we stand here 
advocating just government --

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

-- government that does not give more to those who 
have and less to those who have not.  We advocate cost-
effective government that invests more to prevent than to 
punish our children's problems.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We believe that jobs and not jail should be the 
rite of passage to adulthood, and we question the family 
values of anybody that is willing to spend $20,000 to lock 
our children up but is unwilling to spend $3,500 to give 
them a head start.  We can do better.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We do not believe that government is <i>the</i> answer to
the breakdown of family, community, and moral values all 
over America, any more than we believe that hungry and 
homeless children are responsible for all of America's ills, 
as some of our leaders seem to think.  They say that we are 
too poor to invest another penny a day, each of us, to see 
that every one of our mothers has prenatal care and that we 
are too poor to invest, each of us, another nickel a day to 
give every one of our children health care, 10 million 
uninsured children; but that we are not too poor to give new 
tax breaks to the non-needy and to give the Pentagon weapons 
systems it did not even request.  We can do better than 
that.

<p>

[SONG LYRICS]:

<blockquote>

We are pieces of the puzzles.<br>
We are soldiers in the fight.<br>
Kids saving kids for our future.<br>
Come follow me into the light.<br>

</blockquote><p>

[End of Stand for Children segment.]

<p>

[Segments from Family Research Council Stand for
Children press conference follow:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What we are doing is adding and even 
clarifying some of what it means to stand for children.  In 
the Children's Defense Fund's comments about this particular 
rally, it has been a bit slanted.  There has been a great 
big government viewpoint; there has been a viewpoint that 
would say, frankly, standing for children means standing 
with government and standing with government programs.

<p>

But I am standing today with some of the leading 
pro-family organizations in the nation, groups that work 
every day on family issues and actually were not invited to 
Stand for Children.  As a matter of fact, Family Research 
Council, when we read in a newspaper account that we had 
been invited, addressed Marian Wright Edelman saying, "We 
would be glad to stand for children, we would be glad to 
address the issues that we think are important for the 
family.  However, we weren't invited.  Perhaps you would 
like to change that."  And that actually hasn't happened.

<p>

When more than 100 organizations that get a lot of 
tax money to have a welfare approach to children's issues 
say that they are going to stand for children, it is treated 
as though the name of the event equals what actually will 
happen.  The reality is that big government doesn't stand 
best for children; parents do.

<p>

In 30 years of excessive taxes, in 30 years of 
giant welfare programs and 30 years of greater and greater 
overbearing government control in our schools, what we have 
found is that parents have been squeezed out of their family 
cars, and Big Brother is driving, and frankly, he is headed 
in the wrong direction.

<p>

We need a $500-per-child tax credit.  We need 
parents to be empowered in education.  We need adoption tax 
credits, and we need them now.  We applaud the current 
Congress for their efforts on tax relief and for dealing 
with the burden of the overbearing budget that is going to 
come to our children.  

<p>

Unfortunately, liberal activists like the 
Children's Defense Fund prevailed upon President Bill 
Clinton to veto very important legislation.  The Children's 
Defense Fund has embraced an attitude that liberal elites do 
know better than parents, and, unfortunately for the 
children who get caught up in the welfare state, that just 
isn't true, and in particular, one of the shameful programs 
going on today is what is happening in foster care.

<p>

Foster care becomes a quasi-parent for more than 
600,000 abused and neglected children.  Ten percent wait 
more than seven years to get into adopted families.  We have 
made adoption very difficult, and children are caught in the 
crossfire.

<p>

Frankly, we need to make adoption easier.  When 
the family breaks down, we need to step in with limits so 
that these children could be set free for future families.  
We need to understand that what children need most is 
families, not government.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  If you look at the list of the 426 
national organizations that have endorsed this march, at 
least 102 of them received federal grants in fiscal year 
1993-1994.  These grants totaled about $400 million to these 
groups, and on top of these groups, you have lobbying arms 
of federal programs worth about $7 billion, whether it be 
the National Head Start Association, the Association of 
Women, Infants and Children's Supplemental Nutrition 
Administrators, groups like this are involved, and the 
reason why they are involved is very simple:  This Stand for 
Children march is the latest attempt by the welfare rights 
lobby to slickly package its message.  It realizes that you 
can't talk about poor people, you can't talk about the 
welfare state, because the American public knows very well 
that the welfare state breeds dependency, breeds 
illegitimacy.

<p>

MS. NANCE [Concerned Women for America]:  If the 
choice for American women would be they would prefer to stay 
home and rear their own children, then why aren't the 
Children's Defense Fund and the National Organization for 
Women out working for women's choice?

<p>

MS. FLAHERTY [American Family Association]:
Computer technology has made pornography more accessible 
than ever before, especially to children, who in most cases 
know better how to work a computer than their parents.  Kids 
can't walk into a porn shop, but today they don't need to 
when the equivalent of an adult bookstore can be brought to 
their fingertips via the Internet.

<p>

How can we stand for children in today's world?
Parental love, caring, and involvement are vital, of course.
But it is also imperative to enact strong pornography laws
that will keep sexually explicit materials out of the hands
of children.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  While the march is carefully timed 
to influence the 1996 elections, it may not even be accurate 
to call this march partisan.  Its chief organizers are to 
the left of Clinton.  The march may well be the last gasp of 
1960s-style paleo-liberals.  Look who is absent from the 
list.  The U.S. Catholic Conference, the national body for 
the Roman Catholic Church, and the Christian Life Commission 
of the Southern Baptist Convention, the two largest 
Christian bodies in the United States, are not sponsoring 
this event.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: As we stand, let us stand up for the 
use of instructional materials that help parents and 
children establish lasting meaningful relationships, 
instructional materials such as <i>You Are Special</i> that really
will result in developing self-esteem and self-reliance in 
children, the kind that they need in order to survive and 
meet the challenges of today.

<p>

[End of FRC Stand for Children segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We now have the privilege of 
introducing some of those whom you just saw and who stood
with the Family Research Council's own Stand for Children.
I would like to welcome Dr. Mary Johnson, principal of the
D.C. Public Schools Ballou Mathematics Science Technology
Academy and author of <i>You Are Special: A Child's Guide for
Successful Living</i>.

<p>

Also joining us is Ken Weinstein, Director of the 
Government Reform Project at the Heritage Foundation; and 
Diane Knippers, president of the Institute on Religion and 
Democracy. 

<p>

Welcome. A lot of impressive organizations and 
people. I appreciate you all joining me.

<p>

In the short amount of time -- because we have so 
much to cover in our discussion of Stand for Children -- 
each of you had a special concern, and we saw just a little 
bit of that.

<p>

Dr. Johnson, let's start with you.  Why were you 
concerned when the Stand for Children rally started to 
become publicized?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON:  Well, our organization and my book, 
<i>You Are Special</i>, are very special to all of us, and 
we are very excited about getting parents involved, having 
seminars, and letting people know about the book, <i>You Are
Special</i>, because we have gotten so many positive comments 
from parents about the value of it.

<p>

So we are constantly in the public's eye talking 
about it, sharing, giving the books to mentors, and that 
kind of thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The book itself is attempting to 
build self-esteem and values through Biblical principles.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Right. So we were excited about it 
at first, and so we wrote and said we would be happy to be 
there and we would bring materials and share literature and 
whatever, and we were kind of surprised.  We got a letter 
back saying, "Well, we'll have to let you know."

<p>

So we were a little surprised at that, but we said 
okay, but we are busy telling everybody about it and passing 
out buttons, because we support anything for children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON:  Stand for Children, work for 
children, do whatever we can to help our children.

<p>

And then later, near the end of the time frame 
just before the march, we received a letter saying that they 
were sorry, that they had decided not to include us and the 
distribution of our materials.  So we were a little miffed 
at what happened.  Then we said, "Well, I'm pretty sure 
there must be some good reasons."  And then later we found 
out about other groups.  Then we really didn't know what to 
think.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is ironic that a book that Marian 
Wright Edelman gives a quote for on the back, which talks 
about the Bible, was kept out, while the Gay and Lesbian 
Victory Fund was welcome to Stand for Children.

<p>

Ken, you took a look at some of the groups that 
were there.  What made you interested in Stand for Children?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Dr. Johnson's concerns were high 
and spiritual; mine were sort of low and corporeal.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I noticed the list of national sponsors of the 
Stand for Children rally, and I noticed that a lot of them 
were feeding at the federal trough, and I did a database 
search of the groups at the Heritage Foundation, looking at 
how much in federal grants they received.

<p>

I was quite astonished to see actually how much in 
federal grants were actually represented last Saturday on 
the Mall here in Washington.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you, as a matter of fact, were 
characterizing it widely, not as a Stand for Children but --

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Well, as both the last stand for 
big government and also the stand of the social service 
administrators, since, really, they were standing for their 
own programs, particularly because they fear that the 
actions of the 104th Congress are going to change the 
welfare delivery system and take power and resources away 
from them and return it instead to citizens and the 
institutions they control.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

Diane, you were interested in some of the 
community things.  We have about less than a minute left.  
What did you notice about the community side of the event?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Well, we were particularly 
concerned about the religious angle, because there were a 
lot of religious organizations that gave more legitimacy to 
this march.  But our concern was that it really represented 
the left wing of the religious establishment, and many 
mainstream religious groups were not involved.  It gave a 
very distorted picture of this march.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more 
about all of this.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> comes back, we will 
bring you more after the commercial break. Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing the 
pro-family movement's Stand for Children with those who were 
excluded from the Children's Defense Fund recent Stand for 
Children rally.  Here tonight are Dr. Mary Johnson, Ken 
Weinstein, and Diane Knippers.

<p>

I would like to just start out -- you know, we 
briefly kind of gave an overview of the things that had 
concerned us.  What could have made the rally better --  
Diane, let's start with you this time -- in terms of making 
it the ecumenical, nonpartisan, pro-family event it was 
advertised?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Well, I had kind of a fantasy last 
week.  What if Marian Wright Edelman, who heads the 
Children's Defense Fund, had called James Dobson and said, 
"Look, let's have a genuine bipartisan, non-ideological 
Stand for Children, which I think our country really needs, 
and let's do it together."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And Dr. Dobson?  Tell us who that is.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  The head of Focus on the Family.
And very different ideas about what kinds of solutions, 
particularly from the point of view of government solutions, 
we need for children, but both apparently with a heart for 
children.

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Then maybe we would have had the 
kind of event -- or the U.S. Catholic Conference, the 
bishops of the Roman Catholic Church, or the Southern 
Baptists, the National Association of Evangelicals -- the 
largest Christian denominations in our country would have 
felt free and comfortable to really endorse.

<p>

Instead, on the religious side, you had huge 
representation of very small religious groups.  Sikhs and 
Buddhists and Muslims are not large groups in our country.
And among particularly the Protestants, the representation 
there were the churches with very liberal hierarchies.  In 
fact, four of them -- the United Methodists, the 
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Episcopal Church, and United 
Church of Christ -- the leaders of those denominations also 
signed a letter to uphold Clinton's veto of the partial-birth 
abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Astounding.  That is something that 
people of faith on the whole, Catholic and Protestant, 
abhor.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes, very highly -- standing for 
children in a very selective way; let's put it that way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ken, if you could have redesigned 
the march, I guess there would have been less federal money 
involved.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  Yes, much less federal money 
involved.  There would have been conservatives and liberals 
standing up there.  The event also would not have been held 
on the Jewish Sabbath, so Sabbath-observing Jews from the 
more conservative Jewish denominations could have 
participated rather than simply members of the left wing or 
more liberal Jewish denominations.

<p>

I would have not tried to do what Marian Wright 
Edelman did, which was to launch sort of a stealth campaign 
for the Stand for Children by meeting with the AFL-CIO's 
executive committee back in February to sort of give them a 
tip about the importance of this rally and how important it 
was -- the same meeting, by the way, that the AFL-CIO's 
executive committee voted to spend $35 million to defeat 
conservative members of the 104th Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. That is what is so 
interesting.  I loved your report, by the way --

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- and I would encourage people to
call in at the end of the show to get it.  But it was just 
very clear.  I mean, if you look at who came from a social 
perspective -- Planned Parenthood; Zero Growth Fund, 
apparently standing for fewer children; Greenpeace, I am not 
sure, standing for children who pick up trash -- and then we 
have the majority of groups being involved in federal 
monies.  I mean, what does the AFL-CIO, the labor movement, 
have to say about standing for children that Focus on the 
Family would not have to say?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Sure, absolutely.  The AFL-CIO, 
the only way that it stands for children is by standing for 
grants to its members and for government programs that 
provide jobs for its members.

<p>

But certainly AFL-CIO, by standing for the welfare 
state and by standing for the way things have been done over 
the last 30 years that have generated the real crises that 
we see today, particularly our inner cities, you know, it is 
just sort of another failed example of the liberalism that 
we have to forget about if we are going to have a future 
that our children can enjoy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Dr. Johnson, how would you have 
redesigned the march?  How could you have made it more 
ecumenical?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Well, I am not sure, but what I wish 
had happened is that everybody who has done things for 
children, have programs for children, would just be 
welcomed; that the letter that I got would have said, "We 
cannot assure you space to display anything, but come and 
bring your materials and share.  We know about your 
materials.  Bring them, share them with the parents and 
share them with others so they will know."  And everybody, 
other organizations, not just Focus on the Family, "Bring 
materials, come in, join us in any way that you can.  We 
don't know that we can provide space for you, but just come 
on and join us and bring whatever you can so that we can 
share all kinds of materials, programs, and whatever you 
have that we know will be helpful to children."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Were you concerned that your faith 
perspective -- I mean, ABC World News, for example, showed 
the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund at their special table in 
their booth handing out their materials, and then, in an 
open-air event, they said that there wasn't a table space 
for you, which seems hard to believe.  Are you concerned 
about that?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: I was down there. There was room.
There was plenty of room.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Yes, we were concerned, but we just 
didn't understand it, and we tried not to place a judgment 
on it, and we just tried to say, well, maybe there are some 
reasons that we just don't know.  We tried to look at it as 
objectively as we could.

<p>

But, yes, we were sort of amazed at the reaction. 
We thought the letter would come back and say, "Oh, come, 
do come, please come.  We want you there.  Bring your 
materials.  We know it has a religious slant, but it is not 
geared to any particular religion, and it is geared to all 
people.  It is written for all cultures, all nationalities 
and whatever," because we sent materials along with our 
initial letter.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, of course.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: "So, yes, bring it, and if you can 
find a little spot, you can find some space, you know, 
wonderful."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, I hope our listeners are going 
to have space for this book, and we're going to give an 800 
number, and again, people, you are going to want to hold 
fast to get this book.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more about the kinds of things children desperately need in 
America today.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, and we are talking to 
experts who are enlightening us on what it truly means to 
stand for children.  Welcome back to Dr. Mary Johnson, Ken 
Weinstein, and Diane Knippers.

<p>

Diane, we have been talking a little bit about
what we would have liked to have seen.  But you actually
went.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What did you see at the Stand for Children march?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Well, I started out on Friday 
night.  I went to the ecumenical service at the National 
Cathedral here in Washington, and then I went very early 
Saturday morning to a nearby Episcopal church where all the 
Episcopalians gathered.  We got a free breakfast and tee 
shirts.  I almost wore my tee shirt but decided not to.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We also got these little preprinted cards to send 
to our Senators, Representative, and to the President urging 
that we keep high levels of federal spending for children.  
These were convenient so we could send them in.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Ken is probably going to want to borrow these.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Exactly.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  The lobbying started at the 
religious events.  There were several that different 
denominations had beforehand.  When we actually got to the 
march -- I must say that it was one of the best organized, 
perhaps slickest marches I have ever been to, and with very 
effective use of children, the 2,000-children choir, the 
10,000 children crossing the bridge.  And all of this, the 
music, it was quite a celebratory event leading up to Marian 
Wright Edelman's final speech, where the bottom line was she 
got a lot of names and a lot of press coverage for a very 
one-sided political initiative that then started here in 
Washington on Monday when they started lobbying.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a person who evaluates daily and 
for a long time the impact of some of the liberal faith 
groups on politics, do you see this as being a direct 
connection between the intertwining of a liberal faith 
perspective and politics?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Oh, absolutely. In fact, it 
occurred to me that there was as much overt political 
activity at the religious events and as much or maybe more 
talk about spirituality and morality at the rally.  I mean, 
it was the same kind of thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kind of backwards, almost?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes. The homilies -- I mean, I 
kept looking anywhere for distinctive messages about moral 
messages.  In the entire 24 hours, I did not hear the word 
"divorce."  I did not hear the word "illegitimacy."  There 
was no mention of the problem of father absence, either at 
the religious events or the rally.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that is astounding.  I want to 
return to the question of father absence.

<p>

But, Dr. Johnson, in your book <i>You Are Special</i> you 
take a look at the Ten Commandments, the foundation of all 
Judeo-Christian civilized societies, and you talk about how 
to teach values.  I mean, you were there.  Did you wish that 
some messages -- what did you see and what would you have 
liked to have heard a little more about?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Well, we were there in the 
afternoon.  I would like to have seen more information and 
more focus on how to actually help our children on a day-to-
day basis.  The rally was wonderful, the march was great, 
the Stand for Children whole concept was fantastic.  But 
what comes later?  Our children need companionship with 
parents.  They need spiritual development on a day-to-day 
basis.  And our parents, because some of them are so young, 
need training themselves to help their children develop.  
And our children need time with an adult, time that has been 
set aside for them to help them.  This has to happen on a 
regular basis.

<p>

And without this kind of emphasis on helping our 
children develop and grow daily all the time, then it is 
just not going to be effective.  Nothing is going to be 
effective that does not deal with the children on a daily, 
regular basis, or regular basis, to help them develop.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So it was more of an emphasis on 
programs versus the intimate people touch that is really 
needed.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Yes, right, and that is what we are 
focusing on.  Sitting with the child with a book.  Spending 
time talking to the child.  Helping the child clarify what 
is really right and wrong, and we use the Bible as our 
basis, the Ten Commandments, other Biblical principles.  But 
parents that I have talked to say this is just so valuable, 
because it helps them to sit with their children, and they 
get a real clear understanding of what is right and what is 
wrong based on the Biblical principles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Ken, you made a very interesting 
point that for people of some faiths, you couldn't even 
participate.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: That is correct. No, orthodox 
Jews do not engage in public secular activities from sundown 
Friday till sundown Saturday, and so I spent from sundown 
Friday till -- I was in synagogue Saturday and I missed the 
rally, which I don't regret having missed, but nonetheless, 
it was -- I mean, I decided that my religion comes before my 
work, and so I didn't attend, and I know there were other 
orthodox Jews who did want to attend but couldn't because of 
the fact the rally was held on the Sabbath.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That was the nature of the event.

<p>

I want to hear more about the programs you would 
like to see when we come back.  When we return, <i>Straight
Talk</i> shares more on how you can stand for America's
children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. In light of the recent Stand 
for Children rally, we are talking to some of those who are 
truly fighting for the rights of America's children.

<p>

Ken, I wanted to start with you.  You took a look
at the programs represented at Stand for Children. What did
you find about the people who said they were standing for
children?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Sure. What they were standing for 
was an attempt to prevent any real significant welfare 
reform in the 104th Congress.  Also, they were standing for 
actually the more liberal elements, if you can believe that, 
in the Clinton Administration, trying to assure that their 
weight, that they had a stronger weight against the so-called 
new Democrats who actually push for some mild forms 
of welfare reform.

<p>

What they have done, in essence, is identify the 
plight of children with the welfare state and with the 
welfare state as it currently exists, and as we all know, it 
is the welfare state, more than just about anything, that 
has destroyed civil society in the inner city, in 
particular, destroyed churches, destroyed the healthy 
organizations that teach children character, and have also 
actually in many cases taken the place of fathers in the 
inner city by providing financial pay so that women can have 
children without men around.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Family Research Council 
got involved in evaluating Stand for Children for just that 
reason.  Our concern was that the best advocates for 
children are parents, and in fact we know in terms of early 
sex for teens and teen promiscuity that the best way to have 
children delay sex is to encourage them to talk about it 
with their moms and dads.

<p>

So instead of running a federally funded public 
service campaign that talks about moms and dads, talk to 
your kids; kids, talk to your parents; we run a dancing 
condom ad, and that just seems typical of the approach where 
we don't do family-building things.

<p>

Diane, what did you see?  I mean, what emphasis 
was there on family as the way to help kids?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: There was lip service to the family 
around the edges, but there was nothing really that gave 
support or particular advice or encouragement.

<p>

One of the things that disturbed me -- I am of the 
conviction that the major crisis facing our country, if you 
wanted to simplify it, you could say it in two words:  it is 
father absence.  There are just terrifying statistics about 
where we are headed with children being reared in single-parent 
families.

<p>

Now, this would have been a perfect opportunity to 
really lift up fathers as role models.  Instead, all the 
little vignettes of children that were in crisis, it was men 
that were the bad guys.  They were the abusers or the 
deserters of the family.  And the heroes, the people that 
intervened in the lives of children, were all women.  Now, 
we need to show men who are heroes to children and who will 
intervene.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You all are heroes, and I hope 
people are going to call to get more information about your 
organizations.  And we need to talk more about father 
absence.  Diane, we'll have to have you back.

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Thanks

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on Straight Talk we are celebrating a belated 
Father's Day.  Unfortunately, fatherhood cannot claim the 
revered position it once held in our national culture.  Not 
only do many television sitcoms make a mockery of fathers, 
but the harsh reality is that thousands upon thousands of 
America's children suffer from the absence of their own 
fathers.

<p>

Our guests tonight, who are actively researching 
and attempting to change the status of fatherhood in our 
country, will discuss the fatherhood crisis and the triumphs 
and trials of being fathers themselves. 

<p>

But first, let's hear from Family Research Council 
president Gary Bauer.  As the Presidential election draws 
near, Bob Dole and Bill Clinton are raising issues and 
debating them with America's leaders. 

<p>

In the last two weeks, Gary has been in the 
forefront of those discussions as they have played out on
the front pages on the <i>New York Times</i> to the mass media.
The present controversy has involved the sanctity of life
and the politics of abortion.  Let's hear what Gary has to
say about recent events and upsets as we take you Behind the
Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

For a lot of people who watch this show and who 
follow the Family Research Council and actually you, in 
particular, they have seen over the last two weeks 
incredible media exposure from <i>Capital Gang</i> to <i>Crossfire</i> 
to the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>. The debate has been 
about Dole and abortion, the Republican Party and the right-
to-life issue.  How would you characterize the debate as it 
stands today? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think it has been actually a 
frustrating week or two in the sense that the debate has 
gotten away from 1.5 million unborn children being aborted 
every year and has now, at least it seems inside Washington, 
gotten down to dotting I's and crossing T's in the platform. 

<p>

The issue is one of the most profound issues 
facing the country, and it deserves a more noble debate than 
a debate over the machinations of a platform committee. 

<p>

The irony is that there is this tremendous 
difference between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton on the issue.  
The President, as we all know, supports abortion on demand.  
He has even vetoed a bill that tried to limit abortions in 
the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy.  Bob Dole has a 
35-year pro-life voting record. 

<p>

So my hope is that Senator Dole will just be clear 
about that so that the American people can discern what the 
differences are between the two men. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The media likes to write process 
stories, particularly about difficult issues like abortion 
and right to life.  In the last two weeks, we have seen a 
lot of coverage on the Republican platform and whether there 
should be language on tolerance or the big tent in the 
preamble or attached to the plank itself. 

<p>

But really, it is not that simple, as simple as a 
platform.  Why, in a way, is this story a big story, and 
then why is it really not as significant as they are trying 
to make the process of the platform out to be? 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, look.  When you take a so-called 
tolerance line, which I think is a sort of bizarre way to 
say that something in your platform doesn't really mean what 
it says, but when you take that and apply it only to the 
abortion issue, the message you are sending is that you are 
really not serious about doing anything on abortion. 

<p>

The best analogy I can come up with is taxes.  The 
Republican platform will predictably say that they want 
lower taxes.  I certainly hope that they will say that.  If 
they added language to that plank that said, "However, we 
know some people disagree with us, and they are welcome in 
the party, too," the clear message the American people would 
get is, Whoops, tax aren't going down; the party is not 
serious about that issue. 

<p>

And, likewise, if you single out the abortion 
issue, which is a very profound issue, very important for 
the future of the country and who we are as a free people, 
and you add only tolerance language to that, then the 
message you are sending is that the issue really isn't that 
high on your priority list, and you are really not going to 
do anything about it. 

<p>

I think it eliminates one of the major 
vulnerabilities that Bill Clinton has.  I think he is 
extremely vulnerable in this issue if somebody will really 
take the debate to him and be clear and articulate about it. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That really is an incredible irony. 
Here we have a radically pro-abortion Democratic Party and 
the most liberal, most extreme pro-abortion President of all 
history, who embraces abortion in the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth month, even if the child is perfectly healthy, and we 
have a pro-life candidate with a 35-year voting record and a 
consistently pro-life party.  But why do you think the 
Republicans are reluctant to embrace what has been a winning 
issue?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think the main reason is the 
way this city thinks about the abortion issue.  In 
Washington, D.C., the cultural elite of the city is 
overwhelmingly pro-abortion, whether you are talking about 
the media, the political consultants that hang on and make 
their living by telling candidates what they ought to say 
and not say, the pollsters, and so forth. 

<p>

So every major politician is constantly being told 
(that) to be pro-life is an impediment.  And when you get 
out around the country and look at who gets elected, pro-
life people do extremely well.  That is one of the reasons 
we have a Republican majority in the Congress now for the 
first time since World War II.  It is one of the reasons the 
Republicans won five out of the last seven Presidential 
elections. 

<p>

You know, Kristi, the real irony here is that 
polling data out just in the last couple of days show that 
about 30 percent of the American people think that Bill 
Clinton only supports abortion in the first three months of 
the pregnancy.  This is unbelievable to me.  Here in 
Washington, we all know that President Clinton -- he is very 
about this:  he believes in abortion on demand.  There is no 
restriction on abortion in any month of the pregnancy, for 
any reason, that Bill Clinton has been willing to sign.  And 
yet because there is never a real debate on it, one-third of 
the American people think that he wants abortion fairly 
stringently restricted. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The media likes to characterize 
abortion as a women's issue, which is ironic, because in 
polling women consistently are shown to be more pro-life.  
And if we look at people who are single-issue voters, the 
abortion issue, in terms of the right-to-life position, 
pulls 2 to 1 as an advantage for a candidate who takes that 
issue.

<p>

Why do you think, though, that the media tries to 
say abortion is a gender gap issue for Dole? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, no, it is not responsible at 
all; in fact, this poll is no surprise.  There has not been 
one poll in 20 years of polling -- and I have looked for 
every one of them -- that has ever shown that it is the 
abortion issue that costs a politician or a party female 
votes, because as you just indicated, on balance it ends up 
being a net plus for whatever candidate or party takes that 
position. 

<p>

I think the gender gap has got a lot to do with 
some of the budget cuts which the Republican Party 
legitimately tried to make, but polling data for years has 
also shown that women tend to get nervous when you are 
talking about cutting budgets, particularly when the 
programs being cut have some indirect effect on women or 
children or the elderly or the sick.  And that is 
understandable.  Women tend to be more sensitive about those 
sorts of things.  So I think that the economic cuts, the 
economic agenda of the party, has a lot more to say about 
the gender gap than the social issues do.

<p>

Interestingly, the polling shows that there is one 
group in America that is overwhelmingly supportive of 
abortion on demand, and that group is men between the ages 
of 18 and 25, and I would suggest that that is nothing a 
politician should be proud about.  The reason men between 
the ages of 18 and 25 support abortion on demand is it makes 
it easier for them to run away from their responsibilities 
when they get a woman pregnant.  When that woman comes to 
them and says that she needs help or wants that man to stand 
up to do the responsible thing, he can throw his hands up 
and say, "Wait a minute.  I have nothing to do with this 
from this point on.  You have a right to abort.  Utilize 
that right.  That's the end of it." 

<p>

So it has been a real boon for young men.  It has 
been terrible for women and children, and I think 
politicians ought to be clear about who has benefitted from 
abortion on demand and who hasn't. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It has been a very fiery debate for 
you, Gary, in the last two weeks.  In fact the front page of 
the <i>New York Times</i> shows Senator Dole attacking you for your 
pro-life stance.  You have had a long history in Washington. 
It seems strange to suddenly find that objectionable.  Why 
do you think that Senator Dole did attack you personally? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Kristi, I have no idea. I have worked 
closely with Senator Dole.  It is a little unusual, I think, 
for him to attack me for defending a platform plank that he 
says he believes in.  That doesn't make any sense to me at 
all.  But I have worked with him in the past; I am sure I 
will work with him in the future.

<p>

We do have, though, a core set of issues that we 
stand for:  the sanctity of life, the importance of the 
family, traditional values, teaching children reliable 
standards of right and wrong.  And the only credibility I 
can ever have in Washington is if I am consistent in 
standing for those things, even if on any given day it might 
irritate one politician or another.  Now, usually it 
irritates liberal Democrats; in this case, it irritated a 
conservative Republican.  But I can't start fine-tuning the 
core set of values that we have to satisfy people that are 
running for office.  That would quickly end any influence 
whatsoever that I could ever have in Washington. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  For the most part, the media has 
ignored the abortion and right-to-life controversy in the 
Democratic Party. Sunday in the <i>Washington Post</i>, there was 
an article of Democratic Party leaders and office holders 
saying, "Look, we have a pro-life side as well, and we, the 
pro-life members of the Democratic Party, want to address 
our convention."

<p>

You have been advising pro-life candidates for a 
long time, Democratic and Republican and independent.  How 
would you advise someone on how to handle the sanctity-of-life 
issue?  How does someone need to play that to have 
success? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Sure. The American people are deeply 
divided over the issue, so I never want to suggest that it 
is an easy issue to handle.  But I think if you believe in 
the sanctity of human life, as I do, that you can't run from 
it.  You can't try to be all things to all people. 

<p>

I guess I go back to the man that will probably be 
my favorite President for the rest of my life, and that is 
Ronald Reagan.  Ronald Reagan was unambiguous about this.  
He was gentle in describing his position.  He wasn't harsh. 
He didn't attack women, certainly, because women have been 
exploited by this as much as anyone has.  But he was clear 
about it.  He was clear that he firmly believed that unborn 
children deserved constitutional protection, and he won one 
of the biggest landslides in American history, even though 
everyone in the country knew that was his position. 

<p>

That's the model that I would recommend to Bob 
Dole or to somebody running for the Senate or the House or 
even for a local city council race.  State your position 
clearly, do it fairly, do it with a sense of compassion.  
But don't ever run away from the defense of innocent human 
life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Gary, for being with us 
today on Behind the Headlines. 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> begins our discussion of fatherhood.  What 
does it take to be a good father?  Stay tuned to hear how 
our guests answer that crucial question. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from Promise Keepers, RFK Stadium, May 25, 1996, follows:]

<p>

DR. CANALES: Whenever you are weak as a father, 
whenever you don't have what it takes as a husband, whenever 
you feel insecure, whenever you feel inadequate, whenever 
you feel like you don't have any strength, whenever you feel 
like you're not being a good enough dad, I want you to know 
that you can trust in God and He will bring you through and 
make up the difference for you and bring you out of Egypt 
into a strong and mighty situation and give you the strength 
you need to be a good dad. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Please say Amen.

<p>

MEN [Attendees]: Amen.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Right now I want you to do something 
with me.  I want you to take out your wallet, and I'm not 
going to tell you to give your neighbor money, and I'm not 
going to take up an offering, which I know you think I am, 
but I'm not.  I just want you to look at your pictures.
Take out your wallet if you've got some pictures.  Look at 
your wife and at your kids, if you've got them right there, 
and show them to your neighbor, all right?  Would you love 
them unconditionally?  Men, would you love them 
unconditionally?

<p>

MEN: Yes.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Do they have to perform for you to 
love them? 

<p>

MEN: No.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  No.  Everybody say no!

<p>

MEN: No.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Say "I" --

<p>

MEN:  I -- 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Love" --

<p>

MEN:  Love --

<p>

DR. CANALES: "Them."

<p>

MEN:  Them. 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Unconditionally." 

<p>

MEN:  Unconditionally. 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Not for what they do" --

<p>

MEN:  Not for what they do --

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Or don't do."

<p>

MEN:  Or don't do.

<p>

DR. CANALES: "But for who they are."

<p>

MEN:  But for who they are.

<p>

MAN [Attendee]:  A father needs to be a man of 
integrity, a man of his word, show love for his children, 
his family, his wife, real concern for the things of God. 

<p>

MAN: I think a father should be a man who follows 
after the Lord.  He ought to be somebody who understands the 
word of God and tries to live it.  He should be somebody who 
cares about his family, his wife and his children, and is 
willing to sacrifice anything to take care of them.  Most of 
all, he cares for his children to the point that he wants 
them to be raised up to be godly women and godly men. 

<p>

BOY:  I love you, Dad. 

<p>

MAN:  I love you too, buddy. 

<p>

MAN:  Special father qualities.  Love.  I mean, to 
really be able to understand love and listen to your 
children. 

<p>

MAN:  Important characteristics that a father 
should have, I believe, are very much the ones that my 
father had, and that's just a man of integrity, a man of 
honesty, a man who's really faithful to his family and also 
a loving father who really loves his kids. 

<p>

MAN:  I guess the first one would be humble and 
understanding and able to accept their children no matter 
what, just to love them for who they are.  That's really 
important. 

<p>

MAN:  I think a father needs to be real and one 
that can show affection and love. 

<p>

YOUNG MAN:  I love you and I'm sorry about all the 
problems we've had. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MAN:  Loving, warm, gentle, comforting, and more 
importantly, a listening ear for our children, and to be 
around them and caring. 

<p>

MAN: A father should be very loyal to his kids, 
love them unconditionally, be there for them no matter what, 
supporting them when things go well and when they don't go 
maybe as well as they would have liked and just know that, 
no matter what, we're always there for them. 

<p>

[End of Promise Keepers segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we just saw, fatherhood requires 
a lot from men, and tonight's guests are here to discuss why 
many fathers have neglected that crucial role in their 
children's lives. 

<p>

I would like to welcome Terry Allen, chief of 
staff for Representative Steve Largent and father of five; 
Armstrong Williams, whom many viewers already know as a
television and radio talk show host and syndicated columnist
whose touching <i>USA Today</i> article honored his own father.

<p>

Also joining us is Bill Mattox, whom many of you 
know, FRC's Vice President for Policy, who consistently has 
made fatherhood a headlining issue and directed a national 
fatherhood campaign called Being a Dad is Important 
Business.  I would like to welcome all of you, a couple of 
days after Father's Day.

<p>

Bill, you wrote an Op-Ed not too long ago talking 
about how, on Father's Day, you get the joke cards; on 
Mother's Day you get the honoring and revering of motherhood 
and all that it is.  Why do fathers seem to get such a bad 
rap? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: Well, you know, it's funny. There 
really is a very different quality to the types of cards 
that people give at Father's day.  I mean, you do see 
sentimental cards on both occasions, but it's rare that you 
see Mother's Day cards that have any kind of joke, or if 
there is some sort of humor involved, it quite often will 
take shots at Dad, whereas it's quite routine for fathers to 
be the butt of jokes in the Father's Day cards. 

<p>

I think some of this is probably a reflection of 
the fact that men open themselves up to that kind of abuse 
by failing to sometimes come off swiftly in their duties in 
the home.  But I think a lot of it is just a reflection of 
the fact that we expect fathers to kind of roll with the 
punches and to be able to mix it up with us. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Broad shoulders.

<p>

MR. MATTOX: Yes, and want, as you say, to kind of 
keep mothers in a revered status.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Fathers don't seem to get that.

<p>

Armstrong, your column was very revering, very 
reverent, and I am going to encourage people to call and get 
a copy of it.  But as you look at your own father and at 
fatherhood in general, why do you think that fathers don't 
often get the tribute you wrote for your own dad? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, statistics would bear out 
that 70 percent of adolescent murderers are born into 
fatherless homes.  Sixty percent of American rapists come 
from fatherless homes.  I mean kids who don't do well in 
school and who have low self-esteem don't have a father in 
the home. 

<p>

And for me it was not a decision that I made; it 
was a decision that my parents made.  They took their 
marriage vows very seriously, for sickness or in health, for 
better or for worse, and till death do them part. 

<p>

The problem is not for me as a man.  I grew up 
with a father, so obviously, growing up with a father, all 
my adolescent life, obviously, I want to emulate that.  You 
only repeat the tape that's in the home. 

<p>

And with so many households today without fathers, 
many kids feel it's the norm, and you have it reinforced by 
television, by the movies, that, well, this is the norm.  
And a lot of mothers will say today, "I did a fine job.  I 
never missed a man."  But that is not true.  It takes two 
parents to raise a child. 

<p>

But this started 30 or 40 years ago, and unless we 
get back to teaching through the church and through other 
organizations that the best home is with a mother and a 
father, and to restore the man in his proper place, then it 
will never change; it will only get worse. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Terry, I thought it was an 
interesting contrast recently when Susan Molinari comes back 
to Congress with her child and is very welcomed.  I thought 
of all the men laboring as fathers rather unremarkedly.  You 
know, women are having children and they're coming in and 
working, and it's hardly discussed at all.  You know, you're 
in a place where there's a lot of work hours.  How is 
fatherhood viewed up on the Hill and in official Washington? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, I think it is better than it 
used to be.  I think there is at least an attempt to have a 
family-friendly, or at least there's --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More of an attempt.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  -- more of an attempt, at least an 
acknowledgement that we need to have a family-friendly 
Congress.  Whether or not we are actually there -- certainly 
in 1995 that was not the case; in 1996, the schedule is a 
little better and the hours are not as late. 

<p>

But I think, generally, it is not that different 
from where you have the attitude in corporate America or in 
society in general that, as Bill said, generally does not 
take the role of nurturer or provider as seriously; at least 
fathers are not thought of in that role as much as women 
are, and so it is a reflection of the attitude that 
individual fathers have that they are more expendable or 
they are more -- you know, if they work late, it's not that 
important, but if Mom works late, boy, the kids really feel 
it, because she is the primary care-giver.  And it's a 
reflection of the attitudes of our society and culture. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> Work and 
Family column has made a big deal in the last couple weeks, 
and the last two months in particular, about men getting on 
the daddy track; you know, CEOs resigning.

<p>

But do you think that's a real trend?  Are men 
maybe just publicly reevaluating a little more, or are they 
really getting on a daddy track? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS: You know, it is true that you have 
a lot of households with both parents.  But you have 
absentee fathers.  I remember a story someone was telling me 
that there was this father who is a CEO, who is very busy, 
and he had planned to spend his kid's birthday with him for 
months in advance, and it was a 16th birthday. 

<p>

But then, all of a sudden, he got this speaking 
engagement that was going to pay him $1,000, but more 
importantly than the money, it would have afforded him an 
opportunity to sort of rub shoulders with the people that 
could really advance his career. 

<p>

And so, three weeks before the engagement, he met 
with his son and said, "Look, this engagement has come up.
I didn't realize it, but it's something that is very 
beneficial for me and it's going to help my career, so I'll 
cut a deal with you.  I'll give you the $1,000 and I'll go 
make the speech."

<p>

And the son said, "No, Dad, you keep the money.
It's more important that I spend the day with you." 

<p>

And that's a lot of what's going on, and I don't 
think it's that CEOs need to go back home and play nurturer; 
it's that they need to understand that they need to spend 
quality time with their children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  They need to just come home in general.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Right. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Rather than quit their job. 

<p>

What do you think, Bill?  Is there a daddy track? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: I think that there is a reevaluation 
taking place among really both women and men, but I think 
particularly among men, because if you look -- especially I 
was noticing the clip on Promise Keepers -- if you go and 
talk to many of the individuals there, you'll find that 
among that kind of baby boomer cohort, there are a number of 
men who perceive that somehow they missed out and that they 
would like to devote more of their time and energy and 
attention to rearing children than perhaps their fathers 
did.

<p>

I am not altogether certain that some of the 
criticism that is often levied against the fathers of old is 
justified.  But I do think it's a healthy thing that many 
men today are taking these responsibilities more seriously 
and do appear to be willing to at least consider sacrifices 
that might not have been considered proper a generation or 
more ago. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, and I 
wanted you all to respond quickly. <i>Newsweek</i>, I think, had a 
front-page and cover story on fathering, and they said that 
today's men universally think that they are better equipped 
to be fathers and are better dads.  Do you think we're 
raising a better generation of fathers, or has the self-esteem 
curriculum leaked into our national fatherhood debate?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  That's not politically correct. 

<p>

I don't think <i>Newsweek</i> could be further from the 
truth.  I think the dads of yesteryear were better; they 
were more disciplinarian, and plus they did not have to 
compete with the media culture of today.  I mean, parents 
have a lot to compete with, with music, with entertainment, 
and with the kids' culture, the environment that they are 
in.  So, no, I would not agree with <i>Newsweek</i> on that 
predictor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to come back 
and hear the comments of the other two of you. 

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more after this 
commercial break.  Don't go away. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are celebrating 
fatherhood, and I am joined by Terry Allen, chief of staff 
for Representative Steve Largent; Armstrong Williams, who 
spans all media as a television and radio talk show host and 
syndicated columnist; and Bill Mattox, the Family Research 
Council's Vice President for Policy.  Welcome back. 

<p>

We were kind of talking about <i>Newsweek</i>'s 
assessment that today's dad is empowered to be the best dad 
that he can be.  Terry, what do you think?  I mean, have we 
invented a better father than the men of the 1940s and 1950s 
or even their ancestors?

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  I don't think so.  I hope so, but 
today's fathers are competing with a media that is openly 
hostile at times to the values that so many fathers want to 
instill in their children.  I know I run up against that.  
You know, we have a 6:30 hour where it is kind of after 
homework but before dinner and this kind of limbo time where 
the television shows that used to come on were <i>Happy Days</i>
and <i>Laverne and Shirley</i>, and now they are shows that I 
really have to watch for my children to pick up on things 
that I don't want them to hear. So it's tough. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  Right around that hour you get 
<i>The Simpsons</i> with the inevitable buffoon father.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Yes, exactly, and <i>Married with
Children</i> and some of those.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  [Unintelligible] the ones that you 
don't pick up on. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, right.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  So fathers are competing against a lot 
today that they didn't have to compete with 30 years ago. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. At least father knew something, even if he 
didn't always know best.

<p>

Bill, what do you think?  I mean, have we got the 
perfect genetic dad now? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: No. I think it is very difficult to 
argue that at a time when four out of ten kids are going to 
bed every night living in a home without a father present 
that we have somehow reached an age or an era in which we 
have responsible fatherhood to the max.  We are certainly 
far short of that. 

<p>

I do think, however, that there is a subpopulation 
of fathers that, in light of all the problems around and in 
light of some of the challenges that are facing them, are 
perhaps stepping up to the plate in a new and different and 
perhaps better way than men of a previous generation, not 
that men of a previous generation wouldn't have done so, but 
that the circumstances were different, the surrounding 
culture was much more favorable.  The need for strong 
fathers and strong mothers may not have been as great. 

<p>

And so I do think that there is at least a 
subpopulation that is taking this stuff very seriously, and 
that gives us a glimmer of hope when we look at the 
magnitude of some of the problems that are caused by 
fatherlessness. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS: You know, and the other thing is, 
too, long ago you never had the kind of dysfunctional 
families that you have today, and that fathers would abandon 
their children was unheard of; nor did you have women who 
would be so boisterous about being pregnant and carrying 
somebody's child that they were not married to. 

<p>

And I would not even fool myself -- I don't know 
about Terry and everybody else here -- I would never 
convince myself that I could be a better parent, a better 
father than my father.  I would not even try to fool myself 
to say that I can achieve what my father achieved, because 
to me it is almost virtually impossible.  The course, the 
game has changed. 

<p>

You have to be more tolerant.  I mean, you have 
laws that say you cannot discipline your children.  Your 
child can file an abuse suit against you.  I mean, there are 
all kinds of things more important, which is the law.  The 
law makes it difficult for you to be a parent today, and you 
have to contend with that.

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think even what is a good father 
has lost its definition.  My own father, father of six -- I 
have to say, "Hey, Dad" -- when he would say, "How do I know 
that I love you?" in addition to all that he said, he would 
tell us, "Watch what I do.  You have food on the table, you 
have clothes on your back.  I am faithful to your mother.  
That's how you know that I love you."  And I heard him say 
that a million times, defining his love by his action. 

<p>

But today fathering can be defined as money, it 
can be defined as quality time, which I am not exactly sure 
what that is -- maybe you all do -- but how do you define 
what is a good father?  You know, our culture seems to 
picture a guy with a big credit card. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  There's a great deal of confusion on 
this question in our culture.  I think that we are 
comfortable seeing Dad take on all kinds of new roles, if 
you would look at least at some of the women's magazines and 
that kind of thing.  But I think that there is a failure to 
appreciate some of the unique and irreplaceable 
contributions that men make to family life and the fact that 
mothers and fathers are not intended to be interchangeable. 

<p>

I think one of the things that is beginning to 
stir in some of the discussion taking place at least among 
people in this town and in other places around the country 
is a kind of renewed appreciation and recognition that 
fathers do bring something different to the table and that 
we want them to. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do they bring? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Well, I think one of the things that 
they bring is the ability to help young children, especially 
boys, learn to develop self-control, especially over their 
kind of physical bodies and what not.  I mean, the scene of 
a dad, say, wrestling on the floor with children has, I 
think, in many ways been kind of seen as a nice little 
playful thing that doesn't really have a great deal of 
importance. 

<p>

But, instead, if you listen to some of the 
developmental psychologists, they'll tell you that, no, that 
sort of interplay, which we would never expect, really, of a 
mom, to be down on the floor wrestling, is quite important 
from the standpoint of helping boys to understand that they 
can use some of their aggressive tendencies in constructive 
ways but that there are limits and that when they cross 
lines and they kick or they bite or they punch in ways that 
are inappropriate, that there will be ramifications, there 
will be consequences. 

<p>

And if those lessons are taught in that kind of 
setting, then we don't often see boys of 14, 15, 16 out 
raping and pillaging. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's true. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  When boys, however, are deprived of 
that kind of instruction, it's not at all surprising, then, 
that their aggressive masculine tendencies would spill over 
into all kinds of destructive social behavior. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think, Terry?  That is 
fascinating.  What's the mark of a good father?  You know, 
wrestling, playing with the children and bringing something 
different to the table. 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  I would have to say someone primarily 
who takes his responsibilities seriously.  You know, the 
technique, being a father is a relationship, and it takes 
time and it takes practice, and it is in the context of that 
relationship that you are a father. 

<p>

But, first and foremost, the commitment to be a 
father and to stay a father is primarily, I think, the most 
important thing, and that commitment over time will manifest 
itself in a myriad of different ways and forms and things 
that you as a father may not even pick up on.  But the fact 
that you're there, you're consistently there, and you're 
learning to work out your own faults and helping your 
children learn to grow and be mature and act responsibly, 
that in and of itself is profound, I think. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  You know, I think -- and I can only 
go back to my own childhood and my involvement with a lot of 
young men -- I think the most important thing that a father 
can do is teach his child that he is imperfect, that he does 
not have all the answers, and that the foundation of 
everything is in the Ten Commandments of the Bible. 

<p>

"And yet, when I'm not with you," as my father 
used to say to me, "when I'm not with you and you fall short 
and you're in a situation and you don't know what to do, you 
go to those laws and those commandments," which were etched 
in my heart.

<p>

When you teach your child that -- it is critical 
that a father teaches his child an example of discipline, 
work ethic, love for humanity, and routine.  A child, 
especially a young man, must have routine in their life.  
Especially a young man should not have idle time.  You must 
teach that child to work. 

<p>

And another thing that a father should do -- and I 
am sure these gentlemen may agree with me -- is that my 
father always taught us that no young man should ever be in 
bed past 8 a.m. in the morning.  A young man should be up. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: He rises and works.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  If he has nothing to do, he should 
find something to do.  Those are very important lessons that 
can lead to big things. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: My father was on your team, believe me.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear more about 
the joys and trials of fatherhood.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[National Fatherhood Initiative PSA.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Like the National Fatherhood 
Initiative, which gave us the fatherhood public service 
announcement which we just saw, the men joining me today are 
actively working to restore respect to fatherhood.  Welcome 
back to Terry Allen, Armstrong Williams, and Bill Mattox. 

<p>

There is a tremendous love in Washington of 
government fixes for societal problems, and there are some 
things that government can do, perhaps more limited than it 
thinks.  But what can government do to help men in their 
desire to be good fathers or just to increase the profile of 
fatherhood? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, there's two things we can do 
first off, right away.  First is end the penalty for intact 
families that we have in our public assistance programs.  We 
talked about the tragedy of fatherless children and broken 
homes.  We are actually, in federal policy, encouraging 
that, promoting that, and penalizing intact families through 
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, which 
is more commonly known as welfare, and other public 
assistance programs.

<p>

And that is a tragedy.  And that has driven the 
demographic on the number of children that are in broken 
homes.  It's a tragedy.  It has to be stopped.  It was fixed 
in the welfare reform bill.  It was vetoed twice.  Enough 
said. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Not surprisingly.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  The second thing that we can do is we 
can address the family time famine, which the Family 
Research Council has talked a lot about, that basically in 
1950 the average family spent 2 percent of its income in 
federal taxes; today they spend 24 percent of its income in 
federal taxes.  That has driven the need for a second 
income, which creates all types of challenges for parents 
who struggle to raise children and spend time with their 
children.  So we have a famine of time that we are trying to 
find to spend with our kids. 

<p>

Those are two federal policies that we can fix 
right now to address that issue that are driving the 
demographics on fatherless families. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I was interested to see that the 
average second earner in a family, which is normally the 
woman, is bringing in around 30 percent of the family's 
overall budget, which is the tax burden of the average 
American family.  Astounding if you think about it. 

<p>

Anything else that government can do?  Or maybe 
the best thing it could do is stay out. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, the government should 
encourage marriage instead of rewarding promiscuity, which 
it does, and the government should also realize that the 
best department of health, education, and welfare is a two-
parent family, and the best that the government can do is 
encourage that through its policies by giving more power to 
parents over their children and over their families; by 
giving more tax breaks to families, and is something that it 
doesn't do. 

<p>

And in the name of compassion, even with a lot of 
government programs, with these programs, especially welfare 
and the Great Society programs, it has done more to 
discourage fathers from being in the home than anything 
else.  What kind of policy would say to you that unless the 
father is able to pay child support, then and only then can 
they have any kind of interaction with that child?  Whether 
that parent can afford to pay child support or not should be 
of least importance if that father wants to spend time with 
that child.  That child needs that father interacting with 
him on a daily basis so he can see that man, because women 
cannot teach boys how to be men.  Only a man can do that. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And, you know, you are never going 
to hear that in the cultural debate today.  I mean, men have 
been reduced to money.  If money comes in from the 
government, therefore, there is no need for men. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  We have talked to families and we 
have talked to kids, and we have talked to kids who have had 
fathers pay the money but yet they were absent, and the kids 
will tell you later on in life, "That's meaningless to me.
I didn't need the money.  I needed a father."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  Can the government do 
anything, Bill, or can the government get out of the way? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Well, I think that Armstrong is 
right, that there is a need for government policymakers to 
look for ways to strengthen and encourage marriage, and I am 
encouraged by the fact that a number of states are currently 
looking at divorce laws and seeking to make reforms that 
would make it difficult, if not impossible, for one spouse 
to unilaterally walk away from a marriage and leave the 
other spouse high and dry without any kind of legal 
recourse. 

<p>

I understand that there are a lot of families that 
have difficult times and are going through struggles and all 
of that, but I think it's important that we take seriously 
those marriage vows and that the state stand behind the 
promises that have been made from one spouse to the other 
and encourage as much as possible some type of 
reconciliation when problems do arise. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you find most encouraging in 
the national discussion of fatherhood that is taking place 
right now?  Because there are a lot more articles out there 
now.  Is there any encouraging data for people who are 
saying, you know, we've got fatherlessness as one of the 
greatest pathologies of all time facing our culture?  
Anything encouraging out there that you see? 

<p>


MR. WILLIAMS:  You know, I don't know if you 
realize this, but 80 percent of the time, when a father is 
given visitation rights with his children, he pays his money 
and he is active in the child's life.  Ninety percent of the 
time when he is given visitation rights and they both have 
legal rights to the child, they are active, and many times 
they end up maybe getting back with the mother.  But it has 
made a difference in the child's life and a difference in 
the growth.  So we need to encourage that. 

<p>

The sad thing about it -- and I don't want to 
blame this on liberalism -- we need to admit in this society 
that even though we tried policies, the whole thing to 
uplift mankind, a lot of these policies have done more harm 
than good, and we need to go back and look at these laws, 
and if these laws have not worked, if they have discouraged 
families, we need to change these laws.  We need to have the 
courage to say that we were wrong and to abandon some of 
these ideas and laws of the past.  And no one is willing to 
have the courage to step forward, because when you do, they 
will say you lack compassion.  And so people don't have the 
courage anymore to step up -- we need real men and women in 
society to stand up and say, "Hey, this does not work.  It 
doesn't matter what you call me.  Vilify me now, but the 
children will be the true winners in the future." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We saw here in Washington, D.C., the 
Million Man March.  We saw here recently Promise Keepers, a 
national men's movement.  Do you think that the growth of 
these men's movements is going to help get men involved?  
Terry? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Yes, I do.  I hope, and I have seen, 
and I am sure you have seen and we have all seen some of 
that on a local level around the country, Promise Keepers 
gatherings all across the country.  It is one of those 
movements that has kind of just caught on.  It is beyond the 
expectations of the founders of the organization now, and 
they are scratching where people are itching, and that is 
encouraging to know that men are starting to take their 
responsibility seriously and there is a willingness to 
discuss, Hey, what are my responsibilities as a father?  And 
even those fathers that are committed, they are willing to 
ask, Well, are there greater commitments that maybe I 
haven't really even considered?  And that is helpful. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to go around.  I am 
sorry, we are kind of coming near the end, unless, Bill, you 
want to add one other comment.  What I would like is if you 
all -- we have a couple, just about a minute and a half left 
-- would give the best piece of advice or a great piece of 
advice that your father gave you.  You know, this is our 
Father's Day tribute, so this is an opportunity for you all 
to give a tribute to your father. 

<p>

I could say that the best thing that my dad ever 
said to me is that work is good.  You know, it's not a bad 
thing; it's not a punishment.  Work is good, and so work. 

<p>

Bill, what would you say? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  I think the thing, the virtue that I 
think stands out most in what I think of my father is 
honesty.  He was incredibly -- I mean, he was an admissions 
officer at a major university and actually told one of my 
sisters, "Don't even bother to apply because I'm not going 
to cut you any special slack, and you don't make the grade." 

<p>

Well, you know, leaving aside whatever you may 
think of that, at the end of the day, he was someone who 
really did things by the book, who really believed in having 
integrity and being honest, and that is something that I 
think we don't see enough of these days. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to go quickly. 

<p>

Armstrong, your dad's best advice? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  The best advice from my father was 
that God created us all equal, even though sometimes we may 
be treated (un)equally.  No matter what the hue of our skin 
may be, or our gender, we are all the same, and you judge 
people by their hearts, not by what they look like. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Great advice.  Terry, you're quick and last.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, more than the advice would be 
the example he gave of just being someone who is faithful, 
who has integrity and is consistent across the board with 
everything he did and said. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much, all of you. 

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about 
the plight of America's families.  Please don't go away. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

Unfortunately, America's children suffer the loss 
of fathers primarily through divorce, a topic that was 
discussed in a Family Research Council press conference 
highlighting the Annual Family Issues Survey.  Let's hear 
more as we bring you some Homefront News. 

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>

[Segment from FRC Family Issues Survey Press 
Conference November 21, 1995, follows:] 

<p>

COL. MAGINNIS:  Divorce.  Well, divorce is 
approaching about 50 percent of all marriages in this 
country, and it is devastating families from coast to coast. 
And we have found that divorce laws in virtually every state 
in this country give more legal right to the person seeking 
the divorce than for the spouse that wants to try to keep 
the family together. 

<p>

Now, when we asked all Americans, we found that 55 
percent of them favor legislation that would reverse this 
situation. 

<p>

Also, in divorce cases that are based on adultery 
or on abuse, we found that three out of four Americans say 
we want to favor the abused spouse by giving the abused 
spouse custody over children.  They want legislation to do 
that. 

<p>

And a majority indicate that they favor giving the 
non-philandering spouse more than half of the couple's 
property and, not surprisingly, as Bill pointed out earlier, 
we found that the divorce reform is particularly strong 
amongst those that are weekly church goers. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  I do want to add one little footnote 
to that point that the colonel made about the divorce 
reform, and that is, not only are the religiously devout 
more likely than the average Americans to support such 
measures, divorce reform measures, but, interestingly, those 
in that 20-something generation, the generation X crowd, 
have a higher than average level of support for divorce 
reform measures.  This, I think, is quite likely a 
reflection of the fact that many of them have, themselves, 
experienced some of the negative fallout of their parents' 
divorce and are looking for ways in which to undergird 
marital stability. 

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are bringing you an issue which
touches the life of every mother and father.  Parental
rights have slowly diminished in our schools and our
culture, sometimes through the growth of the social worker 
state, sometimes through the courts.  Little by little, 
these rights have been placed in the hands of teachers, 
social workers, judges, and bureaucrats.  The politically 
correct mentality seems to find parents guilty until proven 
innocent.

<p>

We will show you exclusive clips from Congressman 
Steve Largent's staff briefing regarding the Parental Rights 
and Responsibilities Act.  You will hear the shocking story 
of a father of an 11-year-old girl who underwent a genital 
exam at her school without the consent or prior notification 
of her parents.

<p>

To help us understand why parents are fighting for 
their inherent rights to lovingly guide their own children, 
I had the opportunity to talk to representatives from 
several state policy councils who are increasingly hearing 
parents' cries for help. Let's take a look.

<p>

I am joined first -- let me go around, ladies 
first -- by Linda Dealy, who is on the board of directors of 
Capital Resource Institute in California; and then Joe 
Clark, who is executive director of the Illinois Family 
Institute.  We go to Steve Knudsen, who is director of state 
and local affairs for the Family Research Council and 
recently joined Family Research Council after heading a 
Texas FPC.

<p>

To my right, we have John Paulton of the South 
Dakota Family Policy Council; then Bill Brooks of the North 
Carolina Family Policy Council; and finally, last but not 
least, Paul Sienna of the Family Policy Center in Missouri.
A wonderful state, I vacation there often.

<p>

But Steve, let's go to you first.  You were at the 
local level, taking a look at parents' issues.  Now you are 
in Washington, D.C.  There are a lot of things that you 
could choose to have on your plate, but we are looking at 
parental rights and responsibilities.  Why?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Well, it is interesting, Kristi.
Our first lady has talked a lot about it takes a village, 
and I happen to think that is taking an African proverb 
somewhat out of context.  I think what that proverb is 
trying to say was that a village should support a parent as 
it raises its child.  What she is suggesting is that the 
village should raise the child.  So we have a situation here 
where governmental entities across our country are trying to 
take more and more of the child-raising responsibilities 
away from parents.  So we really need to find a way to alter 
that and actually stem the tide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  This week, on Sunday as a matter of 
fact, the Democratic leadership introduced its family plan, 
and what is always interesting -- I mean, we are not having 
a partisan discussion here -- but so many Democratic family 
plans involve them saying this is what I am going to do for 
your family or maybe to your family, while a lot of 
Republican approaches have been this is how we are going to 
empower parents.

<p>

The Family Rights and Responsibilities Act for 
some people is difficult to understand, but how would you 
all describe it, and in particular, how do you describe it 
to the people you are talking to?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  When we talk about this particular 
issue in California, the thing that I really try to bring 
home every time is that it is called the Family Rights and 
Responsibility Act because rights and responsibilities go 
hand in hand.  When you have a responsibility for something, 
you should also have the right to fulfill that 
responsibility.  When you have a right to something, every 
right carries with it a certain amount of responsibility, 
and that is exactly where parents need to be and should be 
and should be free to be is the ones that are directly 
responsible for the oversight and raising of their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Where in your states have you seen 
the line crossed?  You know, if we are saying in the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act that parents are 
being encroached, you know, their territory is being seized, 
where are we seeing it seized?

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, we have seen it in North 
Carolina in recent years just through giving social services 
more authority.  One of the things, of course, that goes 
along with the parental responsibility is the necessity to 
exercise that responsibility, and where we see that not 
exercised in society, there is always the tendency to step 
in and say, well, what can be done, and if you are the 
government, if you have a mindset that this is the 
government's problem, then the cure is going to be 
governmental, and we do not always think, particularly when 
it comes to basic rights of parents and children, that that 
is the appropriate response.

<p>

We have seen situations where social services has 
the ability to drive by a neighborhood and basically make a 
decision on a child being in an inappropriate situation and 
then taking action to do something about that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you are saying they would, like, 
drive through a neighborhood and say this home looks 
inappropriate; perhaps we should check further?

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Well, or you may have a situation 
where a neighbor calls up and says, well, I saw Mr. Wood 
spank his child in the front yard, and all of a sudden 
social services shows up, takes the child into protective 
custody until they investigate the situation.  So the parent 
automatically is put on the defensive, instead of the 
presumption being that the parent was exercising what was in 
the best right of the child.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Kristi, before we go any further, I 
would like to draw a distinction between the Parental Rights 
Amendment movement, which is underway in about 28 or 29 
states right now, as well as the federal legislation, which 
is different, and that is underway here, sponsored by Steve 
Largent.

<p>

As you look at the state initiative, so far it has 
not passed in any state.  It is very difficult to pass 
amendments through general assemblies at the state level, 
and probably Colorado is further along than anyone at this 
point.  They have an initiative underway there by the voters 
of that state.  In Illinois this year, we got it through the 
executive committee of the senate, and the night before 
there was to be a vote by our full senate, in talking with 
the senate leadership decided not to call it for a vote, 
because it was very iffy, very problematic, as to whether or 
not we had that vote.

<p>

But the major distinction here that I want to make 
is that each state has slightly different language.  For 
example, ours read that the fundamental right of parents to 
direct the upbringing and education of their children shall 
not be infringed. Colorado's is different.  What is going 
on in other states is a little bit different, as well, and I 
assume we will come back and talk about the language to the 
federal legislation.

<p>

But as you look at the examples that have brought 
about the need for this, ours tend to be much more in 
education, and we have time after time seen situations 
similar to what Bill mentioned, except where educators have 
intervened in families, and probably one of the more 
flagrant ones that I recall was actually given as testimony 
at one of the hearings that was held by our legislators in 
Springfield was the Milar[?] family down in Champaign.  This 
was a family that was abiding by state law which says you 
can opt out of objectionable sex education programs.  The 
regional superintendent and the principal for that area, for 
that school, had decided to test this apparently, and so 
they refused to let them opt out.

<p>

We had to get the Rutherford Institute and some 
pro bono attorney work done, and we finally got it to the 
attorneys at the State Board of Education, and all of a 
sudden they said, okay, we will let you opt out.  So about 
four families immediately opted out of that program.

<p>

So there is a very aggressive thought process, 
very intentional process going on in the Illinois education 
system to push this, test this parental rights situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think sometimes parental rights is 
easier to understand historically.  In Pennsylvania, where I 
am originally from, Amish people worked very hard to have a 
separate school system.  I think we are all aware that 
Christian Scientists often have worked very hard to make 
different medical choices.  But for the rest of us, the 
lines are not always clear.

<p>

Steve, we are going to come back and talk more 
about the state initiatives, but do you see this as going 
away any time soon?  I mean, are we going to resolve it in 
the near future?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  I think this is going to be a battle 
for some time to come as some people try to redefine the 
rights and responsibilities of parents for them and as 
parents fight to maintain the traditional understanding of 
their rights and responsibilities, and like many issues that 
we deal with, there are people who ideologically will push 
this and push this and push this, and as parents who believe 
in our traditional role, it is going to be an ongoing battle 
until the hearts and minds of our country come around to 
understand the time-tested and age-proven responsibilities 
of parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we come back, we are going to 
talk more about what our parents' rights and 
responsibilities are.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  But I will tell you that I believe 
that the long-term effect of what is taking place in our 
country -- I would describe it as opposed to being a tragic 
incident that causes Congress to act in a knee-jerk fashion, 
that in fact this is more of a slow erosion of parents'
authority and their ability to direct the upbringing of 
their children that has taken place over the last 10, 20 
years, and it has become increasingly more common across the 
country, where we are now seeing cases from literally every 
state in the country where a parent's ability to raise their 
children continues to be undermined time and time again.  So 
that is why I think that we have had more difficulty in 
getting Congress to move on the Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act, although I will tell you that we have a 
good deal of momentum, and it is due largely to the 
tremendous support that we have gotten from the grassroots, 
from parents, from moms and dads all across the country that 
have been affected and are very concerned, in fact, worried, 
in fact I would even go so far as to say scared as to losing 
their ability to raise their own children and make decisions 
in directing their children's upbringing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I am joined by leaders at the 
state level who have been working on the Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act and some state-based parents' rights 
issues.

<p>

Paul, before the break, we were talking about what 
are our rights and responsibilities, and you had some 
legislation in your state where that is being defined for 
us.  What is happening on that?

<p>

MR. SIENNA:  Well, actually it is the Missouri 
state Goals 2000 plan, and I think the primary issue here is 
whose children are these?  The plan itself explicitly states 
that the community takes ownership of and responsibility for 
our children, and it further goes on to state that the 
teachers know best about the health and well-being of the 
children.  In fact, this academic plan contains more 
information about the health and human services of the child 
than what it does about the academic performance and 
assessment.  So this is one of the fundamental things we 
have to ask ourselves and our government:  whose children 
are they?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the government seems to have an 
answer.  You know, Steve, you wrote recently on an incident 
in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania, actually a town I have 
been to many times, and it is hard to believe in a small 
community like that of several thousand this could happen, 
but what happened there in terms of the state determining 
what is best for children's health?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN: Well, several years ago in a couple 
of different instances, the state mandated that there would 
be a medical test of children within the school systems at 
the first grade, sixth grade, and eleventh grade, and in 
this particular incident, several sixth grade girls were 
taken for their medical exam to be performed by a doctor 
that the school district brought in, and what happened was 
that the doctor decided that she needed to do not only just 
the overall exam but also genital exams on the girls.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they were how old?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  This was sixth grade.  So they were 
12-year-old girls.  When the girls said no, they did not 
want to go through with that, they were still forced to.  
One tried to get out through a window.  One tried to call 
her parents.  They would not let her call her parents.  This 
was something that had not been told to the parents ahead of 
time.  I mean, the parents knew of the medical exam, but it 
was, again, one of those opt-out scenarios.

<p>

So if the note gets lost or if somehow the parent 
does not come back with the opt-out, the kids are 
automatically included.  There was no mention of a genital 
exam being performed.  In fact, the school district admitted 
afterwards that they did not know one was going to be 
performed, but they have come out now and said that they 
were within their right to perform it and so on and so 
forth.

<p>

But the bottom line is that you have 12-year-old 
girls who are being subjected to something that the parents 
had no clue was going to happen of an incredibly intimate 
nature.  Several of the girls have talked about nightmares 
since then, and different things that are going on, because 
they felt violated.  The fact that the school district has 
come out in support of the doctor, has not admitted a 
mistake, because their lawyers think they are going to be 
taken to court, you know, all those things.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  And here is the whole thing.  Who best 
cares for the well-being of these children?  Who has those 
children's best interest at heart?  You take 12-year-old 
girls who have been traumatized, literally, for the rest of 
the lives, that the schoolteachers and the doctor are going 
to go off on their merry way after these children are gone, 
but the parents are going to have to deal with and help in 
not only the healing process but the adjustment process for 
these girls for the rest of their lives on this, and this is 
something that not only did not the school not have any 
right by any rational reasoning concept to have been 
involved in this way with the children, but then for the 
legal community to side against the parents, the parents are 
left standing all by themselves.  It really does beg to the 
heart of the question of who cares the most for those 
children? Who has those children's long-term best interests 
at heart?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  John, what are you seeing?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, that is a major example, the 
East Strasbourg situation, but I think daily there are 
examples of the more common variety.  Just at the end of 
this last school year, I had a parent call me and say that 
she was upset because her daughter, her fourth grade 
daughter, was going to be going to a science fair in the 
middle part of the state, several hundred miles, staying 
overnight in a hotel, unsupervised, and she did not feel 
comfortable with that.  Understandably, she wanted to go 
along.  She wanted to take her daughter.

<p>

The school district said no.  If the daughter is 
going to go, she has to go on the bus with the other 
students; you cannot go.  There were a number of parents 
that were very upset about that, and they had to go through 
a process of several meetings, letters.  Eventually they did 
get that right back, but again, you just have to ask the 
question:  whose kids are these?

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Let me hasten to add that it varies 
very much by school district and by even school building, 
and to say that all schools are doing this is erroneous.  In 
fact, there are many teachers and some administrators that 
are very concerned about this thing that is taking place.  
So what it comes back to is each parent, each family, has to 
monitor what is going on at their school with their teachers 
and their children, because you cannot know for sure unless 
you have done the homework that you need to do as a parent.

<p>

MR. DEALY:  Which is a really good point, John, 
that yes, these are the extreme examples that we can cite 
here, but in light of that, the legal groundwork has been 
laid that this could happen anywhere, and they would be 
protected.  That is why we go back to why this legislation 
is necessary.  It is to reassert and establish once and for 
all that it is parents who have the ultimate rights and 
authority and responsibility for the rearing of their 
children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think that might be the consensus 
around this table, but I am reminded of a case out of 
Washington State where parents -- a child, an 8-year-old boy 
who was shy was given counseling by the school without 
parental knowledge or consent.  When the boy started acting 
strangely and they took him to their own counselor and were 
told this boy has obviously been treated, what happened to 
him, they tried to get those medical records and lost a 
court case, to see the records for their own son, from the 
counseling that they did not choose and still have no first-hand 
knowledge of.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  I think the issue here, too, gets 
back to we are hearing so much the mantra of the day is it 
takes a village, and it is okay if the village has the same 
values, but unfortunately the village that many times is 
spoken of is contrary to the values that we hold dearly as 
parents.  We are seeing situations in Missouri where kids 
who are struggling with same-sex identity issues are sent to 
a counselor who happens to be a homosexual, and that is like 
sending a drunk to another drunk for counseling.  I mean, it 
just does not seem to work out that way.

<p>

One of the things that just still concerns me 
greatly, as I have three children, in order for them to take 
an aspirin at school, I have to send a permission slip.  But 
in some of the same schools, kids can go off-campus, receive 
abortion counseling and abortions without the parental 
consent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And let's remember, this is a 
surgery.  You know, abortion is a surgery.  They will not 
give you an aspirin, but they will take your child 
anonymously for surgery without telling anyone.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  Right.  Life-threatening in many cases.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Exactly.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  And then at the same time, we will go 
back to it, you cannot get your ears pierced as a minor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is right.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  Without parental written consent, but 
not only can you be -- some of these schools will arrange 
for abortions for these young girls, but then they will also 
arrange for -- in California -- for the state welfare agency 
to pick up the cost and arrange for those medical records to 
be sealed so that the parents, even if the parents found out 
and wanted to get the medical records again, they would be 
sealed from the parents to be able to have that information.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to talk more 
about what parents are facing and struggling with across 
America.  Please stay with us for more <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Videotape segment of Paul Tucker's staff briefing follows.]

<p>

MR. TUCKER:  We sent our child to school one day, 
with all the expectations that she is going to be going to 
school and there will be no problem, and she was informed 
that she had to go down for a physical examination.  She 
thought, no problem, because my daughter does go to camp 
every summer.  We do have physicals every summer for our 
children, and we do have the paperwork filled out, and we 
hand that in.

<p>

My daughter decided to leave class early to go 
down to the office to explain to these nurses that she had 
the paperwork filled out, that she really did not need a 
physical.  When she informed the nurses that she had done 
so, the nurse said "we have lost your paperwork; you have to 
have the physical."

<p>

My daughter said "but I already had one." They 
said, "well, it is too bad.  You have to have one anyway."
She said, "well, let me call my mother." They said no. "It 
does not matter what your parents think, you are going to 
have this physical anyway.  It would not matter what your 
mom said." Susie said, "I do not want a physical.  I don't
want that." They had heard some rumors that there was a 
genital part of this exam, and my daughter did not want to 
have this happen to her.

<p>

They said, "it's too bad, you have to have the 
exam," and my daughter, being a real nice girl -- I mean, 
just think of your daughter.  You teach them to respect 
teachers.  You teach them to respect elders, and there are 
certain things that have to be done in life that are not 
pleasant and stuff, but this really was not one of them that 
had to be done, especially at school, and Susie knew that 
she was not of age -- she is only 11 years old -- was not of 
age to have this type of genital exam.  The girls that were 
coming out prior to this were crying and real upset.

<p>

My daughter obeyed, under the pressures of the 
school, under the pressures of people she is supposed to 
respect, and went along with this exam.

<p>

The girls were asked in a room to strip down into 
their panties and their bras and stand there with no 
covering on whatsoever, and a lot of the girls were really 
upset at this point.  They were escorted into a room one at 
a time where the female nurse and a female pediatrician was 
to examine them.  This pediatrician, we have no idea, I have 
never met her, I have never heard of her, and I do not know 
who gave the right to do this type of examination on my 
daughter.  I certainly did not.

<p>

I turned my child over to the school.  The nurses 
were in charge of my daughter at this time.  The nurses 
should have taken responsibility and stopped at that.  My 
daughter went through a gynecological exam really against 
her will, against my will, my wife's will, without our 
knowledge whatsoever, and without our written consent.  We 
had no idea this was going to happen.

<p>

We sent our child to school one day to go to 
school.  My child comes home with this story that is 
unbelievable.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. I am joined by some real 
experts in parents' rights and state-based issues, some 
grassroots leaders from across America.

<p>

Before we went to the break, we were talking about 
the things that we have seen that often abuse parents'
rights, but you know, on the other side, people would say, 
look, what we are concerned about is that there are children 
being abused, that there are children who are being 
molested, and that parents, if they are not correctly 
monitored, may be actually injuring kids.  You know, who is 
against the Parents' Rights and Responsibilities Act?

<p>

MR. CLARK: As we worked on this Parental Rights 
Amendment to the Illinois State Constitution, one afternoon 
we counted ten lobbyists working the other side of the 
issue, and at least six of them, we believe, were in the 
employ of the National Education Association or the Illinois 
Education Association.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And their interests are a little 
different than children being molested.  They are a bit more 
personal.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  They were.  They were.  In fact, 
several school administrators have come to me privately, 
Christian men all, saying that, you know, we have a concern 
about this, because it will create havoc in our schools, 
which, in fact, it will not, and we come back to that.  But 
the other groups that are leading the opposition, the 
American Civil Liberties Union and a group in Illinois 
called Voices of Illinois Children, which was funded by some 
very liberal foundations, the concern that they voice is 
that this will be the parental abuse amendment, and they say 
that this is another way for protection of parents who 
discipline, spank, or abuse physically and mentally their 
children.  Now the fact of the matter is, abuse and neglect 
are defined through some 20-some-odd pages in the Illinois 
code already, and those laws are not impacted at all, and 
once you start taking people, legislators in particular, 
through that thought process, most of them are attorneys, 
and they understand very quickly that that is absurd.  That 
is not going to take place.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That there already are laws to deal 
with the injury of children, but there is no law to deal 
with parents.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do we think that parents are really 
going to abuse their children under cover of this bill?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  No, I do not believe so.  I think 
that, as Joe states, the laws are already written clearly.  
Where the laws are already written, we are safe.  This is 
not going to override protections in those areas that 
already exist.  What it will do is make sure that we are not 
only putting the responsibilities on parents, but we are 
giving them the proper control.

<p>

In South Dakota, we recently passed what we call 
the Grandparents' Bill for minors who have children, 
basically the parents who are the grandparents of the 
youngster that is coming along, they have the responsibility 
to provide.  It is a step in that direction.  But if we are 
putting that responsibility upon them, which I think is 
rightfully so, taking them out of the welfare system, giving 
the parents the responsibility, we ought to also be 
reaffirming their rights to raise and direct the upbringing 
of their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  The point that I was going to make is 
that the unfortunate reality in the world that we live today 
is there are some parents who have abdicated the proper 
responsibility of raising healthy children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So will this bill keep them from doing that?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  This bill will not keep them from 
doing that, but this bill will -- but that is a legal and 
criminal issue, and this bill in no way affects the criminal 
justice system from going after the appropriate measures 
towards those parents.  What it does is protect the rights 
of the vast majority of the rest of us parents who do have 
the primary goal of raising happy, healthy well-adjusted 
self-reliant children from being intruded upon by that same 
social services or criminal justice system in a wrongful way.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  As a matter fact, the other thing, 
too, in following up what Joe was saying, the opposition to 
a bill such as this, the recent Stand for Children rally 
here in Washington, D.C., if you look at the list of the 
organizations that participated in that rally, it was 
anything but a place for children.  Most of the groups that 
are opposed to this are opposed to the values that made 
America great.  Yes, we need to reaffirm the values of 
parents, and to follow up what Linda said, in other words, 
with responsibility comes accountability.  We at this table 
realize that there is a greater place of accountability than 
our government, but by the same token, we do not want to 
erase the necessary laws that are there that if you have 
abusive parents, to make sure that that is dealt with within 
our society.  That has always been dealt with.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It almost seems like it is more, in 
many ways, drawing a line in the sand between the social 
worker mentality in which parents are guilty until proven 
innocent, you know, that we are assuming parents are abusive 
and are molesting and are injuring, and if we do not get in 
there to help, we are going to have problems with that.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, we had a situation in North 
Carolina where there is a particular program that I will not 
name, but basically the social workers could come into the 
home under basically the -- what they were trying to do was 
to teach parents how to parent, but while they were there, 
they had a checklist, and they would look, and they would 
observe, and there was this long list of things that was 
totally judgmental and subjective, and based on these 
checklists, they then would have the authority to go back in 
and presumably intervene in these situations.  But we have 
seen that, and we see this cropping up in North Carolina in 
little small different ways.

<p>

We have a bill, for example, this past session 
which did not pass but would take away from parents the 
right to control who had access to their children, and it 
was entitled the Grandparents' Rights Act, but it basically 
would give presumption to grandparents to be able to sue 
parents to be able to get visitation rights to children, and 
the whole thing was based on a very few isolated cases 
around the states where unfortunately we had some parents 
that maybe should have given some more rights to the 
grandparents or had better access, but there was one couple 
who said, well, what we are after is the right to have those 
children for 3 weeks unattended in the summer and every 
other weekend by ourselves.  So this was sort of an unusual 
and strange situation that led to some legislation, but you 
just never know where it is going to crop up.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There is a lot of legislation coming 
out.  Steve, we have to go quickly to the break, but do you 
think if there was -- so many of our examples are school-related. 
Would school choice help wipe out some of this 
need, or is that only a small drop in the bucket here?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Well, school choice is a vital 
component in my belief, because it says to the parents, we 
are giving you back an opportunity to be the guardian and 
control the upbringing of your child.  It puts 
responsibility back in the parents' courts. So it gives 
them the ball to play with.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  It acknowledges that parents know best 
for their individual children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In particular, for their own school choices.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  They know the best environment in 
which that child is going to learn and flourish, because 
parents know intimately their children as individuals, 
rather than as just names on a roll or numbers in somebody's
book.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The government has their Social 
Security Number, and they are here to help you.

<p>

When we come back, we are going to talk more about 
parents' rights and responsibilities.

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  Most of the opposition to the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act comes from the 
education bureaucracy.  Just a little interesting fact for 
you to know as to how I view or why I think the opposition 
is there from the education bureaucracy, and that manifests 
itself either through the NEA or the PTA, librarians, those 
are the folks that I guess have been in our office most 
often, is that in 1930 in this country there were 130,000 
individual school boards, school boards that were manned by 
moms and dads making decisions on the local level as to what 
their children were to be taught and how they were to be 
taught it in their schools.

<p>

In 1993, there are now not 130,000 school boards; 
there are 15,000 school boards.  So what has happened is in 
this turf battle for determining who raises our children, 
the education bureaucracy has clearly gained a lot of 
ground.  When you replace 130,000 school boards of moms and 
dads making decisions on the local level and reduce it down 
to 15,000 school boards, the education bureaucracy fills the 
vacuum very, very quickly.

<p>

So when you introduce a bill in Congress like the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, whose purpose it 
is to strengthen the ability of families, those moms and 
dads, to make decisions for their children, then you are 
going to get resistance from the people that had filled the 
vacuum, which in this case is the education bureaucracy.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, and we are talking about 
parents' rights and responsibilities, whether or not the 
government recognizes them, respects them.  What kind of 
authority do parents really have?

<p>

I am sitting here with some very leading 
individuals at the state level who have worked on this both 
at their legislative level and now are interested in what is 
happening at the federal level.

<p>

We were talking a little bit earlier about the 
Rights and Responsibilities Act, and you brought up a very 
interesting concern that the people of Illinois have.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Well, one of the first questions is 
why do we need this kind of legislation at all, and the 
point we try to make is that we are trying to reclaim some 
lost ground.  There are a couple of Supreme Court decisions 
from back in the 1920s, 1923 and 1925, that really lay out 
this concept very clearly, but state courts and some federal 
courts have ignored those as they have made decisions.

<p>

So the idea is to put this amendment at the state 
level forward to start a debate, number one, and get people 
to rethink the role of parents versus the state in who 
should be raising the kids, and then secondly, to give 
parents a whole new standing legally by amending a state 
level constitution.  Nothing happens immediately if an 
amendment is approved.  What has to happen then, as each 
school district and as each court case comes up, the judge 
or the school administrators have to rethink, now, what are 
we doing that might be in conflict with that?

<p>

I like to make the analogy of the Freedom of 
Speech in the Bill of Rights, because nobody tells you what 
that means on a day-to-day basis, yet intuitively over the 
decades we have evolved a body of law that says what that 
is, and by putting this amendment in the state constitution, 
we can see that we will get more consistent decisions out of 
state and federal courts.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  That reclaiming of lost ground that 
Joe talks about, it is kind of like human nature is like 
water.  We pick the course of least resistance.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And what is happening here is that the government 
comes in and says let us take over.  Let us do more of this.  
We will pick where your kids are educated.  We will pick how 
to teach them sex ed.  I mean, how many parents really 
relish the idea of talking about sex with their teenage 
kids, you know, raise your hand, uh uh.  I mean, it is 
something you do not look forward to, and so the state says, 
hey, we will do that for you, and a lot of parents go, whew, 
man, right on, I'm out of here.  So what we have to do is 
come back and reaffirm the responsibilities that parents 
have, the rights that come along with those, and begin to 
reeducate parents as to their proper role, because what we 
are doing right now is we are taking that path of least 
resistance, and as long as the government continues to offer 
us more services to raise our kids, unfortunately a lot of 
parents are choosing --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To allow them to do it.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  It is too easy.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  It goes back to this whole notion 
that people are afraid that this Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act is going to redefine what it means to be 
a parent, and in fact, it is not going to redefine what it 
means to be a parent, because that definition has never 
really changed.  Our culture has tried to change the 
definition, but we need to go back to the original 
definition of what it is to be a parent, and that is to take 
the responsibility for our own children.

<p>

I grew up in a small town where everyone knew 
everyone, and if I was in trouble, before I got home my 
mother knew that I was in trouble, because everyone knew who 
Beverly and Charlie's kids were.  As a matter of fact, I 
accused my mother of working for the CIA, and as I got 
older, I found out that she did not work for the CIA; in 
fact, they worked for her.  She was the boss.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But we need to get back to that original 
definition and the responsibilities associated with being a 
parent, and I think that is what this act tries to do is to 
bring that back.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Paul touched on something, I think, 
that is crucial to the debate, and that is the sense of 
community.  The key thing that he said was that when he was 
in trouble and someone saw him, who did they call?  They did 
not call social services.  They called his parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  They went to the authority, and they 
called the parents, and they said here is what is going on.  
I think we need to refoster that.  We have lost the sense of 
aunts and uncles, because we move a lot.  Someone said the 
other day garage door openers were the worst thing that 
could happen to a community, because we open the door as we 
are driving in and we close it before we get out of our car.  
We no longer wave to the people that live to one side -- we 
do not even know the people that live to one side or the 
other of us.  So we need to get back to understanding that 
sense of community, to understand that the parent has the 
authority over the kids, and that we do not call social 
services, we call the parent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we come back, we are going to 
hear more about the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act 
and from the state leaders who are helping make it happen.
Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking about 
parental rights and responsibilities and are we having some 
of both or neither.  Frankly, this particular issue is part 
and parcel of a lot of momentum.

<p>

What are you seeing on that?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, yes, I think what we have been 
talking about here really reminds us that this bill, this 
whole parental rights movement, goes to the heart of the 
conservative movement as a whole.  That is, less government, 
more individual responsibility.  When I come back to 
Washington from South Dakota, walk around and see the 
buildings, row upon row of government buildings, I am just 
reminded of all of the work that politicians have done to 
try to solve our problems, and they have just created more.  
We need to turn more authority back to the local level, and 
the most local level of all is parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Why do you think that is, though, 
because clearly the government says the family is 
dysfunctional -- you know, that is such a yuppie word -- and 
the government needs to step in.  Why do you think some of 
this has kind of created problems?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, I believe it actually has been 
kind of a self-perpetuating cycle.  The government sees a 
problem and maybe has a legitimate concern about it, perhaps 
oversteps their boundaries a bit, and you know, the welfare 
examples would be classic in that sense that problems are 
addressed, perhaps even with good intentions, and yet the 
result is people turn to government even more, rely on 
government even more.  We need to at least make that 
reminder, put that reminder out there, that individual 
responsibility, parental responsibility, is ultimate.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  You just said a key phrase:
individual responsibility.  I look at my generation and what 
was going on in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s and how many 
people made individual choices to do what is right for me as 
a person and not for the larger community or for the family, 
and one of the best responses I have heard to that "It Takes 
a Whole Village" was coined by my predecessor in this job, 
Penny Poulin[?] back in Illinois who said it takes a whole 
family, and when you understand that and you take on the 
responsibility as an individual for your role in that 
family, then a lot of these problems go away.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA: But you know, Steve brought up a 
good point earlier about the whole idea of taking the path 
of least resistance, but many times our government has 
created this situation that causes the parents to take that 
path of least resistance.  I know Linda talked about the 
necessity in many homes where it is no longer a choice for 
there to be two parents working, and so you begin to see now 
that --

<p>

MS. DEALY:  If we were not taxed at the level we 
are, there would not be a need for many mothers to be -- 

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  So the need for daycare early and 
often comes up, and the whole idea now you find parents who 
are looking for not only that before care and after care, 
but they are also becoming proponents of year-round 
schooling, because, hey, that is a lot more convenient.  The 
thing that concerns me most about that -- we have heard the 
examples given here -- is that the school has been the 
vehicle by which parental rights have been taken away the 
most.  So we need to really -- and someone talked about it 
earlier, the individual responsibility and accountability 
that comes with us as parents to be informed.

<p>

Joe, you touched on that, for people to go back 
and to know what has gone on in their local school district.  
The best way to change this is not Washington, D.C. down, 
even though this is important.  But the best way to change 
it is for people to go to their local school district where 
they know the school board members' names, the 
superintendent's name, the principal's name.  I mean, they 
live in that same community with those folks and address it 
there.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, one of the things that I 
think we forget when we are looking at public policy, and I 
am an economist, so I tend to focus in this direction more 
than maybe some others, is the old adage, follow the money.  
One of the things that we have touched on is that these 
institutions have been built by government and by 
politicians over the last 30 or 40 years, and they are 
large, and they are powerful, and they get billions of 
dollars a year, a lot of which they use back to lobby to 
keep those funds.  So as powerful organizations, they have a 
vested self-interest to protect, and we see a lot of these 
proposals coming from these organizations, and as you 
pointed out, I believe you said you had 10 people opposing 
you from the education establishment on your parental rights 
bill in Illinois.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  That is the lobbyists, yes.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Now that is an example of the power 
that they can wield.  So we have to look at that, follow the 
money.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  At taxpayer expense, the power that 
they wield against us, with our money.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Right, at taxpayer expense.  And we 
have to point that out, and we have to show that what we are 
dealing with is people who are not acting necessarily in our 
best interests or in the best interests of our children, but 
in their best interests, because they are trying to protect 
their jobs, protect their institutions that have been built 
up over the years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right.  See, it is interesting when 
you look at it.  The average private school education costs 
about $2,000, $1,500 to $2,000, while the average public 
school education is like $5,000 to $6,000, and as a matter 
of fact, in the District of Columbia where we have metal 
detectors protecting us from ourselves, the average 
education here is around $9,000 per child.  Yet, if you look 
at the numbers at Catholic schools or private schools or 
even the homeschoolers in terms of SAT scores, blowing it 
out of the water.  Why then -- you know, and I ask this of 
you -- why then are we not more in favor of things like 
educational choice, which give power to the parents when we 
see the impact?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  Well, each of us are.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We here are.  So the question you are asking is 
why is the education establishment not more in favor?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But why is society not in favor of 
giving parents authority?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  That just highlights the reality of 
what their interest is.  Their interest is not the quality 
education of the child or the student.  Their interest is in 
the whole larger picture, which is either self-perpetuation, 
protecting their own jobs and advancement, or they have a 
larger sociological agenda, to have an impact on the -- and 
they are all in there together, and I always have to be 
careful when I talk about that, because I do not want to 
discount -- when I am making complaints against education, I 
am talking about the educational bureaucracy and the 
leadership of the teachers' unions and things like that, not 
the individual teachers who too often are so oppressed by 
their own establishment that they are in there being -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, they are the ones that are 
forced to do these things.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  They can be well-intentioned and have 
the best interests of the child but be held in a 
stranglehold to be able to be effective as they would like 
to be as teachers.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  It is not quality.  It is the 
control.  As a matter of fact, the whole issue of school 
choice, there have been situations where minorities, once 
they have been informed properly what school choice means, 
an overwhelming majority of minorities are in favor of 
school choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Oh, they are more in favor than the 
average population.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  We have a case in Los Angeles.  There 
is a private school that was started by a family in south 
central Los Angeles that there is a waiting list literally 
hundreds of children long to get into this school, because 
they can see the delineation between the education that 
these children are receiving there, and this is a school 
absolutely run on a shoestring, yet the parents are involved 
in the school; the people who are running it are so 
dedicated to making an impact and a positive difference in 
these students' lives, they are tripping over children who 
want to get into this school.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, I think it is clear that this 
is a conversation we are going to need to continue, and I 
would like to thank all my guests for being with us.  When 
we come back, we will have more from <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  If you want to be for children, then 
you need to be for parents, because nobody is for children 
more than their parents are, and that is why we have 
introduced the Parental Rights and Responsibility Act.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us at <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you would like to 
receive more information about the Family Research Council, 
tonight's guests, or the crucial issues affecting you and 
your family, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week, we will alert parents to a new affront
against America's children as we discuss a recent court case 
which opened the world of pornography to our children over 
the Internet.  Are we losing the battle to protect our 
children from pornography in cyberspace?  We will find out 
when we bring you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are discussing one of the latest
in technological advancements, the Internet.  You have
probably heard about your home computer as a link to all the
information in the world's databases, but we will be taking
a look at how cyberspace allows pornography to enter your
home and reach your children through just a few strikes on
the keyboard.

<p>

Pro-family groups found some solace in the 
Communications Decency Act which made it more difficult for 
children to come across indecent material in cyberspace.
Yet, just a few weeks ago, a Pennsylvania federal court
blocked enforcement of that law, saying that it limits First 
Amendment protection of the Net.

<p>

Tonight, we will be talking to those who work 
closely with this case and continue to do battle for your 
children.

<p>

But first, let's get the inside scoop on Capitol 
Hill.  Marty Dannenfelser runs the Family Research Council's
Government Relations shop after years on the Hill.  He works 
daily with congressmen and senators, staying up to the 
minute on the issues affecting your family.  We will hear 
about the key issues that the House and the Senate are 
attempting to highlight and to avoid as we near the election 
and as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You have worked on 
the Hill for a lot of years and had a chance to see a lot of 
Congress sessions come to a close, and in particular to see 
the session transition into an election, most particularly a 
Presidential election.

<p>

What does that mean about the importance of the 
issues at play now, given that the session is ending, but we 
are going into a Presidential election?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it makes the whole 
dynamic very politically charged, and there is a lot of 
activity that takes place that seems to advance the agenda 
of either candidate by the members of the party of that 
candidate, and it is producing quite a conflict from issues 
like health care and welfare and the whole spending process, 
the appropriations process.  All of this, I think, really is 
being worked out against the backdrop of the impending 
Presidential election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In a Presidential election cycle, it 
seems that some of the issues are brought up more 
philosophically, just to argue about the issues that either 
candidate cares about, rather than really substantively.
Are these issues at play really significant?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  There is some of that. You 
certainly see that in this whole debate about whether or not 
we are going to have medical savings accounts in the health 
care bill and whether or not we are going to link welfare 
reform and Medicaid reform and so on.  So much of that is 
tied to the arguments that the various candidates have made.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What issues are still at play that affect families?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, one of the big issues 
that is still at play is the Defense of Marriage Act, and 
people may be aware of the situation in Hawaii where the 
Hawaiian courts are expected to mandate that the state has 
to recognize same sex marriages as legitimate marriages, and 
under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. 
Constitution, the other states, all 49 of them, may have to 
recognize those marriages.

<p>

So Congress has a bill to protect states who 
choose not to recognize those marriages and also defines 
marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman for 
federal purposes for the impact that would have on federal 
benefits and so on.  So that is a very important thing.  The 
President has said that he would sign the bill.

<p>

We now have a situation where Senator Ted Kennedy 
is trying to introduce another issue into the mix, what is 
called the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, and he has 
indicated that he will try to attach that to the Defense of 
Marriage Act, which could muddy the waters, and our hope is 
that those two issues would be kept separate and that we 
will get that bill, the Defense of Marriage Act, passed this 
year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bill Clinton, as we know, has been 
very pro-homosexual in the agenda that he has embraced, and 
yet he came forward in favor of the Defense of Marriage, as 
did Bob Dole.  It would have seemed like the right thing to 
do would have been to force the Defense of Marriage Act 
through quickly and have them put their electoral votes 
where their mouth is.  Why didn't that happen?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  It has been partly complicated 
by the legislative schedule.  There is a desire in the House 
to move the appropriation bills.  They have to pass 13 
appropriation bills, and they had hoped to get most of them 
done before this July 4 recess, and I think they have about 
seven or eight of them done.  So that has been pushed off.
So we do hope to see some movement on the bill in the month 
of July.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there a lot of sentiment in 
support of the Defense of Marriage Act?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  We sense that it is very 
strongly supported by people across the board.  There is 
some activity by the Human Rights Campaign Fund and some 
other pro-homosexual groups to try to derail it and try to 
suggest that it is political, but it is very necessary, 
because we do feel that this court decision in Hawaii could 
come down as early as September, and in the absence of this 
bill, we could see all kinds of executive action by the 
administration to start implementing this and forcing the 
states to recognize these marriages and forcing federal 
programs to pay benefits to the so-called spouses of these 
individuals.  So it is very important that this legislation 
be enacted before Congress leaves town.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Another of the issues at play has 
been the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act which was to deal 
with a very limited late term abortion procedure that we 
know from the doctor that invented has been used against 
healthy viable children 7, 8, and 9 months of gestation.
When it first went through, it went through by wide margins, 
and Bill Clinton vetoed it.  There has been talk about 
bringing it back, possibly for a veto override before the 
end of the summer.  Is this a possibility?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes, the timing is not nailed 
in concrete just now, but we do expect possibly by the end 
of the summer that that will come up, and there are efforts 
to educate the public, because there is a need to turn 
around some votes in the Senate and also to hold onto those 
votes in the House.

<p>

There were two-thirds margins in the House in the 
two votes that they have taken on this legislation, but 
there will be a lot of pressure, particularly on Democratic 
members, to defend the President and to argue that his 
position regarding this health exception, which we would 
argue would make it abortion on demand, that those type of 
issues are already accounted for in the bill to protect the 
life of the mother when her life is threatened by some 
serious health complication.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There have been some recent 
developments on the partial birth abortion ban sentiment 
come up in the military, and something very unusual has 
happened. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes, a directive went out from 
the Pentagon to the military chaplains, telling them that 
they could not participate in the distribution of postcards 
that have been prepared by the Catholic bishops, and there 
is going to be a massive distribution of these postcards at 
Catholic churches throughout the country this weekend, and 
they have been told that in the military churches that they 
cannot distribute these postcards because they suggest that 
this is political, and it is interesting that the people who 
are the top decision makers at the Pentagon are, in fact, 
political appointees.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They are appointed by the President.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They are ultimately appointed 
by the President.  So that raises some real questions.  The 
whole idea of separation of church and state is interesting 
in this discussion, too, because the ACLU and many liberal 
activists are constantly invoking this mantra about church 
and state.

<p>

What the founding fathers meant in that area was 
that the state should stay out of religion, and this seems 
to be a classic example of the state interfering in 
religious expression and in free speech expression, as well.
So we are very disturbed about this action and really feel 
that it has the appearance of being politically motivated 
when, in fact, the postcard campaign is really geared 
towards protecting innocent life, and churches often speak 
out on public policy issues, and to try to gag them in this 
particular case is really a very troubling action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At the grassroots level, there is a 
lot of support for the Defense of Marriage Act and the 
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, and another issue that has 
brought a lot of attention by average Americans has been the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.  What is the 
status on that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, that has had hearings in 
both the House and Senate and has a good number -- I think 
over 160 co-sponsors in the House.  There is quite a 
coalition amassed against it, largely teachers unions, child 
welfare advocates, and the like.  We believe that they see 
this as really threatening their agenda and their control 
over the agenda, and they argue that this is somehow going 
to protect parents who would abuse their children when, in 
fact, the legislation has specific language in it to make 
clear that it does not provide any protection for child 
abusers.

<p>

The education lobby, the National Education 
Association and some of the other school boards and parent 
teacher groups, are arguing that this could somehow disrupt 
the day-to-day activities in the classroom, but we feel that 
is a red herring, that the National Education Association 
and others have had a history of usurping parents rights, 
and they want to continue business as usual.

<p>

So this is the type of issue where there is a good 
deal of public support, very strong support, for the 
principle that parents' rights should take precedence over 
the state.  Now certainly there are instances where parents 
neglect their responsibilities, and then someone has to step 
in on behalf of the children, but in those cases where 
parents are exercising their responsibility, the state 
should not be interfering with the day-to-day guidance that 
parents are trying to give their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In an election year, one of the 
topics that every politician wants to discuss is tax relief, 
and of course, they are always for that.  Yet, despite a lot 
of support, the $500 per child tax credit has not happened.  
Is that going to come up again before the election?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  It may come up in some form.
Of course, it has already passed the Congress and has been 
vetoed by the President.  There has been some discussion of 
linking it with welfare and Medicaid reform, although that 
is starting to look less likely.  They might just do welfare 
by itself or Medicaid by itself.

<p>

Our concern is if they do not put it in a package 
that they are not going to have the savings in terms of how 
they calculate the budget numbers to get the $500 per child 
tax credit done, but there is still talk about them perhaps 
doing it as a freestanding bill, but the President has this 
situation where he does not like the Medicaid reform, and he 
would argue, I think, that if they do not get both of them 
done, well, we do not have the savings.  So I think it is 
something of a Catch-22 situation that is in front of us on 
that unfortunately.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  In all the issues that the grassroots has really been 
tracking, how would you order them for their importance in this cycle?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I think the partial birth 
abortion issue really shows people how far we have come in 
the extreme abortion policy in this country.  I think many 
people have had the impression -- and some of the polls bear 
this out -- that abortion is only legal in the early stages 
of pregnancy for hard case situations, when in fact it is 
allowed virtually at any time for any reason, and to see a 
child going through the birth process, to be four-fifths of 
the way born and then stabbed in the back of the head and 
killed, that shocks people.

<p>

They had no idea that that was going on in this 
country and that that is the nature of the abortion license 
in this country that it has become that extreme.  So I think 
it is very important for people to realize how far this has 
gone, and I think that will shake them up and start to focus 
on what are we going to do about this type of policy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Glad to be here.  Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> begins our discussion of cyberporn.  How can 
we battle the lucrative pornography industry?  Stay tuned to 
hear how our guests answer that crucial question.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  In February, the Telecommunications 
Act of 1996 was signed into law by President Clinton.  Part 
of that act included the Communications Decency Act, which 
is simply a law that says adults have no right to knowingly 
give pornography to children over computer systems.  Well, 
the ACLU and other groups immediately filed a lawsuit saying 
that this is going to ruin our cherished freedom of free 
speech, and we have this drama played out in a federal court 
in Philadelphia.

<p>

The Supreme Court has said that we do not have to 
have that, that pornography is not a measure of our freedom.  
Rather, it is a sort of low-level type of speech that we 
need to tolerate at some levels, but certainly we do not 
need to have our children tolerate it.  Every time a new 
technology develops, first of all, pornographers rush in and 
exploit that technology, sometimes drive it, and then, 
secondly, the porn defenders come in and say, well, 
pornography law cannot apply in this technology certainly.  
Videos are different than magazines, and certainly 
pornography laws should not apply to videos.  That is what 
we heard in the early 1980s.

<p>

Well, that argument failed, and we have seen that 
with television, telephone, cable, and now we are seeing it 
with the computer and with the Internet.  So I believe that 
the challenges that are going on across the country are just 
the same challenges we have always seen and that our side 
will be successful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Although success seems thwarted due 
to some Pennsylvania judges, our guests tonight continue 
their fight.  I would like to introduce Colby May, who is 
senior counsel in the Office of Governmental Affairs for the 
American Center for Law and Justice.  I would also like to 
welcome Bruce Taylor, who is president and chief counsel of 
the National Law Center for Children and Families.  Also 
with us is Cathy Cleaver, who is Director of Legal Studies 
for the Family Research Council and a frequent guest.
Welcome to all of you.

<p>

Let me start with a question that we asked right 
at the bump.  What can people do to protect their children 
from pornography on the Internet, given some of the recent 
court rulings?  Is there any help from government, or is it 
going to be kind of a go fish world where you have to get 
your own kind of technology?

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, at this point in time, it is kind 
of a go fish world.  I think this court relied very much on 
the idea that there were computer programs, software 
programs, available to protect or empower parents, and based 
upon that, they believe that that is the appropriate remedy, 
at least at this level.  Now, of course, I think you will 
find everybody here today probably disagrees with that and 
believes that certainly this ought to be appealed and is 
being appealed and ought to be reversed, but right now it is 
parents go out, get familiar with what programs are 
available, Surf Watch, et cetera, to protect your children, 
because right now the government is not going to step in and 
do that.

<p>

One of the things that they said in the case was 
that if industry had to help protect children from 
pornography that it would be a terrible barrier to overcome 
and an impossible barrier to overcome, and Cathy, you were 
writing about that recently.  Is this a barrier, a 
technological barrier, that the industry could not achieve, 
protecting children from pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Not at all.  We know that there is 
simply a lack of will on the part of the industry, not a 
lack of ability, in coming up with ways to screen people, to 
decide whether they are an adult or a child, before you let 
them into a pornographic site.  We think that that will 
become increasingly clear as time passes that there are ways 
to protect consumers in cyberspace, there are new ways to 
protect amateur musicians who want to share their songs but 
not have their copyrights violated.  There ought to be a way 
with all this technology to put barriers up to protect 
children, and we believe there is a way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What kind of things would happen?  I 
have heard things like photocopy your driver's license and 
mail it in for some kind of password so that you could prove 
your age.  What kind of barriers could be put up?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Well, the CDA, the law passed by 
Congress, anticipated that the industry could come up with a 
lot of different ways, that even users could come up with 
ways to protect themselves.  The law specifically allows for 
taking credit cards or adult PIN numbers.  But beyond that, 
there are a lot of new technologies being developed like 
digital IDs and smart cards.

<p>

There are protocols being written for the next 
generation of the Internet operating system that could 
include a code that says you are an adult, or I am an A and 
my kid is a C.  So anytime anyone showed up electronically 
at a Web page or at an Internet site, they would 
automatically be known to that site as an adult or a child, 
and pictures that are inappropriate for children could be 
blocked, and adults could get right in.

<p>

So there are a lot of ways that technically they 
could do it with just a tweaking of the program, and that is 
what the CDA gave immunity for the industry to develop, and 
the industry said we want to be good Samaritans; give us the 
immunity to help parents and help children, and Congress 
gave it to them.

<p>

Now they are challenging the law because they say 
they do not want to go through that extra -- although we 
think the industry is going to fight among themselves to 
come up with certain kinds of technological abilities to 
comply with this, so whether the industry likes it or not, 
somebody is going to develop a way to comply with the CDA, 
and when they do, they are going to get rich, and that is 
going to be the incentive to do it, whether America Online 
or Prodigy and CompuServe like it or not, and it is going to 
be easy to comply with the CDA, and then I think the courts 
will like the law.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  The important thing right now, 
though, is there is nothing in place.  Parents have to fend 
for themselves, and interestingly, shockingly, in 
Philadelphia the leading software blocking system admitted 
in court -- this is Surf Watch -- that they miss 800 
pornographic sites per month.  Those are 800 adult 
bookstores on-line that your child can get into without any 
barrier whatsoever, and that is with a protective software 
device.  So parents, we cannot overemphasize how important 
it is for parents to either decide not to let their children 
on this new great technology, which is an awfully high price 
to pay for pornography.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And as you know, Kristi, the whole 
purpose of the lawsuit by the ACLU and the American Library 
Association and some of the big companies was to not have 
any obligations that they would have to fight about free 
speech.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is a really good point, because 
they are saying it is too much money.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  It is self-interest.  It is too much 
problem.  But they did offer to the court, they said, you do 
not need to have a law, because we have all these software 
programs.  They offered the court Surf Watch, which they 
just started developing last year.  They dug it out of the 
dustbin.  It did not work when they played it for Congress.
It failed when they tried it in the court in Philadelphia.
It failed in New York.  It is the worst of the programs.
The second generations, we hope, are going to be better. As 
Colby mentioned, these software screening things and the Net 
Nannies and the Cyberpatrol and Rated PG and Library Safe 
and some of the newer generations are much more --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Much more effective.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Yes, they are going to be more 
effective, but parents are still at the mercy of somebody 
else who has found this pornography or who can block your 
kid, but that does not keep from finding it next door or at 
the school or at the library where they do not put these 
blocks on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Or at another child's home whose parent is unaware.

<p>

MR. MAY:  And what is interesting is that the 
debate, it seems to me, needs to be on the responsibilities 
that people have that want to use this new technology.  We 
as a society and as a people have no problem in putting 
certain restrictions on in terms of responsibilities when 
you use cable systems, broadcast facilities, when you use 
common carriers through your phone lines and the like, and 
the idea that that same sense of balance and responsibility 
cannot apply by virtue of there being something so unique or 
so mysterious about the cyberworld that we cannot apply 
these same kind of restrictions, I find to be utterly 
unsupportable.

<p>

Frankly, I believe the Supreme Court will 
eventually reverse that and correct what this panel has done 
in Philadelphia, because quite honestly, while we all revere 
and love the First Amendment, we all recognize that as a 
people we care about ordered liberty and we care about 
people being responsible for the freedoms that they are 
given, and right now, for the court to have sort of usurped 
its judgment for the collective judgment of Congress and the 
President on this matter, if I were uninitiated to the 
ambiguities and confusions of the law, which unfortunately I 
am not -- I wish I was more innocent of it -- I would be 
wondering what in heaven's name is this court doing and why 
is it that the people cannot have an interest in protecting 
children that goes beyond the parent being responsible to go 
out and buy the software, become educated about how to apply 
it, how to install it, how to use it, and how to then 
monitor it to make sure your child or his friends have not 
gotten around it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a tough thing.  I think for 
people who are watching, they may not understand it.  What 
we are in essence saying is that we are free to pollute our 
cultural environment, and parents have to buy the gas masks.  
You know, we are not surprised about seat belt laws.  We are 
not surprised that there are scrubbers on a coal mine.  We 
are not surprised that the FDA says, oh, by the way, this 
has a poisonous side effect.  But somehow with something 
like pornography, we say let the buyer beware, and parents 
must stand at armed gates.

<p>

There is a lot of weight been placed on parents 
and on the technology, but this is not going to touch on the 
chat room phenomenon, is it?  There are limits to even the 
best of technology, aren't there?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Absolutely, and a key thing that I 
think people should understand about this recent ruling is 
that what this court has said in Philadelphia is that we are 
not even allowed to enact a law that says adults should not 
send pornography by email directly to a specific child.
That is how radical this decision is.  The court says it is 
unconstitutional to even try to do that.  We are sure the 
Supreme Court is going to overturn that portion of this 
court's ruling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To ask you one quick question before 
we go to the break, so things that you could not send the 
child in the mail, you can email?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Correct.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  You can go to jail under any state 
law -- and state laws still apply, too.  I mean, this court 
just struck down parts of a federal statute, but state 
prosecutors can use state harmful to minors laws and state 
obscenity laws, and they should be doing that more often.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the Internet is a haven for pedophiles.

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more after this 
commercial break.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing 
pornography on the Internet, and I am joined by attorneys 
who filed briefs in the most recent cyberporn case out in 
Philadelphia:  Colby May, senior counsel in the Office of 
Governmental Affairs for the American Center for Law and 
Justice, Bruce Taylor, president and chief counsel of the 
National Law Center for Children and Families, and Cathy 
Cleaver, who is director of legal studies for the Family 
Research Council.  Welcome back.

<p>

You all have some impressive titles.  We were 
talking before about the world in which pedophiles now can 
operate on the computer system, and I think that is the 
thing that parents are most concerned about.  I mean, it is 
one thing if you are an adult and you click across something 
and you are offended and you can kill it, but as we were 
saying before, if you are a pedophile, you can email 
pornography to children that you could not mail through what 
email people call snail mail.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  That is correct, and what is equally 
disturbing is that, look, we know that pedophiles 
traditionally stalk kids in playgrounds.  Well, we know that 
computers are the child's playground of the 1990s.  That is 
where children play these days increasingly.  So it is a 
really toxic mix to have these playgrounds be a place where 
children are fair game to pedophiles.  It is very 
disturbing.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And it is hard to catch.  I mean, a 
pedophile sitting in his home in Portland, Oregon can hit on 
200 kids a day all over the country, and he can send nude 
pictures of himself or <i>Hustler</i> centerfold, and this court 
said that should be all right.  But Congress said it was a 
crime.  I think the Supreme Court is going to bring that 
crime back.  But it is a tough problem.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You were saying that as sort of a 
stalking on the Internet, and there are articles coming out 
regularly -- 

<p>

MR. MAY:  There have been articles coming out.
Fortunately portions of the law were upheld, and one of the 
portions was the use of computer networks and the like for 
stalking, and that is illegal under the Communications 
Decency Act, but what you have is the enticements and the 
ticklers that go out.

<p>

So as Bruce mentioned, I can send, as long as I do 
not engage in a dialogue with the minor child, I can send 
out material that would be enticing or otherwise interesting 
which I would then intend to be used in some pedophile ring 
or some other certainly illegal venture, and you now have 
given the pedophile or those that would use it for a very 
destructive person a great tool to do what?  To reach 
literally hundreds of children where before, without this 
electronic medium, they certainly would have no ability to 
do that, and the idea that this court believes that we 
cannot require that adults rein in their own impulses and 
own appetites to the point where when you are speaking to 
children and you know you are speaking to children, that you 
do not have indecent conversations, you do not transmit 
pornographic and indecent materials, frankly I do not think 
it is too much to ask, and I think once the American 
families and the voters understand that, they are going to 
realize -- wait just a moment.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Because it is our children we are talking about.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Absolutely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, <i>Saturday Night Live</i> had a 
skit, I do not know if you all saw -- unfortunately my 
husband and I are late night people -- of a dirty old man in 
his underwear emailing in chat rooms.  He would pretend he 
was a little girl or a little boy and would lead a 
conversation in a chat room to a sexual way, and he was 
hanging out in kids' chat rooms, and the nature of the skit 
was these children trying to respond to these dirty 
questions not really understanding, you know, how funny it
was what the kids would say back.

<p>

But would that still -- this would seem to be 
still legal, this sort of interjecting sexual themes if you 
are not intending sex to occur.  Would our children not 
still be vulnerable to these chat room conversations?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Our children now are completely 
vulnerable for any adult who wants to try his best to 
offend, to himself find some sort of sexual gratification by 
scaring or offending innocent children.  Right now, our 
hands are tied according to this Philadelphia court.  We 
must allow that to happen.  We have to stand silent.  Our 
laws have to be silent in front of this.

<p>

Recently, there was an article that talked about 
judges being our robed masters.  There is some telling truth 
to that sort of phrase.  These judges are out of touch if 
they think that is unconstitutional.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Some people look at the 
Communications Decency Act, to kind of take the other side 
for a moment, and say, look, if we start regulating speech, 
you know, today it is speech dealing with sex, tomorrow 
maybe it is speech dealing with our basic liberties, 
although it is hard to believe that Patrick Henry would have 
had a <i>Playboy</i> printing press in his basement.  But do you 
see a slippery slope here if we restrain pornography for our 
other speech freedoms?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  That is one of our favorite 
arguments.  Both of us wrote briefs.  Cathy and I wrote a 
brief for FRC, National Law Center, Enough is Enough, the 
National Coalition for Protection of Children and Families.  
Colby wrote a brief with Jim Henderson for ACLJ.  In both of 
our briefs, we laid out for the court the legal decisions of 
the Supreme Court and the FCC where they said indecency 
applies to that kind of pornography that is sexually 
explicit material -- it has to be sex acts or sex organs -- 
that is patently offensive, that is intended to offend.  It 
has no serious value.  You know, it is the kind of stuff 
that is separated from serious literature and art like you 
find in museums or libraries.  It is not AIDS information.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How is it separated?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Because of the way the courts have 
interpreted that term indecency.  They say if something is 
in Michelangelo's David or Ulysses or some classic work and 
it is not a sexually exploitive type of picture of sex or 
nudity, then it is not indecent, because indecency is not 
all sex and nudity; it is that patently inoffensive kind 
that is inappropriate for children.

<p>

So the court has already said -- and it reaffirmed 
it again last week in the cable decision -- that indecency 
does not apply to serious speech.  It is not AIDS 
information or medical textbooks.  So when the ACLU says, 
oh, this will ban the Venus de Milo, it is a ridiculous 
argument, because the courts have already taken it away.  
Now this panel of judges in Philadelphia bought all of that 
and almost as if they had never read the court decisions, 
and that is why we are more confident that the Supreme Court 
will reverse that, and even though we say, yeah, there are 
some software programs, and yes, parents can kick their kids 
off the Internet, our answer to that is Congress passed this 
law to make the Internet safe for kids and told adults if 
you want to have your own adult pornography, you can limit 
it to other adults.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You need to set it up and secure it.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And we think that we are going to 
keep fighting with more briefs in the Supreme Court and more 
activities in Congress and in the other courts until we get 
a law that is going to give kids an ability to use the 
Internet just as much as adults, and I think we will 
eventually win it.  It might take us a couple of years, but 
I think we are at least committed to fighting that until we 
get it done.

<p>

MR. MAY:  I would just add that the law here that 
we care about -- we love the First Amendment, we revere the 
First Amendment, we are engaged in a lot of First Amendment 
defense.  We certainly have done it in the pro-life context, 
representing protesters and that sort of thing for many, 
many years.

<p>

But this is a terrible problem which this court 
has just closed its eyes to and refused to realize that you 
are not talking about speech that it is protected to all 
citizens all the time, so the First Amendment implications 
are dramatically reduced.  We all the time define out what 
that is.

<p>

Here we mean -- first, let me say that there is no 
speech that is censored or struck that otherwise is, you 
know, black marker going through.  It simply says that it is 
regulated in that context, and they regulate speech all the 
time.

<p>

So here we are saying to the unique and special 
class of children which we as a people, as a society, care 
and understand need to have special needs and interests, we 
are going to require that adults -- what a surprise -- that 
adults act in responsible ways to make sure that when they 
engage in conversations or transmit material that is 
patently offensive and that the subject of which deals with 
sexual and excretory functions, and you do not direct that 
or engage in that kind of conversation with children.

<p>

That does not seem to me at any rate to be a 
particularly astounding or shocking proposition, and I think 
that is why I would respond to say it is not a slippery 
slope, because the nature of the conversations are not those 
that are automatically free willy-nilly protected to anyone 
and everyone.  Now adults can have it, but you cannot have 
it with children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Just for people to understand, there 
are places where speech is restricted.  I mean, even the 
bill of rights is a balancing of rights.  You cannot vote 
any time you want.  There is a day to vote.  You know, you 
cannot take a loaded weapon into the middle of a hospital 
just because you want to.

<p>

When we come back from the break, let's just talk 
a little bit more about the fact that speech is not the 
untouched right.  Everything is balanced out, and let's talk 
a little bit about where speech is restricted.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear more 
about protecting our children from pornography.  Join us 
after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are talking about 
pornography on the Internet.  I am joined once again by 
three attorneys who are working diligently on this issue:
Colby May, Bruce Taylor, and Cathy Cleaver.

<p>

When we went into the break, we were talking about 
the fact that basically what you are saying with laws that 
deal with pornography, there are appropriate restrictions 
and, in particular, restrictions for our children, but I 
think a lot of people think of free speech and think that 
somehow our speech is unregulated.  Is the idea of keeping 
pornography from our children some new concept, or are there 
any restrictions on speech that people would be aware of?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Well, there are many restrictions on 
speech.  We do not have an absolute right to speak.  We 
cannot rent an X-rated movie to a child.  We cannot sell a 
pornographic magazine to a child.  Those are all 
restrictions on speech.  Then, of course, there are fraud 
and slander laws and laws in favor of the public safety that 
restricts speech, such as yelling "fire" in a crowded 
theater.  We can prohibit that.

<p>

Those are all limits on our First Amendment 
rights, but those are limits we embrace.  We think they are 
reasonable, and we understand we need those restrictions so 
that we know how to live together in a society.  If we allow 
people to exploit children in the name of the First 
Amendment, then that is the beginning of the destruction of 
a civilized society.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Yes, I mean, Bruce, it was interesting
as we went into the break, made the interesting observation
that the slippery slope actually works in the other
direction.  This is not a deterioration or erosion of the
First Amendment protections that we are talking about.  It
is actually flipping it the other way, and the erosion we
see is the protection of certain classes from certain kinds
of inappropriate and, certainly in this case, many cases,
illegal kinds of speech and material being provided to kids.
So we flip it the other way.

<p>

So all of a sudden it will be, well, I can go even
if I am a minor and rent that X-rated video, or I can go buy 
that X-rated book or X-rated magazine even if I am a minor.
That is the slope moving in the other direction, and that
ought to be what we are concerned about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you guys see the schizophrenia in 
the nanny state which is going to make curfews and is going 
to give you all kinds of information on sex and is going to 
tell you a million things, but then it is a restrictive 
atmosphere in government today.  You know, we are going to 
punish parents if the kids screw up, we are going to 
communicate drivers' issues to you -- this is how you drive 
a car -- we are going to communicate voting restrictions, we 
are going to communicate drinking restrictions, but no 
speech restrictions?  I mean, do you guys see any 
strangeness in their attitude on that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I think part of that is from, 
frankly, I think the ACLU has won the public debate on that 
to a large extent.  The ACLU has been able to convince 
enough people that if we touch speech, then our civilization 
will be destroyed, that people are very leery.  I mean, even 
conservatives, Christians, they think, gosh, we cannot touch 
speech.  Then we will not be able to share our faith or 
something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Then why not faith speech, though?
I mean, the same ACLU that says pornography is appropriate 
for children and embraces pedophilia kinds of information 
for children says that prayer in school will destroy 
America.  I mean, I know you have had a lot of experience 
with that, Colby.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, it is one of the freedoms in the 
First Amendment.  The free speech clause, the free press, 
all that sort of thing, they are great champions of and sort 
of this let it all hang out, who cares, sort of thing, but 
when you get to the religion clauses, the establishment and 
the exercise clauses, they have risen the establishment
clause to the point where it just gobbled up free exercise.
So the idea that in public, at least in public, I could go 
out and share my faith and say I believe in Jesus Christ or 
I am a follower of Mohammed or whatever the particular case 
may be, oh-oh, the Republic is at stake; no, you cannot do 
that, that is a real problem, and they refuse to see that 
there are free speech elements to that and that they ought 
to be on the same side in that context as they are out there 
arguing in other contexts on the free speech question.

<p>

But they do not, and it is one of those great 
ironies and one of those great inconsistencies that 
intellectuals everywhere seem to be able to deal with and 
just put in a different pocket and never be concerned about 
and go right on, and that is unfortunately what they have 
done.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR: You know, it is an odd thing that the 
ACLU even a few years ago -- everybody thought that they 
were a bunch of kooks, because they always had such radical 
opinions.  They wanted to legalize child porn and obscenity 
and drugs and guns, and they want to impose sex education 
and certain things on the public and take away the rights of 
parents to teach their kids, and yet they want to defend the 
pornographers.

<p>

What we essentially are doing with Congress and 
the courts is saying let's not change our laws.  The ACLU 
wants to repeal all the obscenity, child porn, harmful to 
minors, indecency laws.  We are saying we have had them for 
100 years.  We have never had nudity and sex on American 
television and radio; they want to put it on.  We have never 
let kids into porno movies or buy <i>Hustler</i> magazines.  They 
want to make that available.  They want to put pornography 
in the libraries.  I mean, they are fighting the revolution 
to change it.

<p>

All we are doing is saying we want to keep the 
laws that we have, and the Congress and the CDA merely 
extended the same protections that kids have in every other 
medium, print, electronic, radio, broadcasting, telephone, 
they just extended that to the Internet and said what you 
cannot sell a kid in a convenience store or you cannot show 
them on a street corner or you cannot beam to him on a 
radio, you cannot put on the Internet.  That is not a 
difference in law.  It is just the same law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bruce, what is the status now of the 
Communications Decency Act?  We had this three-judge panel.
What is going to happen next?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  It is on a fairly fast track.  The 
government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Supreme 
Court.  We kind of skipped the court of appeals.  The 
government will file a brief telling the court about the 
case.  The plaintiff, the ACLU, will file a brief saying 
don't hear this case.  The Supreme Court will, sometime this 
fall, either decide to send the case back down to the trial 
court and tell them, listen, you got this all wrong, start 
over, or they will hear the case and then come out with an 
opinion, and we think they will say the same thing if they 
come out with an opinion.  There is also another challenge 
like this in New York that will probably come out with their 
opinion within the next month or something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  An appeals court?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  No, it is another three-judge federal 
court in New York City that is hearing the same kind of 
challenge Philadelphia did.  I kind of think the New York 
court will come out with a different opinion than 
Philadelphia did.  Philadelphia was pretty radical.  I think 
the New York court will be more careful, and I think that 
between those two cases the Supreme Court will recognize 
that there are some serious issues here and send the cases 
back for them to take another look at it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Just for people to understand one 
more time, what was the most radical thing that came out of 
this three-judge panel, because I am not sure people 
understand.  They understand the Communications Decency Act 
was to apply to the Internet, and in particular, your 
concern was pornography.  What was the most radical thing 
about what the three judges said?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I think we each have our favorite 
worst parts of this opinion.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

The answer is my favorite worst horrible part of 
the opinion is when the judges said that any speech 
regulation on this Internet would ruin it, would destroy the 
Internet.  My response is any speech?  No child pornography 
regulation?  We cannot protect consumers in cyberspace?  You 
know, this is a sacred realm that cannot be touched by law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So I can lie about maybe drug use on 
the Internet.  Yes, you can use lye in your eyes.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  So I think that reveals that these 
judges are just off kilter.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  My thing is that we told the court to 
interpret indecency like the FCC and the Supreme Court does 
to apply to unprotected pornographic harmful stuff for kids, 
and the court instead bought the ACLU's argument that 
indecency means museum pieces, works of literature and art, 
AIDS information, and science and medical textbooks, and it 
almost looks so absurd for the court to have the power to 
limit the reach of indecency to the kind of material that 
would not be unconstitutional, and instead in their 
liberalism, they tried to criminalize all the conduct that 
they thought should be the most protected.

<p>

It is almost like -- I don't know what they are 
smoking, but it was an odd decision in that regard, because 
they could have fixed everything they said was broken, and 
yet they broke it even more.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, my own personal favorite was when 
Chief Judge Sloviter[?] said that the Internet was the most 
important development for direct democracy where you could 
have multi-point communications in real-time with multipoint 
other points and have this ongoing discussion, and in 
the reality of the ongoing discussion, we have this 
incredible invigoration of democracy.

<p>

She described this as chaos, and therefore, in 
order to make sure that we preserve the chaos of the 
Internet, we have to make sure that there are no speech 
restrictions.  This is a speech restriction; it is out.  For 
me, I just found that to be absurd, because we talk about 
ordered liberty in this country.  We talk about 
responsibility in the same breath for which you talk about 
freedom, and the idea that it is chaos and that that somehow 
is the spawning ground for American democracy I find to be 
astoundingly silly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A rather narrow reading of history.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary Bauer, President of the Family 
Research Council, made the interesting point after this case 
that if the Internet pollutes itself with pornography and 
all kind of insanity and false speech and 40-year-old men 
masquerading as 5-year-old girls, that eventually, rather 
than being the communications tool it is proclaimed to be, 
it will kill it, because people, families and people who 
might really use it, are going to get out.

<p>

Do you think that that is a realistic assessment?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR: I think that is why Congress passed 
the law, because just like they passed an indecency law 
saying you cannot put indecency on radio and television 60 
years ago to make TV and radio available to every home, and 
we put restrictions to protect kids in videos and magazines 
and everything else so industry can survive and so can kids, 
if the Internet becomes so toxic and unfriendly to children 
that they cannot use it safely, then what is it going to be 
in another 10 years that the next generation that could 
benefit the most will be able to use it the least?

<p>

So Congress was intending to open up the Internet 
to kids to be able to use it, not to close it, and that is 
why if it is only good for pornography -- if pornography is 
essential to the Internet, then it is not worth keeping, but 
if the Internet is good for everything else, then they will 
figure out a way to put pornography in its place so it does 
not ruin the Internet from being a universal communication.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Not to mention the majority of 
citizens in our country, women are a great minority on the 
Internet right now.  I wonder whether that has anything to 
do with the fact that pornography is completely free-wheeling. 
It always depicts women and degrades women, and 
most people on-line now are adult males making over $50,000.
It is somewhat of an elite group.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is, isn't it?

<p>

I have to thank my guests.  We are going to have 
to have you all back, especially after the next ruling.

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Look, in 1985, the ACLU said that 
child pornography is a sacred text that ought to be freely 
traded with no restrictions whatsoever.  At least we can say 
for the ACLU that they are consistent.  But what we have 
here is a --

<p>

MS. STRASSEN:  Cathy, I defend your --

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: -- either indecency or harmful to 
minor situation.  Let's look at reality.

<p>

MS. STRASSEN:  I would like to, but you are in a fantasy world.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Laws to protect children have been 
widely -- by liberals and conservatives -- under your 
agenda, Nadine, it is the bully who wins.  We care about 
children and about protecting children from pornography.  We 
are not talking about adults with this legislation.  We are 
talking about protecting children.  There is a wide 
consensus that the government has a role.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight 
on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are presenting some very important facts 
about homosexuality and marriage.  You will hear from 
experts who have examined the ramifications of destroying 
marriage to reshape it with same sex unions.  From 
psychiatrists to educators, Family Research Council brought 
experts together in a briefing on Capitol Hill to present 
their findings to the media and our country's legislators.

<p>

We will also see a clip from the news conference 
where grass roots leaders presented their views on changing 
marriage.  Why is this an issue?  Because aggressive 
homosexual activists have tried to change America through a 
court case now pending before liberal judges in Hawaii.  
That case could come down in August.  If you want to 
understand this radical change, stay tuned.

<p>

But first we bring you Gary Bauer, president of 
the Family Research Council, a long term expert on values 
discussions and a leading conservative political analyst.  
Let's here Gary's opening remarks.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing,  broadcast July 
2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. BAUER:  As the 20th century draws to a close, 
the United States finds itself in the middle of some fairly 
profound debate on a whole host of issues, and I suppose 
that is the way it should be in a democratic republic like 
ours.  The people ought to be debating the most important 
issues of the day.

<p>

We all are aware of the great debate taking place 
on the size of government and how big Washington ought to 
be.  As conservatives, we believe that Washington is too 
large and that bureaucracy is too extensive and it ought to 
be cut back.  There is a great debate taking place on the 
question of taxation, and once again, I think the issue is 
pretty clear.  I believe that the American people, American 
families, American workers, are overtaxed and that 
Washington, D.C. is overfed and needs to tighten its belt.

<p>

We are having a gigantic debate at the end of this 
century on the question of America's role in the world.  We 
were reminded of that again this week when once again flag-draped 
caskets came back from Saudi Arabia.  Whether it is 
Bosnia or Haiti or Somalia or Saudi Arabia, Americans will 
be debating for a long time our proper place in the world, 
where it is we should show the flag, and for what we will 
ask young men and women to pay the ultimate sacrifice.

<p>

These are all important issues.  They are all 
things that in a democratic republic the people must debate.  
But there is also a whole group of issues that are also 
important and profound, and I would argue in many ways even 
more profound than the issues I just mentioned to you.

<p>

They are issues that relate to values and to 
virtue and how it is that free men and women ought to live, 
what the purpose of our liberty is.  A little over 200 years 
ago, our founding fathers meeting in this week of the year 
debated these issues, and to a man they believed, whether 
they were Christian or agnostic or deist, they all believed 
that only a virtuous people could remain free.  There is a 
lot of evidence that in the last 30 years in the United 
States, we are setting out to prove the founding fathers 
wrong.  The culture mocks virtue in many ways.  Many people 
in Washington think that virtue is an outdated concept.

<p>

I am always marveling in events around the world 
how Americans will with great pride begin to chant "we are 
number one."  I have chanted that myself watching Olympic 
events or other events, but the fact of the matter is that 
the United States has become number one in a lot of things 
that ought to bring shame rather than honor.  Whether the 
issue is half of our marriages ending in divorce or a third 
of our children being born out of wedlock or the incredible 
amounts of pornography or child abuse or drug addiction, by 
many, many measurements the United States has moved away 
from virtue, and as a result, I think, is in deep, deep 
trouble.

<p>

One of those issues related to the role of liberty 
and the role of virtue is this issue of marriage and how 
define it.  For over 5,000 years of civilization, marriage 
has been defined as the bringing together of two individuals 
from opposite sexes.  It has always been defined that way in 
civilizations that are influenced by the Judeo-Christian 
value system, and I believe that clearly in America today 
the overwhelming majority of the American people, by most 
polls 80 percent, still understand and believe marriage to 
be the bringing together of a man and a woman.  Yet, we find 
ourselves in 1996 needing to debate this basic idea.  We 
need to debate it because the cultural elite of America 
seems confused about it.  We need to debate it because a few 
unelected judges in Hawaii are in danger of redefining a 
marriage for the whole country.

<p>

I would like to spend my time discussing and 
debating other issues, and I think it is terribly 
distressful that in the latter years of this century we have 
to debate such a basic concept.  But debate it we will.  We 
believe that this issue of how marriage is defined and the 
broader issue of the nature of our liberty and how it should 
be used are the most profound issues facing the United 
States as we go into the next century.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. HEKMAN:  We are kind of forced into this 
particular arena, not because this is a choice on our part 
that we have to glom onto this particular issue at this 
time, but because there is a decision in Hawaii, far-off 
Hawaii, of an obscure court there that has the implication 
or the possibility of impacting laws across the states, the 
other 49 states.  So we would suggest to you that without 
one vote being taken in the state of Michigan by the 
legislature, without even a court decision in the state of 
Michigan, that Michigan's laws that have existed since we 
were a state would significantly change in a very 
undemocratic method.  There is no more undemocratic method 
than such as this where an obscure court makes a decision 
significantly impacting the law in the state of Michigan in 
a particularly important area.  Few people deny that the 
definition of what marriage is is incredibly important to a 
culture.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.  In FRC-sponsored Defense of 
Marriage briefing, Dr. Jeffrey Satinover, a psychiatrist and 
author, stated some key findings that have a great impact on 
society's view of homosexuality.  Dr. Satinover is a former 
fellow in psychiatry and child psychiatry at Yale, past 
president of the C.J. Young[?] Foundation, and holds degrees 
from MIT, the University of Texas, and Harvard University.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing follows.]

<p>

DR. SATINOVER:  There is certainly no instance 
anywhere in history, including ancient pagan cultures, where 
the proposition has been put forward that there is a 
reasonable basis for society in anything other than the 
union of a man and a woman for the purpose of establishing 
the family.  Now the fact that that has been historically 
true, of course, speaking as a scientist, does not mean that 
it inevitably must be true.  It is conceivable that we may 
be holding onto dearly cherished opinions for 3,500 years 
which are in fact mistaken, but the burden of proof rests 
with those who would in fact alter traditions such as those.

<p>

Central to this debate is the question of 
homosexuality and what it is, and it has long been known 
among proponents of an activist agenda that it is crucially 
important to alter public opinion and public sentiment on 
the question as to the nature of homosexuality before one 
can successfully make an argument to alter the family 
structure so as to include homosexuality as a reasonable 
part of it.

<p>

Thus, quite some time ago, 15 or 20 years ago, a 
series of studies were done to examine a key point.  Let me 
read you a portion of one of these studies.  To measure the 
relationship between beliefs about the determinance of 
homosexual orientation and attitudes toward homosexuals, 745 
respondents in four different societies were queried about 
their beliefs, and the following point emerged.

<p>

Analysis indicated that subjects who believed that 
homosexuals are born that way held significantly more 
positive attitudes toward homosexuals than subjects who 
believed that homosexuals choose to be that way and/or learn 
to be that way.  There is a well-known public relations 
effect to be had from making the claim that homosexuality is 
innate, genetic, and -- the key point -- therefore 
unchangeable.

<p>

Now there have been in the last 6 or 7 years a 
series of studies.  There is a broad awareness of three 
different kinds of studies that have been put forth, largely 
by the media, as demonstrating the fact, the supposed fact, 
that homosexuality is innate, genetic, and unchangeable.  
Those studies fall into three categories.  One are brain 
changes.  The other are family or so-called twin studies, 
and the third is the search for chromosomal linkages.  The 
nature of all of these studies that have been done on 
homosexuality demonstrate a biological component to it that 
is intrinsically no different than the kind of biological 
component you would find if you examined basketball players.

<p>

Now here is how that works.  First of all, brain 
changes.  Most people presume that the brain does not 
physically change as a consequence of behavior, and that is 
an old idea.  The truth is the brain changes dramatically as 
a result of behavior.  When this was first put forth as an 
argument against brain changes, studies, the studies that 
were done, a wisecracking commentator made a remark about 
only fundamentalists believing that. 

<p>

However, the editor of <i>Nature</i>, probably the 
world's premier scientific journal, commenting on that 
research himself, said plainly the neural correlates of 
genetically determined gender are plastic structures in the 
hypothalamus and could allow the consequences of sexual 
arousal to be made permanent.

<p>

A clear example of how this happens:  in 
individuals who become blind as adults and then learned 
Braille, the part of the brain governing the right index 
finger became progressively enlarged.  What we do with our 
lives not only changes our character and our personality, it 
will also have an effect in the brain.

<p>

Second, twin studies.  The most widely touted set 
of studies supposedly show that among identical twins there 
is an increased incidence of either both being homosexual or 
both being heterosexual such that it points to a genetic 
determination of homosexuality.  Now, first, I am going to 
read you two paragraphs from the very study that is cited as 
evidence.

<p>

The opening paragraphs:  these studies were 
designed to detect heritable variation, and if it was 
present, to counter the prevalent belief that sexual 
orientation is largely the product of family interactions 
and the social environment.  Now you will notice that this 
is a scientific study being done for a political purpose, 
which of course is not right to begin with.

<p>

Nonetheless, this is what the authors concluded:  
although male and female homosexuality appear to be at least 
somewhat heritable, environment must also be of considerable 
importance in their origins.  Now that paragraph from their 
study is never quoted in public.  In fact, other 
commentators, other scientific commentators, have said very 
clearly -- for example, two authors from Harvard and the <i>MIT 
Technology Review</i>; both are geneticists; one is the head of 
the largest genetics faculty in the country.

<p>

While the authors -- referring to the same study -- while 
the authors interpreted their findings as evidence 
for a genetic basis for homosexuality, we think that the 
data, in fact, provide strong evidence for the influence of 
the environment.  Now there are science writers currently 
going around saying that there is absolutely no argument on 
the point that homosexuality is genetic, and that is flatly 
wrong.  The majority of well-informed behavioral geneticists 
understand that the current research only shows a heritable 
influence, which is not terribly specific, and that most of 
the research actually demonstrates the opposite of what is 
being claimed.

<p>

Now heritable influence is something that I will 
explain very briefly, but before I do, let me also quote you 
from the author of the most widely cited study on 
chromosomal leukogens[?].  This is the study about which 
major news weeklies headed across their cover "Gay Gene," 
and you may have seen another one on a related topic about 
adultery, "Adultery, In Our Genes?"

<p>

When pressed by scientists to explain the 
discrepancy between the way his findings were being reported 
and what his findings actually demonstrated, this author 
said the following:  the relationships among genes and 
environment probably have a somewhat different effect on 
someone in Salt Lake City than if that person were growing 
up in New York City, i.e. liberal Manhattan, conservative 
Utah, difference in outcome as to whether an individual is 
or is not going to be homosexual.  The bottom line of that 
statement is a clear acknowledgment that the social 
environment has a dramatic effect on the incidence of 
homosexuality.  What does it mean for something to have 
genetic influence or genetic linkage or genetic association 
or heritable influence?  It does not mean what most people 
think it means.  Most people do not understand enough about 
behavioral genetics to realize that that phrase means almost 
nothing, and a good behavioral geneticist will tell you that 
heritable variation is a meaningless finding.

<p>

Here is what it means.  If you look at a group of 
basketball players, you will find, first of all, that their 
brains are different than the brains of non-basketball 
players, because those areas of the brain responsible for 
repeated basketball playing will have grown larger.

<p>

Point number two.  If you look at family studies, 
you will see that if one identical twin is a basketball 
player, even if the second twin is raised in another family, 
the second twin is also likely to be a basketball player, 
not because there is a gene for basketball playing, but for 
the simple reason that height and athleticism are factors 
which are inherited and which will make basketball playing 
more likely.  Therefore, if the one is, the other is.  The 
principle here is that heritable variation points only 
toward intermediate traits which themselves need not have 
anything to do with the subject you are studying.  So for 
example, it is quite possible that the intermediate trait, 
which predisposes to homosexuality or intermediate traits, 
would include such things as sensitivity, shyness, a 
tendency to be more interested in the world of the mind.  I 
would not be surprised, in fact, if intelligence itself, to 
the extent that it has a heritable component, correlates in 
the same way with homosexuality.

<p>

I cannot give you evidence to prove that, because 
the political process has prevented the kind of reasonable 
scientific studies that should be done on this subject, 
especially considering how many people struggle with it.

<p>

Change.  There were about 50 years of outcome 
studies on treatment of homosexuality using a variety of 
modalities.  Some of those methods, we have come to believe, 
are inappropriate and should not be used, but the majority 
of methods are simply psychotherapeutic.  They involve 
nothing more than talking and exploring the underlying 
sufferings that help give rise to homosexuality in 
vulnerable individuals.

<p>

Here is an example, just one study, with long-term 
follow-up.  Of 49 patients who were able by a previous 
therapy to control their homosexuality, 63 percent were 
contacted for follow-up.  The average period since the end 
of treatment was 4 years.  Nineteen -- 61 percent -- have 
remained exclusively heterosexual.  There are more details 
of this.

<p>

If you look at outcome studies up until the 
American Psychiatric Association basically killed off the 
field by removing homosexuality from the DSM as a diagnosis, 
you find a consistent result of anywhere from 25 to 75 
percent success rate, with an average rate of success of 
over 50 percent.

<p>

Now I will close by making the following 
observation.  If you look at the heavily funded program 
aimed at changing high risk sexual behavior among at-risk 
homosexual males, you find a long-term success rate just in 
changing the dangerous behaviors which is actually somewhat 
worse than the results for changing sexual orientation 
altogether.  Given that epidemiologists now acknowledge from 
multiple studies around the country that among 20-year-old 
men who identify themselves as gay, 30 percent will either 
be HIV-positive or dead of AIDS by the time they are 30, 
even if a success rate of 10 percent were available, it is 
in my view morally reprehensible that we are not making a 
determined effort to do everything possible to help people 
leave homosexuality who wish to.

MR. MANSFIELD:  Public opinion drives public 
policy, whether it is in Washington, D.C., or in Boise, 
Idaho, or New Jersey.  It does not matter where you are at.  
Public opinion drives public policy.

<p>

In fact, the New Jersey ACLU just this past week 
stated it is a shame that we have some radical heterosexuals 
who are activists who want to create special rights for 
straight people.  We felt in Idaho that if moms and dads who 
attend soccer practices, who put their babies to sleep, who 
wake up every morning and take care of things, that if they 
are radical extremists, then somebody somewhere is out of 
line.

<p>

Now ladies and gentlemen, supporting the 
prohibition of same sex marriage, it is not unkind and it is 
not uncompassionate.  From the heartland of Idaho, it just 
makes sense.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are presenting 
the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing on Capitol Hill.  
Dr. Hadley Arkes, professor of jurisprudence at American 
institutions at Amherst College and contributing editor to 
major national publications, takes a look at what would 
happen if we changed the definition of marriage in the 
context of the law.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. ARKES:  I want to take a moment to remind the 
press and the public about what it is that created a certain 
urgency for the Defense of Marriage Act.  It was not merely 
the litigation percolating in Hawaii, because that had been 
going on for along time.  Matters had to move along quickly 
because there was an awareness of <i>Romer versus Evans</i>, the 
Colorado case then pending before the Supreme Court.  When I 
testified on May 15, we were expecting that case any day, 
and it turned out it was decided on May 20.  It was quite as 
bad as many of us anticipated it would be.

<p>

The court in that case struck down a 
constitutional amendment in Colorado that refused to treat 
gays and lesbians as a protected or favored class.  We will 
hear, of course, many different accounts of that case, but 
in my own reading, that case will be read by many activists 
among the judges to produce this lesson, that a state may 
not incorporate anywhere in its laws or public policy an 
adverse judgment on homosexuality, and it may not refuse to 
accord to homosexuality the same standing or legitimacy that 
attaches to that sexuality imprinted in our natures.

<p>

With this move, the court may have armed federal 
judges to tie up any legislation in a state that refused to 
honor homosexual marriages.  After all, the argument could 
run that the state refuses to credit this marriage only 
because of the gender or the sexual orientation of the 
couple.  Would this not be then on its face but another 
discrimination directed at gays and lesbians?

<p>

When we look at <i>Romer versus Evans</i> and how that is 
complicating the situation, we do not have to be confined to 
speculation.  We simply follow the precise warning cast up 
by Justice Scalia in his dissenting opinion.  As Scalia 
pointed out, the Association of American Law Schools now 
require all of their members to extract this pledge from law 
firms that are interviewing candidates that the employer 
would be willing hire homosexuals.

<p>

At the same time, the Supreme Court has now 
declared in the <i>Romer</i> case that the people who hold to the 
traditional Jewish and Christian teaching on sexuality are 
fueled by an irrational animus.  Now as far as I know, no 
moral court has managed yet to refute the traditional Jewish 
and Christian teaching on this ancient problem, and yet the 
court has now pronounced that teaching to be vacuous, to be 
connected to no plausible or defensible purpose.

<p>

As Scalia has observed, the court now declares 
serious Christians and Jews to be nothing less than bigots.  
So as we put these strands together, they start pointing in 
this direction.  Is there not an incentive now for law firms 
to gauge whether senior partners or young associates harbor 
views that may put the firm at odds with the regulations 
bearing on the law schools.  While affecting no prejudice, 
mind you, toward people who are serious about their 
religion, the law firms may nevertheless screen out people 
who acknowledge their seriousness as Christians and Jews.

<p>

And the incentives will not emanate simply from 
the conventions of the law schools.  After all, if the 
Supreme Court itself has now declared that a moral objection 
to homosexuality is indefensible, irrational, the 
distillation of an unreasoned prejudice or animus, does the 
court not in fact install the predicate for grievances and 
litigation?

<p>

If the young gay associate is denied standing as a 
partner, could it not be claimed now that the climate in the 
firm was poisoned from the outset or set in a discriminatory 
cast by the presence of senior partners who bore moral 
reservations about homosexuality, and what could be said 
about the law firms could be said even more forcefully about 
the colleges and the universities, and given the litigious 
experience these days in the academy, we can virtually count 
on the fact that grievances will be filed.

<p>

What if a member of an academic department has 
simply done what I have done, given testimony in public or 
published an article staking out a position, reaching a 
moral judgment on some of these questions, on gay marriage?  
Might that supply a prima facic[?] route for a grievance 
later?  Might it not be argued -- in fact, won't it be 
argued that the situation was at least biased or tilted from 
the very outset by the presence of that member of the 
faculty?

<p>

Can we not then expect certain kinds of pressures 
to suggest that his presence during the process of tenure 
would be inappropriate?  Perhaps his presence during the 
hiring process would be inappropriate.  In fact, being 
prudent about these matters, it might be better simply to 
forestall the problem at the root by failing to hire people 
of this kind who generate problems later.  Some of what you 
have here in <i>Romer versus Evans</i> is a rather clean device for 
purging from the professions and the universities those 
people who are overly religious, overly serious about the 
traditional teachings of Judaism and Christianity.  It is a 
very powerful weapon.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  When Missouri found itself in the 
unconscionable position of having to defend marriage in 
response to the situation in Hawaii, the legislators began 
to hear such things as this legislation is unnecessary, or 
come on, guys; we do not need this shameful hate-mongering 
in our state, and as the debate began to rise, the same 
issue began to come up time and again, and we also began to 
hear things like this is not a gay issue, this is not a 
homosexual issue, but this issue is being brought to the 
forefront by this radical right.

<p>

I am here to submit to you today that those two 
components come straight out of the pages or the playbook, 
if you will, from the same sex marriage proponents.  In its 
manual <i>To Have and To Hold</i>, the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force sets forth their legislative agenda, and it reads 
rather simply:  stall the bill, shepherd it into less 
hostile committees, define the bill to the press and 
politicians in terms of benefits or strategy, and they go on 
to say to urge politicians to say the bill is unnecessary or 
that we do not need this shameful hate-mongering in our 
state.

<p>

In addition to that, the other side of the 
argument was that this issue was not being brought up by the 
homosexuals.  In fact, several testified that they were not 
really ready for same-sex marriage, that they had not really 
had a chance to think this out.  In its manual Lambda puts 
forth in the marriage project, it calls the case in Hawaii 
and several other cases, its case.  They go on to say that 
for the last 5 years they have been working on these cases, 
forum shopping for judges, working with law students, 
lawyers, and people across the states to bring this back and 
make it a state by state issue.

<p>

So as we began to look at that in Missouri -- it 
is the old don't tell me show me state -- we began to look 
more and more at some of the things that were occurring 
across the United States, and we were not alone, and as 
people began to step up to podium you began to hear things 
like history proves that no society which has ever redefined 
sexual morality outside of one man one woman marriage has 
ever survived, and we began to look around us and to see 
things in our own culture that led us to believe that the 
culture in Missouri and perhaps the culture in America would 
not fare any better than any prior civilization's.

<p>

So as a result, the Missouri General Assembly 
overwhelmingly passed language in defense of marriage.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We will now hear from Robert 
Knight, FRC's Director of Cultural Studies.  Bob examines 
the legal, social, and cultural ramifications of same sex 
marriage on our society.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Most Americans believe in the 
philosophy of live and let live.  I do not think there is 
any widespread sentiment for persecuting homosexuals in this 
country.  As a matter of fact, they have achieved an 
enormous deal of tolerance.  But what they are trying to do 
now is go beyond that tolerance and to harness the power of 
the law and of corporations increasingly to force 
affirmation of homosexuality on those who disagree with the 
idea that it is healthy and normal and moral.

<p>

If homosexual marriage is legalized -- and I use 
marriage in quotes, because it is a non sequiter; there is 
no such thing as homosexual marriage, marriage being the 
union of a man and a woman -- this would create a situation 
where people who are of devout Christian, Jewish, or Muslim 
beliefs, or if they are atheists who just happen to think 
that marriage ought to be between a man and a woman, find 
themselves outside the law.

<p>

We will have the prospect of business people being 
forced to subsidize homosexual relationships or face legal 
sanction.  We will face the prospect of children being 
taught that homosexuality is normal in school, because how 
could they be taught otherwise if the state sets aside 
status and privileges that make homosexual relationships on 
a par with marriage?  The reason marriage has special 
benefits built in at the legal, cultural, and social levels 
is because it is indispensable to the survival of 
civilization.  No other institution does for civilization 
what marriage does.

<p>

While homosexuals say they only want tolerance, 
they are being dishonest, I believe, about that.  They are 
quite intolerant with anyone who disagrees with them, and if 
you do not think that is true, ask the Boy Scouts of 
America.  They are under legal attack in states where the 
gay rights laws are already on the books, and the Scouts are 
basically being told you abandon the moral traditions that 
you have had for 80 years in raising boys to be men, and you 
have place homosexuals over young boys on camping trips, or 
we will see that you face legal ruin.  We will litigate and 
litigate until you cry uncle.

<p>

Mind you, the Scouts are a private organization, 
and that parents in a free country ought to be able to 
entrust their children to an organization that reflects 
their most deeply held beliefs.  One would think in a free 
country they could do that, but gay activists do not think 
so.  They want to force their agenda right into the Boy 
Scout troops.  That is tyranny.  That is not tolerance.

<p>

Here is an example of where we are headed if the 
gay rights movement is not turned back.  In Hamilton, 
Ontario -- and I got this out of an article by David Fromm 
in a Canadian magazine -- in Hamilton, Ontario, gay 
activists came to the mayor, and they said, look, we want 
you to issue a proclamation to celebrate Gay Pride Week.  
Now Hamilton is a blue collar Catholic town, and the mayor 
has no ax to grind with gays, but he said, look, I don't 
think this would sit well with most of my constituents, and 
I just don't want to do it.

<p>

He was hauled before a Human Rights Commission 
under the gay rights law, and he was fined personally 
$5,000, and the charge was that he was sowing hatred and was 
gay-bashing, merely for not celebrating what most of the 
people in Hamilton considered something immoral.  That is 
where we are headed with gay rights.  That is the real 
agenda.  You celebrate it, you affirm it, or we will bring 
legal sanctions against you.

<p>

Homosexuality has been discouraged in all cultures 
in all eras, because it is destructive.  The truth should 
finally be told about it, but what you read in the media is 
not what the gay lifestyle is all about.  I was in the media 
for 15 years as a reporter and editor, 7 of them at the Los 
Angeles Times, and I can tell you that in those news rooms 
all across America, there is a reluctance to deal with the 
behavior of homosexuality, with scientific studies that 
contradict the major claims of gay activists, particularly 
in the genetic area, and to propagate certain myths that 
move the agenda along.

<p>

In a brief time, I would like to go through some 
of those myths.  The 10 percent myth, that 10 percent of the 
population is homosexual.  That stems from the discredited 
Kinsey studies of the 1940s.  It has not been replicated, 
and there are 30 reliable studies from around the globe 
showing that it is under 3 percent and more probably under 2 
or 1 percent, and yet you still see it used.

<p>

The genetic studies.  Dr. Satinover addressed 
them.  Suffice it to say you can drive a truck through these 
studies.  The twin studies, in particular, for identical 
twins show that if half of them are not gay, then how can it 
possibly be genetic.  If you know what identical twins are, 
it is the exact same genetic material.  These studies, if 
anything, undercut the claim that there is a genetic 
component.

<p>

Gay teen suicide, and you will probably hear more 
about this later from Pete LaBarbara[?], there is this claim 
that one in three teen suicides is gay.  That came out of a 
single report in 1989 by a gay activist named Paul 
Gibson[?].  His report was repudiated by Louis Sullivan, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, and it has been 
criticized deeply by experts in the field like David 
Schaeffer[?] of Columbia University, and yet you see it used 
constantly to justify programs in public schools.

<p>

Psychological studies.  In the 1950s, a UCLA 
psychologist named Evelyn Hooker[?] gathered 30 homosexual 
men and 30 heterosexual men and put them through some 
psychological tests.  She was trying to prove -- and she 
told interviewers later -- trying to prove that gays were no 
different from non-gays.  In two of the three tests, the 
gays were picked right out by the independent judge.  They 
sexualized everything in the tests.

<p>

Yet, that is never revealed in the media.  The 
media keeps saying, well, these studies of Evelyn Hooker 
show that gays are no different; they are normal.  That 
study was the major piece of evidence cited in 1973 when the 
American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from 
its list of disorders.  This is bad science, and it has been 
used in a very political way.

<p>

Finally, gay parenting studies.  We hear them all 
the time in the quest for expanded adoption opportunities 
for gays.  If you look at all of these studies, they have 
tiny sample sizes, 8 or 9 people.  Most of the people know 
each other in the other study groups.  The people were 
recruited by gay activist publications, and the studies are 
done by lesbian activists.

<p>

But even with all of that, if you add up the 
children in all these studies, the weight of evidence shows 
that the children are four times as likely to either have a 
homosexual orientation later in life or to experiment with 
homosexuality.  Doesn't that make sense?  Children model 
their behavior after their parents.  Why would we be 
surprised that kids in gay households might try homosexual 
sex?  After all, if mom and mom are doing it, or dad and 
dad, why not the kids?  This is a threat to children.  It is 
a way to lead them into a destructive behavior that will 
diminish their lives.

<p>

The language of gay rights is tolerance.  We just 
keep hearing that word.  We hear diversity also misused.  
But the aim is raw power, to basically criminalize dissent 
on this issue.  If you are identified as an opponent of gay 
rights, you are going to have a rough time.  That is across 
the board in this country now, and it has to stop.  The 
truth should be told about homosexuality, and that is that 
it is changeable; it does not lead to a happy life; there is 
a way out; and more people should know about it.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MS. DEALY:  Society has long recognized that men 
and women are different.  They bring different strengths, 
different perspectives, different ideas, and different 
insights into relationships, and when they are combined as a 
unit, there has the strongest building block for all 
society, but especially for the effects that that has and 
what that brings to children, and even in California, where 
anything goes and there is rare consensus on public policy 
issues, there is overwhelming support for traditional 
marriage.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.  We now bring you the impact 
legalizing same sex unions would have on your children at 
school.  Linda Page, a former school principal, education 
consultant and writer, presents what she has already seen 
take place due to homosexual activism and her prediction on 
what that would look like nationally.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MS. PAGE:  As we look at what the education scene 
is about, without being denigrating or without in any way 
diminishing the role of dedicated caring teachers, we see 
that we have folks that jump on bandwagons right and left.  
We see a culture in education that is driven by whatever the 
latest thing is.  That comes from the fact that teachers are 
the kind of people who want to make a difference with 
students.  They go into education because they want to 
prepare them to have better lives.  So they are always 
looking for better ways of doing things, and they are always 
looking for more effective things that will work.

<p>

Why do we have these people who find themselves in 
situations that really actually bring harm to students?  We 
have state and federal mandates that educators are bound to 
fulfill.  We have local mandates that educators are bound to 
fulfill.  Take, for example, the Rainbow Curriculum in New 
York City a few years ago.  That caused a major public 
outcry, because we had activists there who wanted to make 
certain that every child had positive self-esteem regardless 
of the kind of family they came from.  That relates very, 
very specifically to same sex marriage.

<p>

I brought a copy of one of the books that I would 
like to share a few pages with you from.  This book is 
called "Heather Has Two Mommies," and this is the kind of 
thing as we move toward a bandwagon which would ensue if we 
have federal mandates or state mandates that would result 
from same sex marriage being legalized and having the force 
of law behind it.  This is the kind of thing that we could 
expect in our primary children's classrooms.

<p>

This is Heather.  She lives in a little house with 
a big apple tree in the front yard and lots of tall grass in 
the back yard.  Heather's favorite number is two.  She has 
two arms, two legs, two eyes, two ears, two hands, and two 
feet.  Heather has two pets, a ginger colored cat named 
Ginger Snap and a big black dog named Midnight.

<p>

Heather also has two mommies, Mama Jane and Mama 
Kate.  A long, long time ago before Heather was born, Mama 
Jane and Mama Kate were very good friends, only they weren't 
mommies then; they were just Jane and Kate.  Kate lived on 
one side of town with Midnight, and Jane lived on the other 
side of town with Ginger Snap.

<p>

After they were friends for a long, long time, 
Kate and Jane realized that they were very much in love with 
each other.  They decided they wanted to live together and 
be a family together.  So Jane and Kate and Midnight and 
Ginger Snap all moved into the little house with the big 
apple tree in the front yard and the tall grass in the back 
yard, and they were all very happy, except for one thing.

<p>

Kate and Jane wanted to have a baby.

<p>

I am not going to finish reading this, but this is 
the kind of book that we could expect in our classrooms for 
primary readers if we have same sex marriage legalized.  
What we can expect overall if this situation takes place is 
a complete overhaul of curricula in general, staff 
development programs, teacher training programs, textbooks.  
We can expect an erosion of parental rights.

<p>

What we will see are kids who have already been 
instilled with values clarifications notions, which says 
that all values are equal, which is a totally ludicrous 
thought when we consider the horrific Saudi Arabian bombing 
last week.  All values are not equal, but our kids will be 
indoctrinated and immersed in a culture and in rhetoric and 
in education curricula which completely changes their view 
of themselves and of the world, and it is absolutely 
essential that we protect our kids who are very, very tender 
and very pliable from this danger.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Same sex marriage is now prohibited in 
the state of Illinois.  It has been signed by the governor.  
The majority vote in the House was 83 in favor of this bill 
prohibiting same sex marriage and 12 against.  In the 
Illinois Senate, 43 to prohibit same sex marriage, and 7 
against.

<p>

Any time we have gotten into debates about welfare 
reform, criminal justice, inevitably these kinds of issues 
look back to what are the causes of some of the problems, 
and it is broken families time and time again.  So the kinds 
of issues that had sensitized our general assembly had 
already been talked about.  Intact families are the best 
place for kids, and to think that all of a sudden we are 
going to destroy this concept of marriage that has been the 
basis of our societal stability for hundreds, probably 
thousands, of years, was outrageous.

<p>

MR. OSTRANDER:  The fact is that each of us and 
each of us in the context of our families live in a cultural 
ecosystem, and this ecosystem, I think, is more fragile than 
we care to note.  The fact is several years ago William 
Bennett did shed some light on it in his index of leading 
cultural indicators, and with that report, what we saw was a 
kind of toxicity in our culture.  What I am referencing is 
the rate of divorce.  I am referencing promiscuity of all 
kinds.  I am referencing spousal abuse, child abuse, 
substance abuse, illegitimacy, poverty, any number of 
things, all of which should be looked at as a toxicity to 
the health and well-being of our families.

<p>

When an ecosystem is threatened to this degree, 
the environmentalist is not content with a redefinition of 
the ecosystem or a redefinition of what we use to measure 
the health of that ecosystem.

<p>

We must not at this time redefine marriage and 
redefine family.  We must, instead, put our efforts to 
strengthening the family, the tried and true, the 
traditional, that which has for generations given us layer 
of leadership after leadership that could move freely in the 
realms of government, in the realms of business, in the 
realms of the spiritual, in all realms.

<p>

We simply cannot allow a small handful of judges 
whose ideas about the family are different, far different, 
from the average American's to dictate to the rest of 
America what the American family is and what it should be 
and what it will be for generations to come.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we continue the presentation of 
our recent FRC-sponsored Defense of Marriage Briefing, which
took place in the Capitol Building before a distinguished
Hill audience.

<p>

This is especially timely because of the House's 
critical vote in which the Defense of Marriage Act passed by 
a vote of 342 to 67.  Now the battle moves to the Senate.
To understand the issues at play, we will show some experts 
who present crucial information regarding the impact 
legalizing same-sex marriage would have on children, their 
development, school curriculum, adoption law, and our places 
of worship.

<p>

You will be introduced to a former homosexual who 
now devotes his life and his ministry to helping those who 
would like to escape the homosexual lifestyle, and we'll 
hear from leaders of grass-roots organizations talking about 
the impact changing marriage would have on the states.

<p>

Tonight's show promises to be an informative one, 
full of exclusive information and facts that the media does 
not usually divulge.

<p>

We will begin with Anthony Falzarano, executive 
director of Transformation Christian Ministry.  Anthony, a 
former homosexual, truly understands the destructiveness the 
lifestyle brings into a person's life.  Let's hear what he 
had to say about his own experience and views on same-sex 
marriage.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
Capitol Hill, July 2, 1996 follows:]

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  My name is Anthony Falzarano.  I 
am the executive director of Transformation Ex-Gay Christian 
Ministries in Washington, D.C.  We are the Washington, D.C., 
affiliate of Exodus International, which is the largest ex-gay 
network in the world.  We have over 120 ministries 
worldwide, and we offer hope to the repentant homosexual 
community.

<p>

We are one of four ex-gay networks in the world, 
and currently there are over 200 ministries to help 
homosexuals who desire to leave the gay lifestyle behind.

<p>

The United States of America has taken a dangerous 
moral nosedive in the last 35 years, and it is time to say 
enough is enough to the enemies of this country that have 
been allowed to infiltrate the halls of Congress with their 
voices of destruction.

<p>

The politically motivated homosexual community in 
this country has stepped over the line.  This movement is 
extremely well funded and well connected.  It has been 
working for the last 30 years like an army of termites, 
secretly eating away the floorboards of moral integrity in 
this country.  It is time to expose the agenda of these gay 
political organizations.

<p>

The gay community shocked us in the 1970s by 
coming out of the closet.  They gained our sympathy in the 
1980s with the horrible pandemic called AIDS.  And they are 
now trying, in the 1990s, to force our acceptance of this 
lifestyle using the legal systems of this country.

<p>

I speak to you today not as an observer of the 
homosexual community but as one of them.  I am a former 
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 
until the time I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle 
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.

<p>

What I didn't realize is that although I didn't 
choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay; that I 
had a choice; that I could change my orientation from gay to 
straight, and that is what Exodus did for me nine years ago. 
I am now happily married and I have two children, and only 
by the grace of God, after having over 400 sexual partners, 
I am HIV negative.

<p>

My healing process was a long and difficult one.
However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay 
networks are currently ministering to over 10,000 former 
homosexuals, and our phones are literally ringing off the 
hooks.  We are growing in leaps and bounds.

<p>

Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that 
initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all 
kinds of bondage and eventually kills us.  I have lost over 
35 of my friends and acquaintances to the disease of AIDS, 
and I don't want to see one more person contract this deadly 
disease.

<p>

The organized gay community in this country is 
telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease, and 
although it is spreading into the heterosexual population in 
this country very quickly, the facts are, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control, that 61 percent of people that 
have AIDS are homosexual men.

<p>

America needs to start helping homosexuals recover 
from sexual brokenness.  Eighty percent of the people that 
come to Transformation have been sexually molested and/or 
raped as children.  Homosexuals are victims.  Homosexuals in 
most instances do not bond with their same-sex parent, and 
we need to start helping homosexuals.  We must love the 
homosexual and hate the sin that they are involved in.

<p>

Putting a stamp of approval on this lifestyle by 
legally recognizing it and even calling it marriage is not 
really helping homosexuals; it is perpetuating a false myth 
of happiness.  Many people believe that if I can marry, then 
all of my problems concerning homosexuality will be over.
That is a myth.

<p>

QUESTION: I have a question for Mr. Falzarano.
What brought about your personal transformation, if you 
don't mind going into that, and a little bit more about the 
transformational ministries and what they do to help the 
homosexual transform?  I am curious about that.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  My past life is very public, so I 
don't mind sharing any detail of it.

<p>

Basically, one of the strong motivations, 
obviously, was my conversion to Christianity.  I began to 
look at the Holy Scriptures and see that Jesus says, if you 
love me, you will refrain from all sexual immorality, and, 
obviously, I was highly promiscuous.  Not all homosexuals 
are, but there were a large amount of my friends that were.

<p>

So I began to look at my personal life and 
realized that I had to clean up my act.  And then I got 
married 12 years ago, thinking that that would cure my 
homosexuality, because there was not help like there is 
today and I had no one to go to, so I thought, well, I would 
do the right thing and get married, and that would surely 
cure my homosexuality.

<p>

One third of the people we help at Transformation 
are married men and women, so we know that marriage does not 
cure homosexuality.  I needed to look within myself, and 
that is what Exodus helped me look at.  I was a victim of 
sexual abuse as a child; I was sexually molested five times 
as a child.

<p>

I had a physically present father but a 
psychologically absent father.  He was there every night.
My parents were married for 50 years.  On the surface it 
looked like a great marriage, and it was a decent marriage, 
but my father was psychologically unavailable to me.  Those 
were some of my root causes.

<p>

So when I came to Exodus, I had to deal with a lot 
of those issues, a lot of anger inside, especially directed 
to my perpetrators.  Forgiveness -- I had to look at my 
father and my mother, look at the reality that with seven 
children they had a full plate and that he did probably the 
best that he was able to do.  So a lot of forgiveness in 
that area.

<p>

I had to stop my physical acting out.  I was 
addicted to masturbation and pornography.  Many homosexuals 
are, male homosexuals.  I had to put aside all of my 
addiction and get some therapy for that to understand why I 
was falling into that kind of behavior.

<p>

And as I began to lay all of that aside in my life 
and deal with those issues, I began to have proper sexual 
attraction to my wife.  I can say now that we have quite a 
successful marriage after 12 years.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Press 
Conference, National Press Club, June 24, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MR. PAULTON: Why are South Dakotans so decisive 
about this issue?  First, they understand that, throughout 
the course of history, marriage has been the foundation of 
society.  It uniquely brings the sexes together to form the 
foundation, the framework for the family.

<p>

In South Dakota we believe that our most precious 
resource is the family.  As Joe mentioned, with all of the 
dysfunctions, the social dysfunctions that we see around us, 
this is no time to toy with the very building block of the 
family.

<p>

Secondly, this is also a state's rights issue.  As 
has been said very well here, this is a decision that should 
be left to the people of each individual state.  The people 
of South Dakota have spoken clearly on this issue, and their 
elected officials have spoken clearly.  That decision should 
rest with each individual state, not with a few people in a 
far-away Hawaii court.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. In the FRC-sponsored Defense 
of Marriage Briefing, Dr. Brenda Destro focused on the 
potential ramifications that same-sex marriage would have 
upon teen sexuality.  Dr. Destro, who served as a social 
work consultant for the U.S. Department of Health and 
Services, shares her experience regarding child sexual 
identity development and the same-sex debate.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing of 
July 2, 1996, continues:]

<p>

DR. DESTRO:  Before I talk about the relationship 
between sex education and homosexuality, I want to just give 
you a little background on sex education, which was 
originally a product of the public health community as a 
method of primary prevention or education to help sexually 
active teens prevent pregnancy, usually using medical 
technology.

<p>

Even though these programs and the evaluation 
studies that have overseen them for the past probably 20 
years have continually shown that sex education has little 
or no impact on teenage pregnancy, it has continued to 
expand in both its approach and its audience and is now 
widely available in public and private schools throughout 
the United States.

<p>

So the sex education programs that many, many, 
many, many teenagers are participating in now happen to be 
the primary mechanism with which most teens learn about 
sexuality, learn about pregnancy, very little about 
marriage, and now homosexuality.

<p>

Those political people who are advancing a 
homosexual rights and the same-sex relationship rights 
agenda actually have very little regard for the 
developmental needs of the preteens and teenagers in our 
society, and it is very evident in these widespread sex 
education curricula which are offered to 10- all the way 
through 18-year-olds in most of the public schools 
throughout our country.  The subject of homosexuality, along 
with other topics, is included in most sex education 
curricula, more as a politically correct thing to do and not 
necessarily balanced with the cognitive, emotional, social, 
and moral needs of the children who participate, and, I 
believe, having harmful results.

<p>

As homosexuality and same-sex relationships are 
further sanctioned, these topics will be given even greater 
recognition and higher profile in sex education curricula, 
and I believe this will result in even more harm.

<p>

I am going to talk about maybe the work of the 
developmental theorists, Pieget(?), Erikson, Kohlberg(?), 
all people whose work is probably the basis of most of what 
is learned in the public education system.  But they believe 
that there are distinct differences in personality and the 
way we think and the way we socialize and even in our 
morality, and that is true among children and even adults of 
different ages.

<p>

The pattern by which each of us goes through these 
stages is an individual and interrelated and interdependent, 
basically a very complex process.  But for most of us, we 
acquire these skills, especially socialization, in a fairly 
sequential manner, and we move from one stage to the next if 
we are able to complete the tasks that are required from the 
previous stage.  If we don't complete those tasks or there 
are certain skills that are absent, it makes learning new 
behaviors or more mature behaviors a little bit harder.

<p>

Before I discuss the issue of homosexuality and 
sex education, let me give you an example of another, 
actually, a less controversial topic in sex education that 
is not consistent, let's say, with the cognitive development 
or the learning needs of preteens and teens, and that is the 
notion of including a decision-making model.

<p>

Many sex education curricula teach decision-making 
to children -- again, this 10- to 18-year-old age -- so that 
they make appropriate decisions regarding their sexual 
behavior.  They learn a model that helps them to identify a 
problem, develop a set of options to solve that problem, 
assess those options, and then eventually make a decision or 
pick one of the options that they consider to be the best.

<p>

Now, my first reaction when I looked at these 
programs -- and, I am sure, any parent's first reaction -- 
is, well, this sounds like a good thing.  You know, getting 
children to make responsible choices sounds like a great 
thing.

<p>

But when you balance that against the actual 
characteristics of these same children, you find that many 
of them are not able to think ahead, they are not able to 
assess risk, and they don't really fully consider the 
feelings of others.  Instead, as is characteristic of most 
preteens and teenagers, they are self-centered, they are 
idealistic, they are very present-oriented and impulsive.  
And the result is that these children may be able to 
memorize a decision-making model, but they are not likely to 
use it.

<p>

But the problem runs a little bit deeper than just 
using or not using this particular model.  It is a problem 
of adults expecting preteens and teenagers to act like 
adults when they should be acting like teenagers.  And as 
much as none of us like a lot of the behavior of teens, they 
are actually supposed to be self-centered, they are supposed 
to be idealistic, and they are supposed to be very grounded 
in the present.  And these characteristics actually provide 
a kind of protection for them in the process of 
experimenting with new ideas and new behaviors.

<p>

The role of parents and adults or teachers, then, 
is to provide a structure that allows teens to do this 
experimentation, to experiment, but making it consistent 
with their capabilities, but also be available to help them 
learn from this experience.

<p>

What is taught in sex education really asks the 
child or the preteenager or teenager to skip an important 
stage of development, to make critical decisions without the 
skills and guidance that are needed.  This expectation can 
and does lure many preteens and teens into high-risk 
situations that are really beyond their current 
capabilities.  Some of those risks can include pregnancy and 
now even AIDS.

<p>

Now let's turn to the topic to the homosexuality, 
which is usually addressed in a very similar manner, just 
presented, put forth out there to the same age group of 
children.  The homosexuality and, to a lesser degree now, 
same-sex relationships are actually commonly found in sex 
education curricula as a result of this growing debate about 
homosexuality.

<p>

But as that is being taught, these preteens and 
teens are entering a phase in their psychosocial development 
where it is very characteristic for these young girls to 
have a very close girlfriend or these boys to have a very 
close boyfriend.  And that is very normal.  That again is a 
stage.  That is an important developmental stage, which I 
will explain in a minute is a building block in terms of 
learning emotional intimacy and closeness.  But in these 
curriculums there is absolutely no distinction made between 
these two, I will say, events -- homosexuality and this 
normal stage of development.

<p>

All of us as children learn emotional intimacy and 
closeness starting in the family, and as we bond with 
mothers and fathers and siblings, et cetera, but as we reach 
puberty, we go outside the family and we develop these 
bonds, first with friends of our own sex; then we sort of 
move into sort of group situations with the same sex and 
then the opposite sex; and eventually, we develop a healthy 
level of intimacy that becomes an important element in 
developing romantic relationships and sexual relationships 
in marriage.

<p>

Now, if they skip a stage or experience a crisis 
in a stage, the negative aspects of that stage will 
predominate, making it difficult for them to handle the 
tasks of the next stage.

<p>

So now, what happens to preteens and teens who 
receive information about homosexuality and same-sex 
marriages at the same time they are going through this 
normal bonding with friends of the same sex, say around the 
ages of 11 to 14?  Well, what generally happens is probably 
not much harm for children who have a large support system, 
a good family and friends, and are kind of on track 
developmentally.

<p>

But for those children who are experiencing, who 
don't have a good family support, have not done well 
developmentally, either emotionally, cognitively, or 
whatever, they are more likely to be confused or seek out 
help to resolve the confusion between these two events.  
Now, that confusion can turn into fear, and that may be a 
fear that I am, indeed, a homosexual, when they are not.

<p>

Unfortunately, I have found as a social worker 
that there are very many well-meaning but misguided 
counselors out there who would actually try to engage this 
child as young as maybe 11 or 12 years old in considering 
whether they are indeed homosexual or not, engage them in 
that kind of conversation, when they are not experiencing 
any kind of sexual maturity whatsoever.

<p>

So as this debate continues about homosexuality 
and same-sex marriages and it gains more legitimacy, I 
foresee that these topics again will just gain greater 
visibility in sex education; and if it is not presented in 
the best interest of the child but rather in the best 
interest of the homosexual rights movement, there is 
potential for great harm to these children.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Press 
Conference, June 24, 1995, continues:]

<p>

MR. HEATH:  -- and the Christian Civic League of 
Maine is not proud to stand here in support of the Defense 
of Marriage Act because we wish that it were not necessary. 
But it is.  It is necessary because our Nation and our 
State, the State of Maine, is considering a radical cultural 
redefinition of marriage, and it is the obligation of all 
Christians in this Nation and in our State of Maine to stand 
publicly and to say, "This is not healthy, this is not a 
good, this is not an appropriate course upon which to 
embark."

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are presenting 
the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing.

<p>

Peter LaBarbera, executive director of Accuracy in 
Academia, talks about how the homosexual activist community 
has impacted the way schools teach our children, and he 
looks at how a pro-homosexual viewpoint is advanced.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing, Capitol Hill, 
July 2, 1996, continues:]

<p>

MR. LaBARBERA:  With all the discussion about gay 
marriage in the headlines, what is really an interesting 
thing that has been transpiring across the country is the 
rush to push pro-gay measures in the schools.  It is moving 
so far and fast that I really don't think the average parent 
with children in the schools is aware of what is going on.

<p>

Ironically, just as we are meeting here right now, 
the National Education Association is meeting across town, 
and one of the things they will be debating is reversing 
Resolution B-9, which called for the celebration of Gay and 
Lesbian History Month.  Inside word from the NEA is that 
they will repudiate B-9 because it created such a stir 
across the country when parents found out that the Education 
Association was calling for this, but it will be replaced by 
another resolution which calls for increased tolerance and 
respect for gays and lesbians.  And so we are kind of seeing 
a watered-down version of the same thing, which is the 
imposition of one moral view on homosexuality in the name of 
tolerance.

<p>

I think that what people don't realize is that the 
guy activists have a big advantage over the pro-family 
movement when it comes to education and other issues.  They 
are promoting one single, radical goal, which is the 
promotion of homosexuality, while parents and others and 
just generally even conservatives are fighting a 
multiplicity of goals, and I think studies have shown that 
when you are pushing one thing, you are concentrating 
heavily on one thing, almost like a religion, it is easier 
to push that through.  And that is what we are seeing.

<p>

There is an organization that I just learned about 
a few months ago called GLISTN.  That is the acronym.  It is 
the Gay and Lesbian and Straight Teachers Network, which 
already has, by its own claims, over 3,000 members.  The 
entire purpose of GLISTN is to campaign against homophobia 
in schools and defend openly homosexual teachers in the 
classroom.

<p>

So I think it is something that is going on.  It 
is happening rapidly, and there are a lot of suppositions 
that are being made that our parents are not aware of, and 
that is the supposition that there is such a thing as a gay 
kid, gay youth.  There's a certain percentage out there of 
kids who are gay, and now they are actually using the terms, 
also, "lesbian," "bisexual," and "transgendered."  They are 
talking about gay and lesbian and transgendered youth as if 
this is a natural identity to these kids, and they are just 
assuming it to be true.

<p>

There has been no societal debate on this.  I 
don't think there has probably been much of a debate in 
educational circles about gay identity.  And yet, all over 
the country, kids are being confirmed in homosexuality.  The 
gay activists and their allies are assuming the existence of 
gay identity, and then they are saying, "Look, we have to go 
out and we have to find these kids and we have to support 
them in the midst of this homophobic society."  You actually 
see more and more focus on eradicating homophobia at even 
the K-6 level, and there is even a call, I think by a gay 
activist group called GLAD, there has been a call to use 
children's television, PBS, to eradicate homophobia.

<p>

And so we are seeing it go earlier and earlier, 
and it is all based on this supposition of born gay.  If 
they are born gay and it's fixed, you can't change it.  
Well, then, get out there and find them and support them in 
this homophobic society.

<p>

I think that what we have to realize is that so 
much of the homosexual activist agenda is based on this 
victim concept, in this whole huge field now of promoting a 
pro-gay, a gay-affirming message in the schools.  We have 
the Gay History Month which is being debated by the NEA.  
Frequently you will have somebody like Eleanor Roosevelt, 
where there are claims on one side that she was a lesbian, 
but the students are given her name, Eleanor Roosevelt, 
without any corresponding getting the information on the 
other side.  There is a debate over this.  There are two 
sides to this debate.  And so they are told somebody like 
Eleanor Roosevelt was a homosexual; they are just told that 
as a fact. 

<p>

In the more extreme cases, they are told that 
people like St. Paul and Florence Nightingale were 
homosexual as well, as this is stated as fact.  And so this 
is highly politicized history that the students are getting.

<p>

Another strategy -- this is really promoted 
heavily by GLISTN -- is the creation of gay-straight youth 
alliances in high school.  These frequently become the 
conduits of pro-homosexual politicking and propagandizing 
within the schools.

<p>

In Massachusetts, these gay-straight alliances are 
actually getting state funding.  An incredible development 
has happened in Massachusetts.  Although there is a 
Republican governor, Governor William Weld, he is also the 
most pro-gay governor in the Nation.  He has instituted 
something called the Commission on Gay Youth, which is 
promoting this victimization strategy to the point where 
they are funding these gay-straight alliances in the 
schools.

<p>

In one instance, in Dedham High School in 
Massachusetts, a gay-straight alliance got $2,000 and they 
ended up creating -- without parents knowing anything about 
it, they created a questionnaire which was passed out to all 
students in their home rooms.  One of the questions on the 
questionnaire was, "Do you feel lesbian or gay people should 
be allowed to marry?"  So we are seeing the politicization 
through the students, and of course, students like to rebel 
and they like to do things that their parents don't like, so 
it is a natural for even the talented students to go along 
with these gay-straight alliances.

<p>

Another thing that they are doing is they are 
affirming the right of openly homosexual teachers to proudly 
affirm their identity in class.  The National Educational 
Association again has defended this very much, and we will 
see more and more of this, the right of teachers to be 
openly homosexual in the classroom.  There was actually a 
teacher who declared her classroom a safe zone for gay 
students.

<p>

And lastly, again, we see the new effort now -- 
there are whole videos out within the gay activist movement 
to combat homophobia in K-6.  So they are going all the way 
down to the preschool level to start teaching about 
homosexuality.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Press 
Conference, June 24, 1995, continues:]

<p>

MR. BARBEE:  There is just a plethora of economic
impacts that haven't been talked about hardly at all. For
example, within just federal law, within the law and the
regulations, there are over 800 sections that refer to
marriage.  With the word "spouse," there are over 3,100
references to the word "spouse" within federal law.

<p>

Now, within the beltway mentality, that tends to 
be thinking that that is all of it.  It's not all of it.
There are 50 other states that also have laws and
regulations and local governments that have ordinances that 
state and have to do with the rights that proceed from the 
definition of marriage and family and the word "spouse."

<p>

These would all be set in disarray.  Can you 
imagine the number of court cases, lawsuits, that would 
arise out of this, and the impact on businesses all across 
this country?

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We will now hear from Mary 
Beth Style, a social worker who is a former vice president 
of the National Council for Adoption.  Mary Beth's 
experience with the world of adoption is crucial to 
understanding why pairs of women or men do not trump a 
married mom and dad.

<p>

[Segment from July 2, 1996, Defense of Marriage 
Capitol Hill Briefing continues:]

<p>

MS. STYLE:  Whenever I talk about adoption, I like 
to start with reminding people what adoption is all about.  
Adoption is all about children.  It is all about the best 
interests of children and meeting the needs of children, 
creating families for children, replicating the biological 
families that children would have when their own biological 
families cannot or will not raise them.

<p>

As such, we make sure at this point that children 
have a mother and a father, which is why we terminate the 
biological parents' rights.  It is not foster care, it is 
not guardianship where biological parents retain rights and 
a child may have two mothers or two fathers.  It is adoption 
in which you have one set of parents.

<p>

One of the things that we do see is that in the 
states were adoption law occurs, there is a lot of variation 
when you are looking at time frames of when you can sign 
consents, when you can revoke consents, when you can 
overturn an adoption and things like that.  But the one 
thing that everybody is unanimous about is that an adoption 
cannot occur unless it is proven to be in the best interest 
of the child.

<p>

So one of the things that has concerned me about 
people who are trying to reform adoption laws, as they say, 
whether we are talking about gay rights or any other thing, 
is that we stop talking about children all of a sudden and 
we start talking about the rights of parents or of adults 
and the needs of adults that want to adopt, as if we can 
create a right to adopt.

<p>

There is no right to adopt, and I think we need to 
look at that rights language, because if you have a right to 
adopt, then you have a guarantee to adopt, and the state 
would have to guarantee you a child. Now, it is absurd.
It is absurd on its face, and I think we need to remember 
that.

<p>

A judge cannot grant an adoption unless it is 
shown to him that it is in the best interest of the child.
Now, there may be some differences of opinion on what is in 
the best interest of a particular child, but it still has to 
go back to that child.  Placement decisions have to be made 
on the child, and I think we need to keep that in mind.

<p>

Currently, the states do not generally say who can 
and cannot adopt, with a few exceptions where they may have 
that people with a history of abuse or are criminals, 
felons, cannot adopt.  And I am not sure I want to put on 
the books who can and cannot adopt.  Now, we do have two 
states, New Hampshire and Florida, which say that 
homosexuals cannot adopt.

<p>

I think we need to leave that open to the 
practice, because I think you need to look at each 
individual case to determine what is in the best interest of 
the child.  In most states currently -- now, we do have some 
case law that is changing this -- is that a married couple 
or a single person can adopt, but two single persons cannot 
adopt the same child.

<p>

The reason for that -- and I think that that is a 
sound policy -- is that the state believes that in order for 
two adults to parent a child, they have to have a legal 
commitment to each other.  You cannot form a family through 
a child.  The family has to be there and the child comes 
into it.

<p>

And so one of the things that we have seen is that 
the Court of Appeals in New York has just granted a 
homosexual couple and an unmarried heterosexual couple the 
right to adopt, which is a first time that that has 
happened.  Well, it is not the first time it has happened, 
but it is an exception to the rule.

<p>

One of the more celebrated cases we had where we 
had two unmarried people adopting was Woody Allen and Mia 
Farrow, and they had gotten a special exemption from a 
particular court, and we have seen the disaster of that.
Now, obviously, not all will end up like that, but it is 
important to recognize that there is a legal family, a 
committed family there, before a child goes into it.

<p>

We also, I think, don't want to allow people who 
are making placement decisions to be arbitrary in their 
decision making, but I think that we need to look at that as 
far as what is in the best interest of the child.  People 
will argue that a policy by an agency which says that an 
individual over 60 cannot adopt is arbitrary and that that 
should not happen.

<p>

But we have to remember that in adoption, we are 
responsible for the child; we are going to stack the deck 
for the child, so that while we cannot guarantee that a 35-
year-old is not going to get hit by a car, the odds are that 
there is more chance for a 35-year-old to still be around 
for that child to reach the age of maturity than for a 60-
year-old adopting that child.  And so there are some 
policies that can be discriminating in selecting individual 
families that we need to keep in place because, again, there 
is no right to adopt but there is a right for a child to 
have the best opportunity to a family.

<p>

Now, I think as far as the issue of gays and 
lesbians that we have plenty of evidence that children do 
better in a two-parent family which is a mother and a 
father.  There has been a lot of emphasis in the last year 
or so on what happens to kids without fathers.  We haven't 
paid as much attention about what happens to kids without 
mothers, but I think that all of us can understand what that 
would be.

<p>

And it is not a matter of quantity.  It is not a 
matter of two parents, because children that are raised by a 
grandmother and a mother are not doing as well as the kids 
who have a mother and a father.  Kids needs mothers and 
fathers, and I think that as we develop adoption policies, 
we have to keep children in mind rather than being concerned 
about the needs and wants of adults.  Kids don't care about 
being politically correct; they just want a mommy and a 
daddy.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  It has been mentioned here today that 
one of the things that we are most concerned with is our 
children.  Everyone always is concerned about the next 
generation that is coming along; what are we going to teach 
our children?  And quite frankly, as this legislation moved 
through North Carolina and we heard from, in both houses in 
the committee meetings, a number of homosexual activists, 
particularly from several lesbians who talked about raising 
children in their families and how some of their children 
were becoming homosexuals and some of their children, a few 
of them, were not, it really did a lot to let legislators 
understand that this is a critical issue; that in fact who 
raises these children is an important part of where we going 
to be down the road.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

We now bring you some intriguing questions from 
those who attended the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
and the answers, not often heard beyond a quick sound bite, 
from the experts who spoke.

<p>

[Segment from July 2, 1996, Defense of Marriage Briefing continues:]

<p>

QUESTION: Dr. Satinover, when you were talking
about the evidence that is there stating what you had (said)
in your opening statement, what do you see as the primary
barrier for getting that evidence to mainstream America?
You mentioned the media.  Is it more than just the media?
And if it is the media, what does it have to gain by
precluding that evidence?

<p>

DR. SATINOVER: I think probably the major reason 
that that evidence doesn't get out there is because of the 
tremendous reservoir of sympathy and good will that most 
Americans harbor for people who are in any kind of trouble 
and who are put upon.

<p>

The truth of the matter is that homosexuality 
afflicts a very small minority of the population.
Obviously, that figure itself has been the subject of some 
dispute.  Probably 3 percent is a good scientific, 
replicable percentage.  And there is no question that 
homosexuals suffer tremendous emotional distress both in 
their early personal lives and also in the way that they are 
frequently treated by others.

<p>

When they began to organize as a group and made a 
plea for sympathy, I think most people felt that, yes, that 
is right, we owe it to them.  And it became very, very
difficult, as the whole picture began to change and
determined efforts were made to paint a portrait of the
scientific evidence that was different than the truth, it
really became very difficult for people to be motivated to
take the time and trouble and argue against it. The
majority of people really didn't care about it. It didn't
affect them, and so why make trouble?

<p>

And the truth is that you can get into a 
considerable amount of difficulty by crossing gay activism, 
especially within the professions.  They have made an 
attempt within the American Psychiatric Association to make 
it an ethical violation for a psychiatrist to help treat a 
homosexual who wishes to change, even if that is what the 
person himself wants.  So a lot of people have been 
basically intimidated into just walking away from it.

<p>

However, it has gone too far, and in my view, the 
real problem that we need to look at is not so much gay 
activism as it is the very, very large number of people who 
wish to leave homosexuality.  The relationship -- there is a 
strong correlation between broken families and the next 
generation's incidence of homosexuality.  We are witnessing 
now the problems that began in this society 20, 30, 40 years 
ago, and there are a tremendous number of people out there 
who need our help, and it absolutely will do no good 
whatsoever for us to say, "This problem doesn't really touch 
me.  I'm just going to deal with it on a political level.
Let 'them' have what they want."  Because that will teach 
the younger rising generation precisely the wrong lesson.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Gay political activists say that 
they are really for exclusions in discrimination concerning 
the churches in America, the temples and churches in 
America.  But if gay marriage is accepted into the civil 
government in America, what would stop the gay political 
activists from coming up now to the church level and saying, 
"Hey, you know, it's accepted in the civil government, and 
unless you accept active homosexuals into the churches, then 
we are going to withdraw your 501(c)(3) status, your tax-exempt 
status"?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, I think that is a very real 
threat.  A lot of the gay activists have said, "Look, we'll 
allow ministers to perform the usual type of wedding and to 
bar homosexual weddings."  I think what they are leaving out 
is, "for now."  Because once you are outside the civil law, 
once the churches' rules are said to be immoral, because the 
law says they are wrong, this situation cannot hold for very 
long.  We have seen other situations in which religious 
exemptions once granted were taken away once the government 
felt there was a compelling interest to do so.

<p>

I can foresee a time when there will be -- if all 
these gay rights laws are in place, and some churches 
perform same-sex weddings -- that the ones that do not will 
be seen as suspect, as churches themselves, and we may find 
ourselves in the situation that the people of the Soviet 
Union were in where these churches might be allowed to 
perform their own ceremonies and have services behind closed 
doors but have no public life at all.  They will be 
outcasts.

<p>

So when you put gay rights into the law, you are 
slowly and surely ghettoizing the churches and saying that 
you're no longer part of the civil code here.  That's very 
dangerous.

<p>

QUESTION: I think it was you that mentioned that 
most gay activists don't really intend to harm the family.
Mr. Knight, you were using words like "tyranny" and "aiming
to achieve raw power."  Is there any way to assess if there 
is an aim or a goal of this body?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  We may disagree.  I think they are 
out to harm the family based on their own statements.
Michelangelo Signorelli(?) is not alone.  Paula 
Edelbrich(?), who is legal director of Lambda Legal Defense 
Fund, which is bringing many of these cases, is not even a 
fan of marriage because she said it isn't radical enough.
"We want to completely, radically alter the institution of 
the family."  And other activists have said so.

<p>

I am not saying that homosexuals feel that way; I 
am saying homosexual activists are aiming at that. A lot of 
homosexuals are sitting on the sidelines just saying, "Leave 
me alone.  I don't want to get involved in this."  That's 
not who I am talking about.  I am talking about the activist 
movement here.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I think it is very important to 
point out that most homosexuals are not activists.  I was in 
that myself for nine years, and many of us were not really 
involved.  The homosexual activists seem to be speaking for 
the majority of homosexuals.  Most homosexuals don't even 
want to be associated with the political movement in this 
country.  I don't think it is more than 5 percent of the 
homosexual population in this country that are connected to 
the gay political movement, and I think that needs to be 
addressed.

<p>

[Segment from June 24, 1995, press conference continues:]

<p>

MR. ZANOTTI:  If we liken marriage to a kite in 
the wind, we could observe that over recent generations the 
string that holds it in the sky has been fraying.  Sometimes 
the kite doesn't look that good up there.  Sometimes it is 
not as shiny and as brilliant as we once thought it was, and 
we wonder how far it can eventually travel, if our culture 
does not deal with this issue today, if we do not pass DOMA, 
if we do not hear the cries from across the Nation, of state 
after state after state, if we permit marriage to be 
redefined according to the proponents of same-sex marriage 
who define it accordingly.  It is best understood as a 
relationship of financial interdependence between two people 
who make a public commitment.  If this happens, we will cut 
the string of marriage forever, and our culture will drift 
off with no control.

<p>

Mark the hour.  It's somewhere around 10:17.  Mark 
the day.  This is the 24th of June.  In 16 years in the 
public policy business, we have taken quite a practice to 
studying history.  If you are a student of history, you will 
have noticed the different dialects, the different 
geography, the different approaches, and it will sound a lot 
like debates that have happened before in this Nation, and I 
would caution you to note this day in history, because this 
is the kind of debate that rents the soul of a nation.  It 
rips the soul of a nation; it tears it.  This is the kind of 
debate that gets out of hand.

<p>

"These are the times that try men's souls," has 
been once before stated in our culture.  Mark the hour and 
mark the day, because this sounds like places our Nation has 
been before, places that have cost huge human sacrifices in 
life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are discussing what once
was the foundation of families and cultures: marriage.

<p>

Unfortunately, the institution of marriage battles 
daily for the esteem it once held, and the reasons for this 
erosion range from the breakdown in values to the laws which 
allow individuals to hastily rid themselves of a difficult 
situation.

<p>

Is it possible to have both love and marriage?
We'll be talking to columnist and author Maggie Gallagher, 
whose most recent book, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>, takes 
a look at why marriage is collapsing and some ways to rebuild 
cherished lifelong relationships.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council.  Gary takes an analytical 
look at the approaching elections and the strategy political 
parties are employing.  It has already been an interesting 
road to election day.

<p>

So let's hear from Gary to see what he foresees 
for the journey ahead as Straight Talk takes you Behind the 
Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

You know, there has been a lot of conversation 
lately by media and political analysts about the way in 
which the Republicans are playing their hand versus the way 
the Democratic Party is playing its hand.

<p>

You've got Bill Clinton with the issue of the week 
and Bob Dole saying, you know, "Look, I'm going to bring my 
strategy out later."  You've got the Democrats on the Hill 
bringing forward new legislation even in the ninth hour of 
the legislative session, and the Republicans sort of trying 
to clean up old business and doing a lot of behind-the-scenes, 
quiet negotiating that we're not hearing about.  Do you think 
this is an effective strategy?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think the Republican Party has 
a problem right now.  I think a lot of folks around the 
country are really hoping that they'll get a little bit more 
aggressive in putting the program out for the American 
people to examine.

<p>

It's kind of ironic, because I think most 
Americans are close or closer to where the Republican Party 
is on these issues, whether it's lowering taxes, smaller 
government, traditional values, or whatever.  The polling 
data is pretty overwhelming.  And so it's sort of ironic 
that the party seems to not be able to find its legs right 
now to be promoting those things.

<p>

I would love to see and hope that Bob Dole, for 
example, will emphasize in the weeks ahead the need for 
massive tax cuts.  The American people want tax cuts.  It 
will get the economy moving strongly, which is what we all 
want.  And yet the issue seems to not exist right now 
because the party hasn't brought it up.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Tax cuts are a great example.  As 
you know, Bill Clinton talked about the middle-class tax 
cut, and one never appeared; and the Republicans, in their 
Contract with America, said, "Look, we're going to go for a 
$500-per-child tax cut," and there's a lot of quiet again 
behind the scenes negotiating.  Maybe it will be on one 
appropriations bill, maybe another.

<p>

And yet Bill Clinton, who has raised taxes, is 
talking a lot about tax cuts; Bob Dole again saying very 
little.  What's the problem here?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Yes, this is really bizarre.  I saw a 
poll the other day that just was unbelievable to me.  It 
asked the question, "Who do you think is most likely to 
lower your taxes?"  And Bob Dole and Bill Clinton were 
basically tied on that question.  Now, this is absurd.  Bill 
Clinton put through one of the most massive tax increases in 
the history of the country right at the beginning of his 
administration.  As you just alluded to, he promised a 
middle-class tax cut which never materialized.

<p>

Senator Dole has advocated tax relief for years.  
And yet to the general public, the two candidates right now 
are indistinguishable.

<p>

I think that kind of a poll ought to be a reminder 
to the Republican National Committee that you cannot assume 
that people out of Washington understand these differences. 
We've got to remind them every day.  And certainly Senator 
Dole and the Republican Party need to remind the American 
people every day that they're the party of lower taxes and 
tax relief.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like Bill Clinton has taken 
a page out of Newt Gingrich's playbook with his issues of 
the week, and Newt had, of course, the Contract with 
America, talking about this is what I'm running on; Bill 
Clinton bringing forward his own agenda items.  Do you find 
some irony there?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, yes, there is a lot of irony 
there. In fact, Senator Dole, I think, suggested the other 
day that maybe Bill Clinton just ought to get a big sign 
that says "Me, too," and then every time Senator Dole takes 
a position, Clinton could stand up and hold up the sign. I 
think the point that Senator Dole was trying to make is that 
the President has been co-opting many of these issues.

<p>

There's an interesting thing here to notice.  The 
issues that the President is going out on are not really 
federal issues.  In the last couple of weeks, we have had 
the President say he is for school uniforms.  We've had them 
introduce a federal initiative on school truancy.  I mean, 
however much one might be happy that the President is saying 
these things, they have almost nothing to do with 
Washington, D.C.

<p>

Truancy, the problem of school truancy, is a 
problem for local school districts.  The decision of whether 
students will wear uniforms to class or not is a decision 
for local school districts to make.

<p>

But the President is very astute.  By taking a 
stand on these positions, he sends a message to voters that, 
culturally, he is traditional, the way they are.  And he 
avoids needing to do anything about these matters because 
they really aren't Washington or Presidential issues.  

<p>

So he gets the advantage of talking about them 
without really having to take any sort of action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It would seem as though the 
Republicans are keeping their powder dry for some future 
date.  Would that be your advice to them?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, my good friend George Bush kept 
his powder dry for what appears in retrospect to have been 
an entire campaign, and unfortunately, instead of getting 
reelected, he ended up losing to Bill Clinton.

<p>

I have never understood what happened during that 
campaign.  George Bush was and is a good and decent man.  He 
had a great program he could have run on, and it just never 
seemed to get explained to the American people.  I hope that 
Bob Dole is not going to make the same mistake this year.

<p>

Bill Clinton is an incredible campaigner.  You've 
got to take your hat off to him.  He really makes his case 
and does it well.  I don't think they should wait till the 
convention.  I don't think they should wait till Labor Day, 
which some advisers are [suggesting].  I think the campaign 
is going on now and that Bob Dole needs to outline his 
vision for the future of the country and how to take the 
American people into the next century.

<p>

You have to say the things you are for, the things 
you believe in, and you've got to do it over and over and 
over again.  It's like telling your wife you love her.  You 
can't say it too many times.  It takes that to get through 
all the din and noise that the American people are subjected 
to.

<p>

So I would urge Bob Dole and the Republican Party 
every day to bring up taxes, to bring up the need for 
smaller government, to bring up the need for a strong 
defense, to bring up traditional values, family issues, and 
to do that right through the campaign, through the summer, 
through the conventions, through the campaign, and begin to 
explain to the American people the differences between that 
party and the party that Bill Clinton heads up, which tends 
to believe in higher taxes, big government, more regulation, 
and so forth.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of Clinton's advisors said that 
the way that you know what America really understands and 
talks about in terms of a campaign is by watching the late 
shows; Jay Leno and David Letterman are an indicator of what 
people understand about politics.  And we've heard a lot 
lately about seances and Hillary Clinton talking with 
Eleanor Roosevelt, and it has been quite a big joke.  And 
yet the Clinton White House struck back very quickly, 
saying, "Look, other people have done it.  Nancy Reagan has 
done it.  Jackie Kennedy talked with Lincoln," something 
that I don't think most people had ever heard before.  Do 
you think that that is an effective way of dealing with it?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know the old saying, the 
best defense is a strong offense.  The Clinton team really 
nailed this down four years ago, again in the Bush campaign.  
They formed a quick-response team whose job it was to 
literally respond within hours of any Republican attack, and 
they did that consistently through the campaign.  If George 
Bush made a point in the morning, by the time the evening 
news played that night, there was a response from James 
Carville and Stephanopoulos and the other wordsmiths around 
the President.

<p>

They are doing the same thing now, and it is very 
effective.  Again, I think my Republican friends could take 
a page out of this handbook and realize that no charge 
against Bob Dole ought to be allowed to linger for days 
without somebody in the party responding to it.  We are 
living in a media age where the attention span is very 
short.  Stories come and go literally within a matter of 
hours, and I think it is very important for the Republicans 
to be just as quick on the response as the Clinton White 
House is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Lately there has been some analysis 
by conservative media critics talking about the incredible 
barrier that a Republican has to overcome in terms of 
getting any kind of positive echo from the media, while a 
Democratic candidate or official really does have a 
resonance with the media on a lot of issues.

<p>

David Fromme(?) from <i>The Weekly Standard</i> said 
lately, "Well, sure, the President gets some negative press. 
But wouldn't anybody if they were accused of womanizing and 
skirt-chasing and bad loan deals and campaign finance 
problems?  I mean, how much do you have to go through before 
you get a couple of bad press stories?"

<p>

But do you think that these character issues are 
going to have a negative effect?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, first, let me address the 
question about the media.  This city is still talking about 
a study that was done earlier in the summer that showed that 
only 4 percent of Washington-based reporters said that they 
were registered Republicans.  Now, are we really to believe 
that that has no impact on the way the news is reported?  It 
has to have an impact.  People are normal human beings.  
Their biases, their prejudices inevitably are going to seep 
into the coverage.  So Republicans and conservatives do have 
a higher bar to jump, and it is something that they are 
going to have to deal with for years into the future.

<p>

The character issue is a troubling one because, as 
you indicated, there are certainly a lot of character 
problems evident in the Clinton Administration.  I was 
talking to Senator Nickles the other day after he had just 
come off the floor of the Senate, where he was attempting to 
summarize in a half-hour, in a floor speech in the Senate, 
those character issues, and he said, "Gary, the half-hour 
was over and I hadn't gotten through half of them."  And he 
could not think of any recent administration, certainly any 
administration in the 20th century, that had this many 
character issues or values-related issues to deal with.

<p>

Will it make a difference on election day?  I 
don't know.  I certainly think character issues and value 
issues can weaken the standing of the President.  But I 
think, at the end of the day, probably, unfortunately, 
Americans go into the voting booth and vote on who they 
think has a vision for the future.  I think they are 
troubled by scandal, they are troubled by somebody that 
might have engaged in inappropriate activities.  But at the 
end of the day, they want to know which candidate is going 
to build an America that is going to be better for them, 
their jobs, their children, their families.

<p>

And so while I would encourage the Republicans to 
keep talking about character, I don't think, when the 
election is over, that that will be a substitute for putting 
forth a coherent vision of how you want to govern the 
country and what you hope for the American people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Democratic Party -- and Bill 
Clinton in particular -- has very much pursued alternative 
media strategies.  They have gone to MTV, they have done the 
late shows, they have looked at where the counterculture is. 
The Republicans, on the whole, have stayed with a more 
traditional approach, doing network television advertising, 
sticking with the weekend news analysis shows, much more 
standard in their approach.

<p>

Do you think that the Republicans would benefit 
from pursuing an alternative media strategy?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think they need to be aware 
that there are obviously a lot more choices now for the 
American people than there used to be in the media, and 
you've got to get beyond just the three major networks.  But 
I wouldn't advise them to do what Clinton did in the early 
years of his Presidency and during the 1992 campaign, where 
he went on MTV and answered questions about what kind of 
underwear he wore and went on stage with Al Gore as the 
blues brothers, and so forth.

<p>

You will notice that in the last couple of years 
you don't see that anymore, that in fact the President tries 
to act Presidential, which is a good thing for a President 
to do.

<p>

I would not try to kowtow to the cultural values 
of MTV.  I would use MTV for regular ads to present the 
Republican message and the conservative message.  But I 
don't think you've got to do the sorts of things that Bill 
Clinton did that I thought were, quite frankly, rather 
embarrassing for a President of the United States.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the day, Gary, what do 
you think will determine who our next President will be?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, this is really a very 
basic issue.  Every public opinion poll shows that America 
is basically a conservative country.  We just saw a study in 
the last couple of weeks where literally 20 issues were 
outlined, and I believe on 17 of the 20 the American people 
came down on the conservative side.

<p>

That being the case, the most conservative 
candidate ought to win the election, and there is absolutely 
no doubt to anyone in this city that Bob Dole is the 
conservative candidate and that Bill Clinton is the liberal 
candidate.  Around the country, however, the public, the 
voter, seems confused about that.

<p>

So I think the election will rise and fall on who 
is able to make the articulate case for conservative values. 
That ought to be Bob Dole, and I hope that he will meet that 
challenge and outline that vision.  If he doesn't do that, 
then I think the American people, out of confusion, may in 
fact reelect the President.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you, Gary, so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
introduce you to a nationally known author, Maggie 
Gallagher, who discusses her book, <i>The Abolition of 
Marriage</i>, and provides key insight into what has caused the 
marriage foundation to crumble.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from the Heritage Foundation's "The Collape of 
Marriage" Panel Discussion held May 15, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. ADAM MEYERSON: The collapse of marriage is 
the number one cause of poverty in this country.  It's the 
number one cause of crime.  It's a major cause of suicide.  
It's a major cause of our educational breakdown.  The 
collapse of marriage also threatens the very future of 
democracy.

<p>

Our republic is based on the self-evident truth 
that all men and women are endowed by our Creator with the 
right to pursue happiness.  Do we have that right if our 
most important institution for providing happiness is 
crumbling before our eyes?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  I really don't believe that we are 
going to be a society characterized by faith, hope, 
optimism, and upward mobility if we live in a society in 
which marriage, as it is rapidly becoming, ceases to be the 
normal way in which we raise children.

<p>

The giving of yourself in a lifelong commitment to 
another human being is the most extraordinary thing most of 
us will ever do.  With the abolition of marriage, that last 
possibility for heroism is being taken from us.

<p>

[End of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We saw a bit of Maggie's insight 
regarding marriage and the struggles men and women face 
today.  But now let's meet the woman of the hour, Maggie 
Gallagher, a syndicated columnist whose most recent book, 
<i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>, has received acclaim in 
publications across the country.

<p>

Maggie, thanks so much for being with us today.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And I want to hold this up, <i>The 
Abolition of Marriage</i>. We are going to be certainly talking 
about it throughout the hour.

<p>

I think what is interesting to me about it is the 
subtext, "How We Destroy Lasting Love," because I think the 
idea is that Cinderella, throughout all the great women of 
mythological American history, that somehow you find your 
love and you have your love, and then they lived happily 
ever after.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, and it is also about, too 
often, the divorce culture that we live in is portrayed as a 
great good, you know, that we are freer, we are better off, 
we are happier.  And I don't really think so.  I don't think 
that the kind of culture that we are building, that a 
society where your spouse is no longer trustworthy, that we 
can't really count on those marriage bonds for something so 
basic as helping us raise our children, I don't think that 
women, in particular, are freer or better off, and I think 
that we are losing something very precious.  It's a false 
gain.  We're not really more free, but what we are is much 
more anxious, and we have much less faith in the possibility 
of lasting love, and that is what I really wanted to get 
into with this book.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that the culture of 
divorce itself is a self-fulfilling prophecy?  Divorces 
happen, divorce is easy, divorce could happen to me; 
therefore, maybe my marriage isn't good?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  Yes, I do.  I think we're on a 
downward spiral.  I don't think that, by itself, the 
situation will turn around.  You see this in kind of social 
science research that shows that children of divorce are 
both more likely to divorce, themselves, and more likely to 
become unwed parents.  And it is very obvious when you talk 
to these kids why that is true.

<p>

A society which tells people, and tells women in 
particular, that they have a right to be a single parent 
through divorce is going to have a hard time telling the 
next generation that it's important to be married before you 
have children or that a father is a very important part of 
the family, if they didn't have a father as part of their 
family.

<p>

And what everyone experiences, whether they have 
ever divorced or their parents ever divorced or not, is a 
much higher level of anxiety and fear of betrayal.  You 
know, if you do trust your spouse, there's a part of you 
that always ends up wondering, Am I being a fool?  And there 
a lot of people out there telling you that you are a fool if 
you depend on your husband or your wife in any way, because 
the message we're getting is you can't count on anyone, and 
that's not a recipe for a healthy society or a happy person.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think that is a really interesting 
point, being married now almost four years myself.  When my 
husband and I first got married, you would think that people 
would be congratulating you and be very excited about your 
marriage.  And yet I would have to say that the most 
consistent message is, "Now you're going to have problems.  
You think you're happy now.  Give yourself six months, give 
yourself a year."  And since we have made it four years, and 
I would have to say that it has been better every year, I 
guess I don't know when the magic now comes.

<p>

But I was very fascinated by that, about the 
negative way in which everyone encourages you to get married 
and then, on the brink of engagement and married life, tells 
you, "Ah, you're going to have real problems."

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I think probably even more common 
on the part of the watchers, anyway, if not the 
participants, instead of any person's marriage being a kind 
of reaffirmation, this one moment where we watch something 
extraordinary happen -- two people become one -- there is 
this kind of subtext which is always, well, is this going to 
last?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  You know, here we are; we're going 
to give the gifts; we're going to rearrange all our 
relationships.  But is it all going to fall apart or not?

<p>

I do think what you say about happiness, 
everything we know is that marriage is very important for 
people's happiness; that people who don't marry or who are 
divorced as a group are not, by their own accounts, very 
happy people.  They have many more problems, health 
problems, both serious and those that are related to stress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  You know, having a person in your 
life that you can count on, that kind of commitment, which 
is the marriage bond, is very important, and we are made to 
be -- not all of us will marry, but we were really clearly, 
the two sexes were made for each other and made for the kind 
of relationship that marriage contains.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  One thing I wanted to ask you, in 
particular, was certainly almost every culture has come from 
a setting in which marriages were arranged, in which 
marriage was not, per se, a romantic adventure, but it had 
the potential to become that, and many people -- actually, 
as a matter of fact, I had an interesting conversation with 
a cabbie on a very long ride not too long ago, telling me 
about how much he loves his wife, whom he met on the day of 
his wedding, and they are from Pakistan.

<p>

What I wanted to ask you was, if you look at that 
historical perspective in which so many marriages have not 
arisen out of romantic candlelight dinners and have a much 
more lasting quality than marriages in America today, why do 
you think, even from our own history -- are these women 
afraid to divorce, or is there something really different 
about marriages in some other cultural contexts?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I think there is a difference.  I 
want to say, first of all, that we should not underestimate 
how unique the Christian/Western tradition is, and in fact, 
the idea of the consent of the bride, the idea of connecting 
love and marriage, is actually quite old in our own culture, 
and certainly for as long as America has existed, people 
have been making what they saw as love matches, even though 
they may not have placed as much attention to some of the 
romantic frou-frou in those days.

<p>

But I do think there is something important to be 
learned from that.  We tend to think that as marriage 
collapses and we get this high divorce rate that the answer 
is just -- some people say, Make marriage harder, and the 
idea is, just look really, really carefully for the exact 
right person.  And the fact that arranged marriages work so 
well is a hint to me that how you love after you are married 
is probably more important to the success of your marriage 
than finding someone whose personality exactly fits yours, 
because the reality is, even if you found that perfect match 
at the moment that you married, life changes and people 
change, and if your marriage is going to last, it has to 
come from some kind of commitment to that whole person.

<p>

And the other thing about that is that our 
mentality is very consumerist.  It is like, who is exactly 
the right person for me?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And for marriage to work, both 
people have to be at least equally and hopefully more 
concerned with how can I be the right person for my spouse; 
how do I love this person well?

<p>

I think that that kind of image of marriage, 
recognition that it is not really about our own internal 
feelings, it is about a real other person that we are 
willing to commit to, to care for and take care of in the 
ways that husbands and wives do, is part of what we need to 
recapture more fully.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think Hollywood certainly 
contributes to that flavor-of-the-month mentality about 
marriage:  Well, I am sure another good wife is coming along 
any moment.

<p>

But I want to talk more about how we love after 
marriage when we come back.  And when we come back, we will 
hear more from Maggie and the reasons why marriage seems to 
be crumbling.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are continuing 
our discussion about marriage and, most importantly, what 
makes a successful marriage, with Maggie Gallagher, author 
of Enemies of Eros(?), and her most recent book, <i>The 
Abolition of Marriage</i>. Welcome back, Maggie.

<p>

We were talking before the break about how people 
do love after marriage, and it seems so many books talk 
about, especially, you know, even bag(?) books for a second, 
because people aren't always as good readers as we wish, but 
you've got Cosmopolitan and El Magazine and everybody 
telling you, if you have sex in this way or you have this 
kind of food or whatever, that you're going to catch the 
right man, but not a lot of conversation about what do you 
do once you have this man.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I am also struck particularly in 
the messages that have been sent to women and what I call 
women's culture, and you are talking about things from Oprah 
and the whole set of daytime shows to People magazine and 
the women's magazines, and for many years they have been 
very, perhaps unconsciously, anti-marriage.

<p>

You look at how many -- go to your supermarket 
sometime and just think about how many covers of People 
magazine in the last -- that you have seen have been about, 
I'm 40, I dumped the geek, I'm free, I'm happy, right?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And the message that you're 
sending women there is that if you haven't dumped the geek 
and you're still staying in a struggling marriage, there 
must be something wrong with you.  Obviously, the first 
thing you need to do to be happy is to get rid of your 
husband.

<p>

I think that there has a little bit of a turn more 
towards marriage as we see how difficult divorced life can 
be for women, particularly women with children, and for men, 
too, for that matter.  But still there has been directed 
particularly at women, I think, a lot of very hostile 
messages.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You know, what is funny about that 
is at Family Research Council I certainly field hundreds of 
media calls sometimes even in a day, and one of the things 
that has come up as there has been sort of a reemergence of 
marriage is, don't I think that the culture of AIDS has 
really encouraged the reemergence of marriage?  Everyone is 
afraid to get a deadly disease, so they're going to make it 
work.

<p>

But, you know, I don't agree, and I am interested 
in your reaction to this.  I think marriage has reemerged 
because so many people recognize that divorce is not the 
easy answer that it has been made to be, that you can be 
very unhappy and realize that that husband or wife wasn't so 
bad.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: You know, I think that AIDS gave 
some well-educated women who perhaps weren't religious an 
acceptable reason to say no, which they were dying for, but 
it isn't the prime impetus.  It is partly the ongoing 
research literature, which now shows very clearly that 
divorce is very harmful for children, on average; that you 
have two to three times the risk of a whole host of things, 
from psychological disorders, education failures, risk of 
becoming a criminal; and that when you follow these kids to 
adult life, they are, on average, less happy.  They are less 
successful and they are less happy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they are very much more 
stressed.  There is a lot of uneasiness.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes, and we have come to this 
theory that you have just a short crisis and then kids 
adjust and it doesn't really matter whether they have both 
of their parents cooperating and raising them together in a 
married family or not.  I mean, that was a lot happy talk 
which has nothing to do with reality.

<p>

I think that the research confirmation, the expert 
opinion, but really, what you are talking about is people's 
experience.  I mean, we all now have been living in this 
culture for 30 years.  Those happy myths about how divorce 
is better for the kids, et cetera, et cetera, if I am happy, 
my kids will be happy -- we know how hard it is when 
marriage breaks up on both the adults and especially on the 
children, and we are looking for answers.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to ask you -- and I 
will throw out some of my own -- what you consider to be 
some of the worst myths about marriage right now.  I think, 
from my perspective with a lot of friends at the beginning 
of their marriages, I think one of the worst myths is that, 
having gotten married, you have finished something, when I 
don't think you have finished anything.  You have begun 
something, and making your marriage is a constant renewal.  
You know, having gotten my job, I am not done.  I am 
actually expected to go and accomplish something.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: There are very few novels that are 
about being married; they are mostly about getting a 
spouse --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, they are.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: -- a husband or a wife, and 
living happily ever after.  Yes, I think there is something 
to that, and it feeds into, again -- the way I think about 
this, Kristi, is marriage basically a creative or productive 
institution or act, or is it a consumption item?  I think it 
is what we produce in life that makes us happy and that it 
is important to recognize that what we're doing when we're 
getting married is building something.  We are making 
something, a relationship with our spouse and a new family 
in most cases; and that in the long run it is our success at 
achieving that, at making that, which is going to make us 
happy, even if we're not happy all the time in the middle of 
that; and that, if we turn around and say, well, "Am I being 
made happy enough to stay married?" what you have done is 
turned your spouse from your principal responsibility, your 
vocation in life, to being just a thing, an object that you 
use up, and if you are not getting what you want, you trade 
them in.

<p>

That is very destructive to love.  It is a habit 
of the heart which is very destructive to both human 
happiness, human virtue, and the ability to love.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How important is marriage to children? 
You see a lot of conversation today in many contexts, 
whether it be homosexual marriage discussions or 
cohabiting people talking, that if you have one or two or 
three loving people, you know, as long as there is love, 
that children are okay.  But how important is marriage to 
children?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: There have been so experiments in 
the last couple of hundred years, really, with alternate 
family forms, and they all end up dissolving at sort of even 
greater rates than marriage, whatever its imperfections.

<p>

Marriage is key.  It's the way we give children fathers. It's 
the way we teach children that the family is important, that 
family relationships can be counted on. Every person -- and 
I know there are tragic situations where a divorce or a 
separation is necessary -- but every time you divorce as a 
parent, one message you are sending your children is that 
family relationships can appear and disappear, you can be 
related and unrelated, and that in some way, then, love is not 
reliable.

<p>

That message, even if your child doesn't become a 
drug user or depressed or a juvenile delinquent and gets 
good grades and goes to a good college, when you talk to 
children of divorce, that comes out very, very powerfully.  
When they go to love, to marry, to form families, they carry 
with them this enormous burden of fear of betrayal, because 
the lesson their life taught them is that love is not 
reliable, and that is a very hard less to teach a child.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would think that the social 
repercussions of that are going to affect us for many years, 
and I would like to ask you a little bit more about that in 
just a moment.

<p>

Please stay tuned for more words of wisdom 
regarding marriage, divorce, and love from Maggie Gallagher 
when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once 
again Maggie Gallagher, who is sharing her research and 
insights from her latest book, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>. 
Welcome back, Maggie.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We were talking before the break 
about people carrying into marriage, children of divorce, 
even if they have managed to successfully complete school, 
this sense of I don't know what is going to last, what ties 
are real.

<p>

I was wondering if you could sort of look at that 
from a societal benefit. We were talking before. At the 
movie <i>Braveheart</i>, I was watching it and was kind of struck 
by the fact that these men and women were bound by their 
clan, by kinship and these blood lines, and because of that, 
they were going to fight and die together; and how, today, 
we have sort of made kinship optional.  Maybe you're 
related, maybe you're not.  I mean, these ties are very 
breakable.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And that is the biggest change, 
really, in the post-marital family, is that you don't have 
one family where everyone has the same ties and the same 
loyalties.  It is like you have certain relationships, your 
children have -- and some of your children may have 
different ones, and the only tie that still remains 
reasonably firm is the tie between mother and child.  Even 
for fathers, 10 years after divorce, two-thirds of fathers 
have virtually no regular contact with their children.

<p>

We are raising children, increasingly, in a world 
where all relationships are temporary and disposable, and it 
is very difficult for children to prosper or really for 
anyone to prosper in a world that is that really emotionally 
chaotic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that that really has 
implications from a national perspective.  There has been a 
lot of talk lately in pro-family circles about a need to 
rebuild a sense of American citizenship or of what does it 
mean to be an American, and yet we are talking there about a 
national consciousness. about a national tie, when what we 
have really communicated through a divorce-prone country is 
that ties are optional.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes.  I don't think, as I said, 
that either the conservative ideal of a limited government 
and a strong nation or the more general American dream of 
upward mobility, each generation better off than the last, I 
don't think it is going to happen unless we begin to deal 
with this.

<p>

Kristi, in just 10 years from now, if current 
trends continue, half of our children will be born outside 
of wedlock.  Half of the remainder will lose their fathers 
through divorce.  That means marriage is going to become, 
almost as a lifelong family-forming union, is going to 
become almost a cult practice, a rare minority.  And I don't 
think we as a nation will survive that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is everyone equally likely to 
divorce?  You know, we see half of all marriages do this, 70 
percent of the population does that, and that is very 
chilling to many.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes. No, it isn't. It is not 
spread uniformly, and there are a lot of different variables 
that affect it.  If you and your husband are both married 
for the first time, you will have a significantly lower 
divorce rate than if one of you has been divorced before.  
People who attend church or synagogue or temple regularly -- 
it actually doesn't seem to matter from the standpoint of 
holding marriages together what your religious denomination 
is -- if you're active in it, you have a lower divorce rate.

<p>

In general, educated and relatively affluent 
people have lower divorce rates than the poor, except for 
one very interesting exception.  Marriages in which both 
partners work full time have much more income, but they are 
also much more divorce prone.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why do you think that is?  Because 
you can't pick up the newspaper today without seeing a rise 
in two-income families.  And, frankly, at the Family 
Research Council we have been concerned about that, not 
because women shouldn't work but because a lot of women work 
to offset the tax burden on the American family.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Oh, sure. I think that it 
reflects a lot of disappointment. I mean, when women get 
married and have babies, it's a lot of work, and one of the 
reasons you undertake that work is because you want to spend 
time with your kids, you want a family life, you want to 
build a family life, and if, instead, you are having to 
spend all of your time working, it makes all of the 
frustrations of family life seem a lot worse to you.

<p>

Basically, I think a lot of women aren't getting 
what they wanted, which may be not necessarily working or 
not working but not being the primary breadwinners for their 
family.

<p>

It also, frankly, partly reflects, Kristi, 
sometimes when couples both become very career-oriented, 
there is not a lot of time left for the marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: They are just two people who are 
both more invested in their careers than their family life, 
and people like that are more prone to divorce.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have actually seen a lot of data 
on that in which people say that the give point is the 
marriage.  I mean, you can look at that statistically.  If 
you have home, husband, children, career, outside activities 
-- outside activities do tend to dissipate, depending on 
whether they are connected to your job -- but that, 
ultimately, it is that primary relationship between husband 
and wife, that is the easiest to put aside and say, "Well, 
we'll spend quality time later.  We obviously need to take 
care of our job and kids."

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Right. Well, those are the not 
optional, I guess.  They won't give you the pay check if you 
don't show up, and kids have a way of making themselves 
felt, so people often feel -- and again, I think it is 
worse, either if you are family-oriented and frustrated in 
that desire, you are going to be more frustrated with your 
spouse in your life and feel like you're not getting what 
you're supposed to be.

<p>

And then there is the opposite: if you are not 
family-oriented, if you primarily get your sense of self-worth 
from your job, you are going to be a prime candidate 
for divorce, anyway, and working doesn't cause it; it just 
reflects that orientation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, that is an interesting point 
that you bring up because, I mean, if you read again 
feminist literature or even your average glamour magazine, 
you are certainly going to get the message as a woman that 
your career -- don't let anything interrupt your career.  
That above all things is sacrosanct.  You know, you can put 
your children in day care and you can get another husband, 
but your career is the center.

<p>

And you are saying that the more connected your 
self-worth is to your career, the higher your possibility of 
divorce?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, I am not saying this is a 
fact.  I mean, it is a fact that two full-time working 
couples are more likely to divorce -- it does not apply, by 
the way, to part-time working wives -- but I mean, I think 
that if you talk to therapists and to couples who have 
divorced, it is an issue that comes up.

<p>

The question in a marriage is, What is first 
priority?  If the answer is your kids, that can cause some 
problems, but they are both of your kids, so that can be an 
acceptable answer.  If the answer is my job is more 
important than you are, your marriage is in trouble.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So you were talking -- one of the 
things I like about your book is, after it sort of outlines 
a very shaky foundation our society rests on because 
marriage is so stressed by kind of a divorce mentality, you 
are saying, Look, there are some answers.  So how can people 
build a lasting love, or what could society do?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, you know, we have to change, 
as I say -- these things did not happen in a vacuum, and we 
have been talking a lot about some of the cultural changes 
and the changes in our ideas of marriage and love and the 
kind of commitment we need to make, and all those are very 
important.

<p>

But something else happened, too, Kristi.  Around 
1970, our government became, for reasons that are difficult 
to fathom, very hostile to marriage as an institution, and 
in a lot of ways, people -- if you go back, there is no one 
saying, "Oh, I want to undermine marriage; I'll do this."  
But a whole series of changes came, passed through our -- 
which have really, I think, been very hostile to marriage.  
They range from, for example, the shift to unilateral no-fault 
divorce.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the laws became a problem.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Which is responsible for -- maybe 
as much as 25 percent of the increase in divorce rates came 
from that change in the laws, which -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I am going to have to hear more 
about this in two seconds.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: After this break, we will bring you 
more interesting revelations regarding marriage and its 
standing in today's society.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are trying to 
understand how our government has had an impact on divorce.

<p>

Maggie, you wrote about this really brilliantly in 
the book, and I certainly want to encourage people to buy 
the book and to read it.  But one of the problems that you 
are uncovering in terms of fixing the divorce problem was 
that some structures had gotten in the way of marriage.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes. The government has been very 
hostile.  You know, what unilateral no-fault did is really 
say we're not going to enforce the marriage contract 
anymore.  We're not going to let you get married.  When you 
get married, what are you doing?  Well, you're promising to 
live with someone until you feel like doing someone else.  
Well, guess what, Kristi?  That is rather like cohabitation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is true.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And one reason why I think 
cohabitation is on the rise is we have reduced marriage from 
a legal standpoint to where it is rather like living 
together with a license.

<p>

But there are a lot of ways government has drained money 
from families that is desperately needed.  Married couples 
are struggling.  They are not having children they want to 
have because they have to pay for subsidies to Amtrak and 
Dole Corporation, and it has been a very low priority, 
protecting family income.  That has had an effect.

<p>

And then we have rewarded in the form of welfare policies 
very destructive behavior, and I am particularly concerned 
with this whole issue of children having children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Then there are other things that people 
don't know about at all, which is, there are federal laws which 
have basically prevented local communities from enforcing 
basic moral standards.  If you, in your school, would like to 
deal with getting pregnant teens out of the classroom and put 
them in a special program and teach them what they need to 
teach and send the message that it is wrong to be 16 and 
having a baby out of wedlock, the reason you cannot do that 
is that the Federal Government has defined that as pregnancy 
discrimination, and you cannot have it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Public housing used to give a 
strong preference to low-income married couple, very 
important support for marriage in the working class, and 
again, that was abolished because the Federal Government 
said that was discrimination on the basis of marital status.

<p>

So there is a lot of work to be done.  There are 
terrible cultural trends.  But a lot of them are, if not 
driven, at least being reinforced by the government, and 
they are frustrating the desire of ordinary Americans to 
have control over their homes, their families, their income, 
and their community life, and that has to change.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, Maggie, 
and I really appreciate your joining us today.  But what one 
or two things can you tell us in this brief amount of time 
about marriage to help people have success in their own 
marriages?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, I guess what we really need 
-- people say we need to be less romantic.  But I don't 
believe that, Kristi.  I think we need to be more 
idealistic.  We need to recover a vision of marriage as 
being really heroic and extraordinary and worth making 
sacrifices for.  We need to say to people who are in the 
middle of troubles in their marriages that we think their 
struggles are valuable, that they are doing something 
important, and that we have faith for them when they don't 
have faith themselves that they can work their problems out 
and that the reward for doing so is worth waiting for, and 
that reward -- we are not trying to punish people; we are 
trying to help couples achieve their objective, which is a 
happy family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is a phenomenal book.  I want to 
hold this up, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>.

<p>

Maggie, thank you so much for being with us, and I 
think you are right, you know, and I have to say for myself, 
marriage is the best thing that I have ever done, and I know 
you feel the same way about your family.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to share 
more information regarding issues affecting you and your 
family.  Stay tuned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are going to discuss so-called 
easy answers to pregnancy, sometimes called the morning 
after pill, emergency contraception, or RU-486.  It all 
sounds like a worry-free procedure when described by the 
activists who are pushing its approval by the Food and Drug 
Administration, but some disturbing facts about the 
complications of those drugs are beginning to come to light.
According to pro-life groups, this two drug abortion method
could lead to severe physical, emotional, psychological, and
legal troubles if it receives FDA approval.  So we will hear
from some experts about the possible complications of this
so-called simple solution.

<p>

But first, a preview of an innovative part of the 
upcoming Republican National Convention.  I spoke with Gus 
Pace, the RNC's Co-Director of Internet Services and FRC's
own Internet expert, Loralei Gilliam, about the
opportunities in Cyberspace for all of those who want to
participate in the convention from their own home. In fact,
FRC president, Gary Bauer, will be available during the 
convention for a cyberchat. Let's here more about this 
exciting opportunity as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the 
Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, Gus and Loralei,
for being with us today on Behind the Headlines. You all 
are involved in a very exciting and revolutionary new way in 
which people can get involved in the Republican Convention.
You know, for the most part people watching conventions were
very passive, watching it on television, reading about it in 
the newspaper, but the Internet has offered some very 
exciting new opportunities.

<p>

Gus, I know you have been working on that.  Can 
you tell us a little bit more about what is going to happen?

<p>

MR. PACE: Well, I think what we are doing with 
the Internet and what the Republican Party is doing with the 
Internet is very exciting right now.  You know, the term 
there that you used, passive, is a very key term.  Always 
before, our participation in political conventions and in 
political activities and in campaigns has been very passive.
We read what is in the newspaper.  We see what is on 
television, and that is it.

<p>

The Internet, I think, has revolutionized that.
It gives us the ability to actually participate -- two-way 
communication.  You know, you can email the platform 
committee this year for the first time.  You can participate 
in live chats with members of Congress and senators and 
governors and elected officials and delegates at the 
convention.  This is a complete new way for the American 
democracy to become involved in the electoral process like 
we have never seen before.

<p>

You know, in 1962, the debates that were televised 
revolutionized the electoral process.  In 1996, I think this 
is sort of the test drive year for the Internet. I think we 
will see a lot of participation on the Internet. It gives 
us the ability to put all of our information, provide all 
the press releases, provide all the speeches, complete on 
the Internet, and you as an active participant or a person 
wanting to participate in the electoral process, can call 
this up from your local computer.

<p>

It does not matter if you are in a small town or 
in a large city or at a public library or at a friend's
house.  You can call up the home page.  You can read the 
speech for yourself.  You are not reading a two-paragraph 
clip that someone else has put together.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: No middle man.

<p>

MR. PACE: No middle man. So I find that very 
exciting.  I mean, I believe that when our message is out 
there and when people see our message complete that we have 
a good message, and it will sell itself.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Loralei, for those people who are 
watching our program and are not familiar with the Internet, 
how would they find this exciting opportunity and the Family 
Research Council connection?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The best way that I would suggest is 
to participate in FRC's home page.  By accessing our home 
page, we will have what is called a hot link that will link 
our page directly to the convention site.  So that way they 
are able to get FRC's input from the convention, in addition 
to looking at our news releases on what is going on at the 
convention, but at the same time linking to the convention 
site and seeing directly what is going on there.

<p>

The convention site is very innovative in what 
they are able to do with live footage.  You can actually 
click in and see exactly what is going on on the convention 
floor.  From my understanding, this is the first time that 
this has ever happened.  This is going to be real exciting 
for folks to be able to click in and then go into a chat 
room and talk with folks in California, Texas, Missouri, and 
be able to talk about what is going on and see if they are 
in agreement and turn around and use that input and send 
emails to their members or send emails to the platform and 
put their input in on the convention.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gus, I know you have been working 
very long and hard hours developing a lot of things for 
people to enjoy and connect with.  Could you tell us a 
little bit more about what is going to be available?

<p>

MR. PACE: Sure, if I could just follow up a 
little bit with what Loralei said about the Family Research 
Council being a key component, and your home page is a key 
component.  You know, we have designed a very unique 
interactive home page that will exist during the two weeks 
of the convention.  It will be unveiled on the fifth, the 
day the platform discussions take place.  It will be active 
and continue through the entire convention.  The chat rooms 
will all be up and live during the platform.  You will have 
the ability to participate in platform discussions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And there are going to be some news 
makers participating in that.

<p>

MR. PACE: We will have some news makers scheduled 
during the evening to chat live with you, answer your 
questions.  I will give an example of on Tuesday night the 
state of Missouri has organized a Missouri Night on the 
Internet, and as part of their grass roots organization, the 
local clubs are being encouraged to host their own 
convention parties where they invite their friends in.

<p>

You know, everyone does not have Internet access.
I mean, as I mentioned, this is the test drive year.  So 
they are being asked to invite their friends in or go to a 
library or a public place where there is Internet access, 
and they will have the ability to chat with all the Missouri 
elected officials that are at the convention.  They are all 
going to be on-line for an hour-and-a-half, and this is just 
one example.  There are other states that are doing that, 
also.

<p>

I know that your group, for example, several of 
your members may decide that there is one night that they 
want to have friends over and participate in the convention.
This is something that has never happened before.  To get 
groups together before, you called them around the kitchen 
table, you opened up the newspaper, you read the newspaper, 
and then you discussed what was printed in the newspaper.
This gives you the ability to click on one icon on the home 
page and watch the podium live, like you are on your 
television, or if you do not have that software, you can 
click on another icon and get the printed textual update.  
Then if you want to go into a live chat room and ask some 
questions of your elected officials, you have the ability to 
do that all at one time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So, Gus, to ask a quick question, 
Gus, are you all working with the Internet site going to be 
monitoring the input and the email to pass along to Haley 
Barbour and the GOP leaders what people are saying?

<p>

MR. PACE: Yes, we will.  We will have a 
continuous content update.  As quick as a speech is given 
from the floor, it will be updated to the home page.  There 
are a couple of really neat things.  Haley will be calling 
in and providing an audio update to the RNC home page about 
once an hour, just sort of a this is what is taking place.  
The week of the platforms, all official platform positions 
will be updated immediately.

<p>

So people will have the access to that 
information.  They can read the complete platform.  They can 
read the complete speech that was given.  They will know who 
is on the platform talking right then.  You are not relying 
on a news anchor or someone else sort of to give you a 
synopsis of what is taking place.  You get the complete 
picture as it is occurring, or you can go back and see what 
was said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A wonderful opportunity like this 
that has opened two-way communication is, of course, going 
to open the GOP up in the convention to hearing some 
critical voices and some people who have different kinds of 
opinions.  How are you guys prepared to deal with that kind 
of feedback?

<p>

MR. PACE: Well, you know, our founding fathers 
wrote of a truly informed and participatory democracy.  I 
mean, I think the Internet gives us the ability to do that.  
I am sure there will be some people that will participate 
that will probably express opinions that are a little 
contrary, but our biggest advantage is an informed 
electorate, and I think that once the electorate sees our 
message complete and reads it that they will see we do have 
the best message.  You know, we are not relying on small 
clips of a message.  We have a complete package here.  We 
have a complete party and a complete package.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: I think that is one of the most 
exciting things for our constituents, because so many times 
they feel that they are not able to get all of the 
information, that they are restricted to the media that 
tends to give a liberal bias to the information that is out 
there.

<p>

This way they are able to actually see word-for-word what is 
happening and what is said, and then they can 
make their own informed decision about what was spoken, and 
they are able to participate and get involved, and that was 
part of what was so exciting in 1994 was the grass roots 
actually were able to make a difference, and this is going 
to give them the tools to continue to be involved in 
politics.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If you are sitting down at the 
computer and you are going to pull up some kind of search 
engine, what kind of words could I type in to get to the 
convention or to FRC's site?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: For FRC's site, it would be www.frc.org.  Easy.

<p>

MR. PACE: And you can go straight from the FRC 
site to the RNC site.  There will be a hot link.  But I 
would encourage everyone to participate.  I mean, we have 
developed what I consider is a phenomenal on-line presence 
this year.  The thing that will make it successful is if 
people come and participate.  Never before have they had the 
opportunity, and we have given them the opportunity this 
year. So I encourage everyone to participate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to be highlighting this 
exciting opportunity on the program and supering it 
throughout, because we want people to make this important 
connection.  Is there anything else you can add so that our 
viewers can really get something different out of this 
special convention?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM:  Well, this allows our constituents 
to get involved, and I think this is very important for them.

<p>

MR. PACE: And I would just say come join us in San Diego.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, both Gus and Loralei, for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will begin our 
discussion about RU-486, the most vogue method of abortion 
today:  how simple is it?

<p>

Please stay tuned to find out.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape of National Right to Life Conference follows.]

<p>

DR. GLASOW: The RU-486 site-detect prostaglandin 
technique is the first first-trimester chemical abortion 
method to seek licensing in the United States and is the 
first chemical abortion method of any kind to be seeking 
licensure in over 20 years.  Dr. David Kessler, the 
Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, President 
Clinton's appointee to that position, has put this RU-486 
abortion method on a record-breaking fast track approval for 
U.S. marketing.  The licensing application was filed a mere 
4 months ago, and Kessler promised that the whole process 
would only take 6 months, which is about one-third of the 17 
months that fast track drugs usually take.

<p>

Based on our concern for both the mother and her 
child, tomorrow we will testify before the only public 
hearing that will be held before the FDA makes its final 
decision on approval.  RU-486 is not a contraceptive or a 
morning after pill and is being licensed only for abortion.

<p>

DR. HARRISON: Proponents of chemical abortion 
claim this is almost a swallow a pill and poof, the 
pregnancy disappears. This is pure medical fantasy.
Chemical abortion requires a four to six step procedure 
taking place over weeks.  The woman has not one but two 
drugs to take on two separate occasions, requiring at least 
three separate pelvic exams until the woman finally passes 
the fetus, and she may pass the fetus any time any place 
over those two weeks.

<p>

DR. FRANZ: RU-486 abortions are marketed as 
providing benefits over surgical abortions because they are 
supposed to be private, patient-controlled experiences that 
are somehow more natural.  These characteristics may 
actually predispose the woman to having greater 
psychological problems.  It is possible for the woman to be 
alone at home when she aborts.  Since it is important that 
she identify the contents of her womb, she must look at the 
results of the abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The facts regarding RU-486 are more 
disturbing than many would like the public to believe, so 
tonight we have some special guests to present the rest of 
the story.  I would like to introduce you to Olivia Gans, 
who is head of American Victims of Abortion, a long-time 
Washington activist, and also Gracie Hsu, a policy analyst 
with the Family Research Council, who has worked extensively 
on the RU-486 issue and shares with us some of her findings 
tonight. Thank you both for being with us.

<p>

I would like to start first with Gracie, and I 
know, Olivia, you have been working on this issue at 
National Right to Life for quite a while, but the thing that 
we always hear about chemical abortion is that this will be 
a simpler process.

<p>

We have this surgical procedure in which you go 
and have the baby taken out by a vacuum suction method or a 
new thing, partial birth abortion, some extraction 
techniques at the end of abortion, but is a chemical 
abortion -- first of all, let's take their claims -- simple?

<p>

MS. HSU: No, it is not. As you know, a surgical 
abortion requires maybe a 15 to 30-minute procedure, and it 
is a surgical procedure.  So there is not bleeding 
prolonged.  But when you talk about RU-486, there is 
actually a lot of prolonged bleeding, and this is a 
procedure that takes over the course of 2 weeks to 30 days, 
and you have to go into the doctor's office the first day to 
be administered the drug, two days later to receive a 
prostaglandin, which actually induces labor.

<p>

So you are actually going through the process of 
labor, and because it is a poison -- it is a hormonal change 
in your body -- your body reacts pretty violently, and so 
there is a lot of nausea and vomiting and a lot of bleeding 
involved, and in fact, we know that many women have had to 
seek hospitalization, narcotics for pain killers.  Some have 
even had to undergo transfusions because of the hemorrhaging.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing I found startling -- I 
thought I was pretty informed about this -- but when I was 
reading up for the show, that anti-inflammatory drugs like 
Advil or Aleve or some of the typical ibuprofen kind of 
drugs, you know, like a woman in that kind of pain who might 
take an Advil, that is actually a bad decision, that there 
are counterindications for all kinds of drugs that a woman 
in that kind of pain might even take on her own.  What are 
the dangers of some of these drugs?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, I cannot speak to the narcotics --

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, there are different 
complications.  We do know that certain types of drugs like 
the ones you have mentioned can increase bleeding, can 
increase other complications.  The drugs are synthetic 
drugs, after all.  They are very powerful synthetic drugs.  
They are being introduced into an otherwise healthy and 
normal condition of female bodies -- that is, pregnancy.  
Pregnancy is not a disease.  There is nothing abnormal about 
a female body being pregnant.  It might be uncomfortable at 
certain times, but it is not abnormal, and it certainly is 
not a disease.

<p>

So you have these two powerful synthetic drugs 
being introduced into a healthy body.  Then you are asking 
perhaps for other interactions from different types of 
drugs.  If she does, for instance, use narcotics to try to 
numb the pain or to stem the bleeding, all kinds of further 
complications, because you are not then talking about one or 
two drugs, but maybe three or four different drugs, all 
going into an otherwise healthy body.  There is just no 
sanity in that, and it makes no logical sense to people on 
both sides of the issue to insist that this is a reasonable 
and logical course of action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I want to ask more about that later, 
because what is interesting about RU-486 and the morning 
after pill is you see feminists and actually pro-abortion 
advocates saying, look, I am concerned about this chemical.

<p>

But Olivia, you understand abortion from a 
personal angle, as well. Can you tell us a little bit about 
your experience?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, I am a mother of an aborted 
child. I did have an abortion in 1981, and I am very 
conscious of the ramifications of making that decision and 
also the dynamics that go into finding a woman in the 
position where she would even consider abortion a reasonable 
thing to do. I have also been working for 15 years now in 
the pro-life movement, for 10 of those years as the director 
of American Victims of Abortion, and I have worked with 14 
countries outside the United States, where I have had the 
opportunity to listen to other women like myself who have 
experienced surgical abortions and who recognize that 
abortion is always an act of violence committed against 
unborn children and their mothers, that both of us are 
harmed.  Our children lose their lives, and we may lose our 
lives, and here now we are talking about another effort on 
the part of abortion providers to expand the number of 
abortions being performed, to come up with yet another way 
to destroy our children, and leave women without the real 
life-affirming options that they seek.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think from your 
experience and from working with women overseas, and 
obviously a lot of the RU-486 and chemical things have taken 
place in France and testing there, and other countries have 
been more aggressive in pursuing it.  How do you think women 
are psychological going to react to a surgical procedure 
versus something that could take a month, a month of 
bleeding, a month of pain, a month of doctors' visits? What 
is your assessment to date of the psychological trauma that 
that could give a woman?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, unfortunately, as with all post-abortion 
syndrome complications, there has not been enough 
significant research, and what is present is anecdotal at 
best.  Now anecdotal research is valuable, because it sets 
the criteria for statistical research, but the evidence is 
pointing to serious trauma, the most powerful part of the 
trauma coming from the mother of this child actually having 
to identify the unborn child that she has passed and making 
sure that she has in fact passed her baby, that the baby has 
not remained inside, and she has simply experienced 
hemorrhaging.

<p>

She must, therefore, look at the result of having 
taken this drug with her own hand, and for many 
psychologists who work in the area of post-abortion 
syndrome, it is that dynamic, asking this woman to take with 
her own hand the drugs that are intended to kill her unborn 
child and then to identify that in fact her child is dead.  
That will be -- and I can tell you, as the mother of an 
aborted child, that will, in fact, I believe be the most 
profoundly affecting thing that occurs during the entire RU-486 
process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, you do not really hear 
about that at all, Gracie.  You and I deal with this at 
Family Research Council, and we know that one of the biggest 
complications of this is if the child does not pass.  There 
can be infection.  There can be incredible bleeding, as the 
body attempts to follow through with the chemical process, 
but women must examine then everything.

<p>

MS. GANS: What they have been told is a product
of conception.  Remember that they have been told up to this
point you will be passing a clump of tissue, a lump type of
substance may pass from your body, and then what she sees is
what some people refer to as the teardrop baby.  Many people
may be familiar with the picture of a two-month-old child in
what is the shape of a teardrop, the amniotic sac, and there
inside is a perfectly formed tiny child whose eyes you can
see, whose tiny little developing hands are quite visible.
The spinal column is visible at that point.

<p>

All of these things can be seen if when she passes 
the amniotic sac it is more transparent than bloody, and 
that is what I believe is the height of cruelty to women to 
ask them to believe the unbelievable at that point.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, this has been highly 
politicized by the FDA.  As we noted on the tape before, 
this has way been escalated beyond what we are looking at 
for other drugs.  Why are we looking at taking something not 
to deal with disease or injury?  Why are we escalating a 
chemical that causes an abortion when it is not as if there 
are not other abortion procedures available if that was what 
you wanted to choose?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, that certainly is the question of 
the hour.  We know that President Clinton in one of his 
first acts of office removed the ban that would allow RU-486 
to be imported into the United States, and furthermore, Dr. 
David Kessler, who is the commissioner of the FDA, has also 
said on record in congressional hearings that he wants to 
see this put on a six-month fast track, and that, again, is 
purely political, and when we spoke to the population 
council on the day of the hearing itself, they said that the 
reason why they were pushing this, even with incomplete 
data, even with incomplete analysis of the U.S. clinical 
trial, they said that the reason why they are doing this now 
is because they want to do this before the presidential 
elections, because if on the small chance that President 
Clinton does not get reelected, then they will not have an 
advocate in the White House any more, and RU-486 would be 
dead in the water.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. We are going to have to 
hear more about this.  When we come back, we will hear more 
from our experts regarding RU-486 and the damaging effects 
it can have on children.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are continuing 
our discussion about RU-486.  We are joined by Dr. Camilla 
Hersh, an obstetrician and gynecologist who has worked on 
this issue, a long-time activist; Olivia Gans, director of 
American Victims of Abortion; and FRC policy analyst Gracie 
Hsu.  Welcome back, and welcome, Dr. Hersh.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Thank you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, I have known you for a while 
now.  We were talking a little bit before about why this 
drug is coming quickly, kind of the political motivations, 
but one thing that has been problematic in the discussion is 
that as it is being discussed as so simple, and they are 
doing it in France, so why can't we do it here?  But what 
would be different about the way it is being discussed in 
application here than France?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, Kristi, I am really concerned 
about that, because, for one thing, in the French trials the 
whole procedure was very, very strictly controlled.  Each 
patient had to be registered by name, her address, where to 
find her, and France, compared to our country, is a 
relatively small place, and I have a lot of concerns about 
compliance in any trials or the release of this, the 
potential release of this terrible medication in our 
country.  We are a much bigger place.  We already have a 
much bigger problem with compliance.

<p>

One of the things that my patients often say to me 
when they describe their abortion experience is that halfway 
through, they really wish they could have changed their 
mind. They asked the doctor to stop.  They pleaded to stop.
But of course, things were so far along they could not stop, 
and I do not think it takes too much imagination to realize 
that once a woman takes the handful of drugs that they give 
her at the first visit and then she leaves, a lot of those 
women are not going to come back.  They are going to get on 
the plane and go back to Kansas City and see if Mom and Dad 
can help them out.  They are not going to complete the 
process.  We are going to have a large number of children 
deformed by this horrible drug.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are some of the deformities 
that can take place?  I have read a vast amount of 
information about complications, but what first and foremost 
are the complications to any children that might result, and 
then what are other complications for the woman?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, of course, Kristi, it depends on 
what week in pregnancy the woman takes this medicine.  A lot 
of major organs are under formation at that point.  At the 
very end of the time that would be allowed to be given, the 
heart has been beating for three weeks, the little fingers 
are formed, but a couple weeks earlier, the midline facial 
features are coming together as the baby is being formed in 
the uterus.  Children that have been born that have had 
similar medications given at that point in pregnancy are 
missing limbs, missing the completion of their fingers, 
missing -- midline facial defects would be more common.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like cleft palates?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Cleft palate, cleft lip, where the 
nose does not come all the way together in the center,
holopresencephaly[?] -- that is a long word for those
things.  And frankly, no one really knows, because there of 
course are not any studies where you could ethically test 
medicines that act at this point in pregnancy.  You just 
have to anticipate from the organs that are forming, and 
every two or three days, something major during that time in 
pregnancy is being formed.  All of our major organs are 
formed and in place by eight weeks from the last menstrual
period.  So it is a very critical time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, what has been the response 
of the Clinton administration and the FDA when groups like 
yours and Olivia's say we do not know enough about what is 
going to happen in RU-486, and frankly, we are pretty sure 
that American women are not going to comply as French women 
have?

<p>

MS. HSU: Yes, that was the most interesting 
result of this hearing.  A lot of the doctors on the 
committee did make reservations, and they did say we do not 
have complete U.S. data, we do not have all the information 
that we need, especially when it comes to compliance in the 
inner city and the low-income people who may be taking this 
drug and who may even be targeted because of this drug, but 
interestingly enough, they chose to gloss over it.  The 
chairperson of the group said, okay, with these reservations 
then, let's take these serious reservation under 
consideration, and let's vote anyway.  It was silly.  I 
mean, I think everybody who was in the audience, especially 
the press, could see that there were some major questions 
that were left unanswered but that they chose to continue in 
this process because they really wanted to get this through 
the FDA as soon as possible.

<p>

MS. GANS: If I may interject at this point, with 
relationship to what we know and don't know about RU-486, 
and I am sure Dr. Hersh can amplify this, but one of the 
things that is completely unknown really is the long-term 
effect on different population groups, which often have 
different health needs, different circumstances, dealing 
with their own biology because of different ethnicity 
sometimes, different issues. To say that we know what we 
need to know based on the experience of France or Sweden or 
Great Britain is completely erroneous, because one of the 
population groups, for instance, which has to be seriously 
considered separately from the general population are Native 
American women, and to my knowledge, there is a very small 
number of Native Americans living in Sweden.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So it is incredibly scandalous, actually, that the 
FDA would suggest that we know what we need to know about 
this non-homogeneous population, which is the United States 
population, and we can go ahead and unleash this into an 
unsuspecting female population.

<p>

DR. HERSH: It is really a mockery of the 
standards that we expect to be in place to protect us as 
women in this country.  There are a number of population 
groups that are at greater, incredibly greater risk of 
complication with RU-486.  You mentioned Native Americans.  
African Americans, Asian Americans, and again, what portion 
of the populations of France and Sweden have any significant 
number of those individuals?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What percentage of the women in some 
of the testing had to have a surgical abortion because the 
follow-up showed that the abortion had not been completed 
with the chemicals?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, it varies. Depending on which 
of the studies you look at, anywhere from 2 to 13 percent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that is in a very controlled 
setting with a doctor checking you and with them being very 
able to ascertain that.

<p>

MS. GANS: But take that to its nth degree.  Two 
percent of what could be as many as 300,000 RU-486 abortions 
a year is upwards of 20,000 women requiring surgical 
abortions per year.

<p>

DR. HERSH: And that does not factor in that you 
can guarantee a certain percentage of women are not going to 
even comply to the point of coming for that second 
appointment. It is really frightening that the FDA can just 
gloss over. Imagine if our FDA had glossed over the 
complications, say, of thalidomide, which was a medicine 
used for nausea.  It was a wonderful medicine for nausea and 
pregnancy.  It was released in France and in Europe with a 
very minimal amount of testing, and there is a whole 
generation of thalidomide affected individuals who have no 
arms, have no legs. They are mentally intelligent, healthy 
people, but without any limbs it is hard to get along.

<p.

Our population was saved from that disaster 
because the FDA did not approve it.  There were not 
sufficient studies for use in pregnancy, and when there is 
something that is going to be used in such large numbers in 
this country, it is going to have tremendous repercussions, 
and who is going to bear the emotional, the financial -- 
name your risk.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to ask more 
about that in a moment.  Please stay tuned for more facts 
surrounding the newest in abortion methods, RU-486, when 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once 
again our experts who are discussing the most recent pro-life 
battle, RU-486.  With us are Dr. Camilla Hersh, Olivia 
Gans, and Gracie Hsu.  Welcome back.

<p>

Gracie, one of the things that kind of is an 
interesting counter-melody to this entire discordant 
discussion about RU-486 is there have been a lot of people 
saying, look, we really do need to reform the federal Food 
and Drug Administration; the FDA has been too slow; we have 
not done enough for high risk people with AIDS and cancer.
So maybe the speeding up of RU-486 is a good thing, because 
it shows that the FDA is being more sensitive.

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, obviously not. It has shown that 
their priorities are all out of whack.  If you consider 
something like an AIDS patient or a cancer patient who has 
no other option and an experimental drug could do some good, 
the FDA should put that on a fast track.  The FDA should see 
that that gets first priority, not an abortion drug that has 
not cleared its final testing in the United States, that has 
not cleared a lot of the standards that the FDA normally 
recommends.

<p>

But beyond that, I think it is interesting that 
Congress right now is putting forward an FDA reform bill 
that would speed up the process for a lot of these life 
saving drugs, and this obviously is not -- RU-486 is not a 
life saving drug by any means.  Not only is it harmful for 
the child in question, but it is also harmful for the 
mother.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And in fact, there is a lot of -- 
one of the things that I have not read anything about except 
in pro-life literature is that some women would really be at 
high risk to take that.  It is not a one size fits all drug.  
What are some of the risk factors for women that would say, 
look, you in particular should not use this drug.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Kristi, there are several risk factors 
that are actually pretty ordinary.  Anyone who has asthma.  
Now a lot of people who have asthma do not think they have 
asthma.  They call themselves exercise wheezing or wheezing 
when they have allergies or wheezing when they have a cold, 
but in fact, they have low-level asthma.  Women who have 
asthma are at great risk for exacerbations of their asthma 
and cardiac arrest with these kinds of drugs.

<p>

Women who have recently taken anti-prostaglandins, 
which you think, well, I do not take any anti-prostaglandins, 
but how many times in the last week have you 
taken an Advil, a Nuprin, an Aleve.  Hello!

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

That makes you at increased risk for hemorrhage 
afterwards.  Anyone who has had uterine surgery, a recent 
cesarean section, anyone who has a history of ectopic 
pregnancy, anyone who has a history of pelvic infection, 
anyone who has a history of uterine fibroids.  Probably half 
of women by the time they reach age 40 have at least one 
fibroid.

<p>

The list goes on. Those are pretty common things 
for women to have. Women of Asian ancestry have a much 
higher risk of hemorrhage afterward.  There is no logical 
explanation for that; it needs to be studied, but they pick 
up a higher incidence of that.  One of the reasons that 
women of Native American descent have a higher problem is 
that they often have undiagnosed diabetes. Women with 
diabetes have a much higher complication. Women who smoke.

<p>

So you put together someone who is nervous, she is 
bleeding and passing clots, she took the second dose of 
medicine.  She does not know what to do.  She usually 
wheezes with stress.  She is starting to wheeze.  She quit 
smoking three weeks ago, and so she wrote on the form that 
she is not a smoker, but really she just has to have a 
cigarette, and maybe if she just took some of those Advil in 
the closet she would feel better.  You put those things 
together, and that is not an unusual thing, that scenario 
that I just put together. That is a person who may have her 
complications coalesce into a death.

<p>

Another thing that is very scary to me is in the 
few studies that have been done in this country, it seems 
already that the complications are being swept under the 
carpet.  There is the woman in Iowa --

<p>

MS. GANS: Perhaps the most -- that is Dr. Lavier's[?] case?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Right, hemorrhaged.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us about some of those complications.

<p>

MS. GANS:  Well, Camilla probably could explain it 
far better, but the simple story is that one of the women in 
the trials did begin to hemorrhage.  She lost a full half 
volume of her body content of blood before going to the 
emergency room.  The surgeon who was brought in was Dr. Mark 
Lavier, who was at the testimony the other day at the FDA 
hearing, and his concern was brought to the fore because 
shortly after treating this woman and saving her life -- she 
was on the verge of death when she was brought to the 
emergency room by her distraught husband -- he saved her 
life only to read in the papers just shortly thereafter the 
reports of Iowa Planned Parenthood that there were no 
complications in the Iowa trials.

<p>

DR. HERSH: When they were questioned, they said 
that complication was not outside the expected realm of 
complications.

<p>

MS. GANS: So death is expected.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Major hemorrhage requiring transfusion 
and near death is within the expected range of complication.  
As a woman, I find that frightening.  But that is not 
reported.  As a doctor, I find that frightening, that it is 
not reported as a complication.

<p>

MS. GANS: That is the most dangerous thing about 
the case with Lavier, as Dr. Hersh points out.  They tried 
to back up, once Dr. Lavier brought it to the presss 
attention.  There was no offer on their part to admit that 
there were complications.  It was only when Dr. Lavier 
brought it out and said wait a minute, you are telling half 
truths, because I treated one of the women who almost died 
in your trials.  Then they tried to back pedal and say that 
this was a reasonable complication which we can live with.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So death is a reasonable 
complication.  I mean, where are the women's rights
activists who are supposed to be champions of what is good 
for women?  I mean, we have lived through thalidomide.  We 
have lived through IUDs and the Dalkon shield and toxic 
shock and everything else. I mean, breast implants. You 
can't open a women's magazine without seeing a story on how 
horrible corporate America has been toward women.  Why 
aren't we worried about the implications of a drug like 
this?  Gracie, what are feminists saying?  Where are our so-called 
advocates on this?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, they certainly are not on the side 
of women's health.  They are on the side of abortion and 
abortion alone. NARAL, NOW, all of these pro-feminist 
groups have come out saying that women want this drug, that 
women want to abort their children this way, and that this 
is a good thing, and unfortunately they have had to sweep 
aside the data, because the data clearly show that there are 
so many questions, so many complications that will occur.

<p>

DR. HERSH: And there is no information whatsoever 
about long-term complications from this drug.  If you simply 
look at the organ systems that this drug affects -- a 
person's uterus, her fertility -- what happens to someone 
who has maybe two of these kind of abortions within a 6-month 
period?

<p>

If you think about it, 40 percent or so of all 
abortions are repeat abortions.  What if someone uses this, 
as many people use with abortion, as basically a family 
planning method?  What happens when this builds up in your 
system?  What happens to your breast tissue?  The breast 
tissue is also in an incredible growing phase during early 
pregnancy, and this drug is going to act on the progesterone 
receptors in the breast tissue.

<p>

What is going to be the impact on breast cancer?
There are already some clues with other studies that the 
risk of breast cancer may be increased with just an ordinary 
-- if you can call any abortion ordinary -- surgical 
abortion.  What happens to the rest of our bodies? What 
happens to the fat storage where medicines build up? What 
happens to your risk of other long-term malignancies? There 
is no study.  There is not even any animal data on long-term 
complications.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, I am sure the animal rights would be better 
organized than women.

<p>

DR. HERSH: You can just count on it.

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, I think the bottom line here is 
who is organized on this issue are the pro-abortionists.
The abortion agenda is highly organized, totally mobilized 
on this front, and as we have said already, Bill Clinton's
agenda is part and parcel of their agenda. Probably the
only promises Bill Clinton has not broken are his promises 
to the abortion lobbying groups, and here we see the end 
result of that.

<p>

Bottom line here, what the abortion providers want
to see are more physicians performing abortions. They are
upset that doctors are getting out of the abortion business.
They want to see abortionists increased. They do not care 
at the end of the day whether women's lives are hanging in 
the balance, and they certainly do not care that their 
unborn children are dying.  So for many of these groups, as 
was stated at the trials, it was admitted that more 
physicians would perform abortions if this drug was 
available.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

After this break, <i>Straight Talk</i> continues our 
discussion of RU-486.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are wrapping up our 
discussion of RU-486 with tonight's special guests, Dr. 
Camilla Hersh, Olivia Gans, and Gracie Hsu.

<p>

Olivia, I would like to ask you, working with the 
National Right to Life and certainly being long-term in this 
particular field, one of the success stories has been fewer 
and fewer physicians being willing to participate in 
abortion.  RU-486 kind of deals with that.  How does that 
work together?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, let's understand why doctors 
don't want to be abortionists. Doctors do not want to be 
abortionists because they recognize that there are two 
people involved in every abortion decision, the mother and 
her unborn child, and of course, with the advent of all of 
what we know from ultrasound technology, the science of 
fetology, these doctors are now able to actually treat in 
the most minute ways this second patient, and suddenly now 
you are seeing young physicians, and older physicians, 
saying no, we will not be a part of this violent horrible 
act.  This is not why I became a doctor.  So these 
individuals are dropping out like flies, and thank Heavens 
they are.  They are not staying in the abortion business.

<p>

But the increase in RU-486 abortions precedes for 
some people what has been a problem with actually having to 
participate in a hands-on way killing the second patient.  
So the abortion providers presume that if the doctors do not 
actually have to lay hands on the second patient, more of 
them will become abortionists.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They would be willing to write a 
prescription and do what they would not do with their own 
hand.

<p>

MS. HSU: Data actually shows, for polling data, 
that a greater number of family practitioners and not 
surgical abortionists would choose to use RU-486, but beyond 
that, it is interesting, because family practitioners do not 
have necessarily the medical knowledge and the training to 
undertake the complications of an RU-486 that does not 
result in a complete abortion.  So what has happened is that 
the population council said in the testimony itself, oh, it 
is okay.  Any doctor, any medical student, is trained to do 
the gestational age, to do complications of pregnancy, and 
every single committee member shook their head and said no, 
you have to be trained to do surgical abortions.

<p>

DR. HERSH: It does bring up a different kind of 
compliance problem.  We have talked some about the 
compliance problem of the patient who changes her mind or 
doesn't follow the directions or doesn't come back, but the 
compliance of the abortionist, the chemical abortionist, if 
you will, is that unless you are experienced in the use of a 
particular procedure or a protocol, the chance of mistakes 
is going to be very high -- giving the wrong amount of 
medication, giving it at the wrong time, diagnosing how far 
along in the pregnancy the woman is, knowing how to follow 
basically the management of an intentional induced 
miscarriage, whether the woman has passed all the parts of 
the baby, whether she is developing an infection afterward, 
how much bleeding is a normal amount of bleeding, how much 
bleeding is a non-normal amount of bleeding.

<p>

If you did then need to do a surgical abortion 
after a partial abortion, whether it is spontaneous or 
induced, the uterus is a much more fragile organ at that 
time, the chance of perforation and further damage, 
lacerating the cervix.  I could probably go on and on, but 
you are right.  There is much more chance of basically 
medical malcompliance as you have fewer trained people 
following the patient carefully.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. You even have the abortion 
advocates almost bragging that you could have nurses or 
physicians assistants involved.  We can cut the doctor out 
totally.

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, you have to look at what has 
happened to those of us that have had abortions.  Since 
abortion was legalized, we have seen the casual disregard of 
the woman as patient, let alone -- obviously the baby is 
invisible, completely irrelevant in this experience, but now 
women are --

<p>

DR. HERSH: But these babies will not be so 
invisible.  We are going to see thousands and thousands of 
birth defects entering our society as a result of 
incompleted chemical abortions.

<p>

MS. GANS: The only thing I would say is that in 
fact they are claiming that doctors will have more attention 
to their patients and more understanding, and they cannot 
possibly, because as women have been treated more and more 
like cardboard objects on the table, as the abortionist 
kills their children, and the assembly line of the abortion 
industry has continued, this is just another way to speed up 
the assembly line process and to once again remove all 
connection and all responsibility for the decision that is 
actually being made.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, we have about 20 seconds 
left. This could come up quickly. Tell me how quickly.

<p>

MS. HSU: We can see this within the next 2 months 
perhaps. The full agency of the FDA will come out in favor 
of recommending this for marketing in the United States.
One of the most problematic things is that the one
manufacturer that is going to do this, this RU-486, is 
called Advances in Health Technologies.  They are a brand-new 
corporation.  We do not know whether they are going to 
be manufacturing here or overseas, and they do not have any 
assets.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to get phone 
numbers, and we are going to invite our -- thank you to my 
guests, and I certainly hope people will call, and when 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, you will hear how you can receive 
more information regarding the issues affecting you and your 
family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are live from the Republican
National Convention.  It has already been an exciting few
days, and you have probably seen Gary Bauer, Family Research
Council's president, on many networks and on news shows. We
hope you have been watching the national policy debate and
seen Gary fighting for family issues during the Republican
platform hearings and on the floor of the convention.

<p>

Tonight we bring you more about those issues and
what the Republican Party promises for your family in the
future with some very special guests, including former 
Republican Presidential candidate, Ambassador Alan Keyes.

<p>

But first, let's go to Family Research Council's 
Kristin Hansen, who is live on the convention floor.
Kristin, I know that they have started the coverage. What 
do we have to look forward to this evening?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Hi, Kristi. We are going to have so 
much fun this evening.  We have a great lineup of 
interviews.  We are going to be first talking with Rick 
Santorum and, hopefully, Senator Dan Coates later on.  We 
have the Young Republicans behind us.  So it is sure to be a 
fun evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kristin, I can't wait to hear more, 
and we are going to be talking to Kristin throughout 
tonight's show.  But first I would like to introduce a key 
player in pro-life policies and the platform hearings, 
Colleen Parro, Executive Director of the Republican National 
Coalition for Life; and I am also joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, who is Family Research Council's leader of our 
government relations.  Welcome, both of you.

<p>

Colleen, you all have been working for a long time 
getting us to this point.  The convention means, really, 
your work is done.  What has gone into getting us here, 
especially those interested in pro-life policies?

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, a lot of hard work. We have 
reached out to pro-life Republican primary voters for the 
last five years, letting them know that the threat to the 
pro-life plank was real and that there was something that 
they needed to do about it.  We encouraged them to get 
involved in their precinct and county and state conventions; 
to get elected a delegate to the Republican National 
Convention, if possible, and many of them have done so; and 
in addition to that, to try to get on the Platform 
Committee, and many of them did that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the pro-life platform that we saw 
come together last week was a five-year process.

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, yes, actually. We have had a 
pro-life plank in the Republican Party platform since 1976 
calling for a human life amendment to the Constitution.  But 
the effort to overturn that really started in earnest by 
Republicans for Choice in 1992, and they have continued 
their efforts to try to strip the pro-life plank from the 
Republican platform.  We expect that they will continue to 
do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would think so.

<p>

MS. PARRO: And that is why it is so important for 
people to get involved in the process and to be here every 
four years to make the statement that this is the pro-life 
party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, you have been on Capitol Hill 
for 20-some years and now with Family Research Council.  How 
important is the platform in GOP politics?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it is particularly 
important when you have a Republican President.  I can 
remember when Reagan and Bush were both in the White House 
and there were some staff who might have tried to steer them 
in one direction or another.  It was very helpful to be able 
to go back and say this is the position that is in the 
platform, and there would be letters signed by Members of 
Congress, and so on, that would reinforce that point.

<p>

So it is very important because it is a point at 
which people really get focused on policy.  You do hear a 
lot of people say, "Well, it is ignored after the 
convention."  But that is not really the case.  It really 
does set the blueprint for the policies that are in effect 
by the Congress but more particularly when you do have a 
President of the same party in the White House.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know it hasn't escaped your 
attention, Colleen, that Vice President Al Gore and 
President Clinton at one time said they were both pro-life.
How do you help people remember their pro-life grass roots,
you might say?

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, what is important for us to 
remember is that the platform is an excellent platform, and 
it is pro-life, but it takes grass-roots pressure from the 
bottom up to make sure that elected officials attempt, at 
least, to turn the principles in the platform into public 
policy and law.

<p>

We are seeing somewhat of an erosion of that 
support among the Republican leadership in Congress.  We 
cannot afford to let down on our job, which is to hold them 
accountable to the platform and to not be afraid to stand up 
to your local Congressman and say, "Hey, wait a second.  We 
want to restore the right to life in this country.  What are 
you doing to get that done?"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, as somebody who has been on 
Capitol Hill, Marty, that kind of pressure, does that work?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It does. Like I say, we would 
get Members of Congress to sign letters.  You might get 20, 
30, 40, 50 Members of Congress to point out in a letter to 
the White House, this was the position in the platform; this 
is the position that we expect to abide by.  It has been 
helpful to have that in there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Standing by with Kristin Hansen, we 
have Senator Rick Santorum, a pro-life fighter, a real 
leader.  Senator, thank you so much for being with us on 
<i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, thank you. It's good to 
be with you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Kristin, have the Senator talk to us 
about the importance of the kind of policy debate that we 
have seen take place over the last week.

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, I think what we have come 
out and done in this convention with this platform is we 
have stood up for principle; that we have made very direct 
statements as to what the Republican Party believes in.

<p>

You know, I am a conservative who was elected in 
Pennsylvania, in a state where they say you cannot elect a 
conservative. What I found out, and what Spence Abraham 
found out in Michigan, and Mike DeWine in Ohio, is that what 
the voter wants is someone who is going to provide a clear 
vision for this country, who is going to stand up and fight 
for what they believe in.

<p>

They don't expect to agree with you on every 
issue.  But what they do expect you to do is to stand up and 
be honest, be forthright, and to deliver what you said you 
were going to do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, I am sure that you have 
seen that Jack Kemp is our new Vice Presidential candidate, 
used to represent New York, right on the border of 
Pennsylvania, a big football player.  Tell us, how do you 
think the Jack Kemp selection plays in Pennsylvania?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: I think it will be very 
helpful.  Northwestern Pennsylvania, which obviously borders 
the Buffalo area and in fact gets a lot of the Buffalo 
television, is going to be a very strong area for us.  We 
just elected a governor from up in that area, and it is a 
swing area which we are going to do very well in now as a 
result of Jack.  Jack played football in Pittsburgh, frankly 
not very well. He only played five games for the Steelers.
But, you know, he lived there, he is known there a little 
bit, people remember him, and I think it will be a plus for 
him.

<p>

And just his message. I mean, Jack has such an 
inclusive message that is really going to help us in cities 
like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where we are going to 
reach into communities that frankly are not traditional 
Republican areas. So I think, overall, that vision, that 
energy is going to be very helpful in Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One last question, Senator, and I 
really appreciate your taking the time to be with us.  There 
has been a lot of talk about inclusiveness in the big tent, 
but would the Republican Party be a pro-life party?  How 
would you describe its commitment on that issue?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, I don't think there is 
any question that the platform is clear.  I mean, we are a 
pro-life party, and the Democratic Party is a pro-abortion 
party. I don't use the term "pro-choice" because what the 
Democratic Party platform is, abortion on demand at any time 
during the pregnancy for any reason.  I mean, that is the 
extremist plank on abortion.  That is the plank on abortion 
that is well out of the mainstream, and I think we contrast 
very well with a party that says life is important, and that 
we stand up and we respect the right to life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Fantastic!

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Senator, we had read that Dan 
Quayle, in his draft comments for this evening, was going to 
mention President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth 
abortion ban.  Have you heard anything more up to date on 
that?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: I am not, but I am working 
very, very diligently on trying to override that veto.  I 
mean, the President allowing that barbaric procedure to 
occur is just -- what a horrible commentary it is on the 
moral leadership of this country, and frankly, if we don't 
override it in the House and Senate and the American public 
doesn't mobilize behind this, I think it is a horrible 
commentary on this country as a whole if we allow that to 
continue.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. PARRO: Senator, I have a question for you.  I 
am wondering, since Senator Dole the other day said that he 
had not yet read the platform and that, if he did, he would 
not feel bound by it, what efforts do you think are going to 
be made among Republicans to see to it that the Dole-Kemp 
ticket actually runs on the platform?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, you know, I think Bob 
Dole is making the statement like you would about a piece of 
legislation.  I haven't read every word of it, but I 
generally agree with its direction, and he is going to run 
on the themes and issues that were in the platform.

<p>

Bob Dole's record on the pro-life issue is 100 
percent; his record on most of the issues in the platform is 
right in line with that platform.  I mean, I think we 
shouldn't worry too much and picket our candidate.  I think 
what we should do is recognize that with a Bob Dole 
Presidency and with a Republican Congress, we are going to 
move forward on a lot of fronts that Bill Clinton is 
stopping us on right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, as a former Pennsylvanian, 
I have to tell you that my parents are always telling me 
what a champion you are.  We really appreciate your being 
with us on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

When we come back, we are going to have more, live from San Diego.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are very excited to have you back 
with us at <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>
where we are broadcasting live from the 1996 Republican 
National Convention.

<p>

We have Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell at the 
podium.  A lot of you may be watching.  There are a lot of 
issues that we are talking about here that affect you and 
your family, and we have been going to a lot of trouble to 
bring you some of the best in the business to give you 
insight into pro-family issues, other family issues.

<p>

I am joined by a very special guest, Ambassador 
Alan Keyes, and also Marty Dannenfelser from the Family 
Research Council.  Thank you.  It is a privilege to have you 
here with us.

<p>

How does it feel?  You obviously were making your 
way to San Diego, thinking perhaps that you would be 
candidate, and now you are here watching all this take 
place.  What kinds of thoughts are going through your mind?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, actually, my campaign, as 
I said repeatedly on the trail, was not so much about Alan 
Keyes becoming the nominee as it was about making sure this 
party stayed on track with its moral principles, its pro-life 
principles, that we had a strong pro-life plank in the 
platform, that we had a ticket in which the Vice 
Presidential candidate and others were not pro-abortion.

<p>

I think we have achieved all those objectives at 
this convention. I feel very pleased about that. I think 
there are, obviously, still some problems.  The convention 
organizers want to project, for reasons best known to 
themselves, an image of the party as a pro-abortion party  
that is not committed to the principles of the platform.  I 
think that is a great mistake.  But I think that we did 
succeed in making sure that the delegates who come to this 
convention are true to Republican principles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I mean, it is quite a pendulum if 
you think about it.  We started with maybe Christine Todd 
Whitman and maybe Colin Powell as a Vice Presidential 
candidate and let's get rid of the platform to Jack Kemp and 
a strong pro-life platform.  Do you think that a lot of what 
you were talking about maybe might have changed that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think it had an impact.
A lot of people were doing a lot of hard work in that
regard:  Phyllis Schlaffly, Gary Bauer, Jim Dobson, others
who had the courage and heart to speak up and to send a
clear, strong signal to Bob Dole, to the Republican Party
leadership, that the grass-roots Republicans were not going
to tolerate an abandonment of the pro-life principle and
that that would not be the best route for the Republican
Party.

<p>

I think, in any case, this fear of the pro-life 
issue on the part of the leadership is inexplicable, since 
the pro-life position has been our position, as we have 
gained strength all around the country, won Presidential 
elections, taken back the Congress.  I think if they pretend 
that there is some political liability involved here, it is 
a lie and they know it, and that some of them are doing it 
simply because they are not really committed to the moral 
principles that then lead to the pro-life position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, you have seen the impact of 
Presidential races on Capitol Hill.  What happens as leader 
like Ambassador Keyes speak out on the life issue?  What 
kind of buzz happens on Capitol Hill?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it emboldens people who 
support the pro-life position, and it is very encouraging to 
those pro-life Members of Congress who sometimes get 
discouraged by their own leadership's lack of willingness to 
speak out on the issues.  So it is important to have people 
with the moral courage of Alan Keyes out there speaking 
forthrightly to the issues and speaking with clarity as to 
why this is so central to our national purpose.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have been talking to a lot of the 
delegates about why they are here, and it was interesting 
that more than half, almost 60 percent of the delegates, are 
first-time delegates.

<p>

As we have been doing some of the pro-life 
activities through RNC for Life and, obviously, Gary Bauer 
at Family Research Council talking to them, a good many of 
them got into this just because of their concern for the 
unborn.  And yet, earlier today, I was in Voice of America 
in a debate where a gentleman from Republicans for Choice 
was telling me that the abortion issue is a killer for the 
Republican Party.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, you know, that is, as I 
say, the simple lie that has been spread.  I don't believe 
that even the people who tell that lie think that it is 
true, since all of the polling that was done after 1992 
showed pretty clearly that the pro-life position did not 
hurt George Bush; it was his stand on taxes and his failure 
to keep his no-new-taxes pledge that hurt him.

<p>

It is also clear that, in 1994, overwhelmingly, 
pro-life, moral Republicans accounted for our ability to 
take the Congress from the Democrats.  How can that be a 
political liability?  It makes no sense.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have standing by Kristin Hansen 
on the convention floor.  Kristin, whom do you have with you 
now?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Hi, Kristi. Right here with me I 
have Mr. Marco Gillam(?).  Mr. Gillam, where are you from?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: San Antonio, Texas.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: San Antonio, Texas?  And why have you 
come here to the convention?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I am an alternate from the 20th 
Congressional District.  We don't have a Congressman there 
because his name is Henry D. Gonzalez.  We want to get more 
Republicans in the Congress.  We want to get a Republican in 
the White House.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: And what have you got here?  Oh, 
you're wearing a hat.  What does the hat say?

<p>

MR. GILLAM:  The hats are distributed by the 
Republican National Coalition for Life, a pro-life 
organization, and most of the Texas delegation is wearing 
it.  Fortunately, they go with our ties and our Texas 
accents.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: How do you think the Dole-Kemp ticket 
will do in Texas?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: They will carry Texas easily.  We are 
very excited that Jack Kemp is aboard.  I feel we are going 
to go forward together now and defeat Bill Clinton.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Mr. Gillam, how do you feel the life 
issue plays in Texas?  Do you see any kind of a drag on the 
ticket?  Certainly a lot of media coverage this week has 
indicated that it has been a bad thing for the GOP.  What is 
your position?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: What, the pro-life issue, did you say?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is correct.

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I think the majority of Texans are 
pro-life.  I know our delegation and the grass roots we 
represent who elected us up the line are opposed to 
abortion, especially partial-birth abortion.

<p>

It is an exaggerated issue. The pro-abortionists, 
I feel, are basing their arguments strictly on emotion.  I 
don't think it is going to be a drag.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, how have you seen -- as the 
different delegations have been put together, some have 
tried to say that it is not that the majority of Americans 
are pro-life but that they control the process.  Do you 
think that is accurate?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the pro-life people have 
been very committed to getting their people elected during 
this process.  That part is true.  But I think you see all 
too often that the network camera people and the talking 
heads in the news booths are very much out of step with the 
American people on the life issue, and they repeatedly frame 
the issue in a way that is not really representative of the 
true pro-life position.  But the grass roots do oppose most 
abortions in most circumstances, and the polls have been 
showing that repeatedly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Mr. Gillam, you are standing by, I 
know.  Have you seen the life issue to be the majority 
position of your fellow statesmen, or do you think it is 
that you have been more involved in the process?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: Could you repeat the question?  I 
could barely hear you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. Do you think that the pro-life 
position is that of the state of Texas, or do you think 
you guys have just been more active in the process?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I can't hear hardly at all.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Mr. Gillam, thanks so much for 
being with us, and I am going to ask that same question to 
Ambassador Keyes.  Ambassador, what is your perspective?  Do 
we control the process or do we have the philosophy on our 
side?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, two things are true.
One, I think it is true that pro-life moral conservatives 
are more active in the process.  That also means, of course,
come election day, they are going to be more active in 
distributing the literature, more active in carrying people 
to the polls, more active in knocking on doors, more active 
in spreading the word.  So their activism goes beyond the 
pro-life issue and really becomes the key asset for 
Republicans on election day, the activism of that moral 
conservative core of the party. Without them, I don't think 
we can win victories.

<p>

I also think that the election results would 
suggest that this business of pro-life being somehow not the 
view of the people is wrong.  If that is the case, why is it 
that pro-life conservatives can stand up, run for office, 
and win?  Why did they win overwhelmingly in the course of 
the 1994 election?  Why is it that not a single pro-life 
incumbent in the Congress was defeated on the Republican 
side in that election?

<p>

So I don't understand where these arguments come 
from when the facts simply don't track with this notion that 
the pro-life position is a political liability.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: You know, yesterday there was 
another primary in the state of Colorado, and the pro-life 
candidate in the Republican primary won a very decisive 
victory against a pro-abortion candidate.  A week earlier, 
there were three pro-life candidates in the states of 
Kansas, Georgia, and Michigan that won their victories, and 
it was a clear-cut challenge between pro-life and pro-abortion 
in all three cases.

<p>

So time after time we have seen this. We saw Pete 
Wilson and Arlan Specter run in the Presidential race.  
Their candidacies went nowhere, and it came down to 
competition between several pro-life candidates.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have a call on the line.  It is 
Nancy from New York.  Nancy, do you have a question for 
Ambassador Keyes or a comment about what we are watching 
right now?

<p>

CALLER FROM MILESSES, NEW YORK: Well, Ambassador 
Keyes, I think you're great.  I love you.  I would have 
voted for you or a libertarian, but I don't like the 
libertarian view on a strong defense.  I think that is 
imperative.

<p>

But I wanted to say is I don't know why you give 
the courtesy to the Democratic Party to say they are pro-choice. 
They are pro-death.  To me, pro-choice is my choice 
between abstinence and free sex.  When you get under that 
umbrella, it is either pro-life or pro-death.  It is the 
guilt of the women in America.  We don't understand there is 
grace for us, and the inability of us to say, "We were 
wrong.  It's death.  I'm guilty.  Forgive me."  That's it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nancy, that is a very interesting 
point that you raise, and I want to make a point for all of 
you watching that you can call if you call 1-800-5000-NET 
with a question for Ambassador Keyes, who is going to stay 
with us through the show.

<p>

But, Ambassador, what is your response to Nancy's point?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think she is correct.
Generally speaking -- I mean, I don't know if I said 
something to the contrary just a few minutes ago -- but I 
use the phrase "pro-abortion," not "pro-choice."  I think 
that the pro-choice slogan was a very shrewd one.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: In one way it does raise an 
issue, because I think what these people represent is the 
view that freedom consists of making any choice you please, 
and we know that if you define it that way, it then becomes 
a curse because it implies that there is no responsibility, 
no moral discipline, and that in turn undermines your 
ability to maintain a decent society and strong institutions 
in that society like the family.

<p>

So I think in that respect the notion that they 
are pro-choice does convey something about their 
irresponsibility.  But the truth is, in this context, they 
are pro-abortion and pro-death, just as the caller says, and 
generally speaking, I use that phrase "pro-abortion" because 
I think that this notion that I am against abortion but, 
which then leads to a tolerance for the sanctioning of this 
as a legal matter, that basically is a cop-out, and it 
leaves the evil abroad, which means that you support its 
existence.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have another caller on the line.
1-800-5000-NET for you to call and participate in this to 
ask a question for Ambassador Keyes or make a comment about 
what is going on behind us.

<p>

Again, we are live from San Diego.  We are going 
to look forward to talking with you.  Stay tuned as <i>Straight
Talk</i> brings you more of the national GOP convention.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are live from the 
Republican National Convention, where we are talking to a 
true warrior for America's families, Ambassador Alan Keyes, 
and Marty Dannenfelser, our Director of Government Relations 
at Family Research Council.

<p>

Behind us, former Governor Carroll Campbell is 
talking, but I understand that Kristin Hansen has a special 
guest with her.  Kristin, you have Senator Coates with you?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Yes. Hi. I am down here on the 
floor with Senator Dan Coates of Indiana, definitely a 
champion of the pro-family movement.

<p>

Senator, we have been here with the Family 
Research Council working with the platform hearings, and we 
were definitely happy with the way things went last week.
And now I know definitely people in the pro-family movement 
are interested in the Dole-Kemp ticket, and how are they 
going to stick to the platform in the next couple of months 
and in their campaign?  What do you think we are hoping to 
see with the Dole-Kemp ticket and the platform?

<p>

SENATOR COATES: You know, we were all pretty 
happy with the way the platform came out, and it is a 
document that I think forms the foundation of our party, 
what we believe and where we think the party ought to go, 
where America ought to go.

<p>

But the reality of it is not that piece of paper.
It is the translation of that paper into the reality of 
action of legislation, of carrying out the basis for all the 
various agendas and programs that are incorporated in that 
document.  That has to be a decision of the President, the 
Vice President, and the party to say we are going to take 
that piece of paper and we are going to turn it into 
reality.  That is our job, to make sure that that happens.

<p>

I really believe that the Dole-Kemp ticket and the 
people they will surround themselves with will advocate what 
we believe and share in our beliefs in terms of 
demonstrating to the American people that we care about the 
values, the underlying fundamental values that are important 
to the future of this country.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: What do you think people in Indiana 
are looking for in action under the Dole-Kemp ticket, 
especially families?

<p>

SENATOR COATES:  Well, I think they want to see a 
recognition of the fact that the family is the most 
important building block of society.  There is no government 
agency that will replace the family.  And, therefore, what 
we can do to strengthen the family, both through the tax 
code, through government policies that don't impact 
negatively on the family but rather encourage family 
formation, a strong declaration that the family is the 
essential foundation of America and we are not going to 
broaden that definition to include all different forms of 
what some people think constitutes a family, I think those 
are essential elements of what ought to be done in the next 
four years.

<p>

Also, I think we have to recognize that the family 
is torn asunder these days in many of our communities, in 
many of our neighborhoods.  And to the extent that we can 
reach out with proactive, conservative social programs, many 
of which I have outlined in my Project for American Renewal, 
to strengthen the family, I think that we need to take an 
active voice.

<p>

So there is a lot that we can do to change the 
definition and the direction that this current 
administration has taken in regard to the family and bring 
us back to a traditional base.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Kristin, if you can hear me, or 
Senator Coates, Senator, you are well known for working on 
welfare reform and on compassionate and community 
involvement.  How do you think welfare reform is going to be 
a part of this coming election battle?

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Well, the resolution that we have 
come up with in Congress and that Bill Clinton has signed is 
a recognition that the American people's voice has been 
heard as far as the White House, and Bill Clinton 
politically could not afford not to sign that.

<p>

I have defined this as step one of the welfare 
revolution.  We have taken the important step of 
transferring power out of Washington back to the states.  We 
have taken the important step of telling people that we are 
no longer going to allow them to live a lifetime of 
dependence on the Federal Government paying the bills; that 
they are going to have to get a job, they are going to have 
to take responsibility for their children, they are going to 
have to take responsibility for their lives.  We will help 
them in the transition, but it is a transition, and there is 
an endpoint to it.

<p>

But the second step ought to be to energize those 
institutions like the church, like the family, like 
volunteer associations, like Habitat for Humanity, church- 
or faith-based organizations to deal with some of these 
social problems that break down the family that government 
has not successfully dealt with.

<p>

We have spent trillions of dollars at the federal 
level with lousy results, terrible results, so we have 
condemned people to lifetimes of dependency.  And yet there 
are organizations across America that don't rely on 
government for their funding and for their ideas that are 
just reaching out with Christian love, reaching out with an 
involvement of themselves in other people's lives and 
bringing the transforming power that spiritual renewal can 
bring to lives, and that is where our future is in terms of 
how we deal with a lot of these problems.  They will not be 
solved in Washington.  Washington can feed the body, but it 
cannot feed the soul.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, thank you so much for being 
with us today on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>.

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Sure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We really appreciate that, and 
thanks for your leadership on welfare reform.

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ambassador Keyes and Marty both, how 
do you think welfare reform debate and those kinds of values 
issues are going to play and have been playing?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think that it is kind of hard 
to see how welfare reform is going to be an issue in this 
election campaign given that the Congress and the President 
just agreed on a welfare reform effort which they passed, 
and you saw it.

<p>

That, by definition, kind of knocks the issue off 
the table as a point of difference, unless Bob Dole can 
define a bold proposal that would take things further than 
they have been taken as yet by the Republican Congress 
working with the President.

<p>

I think that is one of the dangers of progress in 
terms of reaching agreement on an issue just before an 
election.  Sometimes people say that prevents any progress 
from taking place before election time, but clearly, both 
the Congress and the President in this case thought that it 
was smarter for them to be seen doing something in an 
election year than just fighting about it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But, Marty, we at the Family 
Research Council, and you in particular, have been working 
on things like the family cap and dealing with not extending 
additional benefits as more children are born out of wedlock 
into the home.  Why have you seen the family cap as being 
important in welfare reform, and where is that right now?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the parliamentary process 
in getting the bill passed prevented that family cap from 
being included in the final product.  It was in the bill 
that was passed by the House of Representatives, but it got 
knocked out under a parliamentary objection in the Senate 
because of the process they were using to get the bill 
passed.

<p>

However, the bill does take away the need for many 
of the states to go hat in hand to the Federal Government to 
get waivers to implement that family cap and other similar 
proposals at the state level.  So that will probably be a 
boost that the states can do these things more on their own.

<p>

I think another interesting question is going to 
be what happens down the road, because some of these 
programs are going to remain in place for a few years and 
then be phased out, and there was a battle between the 
Clinton White House and the Congress about whether or not to 
extend the benefits after five years, and they did allow 
them to use federal funds through some other programs other 
than welfare after five years.  So that is still going to be 
something to see if there is an effort to maintain this 
federal support for welfare, or will it truly be turned over 
to the states at the end of that time period?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like family tax relief has 
been the favorite theme of the Republican convention to 
date, but a lot of moral issues -- life, welfare reform -- 
have been very hard-fought and hard-won.  We are going to 
talk about what other issues we think are important in this 
next election cycle.

<p>

Remember, if you are watching at home, you are 
welcome to call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more from Alan Keyes and Kristin Hansen and Marty 
Dannenfelser, more here live at the Republican National 
Convention.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i> is back with more live coverage of the 
Republican National Convention.  We are talking to you from 
the convention floor, and we are joined by a man who has his 
own followings of supporters amongst the Republican Party, 
Ambassador Keyes.

<p>

We have Kristin Hansen on the convention floor,
but we also have a caller on the line from Vermont. Hi.
Welcome to <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

CALLER FROM FAIRLEE, VERMONT:  Hi.  Ambassador 
Keyes, it is a distinct honor to address to you two short,
interrelated questions:  If abortion is considered a woman's 
private choice, then why is it paid for with public funds?
Isn't this taxation without representation?  Thank you very 
much.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is a very good 
question.  I think it really makes us all, as supporters of 
the public treasury, complicit in a choice that many people 
regard as immoral and that they are saying is entirely the 
private choice of that individual.  But if it is entirely a 
private matter, why should it be supported with public 
funds?  There is a contradiction there, and I think that 
contradiction actually points to the fact that this is not a 
private matter at all; that it is in fact a matter of 
concern because it violates an important public principle of 
justice, which is that all men are created equal and endowed 
not by their mothers' choice but by the Creator God with 
their unalienable rights.

<p>

So I think you are right; that is a contradiction 
that shows that within that pro-abortion position there is a 
self-confessed error where they try to say it is a private 
thing and then want to support it with public funds.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take another call now, Ed from 
Pittsburgh.  Ed, are you with us?

<p>

CALLER FROM PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA:  Yes, I am here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what is your question or comment?

<p>

CALLER FROM PITTSBURGH: First of all, it is a 
distinct honor to speak with you, Ambassador Keyes. The 
first question I have is, were you or would you consider 
being a running mate for Senator Dole?  And the second 
question is, are we going to see you back on track in the 
year 2000?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, as I often told people, 
the man who thought that Colin Powell might be his first 
choice didn't have Alan Keyes second on his list.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And I think it took, to tell you the honest truth, 
a lot of honest pressure from moral conservative groups to 
make it clear to Bob Dole that that pro-abortion temptation 
was a bad idea, and he finally ended up with Jack Kemp, who 
doesn't emphasize the pro-life issue, is not really a pro-life 
leader but at least has a solid record of support for 
the pro-life position.

<p>

So I think that that is about the best we could 
have hoped for, given the strong temptation that Bob Dole 
seemed to have in the other direction, and that, 
unfortunately, is also exemplified in the lineup at this 
convention, which seems to be afraid of standing forward and 
presenting to the American people the clear argument for the 
pro-life position, which I think is a unifying argument that 
inspires Americans.  It is not, as they are trying to make 
us believe, a divisive argument.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much, Ambassador.

<p>

We have another caller, Heather, in Fayetteville, 
Tennessee.  Heather, thanks for joining us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.
Your question or comment?

<p>

CALLER FROM FAYETTEVILLE, TENNESSEE: Yes. I
would like to know why, every time I turn on the TV and 
watch the convention, all I see is pro-abortion speakers.  I 
don't see any pro-life speakers.

<p>

I will say I cannot vote for Bob Dole, I will not 
vote for him, I don't trust him, and you know, as they say, 
to get elected you run conservative, and once you are in 
office, you govern liberal.  Bill Clinton did it.

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that's what they say: run right and govern left.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think the caller puts her 
fingers on something that I have been disturbed about, that 
many others have pointed out, have been disturbed at.  As I 
say, they are putting a pro-abortion face on the Republican 
Party in spite of the fact that the body is strongly pro-life, 
and they claim that this is because there is some 
political liability in the pro-life position, but that claim 
is not supported by the facts.

<p>

That would lead me to think that some of the 
leaders who are pushing us in this direction are doing it 
because they want to jettison the pro-life position because 
they do not believe in pro-life principles and because they 
are looking, I think, to form an immoral coalition between 
the forces of unbridled greed and the forces of unbridled 
lust, and I don't think that is going to be good for the 
country or good for the Republican Party, and I think they 
should stop it, and I will be recommending as much as I can 
to Bob Dole, to Jack Kemp, and to others that they 
understand the winning position for this slate is going to 
be one that points to Bill Clinton's anti-moral, anti-family 
positions and really drives home the fact that we need a 
better alternative, not one that emphasizes economics to the 
exclusion of morality.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to take some 
more callers in a moment, but first let's go to the 
convention floor. Kristin, you are standing by with Senator 
Rod Grams.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Yes, we have Senator Rod Grams from 
Minnesota.  Senator, thanks so much for joining us.

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Thanks, Kristin. My pleasure to be here.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: I would like to ask you, we have 
heard a lot about hope, growth, and opportunity in the last 
couple of nights.  I would like to ask you, can we 
realistically cut the taxes 15 percent and reduce the 
deficit?  How will that help families, and how should 
families be watching that?

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Well, when we talk about cutting 
taxes, what are we really saying?  We are saying that we are 
going to let families and individuals keep more of the money 
that they work so hard for rather than sending it to 
Washington, so that they can be in control and make the 
decisions how best to provide for their children and their 
family needs. So we need to cut taxes to give them that 
opportunity.

<p>

Second, we need to reduce taxes so that we can 
have economic growth.  I mean, that money is going to be 
spent.  It is going to be spent by families and not by the 
government.

<p>

So it is not a question of either balance the 
budget or give tax relief; that is not an either/or.  The 
question is, we can increase this pie through economic 
growth so we can give tax relief, provide more revenues, 
because we will have more workers and lower taxes, and we 
can balance the budget.

<p>

So it is something that goes hand in hand. It is 
like a hand-in-a-glove type of mentality.  But when the 
Democrats say that we cannot afford to do it, what they are 
saying is the era of big government isn't over, and we want 
that money in Washington rather than in your pockets.

<p>

So it is very important.  There is a big 
difference between our agenda and theirs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, thank you so much for being 
with us.  Unfortunately, we have to go to a break shortly.
But do you think we will get that $500-per-child tax credit?

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Well, we have been working on it 
since 1993.  Bob Dole has made it a very important part of 
his tax package, and we have a lot of support both in the 
House and in the Senate.  So will we get it?  If Bob Dole is 
President, you can bet that that will be a part of our 
budget in 1997.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Senator, thanks for everything you 
are doing for the family.

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares 
more about family issues being addressed here at the 1996 
Republican National Convention. Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are watching Olympic 
heroes come out to the podium.  We are live from San Diego, 
where Washington, D.C., has been transplanted at the 
Republican National Convention, and we are reporting from 
the convention floor and talking with our special guest, 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, along with Marty Dannenfelser, who is 
leading government relations in Family Research Council.

<p>

First we have a caller. Caller, are you there?
Do you have a comment or a question? Steve, I understand.

<p>

CALLER FROM SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA: Right. Yes, I 
do.  First of all, I would like to thank you all very much, 
especially Ambassador Keyes, for taking this call.

<p>

I have a statement to make, then a recommendation, 
and then I am soliciting your comments.  The statement is, 
I am pro-choice, the choice being sex versus no sex, 
protected versus unprotected sex, which is then followed by 
personal consequences.

<p>

My recommendation is that if there is then a fetus 
or any other consequences, that the issue be framed in terms 
of pro-life versus pro-death.  And now I am looking for your 
comments.  Thank you.  But the pro-choice issue is sex 
versus no choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ambassador, your response?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I have to say that there is a 
bumper sticker out there that I have always found a very 
good one, and it says, "I am pro-choice until after 
conception."

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I think that that is 
exactly right. It emphasizes the fact that, unlike what 
they try to make us believe, there is an element of choice 
involved in this, but it is the element of sexual 
responsibility, and you are exercising a choice when you 
decide that, outside of marriage, you are going to engage in 
sexual activities; and if, as a consequence of that, a new 
life is coming into the world, that is not the point at 
which you get to make your choice.  That child is not a 
choice; it is an obligation.  And it does not belong to you, 
because it belongs to God, and God has determined both its 
life and its rights, and you are supposed to respect them.

<p>

And that, by the way, is not a personal statement 
of Alan Keyes; it is a statement of American public 
principle which we should respect as a people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A powerful sentiment, and one we 
haven't heard much of yet from the podium.

<p>

Theresa from Louisiana, do you have a question or 
a comment for us?

<p>

CALLER FROM SUGARTOWN, LOUISIANA: Yes. I want to 
tell Alan Keyes that I really admire him and that I agree 
with everything he says.  But I would like to hear his 
comments on this subject.

<p>

I just turned from CNN, and they were really
bashing the Republicans for Jack Kemp's flip-flop on
affirmative action and on the Prop 187 in California, and
they say that he is doing -- well, they quoted "Empower
America" as saying that he had switched on his own volition,
but they really bashed the Republicans for putting that spin 
on it, saying that he is being a good VP, and why don't they 
just admit that he is following Bob Dole's lead?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, you know, I guess I would 
have to say that it probably is of his own volition but that 
he has decided of his own volition to follow Bob Dole's 
lead, and that it is good to be honest about that.  I saw 
that headline and said, "Well, Jack is acting like a Vice 
President already," and that is exactly what he has to do, 
and he knew that when he accepted the position.

<p>

So I don't think it should come as a surprise to 
us or to anybody else.  George Bush had to do the same thing 
when he decided to accept the Vice Presidency with Ronald 
Reagan on some issues, and I think that is what it means to 
run as Vice President.  That is why you have to ponder it so 
hard before you accept that position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Hold someone's hat and agree with them.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the positions that Bob 
Dole and now Jack Kemp have on those two issues are 
consistent with the positions that are espoused in the 
Republican platform. So I think it is a good thing that the 
two candidates are now running in sync with the Republican 
platform.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We have a special guest standing by.
Kristin, I understand that you are down there with Senator 
James Inhofe.  Senator, thanks so much for being with us.

<p>

SENATOR INHOFE: Well, thank you. It's nice to be 
with you.  It's kind of fun here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, I'm glad to hear it.

<p>

Tell us, Senator, as you take a look at a lot of 
the discussion of unity, I am sure there is a lot of 
excitement about the tax policy.  Do you think that pro-family 
conservatives are going to have a lot to be excited about, too?

<p>

SENATOR INHOFE: Well, yes. Oh, I think they 
ought to be really excited. You know, I gave a talk today 
to a group that is sponsored by Coke Industries, a very 
large group, and by coincidence I was to be on the platform 
speaking with Jack Kemp.  That was set up before Jack Kemp 
became the nominee for Vice President.  So we had a chance 
really to talk about these things in a spirited way.

<p>

I think when you look at the tax cuts that are 
right out of the chute that Bob Dole proposed, that is very 
pro-family, you know, the $500 tax credit per child and the 
reduction in taxes, the whole idea.

<p>

I was at a town hall meeting in Sapulpa, Oklahoma,
the other day, and a gal named -- a real good friend of mine 
who came -- her name is Beverly LaHaye(?) -- she said, "You 
know, government has deprived me of my opportunity to be 
charitable."  That is what we are going to change in this 
country.

<p>

I am very excited about what is happening here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, we so appreciate your 
taking the time to be with us.

<p>

Marty, you have been working on welfare policy.
Do you think that a change will allow people the chance to 
be more charitable?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think so, and I think 
that Senator Coates earlier really touched upon it, that 
that is what we should be looking towards, is to give people 
at the local level the opportunity to do more within their 
own communities, and that is the type of charitable help 
that will really make a difference in people's lives, 
because it is much closer to home, and they know exactly 
where it came from, not from a faceless bureaucrat in 
Washington.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you see any connection, 
Ambassador Keyes, in the welfare state, where we are kind of 
dehumanizing people in a way, and the abortion mentality?  
Has there been a seepage over of our philosophy, kind of 
downgrading people?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think that both of them 
come, ultimately, from a failure to recognize that what 
defines human beings is their moral capacity, and I think 
that denying that moral capacity means that you set up 
programs that treat human beings as if they are ripe for 
dependency, have no initiative, can take no responsibility, 
and will not be accountable for their own lives and actions.

<p>

And so you hand them a handout, you don't ask that 
in exchange they show some respect and work and try to build 
up their lives, which, of course, is what is done at the 
charitable level by churches and by community groups where 
people work one to one and really have to deal with one 
another as human beings, showing respect for that moral 
capacity and that sense of responsibility.

<p>

And, of course, abortion rests on that same utter 
denial that we must be responsible for the consequences of 
our actions and that same radical selfishness which looks to 
someone else to bear the burden for your condition and 
situation.

<p>

In the case of the welfare state, it is some 
faceless taxpayer through some faceless bureaucrat from whom 
you get support, and in the case of abortion, it's the 
innocent life of that child that is going to be taken rather 
than having you take on the responsibility you should.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tough issues.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: But the spirit is the same in both cases.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank you so much, 
Ambassador, and so much, Marty.  We look forward to having 
both of you on <i>Straight Talk</i> again. I know our viewers 
will, too.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  We 
have been coming to you live from San Diego.  Some things 
you saw on television; some things we showed you -- 
convention highlights when the Republicans were here in 
California.  The Democrats are in Chicago right now, but 
there are still more highlights, some more things that you 
didn't get to see on the networks or on some of your 
favorite programs.  So please stay tuned for more convention 
highlights from San Diego while we talk to you about what's 
going on Behind the Headlines. 

<p>

</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for taking
time out of your busy convention schedule to meet with us.

<p>

You have been here now for almost two weeks.  You 
came for the platform committee, and now we are in the 
middle of the convention.  As you evaluate the last two 
weeks, how would you describe what has happened?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, Kristi, first of all, it has 
been extraordinary to run into just literally hundreds of 
delegates that are at a Republican convention or any 
convention for the first time in their lives.  I have run 
into teachers and home-schoolers and just typical mothers 
and professional people that, over the last couple of years, 
have gotten into politics because they care about family 
issues or the sanctity-of-human-life issue.  And now here 
they are at a major party convention representing their 
states.  So that has been really exciting. 

<p>

The other thing is that these folks have 
accomplished some things here.  They have a good, 
conservative platform, because so many of them were elected 
as delegates.  I think they have had an indirect influence 
on Bob Dole's choice of a running mate.  I think the Dole 
campaign knew that they had to go with a running mate who 
was a solid conservative and also had a pro-life voting 
record. 

<p>

So I am impressed, and I think the delegates here 
ought to feel pretty good about themselves. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Again, in fact, the delegates really 
-- that story is one that confirms some things that you have 
said all along.  About 50 to 60 percent of the delegates 
describe themselves as being pro-family, pro-life 
conservatives.  Do you think that that reflects the kind of 
energy that you have seen nationwide? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: No question about it.  The real growth 
in the Republican Party all around the country is coming 
from pro-family and pro-life activists.  I mean, the 
economic issues are extremely important to the Republican 
Party, and the economic issues are also family issues in the 
sense that American families are working harder and harder 
and they are falling further and further behind on the 
treadmill.

<p>

But when you really go out around the grass roots, 
it is not so much the economic issues as it is the sense 
that there is something that has gone wrong with the 
culture, that the family has broken down -- the 1.5 million 
abortions a year that we have.  That is what is generating 
all this energy and excitement and growth in the Republican 
Party, and I hope the people at the top of the Republican 
Party understand that that is where all the new blood in the 
party is coming from. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But if you think about where we have 
come on Vice Presidential selections; I mean, rumors of 
Colin Powell and Christine Todd Whitman, and now Jack Kemp 
is the selection --

<p>

MR. BAUER: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  -- what do you think was the impact 
that a lot of these pro-family Americans had on that 
pendulum swing? 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I actually heard through the 
grapevine that the Dole campaign did some polling of 
delegations before they got to San Diego and discovered that 
they would have a major problem on their hands at this 
convention if they had gone with a pro-abortion running mate.

<p>

So you are right; we went from a point six or 
eight weeks ago where literally almost every name on the 
list was pro-abortion and from the more liberal wing of the 
party to the point where, I think, over the last 10 days, 
even before the Kemp selection, almost every name was pro-
life and pro-family.  Whether it was Senator Nickles or 
Senator Mack of Florida, Governor Engler, or Jack Kemp, the 
ultimate choice, every trend line within the Republican 
Party is in a pro-life, pro-family direction. 

<p>

We saw it again just recently in the three Senate 
primaries in Georgia, Kansas, and Michigan.  I think we are 
going to see it this November in races all over the country.  
We saw it two years ago in the congressional races, where 
every pro-life incumbent won and no pro-life challenger lost.

<p>

So I think the trend line is pretty clear.  I am 
glad that Christine Todd Whitman and Colin Powell and 
Governor Wilson find other parts of the Republican agenda 
compelling enough that they want to be Republicans, but I 
think they are going to have to content themselves to be in 
a party that is pro-family and pro-life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to see throughout the 
show, Gary, some of the scenes from San Diego.  But what do 
you think the untold story is that our viewers may not know 
about what has been happening here in the last two weeks? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think the untold story at this 
convention is the one that we have already talked about.  
There is a lot of cynicism in the media about people being 
turned off on politics, that nobody trusts the system 
anymore, and yet here there are literally several thousand 
people, most of whom are new to politics, just getting 
involved at the grassroots level. 

<p>

Time and time again, they came up to me and said, 
"I'm just starting.  This isn't a one shot for me.  I'm 
going to be in this four years from now and eight years from 
now."  That's exciting.  That's good for American democracy 
and good for America and good for the Republican Party. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, as we have gone from place to 
place throughout the convention and the platform hearing, we 
have seen crowds form, instantaneous news conferences, a 
tremendous outpouring of public support.  We are going to 
show some of that throughout the show. 

<p>

One reporter called it Christian Woodstock, 
watching the kind of reaction of people to you as you have 
come here to the platform.  What is your response to this 
incredible outpouring of really affection and interest in 
what you're doing? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, it's humbling, actually.  I 
mean, I am flattered by it and pleased by it.  But whatever 
I do in Washington, I am able to do only because I have the 
proxy of all these folks that have been coming up to us this 
week.  And so my hat goes off to them rather than them 
thinking that I am the important person in this movement.  
They are the important people, and I am just trying to speak 
for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, take a look at the next four 
years and the next eight years.  Where is the balance of 
power going to lie between the economics and the social 
issues, and how will they work together? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think that a Republican Party that 
will be at its peak effectiveness will be a Republican Party 
where the economic issues and the social issues are seen as 
being equal -- equal of attention, equal of energy, et 
cetera.  And when the Republican Party really finds its 
voice, not only on the need for economic reform and lower 
taxes but also on the issues of cultural renewal and the 
respect for life, then I think it's going to be an extremely 
difficult party for anyone to overcome and anybody to 
dislodge as the majority party in the United States.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we are bringing you more pro-family 
highlights from the convention.  Let's take a look. 

<p>

[Clips from convention and related events follow:]

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  Well, I think the families 
of America have a great ticket, they have a great platform, 
and now they've got a great party.  It's called the 
Republican Party. 

<p>

[Segment from Tribute to Patrick J. Buchanan,
Escondido, California, August 11, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. BUCHANAN: Friends, what are we doing to our 
own people?  During this campaign, I went down to a tiny
town in Louisiana, central Louisiana in the bayou country.
It is called Rayne, Louisiana.  I went there because I had
just heard that a Fruit of the Loom plant was shutting down.
The plant had been built in 1992.  And so I went outside 
that plant where 600 women worked, and they were bewildered, 
and some of them were crying, and they didn't know what 
happened, because the plant was brand new, and they were 
making $6 an hour, and they were told that the plant was 
being shut down and one just like it was opening up in 
Mexico.

<p>

So, you know, in Washington, the think-tank 
scholars, foundation-fed, will get up and tell you, "These 
are sunset industries, these are dead-end jobs.  Let them 
all go."  But to those women of Rayne, Louisiana, those $6-
an-hour jobs were how they were raising their kids.  They 
were the best jobs they ever had, and they are not going to 
be making computers when they lose those jobs; they're going 
to be on welfare and they're going to be on unemployment. 

<p>

Across America, company towns are becoming ghost 
towns.  Behind this surface prosperity, families are being 
uprooted, forced to move out to find new work.  Young women 
who want to stay at home with their preschool children are 
being forced into the labor market to make the money to keep 
up the family's standard of living. 

<p>

You know, I am a conservative.  I have been a 
conservative all my life.  But if preserving and protecting 
neighborhoods, families, and communities, if conservatives 
aren't doing that, what is it we conservatives are trying to 
conserve? 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Friends, either we Americans go forward together 
or we are not going forward at all.  The American people are 
crying for deliverance.  Let us join forces with men and 
women of all parties to clean up our politics.  Let's put an 
end to all corporate contributions to political parties and 
all PAC payoffs that have put America the beautiful on an 
auction block and corrupted the democratic politics of the 
greatest republic on Earth.  Let us put an end to it all, my 
friends. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We need a party that not only preaches but 
practices a conservatism of the heart, that looks out for 
all of our people, but especially for those who have no one 
else to look out for them and no one else to speak out for 
them. 

<p>

Friends, we are in the process; the job is not 
done of making the Republican Party that kind of party 
again.  When no one else dared, back in 1991, we walked off 
a little TV show and challenged the President of the United 
States.  Look how far we have come. 

<p>

Read that party platform of 1996.  Whole sections 
that stand for life, protecting our borders, immigration 
reform, economic patriotism, fair trade, equal justice under 
law, restoring America's lost sovereignty, and putting 
America first.  They are right out of the speeches of Pat 
Buchanan, speeches we have been giving for 18 months. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I know and I have heard the sentiments in this 
hall tonight, and I respect them, and I appreciate them. I
think I know they are born of love for our cause and 
affection and love for me and Shelly.

<p>

But, you know, the other night -- I have been 
thinking and praying over this, and something came to me 
from the grammar school history books of my childhood.  In 
the Middle Ages, there was something they called the Truce 
of God.  During the 40 days of Lent, the warring nobles and 
knights of the kings, they suspended their battles with one 
another, and there was no fighting during Lent.

<p>

I believe that today this disputaceous and, yes, 
divided party of ours needs such a truce, a temporary truce, 
a truce of San Diego.  Let us, at least for the next 10 
weeks, nobles and knights and even peasants with pitchforks, 
suspend our battles with one another and join together in a 
common cause to defeat Bill Clinton and Prince Albert.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we are bringing you more pro-family 
highlights from the convention. 

<p>

[Segments from the convention follow:]

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  We are really impressed.
We, of course, are very excited by the announcement that 
Jack Kemp will be on the ticket, and we think, frankly, it 
has been a shot in the arm that the Republicans have needed, 
and we're looking forward to great things as a result. 

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  The party now has a platform 
[unintelligible] for open opportunity, low taxes, higher 
economic growth, higher standard of living. 

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  Well, I'm excited about the 
prospects coming up in November.  I think we're going to do 
very well in the House and the Senate, and I think that 
there's now -- people are very optimistic about our chances 
of winning the White House as well. 

<p>

[Segment from Pro-Family Briefing, August 12, 1996, follows:]

<p>

AMBASSADOR ALAN KEYES: We have, I believe, to 
stand before the American people in order to represent what 
we believe to be true about the heart of this nation's 
identity.  There are issues that go to that heart, and we 
must speak to them with integrity, and we must understand 
the priorities implied by that integrity, or two things will 
be true:  first, we will not win; and second, we will not 
deserve to win.

<p>

And I know that's hard for folks to understand 
right now, because in the midst of all of the things that we 
do with victory in mind, we sometimes forget that victory is 
not our purpose.  It is the result of serving our purpose 
well.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When I fought against the Communists during the 
course of the 1980s in the Reagan years, it was my 
understanding that one of the reasons we fought them was 
that they were people who believed that the end justified 
the means; that it did not matter what moral principles you 
violated so long as, in the end, your partisan cause, 
whether in a country or in the world, was triumphant. 

<p>

This cannot be the Republican way.  It cannot be 
the American way, or the battle we fought in the 1980s will 
be meaningless. 

<p>

Now, why have I said all of that?  I say all of it 
because it is true.  I, along with others, want and have 
worked very hard to make sure that the appeal of the 
Republican Party would be as broad as possible in terms of 
the kind of formal groupings that the media and others try 
to impose on us:  Are we going to attract enough Hispanics 
and enough blacks and enough women and enough other 
divisions to our division to make it the majority division? 

<p>

This is important, except that those groupings are 
all wrong.  In the end, human beings are not fundamentally 
divided on the basis of these superficial differences.  We 
are fundamentally divided, most importantly of all, on the 
ground of what we think is right and what we think is wrong.  
That is the true division. 

<p>

And that determines, or ought to determine, our 
priority as individuals and as a party.  If it does not, 
then our ambition has corrupted our purpose, and even if 
that ambition succeeds, the corruption will fail. 

<p>

I think that is very important here in this room.  
I presume you're here because of your commitment to the 
necessity of addressing the issues that affect our moral 
character and moral life. 

<p>

We are being told these days that that is one 
special-interest group among many.  But I don't believe it 
is, because these issues are the heart of the matter.  When 
the nation was founded, it was founded on the basis of moral 
principle. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When we went forward in the face of the wars and 
the adversities, starting with the Revolutionary War, what 
inspired and encouraged our people was that commitment to 
moral principle, that sense that as a nation we not only 
stood for something that would be successful -- see, this is 
what everyone wanted us to believe is the optimistic view of 
the American future:  We are optimistic because we're going 
to achieve success. 

<p>

But in the end, success is an empty word unless we 
know the standard by which that success is to be measured, 
and I think that success for America has to mean what it 
meant in the beginning, that we hold these truths to be 
self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, 
and that that phrase is not just a statement of abstract 
principle; it is the definition of liberty.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And if we abandon that definition, then in the end 
our success will be no success at all. 

<p>

And the cause that brings us together, the cause 
of the family, the cause of our defense of life, these look 
like discrete causes(?), but they're not.  In the end, there 
is only one principle at work here:  either we accept that 
first definition of our liberty, which sees it as a gift 
from the hand of God dependent on our respect for His 
authority, His will, His standards, His law, or we do not. 

<p>

And I think that for all the polls -- I see polls.
This morning I was reading a poll about abortion, and the 
footnote in the USA Today thing was, you know, the vote 5 to 
4 in the Casey(?) decision seems to have achieved what all 
of these parties cannot.  It has gotten to the position 
where the majority of the American people are, according to 
our poll, and that is a position that is a little bit this 
way and a little bit that way about abortion, doesn't treat 
it as an issue of principle.

<p>

But haven't we in our history learned that there 
are certain issues that do not depend on majority vote, that 
there are certain issues that cannot depend on majority 
rule?  And was it not the wisdom of the founder of the 
Republican Party that there are times in history when you 
must stand for those principles regardless of what may seem 
to be the majority opinion, because the purpose of 
leadership is not merely to be the puppet of every majority 
whim; it is, rather, to be the representatives of those 
principles by virtue of which the majority assumes the right 
to rule, by virtue of which every individual assumes the 
right to demand respect for their vote and for their consent.

<p>

And the principles that we champion and defend in 
the cause of the unborn are not only the principles of 
respect for innocent life in every particular case; they are 
the principles of respect for that truth that the source of 
human rights is not a human decision.  It is not the 
mother's choice; it is not the Constitution's words; it is 
not the Supreme Court's decision.  The source of human 
rights is a will beyond our will, a choice beyond our 
choice, and we must respect that or lose all sense of right.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Everything else we do, by the way, flows from 
that.  That includes our economic agenda.  When people stand 
in front of us as they sometimes try to do and they say, 
"Well, you've got fiscal conservatives and moral 
conservatives; they're at odds with each other."  Not in 
principle, because if I believe that by respecting So-and-So's 
right to control his $100,000, I am going to have to 
conclude that they have the right to own slaves and build 
death camps, is that understanding of individual rights 
accepted? 

<p>

See, we are not a party that believes in the 
untrammeled promotion of selfish interests.  We are 
committed to respect for individual rights because we 
believe in the capacity of human beings for moral choice and 
moral responsibility. 

<p>

And, therefore, we must be committed to doing 
those things and sustaining those things that build up that 
capacity for moral responsibility.  An educational system 
that understands that the ground of decent education is 
motivated and grounded in morality, and an economic system 
that understands that the ground of risk-taking and 
initiative and all of the things that are needed to sustain 
the free enterprise system we are dedicated to is a moral 
character capable of self-discipline and self-control and an 
individual will that acknowledges that there are limits to 
individual choice that come first in our responsibilities 
toward our children, toward our spouse, toward our 
community. 

<p>

This, I know, is what we all profess to believe.  
I hear it all the time.  During the course of my little 
campaign, even now as I walk the halls of this convention, 
everyone acknowledges this is what we believe. 

<p>

You will not hear this articulated from the podium 
at this convention, because the connection between our 
economic hopes and our moral identity is being denied here.  
But it is the truth of our Republican creed.  And regardless 
of what the consequences are for the moment, those who truly 
believe in that creed will have to stand for it, come what 
may. 

<p>

I am put in mind of the fact that Ronald Reagan 
spent 20 years in the American political wilderness 
championing what was right before, in the 1980 election, he 
finally was able to achieve success.  He stored up all that 
integrity so that, at a moment of our great international 
crisis, it would be there in reserve. 

<p>

Some of us still have to store up the integrity of 
this nation's truth, and in the moment of our real crisis, 
which is coming, which has come, it will be there in reserve.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More pro-family highlights from the 
GOP convention in just a moment.  Please stay tuned. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to a look at more pro-family 
highlights from San Diego, California, and <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Segment from Republican National Coalition for 
Life's "A Whale of a Party," August 13, 1996, follows:] 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  For millions of Americans, life is not 
about judicial decisions and executive decrees in 
Washington.  It's helping hands and good neighbors.  It's 
nighttime prayers and lovingly packed lunch boxes.  It's 
hard work and a little put away for the future. 

<p>

Those are the things you believed in.  Those are 
the things the American people, even in 1996, believe in.
Fight for those things.  Teach your children about those
things.  And if you do that, we will have this meeting again 
on the floor of the Republican convention in the year 2000. 

<p>

God bless you all.  Thank you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MRS. BEVERLY LA HAYE:  You know, we're really the 
pro-life world right here.  You are the men and women of 
America that really count and will make a difference.  We 
dare not let our voice be silent; we must speak out. 

<p>

PARTICIPANT: -- three leaders who have brought 
the pro-life cause to the national audience through the 
Presidential debates. 

<p>

MR. BUCHANAN:  The platform of the Republican 
Party reflects the views and values of right to life all the 
way, and that's our victory.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES:  I believe that it is essential, 
given the evil that we fight, that we come together and 
unite, dwelling not so much upon our failings, our foibles, 
our inadequacies, as upon the fact that however hard the 
journey was, however great the temptations may have been, 
the Republican Party at this convention has reached the 
right conclusion, we have made the right choices, and we go 
forward now to represent once again the right alternatives 
for this great nation. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE DORNAN:  All of you remember 
Clinton, on the disgraceful day, 20th anniversary of Roe v. 
Wade, Phyllis and I and some of you and Gary Bauer were all 
out on the Ellipse.  He looks through the window at us and 
signs five executive orders, death orders, what Billy Graham 
and the Pope and Mother Teresa called the culture of death, 
five executive death orders:  RU 486, human pesticide; what 
Chris fights on, the Chiro(?) policy crushing the Mexico 
City policy.  It went on and on.

<p>

One has been reversed; four to go.  The one that 
is reversed, with your help, with Chris speaking on the 
floor with me, and Henry, no abortions in military 
hospitals. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I won it last year.  I held the line this year.
One down, four to go.  God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE DORNAN: Here we are.  That's 
pretty good.  Hey, William, look up here, buddy.  Come on,
Molly, look around here.  There we are.  Here's all my gang.
This is why I'm for life.  Any questions?  There it is. 

<p>

[Segment from Christian Coalition's Faith and 
Freedom Celebration, August 14, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. RALPH REED:  We are to proclaim loud and clear 
that this country was made great not by taxing and spending 
bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., but by faith in God and the 
traditional family. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And in case you haven't heard it from the podium 
the last two days, let me say it so that there can be no 
doubt:  the Republican Party is a pro-life party, and as 
long as we're here, it always will be. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We are inclusive.  We are open.  We exclude no 
one.  But lest there be any doubt, we will never walk away 
from the innocent sanctity of human life in the mother's womb.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I have in my hand your 1996 Republican platform.  
There have been some this week that have said they haven't 
read the platform yet.  I don't intend on reading the whole 
thing this morning, but let me just go through a few of the 
things that are in here that this ticket and this party 
stand for. 

<p>

First of all, this platform calls for a human life 
amendment to protect all innocent human life:  born, aged, 
disabled, infirm, and elderly.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for a constitutional amendment to ensure 
that every single child in America has the same right that 
every member of Congress and every member of the Supreme 
Court has, and that is to be able to bow their head and 
begin their day with prayer in the public schools. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for a massive, $500-per-child tax cut, 
the largest tax cut in history directed at the family, to 
strengthen the most successful department of health, 
education, and welfare ever conceived, and that's the two-parent, 
intact family. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for returning control of education to 
parents and families, where it belongs, and abolishing 
outcome-based education, Goals 2000, and the Department of 
Education. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And it calls for not one more dime to go to 
Planned Parenthood to use our tax dollars to take the lives 
of unborn children. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

You know, to those who say that religious 
conservatives are an albatross hanging around the neck of 
the Republican Party, let me remind them of something.  This 
party was founded not simply to balance the budget, not 
simply to cut taxes.  It is not just a party of accountants.
This party, unique among all political parties in the 
history of Western civilization, was founded to right a 
wrong, to combat an evil, and to remove the stain of the sin 
of slavery from this land.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And just as it once stood for those who had been 
left behind who were of a different color and a different 
ethnic background, today it must stand for other 
marginalized people:  it must stand for the unborn; it must 
stand for the minority adolescent in the inner city who is 
walking through a metal detector into a school that is a war 
zone.  We must be a voice for the voiceless and a defender 
for the defenseless.  That's our mission. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More pro-family highlights coming up 
in just a moment.  Please keep watching. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from U.S. Taxpayers Party National 
Convention Platform Hearing, August 15, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I want to start by just reading some 
copy that the Family Research Council had in an ad that we 
ran in the <i>Washington Post</i> about the Defense of Marriage 
Act.

<p>

As you know, in Hawaii, the Hawaii court could 
rule that a marriage of two men or two women is a marriage, 
and we have been very aggressive in fighting this.  This is 
the way that we began our conversation on the issue: 

<p>

"The institution of marriage was built to last.
It was made in heaven, recognized by the state, sanctioned 
by faith, and honored by the community.  It has gone hand in 
hand with the rise of civilization.  Marriage has survived 
Marxism, outlasted free love, outlived Woodstock, toughed 
out the Playboy philosophy, and even endured radical 
feminism." 

<p>

As one of six children from a large and boisterous 
extended family, I understand that family is more than a 
word.  You know, it's joyful; it's a great experience.  But 
it is concrete. 

<p>

Family is that unit which is bound by marriage, by 
blood, by birth, and by adoption.  It is not a fill-in-the-blank 
phenomenon.  It is not something that we define based 
on the way that we feel today and not tomorrow.  It is a 
firm foundation for raising the next generation, and it is 
specific, concrete, and has long-lasting benefits. 

<p>

The reason why our government recognizes family is 
not because the founding fathers were a well-organized 
interest group and were very effective in institutionalizing 
their world view until, thank God, you know, the homosexuals 
of log cabin came along to enlighten us, and I say that 
facetiously, of course. 

<p>

Family has created the world in which we all 
survive.  In the same way in which water is a bond of 
hydrogen and oxygen, and it creates something that has a 
unique and specific life-giving value to everyone, marriage 
is the union of a man and a woman.  And if we call every 
fluid water, that does not mean that everything you drink is 
going to have the same benefit.  And if we call every 
relationship marriage, we do not create the same foundation 
for our children, and we can bring the same poison into our 
society by pretending that all things are created equal if 
we pretend that they are.  Marriage is specific. 

<p>

That is one of the things that we're fighting and 
one of the things that we have to actually worry about 
today.  I marvel at the fact that in my 10 years in 
Washington, we go from talking about whether or not we 
should do more for the family to whether we even know what 
family is at all, and that we actually have to fight this.  
It's a chilling circumstance today. 

<p>

The Family Research Council was created to be a 
voice for the family at the federal level, and I presented 
to the Taxpayers Committee a whole family catalog of 25 
platform positions.  But I just want to kind of go through 
some touch points on things that we consider critically 
important at the Family Research Council. 

<p>

The American family is in crisis, and government 
cannot solve all the crises of the family.  But it can take 
positive steps to restore the integrity of the family and 
its vitality.  We can oppose the marriage penalty in which 
it is more financially profitable for us to live together 
rather than to marry, and under the Clinton Administration, 
that marriage penalty has increased. 

<p>

It is an overtaxed family that we are seeing 
today, and we have commended the 104th Congress for 
supporting a $500-per-child tax credit.  In fact, if the tax 
credit per child had kept pace with inflation, rather than 
the $2,500 that you have today, it would be about $9,200.  
And, ironically, when Bill Clinton was a governor, he was 
part of a national family coalition that said, Gee, we need 
a $1,000 tax credit; and the $500 one is still hard-fought 
and not yet won. 

<p>

Forty years ago, the average American family spent 
one in 50 dollars in taxes.  Today it is one in four.  And 
the second earner in a family, normally it covers about 30 
percent of the overall budget, which is exactly the kind of 
income that Uncle Sam is taking home.  We have a nation 
today in which one member of the family works for the 
government and one member of the family works to support the 
family.  And that's pathetic.  That's absolutely pathetic. 

<p>

We are not talking about women who say that they 
want to work or women who have -- I am sure we all remember 
that the Proverbs 31 woman had a thriving real estate 
business and was managing to trade with the merchant ships.  
You know, it is not a matter of saying we think that women 
should not be involved in their community.  What we are 
saying is that, statistically speaking, the vast majority of 
women would prefer to stay home when their children are 
young and cannot afford it because Uncle Sam has a voracious 
appetite for their funds, and we need to cut him off.  He 
needs to get a job. 

<p>

[Laughter and applause.]

<p>

One of the places that we can turn to on that 
front is welfare.  We believe that the failure to form 
stable families is at the heart of the welfare crisis, and 
we have in fact instituted a system which pays you not to 
name the father of your child, not to marry the father of 
your child, not to save any money, and not to work.  And if 
you manage to do these four things, yes, there's a raise in 
it for you.  And if you have another child, more money is on 
the way. 

<p>

We have created a series of disincentives that is 
destroying people, and I know that is not news to you.  The 
Family Research Council, among the policy that is supported, 
has been in favor of the family cap, and a lot of people 
have talked about this as a cruel thing.  But let us be 
honest.  We have created an incentive for you not to marry 
and for you to have more children as the best way to ensure 
that you see a raise in your income. 

<p>

My husband and I, as we contemplate our own 
family, know full well that, much as Family Research 
Council, I am sure, loves me, I don't think Gary is going to 
give me a raise every time I have a new child. 

<p>

Every family has to make its own decisions, and 
that is the strengthening process of family, people working 
together to survive, and we have destroyed families by 
pretending like certain of us are so inept or so incapable 
or must be spoken down to in such a way that we will believe 
little of them but that they bear more children, that they 
have no self-control and no capability, when in fact they 
are very intelligent people.  They are making the only 
decision available to them in which their income is 
automatically guaranteed to go up. 

<p>

And so we see that welfare reform is key.  But the 
most important kind of welfare reform is that which gets the 
community involved with people. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We have to make our programs community-centered, 
church-centered, private initiative-centered.  We have to 
provide tax credits for those kinds of programs.  We can't 
be afraid to acknowledge that the most successful drug 
treatment programs are faith-based, that the most successful 
child care programs are faith-based, that the most 
successful alcohol programs are faith-based, that the best 
way to deal with out-of-wedlock pregnancy is faith-based. 

<p>

And instead, once again, we have a tremendous 
disincentive in our tax structure.  We're not going to help 
the people that are doing the job.  And you may have seen it 
in Texas.  There has been a lot of controversy over a drug 
program that actually works and got some money, some federal 
monies, and a very secular humanist set of lawyers went 
after them to take that money away because they actually 
mention God.  They actually mention God in the treatment of 
drug abuse. 

<p>

So, apparently, it's all right for us to have 
recidivism that leaves people dying in the streets, and it's 
not okay for us to get the community engaged in ways that we 
know will work. 

<p>

Welfare spending has increased from $57.6 billion 
in 1960 to $400 billion today.  We have gone during that 
period from 5.3 percent in out-of-wedlock births to 30.1 
percent in out-of-wedlock births.  We have gone from 22 
percent among African-Americans to 68.1 percent. 

<p>

You know, I believe frankly, I don't think we are 
hard-hearted, green-eyeshade people here -- I mean, I don't 
think anybody would have problems with a welfare state that 
was successful.  This is not a monetary discussion.  This is 
about true compassion.  And we are ruining people's lives 
with our federal dollars because we refuse to do the things 
that help them. 

<p>

We are not experimenting with "wedfare," in which 
we help people establish homes.  We are not allowing the 
church to get involved in matters of broken lives.  And 
isn't that what the church is for? 

<p>

Our goal has to be effective compassion and to get 
Uncle Sam out of the job as being the gluttonous middle-man.
On the critical moral issues of our day, we have got to have
the church involved in helping to solve our problems. 

<p>

But let us be clear that all of these programs and 
all of the tax benefits that we could think of are 
meaningless if we do not have life itself.  We hold these 
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal 
and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, and among those are life. 

<p>

We have got to appreciate the fact that we as a 
nation are funding, to the tune of some $245 million, the 
efforts of Planned Parenthood.  We are funding in the 
millions of dollars the U.N. conferences on the woman and on 
the child.  And we are spending millions and millions of 
dollars on condom handouts. 

<p>

I found it very ironic that my Federal Government 
made dancing condom ads.  I mean, at the very least, if 
you're going to allow such tasteless things to take place, 
can't they make them themselves?  Why am I forced to make 
these kinds of ridiculous and immoral ads and then pay for 
the air time to run them?  We are funding immorality. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Last week, we brought you some convention highlights,
Republican GOP convention highlights, from San Diego.  But 
there were a lot of pro-family events we didn't get a chance 
to show you, so please stay tuned for more convention 
highlights while we talk to you about what's going on Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>

[Segment from behind the scenes at the Republican National 
Convention follows:]

<p>

INTERVIEWER: This is Gary Bauer, president of the 
Family Research Council.  Mr. Bauer, first of all, I guess, 
a comment on everything preceding the convention.  We're 
kind of rolling, we're kind of all on one page, it seems 
like, but are you satisfied with what happened in the
platform hearings?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think a broadly conservative 
message is emerging from the convention.  Certainly the 
platform is a Reaganesque platform:  low taxes, small 
government, family values, respect for life.  Those are the 
key issues that I think we can get 51 percent of the 
American people to rally around.  It's what worked for 
Ronald Reagan, and if Bob Dole and Jack Kemp run on that 
platform, I think we'll have a real competitive race.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Are you convinced that they will run 
on that platform?  Are you convinced that they will take the 
social issues to the people?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I'm hoping that they'll spend a 
lot of time at this convention actually getting to meet 
real-live delegates and finding out what they think, instead 
of listening to all those high-paid Washington consultants 
that often tell politicians what they're supposed to do.

<p>

I think Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are both bright
men.  I certainly think they understand -- I hope they do --
that this is a new Republican Party that believes in family
values, and I think if they spend some time with these
delegates, they will realize that that's the ticket for this
campaign and those are the issues they ought to emphasize,
along with economic growth and lower taxes.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * </center>

<p>

[Segments from FRC booth area of convention follow:]

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Thank you. Appreciate everything 
you're doing for the country.  Take care.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Good to 
meet you both.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: . . . the party of Lincoln ought to be 
arguing for the protections of our Constitution for our 
unborn children.  That seems to me to be a good and right 
thing to do, even if occasionally the polls may show that 
most Americans are either confused about the issues or can't 
make up their minds.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Speaking of Dole, he had some 
critical remarks about you not too long back.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Right.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: How's the situation now?  Have you 
spoken with him since that time?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Only through intermediaries.  You 
know, Bob Dole is an opinionated guy, and so am I, and it's 
not unusual in Washington that you occasionally get into the 
ring with somebody and spar a little bit.  But at the end of 
the day, I think it's going to be a pretty united team, and 
I certainly don't have any ill will.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Dole's selection of Kemp.  Your comments about that?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, Jack's a personal friend of 
mine.  His daughter worked for me at the White House, so I 
guess I'm a little biased.  But he had a solid pro-life 
voting record when he was in Congress.  He brings the ticket 
some needed energy and optimism.

<p>

I suppose he is probably the biggest, most natural 
heir to the Reagan legacy.  So I think it's going to help a 
lot.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER [upon autographing a copy of his book, 
Our Hopes, Our Dreams]:  I hope they enjoy it.

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  They will.  Thanks a lot.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  It was really good to meet you.

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  Nice meeting you.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Thank you.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  . . . and our eight-year-old son says, 
"Because of our values."

<p>

MR. BAUER: Fantastic.  You're obviously already 
doing something real right at home.  That's fantastic.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  I think everybody will be leaving San 
Diego at the end of this week with a whole new situation.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

LADY:  . . . I really like Jack Kemp.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  He's a good man.

<p>

LADY:  Yes.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  He's a good man.

<p>

LADY:  He is.  Thank you very much.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  A lot of enthusiasm, which the ticket 
really needed.

<p>

LADY:  I know.  It really did.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  It's good to meet you, Gerri.

<p>

LADY:  Nice meeting you.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER [autographing his book]:  You said Richard?

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Richard.

<p>

LADY:  . . . really appreciate the fact that 
you're able to succinctly articulate the things we believe 
in.  It takes me half an hour to say what I want to say, and 
you say it so well.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be right back with more 
convention highlights here from San Diego, California.
Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we're bringing you some pro-family 
highlights of the GOP convention.  Let's take a look.

<p>

[Segment from Pro-Family Briefing held August 12, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. BAUER:  You know, for most American families, 
life isn't about executive decisions in Washington or 
judicial decrees and all the things in the headlines.  It's 
helping hands and good neighbors.  It's nighttime prayers 
and lovingly packed lunch boxes.  It's hard work and a 
little put away for the future.

<p>

This platform understands those things and stands 
for those things.  First of all, the platform has a solid 
commitment to economic growth and to economic opportunity.  
The platform writers understood that no American family has 
ever been held up by pulling another American family down.  
The platform writers knew that the idea is not to make the 
rich poor but to give the poor opportunity to accomplish 
everything that they can.

<p>

It calls for significant tax cuts across the board 
for all Americans.  It has specific tax cuts for American 
families with children.  Those are key points of differences 
between this ticket and the White House, and I think it will 
be a difference that will loom very large in this 
Presidential race.

<p>

The second key area in the platform is education 
reform.  The platform begins with the knowledge that parents 
are the first and most important teachers that a child has. 
It calls for a cutting back of the educational bureaucracy 
so that more of the money that the taxpayers give can get to 
the teachers and the children for whom it was intended.  And 
it makes a strong statement for educational choice so that 
all parents, not just suburban parents and well-off parents 
but inner city parents, can choose the schools they send 
their children to.

<p>

A third important area is the area of cultural 
renewal.  My hat goes off to Bob Dole for having the 
courage, in the last year or so, to take the message of 
cultural renewal to Hollywood and to say what all the 
American people instinctively know; that is that our culture 
in recent years has become debased, has emphasized violence 
and sexual exploitation, and that that culture is having an 
impact on our children.

<p>

Too many American families feel today as if they 
are surrounded by hostile territory, and this platform calls 
for a reinstitution of the idea of shame so that men and 
women that are making a fast buck, whether it's in Hollywood 
or Madison Avenue, will recognize their responsibilities as 
citizens to create a culture that is family-friendly.

<p>

And finally, this platform is, without shame or 
embarrassment, pro-life, and it should be, since this is the 
party of Abraham Lincoln.  Over 100 years ago, this party 
argued to the American people that the most defenseless 
members of our society then, African-American slaves, 
deserved the full protection and promise of our Declaration 
of Independence and Constitution; that they were in fact 
included in the words that said, "all men are created 
equal."

<p>

Today and over the last 20 years, the Republican 
Party has stood for the sanctity of human life, for the fact 
that today the most defenseless among us, our unborn 
children, are in fact included in those words, "all men are 
created equal."

<p>

I believe this platform is a noble and good 
platform, that it can inspire the American people to listen 
to the angels, the better angels of their nature, and I 
believe that if Bob Dole and Jack Kemp run on it, that we 
will all be at their inauguration in January 1997.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

SENATOR DON NICKLES: I want to thank everybody 
for their help, and I saw my friend Gary Bauer just spoke, 
and let me just say what a delight it has been to know and 
work with Gary and Family Research Council and other friends 
on really trying to help protect America's families.

<p>

I have heard lately Bill Clinton is talking about 
family values. I thought, well, wait a minute, is that Bill 
Bennett or is that Dan Quayle?  No, it's Bill Clinton.  One 
story did a kind of analysis that talked about the number of 
times he said "family values" and so on.  He mentions it now 
in his speeches. He knows it sells.

<p>

But, folks, you have to look to the facts.  Look 
at the history.  What about family values?  Bill Clinton's 
record doesn't comport with real family values.

<p>

You say, "What do you mean by that?"  Well, 
families are concerned about drug use.  And you look at the 
White House; they've been AWOL in the war on drugs, totally 
AWOL.  President Clinton takes off, he cuts off drug 
enforcement in the White House 80 percent.  Eighty percent. 
Makes jokes about, "Oh, well, yeah, I used -- well, I 
didn't break the drug laws of this country -- I did that in 
England -- and then I didn't inhale," and all this kind of 
cavalier attitude on drugs, and then we find out just 
recently, due to the fact that a couple of the FBI agents 
that were in charge of background investigations, that 
several people in the White House had used drugs fairly 
recently, some maybe as late as on inaugural day.

<p>

And yet this administration continues to push -- 
maybe that's the reason it took them so long.  They had over 
100 people that were a year late in having their FBI 
clearances done.

<p>

And then what did they do?  Well, they pulled out 
900 files of people who worked on cases years before in the 
Bush Administration, some even going back to the Reagan 
Administration, and they pulled out their files.  Why did 
they want to clear those files instead of the people that 
were working in the White House?  Those people had no reason 
whatsoever to be going into the White House, and this was 
for access purposes.  That's a real abuse of power.

<p>

And then you get into a real issue, too, and that 
is of character.  Who is telling the truth?  It bothers me. 
Mack McLarty -- I think very highly of the former chief of 
staff in the White House.  He said as recently, I think, or 
it just became public about eight or nine days ago that he 
was pressured into firing people in the travel office.

<p>

I remember David Watkins had a memo we found some 
time ago that said something about there would be hell to 
pay from Mrs. Clinton if they weren't fired.  Well, 
Mrs. Clinton said she didn't have anything to do with it.

<p>

Wait a minute. Truthfulness is an important 
family value. Family values are important.  Integrity is 
important. When you find people, either the President or 
Mrs. Clinton, not telling the truth, I think that undercuts 
family values. I think there is a real problem there, and 
we have seen scandal after scandal, almost a scandal a week, 
from this administration.  That undermines family values.  
That undermines discipline.

<p>

And then you look at some of the appointments this 
administration has, when they are talking about family 
values, and I remember leading the fight in the Senate 
against Dr. Elders, the surgeon general.  You know, if you 
believe in family values and then you look -- and no one can 
say that President Clinton didn't know Dr. Elders, because 
she came from Arkansas.  He appointed her originally in 
Arkansas, and then she was making comments, "Well, maybe we 
should legalize drugs."  He didn't fire her for that 
statement.  She made it once and then she made it again.  He 
didn't fire her again.  Finally he did fire her because she 
started talking about other things maybe even worse about 
what we should teach in school, and I didn't want Dr. Elders 
-- you know, she had one comment, "Well, we teach kids what 
to do in the front seat; maybe the government should teach 
them what to do in the back seat."  I don't want Dr. Elders 
teaching my kids what to do in the back seat.

<p>

But that's the kind of family values, and federal 
judges and so on, that you see that this administration has 
put in.  So their new allegiance to family values is 
rhetoric because some poster said we need to talk about 
this.  But it's not where their heart is.  It's not where 
they have been governing.

<p>

As a matter of fact, they don't have a surgeon 
general today.  They tried another one who was advocating 
abortion or had involvement in abortion, had actually 
performed them and so on -- he couldn't decide if it was one 
or 49 or 100 or what -- and so, well, now they just don't 
have one because they know it would be another hotly 
contested issue, my point being family issues are vitally 
important.  Families are the best level of government.  We 
need to protect the family structure.  We realize that when 
kids don't have two parents that those kids have a lot 
higher tendency to end up in trouble or on drugs or in 
broken families or maybe even in jail.  And so we owe it to 
America's society to protect American families, but this 
administration has almost declared war on families.

<p>

There is only one group that is really radical on 
abortion, and it's President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, and the 
Democrats.  They are the ones that vetoed a bill that 
passed, a bipartisan bill, overwhelming majority, that would 
have banned partial-birth abortion.  It's as close to 
infanticide as anything you'll ever find, and an 
overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate said, 
let's stop it.  Let's stop it.  It is about the only bill, I 
think, I have ever voted that would actually ban some 
abortions, and this President vetoed it, and he was wrong.

<p>

This President, too, has made a lot of statements.
He is the one that is in favor of funding abortions,
funding the termination -- funding and actually subsidizing 
the termination of innocent, unborn human beings. The 
Republican Party and most Republicans say we don't think we 
should subsidize; we don't think taxpayers should have to 
pay for that type of activity.

<p>

So there is a big difference, and people should be 
aware of it, and I am very proud of the fact that our party 
and the American people are saying, we want to stand and 
protect the lives of innocent children.

<p>

Some people say, "Is that banning all abortion?"  
No, it doesn't to do that.  We just don't think the Federal 
Government should pay for it, and we feel pretty strongly, 
and we think the American people, by an overwhelming 
majority, 80 percent or more, agree with us on that issue.

<p>

We also think states should be able to have the 
right to pass laws such as parental notification or parental 
consent, and this administration doesn't agree with that, 
either, and they happen to be wrong.

<p>

So I just want to compliment you for your efforts. 
I thank you for your efforts.  Let's work very, very hard 
and have a great victory in November.  Thank you very much.

<p>

[Applause.]

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to a look at the things 
you couldn't see on network television.  Let's take a look.

<p>

[Segment from National Federation of Republican 
Women's Salute to Elizabeth Dole follows:]

<p>

SENATOR DOLE:  . . . and I would just take a 
moment just to share a few memories that made a difference 
in my life.  It was the day we met.  It was on Tuesday, 
March 14, 1972.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Now, I am not one for horoscopes, but I brought 
the one along (from) that morning.  It's turning a little 
yellow, but otherwise it's all right.  And the horoscope 
said, and I quote:  "Find the right solution to governmental 
and other problems that face you."  End of quote.

<p>

[Laughter and applause.]

<p>

Well, at 11 o'clock that morning, the solution 
walked into my office.

<p>

[Laughter and extended applause.]

<p>

She was there with her boss, a great lady, 
Virginia Knauer, who had been alluded to before, for a 
meeting on consumer issues.

<p>

Now, normally, I don't like meetings -- normally.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But this was a pretty good meeting.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

It was so good, we're still meeting 24 years later.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I don't think Elizabeth knows this.  You don't 
surprise her very often, but I do have a little surprise for 
you, Elizabeth.  I initiated a search through the Senate 
archives last week and located the schedule for that week we 
met in 1972, and I brought it with me.  It says right here, 
"Eleven o'clock, Mrs. Virginia Knauer, appointment in Senate 
office.  If I have any questions, call Nora Joel(?), 
secretary, 456-2645."  I didn't have any questions before 
the meeting, but I had a number after the meeting.

<p>

[Laughter and extended applause.]

<p>

MS. BIZELL:  My name is Lisa Bizell, and I am 
somebody because of Elizabeth Hanford Dole and the Mary 
Cathy(?) Hanford Fund.  The Mary Cathy Hanford Fund was 
started by Mrs. Dole and her brother, John Hanford, as a way 
to honor their mother on her 90th birthday.  The fund has 
sponsored the Youth in Action group at the Elizabeth Hanford 
Dole Chapter of the American Red Cross in Salisbury, North 
Carolina, Mrs. Dole's home town.

<p>

Youth in Action is a program that helps teens 
develop self-esteem and learn more important skills like 
first aid, CPR, and HIV and AIDS prevention.  We also learn 
the importance of volunteering in our community.

<p>

I have been a part of Youth in Action for three 
years.  Everyone, like my family, my friends, and my 
teachers have said that being in Youth in Action has changed 
me, and I know that's true.  The things I've learned and the 
experiences I've had in Youth in Action changed my attitude, 
my willingness to accept responsibility, and my ability to 
work with others.  I have never been around so many people 
who really cared about what happens to me and my future.  
Thanks to those people, I am planning to continue my 
education by going to college.  Some day I hope to become a 
coach and teacher so I can help young people just as I have 
been helped.

<p>

I don't think Mrs. Dole realizes how many young 
people she has inspired.  All of us in Youth in Action look 
up to her, not because of the government positions she has 
held or the important people she knows but because of how 
she has shown that she cares about us.

<p>

Thank you, Mrs. Dole, for the difference you have 
made in my life and the lives of so many other young people, 
and you are the first lady to us.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<p>

ROBIN DOLE: . . . and just as Dad and Elizabeth's 
love has grown stronger throughout their marriage, so, too, 
has my friendship with Elizabeth.  I will always remember 
the first Mother's Day after they were married.  I dropped 
by with a bouquet of flowers for Elizabeth, and her eyes 
filled with tears as she realized the special role she would 
play in my life.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Elizabeth, you are very special to me.  I am proud 
to call you my stepmother and my friend, and it is my great 
honor to introduce to all of you the next First Lady of the 
United States of America, Elizabeth Dole.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MRS. DOLE:  Oh, my.  Thank you so much, and Robin, 
thank you so much for your beautiful, beautiful 
introduction.  That really touched my heart.  In fact, the 
whole program has been incredible.  I sat there with tears 
welling in my eyes, and this is just a day that I will 
cherish the rest of my life.  I don't deserve it, but I 
certainly appreciate it very, very much, everything that has 
been said and done today.  Bless you all.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

In speaking of women and opportunities for women, 
I recall especially at the Department of Transportation, 
when I was very new as Secretary, and I must tell you it is 
sort of male bastion, you know, because you are involved in 
highway construction and shipbuilding and air traffic 
control, and I said, "How many women do we have at the 
Department of Transportation?"  And they said, "Nineteen 
percent are female."

<p>

And I said -- now, this is 1983 -- I said, "When 
the Department was established in 1967, how many women were 
there?"  Do you know what the answer was?  Eighteen and a 
half percent.  We had come up half a percentage point from 
1967 to 1983.

<p>

So we decided to set up a program to help women 
enter the field, move up the ladder, and receive 
opportunities in this important area of transportation, 
because, frankly, a lot of the higher paying jobs in the 
private sector are in this area.

<p>

So Jenna(?) was the one who helped put the program 
together, and it may not sound like a lot.  We got the 
percentage up four percentage points while we were there.  
But when you have 100,000 people in your work force, that's 
a lot of women, so we were kind of proud of that record.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I knew we were making progress when a pilot told 
me one day, he said, "Mrs. Dole, the strangest thing 
happened.  I was flying into a major city, and there were 
three different voices on the air traffic control system, 
and all three were female."  And I said, "Right!  The 
program is working!"

[Segment from Christian Coalition's Faith and 
Freedom Celebration held August 14, 1996, follows:]

<p>

VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE: Do you remember several 
years ago, like 1992, where I made a speech about the 
American family and where I talked about too many of our 
children were being born into fatherless homes?  Bill 
Clinton said that my speech about the family and family 
values was divisive.  Well, today he gives that speech.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And, friends, it shows, if you have the courage of 
your convictions, if you're willing to stand firm for 
principle, if you're willing to stay in the kitchen and take 
the heat, if you're willing to stand up for the family and 
stand up for what is right, we will prevail.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CAPT. SCOTT O'GRADY:  I will have to tell you what 
Scott O'Grady thinks a hero is.  A hero is somebody who 
helps somebody else.  The only thing I was doing was 
surviving, saving myself.  But I'll let you in on something. 
It doesn't take a 19-year-old Marine to go out there under 
hostile fire to save somebody's life to be considered a 
hero.  Every single person here in America can be a hero 
when you help somebody else.

<p>

The reward doesn't come from being recognized.  It 
should come from within, knowing that you did the right 
thing.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE J.C. WATTS:  Let me tell you 
something.  There is nothing more in all the world that I 
enjoy and appreciate talking about more, and that is my 
faith and my relationship with the true and the living God.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And, friends, let me tell you something.  I don't 
apologize for it.  I don't apologize for it if I'm in the 
halls of Congress.  I don't apologize if I'm on the football 
field, on the basketball court.  I don't apologize for it.

<p>

Back in 1994, when I decided that I was going to 
run for Congress, a guy called me from Washington, D.C., a 
reporter, and he asked me, and he talked to me about a lot 
of different things, and he finally, after about 30 minutes, 
got around to asking me the $64,000 question.

<p>

He asked me, he said, "Well, Commissioner" -- I 
was a corporation commissioner at the time -- he said, 
"Commissioner, let me ask you, are you going to accept the 
help from the radical Christian right in your party?"

<p>

I said, "Sir, since you put it like that, I'm a 
Baptist minister, so I am the radical Christian right in my 
party."

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It's so amazing to me that you would think that 
the society wants the Christian community, the faith 
community, to just kind of stand on the sidelines and 
twiddle their thumbs while the nation goes to pot.  I say 
no.  We've got a role to play in this country.  We love our 
country just as much as anyone else.  And I say, Keep your 
chin up.  You fight the good fight, accept the challenge to 
go out and be the very best that we can be and sustain the 
greatness of being the greatest, the freest, most 
prosperous, most wonderful country on the face of the Earth.

<p>

God bless you, and let's go get 'em on November 5. 
Thank you very much.

<p>

<p>

REV. PAT ROBERTSON:  . . . but we're not going to 
rest until the time comes when, once again, we are proud of 
the occupant of the White House and not ashamed.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And we're not going to rest until once again 
America is that bright, shining light set on a hill, when it 
is considered the hope of freedom of all the nations of the 
Earth, when that Statue of Liberty is once again held high, 
without the stain that has been placed upon it by certain 
occupants from Arkansas and others that need to go home.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

But beyond that, we're going to see a time, my 
friends, and if we continue to work and this organization 
continues to grow and people of the grass roots continue to 
come out of their churches and out of their pews and into 
the polls and into the precincts and into the political 
process, we're going to see a time in America when once 
again it can be said, "There is America.  We give her to our 
children and our grandchildren, free, strong, proud, and 
truly one nation under God."

<p>

God bless all of you, and thank you.  God bless you.

<p>

HOUSE SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH:  There is a moral 
basis for lower taxes, and it is the belief that parents are 
superior to bureaucrats as the source of a family -- 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It is the belief that if you get up and you go out 
and you work, you have a legitimate first claim on your own 
money, and the government has to earn the right to raise any 
of your money in taxes.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And it is the belief that in a healthy, free 
society, if America has been good to you, you have an 
obligation to be good to your fellow Americans by reaching 
out a helping hand.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When liberals say compassion, they mean write a 
check to the IRS so they can hire a bureaucrat.  When we say 
compassion, we mean find a neighbor or a friend or a family 
member who needs help, and you help a person who needs help 
in a direct way.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And this morning, we went to two houses where 
Habitat for Humanity, working with the family, had helped 
build a house, and we said a prayer of dedication, and a 
family which had earned the ability to be buying their own 
home had the proud moment of knowing that they and their 
children would become homeowners and citizens and involved 
in their community.  And that, not the government 
bureaucracy, is the right way to help America.

<p>

MRS. KEMP:  We are so honored and excited to have 
been given this awesome responsibility.  We thank you for 
your help.  We solicit your prayers.  We are so thrilled as 
a family to be behind Bob Dole, and we thank you for your 
support that is going to make this ticket a winning one.

[Segments from Dole/Kemp Kick Off Rally held 
August 16, 1996, follow:]

<p>

ANNOUNCER:  . . . the next President and Vice 
President of the United States, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I have a couple of jerseys that I would like to 
present to the "Dream Team" -- the Dream Team.  I have to 
tell you, and I want to start off with our next Vice 
President, Jack Kemp.  Jack?  There you are, number 15.  I 
want you to know, we got number 15 . . . number 96 for 
Victory '96.   Victory '96, the Dream Team.

<p>

MR. KEMP: I'm thrilled to be on Bob Dole's ticket.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I want you to know, it is with great humility, 
awesome responsibility, incredible excitement, that Joanne 
and I and our family join the Dole team.  Let me say it 
again today in front of our friends in the press, in front 
of our San Diego family and in front of all those 
Republicans with whom we feel such comradeship, it ain't for 
the Republican Party, with all due respect.  This is for 
America.  Bob Dole wants this country to be restored and the 
dream of America for all people.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I've got to tell you, if I had known when 
Spanos(?) gave me this jersey with 15 on it that that was 
going to be the tax cut for America, I wish I was Jim Brown 
and was 32.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I'll tell you what.  Fifteen is the down 
payment on a new code for America that Bob Dole and I will 
design with the family in mind, with growth and opportunity 
as our goal, and with that equality of opportunity for which 
we as a party -- and Bob Dole spoke last night, too, that 
Lincoln founded the Republican Party in 1860 on one simple 
yet profound predicate:  that all men are created equal; 
that there is a Creator, and He created us equal, and there 
is only one system designed on this Earth to unleash the 
potential of the human spirit to which I talked, and Bob, 
last night.  I want you to know with all my heart that's 
what Kemp, that's what Bob Dole, Elizabeth, Joanne, and this 
whole team are all about.

<p>

I'll close with this thought.  You can imagine, as 
I said earlier, my emotions coming back to San Diego as a 
candidate for the Vice Presidency of the United States.  I 
want to thank Bob for saying in his speech last night, we do 
not look at the other party or those in power today as 
enemies.  They are opponents.  I learned on the football 
field that you can be a good opponent and walk off that 
field, shake hands, and be friends, and I can tell you, my 
best friends in professional football are not just my 
teammates but the guys who used to try to knock my head off 
on Sunday.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I respect that.  I respect that.  It is going to 
be tough, it is going to be long, it is going to be 
incredibly competitive.  And I will just say this to close, 
my second closing -- 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

The Democratic Party, bless their hearts, are not 
democratic.  They are elitist.  That party of Roosevelt and 
Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy has turned into a party 
that wants to run our lives, run your business, manage your 
farm, tell you where to send your children to school.  They 
want to control your money.  They think that if Bob Dole 
cuts their taxes, that it's taking away from the government.

<p>

We are not going to deny the government the 
resources it needs to do what Bob Dole talked about last 
night, to provide a net, a safety net, under which people 
will not be allowed to fall.  There is no man in America who 
cares more about the disabled, the left behind, low income, 
than Bob Dole.  I just want you to know we are going to save 
the net, make it stronger, but we are going to build a 
ladder of opportunity out of poverty upon which all American 
men and women can climb, and that is the Dole-Kemp message.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. DOLE:  I think I did accept the nomination 
last night, so I am proud to be your nominee for President 
of the United States.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

How many think I made a good pick in choosing Jack Kemp?

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And Joanne, too, of course.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Fifteen percent tax cut.  Keep that in mind.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Jack and Joanne have 4 children and 11 
grandchildren, 15.  Fifteen, keep that in mind.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And let me say to my friends -- I know the press 
may not be listening, but let me just say to my friends -- 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I didn't mean it that way.  I mean, I just want to 
tell you a little secret.

<p>

AUDIENCE:  It was an A-plus.

<p>

MR. DOLE:  All right.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

If I have anything at all in dealing with my 
colleagues in the Congress of the United States over the 
past many years, it has been credibility.  Democrats and 
Republicans -- the Democrats may have to take a little leave 
of absence here for a while -- but I would not propose a tax 
cut, and I would have not proposed the economic package had 
I not been certain that we could achieve it without hurting 
social security, without hurting Medicare.

<p>

But I really believe that we have an obligation to 
families with children and taxpayers all across America to 
make our tax code flatter and fairer and simpler, and we're 
going to get the job done.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

So we're excited.  I said when I arrived in San 
Diego it was getting exciting, and Elizabeth said, "Well, 
it's about time."

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And I'm now leaving full of excitement and full of 
enthusiasm and full of confidence.

<p>

I did call President Reagan yesterday about 4 
o'clock.  When I got him on the phone, I said, "Mr. 
President, tonight I will give my acceptance speech, and I 
want to say as I do that I have talked to you, and that out 
of great respect from all Americans for you, Mr. President, 
I want to be able to say that we're going to win because we 
have the right agenda, because we are the party of ideas, 
and because we want to complete the Reagan revolution."

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And he said, "That's fine."

<p>

And then I said to him what a great job Nancy 
Reagan had done in her tribute to him just two nights 
before.  And then Nancy came on the line and we had a good 
visit.

<p>

But the bottom line is, Ronald Reagan certainly 
was a man for his time.  He provided great leadership for 
all Americans regardless of party --

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

-- followed by my good friend, George Bush, who 
did the same and should have been reelected.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

So I want to make the same plea that Jack did.
When you go back home -- some of you are already home, but 
the message is the same.  Contact your neighbors, people you 
go to church with, people you go to service clubs with, 
people you work with, whether it is in the hotel, whether it 
is somewhere else.  Let them know about the Republican 
Party.  Let them know that we're looking ahead.

<p>

I see all these great young people here this 
morning.  That's the future of our party.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And if we don't keep our word, if you can't trust 
us, then throw us out.  But I trust the American people.  I 
believe you will trust us, and together we will make America 
a better place as we go into the next century.

<p>

Thank you.  God bless America.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I want to know why you're here, "Mr. President."

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  Apparently -- I don't 
know if you heard -- this is a late-breaking story -- but I 
believe the Republicans snuck into the White House and 
removed some personal effects, papers and things, from the 
top of the shredder in, I mean top of the file cabinet in 
Hillary's private quarters.  I don't know if you've seen 
this or not, but Hillary was never in Hanoi with Jane Fonda.
Never, ever was she in Hanoi with Jane Fonda.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of things were said, Mr. President.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  I was nowhere near 
Gary Hart and Miss Rice, Donna Rice -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I see.  It's all a lie.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: All a lie. And there 
is absolutely, positively no truth whatsoever to the rumor 
that Newt and I are in any way, shape, or form related, not 
even halfway.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I see.

<p>

Mr. President, what brings you to the Republican convention?

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: Well, what I'm trying 
to do is right this terrible injustice to myself and my 
administration and my family. I'm going to ask Bob Dole, 
Jack Kemp, and Newt Gingrich to 'fess up to this, basically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I see.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  And if need be, I will 
take it to the convention floor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Any thoughts about the fact that now 
they seem to be 9 points away from you instead of 20?

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  You know, any time you 
get somebody new on board, obviously, there's going to be a 
little bit of excitement.  And not only that; he's got nice 
hair.  We all know that the American public -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Nice hair sells.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  Nice hair sells.  So 
it'll wear off in a few weeks.  I'm not concerned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: Thank you very much. 
God bless you.  God bless America.  Don't forget, a party in 
the Presidential suite.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are taking a look at the 
Democratic National Convention and how the Democrats face 
the problems affecting American families.  We will talk 
about Family Research Council's role at the convention and 
how the pro-life and pro-family message plays to a key group 
within the Democratic Party.  You won't want to miss seeing 
some of these DNC highlights.

<p>

But first we bring you Robert Knight, FRC's 
director of cultural studies. Just yesterday, I spoke with
Bob about the historical Senate vote which protected 
marriage as it has been defined since the beginning of time:
as a union between one man and one woman.  In fact, the 
Family Research Council provided key information to those 
drafting the Defense of Marriage Act, also known as DOMA, 
and spearheaded an ad campaign to inform the public of the 
importance of protecting marriage.

<p>

Bob and I discussed the influence gay activists
asserted in their attempts to redefine marriage and to pass
a gay civil rights bill, also known as the Employment Non-Discrimination 
Act, or ENDA.  Let's hear what Bob had to say
as we bring you insights we're sure you didn't hear on the
national news, as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

As you well know, yesterday there were some very 
historic votes in the Senate, first on the Defense of 
Marriage Act and then on ENDA, the gay civil rights bill.  
It is amazing that we are talking about whether marriage is 
really a man and a woman.

<p>

We are going to talk in a couple moments about the 
implications of that, but first, could you tell us what was 
the chain of events that led us to actually debate what is 
marriage and how sex should be interjected in the workplace.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it all started several years 
ago in Hawaii when three homosexual couples came to the 
state and said, look, we want marriage licenses.  The state 
said no, you can't, because it is reserved for men and women 
together.  And they took their case to court, and it wound 
its way up to the Hawaiian Supreme Court, which sent it down 
to the lower court with instructions warning them that 
they're going to legalize same-sex unions as marriage if the
state can't find a compelling interest.

<p>

That case has wound its way back up to the 
Hawaiian circuit court level, where it began yesterday, on 
September 10.  That case could result in the legalization of 
gay marriage, so called.

<p>

Now, this presents a conflict for the rest of the 
states, because they are supposed to recognize each other's 
marriage licenses and driver's licenses, and so forth, under 
the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution.

<p>

And so people who are concerned about this being 
forced on other states drafted the Defense of Marriage Act 
at the federal level, which does two things.  It defines 
marriage as the union of a man and a woman as husband and 
wife, for federal purposes, because it is in the Federal 
Code hundreds of times -- you'd better know what it means -- 
and it gives the states protection against being forced by 
the Full Faith and Credit Clause from having their marriage 
laws radically redefined.

<p>

It doesn't impose a federal definition of 
marriage.  I mean, it would be nice if it did, but then 
again, that's not really the Federal Government's role.  But 
the Federal Government does have a role under the Full Faith 
and Credit Clause.  Congress is ordered to interpret the use 
of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

<p>

So this is entirely constitutional, and it is
necessary, because gay activists have said they plan to fly
couples from the 50 states to Honolulu, get the marriage
licenses, come back, and raise the issue in the courts. So
we needed this kind of protection.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the Defense of Marriage Act is an 
attempt to stop what the gay activists have said that they 
are going to do, which is break down the definition of 
marriage and the institution of marriage in all the 50 
states by forcing it through the courts rather than 
legislatively.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, exactly, and some of the gay 
activists have been very candid about this.  Michelangelo
Cignorilli(?), who writes for the <i>New York Times</i>
periodically, wrote in <i>Out</i> magazine that same-sex marriage 
-- quote, unquote -- was the final tool to get rid of the
rest of the sodomy laws -- and there are sodomy laws in 18
states -- teach children about homosexuality in the public
schools, and, in short, usher in a sea change about how the
public views homosexuality.

<p>

He also said gay activists should acquire "same-sex 
marriage" not as a way of living up to society's moral 
codes but as a way to destroy this "archaic institution" 
which, as it is, "serves to keep us down."  In other words, 
it's not about two people yearning to get a marriage license 
out there; it's about an organized group of very well-heeled, 
very aggressive homosexual activists who are trying 
to use marriage as a weapon in a larger struggle, which is 
to force society to affirm homosexuality as good and normal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you know, Bob, the polling 
numbers on marriage and support for the Defense of Marriage 
Act have risen volcanically.  In Hawaii, which is a liberal 
state, you've got numbers now close to 80 -- they have risen 
about 15 points or so -- and nationwide above 80 percent in 
favor of defense of marriage.

<p>

And so you take this really popular bill, and 
we've seen some gutting techniques and amendments added, in 
particular from Senator Kennedy.  Could you tell us a little 
bit about that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. This was interesting, the way 
the gay activists saw this coming as a steamroller and said, 
well, we have to throw something in front of it.  They got 
Senator Ted Kennedy to throw the Employment Non-
Discrimination Act in front of it, and that is what we call 
the gay jobs bill. It would be an historic restructuring of 
civil rights, because it would add a behavioral component 
for the first time. Sexual orientation would acquire the 
same status as race, gender, and religious rights.  It has 
never been accorded that at the federal level.

<p>

So they hoped that this would be what we call in
Washington here a poison pill, where you attach something to
a bill you don't like, hoping that people won't swallow it,
and thus you kill the whole bill.

<p>

In negotiations with the Senate leadership, Trent 
Lott and Don Nickles, who is the chief sponsor of DOMA, they 
agreed to bring up four amendments on each side.  One of 
them was this gay jobs bill. When Senator Kennedy saw the
Republicans' amendments, he didn't like them, canceled the 
whole deal, and they ended up with a deal allowing a 
straight vote on DOMA and ENDA separately. That cleared the
way for a clean vote on DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that is a little 
confusing, I think, is whether or not the Defense of 
Marriage Act can be canceled out by the gay civil rights 
bill, ENDA. Is that possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: ENDA would apply only to workplaces.
So it really wouldn't affect the marriage law that much.
What it would do is send a signal that the Republican-controlled 
Senate, in an election year, is talking about a 
national gay rights bill. I think the gays have to be happy 
about that, that they have gotten us to this point, that 
there hasn't been enough serious opposition among the 
leadership of the Republican Party, in particular -- because 
the Democratic Party is behind this -- and that is why it 
has become an issue.  If they had been steadfast, I don't 
think we ever would have seen this. We didn't even see this
under the Democratic Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to talk a couple of 
minutes, Bob, live about the implications of the two 
historic votes. But in terms of the gay civil rights bill,
would it inject sexuality into the workplace?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Right. It is supposed to reduce 
intolerance toward homosexuality and bisexuality; it is in 
the bill.  Actually, it would increase sexual tension in the 
workplace, because how would an employer know who is 
homosexual and who is not, unless the employee makes a point 
of it?  That has been the case all along.

<p>

I see a great threat to religious freedom, freedom 
of speech, freedom of association, because laws like this 
are not passed in a vacuum.  You've got the whole realm of 
sexual harassment laws to deal with that are kind of coupled 
to it.  What if a person has a Bible on his desk and a gay 
employee says, "Look, that book is homophobic and it says 
homosexuality is wrong.  That creates a hostile atmosphere 
to me, and I feel threatened."  What if the employer to do? 
Tell the guy to put the Bible away?  Now he's trampling on 
religious freedom.

<p>

How about the provision in ENDA which says there 
can be no consideration at all based on sexual orientation? 
So what if an employer prefers to hire a person that he 
thinks is morally straight, like a good boy scout would be? 
A homosexual would-be employee can say, "Well, you hired 
that person because he was heterosexual."  And the employer 
would say, "No, I didn't. I did it on qualification."  And 
the gay would-be employee will say, "Well, prove it."  And 
you could see where this can go. With a couple of activist 
lawyers and a couple of liberal judges, you've got a big gun 
aimed at American business' head.

<p>

So I cannot understand why more people who should 
know better don't see this as what it is, a massive 
expansion of federal power over America's workplaces.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Bob, we'll be back in just a 
couple moments to talk with you about the Defense of 
Marriage Act and the gay civil rights bill. Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are joined by Robert 
Knight, director of cultural studies for FRC.  Bob played a 
key role in relaying information pertinent to the Defense of 
Marriage Act and the gay civil rights bill.  Bob, thanks so 
much for being with us on the show.

<p>

Yesterday, before the vote, you and I were talking 
about how we got to this situation, the court case in 
Hawaii, in which arguments started yesterday, and all the 
different states getting concerned.  But now we've had the 
votes.  Why don't you quickly first tell us the results of 
the two votes, and then let's start talking implications.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, DOMA was a resounding victory.
The Defense of Marriage Act passed by a vote of 85-14.
There was one Senator missing, David Pryor, who was out of 
town because of a son's medical emergency.

<p>

What was most interesting, though, was the vote 
following that on what we call the gay jobs bill and Senator 
Kennedy calls the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.  What 
that act does is add sexual orientation to civil rights law 
in the workplace, therefore giving it the highest possible 
protection, right along with ethnicity or race.

<p>

We squeaked by.  They defeated ENDA by one vote, 
50 to 49.  Now, that's the first time the U.S. Senate has 
voted on a gay rights bill, and we just saw it go down by 
one vote, and I think that is very significant.  It shows 
that the homosexual activist lobby was very active in 
promoting that.  It is almost as if they gave up on DOMA 
because millions of people, frankly, were hammering the 
Senate on DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Calls and phone calls and letters 
and talk shows and -- 

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Oh, yes. Even many liberal -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of energy.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, a lot of energy on DOMA.  People 
just saw the threat to marriage and reacted.

<p>

ENDA wasn't on their radar screen.  It is almost 
as if the homosexuals did an end run.  In fact, ENDA 
originally was attached to DOMA as a killer amendment by 
Senate Kennedy, and then through a series of parliamentary 
maneuvers, it was stripped off DOMA so DOMA could have a 
clean vote.  But then the compromise that Kennedy extracted 
was to have a vote on ENDA straight up, which was 
unprecedented.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think one of the things that we 
have to mention is, even though the gay civil rights bill 
was defeated, Senator Pryor said that he intended to vote in 
favor of that, and in a 50-50 split, I think we have to 
anticipate that the Clinton Administration, with Vice 
President Al Gore having the tie-breaker, probably would 
have voted in favor of gay civil rights, given some of their 
other policies and their discussion of gay civil rights.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Every vote counted, and I 
didn't know whether ENDA would go through or not.  A very 
good sign was when Nancy Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican, 
took the floor against it.  She is not exactly a big 
opponent of gay rights; in fact, she prefaced her remarks 
saying, "Well, I support rights for gay people," and so 
forth.

<p>

But this bill would shackle businesses with 
another layer of federal regulation.  It would be an 
unprecedented intrusion into the workplace.  And it would 
interfere with the beliefs of millions of Americans.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have to jump on that for a 
second, because everyone understands in their workplace EEOC 
regulations, equal opportunity regulations, that say perhaps 
we need a percentage of so many women or so many of a 
certain minority, or we are looking at a community; we have 
to have this kind of mixture to legally qualify for federal 
grants or even to avoid prosecution.

<p>

So to take a look at something that talks about 
sex in civil rights legislation, doesn't that mean we would 
have to ask every person, "How do you have sex?" when they 
are hired?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, that would protect an employer,
I suppose, under ENDA.  ENDA has a non-quotas provision in 
it. They say specifically you cannot base quotas on sexual 
orientation.  But we have seen similar promises before in 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act when Hubert Humphrey said, "Don't 
worry, this won't lead to quotas."  And we know what 
happened.  We got racial quotas, we got gender quotas, we 
got the whole ball of wax.

<p>

You know what would happen.  Employers would try 
to find out the sexual orientation of their employees so 
they could be seen to be complying with the act.  Quotas 
follow civil rights laws as naturally as day follows night. 
It is the only way they can prove they are complying.

<p>

And, as you said, it would inject sex into the 
workplace.  Right now most employers really don't care if 
their employees are homosexual or not.  There really isn't 
this great problem. In fact, Ed Mickens(?), a writer for 
<i>The Advocate</i> magazine, a gay national magazine, wrote two 
years ago that gays aren't being fired from their jobs in a 
big way.  In fact, because the Cracker Barrel had fired a 
lesbian, the fact that it was so sensational pointed out the 
larger fact that it just isn't happening.  You have a case 
here or there, but there is no great national upsurge in 
rooting out homosexuals from their jobs.

<p>

And so they have manufactured this issue.  And had 
they prevailed, we are talking about a threat to religious 
freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of association.  How 
about a Christian employee who puts a Bible on his desk, and 
a guy in the office who maybe he didn't know was gay says, 
"You know, that's a homophobic book.  I feel threatened.  
You have created an atmosphere of sexual harassment here."

<p>

What is the poor employer to do?  If he tells the 
guy to take the Bible out, he is just trampling on religious 
freedom.  If he leaves the Bible in, the gay goes to the 
EEOC and says, "Hey, I feel put upon; I feel harassed."  I 
mean, this is a lawyer's dream, this kind of legislation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems that the only way that you 
can deal with it is to talk openly about it.  In the Sunday 
<i>New York Times</i>, there was a fascinating article on the front 
of the national section about people who cross-dress and 
bisexuals saying that they are not, to use a phrase, 
"straight homosexuals," where they are not just all guys or 
just all girls; they like to be a mixture of all, so that 
they need their own separate classification.

<p>

So we are going to have, I guess, straight 
straight and straight homosexual or lesbian and then people 
who cross-dress, and it seems like the checkoff for man, 
woman, minority, sexual, occupation, is going to be pretty 
intense.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it has got to be.  And the 
whole problem with sexual orientation is, it's in the mind. 
And the law concerns human actions, not thoughts.  This 
would be an unprecedented attempt to inject fortune-telling 
into the law.  I mean, how would you know what is in 
somebody's mind unless they tell you?

<p>

A friend of mine, Paul Mirro(?), who works for Bob 
Dornan, wrote a funny piece just yesterday called <i>My
Favorite Martian</i>. It's about an employer who sits down with 
an employee, a long-time employee, and the employee says to 
the employer, "I need to talk to you.  I have to tell you 
something."  He says, "I'm a Martian."

<p>

The employer says, "Well, I didn't know you were a 
Martian."  The employee says, "Well, I've kept it secret."
It goes into a parody, and he uses all the language the gay 
activists use.  When it comes down to it, the employer says,
"Well, since nothing you have done is Martian and I didn't 
know you were Martian, why are you making it evident to me?" 
The employee says, "Because I want to be recognized for 
what I am."

<p>

The employer says, "Well, then, aren't you 
imposing your Martianness on the rest of us?"  And the 
employee says, "Well, yeah, but why not?  What's wrong with 
being a Martian?"  And again, he could never nail down 
exactly what a Martian was.  He said his parents weren't 
Martians, but he just knew he was a Martian.  I knows this 
sounds silly, but it shows how silly the whole thing is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that has been 
discussed is whether or not the gay civil rights bill might 
be attached to an appropriations bill, whether we might see 
it one more time before this Congress leaves.  Senator 
Kennedy has been a real champion of it.  Do you think that 
is possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: It is possible. Our lobbyists have 
told us that there is scuttlebutt on the floor that they 
might try to attach it to another bill and hope Senator 
Pryor is back in town to break the tie.

<p>

I am not sure that is what the Clinton 
Administration would like to have happen, because then you 
would have Al Gore breaking the tie.  That would put the 
administration in a very visible position of supporting a 
gay rights bill on a national level.  They are already on 
record as doing so, but this would notch it up a few 
degrees.

<p>

I am not sure that any political campaign really 
wants to inject that element into a campaign.  The 
Republicans have been very quiet about it, and the Democrats 
haven't exactly made it a huge issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. The <i>Post</i> made a point this 
morning of talking about the rather subdued debate leading 
to a rather quick vote, which anyone who watches much C-SPAN 
knows that that is not very normal.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: No, it isn't. Both parties are 
uncomfortable with the issue.  They wanted to get it off 
their plates and on to other business, and they did do the 
right thing by rejecting ENDA and passing DOMA, in my 
estimation.

<p>

I think the DOMA victory should give a lot of 
people heart that there has been a realization that you can 
go too far.  You can knock at the stilts of civilization and 
perhaps bring it down, and this was a lot of Americans 
shoring up that foundation with DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So where do the bills go from now?
Obviously, one -- Senator Kennedy is saying that the gay 
civil rights bill he will probably just reintroduce next 
time.  Where does DOMA go?  It has been passed by the 
Senate.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: DOMA goes right to President 
Clinton's desk, and in the words of our president, Gary
Bauer, "President, eat your spinach and sign the bill."
And, of course, that is Gary's reference to the fact that he 
suspects that Bill Clinton doesn't really want to sign the 
bill, but he said he will, so he expects him to do so.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That was a real point that the 
Republicans made on the floor: If the President likes it, 
why wouldn't you be for it?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Well, I don't think everybody 
is believing that the President really likes it.  After all, 
the President was on record as supporting ENDA while it was 
attached as an amendment to DOMA in an effort to kill DOMA. 
So it is kind of, on one hand he is saying, "Okay, I'm for 
marriage"; on the other hand, "I'm for all these guys 
attaching these things that everybody says might kill it."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you say, Bob, to people who 
think that it is only a matter of simple fairness?  We heard 
that phrase: "It's a matter of simple justice and a matter 
of simple fairness." Do we want someone who is homosexual 
or lesbian to be fired from their job for being homosexual? 
It's a matter of simple fairness.  What is your response to 
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, I think the polls are very 
revealing.  If you frame it that way, "Do you think gays 
ought to be fired just for being gay?" almost nobody says 
yes, because in a vacuum like that, it sounds unfair; it 
sounds un-American.  And it probably is, depending on the 
job and how the sexuality was made manifest.  You know, a 
lot of these concepts sound great until you try them in the 
real world.

<p>

What ENDA would have done was, instead of leveling 
the playing field, it would have added an entirely new 
component.  It would have allowed gay employees or would-be 
employees an enormous ability to litigate against an 
employer if they didn't get what they wanted.  And it is not 
as if they are not a litigious group.  I mean, they've got 
suits against the boy scouts, they've got suits about sexual 
harassment, they've got gay lawyers hammering this issue all 
over the country.  They were licking their chops at the 
prospect of having a federal law in place that said you must 
take sexual orientation into account, basically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But would the research indicate that 
homosexuals and lesbians are being fired and that they are 
suffering economically because of the way in which they have 
sex?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: There is no evidence that that is 
happening. There are probably a handful of cases where 
employers have said, "I'm not comfortable with this 
behavior; you'd better work someplace else."  Depending on 
the situation, that might be okay, it might not.  What if 
it's a day camp?  What if it's the boy scouts?  What if it's 
an organization that deals with children?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. It is easy to see in a case 
recently in Virginia where a teacher was in pornographic, 
homosexual films, working as a gym teacher with young boys. 
When this information was revealed, he was fired.  And 
would he not have an actionable case under the gay civil 
rights bill to come back and say, "Hey, they fired me for my 
sexual practices"?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, that is right, because the term 
is "sexual orientation" in the law, and real or perceived. 
That's the way they define it:  homosexuality, bisexuality, 
heterosexuality, whether real or perceived.

<p>

He could say, "Well, look.  Because I was in a gay 
porn film, an ordinary person might conclude I'm homosexual. 
Therefore, I am being fired on an outside activity, 
unrelated to work, has nothing to do with my job as a 
teacher, but it's the perception that I'm homosexual, that's 
my orientation, and you're firing me."  I think he would 
have a case under ENDA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you go into the case, too, 
Bob, out of Canada where a mayor ran into an interesting 
circumstance, to help people understand how some of these 
things have broken out?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. The gays use the rhetoric of 
fairness:  gays just want to be left alone.  But I think the 
situation in an Ontario town, Hamilton, proves the opposite. 
The mayor was approached by gay rights groups and asked to 
create a gay pride week, and he said, "Well, this is a 
Catholic, blue-collar town.  I don't think so.  You know, I 
have nothing against you guys, but I'm not going to proclaim 
a pride in something most people think is wrong."

<p>

They hauled him before the Human Rights Commission 
in Ontario, and he was threatened with a fine of $5,000 
personally for hate-mongering and bigotry because he 
wouldn't celebrate homosexuality.  So that's not exactly 
asking to be left alone and just being tolerant.

<p>

This is a very aggressive agenda that is designed 
to harness the power of law to force affirmation of 
homosexuality on everybody else, because, as you asked, are 
gays doing okay in the workplace?  Yes, I would say so.  The 
surveys show they are among the top group in per capita 
income, disposable income, college degrees, advanced 
degrees, even frequent flyer miles.  I mean, they travel a 
lot.  The gay magazines are full of luxury items.  They're 
not hurting.  They're not hurting like blacks were after 
years of racism and Jim Crow laws.  They just don't meet the 
requirement for a put-upon minority group.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think one thing that we have to 
do, from the Family Research Council, we are always looking 
at what happens to children.  Looking at the DOMA and the 
gay civil rights bill, one of the things that we are all 
seeing a lot of is lesbian couples adopting -- this has 
become very vogue lately -- and a lot of controversy now 
that we are in the back-to-school time about human sexuality 
classes, and whether or not we say that homosexuality exists 
or whether we say that it is morally neutral and people are 
just as welcome to enter that as any other lifestyle.

<p>

How do you think a gay civil rights bill would 
affect lesbian or homosexual adoptions or the kinds of 
things that we teach in a sex education class?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it would be a tremendous boost 
to the attempts by homosexuals to adopt children.  We saw 
that in a Florida case right after Amendment 2 was shot down 
by the Supreme Court.  That was the Colorado amendment that 
said you can't make sexual orientation a specially protected 
class.  A lesbian lawyer misinterpreted the ruling but used 
it in a case, an adoption case, saying the Supreme Court 
says you can't discriminate in any way against homosexuals, 
even in parenting.  And, of course, the Court never said any 
such thing, but that is the kind of thing that happens when 
you enshrine the concept of sexual orientation within the 
law.

<p>

There is a perception that if it ain't illegal, 
it's okay, and if you raise the bar even higher and say not 
only isn't it illegal but we're going to give it special 
benefits and privileges we don't give just any behavior, 
we're going to make --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Because we're celebrating it.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: We're celebrating, we're protecting 
it.  Society has a stake in making sure people continue to 
engage in homosexual behavior.  That's what they're saying.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to keep up with 
you, Bob, on what happens as I know this comes back, and 
when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you some highlights 
from the Democratic National Convention and we'll see how 
the Democrats addressed issues affecting you and your 
family. Stay tuned.

[Scenes from the Chicago Democratic National 
Convention, then segments from Celebration of Life rally 
held August 26, 1996, follow:]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RALPH HALL: Let me just say to 
you, to set the stage for brevity for the other Members of 
Congress and the other people who will speak, I served in 
the Texas Senate for 10 years, I served as a judge for 12 
years, I have been 16 years in the House of Representatives.
I have heard testimony from fathers and mothers.  I have 
heard testimony from pastors.  I have heard testimony from 
men and women of medicine.  I have heard testimony for all 
those years, and after hearing all of that from the word go, 
with rancor toward none but prayers for all, I come down on 
the side of life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE COLLIN PETERSON:  . . . and I think 
one of the good things about the fact that you're here at 
this convention and your presence is here is that you're 
getting at what we've been trying to do in the Congress, and 
that is to try to end some of the partisanship, to try to 
have some common-sense solutions to things, and try to end 
all this bickering and fighting that goes on between the 
parties.

<p>

We have worked hard to do that.  I hope that your 
organizations and your groups will look at Members of 
Congress based on what their beliefs are, what their voting 
records are, and where they stand on the issues, and not 
necessarily what party they belong to.

<p>

There are 43 members of the House of 
Representatives that vote pro-life 100 percent of the time. 
You can count on us to be there all the time. That's 
almost a fourth of the Democratic Caucus. There are a lot 
of people that are pro-life in the Democratic Party.  I am 
one of those people.  I am proud to be pro-life. . .

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE BART STUPAK: The issue before us 
today is not about the politics of choice but the deeply 
held principles of life and living.  The issue before us 
today is not about allowing the continuation of ghastly and 
objectionable procedures but of rededicating ourselves to 
the belief that all children should be protected.  They 
should live, and they should be allowed to grow.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. RALPH REED: Our message to President Clinton,
Al Gore, and Chris Dodd is, we will not allow you to drive 
pro-lifers out of the Democratic Party.  This party is going 
to continue to have pro-life activists.

<p>

[Conclusion of DNC segments.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It was wonderful to see the pro-life 
Democrats speaking out at rallies such as the one held by 
the Christian Coalition and the National Right to Life 
Committee.

<p>

Here to discuss the Democratic National Convention 
and its impact on America's families, we are joined by 
Maureen Roselli, executive director of the Catholic 
Alliance, and Cathy Deeds, deputy director of government 
relations for FRC.  Welcome to you both.

<p>

You all were both in Chicago taking a pro-family, 
pro-life message to the Democratic convention.  Whom did you 
find there that was willing to hear that message?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, we were very fortunate. As
you said, Christian Coalition hosted a rally called 
Celebration of Life on Monday.  We had that at the Field 
Museum.  It was attended by over 450 people, which was 
wonderful.  Collin Peterson and Representatives Stenholm, 
Stupak, and Volkmer all spoke at that rally.  So it was 
wonderful to see the Representatives come out, talk about 
the pro-life movement, and be so supported by such a large 
number of pro-life Democrats.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Who do you think represents the pro-family 
and pro-life constituency within the Democratic 
Party?  Certainly a lot of people talk about Reagan 
Democrats in terms of a lot of blue-collar family people and 
Catholics nationwide.  Do you think that still represents 
the group that really resonates with that message?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, certainly as Catholics we 
embrace the pro-life movement because it's a doctrinal issue 
with our faith. You cannot be anti-life and be a Catholic. 
So certainly those Catholics who are in the Democratic 
Party should be going toward the pro-life movement.
Certainly Governor Casey has been a wonderful example of 
that in the Democratic Party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: He now heads the American Families Organization.

<p>

And, Cathy, I know you were there for Family 
Research Council.  What did you find as you were looking for 
people to talk with about a pro-family message?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Well, of course, as you know, Kristi, 
Family Research Council is a nonpartisan organization, but 
we feel like our issues and our message transcend political 
parties, so FRC wanted to have a presence at both the 
Republican and the Democratic conventions.

<p>

Although it was a little more limited in the sense 
that we had to talk about maybe fewer issues that some 
Democratic people would be concerned about, we brought some 
messages to the various delegates, like -- we can get into 
those later on -- partial-birth abortion and family tax 
relief, the Defense of Marriage Act, which many of them 
should and do support.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about that in a moment.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i>
continues our discussion of the Democratic National 
Convention. Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking about the 
Democratic National Convention and the impact of policy 
discussed there on America's families.  I am joined by some 
key players in the fight for life, Maureen Roselli, 
executive director for the Catholic Alliance, and Cathy 
Deeds, the Family Research Council's deputy director of 
government relations.  Welcome back.

<p>

There were some issues that sent both of you to 
Chicago.  Maureen, what were you hoping to talk about?  What 
issues had the Catholic Alliance said, look, these are our 
key issues?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, the key issue that we wanted 
to bring for the Democratic Party was, of course, the pro-life 
issue.  We went to participate in the Celebration of 
Life that was hosted by Christian Coalition and National 
Right to Life, as I mentioned before.  Unfortunately, we 
found not as much tolerance for that discussion as we found 
in perhaps the other convention.

<p>

We, of course, are a nonpartisan organization. As 
a matter of fact, half of our advisory board is Democrat, 
and our membership is well represented by both Democrats and 
Republicans and even independents who join our organization.

<p>

But we basically found that the platform of the 
Democratic Party is so extreme, and it is only embraced by 
perhaps 5 to 10 percent of the population, and that platform 
is that abortion should be granted on demand and paid for by 
tax dollars.

<p>

So, really, as I said, it is only embraced by 5 to 
10 percent of the people, and we believe that, generally, 
Democrats are much more mainstream on this issue, and 
certainly Catholic Democrats are far more pro-life.  In a 
recent poll, it was discovered that 10 to 15 percent of 
Catholics would not vote for the Democratic Party because of 
the partial-birth abortion issue, even though they were 
Democrat.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Partial-birth abortion is a 
tremendous rallying cry right now.  Cathy, there is going to 
be an event tomorrow, Thursday, surrounding that.  Could you 
tell us a little bit more about that?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Yes, our listeners might be interested 
to know that. A very unprecedented event, really, that we 
expect about 100 Catholic bishops, and all of the Catholic 
cardinals in the United States are going to be here in 
Washington, and they are going to the Capitol to really 
plead with President Clinton one final time, or actually to 
Congress to override the President's veto of (the) partial-birth 
abortion (ban).

<p>

Partial-birth abortion is a good example when 
we are talking about pro-life Democrats, because, as 
everyone probably knows by now, it was such a bipartisan-supported 
bill, and more than 72 Democrats voted to ban this 
procedure.  And yet this President that says he wants to 
make abortion safe, legal, and rare, he could have done that 
by signing this bill, and he vetoed it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And to describe this horrible thing, 
a child, generally a child that could live outside the womb,
is delivered feet first into the birth canal, stabbed in the 
base of the skull, living brain tissue suctioned out, and 
then the dead child delivered, a child that the developer of 
that procedure said could live, that the majority of these 
horrible procedures are done on viable babies.

<p>

This has been a tremendous rallying cry for 
Republicans and Democrats.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes, absolutely, and it has been a 
really unifying issue for Catholics as well.  As Cathy said, 
the bishops have, in an unprecedented move this summer, 
asked people to participate in a postcard campaign on 
partial-birth abortion.  Even the Holy Father spoke out 
against this heinous crime, which is really, as Helen 
Alvarey(?) said, four-fifths infanticide and one-fifth 
abortion.

<p>

Catholic Alliance mailed out over 572,000 letters 
to Americans, Catholic Americans, educating them about this 
horrible procedure, and we have received tremendous response 
calling for the override of the President's veto.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What was your experience when you 
talked to the people at the Democratic National Convention 
about partial-birth abortion, which has been certainly a 
rallying cry, and then the life issue in general?  Were they 
interested in talking to you all about that?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Well, as a matter of fact, it was 
quite difficult in some sense, and I was reading a poll 
during the convention that said more than 60 percent of the 
convention delegates were pro-abortion, and in fact 77 
percent of the delegates supported the President's veto of 
the partial-birth abortion bill, clearly out of step with 
mainstream America and even Democrats, because we know about 
a third of self-identified Democrats are pro-life.

<p>

So we kind of had a difficult time breaking in to 
that particular audience, but we still tried, and what 
Family Research Council generally did was kind of just pass 
out our information on the partial-birth abortion.  People 
seemed thankful.  We had a few conversations.  But I don't 
know how well it really resonated.  We got a lot of paper 
out there.  Hopefully, people will be contacting us.
Hopefully, it dispelled some of the myths that they are 
hearing certainly from the White House, unfortunately.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The myths on partial-birth abortions.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Did you find that people were 
generally uninformed about the realities?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, I think, like Family Research 
Council, Catholic Alliance, our contact at the Democratic 
convention was almost limited to those people who are 
already pro-life and pro-family.  We attended the Wednesday 
rally that was held outside of the actual convention.  There 
was a large rally; about 1,500 people attended.  Catholic 
Alliance was there and Family Research Council was there, as 
well, and they were passing out their fine information on 
the partial-birth abortion ban.

<p>

But I found that it was generally the people who 
were already pro-life who were taking that information, who 
were willing to talk to us about partial-birth abortion or 
any life issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Frustrating.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: But that was another reason to be 
there, as well, to be of support for these pro-life 
Democratic heroes who really are in the minority and are 
oftentimes kind of punished or pushed to the side; nobody 
wants to hear from them.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: And we found that that was so, even 
though the Democratic Party talked about their "conscience 
clause" that is now in their platform, that they are 
supposed to be tolerant of the -- quote, unquote -- 
intolerant pro-lifers.

<p>

So even though that may be part of their platform 
now, our experience was still that we generally were only 
received by those people who were already, again, pro-life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There were some interesting 
contrasts in the two platforms, and we are going to have to 
talk about that in a moment.  More about the Democratic 
National Convention when we return.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are discussing the 
Democrats' role in the fight for America's families, and to 
help in that discussion, I am joined once again by Maureen 
Roselli and Cathy Deeds.  Maureen, I have to apologize in 
saying your name wrong the entire time.

<p>

It was interesting, though, to contrast -- Family 
Research Council was at San Diego and at Chicago, both, and 
the brouhaha over the way in which the Republicans weren't 
equally pro-abortion and pro-life seemed absent from the 
Democratic convention.  Did you find that the Democrats had 
more unanimity on this point and that is why it wasn't worth 
reporting?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, actually, I think it was 
really a media decision; at least that is what we found.  
There are the same number of pro-abortion Republicans as 
there are pro-life Democrats, and yet the pro-abortion 
Republicans received much more media attention than the pro-life 
Democrats did at their convention.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And how many is that?  That's 40?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: It's 40, roughly.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: It's roughly about the same number, 
because we lack -- we oftentimes rely on those pro-life 
Democrats to make up the votes that the pro-abortion 
Republicans -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which is kind of an untold story in 
a lot of pro-life votes -- 

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Yes, I don't think people realize -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- is that there is a solid voting 
bloc of pro-life Democrats.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And so, even though the numbers were 
the same, the coverage seemed very different then.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: It did, and there seemed to be much 
more attention drawn to the pro-abortion Republicans because 
there seemed to be more perhaps media pressure to change the 
platform of the Republican Party than there was to change 
the platform of the Democratic Party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Republican Party had a very 
strong pro-life plank, you know, very much a commitment to 
the unborn. And then they said, although we recognize that 
there are people with different views, and we want to be 
kind and respectful to each other.

<p>

And the Democrats.  Describe to us -- you said 
earlier a very extreme platform, but a lot of media 
attention was made about their so-called tolerance language, 
as well.  Was that reflected?  At the Republican convention, 
we saw a lot of pro-abortion speakers.  And at the 
Democratic convention, what did you all find?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, we know that Tony Hall was 
able to speak at the Democratic convention, but of course, 
what he was able to say was very limited.  When Cynthia 
McKinney of Georgia, who is a pro-abortionist, called for 
tolerance of the pro-life people in her party, she was met 
by silence at the convention.

<p>

So I think that certainly at the Republican Party, 
the Republicans seemed to go a little more out of their way 
to represent the pro-abortion side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What was your experience, Cathy?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Just to add onto that, I think the 
Democrats were certainly more representative at their 
convention of their platform.  As we have been saying, their 
platform -- very extreme; it reaffirms the <i>Roe v. Wade</i>
decision, which is abortion on demand; no sort of call for 
any sort of restrictions; no support at all for the partial-
birth abortion (ban), which we said many, many Democrats 
supported, and then the speakers were consistently pro-
abortion.  Kate Michaelman(?) -- it was not shown on prime 
time, but the head of a national abortion rights group did 
talk about abortion and her own abortion.  I think that is 
very, very sad.

<p>

On the other hand, we saw in San Diego a very, 
very strong pro-life platform, very, very compassionate, 
wonderful language; and yet where were the pro-life speakers 
on the platform in San Diego?  We had wonderful heroes.  
Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde, who did chair the platform 
committee -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Republican platform.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Right, the Republican platform -- he 
did speak at the convention, and he maybe had one line about 
the sanctity of human life.  But he was not able, it was my 
understanding, to give a specifically pro-life speech.  We 
certainly didn't have the president of National Right to 
Life giving any sort of speech, and in fact, it seems like 
the Republicans went out of their way to be tolerant of 
people like Colin Powell and Susan Molinari and other fairly 
prominent pro-abortion Republicans who reminded us of that 
of the platform.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: I think we have to say Governor 
Casey also experienced a repeat of four years ago.  He even 
went to Chicago to wait for the call so that he could go -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Governor Casey, the former governor of Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: That is right, the former governor 
of Pennsylvania, a pro-life Democrat and really quite a 
sophisticated Democrat, was denied the right again this year 
to speak at his convention, the party that he has supported 
all of his life.  So again, he experienced that.  He went 
even to Chicago this time and waited for a phone call; still 
was not allowed to talk.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It wasn't quite the tolerant thing 
that we heard about in the news, it would seem.

<p>

I would like to thank both of you for sharing your 
stories and thank you even more so for going there to 
encourage the pro-life Democrats that we all know and work 
with.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you more

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are discussing some solutions
to the current predicament of our education system.  It's
back-to-school time for children and parents across the
country, who face decisions ranging from school choice, or
lack of choice, to how to deal with controversial student
curriculum.

<p>

We will be talking to Congressman Lindsey Graham, 
who has proposed new steps toward education reform, and we 
will also be talking to a man who founded an organization 
which provides less privileged children and their parents 
with school choice.  You won't want to miss hearing what is 
happening in education on tonight's show.

<p>

But first, we will be taking you to an historical 
event that took place just last week.  Catholic cardinals 
and bishops, along with other religious leaders from across 
the country, gathered to lead prayer on the steps of our 
Nation's Capitol.  Their prayers were pleas for the lives of 
unborn children and appeals to our Congress as they vote to 
override the President's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act, a vote that could come even tomorrow.

<p>

This is very timely because, just hours ago, the 
Clinton Administration successfully pushed the FDA approval 
of the abortion-causing drug, RU 486.  The Family Research 
Council is already targeting this historical decision, and 
we will keep you informed of that decision's consequences.

<p>

You may have caught a glimpse of the powerful day 
of prayer in your newspaper or on your local newscast, but 
we have much more to show you as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you 
Behind the Headlines.

[Segments from Prayer for Life at the Capitol, held September 
12, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MS. HELEN ALVARES: We come here today to pray at 
the place where life-and-death decisions are being made by 
lawmakers, decisions which affect the very most defenseless 
among us, the unborn.  We will pray for members of Congress, 
for mothers and fathers tempted to abortion, for all 
children -- born, unborn, nearly born -- for many others who 
are threatened in some way.

<p>

As you know, within a few weeks, the House and the 
Senate will vote on the override of the Presidential veto of 
the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.  We therefore pray for 
members of Congress to act on their obligation to defend 
life and to reject the cruel destruction of infants only 
seconds away from taking their first breath.

<p>

<p>

CARDINAL JAMES HICKEY: Brothers and sisters, you 
and I stand at the edge of a new century and a new 
millennium.  Either it will be an era of life or an era of 
death.  Either we will protect life or destroy it.  With all 
our hearts, with all that is within us, we pray this day and 
every day that our nation will choose to protect life, the 
life of the unborn child in the womb, the life of the child 
as he or she is being born, also the life of the frail 
elderly and the terminally ill.

<p>

We ask Almighty God to give us the wisdom to 
reject the culture of death and, instead, to embrace the 
culture of life.  We come here not as political leaders nor 
as lobbyists, but we come as men and women of different 
faiths who are united in prayer and united in a common 
cause, and our cause is life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL WILLIAM KEELER: Here today are those 
from other churches who support the culture of life.  
Together, we are bound by our support of life and by our 
opposition to partial-birth abortion.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

PASTOR GEORGE ANDERSON: Indeed, men and women of 
faith -- Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim 
people -- are one, are allies, as we stand in defense of 
children and the family.  We stand united against this 
hideous and inhuman abortion procedure.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL BERNARD LAW: We gather on the steps of 
our Nation's Capitol to pray.  Mindful of our obligation to 
the littlest, the weakest, and the most forgotten, we pray. 
Hopeful that those who work in this place will know the 
right and do it, we pray.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL JOSEPH BERNADIN: If you obey the 
commandments of the Lord your God, which I command on you 
this day, by loving the Lord your God, by walking in His 
ways, and by keeping His commandments and His statutes and 
His ordinances, then you shall live.  Therefore, choose 
life, that you and your descendants may live, loving the 
Lord your God, obeying His voice, and cleaving to Him, for 
that means life to you and length of days.

<p>

REV. JEFFREY BROWN: If a man has 100 sheep and 
one of them goes astray, will he not leave the 99 in the 
hills and go in search of the stray?  And if he finds it, 
amen, I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the 
99 that did not stray.  In just the same way, it is not the 
will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones 
be lost.

<p>

[Conclusion of segments from Prayer for Life at the Capitol.]

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The sinking test scores of U.S. 
students over the course of the past few years have forced 
parents, teachers, and politicians alike to face a crisis 
which permeates our schools today.  Despite many attempts to 
fix our education system, the harsh reality remains:  poor 
student performance has many underlying causes and no easy 
solutions.

<p>

In 1994 Congress made its own attempt to improve 
student performance by passing legislation called Goals 
2000.  The bill set in place national curriculum standards. 
Controversial from its outset, Goals 2000 added to the 
power of the Department of Education by allowing the Federal 
Government to interfere with school curriculum.  Previously, 
such involvement was prohibited, and without this important 
restriction, parents have almost no voice against decisions 
made by Washington bureaucrats.

<p>

Like most things that come out of Washington, 
Goals 2000 also has a power game attached.  In exchange for 
federal money, school districts must conform to national 
attitudinal and behavioral standards.  These take away the 
emphasis on learning and place it on socialization.  In 
essence, Goals 2000 standards allow conflict resolution 
training and comprehensive sex education to overshadow 
instruction in basic skills like grammar and math, even at 
the elementary school level.

<p>

Goals 2000 proponents claim the program gives 
local parents and teachers important decision-making 
authority.  In fact, the only choice Goals 2000 leaves at 
the local level is whether or not to participate.  Several 
states, including Virginia, New Hampshire, Montana, and 
Alabama, rejected the Goals 2000 money, giving up access to 
the federal tax dollars in exchange for local control of 
schools.  But, whether or not a state participates in Goals 
2000, every taxpayer foots the bill.  And the battle over 
who defines good education rages on.

<p>

The controversy over Goals 2000 brought a recent 
flurry of activity on Capitol Hill.  To clear up confusion 
about some recent governmental decisions regarding Goals 
2000, I am joined by Congressman Lindsey Graham, who just 
this morning introduced a bill that would stop federal 
funding of Goals 2000.

<p>

We are also joined by Jennifer A. Marshall, FRC's 
education policy analyst.  Jennifer keeps families, 
educators, and legislators informed on all the hot education 
issues.

<p>

Welcome, both of you, to the show.

<p>

You know, Congressman, when I came to Washington 
in the 1980s -- I have actually been here now almost 10 
years -- we were going to get rid of the Department of 
Education.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: We're still talking about it, aren't we?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we're still talking about that.
And then Goals 2000 came up, and so we were just going to 
fix the Department of Education.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But why do you want to get rid of 
Goals 2000 and defund it?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, let's talk about 
what we are trying to do with this legislation.  Goals 2000 
was an idea that came out of the Bush Administration about 
having national standards to compete in a global economy.  
That sounds really good on paper, that we are going to have 
school districts pushing at the 21st century so our kids can 
compete with the Japanese and the Germans.

<p>

The problem is, when you start taking national 
standards and implementing them, the agenda of the 
bureaucracy gets put in place.  And, to be honest with you, 
the NEA owns the Democratic education agenda; they own the 
Department of Education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The National Education Association.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The teachers' unions.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: The teachers' unions, okay.

<p>

They are a very liberal group.  To deny that is to 
deny the obvious.  It is not a crime to be liberal; I just 
disagree.  If the conservatives take over the White House, 
which we will one day, I really don't believe it is good for 
America to have a conservative agenda coming out of the 
federal Department of Education.  I think these decisions 
need to be made at home.

<p>

So what we are doing is taking the $350 million 
that is allocated for Goals 2000 that would be run through 
the Department of Education and come home in dribbles; we 
are just going to bypass the Department of Education and the 
Federal Government and write the check to the states, who 
will in turn give it to the local school districts, and we 
are going to get the money home as quickly as possible.

<p>

There is a dynamic that has existed for a long 
time.  Six percent of the education funding in America comes 
from Washington.  Fifty percent of the mandates come out of 
Washington, D.C.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So for six pennies on the dollar, 
they are calling all the shots.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, in politics, the 
power is really the power of the purse.  If I can control 
your agenda by telling you what to do through legislation 
and mandates, I own you politically.  If I can tell a county 
council and a city council what they must do to comply with 
federal law, then I have taken a lot of their resources and 
directed how they spend it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: I don't give them the 
money, but I tell them what to do.  The same way in 
education.  If I can control the mandate part of education, 
how you teach, then I own your curriculum, I own you 
politically.  And I don't want to own anybody.  What I want 
to do is free up the parents, the teachers, and the local 
school officials and give them a shot at getting this money 
quickly and let them build a bridge to the 21st century that 
will be built on solid ground.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jennifer, are there any horror 
stories to come out of what we have seen of Goals 2000 so 
far, or are we just seeing people being asked to be sure 
that fifth graders can do algebra?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, it is certainly not the 
latter, and in fact, with the push for more and more social 
services to be offered in schools, we are seeing tragic 
cases like the one in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, 
where 60 young girls, adolescent girls, were told to strip 
down to their underwear, wait -- scared little girls; some 
were prevented from calling their mothers -- and they then 
proceeded to have genital exams.  That is just horrific, and 
there was no parental warning there.

<p>

This is the kind of thing that happens when 
schools think they play a bigger role in kids' health than 
the parents do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, I am sure you have 
heard this argument as many times as I have:  Well, the 
reason why we need federal standards is not for the good 
parents that would take their children to the doctor but all 
of those terrible parents out there that wouldn't.  Will 
Goals 2000 get at the liberal straw man of the terrible 
parents abandoning their kids?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: I think what we need to do 
in Washington is get behind labels.  Drug-free schools.  
That's a label that sounds great.  Goals 2000.  It sounds 
like a good program to move the country forward.  Let's look 
at education results over the last 30 years and see if it is 
rational to continue to turn to the Federal Government.

<p>

Since 1965, test scores in this country have 
plummeted.  They have gone literally downhill at a dramatic 
rate, all-time lows.  Dropout rates are up.  Schools are not 
safe to go to anymore.  And what we have realized is that 
every time we increase the power of the Federal Government, 
the best we do is become stagnant.

<p>

So the evidence is in pretty clearly that for the 
last 16 or 17 years, turning to an exclusive federal remedy 
is not working.  We are not improving test scores.  We are 
not enhancing learning.  We are not getting parents more 
involved; they are less involved.

<p>

So let's do something different.  Let's take the 
money that would be spent through federal bureaucracies with 
a federal stamp of approval and free up the resources at the 
local level, give people more money, and let parents and 
teachers and local school officials sit down and design a 
curriculum that they feel good about, that the good parents 
feel good about, and that really addresses the bad parents 
in a local community, because all bad parents are not alike.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, it is interesting.
Education Secretary Riley had this huge news conference 
about six months ago about how we know that if parents are 
involved, children do better, and in fact, the data was 
interesting that even if you had shown up at a PTA meeting, 
your children then were more likely to do well; that parents 
who were involved had children who did better.

<p>

And then we move all the curriculum decisions to 
Washington, D.C.  I mean, what have you seen, Jennifer, in 
terms of involved parents equalling better educated 
children?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, there are mounds and mounds 
of research that say parents are the single most important 
factor in their kids' educational achievement.  It has been 
proven by home schoolers, it has been proven by Christian 
schoolers, public schoolers.  Any environment, parents are 
the key factor.

<p>

So that just calls more and more for the decisions 
being made locally, by parents who care.  You know, the 
Washington bureaucrats -- Secretary Riley, Bill Clinton -- 
don't care more about our kids than we do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, I think one thing that 
is interesting in some of the debate is the discussion of 
the fact that Bill Clinton and Al Gore have their children 
in private, faith-based schools, as do the majority of the 
Washington elite.  And then you have Goals 2000, on the 
other hand, dictating what your children will learn, even 
though I wouldn't put my child in that school.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right. Well, let's agree 
on something.  Secretary Riley is from South Carolina; I am 
from South Carolina.  I know he cares about the kids in this 
country.  I am sure President Clinton does.  He cares about 
his daughter, and as a parent, he made a good decision.  He 
tried to put his daughter in the best educational 
environment he could find for her so she would be safe and 
she would learn.  He did what every parent in America should 
do.

<p>

What I am saying is, let's give the parents of 
America some of the resources that would filter through our 
bureaucracy; give it to them directly in conjunction with 
our local school officials and see if they can create an 
environment where they can send their kid to a public school 
or maybe a private school that they feel better about.

<p>

This idea that you can only have compassion if you 
spend money in Washington and you can only trust quality 
coming out of Washington is a dismal failure.  Just look at 
the evidence.  I don't have any children, but I am a 
taxpayer, and one day I hope to have a family.  But I can 
tell you from a taxpayer's point of view, we are spending 
$120 billion cycling through federal bureaucracies, not just 
the Department of Education -- it is only $32 billion -- so 
there is $120 billion being spent through Washington, D.C., 
bureaucracies, and the children and the teachers are getting 
about 26 cents of the dollar.  If you designed a business 
this way, you would go broke in a week.

<p>

So we are trying to get a new formula, what she 
just said.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist or a 
Ph.D. to figure out that the best way to have a quality 
school is have moms and dads showing up at PTA meetings, 
having kids go, with teachers who have the power to teach 
and are not micromanaged from afar.  This is simple, basic 
stuff that served our country well for 180 years.  Only 
since the Great Society have we seen a bottoming out of 
education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's interesting, isn't it?  I mean, 
I saw a chart just the other day -- I think it was from the 
Heritage Foundation, another conservative organization -- 
that was saying that they looked at the beginning of the 
Department of Education and tracked test scores with its 
inception and growth, and it was one of those things; it was 
almost an anti-chart, you know, a mirror image of, as the 
federal role has increased, the educational system has done 
much poorer.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, the dropout rates 
are at an all-time high.  The test scores, SAT quantitative 
test scores, have gone down a tremendous amount.  In 1965 
they were about 950.  They have really dropped, and they are 
just stagnant now.

<p>

All the money we spend in Washington and all the 
bureaucracies we have created in Washington have, at best, 
kept us stagnant.  I am looking for a different way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, has anything good come 
out of Goals 2000?  I mean, you were there to defund it 
today. Is there any good news with that bad news pill?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, everybody says it is 
a voluntary program and it has done a lot but we can't get 
-- well, if it is voluntary, why not just -- you know, 
what's the big deal about getting rid of it?  If there is no 
federal control, why is everybody so dead-set in the NEA and 
other liberals of hanging onto it?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what do they say to that?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, they just said,
Well, there is no micromanaging.  Well, why not just get rid 
of it?  There is.  Obviously, there is.  That is why they 
are fighting for it.

<p>

Their agenda can never survive at the local level.
You would never have homosexual awareness week in most 
school districts.  The only way you are going to have it is 
to have a power base in Washington, D.C., that mandates 
curriculum that goes the liberal way.  You cannot win these 
wars at the local level.  So if they can consolidate money 
and power in Washington, then they can control the 
curriculum, but only then.

<p>

So what we are trying to do is destroy a breeding 
ground that is going to lead to more federal intervention, 
is going to lead to more NEA-type doctrine, because this is 
surely the first step along a long road of more federal 
involvement.

<p>

Let's nip it in the bud now.  Let's take the money 
back home, send it directly with no carrying charges, and 
see in a few years from now if we have a better school 
system.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We know, Congressman, that you have 
to get back to the Hill.  It's a busy week.  Before you go, 
we have been talking a lot about partial-birth abortion, as 
I am sure you are aware of.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We appreciate your taking this quick 
moment out.  Any word as people are looking -- they are 
saying it might come up tomorrow, might come up next week.
How does that look, Congressman?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, it's a fluid 
situation right now.  Please get on the phones, write 
letters.  Don't send them to my office.  We are going to 
vote to override the veto.  Get involved.  I think this is 
one that we have a shot at winning.  The Catholic Church has 
gotten behind the issue.  There is a real faith-based 
coalition growing out there.

<p>

Pro-choice people voted against this procedure 
because it is so ghastly.  If you look at the facts, if you 
look at exactly what we do to children under this procedure, 
it is a blight on America.  And if we cannot come together 
and stop this, I am really very disappointed in my 
government right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Congressman, for being 
with us. Jennifer, we will see more of you in a moment.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will bring you more 
about America's education standards, and we will introduce 
you to a man who is helping give parents some new choices.  
Please stay with us.

[Segments from Washington Scholarship Fund FUNDay, 
held September 15, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MR. RANDALL BYRNES (Co-Chairman): We feel at the 
Washington Scholarship Fund, when we start these children in 
the programs, their age is kindergarten, they start in 
kindergarten and they go all the way up through the eighth 
grade, and at ages 5 through 14, those are the most 
formative ages in their lives, and we feel as though it is 
important that they get the kind of quality education and 
the nurturing that, unfortunately, they are not getting in 
the public school system.

<p>

So by virtue of having them go to whatever private 
school they deem desirable -- most of them are schools in 
their neighborhoods, Catholic schools and other independent 
schools -- then they can get a good start in life and 
receive the kind of attention and care and discipline and 
value system, as well as the education, that will put them 
in good stead for life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. ROBERT THOMPSON (Co-Chairman): When we 
started it two and a half or three years ago, the Washington 
Times ran a full-page ad gratis for a couple of days.  Since 
that time, it has been all word of mouth.  We have 225 
children on scholarship, but we have 600 on the waiting 
list.

<p>

What Randy and I consider our main role is to 
figure out a way to raise enough money to take those 600 
kids off the waiting list.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. GEORGE JOCHUM (Board Member): Well, we first 
heard about the Washington Scholarship Fund through a 
friend, and we really liked the concept that you help young 
people get a better education.  What is extraordinary about 
this is it is just not a gift.  The parents, who are less 
affluent than most, have to pay half.  So you feel like you 
are truly making a contribution, not only for the children 
but also for the parents.  The parents are making great 
sacrifices.

<p>

MS. CRIS JOCHUM: And we certainly understand how 
important education is and also understand how important it 
is that the parents are committed to education.  And that is 
what is so great about this program, because the parents are 
as involved as the children are or they couldn't be in the 
program.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. LYNDON BILAL (Recipient Parent): I got the 
<i>Washington Times</i> newspaper on a Saturday evening and went in 
to work, and my concern was how am I going to be able to 
send these children to a school that I would like to send 
them to, which for me it's an Islamic school.  And so I was 
blessed to see that article in the <i>Washington Times</i>, and 
then I immediately filled it out and faxed it in that night.
I have three children that are being sponsored by 
Washington Scholarship Fund, and I have four children in the 
school, but only three of them are being sponsored, but that 
is a tremendous help.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: I found out about the program 
through my aunt at one of the libraries up in Georgetown, 
and I called and applied for the scholarship fund and 
waited, and I got the scholarship.  I have one child.  She 
is 5.  I want her to have a good foundation to start, and I 
think it's the best considering the public school situation 
that is around us.  And she is doing an excellent job, and I 
really, really want to thank the scholarship fund.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: Well, I wanted them to get a 
better education through Saint Augustine.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: It's a little more disciplined 
attitudes, all of that,  It's different, the learning -- I 
don't know, it's more or less like they want to learn.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. THOMPSON: This is my way of trying to give 
something back to the community, and I believe it is the 
best return on a charitable dollar because we are giving 
these young kids an opportunity to get a very good education 
as well as the values that go with that.

<p>

[Conclusion of segments.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you just witnessed, the 
Washington Scholarship Fund is impacting the lives of 
parents and their children's education.

<p>

With us today is Doug Dewey, the founding 
president of the National Scholarship Center and the 
executive director of the Washington Scholarship Fund.  Also 
with us again is Jennifer A. Marshall, FRC's education 
policy analyst, who brings us education innovators such as 
Doug.

<p>

Welcome very much.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, your program is very unique, 
and we are going to hear a lot about it in these next couple 
of minutes.  But one of the key functions of it is to get 
parents involved in their children's education.  Why is 
that?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, as Jennifer said, the evidence 
is just overwhelming that that is the number one indicator 
of success for schooling, and that is no different for low-
income, underprivileged children in inner cities.

<p>

What our program does, it is kind of a tough-love 
scholarship program.  We provide half of the tuition for any 
non-government school that a family wishes to send their 
children to, up to a maximum of $1,500 a year, and the 
parents are responsible to pay the rest.

<p>

You have to understand that the average annual 
income of the parents in our program is $14,000.  So they 
are making an incommensurate sacrifice on behalf of their 
children.  We send the checks to the schools from September 
to June, and they are written out to the mother and to the 
school.  They have to be endorsed by the mother.  That keeps 
them involved, knowing that they have to pay -- some of them 
pay on a weekly basis and, we have even heard, in rolls of 
quarters.  Some of them pay on a monthly basis.  But all of 
them are owners of their education, and they take great 
pride in that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you have found it's not an 
income-level outcome, but it is an involvement outcome that 
has made a difference?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, definitely. As I say, our average 
income is very low.  But I think if I had to point to a 
single difference of why these people are doing so well -- 
in the private schools in the inner city, regardless of 
whether they are Catholic or Christian or non-denominational 
or non-sectarian, they all have about a 95 to 99 percent 
graduate rate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. Compare that for us, 
Jennifer, quickly, with schools at large.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I think we are talking about 70s.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So 70 percent national average.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: And about 40 percent in the District 
of Columbia.  And not only that, the children go on to 
college at a rate of about 85 percent, and they complete 
college.

<p>

So they are the children from the same 
neighborhoods, from the same demographic facts, that you 
would look at them and all of those expectations that they 
would not succeed, and yet they do.

<p>

So again, if I had to point to one thing, apart 
from all of the faith and the discipline and the things that 
people talk about that exist in private schools, I think it 
is that ownership of education which comes with paying your 
own tuition.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, then, in a way, you must be 
excited about a recent headline out of New York City where 
the Catholic Church has offered to take the 1,000 children 
at the very lowest end of ability in the schools and put 
them into private school.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, indeed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you see that as an answer?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: I do. No one knows yet how the 
program there will be structured, but I think it is a 
courageous offer from Cardinal O'Connor to take the bottom, 
I guess they said 5 percent, but we won't know how they are 
going to structure it.  I would hope, and I would advise if 
I were asked, that they include a parental match component 
in their program.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To get people involved.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That is right, so that all those 
children, their families are paying something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to be coming back in a 
moment, Doug, but if you could tell us, are you concerned -- 
and we can talk more -- that as vouchers develop -- and 
there are experiments in Cleveland and around the country -- 
that that is going to mean federal control of the private 
schools that are doing well by the kids you are talking 
about?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, a lot of people have that 
concern; there's just no doubt about it.  Attempts to pass 
vouchers in different jurisdictions around the country have 
been going on for about 15 years now, and with each 
successive version, in order to try to secure passage and 
enactment, we find more and more compromises.  I think this 
is putting more and more conservatives and Christians and 
home schoolers and others on the alert.

<p>

One of the advantages of privately funded vouchers --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which you have.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That's right -- is that they sidestep 
this whole controversy because they don't use government 
funds.  And so, of course, they carry none of the risks.  If 
I wanted to regulate the schools in my program, I have no 
power to do so.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about that in just a moment. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we 
will continue our discussion on education and how parents 
can make the most of available resources.  Please stay with 
us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are discussing some 
alternative solutions to the decline of education standards.
I am joined by Doug Dewey, president of the National 
Scholarship Center and executive director of the Washington 
Scholarship Fund.  Also joining us is Jennifer A. Marshall, 
FRC's education policy analyst.  Welcome back, both of you.

<p>

You know, Jennifer, there is a lot of frustration 
on the part of parents with the role of government, and you 
see a program like this, in a way, doing an end run.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Oh, yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think about that?  We're 
cutting out the middle man.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, it's wonderful.  You know, we 
get so many questions about what would happen if we 
decreased the federal role in education.  What if we got rid 
of it?  It would be disaster for education.  Well, no, it 
wouldn't.  Things like this would happen.  Things like this 
are happening now.  And they are recapturing education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: These are success stories, Doug, and 
we are excited to present your story.  How did you guys get 
started?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: I was working, I must confess, for 
Lamar Alexander, helping craft America 2000 -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now Goals 2000.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: -- which became Goals 2000, renamed 
and made worse, to be sure, when I came across a program 
started by a chairman of the Golden Rule Insurance Company, 
Patrick Rooney(?), who is in Indianapolis, Indiana.  He had 
made an attempt to get some vouchers for children in 
Indianapolis from the legislature there, failed, and 
somewhat on the rebound of that, decided, well, he will put 
his own money where his mouth is, and he earmarked 
$1.2 million in 1991, announced it in the radio and the 
newspapers in August, and had 1,000 kids in school that 
September.  Now he is entering his sixth year.

<p>

So I wrote about that while I was at the 
department, got very excited.  You may recall the results of 
the 1992 election.  Well, I was a Bush White House 
appointee, so I needed something to do, even if it wasn't 
gainful employment, and we needed this kind of opportunity 
for children in Washington, D.C.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And how long has this program been operating?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: We are going into our third year now. 
We started with 30 children in 1993 and went up to 100 and 
150.  Now we are at 225 children, and we have 600 children 
on the waiting list.

<p>

Our average grant, what we get for the money, is 
$1,000 for each child, and that sends a child to a private 
school for an entire year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know what is amazing about that 
is the District of Columbia's cost per child in education is 
the highest in the nation.  I think it is what, $9,000,
Jennifer?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The highest amount of money, $9,000, 
with violence and the drug problem and the dropout rate.  
And for $1,000, one-ninth of the cost, you are going to put 
a child in a safe and effective educational environment.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doesn't money make the difference?  
If we spent more on education, aren't we going to get more?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, I know of one economist in 
California who has done a study which actually shows an 
inverse relationship between spending and achievement.  But 
I do know that for a little bit of money, you can get a lot 
of impact from these programs.

<p.

After Pat Rooney started his program in 1991, we 
had copycat programs in Milwaukee, San Antonio, Atlanta, and 
now they have spread.  By 1996, right now, we have 28 
programs in 27 jurisdictions around the country, with about 
10,000 low-income children all going to private schools of 
their choosing -- Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Catholic, every 
variety -- and I think that is very exciting and very 
promising.

<p>

And for those who don't like publicly funded 
vouchers, either for conservative reasons or for liberal 
reasons, as it were, this is a great alternative.  This is 
something everybody can be involved in.  On our board we 
have Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and William Bennett as 
our two honorary co-chairmen.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Two different political ends.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Absolutely. And we can all agree, 
low-income parents who want this opportunity for their 
children, it is an appropriate thing for the private sector 
to step in and give them a shot at that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jennifer, what has been the impact 
as programs like this have sprung up nationwide?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, they are the perfect example 
of what can be done and what is done by parents, by 
concerned neighborhood members, who want kids to have good 
education.

<p>

I think this is such a good example, and it is 
great to bring up in our legislative battles here, because 
there is such a mind-set in this beltway that problems can 
only be solved here, and if we don't do it here, those poor 
kids will just not get an education.  It is simply not true. 
There are parents, there are community members who care 
dearly about this and will provide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, the District of Columbia 
is a great case study.  Even recently in the political 
realm, I have heard some criticism from one political camp 
to another, you know, if liberalism was so great, why wasn't 
the District doing better?  And it's very sad the way the 
District is often the bad example, and it is unfortunate.

<p>

How are the children doing, though, in your 
program?  How are they faring individually?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, they are doing remarkably well. 
We have about an 85 percent retaining rate, or I guess a 15 
percent attrition rate.  Five percent of that are just 
people that have moved to Prince George's County or another 
county outside of Washington.  We only serve Washington 
children for now.  So I think they are doing extraordinarily 
well.

<p>

We had one child at Saint Augustine School who was 
new to private school, and they were able to get a grant 
from us, and she became valedictorian and is going to attend 
one of the premier Catholic prep schools next year, or this 
year she is just starting.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Wow! That's great.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: We have another boy that we know who 
just got academic prize of the year, and he was also 
formerly in a government school.  So we know that we've got 
not only some superstars but just the fact that they are 
staying in there, that they are having to make an enormous 
discipline adjustment from really very little requirement of 
being disciplined in the government schools to having to sit 
still, not speak out, never fight.  There is a pretty 
dramatic difference between these schools.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How are the children in the 
neighborhood and the families in the neighborhood responding 
as some of these children leave, going to different schools, 
and certainly having a different academic experience?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, that is an outstanding question, 
because I think -- and, again, I don't have a RAND study 
behind me on this so I can only say anecdotally -- I know 
that this program comes home with the child and has an 
effect in the neighborhood.  Mothers will call me and say 
how proud they are that their boy comes home in a uniform.
They tell their friends that they are paying for their 
children's education now; their boy is in private school, or 
their girl.  And then I get neighbors calling me saying, "I 
spoke to my neighbor who is doing this.  I want this for my 
child, too."

<p>

So this is real self-esteem, not the bogus 
injected kind that we sometimes hear about.  And so I think 
it has a great spillover effect to get people charged.

<p>

The other thing it is doing occasionally is it is 
bringing families that are broken apart back together.  
Grandmothers help out, sisters, and estranged fathers come 
back to help pay that tuition.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about private responses to public education.  More about 
your family's options when it comes to education and a 
special report from the Family Research Council.  Please 
stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are talking to some 
movers and shakers in the world of education.  With us are 
Doug Dewey and Jennifer A. Marshall.

<p>

Jennifer, you wrote about Doug's outstanding 
scholarship program in a really special report, the <i>Moms and
Dads' School Survival Guide</i>. We at the Family Research 
Council have been concerned about education for quite a 
while.  People may remember that Gary Bauer was Under 
Secretary of Education with Bill Bennett, one of your board 
members.

<p>

Jennifer, why did you write this publication?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, we hear maybe more than any 
other issue from parents and families about education, and 
we hope that this booklet will be just about everything you 
need to know about schooling and education and the concerns 
you should have.

<p>

One of the things you should know is that you have 
some options, and so we have included the listing of the 
private scholarship programs across the country.  You will 
find it in there, so if anybody is interested across the 
country, they can look to that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If you would like to hear more about 
Doug's program or programs available in your area, you are 
going to want to get one of these.  And, Jennifer, thanks 
for putting it together.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Sure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of problems are people 
faced with in the education system that this might be of 
assistance to them?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I would say the biggest problem -- 
just an overarching summary of it -- is that schools are 
moving more and more into the realms that families have 
filled for years and that are rightfully the role of 
families.  So we have a section in there on parental rights. 
We also have a discussion of current education trends, like 
outcome-based education and Goals 2000, easily 
understandable articles so that parents can be conversant in 
these issues, fight them in their schools.

<p>

We also have a section on education jargon that 
defines these terms that are just batted back and forth 
between education bureaucrats.

<p>

We have another section that describes students' 
religious freedoms in the public schools.  That is an 
important and very misunderstood area.  Many students could 
be exercising much more religious expression and religious 
freedom than they already are.

<p>

So we want students and families to know that and 
then to know about the options that they have if the public 
schools just aren't working for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Doug, as you are working 
with people often in the inner city, one of the things that 
we hear anecdotally, and I wonder if you agree, is that 
people are just intimidated to talk to school educators, 
sort of the tyranny of complexity.  How do I talk, what do I 
say? Will anybody even listen to me?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Yes. I would even go further and 
compare it to a kind of almost religious-type loyalty that a 
lot of parents that I deal with feel they should have for 
their public schools, their government schools, that they 
are not pleased with, clearly.  They are not happy.  They 
don't like their child failing and getting beaten up, and 
sometimes they want to tell me, "Well, the school's okay and 
all" -- they don't want to really confess how bad they 
really think the school is -- "but I just want to have more 
challenge or more foreign languages."  And, clearly, that is 
not at the forefront of their concern as I talk to them 
more.  So I do detect this from the parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We get a lot of calls, Jennifer, at 
Family Research Council.  What are sort of the top two, 
three, four calls that you get about education that we have 
really tried hard to work with here?

<p>

MR. MARSHALL: A lot of people are concerned about 
the content of their kids' curriculum, and this goes in all 
different directions, but sometimes it is just morbid, 
violent, horrible, dark stories that they are reading in 
literature; or in math they are simply not learning their 
times tables; or in reading they are in third grade and they 
don't know how to read yet because they are simply bypassing 
the simple method of phonics.

<p>

So many problems like that, then also problems 
where the school is simply not recognizing parents' rightful 
role in their children's lives and shutting them out of the 
educational process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When people have come to you, Doug, 
saying, "I want to get my children out of public school, 
government-run schools, to private schools," what are the 
reasons they give you?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, they give the whole gamut, from 
academics to discipline to wanting values taught to their 
children.  Most of the schools that we have are Catholic 
participating in our program because those are the most 
plentiful in the cities, but only a small minority of the 
families that are going to those Catholic schools are 
Catholic themselves.  So they want something that is usually 
Christian, but they want values, they want character.  They 
think that is important.

<p>

And they also want a greater responsiveness from 
the school, which they do not tend to get, I think, and that 
is probably the most common thing.  They say that I just 
can't make a difference.  There is nothing I can do.  I try. 
That's a word I hear all the time, that expression.  I 
tried but nothing happened, so I now feel I have to have 
this other option.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, as a person that helped work on 
Goals 2000 -- and we are not going to hold that against you 
too much --

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That was supposed to bring values 
into the classroom.  We are going to have the goal of 
values.  Why hasn't that worked?  Jennifer?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Maybe Jennifer should answer that.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I say simply that they are building 
bricks without straw.  There is not a solid basis, a 
consensus, about what these values even are.  Those are the 
solid virtues that should be taught in the home and clearly 
agreed upon among family members.

<p>

The public school, in trying to be accommodating 
to all different views, simply cannot even come up with the 
values that they want to teach, so they are not going to be 
successful in teaching them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, we have about a minute left, 
and I wanted to give you the last word.  As you look at the 
lives of the children in your program, why do you think this 
kind of endeavor is the way to go?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, I think just hearing what 
Jennifer was saying about having the values being taught at 
home, and when people do send their child to a school, they 
want to have that school agreeing with their most basic 
values.  Whether they be Catholics or Muslims or whatever it 
is, they don't want to be in a kind of tug-of-war for the 
minds and hearts of their children.

<p>

What this program allows is for those parents who 
want something for their children, who have at least one 
person in their life that is crazy about them and is willing 
to sacrifice for them, this gives them a chance.  It's a ray 
of hope for the whole nation when we see 10,000 very low-
income children in very disadvantaged circumstances who are 
taking charge of their education in its entirety -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And going forward.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That's right, and succeeding.  And I 
think that is a bright hope and a good sign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks so much for being with us, 
both of you.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you 
more information regarding issues affecting you and your 
family.  Hope you'll write us, and stay with us.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
The 104th Congress should close this week, so tonight
<i>Straight Talk</i> is discussing some of the historic and 
controversial issues that caught the attention of those both 
on Capitol Hill and in homes across America.  These issues 
ranged from life to teen drug use to welfare reform to 
parental rights.

<p>

Tonight's guests worked consistently with our 
Senators and Congressman, dispensing crucial research 
information to ensure that the best arguments supporting 
pro-family viewpoints were heard.  You won't want to miss 
this key overview of your 104th Congress.

<p>

But first, we are taking you to an event which 
included some of the most prominent faith and family leaders 
in America today. They gathered in Senate majority leader 
Trent Lott's office to speak for life.  Protestant, 
Catholic, and Jewish voices blended as they urged Senators 
to override Bill Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban Act. This act would have protected viable 
children killed viciously moments from birth with a stab to 
the base of the skull.

<p>

The House voted to overturn President Clinton's 
veto.  After powerful debate, the Senate did not.  As you 
hear these leaders speak, you will understand why the fight 
for life is so intense and urgent.  And it's not about 
politics; it's about the kind of people we are.  Let's all 
take a look Behind the Headlines.

<p>

</center>

<p>

[Segments from the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban
Press Conference held September 26, 1996, follow:]

<p>

SENATOR TRENT LOTT: We have a great delegation of 
leaders here in this room that are going to make some 
comments on the vote that we are going to have today on 
overriding the President's veto of the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban.  This was a tragic mistake by the President, 
because this is a horrible, tragic procedure.

<p>

We are going to have this vote in the Senate this 
afternoon at 3:30, after continued debate this morning and 
about an hour and a half for closing debate, and then we 
will have a vote that will tell us a lot about the 
conscience of America.

<p>

This is not a regional issue.  This is not an 
issue that is affected by sex or race or by philosophy or by 
party.  This should be a vote of the heart and conscience.  
This horrible procedure is not rare, and it is murder of the 
worst kind.

<p>

We are not interested in this as a political 
issue.  We are interested in this because it is absolutely 
the right thing to do, and that is to override this veto.

<p>

So I am very pleased to be here with this 
distinguished delegation.  I want to thank them for taking 
the time to be here with us to support our effort to do the 
right thing in ending this procedure.

<p>

I want to thank especially Rick Santorum, a great 
Senator from Pennsylvania, that has taken this to heart and 
has taken it across america.  He has changed this debate.  
His efforts had an impact on the tremendous veto override 
vote in the House and are having (an impact on the) vote in 
the Senate, but more importantly, it is having an effect on 
people's minds and hearts all across America.  Thank you, 
Rick Santorum, for your work.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

SENATOR DON NICKLES: We need to recognize that we 
have laws in the land that protect endangered species, and 
if people kill the unborn of endangered species, they can be 
fined up to $50,000; they would be imprisoned for a year.  
And yet this procedure happens, and as Senator Lott 
mentioned, it is not rare.  It happens thousands of times, 
not a few times, not a couple of times.  It happens 
thousands of times across the country.

<p>

And, also, I will just mention that medical 
professionals have said it is never necessary.  President 
Clinton was wrong, maybe had wrong information, but it is 
never, never necessary for the health of the mother or to 
protect her fertility.  We have had people make that 
statement from respected professionals, C. Everett Koop and 
others, and this really is a vote about life and death.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL ANTHONY BEVILACQUA: This vote is 
critical for the preservation of this Nation, of our 
civilization.  As you have heard, partial-birth abortion is 
four-fifths birth and one-fifth abortion.  The child is but 
a few seconds, a few inches, away from full birth.  That 
means it is only a few seconds, a few inches, away from 
being legal infanticide.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

DR. JAMES DOBSON: You may remember in the 1980s a 
little girl named Jessica, a little toddler, fell down a 
well in Midland, Texas, and was trapped there, and a frantic 
effort to get her out began.  As I recall, for nearly 80 
hours they worked to get that little girl out.

<p>

The entire country held its breath while they 
struggled to save the life of this child, and I wept when I 
saw that child come out of that hole in the ground, and so 
did so many others.  Why?  Because of the worth of a single 
child, one child worth more than the possessions of the 
entire world in our viewpoint.

<p>

We are talking here not about one child; we are 
talking about what we now know to be thousands and thousands 
of children.

<p>

<p>

MR. CHARLES COLSON: -- and as one of the last 
survivors of Watergate, I have to tell you that I reflect 
back on that now and realize that that was a defining moment 
in the country's history because we decided as a people we 
were not going to suffer unrighteousness in high places.
And so this Nation rose up against that, and the question is 
whether, 20-some years later, we have that same moral 
indignation to rise up again against unrighteousness of the 
most horrid kind imaginable.

<p>

For me, as a Christian, I would have to say this 
with a heavy heart, but I believe if this veto is not 
overridden, that this Nation will be sanctioning 
infanticide, and a nation which sanctions infanticide is no 
better morally than China, no better morally than Nazi 
Germany was during the 1930s.

<p>

Those of us who are believing Christians, who put 
their first allegiance in the God of our fathers and Jesus 
Christ, could no longer, I believe, lend moral support to a 
government that had lost its moral legitimacy.  I think that 
issue is that serious today.

<p>

I am one who is praying for President Clinton, 
that even as he comes up here to the Capitol, his conscience 
will be stricken, he will realize that he was misinformed, 
change his opinion, and let the Nation rise up and say, 
"This is enough; we are not going to do this."

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

RABBI DANIEL LAPIN: The men and women that make 
up the body of the Jewish community understand that this 
issue has absolutely nothing to do with reproductive rights, 
but it has everything to do with the ongoing process of 
coarsening and vulgarizing American society.  This is 
something that must be stopped if we are not to descend into 
a horrifying and dark abyss.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. RICHARD LAND:  We face a situation where, in 
one operating theater, the doctors and the nurses are 
laboring heroically to save a baby's life moments from 
birth, and in the very next operating theater, they are 
laboring in some cases physically, holding the baby's head 
inside the mother's body until they can execute the child.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. KAY COLE JAMES: Never in my wildest dreams 
did I ever think that we would get to the point in this 
discussion, in this dialogue in America, where the extremist 
elements of the pro-choice movement would push the envelope 
so far that we are not even debating anymore whether it is 
human life; we know in fact that it is a human being.  It is 
a child.

<p>

And now we have taken this debate to the point 
that we actually have to stand here before the American 
people and plead with them that we as a Nation are not going 
to sit back and tolerate having children come down the birth 
canal and have a physician actually insert scissors in a 
very painful procedure that kills a child.

<p>

We are not talking in esoteric terms anymore, 
ladies and gentlemen.  We actually have to be here today to 
say we are talking about children, and they know it.  But 
somehow, somehow, the right to choose has been elevated over 
the right to life.

<p>

In a free and civilized society, there are some 
things about which there ought not to be a choice, and 
killing children as they come down the birth canal is one of 
them.

<p>

I feel like I am in a surreal environment that in 
America today, we have to debate that issue.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MRS. BEVERLY LA HAYE: It was Dr. James 
McMahon(?), who was one of the pioneers of the partial-birth 
abortion procedure, who said after he saw what was 
happening, before the procedure, he said, "Gee, I wish this 
baby could be adopted."

<p>

And why not? Why not let these babies live and 
then let somebody adopt them who could love them and give 
them life, rather than end their life just seconds before 
they have that opportunity?

<p>

If the President truly supports adoption, I 
challenge him to withdraw his veto and to say, "Let's adopt 
these babies and give them a chance to live."

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. WANDA FRANZ: One of the statements that is 
frequently made is that this procedure is only done under 
extreme cases, for cases in which the child is severely 
deformed or has a major medical problem.  However, 
Dr. Martin Haskell, who pioneered the procedure and has 
performed more than 1,000 of these procedures, has stated 
himself that 80 percent of the partial-birth abortions he 
does are purely elective.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BOB DUGAN: Worst of all, the partial-birth 
abortion technique snuffs out the life of a child who is 
literally a somersault away from taking its first breath.  
How can God bless America if we allow this moral outrage to 
become the practice in our land?

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: Every once in a while, a great nation 
is forced to deal with a great issue, with a defining issue 
that says something about who it is, what it is about, 
issues of race, of war, and of life.

<p>

This is one of those defining moments.  This 
moment says something about who we are as a free people.  
The founding fathers said this was a shining city upon a 
hill.  The question in 1996 is open:  Are we still a shining 
city upon a hill?

<p>

Even if this vote is lost today, the issue will 
never go away.  It will stick in our throat.  We are better 
than this.  We are a better people than this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
discuss the consequences of the Senate's vote on partial-birth 
abortion.  Please stay turned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The battle between life and so-called 
choice, now spanning decades, continued most recently 
with partial-birth abortion.  Our guests tonight will 
discuss the implications of votes regarding such life 
issues.

<p>

Here tonight are three members of the Family 
Research Council's Government Relations Department.  I am 
joined by Marty Dannenfelser, assistant to the president for 
government relations; Jacqueline Halbig, congressional 
liaison; and Loralei Gilliam, legislative assistant.  All of 
you, welcome again to the show.

<p>

As you know, we are taking a look at some of the 
most significant votes that we have had, and partial birth, 
Marty, certainly was very powerful and most recent.  What do 
you see as the implications of this vote, which ultimately 
did not prevail, even though there were majorities in the 
House and the Senate?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there were overwhelming 
majorities, particularly in the House, and increasing 
majorities in the Senate.  We went from 54 votes in the 
Senate to effectively 59, despite the 57 votes that were on 
the roll call, and many Senators who did vote against the 
override, I think, were very uncomfortable with that, 
knowing that it was a very unpopular position with the 
public.

<p>

So I think we are going to see further movement on 
that, and we got a two-thirds majority in the House on every 
occasion when the vote came up.  So I think that there is a 
lot of potential for this in the new Congress.  Congressman 
Charles Canady, the chairman of the Constitution 
Subcommittee in the House, has already indicated that he 
will be bringing this up again in the 105th Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like partial-birth abortion 
gave us an opportunity that we never had before to really 
talk about what happens in an abortion itself.  And so you 
have here late-term abortions, often viable children, 
healthy children, a scissors stabbed in the base of the 
skull, brain tissue vacuumed out, and the public 
overwhelmingly, as they become aware of it, saying this is 
horrendous.  I think it was something like 75 percent of 
people thought abortion only happened in cases of rape, 
incest, life of the mother, and then in the first trimester.

<p>

Do you think that partial birth has any positive 
implications in terms of its educational opportunities?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: As you noted, it really does 
cause people to focus on the reality of abortion.  In the 
past we have had so much discussion about euphemisms:  a 
woman's right to choose, keep the government out, and all 
these types of things.  And this really is very stark.  Most 
people don't realize that late-term abortions are allowed in 
this country, that they are allowed for any reason, and 
particularly this, where the baby is in the process of being 
born, I think is shocking to many people when they find out 
that this sort of thing is allowed in our country.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems sometimes like House and 
Senate members are locked into a position before they come.  
They run on a certain platform and then they come and kind 
of vote knee-jerk.  Did this issue help people break out of 
molds?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I think so. You saw people 
like Jim Moran of Virginia, Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, 
people like that, who is the nephew of Ted Kennedy, and when 
you see people like that starting to vote for this, some 
other people who had some pretty hard-line pro-abortion 
positions, it does give them the capacity to say, "This is 
different."  Many of them said, "Well, this was more like 
infanticide than abortion," which in many respects it was.
So it does give them an opportunity to finally cast a vote 
in favor of protecting life.  So that is a step, and 
hopefully, we will get them to look at other forms of 
abortion are just as heinous.

<p>

I think the analogy to what happened in England 
with the slave trade is something that is very instructive.  
William Wilberforce gradually outlawed the different methods 
of bringing the slaves on the boats, and so on, and when he 
forced people to focus on what was going on, how people were 
being held in bondage and treated very shabbily, they 
gradually said no, we can't allow that, and then no, we 
can't allow this other action.  And if people start saying, 
well, we can't allow partial-birth abortion, and then we 
can't allow the dismemberment of children, or we can't allow 
salt-poisoning of children, then perhaps they will start to 
really take a harder look at this abortion issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, that's fantastic.

<p>

Loralei, I know there were some other victories 
for us on the pro-life front.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us a little.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: In the Labor, Health and Human 
Services appropriations bill, we were successful with 
looking at the education process of doctors.  The ACGME, 
which is the Accreditation Council for (Graduate) Medical 
Education, looked at training of abortion as a procedure for 
doctors.

<p>

Senator Coats took the lead on this in the Senate, 
and we were successful in keeping that in to where the 
doctors are not required or the medical schools are not 
required to learn how to perform abortions if they so 
choose.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And again, taxpayer funding was 
involved.  It was amazing to me, Marty, when we were talking 
earlier about the kinds of issues, how many involved 
taxpayer funding issues. Could you go through a couple of 
those for us?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, we renewed some things 
that had been lost in the last Congress.  When President 
Clinton first came in, he had veto threats on a number of 
bills where there had been longstanding restrictions, such 
as with the federal employees' health insurance programs, 
and that restriction, which had been in place for eight 
years, was lost in the last Congress; it was restored in 
this Congress.

<p>

On his third day in office, on the anniversary of 
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> in 1993, he handed down five executive 
memorandums on different abortion policies, one of them 
being a mandate to allow abortions in the military 
hospitals.  Now Congress has legislatively overturned that.

<p>

The District of Columbia prohibition on abortion 
on demand, funding for that, was lost in the last Congress, 
and it was renewed again in this Congress, and we did, of 
course, maintain the Hyde amendment, and as Loralei 
mentioned, the accreditation now so that these colleges that 
train doctors will not be threatened with the loss of 
federal funds if they refuse to be a party to the training 
of abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was really struck by one of the 
things that happened.  We don't often think about human 
research as happening in America.  You think of that as 
being some kind of Nazi phenomenon.  But we actually had to 
have legislation related to human embryo research, the 
creating of human beings for research purposes.

<p>

Loralei, what happened on that?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: We were successful in keeping embryo 
research from being funded.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It doesn't really allow -- they can 
still do some private funding, I guess, Marty, but they 
don't have to --

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: In federally funded programs, 
yes, they cannot be creating live human embryos for the 
purpose of experimentation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which is ironic, because then in 
private programs they can, can they not, go ahead and use 
human beings for the purpose of research?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes. There is some scary stuff 
that is going on out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is there any indication that if 
federal funds would be cut off we might see a little less 
human embryo research?  Although it is almost gruesome to 
think that it is happening.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There might be a little bit, 
but it is important for the Federal Government to at least 
go on record and set the standard that this sort of thing is 
inappropriate, because when it gets federal sanction, it 
makes it that much more credible and acceptable throughout 
the entire society.  So it is an important step to say that 
that type of experimentation on living human beings is 
unacceptable.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We also took a look at funding in 
this session of Congress on international funding of 
abortion, and ironically, we might not have taxpayer-funded 
abortion in the United States, but internationally, that is 
not the case.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: No. You have a situation where 
the under secretary -- I guess his name is Tim Wirth(?) -- 
at the State Department is such a zealot in this area that 
he has a ball in the shape of a globe in his office where he 
keeps condoms, and the whole program has been promoted, and 
they have worked through the United Nations to promote this 
whole agenda.  We have managed to keep the funding in check 
because there are no longer the constraints on giving money 
to organizations that promote abortion as a method of family 
planning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. When <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns, we will bring you more about America's fight for 
family issues within the halls of Congress.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

ROBERT WOODSON: -- but use the considerable 
political and economic strength of churches and churchgoers 
and others to remove the kind of government barriers that 
prohibit faith-based organizations from properly serving 
their own peers.

<p>

REV. RONALD MOORE: -- every individual can find 
work, and whenever they find work, there is a sense of 
dignity.  It develops dignity, it develops accountability, 
it develops responsibility, and their moral and their 
ethical lives are changed, and I'm not talking about 
temporary change; we're talking about a permanent change.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you just witnessed, some very 
controversial topics, such as immigration, affirmative 
action, and welfare reform activated the American public.  
With me to discuss some of those issues are the finest 
government relations staff in town, Family Research 
Council's Marty Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei 
Gilliam.  Welcome back.

<p>

Marty, you all worked a lot on welfare reform, and 
there were some interesting -- people don't often think of 
Family Research Council as being involved in immigration 
policy, but there were a couple of things that caught our 
eye. What happened on these things?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were areas where we 
had some success in a scale-backed form from where we 
started. The welfare area, we wanted to tackle the issue of 
illegitimacy in the area of caps, and so on, and that did 
not survive.  There was a bill that passed the Congress and 
was vetoed by the President that included those types of 
provisions.

<p>

But the ultimate legislation that passed really 
ended the federal entitlement but left things largely to the 
states to design it, and even there, there were waivers that 
were still in place that are still potentially problematic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you tell us a little bit more 
about caps, Jacqueline?  We were taking a look at different 
provisions. What were we hoping for when we got started?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Well, we had pretty strong, high 
hopes, and a lot of those did not prevail, as Marty noted.
But the family caps were designed to stop the process of 
illegitimate births in families, that women kept having 
children out of wedlock and seemingly were rewarded for that 
by increased funding, and so we were trying to cap their 
funding and not allow them to get increased funding for each 
additional child that they had out of wedlock.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But was that a desire -- I mean, it 
almost sounds kind of cold, and I ask this as a straw man 
setup question.  I mean, why caps?  Was that the most 
compassionate answer, and why would it have been?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It seemed to work as far as a few 
experiments that took place.  One was in New Jersey, and it 
seemed to have the positive effect of not rewarding a 
negative action.  If you don't reward a negative action, 
then they won't continue to do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ultimately, what was the best thing, 
Marty, that came out of welfare reform?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think the idea that it 
did end the federal entitlement, and that is probably the 
most significant thing, and it gives much more power back to 
the states.  There have been many states that have been 
taking action that they have to keep coming on bended knee 
to the Department of Health and Human Services looking for 
waivers, and now they pretty much are on their own to design 
these programs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Waivers would be like federal 
permission to try an experiment, to do something different.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Yes, to get a waiver from the 
law dealing with Medicaid funding or some other proposal in 
the welfare area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And so, for the first time, we are 
saying, look, we are not going to automatically give money 
if these situations exist; we are going to try to be smart 
about it. And we can actually do some experiments to try to 
change our situation?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: The idea is to try to phase it 
out at the federal level over a five-year period and then 
allow the states to put stronger work requirements and other 
things in the area of illegitimacy.  One of the areas of 
controversy with the family cap was the question of would 
that lead to increased abortions, and what they resolved was 
to say that states could get an increase if they were able 
to bring down their illegitimacy rate without increasing the 
rate of abortion.  So that was the compromise that was 
reached among people in the pro-family community who had 
some concerns in this area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that was 
interesting this year, Gary Bauer testified on Capitol Hill 
-- President of Family Research Council -- about the 
persecution of Christians as an immigration issue.  I mean, 
we certainly have not really heard much about this in the 
past.

<p>

We have about a minute left, Loralei.  Could you 
tell us a little bit about the status of that?  What is 
happening?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The immigration reform bill just 
went through and was passed and signed, and what it looked 
at is providing asylum.  We ran into women that were trying 
to find asylum here in the United States coming from China, 
having to deal with the human rights violations in their 
home countries.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like forced abortion?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Forced abortion and wanting to get 
out of their situations, and unfortunately, the 
administration was not very supportive of these women, and 
this new immigration reform looks at providing asylum for 
people that are trying to escape human rights violations.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Interesting, and I know in the 
Sudan, crucifixion of Christians, and we will probably hear 
more about this in the next session of Congress; it just got 
started.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will continue our 
discussion on pro-family issues that were debated among 
Congressmen and Senators in the 104th Congress.  Please stay 
with us.

[Segment from PRIDE press conference on drug abuse 
prevention held September 26, 1996, follows:]

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Today marks the fifth straight year 
that we have come before you to announce that teen drug use 
is rising.  In fact, for every illicit drug and tobacco, 
drug use by students, mostly ages 11 through 18, is at the 
highest level PRIDE has ever recorded.  More students are 
using more drugs more frequently, and their use is more hard 
core than we have seen in nine years.

<p>

[Segment from Parental Rights and Responsibilities 
Act staff briefing held June 25, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. PAUL TUCKER: We sent our child to school one 
day with all the expectations that she is going to be going 
to school and there will be no problem, and she was informed 
that she had to go down for a physical examination.  Well, 
she thought, no problem, because my daughter does go to camp 
every summer; we do have physicals every summer for our 
children, and we do have the paperwork filled out and we 
hand that in.

<p>

My daughter decided to leave class early to go 
down to the office to explain to these nurses that she had 
the paperwork filled out, that she really didn't need a 
physical.  When she informed the nurses that she had done 
so, the nurse said, "We have lost your paperwork; you have 
to have the physical."

<p>

My daughter said, "But I already had one."  They 
said, "Well, it's too bad; you have to have one, anyway."
She said, "Well, let me call my mother."  They said, "No.
It doesn't matter what your parents think.  You are going to 
have this physical, anyway.  So it wouldn't matter what your 
mom said."

<p>

[Segments concluded.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Issues such as parental rights and 
teen drug use cut to the heart of families this year, and 
with me tonight are those who ensure factual information 
regarding these issues is provided to those making key 
decisions on Capitol Hill.

<p>

From Family Research Council, I am joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei Gilliam.
Welcome, all, back to the show.

<p>

Jacqueline, you were tracking some of the parental 
rights issues.  What happened that affected parents and the 
way in which they make decisions for their families?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Well, increasingly, we have just seen 
a large usurpation of parental rights in the just regular 
decisions in bringing up their children, like medical 
decisions, educational decisions, like educational choice, 
and just religious decisions.  A lot of ground has been lost 
to the state.

<p>

But this year we worked hard, as our viewers just 
saw, with Paul Tucker.  He had an incredible case where his 
child was brought in and had a gynecological exam, you know, 
for the whole world to see.  She felt very violated, 
obviously, and her parents felt like they had no recourse.

<p>

This is the Parental Rights and Responsibilities 
Act.  This is something that this bill would address.  So we 
are hopeful for next Congress as far as pursuing that 
further.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think what is interesting about 
that was not only did they give these children gynecological 
exams without parental notification or consent -- 

<p>

MS. HALBIG: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  -- when they were confronted, you 
would think the school would be embarrassed and apologize, 
and they said, "Hey, we have a right, because bad parents 
might be out there."

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they were actually coming to legal loggerheads.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right. I mean, whose children are 
they, parents' or the government's?  Apparently, the 
government thinks that those children belong to them, and 
they have acted in such a way.

<p>

The FDA has --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Federal Food and Drug Administration.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: -- thank you -- has just also done 
something that was egregious, or we have just found out 
about it, anyway.  There has been a lady who has been making 
these home drug-testing kits so that parents could test 
their children for drugs.  What in the world is wrong with 
that? That's their right.

<p>

Well, the FDA doesn't seem to think so.  They are 
classifying these drug-testing kits, which include two urine 
sample cups and a label to send it to a lab, they are saying 
that these are a class III medical device, which is the same 
thing as a pacemaker.  Not quite.  It is not on the same 
grounds at all.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A little plastic cup with a lid is --

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It's not quite a pacemaker, and that 
is what they are saying, so this woman who has been peddling 
these drug-testing kits has now come under fire from the FDA 
as if she has really violated the law.  So she is in danger 
of going to prison because she wants to allow parents to 
have the right to test their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. Who are some of the 
groups that have been opposed to parental rights?  You would 
think everyone would be in favor of that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the National Education 
Association is one of the leading ones, and many other self-
styled child advocacy groups in the liberal community.  But 
the National Education Association, particularly in the area 
of education, they don't want parents to have any more say 
in curriculums or anything like that, so they have raised 
all kinds of horror stories about how any kind of parental 
authority is going to disrupt the classroom.

<p>

So that has been a real problem, and they have 
been an obstacle in many areas of providing school choice, 
cutting back on government mandates through the Goals 2000 
program, and so on.  So we see them rear their heads at a 
lot of turns along the way in the pro-family area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it has been interesting, 
too, to see what happened in pornography in the last year.
We have certainly seen some victories in pornography. But 
you look at the Internet, where children can get pornography 
easily, or have been able to, and in an attempt to restrict 
that through the telecom bill, where we were successful, the 
ACLU and others jump in, "Children need pornography," 
apparently.  And so that is a speech issue.

<p>

What else has happened on pornography?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you run into these on-line 
companies that don't like the restrictions, as well, 
and the Microsofts, and they don't like any restrictions in 
the computer area.  So you do run into this libertarian 
group that has strong objections, and we have seen even 
within the conservative community that you run into a few 
people who have those problems.

<p>

But we have made good headway.  When people 
understand what this does to children and what kind of stuff 
is available to children, they do recoil at it, and many 
people do acknowledge that something has to be done.  The 
Senate voted 84 to 16 to pass this telecom restriction, the 
porn-on-the-internet restriction.

<p>

We had another success on getting the pornography 
out of the military as far as the commissaries on military 
bases, that the government should no longer be subsidizing 
that.  So there has been some movement in this area when 
people realize the detrimental effects this has on families.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: There is an additional success that 
just got passed, an amendment tacked onto the omnibus bill, 
which was something that Senator Hatch's staff was able to 
do.  It is an additional protection against child 
pornography on the internet.  It is computer verification -- 
when they take computer pieces of children and splice them 
together to make a whole child, traditionally, those things 
have not been considered real children so that they have 
gotten away with that kind of pornography.  But now they 
won't be able to since this has been amended.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Loralei, you work with our citizen 
action network a lot.  You are a computer guru, and tracking 
what people have to say about these things.  What is the 
constituent action network response to all these computer 
porn issues and some of the child issues that have come up?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The initial reaction is disbelief.
So many families are just getting onto the 
internet/cyberspace activities and buying their new home 
computers and are thrilled with the new tools that it is 
going to provide.  And then they are excited to see their 
kids surfing the internet sites and going on the web and 
learning a great deal.

<p>

But at the same time, these children are able to 
access sites that provide hard-core pornography and are 
shocked by it that there are not any restrictions out there 
for that.

<p>

The telecommunications bill provided (for) the 
first time some kind of regulation going on.  Pornography 
has some form of regulation in every type of media, and this 
has allowed --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Even if it is just a driver's 
license at a video store, so that you are not giving it to 
kids.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Right, and this is going to provide 
a safeguard for these parents.  Our grass roots are very 
pleased with it, and almost it is like a security blanket.  
They are not scared for their kids to turn on their computer 
at home any longer.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know we have been working for a 
long time to defund the Department of Education.  I have 
been in Washington 10 years, and I'm still hoping.  Any 
chance -- you know, there has been a lot of talk of the 
computer being great for home schools or charter schools -- 
any chance that Goals 2000 or educational choice could 
collide and there would be more parental option in our near 
future?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It is probably going to be a 
long battle.  The entrenched bureaucracies and the unions 
are very strong in this area, and they have a lot of support 
in Congress on both sides of the aisle, and it is a tough 
battle.

<p>

But we are making headway.  There are many people 
who support parental choice, particularly many minority 
parents and lower and middle-income parents.  They see 
people at the national level, Presidents and Vice Presidents 
and other leaders of the civil rights community, and so on, 
sending their children to exclusive private schools, and 
they say, "Well, if they can afford to send their kids to 
those schools, why can't I send my kids to a school?  Why 
can't I have the wherewithal to send my kids to a private 
school?"

<p>

That is starting to put some cracks in the armor, 
so to speak, of the coalition that has been trying to limit 
parental choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There has been in Michigan some 
testing, some looking at ways to restructure an educational 
school system, and in New York City, the diocese which has 
consistently said to the New York City schools, "Give us 
your 1,000 poorest, worst-off children; we would be glad to 
educate them."

<p>

Do we see cracks in the armor, or when you all are 
lobbying on Capitol Hill, do the National Education 
Association and teachers' unions have the upper hand?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: They do. In a nutshell, they really 
do have the upper hand.  I don't know how to expound upon 
that, because they just have always -- they have more money 
than we do.  They control teachers, unfortunately, and they 
just have the upper hand as far as their policies are 
concerned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to keep working 
on that.

<p>

More about your family's future when it comes to 
votes made by our congressional leaders when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The 
Defense of Marriage Act, for which the Family Research 
Council held an exclusive briefing, was a victory in both 
the House and Senate.  Yet the homosexual activist agenda 
continues to have a profound impact in Washington.  Here 
again from the Family Research Council I am joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei Gilliam.

<p>

Loralei, you're a southern girl.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: That I am.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's hard to believe, isn't it, that 
we are actually discussing in a law that marriage is between 
a man and a woman and that we had to lobby on this.  What 
was the reaction on the House and Senate when we went up to 
talk about what is marriage?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: It was amazing that we actually had 
to produce a federal piece of legislation, a law, that 
states that marriage is defined by a man and a woman.  But, 
unfortunately, we have cases in Hawaii that are going to the 
Hawaiian Supreme Court for same-sex marriage.

<p>

I don't think it is a new idea that a man and a 
woman create a marriage.  Unfortunately, the homosexual 
agenda, the folks on that side thought that we were trying 
to oppress them by saying that same-sex marriage should not 
be legal.  It's a traditional defense of the traditional 
family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But why would a case in a Hawaii court affect the 
rest of the country?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Well, Article IV of the Constitution 
states that each state would have to recognize a previous 
law in another state.  So if Hawaii passed the ability for 
same-sex marriage, then Texas would have to recognize that 
marriage, even though -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You from Texas know that would not go over.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: That would not go over, especially 
since we have sodomy laws on the books in Texas.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. Sodomy laws are interesting.
A lot of the homosexual activists were going to go for 
sodomy laws and attack them with this legislation.  But, 
Marty, when the votes got to the Hill, did the Congressmen 
and women see the value of voting for marriage?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They seemed to. They were able 
to split the difference in the Senate, though, because they 
had a vote the same day on what was called the Employment 
Nondiscrimination Act, which was a homosexual jobs civil 
rights type of bill that would put homosexual conduct on the 
same level as things like race, and we all know, as Colin 
Powell and others have stated, that they are very different 
things, that race is a benign characteristic that cannot 
change, whereas homosexual behavior is something that is 
changeable, and in fact thousands of people who have been in 
that lifestyle have left the lifestyle.

<p>

Yet Ted Kennedy and others in the Senate were 
determined to make that part of the law, and we have had 
examples when that has happened in other states where it has 
wreaked havoc in the work place where someone who was a 
homosexual, unbeknownst to the employer, did not get a 
promotion and then comes back and says, "Well, you didn't 
promote me because I'm a homosexual," and the employer says, 
"Well, I didn't know you were a homosexual."

<p>

Now, if that person was black, obviously, they 
would know that person was black, and they might have a case 
for saying there was discrimination.  But if the employer 
did not know they were a homosexual, they are really at 
great risk of lawsuits and all kinds of legal action that 
can cause a great deal of problem in the work place.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, it was really interesting.  You 
had the two bills, the Defense of Marriage Act, sort of 
establishing marriage in federal law and allowing the states 
to make their own decisions, going through at the same time 
as a gay civil rights bill.

<p>

I guess the question is, if how you have sex 
becomes a workplace issue, isn't this going to force 
everyone to fill out a form, "This is how I have sex"?  It 
is certainly not going to be apparent when you meet someone.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was one of the 
problems that we pointed out, and some of our friends in the 
Senate pointed out to their colleagues, that you are going 
to then have to start having records to demonstrate that you 
are hiring people, and then in order to have those records,
you have to start asking people, and that really starts 
invading people's privacy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. How do you prove it?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Correct. People don't want to 
be answering questions like that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It would seem very charged, and yet 
the vote was very close.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It was only a one-vote margin, 
50 to 39, and one of the Senators who was absent would have 
supported that, and had he been there, Al Gore would have 
cast the deciding vote to pass that, because the Vice 
President votes to break ties.  So it was a very close vote, 
and Ted Kennedy vows that he'll be back next year and he'll 
be ready to pass that in the Senate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what do you think will happen? 
Do you think they'll have a chance?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it will depend on the 
makeup of the Senate in the new Congress, and that is very 
much up in the air right now.  So I think as people realize 
more the facts about this issue that it will move in our 
direction.  As you know, we had the briefing up on the Hill, 
and we got feedback from people.  They didn't know that this 
was not a characteristic that you're born with.  They didn't 
know that there was another explanation for these sorts of 
issues, that there were thousands of people who leave that 
lifestyle and that there are ministries that help people in 
that situation.  And as they find facts like that out and 
they find out the problems that this can cause in the work 
place, they do tend to take another look at it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, and I 
know that one thing Family Research Council does 
consistently is fight for pro-family tax relief.
Jacqueline, what started in that front?  What did we see?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: We did see pro-family tax relief pass 
the House, and that was pretty exciting, a $500-per-child 
tax credit.  So that was a victory.  Unfortunately, it 
didn't fly in the Senate, but we did at least get that far 
in the House.  So that is encouraging.

<p>

Also along the lines of tax credits, there was an 
adoption tax credit which passed, something we have worked 
very hard for.  Because we are pro-life, we believe children 
should be adopted and give people a break who spend a lot of 
money trying to adopt children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think, what, the average cost of 
adoption is around $20,000, and this was $5,000 tax break?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is really significant for people.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It is significant.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There was one other change in 
adoption law, wasn't there, Loralei?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes. This was the first time that
we were able to get transracial adoptions be approved.
There is not technically a law out there that says one race 
parent could not adopt a different race child, but, 
unfortunately, that was what was happening in the adoption 
agencies.  They were not letting cross-racial adoption 
happen.  And we have put on the books now that, yes, a white 
family can adopt a Hispanic child, or a black family can 
adopt an Oriental child.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And that was something that Hillary 
Clinton and Donna Shalala had fought, as I understand.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to come back 
and hear more about this when the 105th Congress comes.  
Thanks so much for being with us, and when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns, we will bring you more information regarding issues 
affecting you and your family.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.

<p>

Have you ever wondered if women have had an impact 
on our political system; if the fact that women vote changes 
the way the world is, or at least the way the political 
system operates?  During the suffragette movement, when 
women were trying to get the vote, it was rumored that women 
were really going to change American politics, and today the 
gender gap is big news.

<p>

Just how do women view the political process, and 
what influence do they have?  We're going to hear from some 
experts who have a lot to say about how women are 
influencing the American political scene.

<p>

First, we are going to hear from Kay Coles James. 
She was former secretary of HHS in Virginia.  She is now 
head of government at Regent University, and in fact, she 
was once a vice president at Family Research Council.  She 
says that the way that women care about their families 
affects the way they care about politics.  Let's take a look 
at her insightful comments.

<p>

<i>[Note: Remarks of the participants for the 
balance of the telecast are segments from The Heritage 
Foundation Conference entitled "Women, Politics, and the 
1996 Elections," held September 27, 1996.]</i>

<p>

MS. JAMES: One media outlet says that there is 
something out there called Soccer Mom, and Soccer Mom is in 
fact the woman that both Bob and Bill are interested in 
dating right now.  She is one whose attentions they are all 
vying for.

<p>

Who is this person called Soccer Mom?  Now, those 
individuals who are doing the scientific polling will tell 
you precisely who she is.  I will only tell you what my 
impressions are of who she is.

<p>

And just for the sake of continuity, I have 
decided to name her, and I only picked this name because it 
is my daughter's, and when I've done this before, I've 
switched names four times within the speech because I forgot 
what I named her.  So let's call her Elizabeth.

<p>

Well, Elizabeth is, let's say, somewhere in her 
thirties.  She is a very active woman.  She is holding down 
a full-time job working outside the home.  She is sandwiched 
between her children and her aging parents.  Elizabeth has a 
lot on her mind.  While there are those in the nation who 
are figuring out how to balance the nation's budget, she is 
trying to figure out how to stretch the paycheck.

<p>

She is so very, very committed to being 
responsible with the family's finances.  She is not late on 
the bills, but boy, can she juggle that budget to make it 
all happen.  She is an incredible woman.  She cares deeply 
about her children, and she is very concerned about the 
future of this nation.

<p>

Now, when we ask Elizabeth how she feels about the 
upcoming election, there are three words that she picked out 
of a list for some research that was done for <i>Ladies' Home 
Journal</i>. She said, when asked to describe her feeling about 
politics, she says there are three adjectives:  frustrated, 
disgusted, and disillusioned.

<p>

I would like to add to that that right now 
Elizabeth is so engrossed in her own life that perhaps, just 
perhaps, even with the election as close as it is, she has 
not yet focused all of her time and attention on what is 
happening in national politics.  Right now Elizabeth is more 
concerned that if Bob could drive carpool for her this 
weekend and Bill could figure out how in the world she is 
going to get home from work, defrost dinner, get one child 
to piano lessons and the other one to a dance recital, then 
perhaps she would have time to concentrate on what they are 
saying.

<p>

My point to you is that I believe that Elizabeth 
and the other Soccer Moms out there are a very fluid group 
right now.  And if our national candidates could learn how 
to reach through the noise of their everyday lives, then 
perhaps they could get to her and persuade her that one of 
the two of them is the best choice to lead this nation.

<p>

Well, this particular Soccer Mom has, well, let's 
say for the sake of argument, a combined family income of
around $30,000, and she works as a loan officer in a bank.
Her husband works for the telephone company.

<p>

I just want to take you through Elizabeth the 
Soccer Mom's day and sort of set the stage for some of the 
things that you will be hearing.

<p>

Elizabeth turns over at 5:30 a.m., and as she 
smashes the clock down because its whining is driving her 
insane -- it came much, much too early, but, you see, she 
has to get up very, very early in order to prepare her 
children, herself, and, yes, her husband, in order to go out 
and face their work day.

<p>

Now, there are some things that are influencing 
Elizabeth's life at that moment that she doesn't even know 
about.  She isn't even aware of the fact that perhaps the 
reason that she is getting up and going out and facing a job 
and working that day is because the economy is as it is, and 
in order for her family to be able to survive, they need 
those two incomes.  And she isn't perhaps aware of the fact 
that while she is working 15 hours out of her week in order 
to pay her taxes and she only gets to spend 17 hours out of 
her week in one-on-one time with her children, that she is 
working almost as much time for the government as she is 
working for her children.  And someone needs to get that 
message through to her, so that when we begin to talk about 
a 15 percent tax cut, Elizabeth understands immediately what 
impact that's going to have on her and on her family.

<p>

Well, Elizabeth rouses those kids and gets them 
ready, and as she readies them for school, she begins to 
think about the kinds and the quality of education that her 
children are getting.  Now, she is very committed to public 
education.  Make no mistake about it.  She wants a good 
quality education in that community.  But her primary and 
her first responsibility is to her own children.  It is very 
important to her that they have the best education possible, 
and she somehow fears that her wealthier friends who can 
send their children to private school are getting a better 
edge, because when she looks at the standardized test 
results, for whatever reason, those children are scoring 
higher.

<p>

Now, she figures if we can get a little 
competition in there and somehow drive this issue, that 
perhaps we can improve the public schools, and Elizabeth 
believes, much like Polly Williams, that Bill Clinton should 
not be the only person who lives in public housing and sends 
his kids to private school.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And she would love to take her tax dollars that 
she is spending, she would love to take that money and use 
it to send her children to the school that she chooses, 
because she understands their unique gifts, abilities, and 
needs, and she wants to make the decision about what kinds 
of education her children receive.  Elizabeth is very 
concerned about what she sees happening in public schools in 
America today.

<p>

And so Elizabeth puts the children in the car, and 
she begins to drive off to drop them off for their day in 
public schools.  She is mortified as she drives through the 
neighborhood and goes through a shortcut to get there and 
cut off a few minutes so she won't be late for work, drives 
through a neighborhood that she doesn't always take to get 
there, and is horrified, mortified, petrified, as she sees 
what she believes to be a drug deal going on not more than a 
few blocks from her child's school.

<p>

Now, Elizabeth is very concerned about crime and 
drugs.  She somehow had gotten a sense of security when she 
saw the data that came out several years ago saying that 
casual use among teenagers was down, and she was glad to 
have Nancy Reagan stand up there and tell the children of 
America, "Just say no."  She wasn't smirking, she wasn't 
making light of drug use, and it was exactly the same 
message that she was giving at home.

<p>

And so she felt a certain amount of security, and 
if Elizabeth had time and was listening to the evening news, 
she knows that the gains that we made under President Bush 
have in fact evaporated and that drug use among teens is up, 
and that is frightening to her, because she cares about her 
children, and she doesn't want leadership in this country 
that says, "Yes," with a smile, "I used drugs, and if I had 
the opportunity, I would do it over again."

<p>

Well, she drops them off.  Finally now, Elizabeth 
is headed to work.  She works very hard all day, and when it 
gets to be lunch time, Elizabeth has several phone calls 
that she needs to make on her break.  You see, as a sandwich 
mom, meaning that she is sandwiched between her children and 
her elderly parents, usually at least two to three times a 
week she tries to call her mom and dad at lunchtime.  And 
when she calls them, her father is horrified, saying, "Have 
you heard what they're trying to do to Medicare?"  He is 
frightened.

<p>

She says, "Dad, think about it this way.  What if 
you had a limited amount of money and you looked ahead to 
the end of the month and you realized, Dad, that if you 
didn't spend your money wisely, you were going to run out of 
money before you got to the end of the month?  Now, you have 
two options, Dad.  You can either begin to cut back and 
scale back and maybe change your diet a little bit, or you 
could decide, 'I'm going to worry about it later; let's have 
steak and lobster for dinner tonight.'"

<p>

And Dad said, "Well, of course not.  I would 
figure out how to make it work, how to stretch the limited 
dollars that I have so that we can eat all month."  And she 
said, "Dad, that's what Republicans are trying to do.  And 
in fact, they are not talking about spending less money on 
the food budget; they are talking about spending more, but 
we are not going to increase it as much and as fast, because 
we simply don't have the resources to do that.

<p>

"Dad, they really do want to save Medicare and to 
make sure that in fact you will always have adequate medical 
coverage."  Elizabeth has a lot on her mind.

<p>

But, you know, her boss comes to her in mid-afternoon 
and says, "You know, we have a little bit of a 
problem in balancing out our books.  We're going to need you 
to stay and work a little late," so that, by the time she 
finally leaves work that night, it's dark outside, the 
streets are a little more quiet than they normally are, and 
she has to walk the two blocks that she has to go to get 
into her car.  She sees shadows as she walks to her car, and 
she is angry that Bill Clinton cut prison funding by $580 
million, because some of those people need to be locked up 
and behind bars.

<p>

And so I think that you are beginning to see that 
there is a lot that is happening at the national level that 
can be, should be, and is indeed important to Elizabeth.

<p>

As she makes it home that night, prepares the 
family's meal, and then sits down to watch the evening news, 
there are two more things that come to her attention.  
Elizabeth looks at what is happening internationally, and 
she recognizes that as she looks at her 17-year-old son and 
thinks about her brother who is a Marine, she is very 
concerned that in America's foreign policy that perhaps, 
just perhaps, we are committing American forces to places on 
our globe with missions that are ill-defined; we aren't sure 
what victory looks like; and we're not really clear why 
we're there.

<p>

And that is important because, see, Elizabeth is 
patriotic, and she has taught her son that he will fight for 
and defend freedom and that one day he may be called upon to 
do just that.  But she wants to be sure that when her son or 
her brother is put in harm's way, that it is for a reason 
that is of some vital interest to America.  And she also 
wants to know that he is the best equipped, that he is the 
best trained, and that he has all the tools and resources at 
his disposal to do the job.  She does not want to be one of 
those mothers of one of the rangers who went into Somalia 
and then later was told that some of the defense officials 
should have acted upon requests that came from some of the 
commanders that they needed more equipment and heavier 
armor.  You see, that would be cold comfort to her.

<p>

She wants to know that America's military is 
standing ready and well prepared.  And so that is important 
to her.  She is concerned about what she hears about 
military morale that has hit an all-time low.  She is very 
concerned as she listens to the evening news that perhaps 
America is not prepared to face the international 
challenges.

<p>

And so Elizabeth may not have focused entirely on 
the election yet, and Bob and Bill may still be courting.  
She will have the opportunity to focus on what that means to 
her in terms of education, in terms of crime, in terms of 
drugs, in terms of a strong national defense, in terms of a 
definable national foreign policy.  Because, you see, 
Elizabeth cares about all those things because, yes, she is 
a woman, but she is also an American.

MS. MAC LEOD: It is very important, as we talk 
about women and politics here in 1996, that we have some 
context to put that into.  We must understand the patterns 
of feminism, we must understand some of the past of feminism 
in order to be put there, and I am really glad to see a lot 
of people that are in my age group, because we are the ones 
who have received a very narrow view as we have been raised 
of the feminist movement.

<p>

I did my graduate thesis on the defeat of the 
Equal Rights Amendment in Iowa in 1992, and the reason I 
chose that topic was because as I talked to people in my age 
group, I discovered that we did not know what the Equal 
Rights Amendment was all about.  We knew there was this 
brouhaha over it when we were young, back in the 1970s, but 
we didn't know what the issues were that surrounded it.  The 
only things we had ever been taught were what we read in our 
textbooks, that the ERA was about equal pay for equal work. 
And, of course, that was not all that the Equal Rights 
Amendment was about.

<p>

So I am starting off today just bringing up a very 
poignant figure in American feminism, a woman named Betty 
Friedan, whom I am sure you have all heard of.  As I started 
working on my thesis, I thought, well, I really need to dive 
into the concepts and the ideologies of feminism to 
understand these women, where they were coming from.

<p>

So I picked up a copy of <i>The Feminine Mystique</i>,
and, of course, believing I would completely disagree with 
everything Betty Friedan said, I began to read. And to my 
horror, I was agreeing with her. And I read, and I read, 
and I remember sitting in the library, and before I knew it, 
I had read 125 pages straight of this book, and I thought, 
Something's wrong.  I'm agreeing with this woman.  I'm not 
supposed to agree with Betty Friedan.

<p>

And so I stepped back and thought, Okay, what is 
it that she accomplished?  I had recently ended a 
relationship, so I knew I was going to be coming out of grad 
school with no strings, no marriage prospects, would be 
heading off into the career world, would be getting a job, 
supporting myself, and I thought, I can identify with the 
things she is saying in this book.  She wrote that book to 
women who were either newly out of school and headed off to 
a career in the 1960s or women who were married, 
intelligent, a lot of them starting out, of course, Smith 
women, who were not fulfilled because they were at home 
doing laundry and changing diapers, and in many cases, that 
is about all they were doing.

<p>

And so she took some very real fears that I 
believe every women who has any education at all and any 
ambition at all faces, she took those fears, and she said, 
"Okay, if you have these concerns" -- and remember, these 
were concerns that all women have -- "then you're a 
feminist, and this is the road that you must travel."

<p>

An entire generation of young women began to read 
her work and began to agree.  "Oh, I agree with her.  I must 
be a feminist."  And that is how a lot of the masses of 
feminism as we know it, as modern feminism, really got 
moving.

<p>

But, of course, we know that the core of the 
feminist movement in the 1960s and 1970s was actually very 
radical.  So we saw this big battle in the 1970s over the 
Equal Rights Amendment, and of course, I don't know how many 
of you realize that the word "woman" does not appear in that 
amendment once.  It wasn't about women.  It was about 
something much deeper. It was about eradicating any gender 
differences and gender roles whatsoever.

<p>

Now, I just got married recently, and I am 
starting to say, anybody who is married knows that there are 
major differences between men and women, which doesn't mean 
we are not equal.  Of course, we believe that men and women 
are equal not only under the law but under God.  But there 
are definite differences.

<p>

Women were given equal rights in the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act and the 1972 Equal Employment Act.  These were 
situations where we didn't need an Equal Rights Amendment.

<p>

Well, the feminists lost in the 1970s.  Women, by 
and large, did not buy into the gender feminist perspective. 
So the feminists were unsuccessful in the 1970s.

<p>

They spent the 1980s taking the Equal Rights 
Amendment battle to the state level.  They fought it state 
by state by state.  Many states, like Illinois, had to fight 
it 12 times in a row.  Then in 1992 we had the last major 
battle on this issue, and that was in Iowa, and once again 
they lost, and once again they lost because American women 
still are not buying into this radical, hardened, gender 
feminist perspective.

<p>

So, today, who are American women?  Well, I will 
give you one example.  We at Concerned Women for America 
really do believe that we represent most American women.  Of 
course, the National Organization for Women wants to tell 
the world that we don't, that we're radical, that we're 
extreme.  I don't really think I look like an extremist, and 
I don't think I look very radical.  But that's what they 
tell the world.

<p>

But we decided to find a polling organization that 
has a good national reputation and say, What do American 
women believe?  Not CWA members.  We want to know what 
American women truly believe.

<p>

We found out that the social issues were the most 
important to American women today.  Fourteen percent said 
that crime was their top issue.  Eight percent said that 
declining moral values were important.

<p>

When we asked women if they considered themselves 
a feminist, 60 percent said no; 26 percent said yes; and 9 
percent said somewhat.  And that fits what is happening with 
the feminist lingo today.  It is getting into this nebulous 
field, and no one is sure what feminism really is anymore.

<p>

People were asked their total favorable view of 
National Organization for Women.  Only 36 percent had a 
favorable view of NOW.  That's very significant.  That's 
something we're not hearing in the media, but it's something 
that's important when you're considering women today and 
their voting patterns.

<p>

I think this was the most exciting statistic for 
us.  We discovered that eight out of ten women said that 
they would rather stay home with their children if they were 
financially able to do it.  It's not that we believe that 
women have to stay home or they should stay home, but we 
keep hearing over and over and over that women have careers 
and that that's more important, and, you know, children, 
just plug them into day care.  But eight out of ten women 
said, "If I could afford to, I would stay home."

<p>

But we have a very conservative group of women in 
this country, women that, when the media talks and says that 
women speak with one voice, they're wrong.  The liberal 
women out there and the conservative women out there exist, 
but they are in two very distinct camps, and as we look 
towards the elections, we need to realize that attaching the 
"women" label to one group no longer suffices.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. CORSO: Right now you can hear of a gender gap 
anywhere from 20 percent to 32 percent.  While men right now 
are statistically even in their vote for Dole or Clinton, 
women by far prefer Bill Clinton.  If you go back to 
Eisenhower, even for Kennedy, women voted more conservative 
then.  For Reagan's 1984 election, women eked out men just 
by two percentage points, 51-49 for Reagan.  However, now, 
as we see, it is anywhere -- 57 is the last I had heard, 57 
percent Clinton, 31 percent Dole, for women.

<p>

Why? Well, first of all, women support government 
programs more.  Government is not a bad thing for them.  
They would like to see it cut back a little bit, but the 
government is a protector.  That is why they look to the 
government.  Men want the government gone.  Big government 
is bad to them.  Big government is what is taking away the 
things that they want, things that they need.  They are more 
concerned with take-home pay and things like that, whereas 
the woman wants to know that the government is going to look 
out for, again, her children.

<p>

She is also very concerned about social spending. 
She wants to know that the government will be able to take 
care of her parents, whereas the husband is concerned about 
his parents -- he is not going to just ship them off, but 
the burden again comes on the wife to make sure not only her 
parents are taken care of but his parents are taken care of, 
also.  That is why she is concerned that the government is 
not going to cut out Medicare.

<p>

Welfare is also important to women.  They agree 
that right now the welfare state is not the way it should 
be, but don't get rid of it.  Trim it.  Cut it back.  Make 
it streamlined.

<p>

Women, though, are much more conservative when it 
comes to cultural value issues, drugs and crime.  Children 
who take drugs are a mother's worst nightmare.  They also 
worry, I am allowing my child to walk to school.  What's 
going to happen on his or her way home?  This is a big, big 
concern.

<p>

Crime is also a concern when it comes to 
punishment.  Women want to see these criminals punished, but 
they also want to see them rehabilitated.  People are not 
generally bad.  A man wants to see the guy put away for as 
long as possible.  That's another huge difference.

<p>

Women want to see the jails restructured, not just 
build more but restructure them, do more in the ways of a 
halfway house, allow a criminal who is not a violent 
offender to come out and try to get him or her back into 
society.  If, however, it is a rapist or it is someone who 
has done any crime towards children, you can throw that out 
the window.  They want that person put away for as long as 
possible.

<p>

Right now the gap, the infamous gender gap, comes 
from not just the big difference between men and females but 
also from the difference between women.  There is a group 
being courted very, very strongly by the Dole and Clinton 
camps.  Anxious white females, instead of angry white males, 
is what they are being called. Or the Soccer Moms.  These 
are suburban, they are married, they work and they stay at 
home, depending.  They have to work because they need the 
second income.  They really do not want to.  They want to 
take their kids to soccer practice.  They want to work for 
the PTA.  They want to volunteer in the library.  However, 
they just can't.  They need the second income.  It makes 
them a little bit bitter.

<p>

Their age ranges from 35 to 54, and their 
household income is about $40,000 and up.  This is perfectly 
the middle class.

<p>

Right now, they are leaning very strongly towards 
Bill Clinton.  They feel that Bill Clinton is not the 
greatest President we've ever had -- they'll never admit to 
that -- but he is the better of the two choices.

<p>

Why are they against Bob Dole?  A lot of it is his 
age.  They all have parents who are hitting the same age 
right now.  They see what their parents go through.  Bill 
Clinton is young.  Bill Clinton is their age.  He has a 
daughter.  He knows what it's like trying to get that 
daughter into ballet school and making sure she gets into 
the right college.  These are the worries and concerns these 
people have.

<p>

Bill Clinton's character is also not that much of 
an issue to these people.  Character is not going to be the 
deciding factor.  They actually may see him a little bit 
better for all the problems that have happened.  He is able 
to stand up to these attacks.  Nothing has stuck to him.  
Therefore, he is just standing tough and bouncing back.

<p>

They also like Hillary. She is someone who is 
standing by her husband.  She is someone who is trying to 
raise Chelsea and having attacks thrown at her left and 
right.  Yet she is still standing there; she is still 
smiling.

<p>

These women also love Elizabeth Dole, so there is 
going to be no head-to-head here between the First Ladies.  
She is someone who, again, is standing by her husband and 
someone who knows the burden of working and trying to take 
care of her family, Bob Dole.

<p>

Women -- you can change.  Republicans can focus 
more towards women, and there are three ways to do this.  
The first way is focus on the children.  Democrats and 
Republicans have always talked about today and all that.  
You will notice now they are talking about the future, our 
children.  Everyone, all women are going to empathize with 
that.

<p>

You also see today that the drug issue has become 
forefront.  Every ad we see is about drugs.  The two camps 
know this is a way to appeal to the women, to allow the 
women to come front and center.

<p>

Women also make up their minds late.  This swing 
voter, this Soccer Mom group, they are leaning towards 
Clinton, but they are not definite.  They could change their 
minds.  And what is going to happen is the way that they 
talk about children, the way they talk about drugs is what 
is going to lean them one way or the other.

<p>

It is also the family.  The family is very 
important.  Family values got played up in 1992.  "Family 
values" as a catch phrase is not going to work.  True 
feeling towards the families, seeing how people, how the 
members of Congress, how Clinton, how Dole react to their 
own families and family problems -- women are not fooled by 
the words; they need to see.  They need to see what these 
people are going to do.

<p>

You can't just talk to women; you have to listen 
to women, also.  Big difference.  Men, you can talk to them. 
Men will listen, they'll sit, they'll think about it, 
they'll go off.  Women have to have a dialogue.  That is 
another big difference.  You can talk to a woman, but if you 
don't give her a chance to talk back to you, then you're 
going to lose that woman right there.

<p>

<p>

MS. BOWMAN: I have been looking at gender issues 
for quite a long time and, as a matter of fact, did my first 
study of gender issues going back to the early survey data 
from the 1930s, and I thought I would talk a little bit 
about the differences that we have seen over time and about 
where we are today.  Of course, there weren't as many 
pollsters in the 1930s as there are today, but they asked, 
actually, I think, perhaps more interesting questions than 
the pollsters are asking today over a broad range of issues 
overall.

<p>

If you look at the data from the 1930s to the 
early 1970s, the pattern appeared to be pretty similar.  
There were some areas where men and women differed 
significantly and many areas where they didn't differ at 
all.  The so-called women's issues, defined very differently 
in that period than they are today, produced hardly any 
differences between men and women.  There are not 
significant differences between men and women today on 
something like abortion.  There are more significant 
differences by age.  But there were also no differences in 
this earlier period.

<p>

From the earliest of survey history, men and women 
have differed very significantly on when it is proper for a 
society to use force, very broadly defined:  sending troops 
abroad, gun control, the death penalty.  If you look back to 
the Persian Gulf War, you can see gender chasms on some 
questions involving, for example, the acceptability of 
civilian casualties, men saying completely acceptable, women 
saying not acceptable.  So this is an area that has always 
differentiated the sexes.

<p>

Another area, in the early period, women were less 
likely to be informed, less likely to have opinions, and I 
think, as Regina said, there is still evidence of that in 
the polls today.  Women are not necessarily less likely to 
be informed; they are clearly lagging indicators in terms of 
making their views known, making up their minds.  If you 
look, for example, at attitudes about Jack Kemp in some of 
the polls, they are more positive than negative among women, 
extraordinarily positive among men.  But over a third to 40 
percent of women don't have an opinion yet about Jack Kemp. 
They are lagging indicators.

<p>

You see this in a number of different areas.
Women took a long time to be convinced that the fundamental 
nature of the Soviet Union had changed.  Men were pretty 
convinced early on.  After Gorbachev, it became clear to 
them that the situation had changed dramatically.

<p>

The economy is a very important issue where women 
tend to be a lagging indicator, perhaps because they are 
more concerned, as Regina said, with families, and those are 
the first things that come to their minds in thinking about 
supporting their families.  But women are much less likely 
to believe, or much slower to believe, that the recession 
has ended, that the economy is getting better, again 
suggesting another fundamental difference.

<p>

But in that early period from 1930 to 1970, that 
was about all that we learned:  differences on the use of 
force, women less likely to have opinions, similarities on 
many issues overall, and no differences on the so-called 
women's issues.

<p>

If you look from 1975 on, new things began to 
appear in the data, and while I think it is dangerous to tie 
attitudinal data to demographic data, clearly, there are 
some links.  Women were coming back into the work force in 
significant numbers after the war experience, when, of 
course, they had been active in the work force and then out 
of the work force for a while.  Coming back in, they were at 
the lowest rung of the economic ladder, first hired, first 
fired, and many of them were heading single families.  So 
the interaction of those demographic trends, I think, 
produced some of the changes that we saw in the attitudinal 
data.

<p>

Some things stayed the same.  Women continued to 
be slower to form firm opinions than did men.  So-called 
women's issues, once again, no differences between men and 
women.

<p>

We saw some new areas that we had not seen before, 
and those are the most important because they are what 
Regina addressed most dramatically.  One, the minor issue:  
women appear to be more risk-averse than men, Shannon Lucid 
notwithstanding.  When Gallup asked the question about 
whether you'd like to ride on the space shuttle, there's a 
35 percentage point difference between men and women on that 
question.  Most women do not want to ride on the space 
shuttle; most men think it would be a great idea to go up 
and give that a try.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But again, you don't see a gap of 35 percentage 
points on many questions in survey research.  This is a 
gender chasm.  So the risk issues -- the location of nuclear 
power plants, chemical additives in food, safety and health 
issues overall -- women appear to be more risk-averse.

<p>

And then the final area that I thought Regina 
covered so well involves attitudes about the proper role of 
government in the society.  Women, by just about every poll 
that I see, favor a stronger role for government.  That 
isn't to say that they want government involved in their 
lives in an overwhelming way, but they do favor a stronger 
role for government.

<p>

I am just going to touch on three questions that 
were asked recently on issues involving government and see 
how you would respond to the questions, and then I will tell 
you how most men and women responded to those questions.

<p>

In early September, CBS and the <i>New York Times</i>
included two questions in their national survey that
underscored the deep skepticism that both sexes have about 
government.  But when asked to assess what kind of an impact 
government has on most people's lives -- is it negative, is 
it positive, or doesn't government have much impact at all? 
-- the national results, 42 percent said the impact of 
government was negative, 32 percent said positive, and 16 
percent said that government didn't have any impact on their 
lives at all.  But women were much more likely to say that 
government had a positive impact than were men.

<p>

Another question in the same poll:  Is government 
doing too many things better left to business and 
individuals, or should government be doing more to solve our 
country's problems?  Think about how you would answer that. 
Well, 62 percent of all Americans said that government was 
doing too much, and 28 percent said that government should 
be doing more, again a pretty clear opinion overall.  But 
once again, women were stronger on the pro-government side. 
Both men and women were negative about government, but 
women favored the government role more strongly than men.

<p>

But when the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> posed a question on 
their September 7-10 poll, they asked people which idea came 
closer to their own idea about government. The first 
statement was, "Government should provide tools to help 
families better their lives, such as education and job 
training."  The other formulation was, "The best thing that 
government can do for families is to cut taxes and allow 
individual families to decide for themselves how to allocate 
their money" -- very much what Bob Dole is talking about in 
trusting the people.

<p>

The overall percentages:  47 percent that 
government should provide tools to help families, 43 percent 
that the best thing government could do was get out -- a 
public pretty evenly split overall, but once again, women 
came down more strongly on the pro-government side.  Again, 
men and women were not overwhelmingly different on these 
questions, but it persists.  It is what we call in survey 
research patterned.  It is always there.  Women take the 
slightly stronger role for government overall.

<p>

So those areas have stood out in the research, and 
I think that is what is driving the gender gap that we are 
seeing in the Presidential-level polling overall.  We don't 
see it as much when you are asked about individual 
congressional races, and I think that that is because 
individual Republican Congressmen have dealt better with a 
lot of these issues in their districts in terms of talking 
about what is on their agenda than perhaps Bob Dole has 
overall.

<p>

But Republicans and conservatives have an enormous 
amount of work to do.  We cannot deny these very significant 
numbers that we are now seeing in this election overall.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. JAMES: Well, you see, politics is a very 
complex game here, and it is also very important for us as 
women to be as sophisticated about how that works, and so 
what that means for me is that not only is it important for 
the issues that I care about, but it is also very important 
for me that I look, as chairs of the various subcommittees, 
that I look for the leadership in the House, so it is 
important for me that Trent Lott stays there.  And if I 
lived in an area where I had two choices -- thankfully, I 
don't -- two bad choices, I would always go for the person 
that is going to keep Trent Lott and Newt there.  I mean, I 
would, because that is important for the overall, global, 
larger picture.  And so we are sophisticated enough to 
understand that and to be able to work with that.

<p>

MS. MILLER: We have talked about depending upon 
the age of the women makes a difference.  We have talked 
about employment status.  What about family status, whether 
they are married or not married, and how does that make a 
difference in voting patterns?  I don't know who wants to 
take a stab at that.

<p>

MS. BOWMAN: There is also a marriage gap, and in 
some surveys it is larger than the gender gap.  It is a 
very, very significant gap, with married voters being more 
Republican and single voters being more Democratic.

<p>

Married voters tend to turn out to vote.  They 
have more of a stake in the society.  We like to say that 
once you get a mortgage, a marriage, and children, that you 
are drawn back into the political process, and that is, I 
think, what the political science literature suggests, and 
clearly, there are significant marriage gaps.

<p>

MS. MAC LEOD:  . . . is when you look at this 
economy, fundamentally, we started in this nation on a 
premise that the family was the thing that would drive the 
economy; and as you have successful families and family 
businesses, you are going to filter that up, and you are 
going to end up having a successful economy.

<p>

So I think there is definitely merit to that as 
far as the families are getting smaller, people aren't 
focusing on family businesses, people aren't thinking about 
the family in terms of the economy in many instances these 
days, just at the grass-roots level, and I think that could 
have an effect.

<p>

As far as for Betty Friedan, I would just say you 
have just exemplified and pointed out the shift that the 
feminist movement has taken.  They hit on the social issues, 
and some of the more radical social issues, for so long, and 
they have suddenly discovered that women, younger women 
today, don't care, because they have never been told they 
can't get a certain kind of job.  They have never been 
discriminated against in any way, shape, or form.  And so 
when they are presented with this radical social agenda, 
they say, "Take a hike.  This doesn't affect me."

<p>

But the economy and their pocketbook is the one 
area that they are still able to have some sway.  So that is 
the direction that feminism, from a policy perspective, has 
been moving in the last few years.

<p>

MS. MILLER: Laurel, I remember the U.N. Fourth 
World Conference.  There are a lot of interesting things 
that they did in terms of the platform, and I do want you to 
mention a couple in terms of how the word "family" and how 
the word "mother" were recrafted, and it did not appear in a 
mainstream press in this country at all.  They just said, 
"We're doing wonderful things for women.  The Hillary 
Clinton speech is really going to uplift women around the 
globe."

<p>

Yet, at the same time -- you made an interesting 
comment about how they've taken this agenda that didn't work 
on the federal level, hasn't worked on the state level; it 
has gone to the international level.  Would you just mention 
a couple of those?

<p>

MS. MAC LEOD: I will give you some wonderful 
examples. Households, family -- they defined family and 
violence against women -- we are seeing a lot lately about 
violence against women, and of course, we are all women, and 
we would say no, we are not in favor of violence against 
women. But this U.N. document defined violence against 
women as always being home-based, and men are the abusers of 
women and children, and that is how this document put it.  
It was an occasion to go man-bashing rather than to address 
real concerns and issues of crime.

<p>

As far as motherhood, they sought to take out the 
word "mother," to remove the word "mother" from the document 
and replace it with "caretaker," or "household."  When they 
are taking about family, they want to talk about household, 
not family, because it is a system now -- and, of course, 
the gender feminism here in the West, especially in the 
United States, is really driving that -- gender, again, 
socially constructed.  They refused to define the word 
"gender" in the document.

<p>

So you have, for all intents and purposes, a 200-
page document that talks about gender all the way through, 
and yet it is never defined, because when push came to shove 
-- and I know Victor Morero(?) was pushed to the wall by 
Congressman Chris Smith in a hearing summer before last -- 
he said, "I'm sorry, we can't define gender as male and 
female, because there are large segments of society that 
believe it is socially constructed."

<p>

That was the position of our United States 
delegation.  That is the position that was maintained in 
Beijing.  There is no definition of gender, which is 
ludicrous.  When you look at any bill here in the United 
States, we have findings for bills in Congress.  We also 
have definitions for terms, because we know that, legally, 
if you don't define your terms, the sky is the limit in how 
they can be implemented.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we stand with the American Family
Association and recognize Pornography Awareness Week.

<p>

Pornography permeates our society in a variety of 
forms, most of which we try to keep from children.  Yet 
pornography has entered a new, more accessible frontier, 
cyberspace.  Child pornography and other hard-core obscenity 
travels through cyberspace at an alarming pace and not only 
reaches children, who are often more adept on the computer 
than their parents, but also abuses children by portraying 
them in a sexual manner.

<p>

In fact, it is not illegal to send a child hard-core filth 
through e-mail or to make it easy for kids to 
find obscene pictures of sex and sexual-mutilation deaths.
Children, women, and men, though pornography addiction, are 
all victims of a multi-million-dollar pornography industry. 
And it is of particular concern now, because President 
Clinton has pledged to get every school hooked up on the 
Internet, a sometimes dangerous computer playground.
Tonight we talk to two key players in this crucial battle 
against pornography.

<p>

But first, let's talk about the election less than 
one week away.  The majority of U.S. voters are women, whose 
voices both inside and outside the beltway can no longer be 
ignored.  It is important for conservatives and liberals 
alike to learn how to talk to this constituency of women, to 
win their hearts and their votes.

<p>

Let's hear how women at a special Heritage 
Foundation event addressed this gender issue, as we take you 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<p>

[Segments from The Heritage Foundation Conference 
entitled "Women, Politics, and the 1996 Elections," held 
September 27, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MS. BLAIR: In America today, the term "working 
family" is practically an oxymoron.  You can work or you can 
have a family, but it is awfully, awfully hard to have both. 
The reason why that happens is, quite simply, the tax 
burden. The tax burden is what drives the second person in 
the family into the work force, as we have seen from the CWA 
poll, which showed that 80 percent of women, if they could, 
would stay home with their children.

<p>

What drives the tax burden?  It is often called 
women's interests, but what it really is is interest groups' 
interests.  Those are the folks who want to get every 
taxpayer in America to contribute one penny so that they can 
do this good thing, and those pennies add up, and you find 
that you've got folks working very, very hard to pay the 
government and try to manage to have a decent life for 
themselves.

<p>

If you look at the social issues, it seems to me 
that one thing we really cannot deny is that money has not 
solved those problems, and we would all have to acknowledge 
that it is going to be time and attention that solves those 
problems. Unfortunately, the more government we have, the 
more we are simply throwing money at those problems and not 
time and attention; and the more we drive women unwillingly 
into the work force and drive taxes up to take money away 
from families, the more we are simply doing the wrong thing 
for those problems.

<p>

The women who would like to be at home, the women 
who would like to be able to do volunteer work in their 
communities, so they say, would be exactly the people who 
would be doing volunteer work in their communities to help 
these social problems, who would be raising their children 
in a way that they felt confident that the children would 
turn out to be okay and solve some of those social problems.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. ARNETT: Let's listen to what women are 
saying.  And I think that something I am hearing today is, 
as a conservative women, I don't understand why the polls 
show that women are so overwhelmingly supporting Bill 
Clinton, because he stands for everything that I as a 
conservative woman think is contrary to our interests.

<p>

I believe that conservative women are really at 
the critical threshold of being the most important voice and 
the one that is the least heard in this debate, because 
conservative women have a sense of a society in which values 
matter and the individual and the family are the center of 
decisionmaking, not the government; in which there is a 
balance between different levels of government, where 
community service is something that we consider to be 
something that we want to do, where children and the future 
generations are something that we think about every day.

<p>

When you have a government that -- the classic 
quote -- "a government who can give you everything you want 
is a government who can take away everything you have," and 
there is just this disconnect with women being concerned 
about the future, being compassionate, wanting security, and 
yet all of the programs that have been shown by liberal 
agendas in which government controls the center of power are 
against the things that women most, in my sense, value.

<p>

So I think, as conservative women, we have an 
obligation to help others understand the consequences of 
these government policies.  And I also think women, in a lot 
of ways, are the ones who suffer most right now from the 
policy fixes that we most need.

<p>

The taxation and the tax treatment of health 
insurance is a tremendous problem that drives many of the 
distortions that we see in the current system.  For example, 
let's take two people, one woman who is working two jobs -- 
she may be divorced, she may be a single mom -- with two 
kids, and she doesn't have health insurance.  She is 
working. She is trying to provide for herself, for her 
family. She has stretched time and resources absolutely to 
the limit. She doesn't have health insurance, but she still 
has to pay her taxes.

<p>

She works at a company as maybe a temp, and the 
chief executive officer has this incredibly generous health 
insurance policy.  The reason for that is that the only way 
you can get a generous tax break for health insurance is if 
your employer buys the policy for you.  And so you wind up 
with this incredible, incredible distortion at the center of 
our health care system that costs $100 billion a year in tax 
benefits, in which the chief executive of a company can get 
all of his medical bills paid, absolutely everything, 
probably time at a spa, mountain climbing, all part of a 
health plan.

<p>

And here is this woman who is paying her taxes and 
working as hard as she possibly can.  She doesn't have 
health insurance.  The only way that she can get health 
insurance is to either go on welfare so she can get Medicaid 
or to try to get a job that pays generous enough benefits so 
she can get health insurance.

<p>

That is a terrible problem, where you have this 
woman paying taxes to subsidize health insurance for the 
chief executive officer so he can have this generous health 
benefit plan.  That is the kind of invisible problem in the 
current system that, if women knew about that, they would be 
outraged.

<p>

On taxes, we did a little chart here -- I should 
have brought it as an overhead to show you -- that shows 
that the average family pays more in taxes than it spends 
for food, shelter, transportation, and clothing combined.  
If you visualize a bar chart in which state and local taxes 
are a higher line than those four other things -- food, 
clothing, shelter/housing, and transportation combined -- 
people don't understand that, because they see the paycheck 
that they get, and they don't understand the reason you're 
having to work a second job, the reason you're having to be 
in the work place instead of being home where you want to 
be, raising your children, as eight of ten women say they 
want to do, is because you have to pay all these taxes.

<p>

Government security, the security that you say you 
want from government, is the very reason that your life is 
being so disrupted by a government that is seeping in in its 
power and authority to either take away the resources and 
the authority that you have or to pretend to give you 
something on one hand but to take two handfuls out on the 
other side.

<p>

That kind of education, I believe, as conservative 
women, we have a responsibility to help other people 
understand that government security and compassion and the 
sense of being in control of your own life is not something 
that can come from Washington.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. SILBERMAN: I believe that conservatives are 
somewhat tone-deaf in the way that they relate to American 
women and the American people.

<p>

I don't know whether you all have noticed, as I 
have, in the last few weeks, there have been pundits on all 
sides of the ideological spectrum (who) having been talking 
about the "feminization of American politics" in relation to 
the gender gap.

<p>

I am absolutely fascinated by this, and I think it 
behooves conservatives to spend some time figuring out the 
whys and wherefores of this phenomenon, because it 
absolutely is a phenomenon.

<p>

At first blush, I think, to speak of the 
feminization of American politics is counterintuitive to the 
principles which many of my friends take as an article of 
faith, and that is that one's gender should not dictate 
one's ideology and that having a uterus does not 
automatically mean that you are a liberal.

<p>

It seems to me that the gender gap's inescapable 
concomitant is the feminization of American political 
discourse, and I have come to believe that both the gender 
gap and the feminization of our politics have resulted from 
the fact that conservatives are tone-deaf, and that 
everything that people hear in the media and from our 
culture really reflects the resonance of the liberal point 
of view, because conservatives just don't know how to talk 
to people.

<p>

[Segments concluded.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, we'll talk to those 
in the fight against pornography, as <i>Straight Talk</i> observes 
Pornography Awareness Week.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. For more than a decade, the 
American Family Association has declared Pornography 
Awareness Week.  To help us understand why this week is so 
crucial, I am joined by two of those who have worked 
together in the battle against the multi-million-dollar 
pornography industry.  I would like to welcome Dee Jepsen, 
president of Enough is Enough, and Cathy Cleaver, the Family 
Research Council's director of legal policy.  Welcome to the 
show.

<p>

You all have been working on this issue for a long 
time, and why is that?  I think a lot of people think, well, 
I've seen some naked pictures and it hasn't really had an 
effect on me.  Why do we even need to be concerned about 
pornography?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, first of all, the material that 
we are talking about is illegal material, and it has a very 
harmful effect upon society in general, and specifically, we 
have a great concern for children.

<p>

Today, with the availability of this material via 
the Internet, through the computers that kids are more 
literate at than most adults, it is a very big problem and 
getting bigger.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: We have so many ways in which we 
have seen pornography devastate communities and 
relationships. Sometimes we talk about the victims of 
pornography, and they, of course, include women and 
children, but not just women and children.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Men also are very manipulated by 
pornography, and some don't realize it until they find that 
they have a compulsion to consume it.  So it really has no 
beneficial effect in our society, and we ought to keep 
working to try to push it away from the mainstream and into 
the fringes.

<p>

We have to tolerate some of it, some marginal 
amount, because of our free speech jurisprudence, but we 
don't have to tolerate it in front of our kids and we don't 
have to tolerate it in front of non-consenting adults.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead, Dee.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It is ironic, too, Kristi, that some 
people in our society feel, men feel they should have the 
freedom to have this material.  The irony is that once they 
get addicted to it, which happens quite easily, they are no 
longer in control of that desire to see that material; it is 
in control of them. And we see all kinds of devastation, as 
Cathy mentioned, within family structures, and it becomes 
the hard copy, if you will, of what is playing in the 
theater of their minds, and what you see and what you hear 
does affect how you act.  I mean, that is what education is 
all about.  That is why we have multi-millions and, I am 
sure, billions of dollars spent on advertising in this 
country, to affect action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The scope of pornography -- and 
let's just define it for a second about some of the kinds of 
pornography you are most concerned about -- I mean, a lot of 
people, they think pornography, they think <i>Playboy</i> magazine,
and I am not sure that they are really aware of the kinds of 
material that is available and that there is pornography 
that is actually illegal, because free speech seems to be a 
get-out-of-jail-free card, you know, in our society. It's a 
speech issue, so we can't stop anything.

<p>

But, Cathy, you are a lawyer.  How do the courts 
define what is illegal pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Well, the word "pornography" is not 
a legal term.  Pornography refers to any representation that 
is designed to arouse the viewer.  But then we move beyond 
the general definition into the legal terms.  There is a 
term called "obscenity," and what that doesn't mean -- 
people think that means foul speech.  It can include foul 
speech, but what obscenity is is the hard-core pornography 
that the Supreme Court says deserves no legal protection.  
The First Amendment does not protect obscenity or hard-core 
pornography.  Adults can't trade in it; they certainly can't 
give it to kids; they can't export it or import it; you 
can't sell it or buy it.

<p>

So obscenity, hard-core pornography, and that 
would be the XXX type of material or worse, simply is not a 
legal commodity.  It's like drugs:  it's illegal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's like bestiality, torture -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Mutilation. Child pornography, of 
course, is a form of it, but all kinds of really bizarre 
behavior involving numerous men, women, animals.  It is 
beyond description.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is the deviant -- things people 
that aren't into this wouldn't even imagine.  It is beyond 
the imagination.  But then you look at the category of 
things, examples of which might be <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i>.
Those types of things have been deemed by the courts -- we 
don't always agree with this -- as being legal for adults 
but illegal for kids, and that would be legal pornography.
It is not obscene, but it can be characterized certainly as 
pornography.  And those things, we are allowed as citizens 
to enact laws or to encourage our legislators to enact laws 
to restrict the sale of these things, but we cannot prevent 
adults completely from getting them.  So that would be the 
second category of pornography.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Dee, you had a long and prestigious 
career before you came to Enough is Enough, which truly 
focuses on the hardest kind of pornography.  But what is the 
scope of pornography?  This is Pornography Awareness Week.
How many lives are touched by it?  How much money is 
involved?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, we have always said, in recent 
years it is an $8 billion to $10 billion a year industry.
With the advent of the computer and the Internet as the new 
delivery system, I imagine those figures now have changed 
quite a bit. It is hard to measure. But the effect that it 
has had in human life is beyond measurement.  You know, we 
get letters, and we look into the faces and the hearts of 
people every day in one way or another that have been harmed 
by it.

<p>

Children who were molested, and one of the major 
tools in that molestation was pornography, will have a pain, 
a hurt in their heart that, even if they go through 
counseling and healing, there will always be a scar from it 
all their life. Ofttimes people that molest children were 
molested as children, not always certainly, but that is a 
factor.  Sometimes people turn to self-abuse because of 
misplaced guilt or low self-esteem.

<p>

It has a huge effect upon society, and I think it 
is even bigger than that, because it is a devaluation of 
human life, and there is no respect because there is no love 
involved.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have certainly read in some of the 
literature on pornography that it encourages -- you know, if 
men see women as objects and they need these kinds of 
devices to become aroused, I mean, eventually, you can't 
have a healthy relationship if you can't see women as 
anything other than something that is a tool.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: That is interesting.  Just this 
year, a psychiatrist named Dr. Gary Brooks has come out with 
a book that I would recommend called <i>The Centerfold
Syndrome</i>. It talks about how society is perpetuating and 
helping perpetuate the myth of the centerfold as the ideal 
woman, and all other women as being inadequate.  And men are 
manipulated by this, the result of which is inability to 
have intimacy with real women.

<p>

It is a fascinating book.  He is by no means any 
sort of conservative or religious leader.  He is a 
psychiatrist who has counseled men for many years about 
their issues of masculinity, and he has come out with this, 
and many people are angry with him.  The ACLU and others 
think he is a fraud.  But some feminist groups are taking 
note and saying, yes, that is what we have been trying to 
say all along.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, you know, every feminist, every 
religious, every non-religious, every moderate, every 
conservative, every liberal woman in this country ought to 
agree on this issue, and caring men should, also.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And I think they do.

<p>

We are going to want to hear more about this and 
what happens with children when we come back. When <i>Straight 
Talk</i> returns, we are going to bring you more about the fight 
to protect our children from hard-core pornography.  Stay 
tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are joining with the 
American Family Association in recognizing Pornography 
Awareness Week.  With me to discuss the need for such a week 
is Dee Jepsen, president of Enough is Enough, and Cathy 
Cleaver, the Family Research Council's director of legal 
policy.  Welcome back.

<p>

We were talking a little bit earlier about the 
effect that pornography has had on men, but pornography, 
Dee, has it not had an effect on crime?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Yes, it really has, and Cathy can 
probably cite some studies about how it has affected areas 
where there is pornography available, sexually oriented 
businesses exist.  But it encourages rape, because a lot of 
this material is showing women being portrayed as being 
overpowered by men and used sexually, and demeaned and 
degraded.

<p>

It also plays a very large role in the molestation 
of children.  It very often, in fact most often, is involved 
in child molestation.  They use it not only for their own 
incitement, but they use it to break down the inhibitions of 
the child, and they use it as an instruction manual to show 
the child what to do.  And then if they photograph or film 
that molestation, producing child pornography therefore, 
they will often use it to blackmail the child into silence.

<p>

So it plays a huge role in that, and it has an 
economic effect upon communities, as well, where this is 
available.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: There are many ways in which the 
impact of pornography has been studied, and you don't 
usually hear a lot about this because there are forces out 
there -- free speech rights, absolutists -- that don't want 
people to really know this, and that is, where there is a 
high consumption of pornography, there is a correlative high 
incidence of rape and sexual attack.  There just simply is.

<p>

Oklahoma City was studied over a four-year period 
in the mid-eighties, and over 130 porn and sex businesses 
were run out of the city, and the rape rate dropped 50 
percent as it was rising in surrounding cities.  There was a 
direct correlation to the amount of pornography that was 
available and that was being consumed by the people of that 
area.

<p>

There are studies upon studies of community values 
and community worth and how housing and businesses and the 
value of that property diminishes immediately as soon as 
porn businesses move in en masse to an area.  You might 
think this is common sense, but it is also good business 
sense.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: There are many ways to approach 
fighting pornography.  There are spiritual, moral, but also 
business and just simple common-sense ways.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, the use of pornography in 
sex crimes, I think, has been really illustrated by the 
National Center on Missing and Exploited Children, which we 
have had on the show before, but just talking about how they 
use that pornography in the same way that men become 
addicted.  You become stimulated, and then you need to 
escalate the kinds of materials -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right. It's an addictive process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is, and a desensitization to the violence of it, and 
then in acting out.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There was some legislation recently, 
Cathy.  It didn't work, but it was interesting, to attempt 
to deal with the fact that pornography is used to act out 
sex crimes in a pattern of use.  Could you tell us about 
that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Sure. A few years ago, we were all 
fighting for the Pornography Victims Compensation Act.  What 
that would have provided would be a tool for people, 
individuals who are harmed by pornography because of either 
an attack or some other personal violence, allowing that 
individual to attempt to prove that this pornography played 
a significant factor in their harm.  That law failed, but I 
wouldn't be surprised if we see that coming up again, 
because it makes a lot of sense.

<p>

When there is a direct business injury because of 
an unreasonable and careless business operation, you can 
recover business damages.  But there is no personal damage 
recovery right now from the ill effects of pornography.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  What I found so interesting 
about that case was it was a case where a gentleman had a 
video, that he would kidnap a woman -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: And imitate the video.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- and imitate the video, actually 
play and stop the video and do that thing to the woman, and 
did this repeatedly.  It was very clear that he was acting 
out that specific video.  And they were not able to do 
anything to the company that had sold him a blueprint for 
murder.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's really what it is, and people 
may not have accepted this idea at the time, but I do think, 
over a period of time -- it takes a while for the public to 
become educated to something.  You think about what has 
happened in a generation as far as smoking is concerned, 
about drinking and driving.  It took 10 or 11 years for 
MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, to bring about a public 
change of heart, a mind-set.

<p>

You have to focus on the problem, and most of 
America hasn't done that because it's not a pleasant topic. 
It is very distasteful, especially as women, to work in 
this area.  But if we don't do it, our children and 
grandchildren will suffer because we haven't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. I know that you all are both 
really concerned because of the Internet and its effect on 
children.  I mean, as easy or difficult as pornography may 
have been to get before, now you can type in a word, a 
single word, like "sex" or "zoo," and get all kinds of 
horrible bestiality or any kind of molestation information 
coming up.

<p>

I was really disturbed to learn recently that 
there are some words on the Internet which are common, like 
"recipe" or the most common words that someone might type 
in, that pornographers have been putting those common words 
on their screens just to bring up the pornography, even if 
their screen has nothing to do with it.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If Clinton really does have the 
Internet in every school in America, what are you all going 
to be concerned about?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, we are very, very concerned.
In fact, Enough is Enough has revised its whole strategic 
plan to focus at this point in time on making the Internet 
safe for children.  That is a huge job, but it is a growing 
technology, and with, as you say, every child being able to 
have access to a computer by the year 2000, which is four 
years away, every parent and grandparent and teacher in this 
country ought to be concerned, and we ought to be doing 
everything we can to address that.

<p>

We feel, frankly, that it is going to take a 
multifaceted approached.  We need tough legislation with 
aggressive law enforcement.  We need an educated public, 
especially parents.  We need a technology industry that 
becomes family-friendly, and I think that is not only a 
civic responsibility, but I think it is a good marketing 
approach, and I think we are going to see more of that as 
time goes by.

<p>

We will need an international coordinated effort 
as time goes by, also, because it is an enormous problem.
It is not just in the United States where there is concern; 
it is growing around the world.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Cathy, I know you and I 
have talked about this on occasion, but there has been a sad 
increase in molestation and rapes of children, of younger 
children, 8-year-olds molesting 4-year-olds and 7-year-olds 
and infants.  I mean, we are really seeing little children 
with not a -- and what has been interesting in some of the 
cases is their arguing that the children did not have 
criminal intent because they didn't understand, although 
they did act out a sexual molestation of a younger child.
Is it accurate to say that pornography on very young 
children has even a stronger effect than on adults?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Well, it can.  It can absolutely 
have a stronger effect, and I think that what this 
highlights is how many liberal activists like to experiment, 
frankly, with our children, experiment with their new 
agenda.

<p>

The American Library Association, for instance, as 
a matter of policy, says it will never use screening 
mechanisms on computers in libraries, even when a child as 
young as 10 years old or younger sits down at that computer.

<p>

In my opinion, that is a reckless disregard for 
children, and that is really experimenting with their lives. 
And then when we see these cases, we can see how truly 
devastating this can be for children.

<p>

There are many other ways in which we sort of 
experiment with children with pornography.  It is absolutely 
dehumanizing.  In the recent case on computer pornography, 
we saw ACLU experts come up on the stand and say, "I show my 
5-year-old hard-core pornography."  This is supposed to be 
some sort of psychologist, sexologist, or something.  And he 
was applauded, and he was one of their star witnesses.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is amazing.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Yes, it sure is.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Now, this is just completely 
unhuman, and we seem to have checked out our common sense at 
the door on some of these issues with kids.

<p>

But pornography can completely ruin a child's 
impression of the world, himself, his body, other people, 
and it's like a poison, and we've got to be careful not to 
feed kids.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're going to have to hear more 
about this in a moment.  Following this commercial break, 
we'll continue our discussion, and we hope you'll stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to talk 
about Pornography Awareness Week is Dee Jepsen, president of 
the Enough is Enough Campaign, and Cathy Cleaver, the Family 
Research Council's director of legal policy.  Welcome back 
again to our show.

<p>

You know, one thing that really struck me about 
the pornography discussions, we have all agreed, on a whole, 
in a society that some information is not appropriate for 
children.  You know, we no more give children guns, even 
though guns are legal in certain settings, or medicines, 
even though certain narcotics are legal in certain settings, 
than we give them pornography.  You can't sell it over a 
counter, or in a video store they couldn't check it out.

<p>

But on the Internet, I was shocked to learn 
recently that it is legal to e-mail a child the most graphic 
obscenity, and there is no law to stop it; that somehow on 
the computer world the law is void or suspended or 
something.  How do we explain that?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It is a very difficult thing to deal 
with, and Cathy might talk about some of the legal 
intricacies of it.  But we have had some victories in recent 
days. We were able to see the Communications Decency Act 
passed.  It is now being challenged in the courts and will 
be going to the Supreme Court.  Cathy probably knows more 
about that than I.  And we also saw a bill pass that made 
computer-generated child pornography illegal, just like 
child pornography per se is illegal.

<p>

Today, you look at modern movies and you see how 
that which you know is not real becomes real before your 
eyes, and they can do that on the computers, and that 
material is still used in the same way that other child 
pornography is used by pedophiles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So, basically, although we know 
there were no dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, they could create 
them.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So if you created children for 
obscene pictures, that also would be illegal.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right. That's right, and this 
material now being available by computer makes every home 
and school and library, every place there is a computer 
outlet hooked to the Internet, a site of delivery or 
distribution for pornography.  That is an appalling 
situation.

<p>

Cathy mentioned earlier about those within the 
library community that do not want to have any kind of 
filter system so children cannot -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that's our taxpayer-funded 
libraries, too.  I mean, let's be clear.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  That's right.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: But some of these very same people 
would be so supportive of trying to create a risk-free 
environment in the area of toys and everything else that 
children are involved with, and they want quality control on 
everything, and I am not knocking that at all.  All I am 
saying is, this is what we are pouring into children's 
minds, and somewhere logic has become convoluted in that 
whole argument.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: We really treat both pornography, 
which we have been struggling with, and now the Internet 
with kid gloves, I think.  In the next few months we are 
going to be seeing at the Supreme Court the ACLU and other 
pornography magazine distributors, their challenge against 
this computer pornography law.  So there are many anti-pornography 
groups -- Enough is Enough, Family Research 
Council, and others -- who are trying to defend this law 
because it makes sense.

<p>

Guccione, the publisher of <i>Penthouse</i>, is now 
filing suit, we understand, against the military anti-pornography 
law, which says that we ought not sell pornography on our military bases.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: At a discounted rate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At a discount to our servicemen, yes.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: So that makes sense.  The law makes 
sense.  The challenge doesn't make any sense.  But it's a 
constant battle.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's where he makes his money.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: That's where he makes his money, so 
it makes sense to him.  There is a battle in our courts 
always, and there is a really a battle for the hearts and 
minds of the people of our society.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, here is an interesting 
counter to that.  Let's look at what has happened in 
television.  You have the President for the V-chip, 
assuming, of course, that the government decides what should 
be blocked as violence.  And you've got all of these so-called 
child advocates favoring pornography and pornography 
distribution, but on the other hand saying we must mandate 
more educational television, and we must govern advertising 
on television for its impact on children; we have to be 
harsher on cigarette and alcohol ads, so that even the 
presence of Joe Camel on a race car is anti-child.

<p>

And these same people who seem to think that Joe 
Camel on a race car will drive children to smoking don't 
think that killing people in a slasher film will have any 
effect on them at all.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is a great example.  That is 
exactly right.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  But I really 
believe, if we talk about it long enough, that the American 
public are finally going to have the light bulb go on, and 
they are going to say, "Wait a minute.  There's something 
wrong here, and we're going to have to do something about 
it."

<p>

You know, homes and libraries and schools across 
this country should be at least installing blocking 
technology, and now there is new technology that can be 
installed, second generation, at the server level.  And we 
are going to be doing everything we can to get that done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We just have a couple minutes left. 
Tell us how people could find out about that.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, one thing they could do is 
contact our office.  That telephone number is 703-278-8343, 
and we could get material to them.  We would be happy to do 
that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There is a little bit of technology. 
I know Cathy has been concerned about how thorough it can 
be, but it would be something.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It should be done.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It's a beginning.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It's a beginning. Many parents have 
decided simply not to have the Internet in their homes if 
they have children.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: We hear it all the time.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: And if I had children, right now, I 
don't think I would have the Internet in my home.  The 
software blocking mechanisms are very inadequate, and it 
only takes one picture to really assault a child.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: And so you might want to consider 
that if you are a parent now with kids, just not bringing 
the Internet in your home until it gets better, until these 
laws start to be enforced.  But at all costs, you ought to 
employ, find out which software blocking program is 
esteemed.  Enough is Enough has some ideas about which ones 
are good programs, and they are a good resource for parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to have people 
call us for that information.

<p>

I would like to thank both of you, and this is not 
over.  I know the court case is going to come up the first 
of the year, and we are going to want to hear back.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will present 
another aspect of how this year's campaigns address women 
and the so-called women's issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

I was fortunate to join the discussion at The 
Heritage Foundation, which you caught a glimpse of earlier 
in the show. These panels showed that there really are no 
kneejerk women's positions, although two issues, education 
and the life issue, are usually played as if there are.
Let's see how those issues unfold as <i>Straight Talk</i> presents 
some Homefront News.

<p>

<p>

[Segment from The Heritage Foundation Conference 
entitled "Women, Politics, and the 1996 Elections," held 
September 27, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I want to just put forward that 
there are two issues that I am going to address that I think 
are fundamental to our natures as women.  Harkening back to 
this obsession with feminine hygiene, I think there is 
something true about women's fundamental physical nature 
that makes you very practical about your children and about 
not just the children that you have but that you could have 
or that other women are having, that we are regularly 
reminded that we are not alone in the world, that we have a 
generation to think about before us and that we come from 
something, and I think it makes women, in particular, very 
practical.

<p>

There are two issues that I wanted to address that 
I think are fundamental issues for their importance to 
women, although I don't want to box them in as women's 
issues, but also the problem with them, from my perspective, 
and that launched me on a heated diatribe with Karen, was 
the way in which they are discussed.

<p>

Those issues that I think are very interesting to 
women are education and life.  And again, because of their 
fundamental connection to our interest in children and to 
our interest in our society's longevity, it is a long-term-thinking 
approach.  Both education and the life issue 
connect us to the future.  Both of them say that we are 
going to be building something and we are concerned about 
it.

<p>

But what irritates me about these two issues is 
that they are described in such kneejerk fashion, and I 
didn't get a chance to ask this question, but I think that 
women, in particular, have to be a little more irritated 
with the way in which the debate goes, because its competing 
slogan -- education, tax thing, you know, education, 
program, education this, education that -- as though somehow 
we are too unintelligent, A, to make our own decisions, B, 
to understand a greater context of the debate.

<p>

And so on the issue of education in general, at 
Family Research Council, I will tell you right up front, we 
think that people are smart enough to choose schools that 
have opportunity, and to take tax dollars and set them up as 
a sacred cow in a school system in which you have no input, 
in which groups like the People for the American Way or the 
American Library Association will label your calling the 
school an act of censorship, not because anything happened 
but because a parent accidentally got involved in the 
process, that somehow this is an offense to the educational 
system because you had a thought about your child's 
education.

<p>

And so what we have tried to do in terms of the 
education debate is say, look, people are intelligent.  They 
can make intelligent decisions, and the education debate is 
so jargon-full and practicality-absent.

<p>

And so what I wanted to say to the Dole campaign, 
if they were listening, is it's not to talk about education 
but to talk about it specifically and with compassion, 
because I don't think that Bill Clinton wins in the 
specifics, but I think sometimes he wins in the compassion, 
that as women we are very concerned about what happens to 
our children, and sometimes the green-eyeshade approach, 
which is a Republican-heavy approach, doesn't cut it for us.

<p>

I am not per se -- I can tell you for myself, if 
the money that my husband and I paid out in tax dollars was 
effective, I probably would be thrown out of the Republican 
Party for saying, "Well, sure, it's a lot, but, you know, 
they're doing something."

<p>

But the problem with a lot of people is they're 
taking a lot of my money and doing nothing.  They're doing 
nothing.  It is not just that my money disappears but that 
it ineffectively disappears.

<p>

I have been working for the end of the Department 
of Education for a long time, and I want to tell you why.
Seven cents out of every dollar spent in the local school 
comes from the Federal Government, but the majority of the 
mandates for education come from the Federal Government.  So 
for a toehold of dollars, we get a barrelful of policies, 
and none of them to our liking.

<p>

We have 150 education programs; 16,200 employees 
here in Washington, D.C.; a budget of more than $3 billion, 
bigger than five other departments, and for that we get 
nothing.  We get nothing.  And what I am arguing is that 
education might be a fundamental interest to us, but if you 
don't explain why what you are doing will help people do 
better, it is insignificant if it is less expensive, and 
that that is a problem with the education debate today.

<p>

In the same token, I am unimpressed with Bill 
Clinton's, "How about $1,500 for a trade school of any 
kind?"  Well, what if I didn't want to do that?  What if I 
had different goals for my money?  Why should Bill Clinton 
dictate for me where I spend my education goals, because 
then the government still is making choices for me.

<p>

The way that we have to talk about education 
today, though, has to be both pragmatic and specific and 
compassionate.  We cannot merely be cutting the dollars.  We 
have to be talking about where they're going to go.

<p>

I, for one, am a gigantic advocate of school 
choice, and you are always seeing people say, "Oh, you're 
going to get people out the process.  They are not going to 
get involved."  We have had several very successful school 
choice programs in the United States that didn't violate 
anyone's wall between church and state.  The first one was 
the GI bill, which educated a generation successfully and 
gave them money to go to the school of their choice, and the 
entire nation prospered.

<p>

The second one had to do with Pell grants and 
other educational grants that went to people to go to the 
school of their choice, and again, a tremendous success from 
choice.

<p>

In the same way -- let's not argue about the 
details today, because maybe we wouldn't all agree -- but 
can we not agree that people can make better choices and 
that it is not just the money but it is the way in which it 
is spent?

<p>

So I am a little annoyed sometimes by everyone 
trying to poke my woman button by mentioning education but 
not taking the time to explain how your program works, 
number one, and whether it is even a better use of my money 
than a couple of ideas that I have, frankly.  And so we have 
to start talking about education issues in a compassionate way.

<p>

And I go to the life issue again.  The research is 
clear, and I can go through the numbers but I will skip 
that, that women are pro-life (more) than men.  Again, I 
think it is a fundamental thing, that we understand 
something about what is happening on that area.  But again, 
I am painted as a caricature of myself in the public debate, 
and I reject it.

<p>

Partial birth, yesterday, I think, a very sad vote 
in which viable, healthy children can be stabbed in the base 
of the skull in the name of choice.  Even if a person is for 
abortion, is there no line that goes too far?  Is this the 
oozy of the NRA, frankly?

<p>

But let me take a look at a different abortion 
issue from the standpoint of a woman, and that is RU-486.
Let's say that you really think there should be abortion 
somewhere along the line.  So let's just say, yeah, we want 
abortions to be safe, legal, and rare, but certainly safe.
So we see the Clinton Administration lobbying for RU-486,
which is a chemical abortifacient.

<p>

This morning on NPR I awoke to the very 
fascinating and meaningless knowledge that, in the 1960s, 
Procter and Gamble developed Olestra, which is a pretend fat 
substitute that they will now use to make potato chips, and 
the consumer groups are going to go to court to stop it 
because it might not be healthy, despite the fact that they 
have been testing it for 30 years.

<p>

And in a six-month test on RU-486 in which we 
don't understand its impact on women's long-term fertility, 
whether these drugs originally designed for cancer and for 
ulcers might build up and be a toxin in your system, whether 
there is any impact on your ability to have future children 
-- we don't know any of this, but you know, because it is 
abortion and it's a "woman's issue," we are going to force 
it through and we're going to have abortion, thank God, with 
this chemical.

<p>

I just want to encourage us in our discussion as 
women of the life issue and of the education issues to put 
our practical and our nature-oriented issues to bear and to 
ask harder questions of people.  I think these two issues 
are powerful as long as we discuss them pragmatically and 
compassionately.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to a special live edition of 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm your 
host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, we will bring you election 
analysis from a family perspective.  What does this split 
decision between the White House and Congress mean about the 
policies that will affect your family?

<p>

We've got some special guests to answer that 
question, but none more important than you, and we'll be 
taking your calls throughout the show.

<p>

With me tonight is former Presidential candidate 
Ambassador Keyes, who is founder and chairman of the board 
of the Declaration Foundation.  He is a syndicated columnist 
and host of his own nationally syndicated radio show, 
<i>America's Wakeup Call</i>.

<p>

Also with us is Marjorie Dannenfelser, the 
president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which is a 
nonpartisan, pro-life political action committee founded to 
help elect pro-life women to public office.

<p>

And another member of the Dannenfelser family 
joins us, her husband Marty, who leads the Family Research 
Council's Government Relations Department.  He heads the 
pro-life fight on Capitol Hill.

<p>

Welcome, each of you, to the show.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I appreciate your joining with us, 
and we will look forward to hearing what our viewers have to 
say to you.

<p>

Ambassador, let's start with you.  As you evaluate 
what just happened in the election -- Bill Clinton has 
returned, the Republicans have the House and Senate -- what 
do you think the take-home message is of the 1996 election?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is pretty clear.
Bob Dole attempted to run a campaign that was strictly based 
on economic issues against a President whose great 
vulnerabilities were on the moral front. It was an insane 
strategy.  I said so for months.

<p>

In the last three weeks, four weeks, he tried to 
shift and talk more about what they called the character 
issues, but it was out of context.  He hadn't addressed the 
moral crisis that this country faces, and so, stupidly, 
pollsters were able to ask people, "Which do you think is 
more important, the issues or character?" when in point of 
fact character is an element of all the important issues, 
and that distinction showed that the homework hadn't been 
done.

<p>

The relationship between America's crisis in the 
family, in the schools, on the streets, the crisis of crime, 
even in the area of health care, you can see the impact of 
behavior that is resulting from the moral breakdown in the 
society.  Every one of these issues is in fact a reflection 
of the moral crisis, and to make a separation between the 
issue of character, the moral issues, and the tremendous 
issues that we face as a people, particularly as they affect 
our family and our kids, this is insane.  But I think it 
reflected the deficiency of the Dole camp.

<p>

On the House side, I think what we saw, however, 
was a confirmation of what began in 1994.  Essentially, the 
conservatism of America was confirmed in this election by a 
President who felt he had to run as a conservative, even if 
it meant lying all the time, and by a Congress that, in the 
end, is in the hands of an even more strongly conservative 
and strongly morally conservative Republican coalition than 
was the case before the election.

<p>

So I think, all told, the outcome of the election 
is a strong message that we had better start taking the 
moral issues seriously.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And everybody was a pro-family 
conservative.  I woke up to NPR one morning, National Public 
Radio, to hear Bill Clinton explain how the liberal, Paul 
Wellstone, is really a conservative.  I thought, boy, 
conservative values really must be playing if Paul thinks he 
has to be one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Marty, when you look at the Congress, do we have a 
more conservative Congress?  It would appear from the 
campaigns, anyway, that everyone is a conservative today.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, on paper, I would say 
certainly the Senate is more pro-family conservative.  You 
might look at who won and who lost in the House and see a 
narrow diminution of the strength in the House.  But you had 
a gap between the House and Senate last time, whereas the 
House was the real stronger body taking the lead on those 
issues, and some of them would get tied up in the Senate.

<p>

So I think the House is probably still 
sufficiently strong to push forward on many of these issues 
and now, hopefully, with some of the House members going 
over to the Senate, like Tim Hutchinson and Sam Brownback 
and so on, to add to that strength, they will be able to 
carry through and send more issues down to Mr. Clinton, who 
will have an opportunity to then show us what a pro-family 
conservative he is by signing some of these bills that we 
heard about on the Christian radio ads, and so on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tim Hutchinson has got to be a great 
story. I mean, here you've got Bill Clinton from Arkansas, 
and then you have, in his own Senate seat, he cannot put a 
Democrat in there.  We get not just a Republican but a 
conservative Republican.  We don't have a William Weld kind 
of Republican in that chair.  What do you make of that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you've had people like 
that getting elected ever since -- in Arkansas -- ever since 
Bill Clinton got elected President.  Mike Huckabee got 
elected lieutenant governor immediately after Bill Clinton, 
and now he is the governor.  He succeeded in the wake of a 
scandal involving the governor.  He was prepared to run for 
that Senate seat himself, but when the incumbent governor 
dropped out, he had to go fill it, and Tim Hutchinson was 
able to step into that void and fill that seat, and the 
trend in Arkansas is very much towards pro-family 
conservatives.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Marjorie, you track the 
pro-life issue, and speaking for myself, personally, I had 
to be disappointed that the pro-life issues, they certainly 
motivate a lot of people at the grass roots, but at the 
Presidential level, there was almost a vacuum.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see on the pro-life 
front in this election?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: On the Presidential level, you 
mean, or on the congressional level?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On any of the levels.  Where is the 
good news for us?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, in several of our 
congressional races, abortion was a very high-profile issue, 
and the Susan B. Anthony List only picks candidates that are 
going to be very aggressive on the issue.  So where there 
are opportunities, our candidates were very forthright.  And 
certainly in some districts it is going to play better; in 
some districts it is just going to play not as well.

<p>

One of our best pieces of news is that Jo Ann 
Emerson, who ran for her husband's open seat in Missouri, 
beat the Emily's List candidate, whose name is Emily 
Firebaugh -- how about that?  And I understand she was.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We really found that when our candidates used 
especially the partial-birth abortion ban issue, which no 
human being alive can be for partial-birth abortions, for 
the first time they had the courage to talk about it, a lot 
of candidates had the courage to talk about it because they 
knew that everyone was behind them, and their opponents were 
in retreat on that issue, because we focused on challenges. 
We were challenging incumbents, and all of them had voted 
against the ban.  So it worked well in those elections.

<p>

The problem was that there was a very concerted 
national effort to oust all those great Republican pro-life 
women who ran and won with our help, and they were 
successful in many cases.  So we had sort of a wash.  Picked 
up two, lost two.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was watching CNN today and was 
very interested to hear that the pro-life issue is not 
influential anymore.  Do we agree with that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there is going to be a 
lot of brainwashing garbage going on in the media right now 
in order to camouflage the truth of this election.  But I 
think that the aim of many things that happened this time 
around on the part of an establishment that included a lot 
of Republicans, meaning no offense, was to try to drive the 
moral issues, not just the pro-life issue but the moral 
issues, out of American politics.  They did not succeed.

<p>

I think there was a concerted effort to do that 
during the Republican primary season.  That failed.  I think 
that it was clear at the convention that an effort was made 
from the podium to lie about the real nature of the 
Republican Party and its issues, and that effort from the 
podium succeeded, with the result that Bob Dole never 
consolidated his base and ran one of the poorest campaigns 
we have ever seen in terms of an ability to consolidate 
support within the Republican ranks.

<p>

So I think that there was thinking that said we 
are going to use this election to get rid of the influence 
of these moral conservatives, and it simply did not work.  
And indeed, I think the election results, particularly with 
the defeat of prominent pro-abortion liberals, as I call 
them, the Colin Powell liberals, like William Weld, like 
Zimmer, I think it really put a wrench in the works of those 
people who had written their stories already about how this 
election proved that the moral issues were no good, the pro-
life issue was no good, Republicans were going to have to 
broaden their base by picking the likes of Susan Molinari 
and Christine Todd Whitman.  All of that is laughable in the 
face of the results of yesterday's election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Northeast was great.  I mean, 
there is Bob Smith, who struggles to a victory, and then 
you've got the Zimmers and the Welds who don't.  I mean, 
Zimmer took Christine's formula.  Marty, what did you think 
about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it was interesting the 
way the networks were so quick to pronounce Bob Smith dead 
last night.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They all projected that he was 
defeated early on in the evening -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They had to resuscitate him.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and he cast himself as Mark 
Twain today, that reports of my death have been greatly 
exaggerated.  But they all made these projections, and here 
was Bob Smith, who had been the champion of the partial-
birth abortion (ban), who had taken heat for talking about 
this on the floor of the Senate, which was not proper.  You 
know, that was not the type of thing you should do on the 
floor of the Senate, after all.  And yet they didn't, in the 
end, really get him.

<p>

And they called another state, the whole state of 
North Carolina, going the other way early in the evening, as 
well, and that came out five points in the opposite 
direction.  So it was very interesting.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I don't know if Bob Smith saw 
it, but I thought that there was a real Providential irony 
in the fact that Bob Dole wanted to be the one who could 
hold a newspaper that had printed a false headline, and to 
do that, he abandoned essentially the prominent position of 
the moral issues.  Bob Smith stuck with those issues, and he 
could have held a copy of the Washington Post that said, 
"Smith Loses."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, he could have.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I mean, God gave him that 
victory because he had stood firm on the right issue.  I 
deeply believe this is true.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to talk more 
about this in a second.  When we return, we will open the 
phone lines so you can join the discussion with tonight's 
very special guests.  You can reach us by the phone, 1-800-
5000-NET, or by fax at 202-544-2405.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
to talk about the election results.  I am joined by 
Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marty Dannenfelser, who heads the 
Family Research Council government relations operation; and 
Marjorie Dannenfelser, who is head of the pro-life PAC, the 
Susan B. Anthony List.  You can call us at 1-800-5000-NET or 
reach us by fax at 202-544-2405. Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Marjorie, I was intrigued by a comment you made at 
the break about what we should have learned about how to 
choose our issues.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. I was just following up 
on what Alan was talking about earlier about how candidates 
choose what they talk about in campaigns, and when they 
decide to open the newspaper and look at whatever poll data 
might happen to be out that day and choose that to talk 
about, they are destined to lose, because it never gets 
below the epidermis and you never reach the heart.

<p>

That is what happened to Bob Dole, and it happens 
to candidates around the country, too.  It is not just on 
the Presidential level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is true.

<p>

We have our first caller on the line.  We have 
Carmen from Flagstaff, Arizona.  Carmen, do you have a 
question for our panel of guests?

<p>

FLAGSTAFF (AZ) CALLER: I have two comments.
Yesterday when I was going to vote, and I asked a lot of 
people that said, "We're not going to vote" -- people in the 
office, people everywhere -- "We're not going to vote.  You 
can buy the electoral votes, so my vote doesn't count."  
They said, "The unions already bought those votes, no matter 
how people vote, so it doesn't really matter." They 
wouldn't even think about going to vote.

<p>

The other comment is that -- I said it in 1992.  
King Solomon said it in the book of Proverbs.  "When the 
wicked are in authority, transgression increases."  So don't 
be too surprised if our moral values go all the way down, we 
see more terrorist attacks, more of everything.  That is 
what has been happening in the last four years.

<p>

But my biggest concern is the electoral vote, what 
people said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's a really good point, Carmen. 
You know, Marty, we were looking at that this morning a 
little bit, about the fact that even though the unions put 
all that money in, and a lot of people had the same idea 
that Carmen did, that a lot of the freshmen survived despite 
$35 million or $40 million worth of onslaught.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They did. They went out there 
and in some cases created a backlash.  They were pointing 
out that this was a lot of money coming in just to distort 
what they had really done. These were outside groups that 
really had no interest in informing their own constituents 
but rather to create this distorted image to the more 
general public, and it did create some backlash in certain 
areas.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there was a concerted 
effort, too, that dovetailed with what the newspapers and 
the television people were doing.  I can't help but think it 
was no accident that you had these wildly exaggerated poll 
numbers, as it turned out, and that in fact the most 
accurate pollster turns out to have been Zogby, who all 
along showed a much tighter race, going at one point to less 
than four percentage points.  And if that had been the kind 
of polling that had been characteristic, then all along it 
would have been portrayed as a tight race with Bob Dole 
fluctuating, and I think we would have seen a very different 
mentality among voters in terms of participation, interest, 
because they would not have had the sense that it was a 
forgone conclusion.

<p>

So the union money plus the media presumption 
about the outcome, I think, helped to induce apathy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it did, too.

<p>

Let's take another quick caller.  We have on the 
line Chuck from Ohio.  Chuck, what do you have to say?

<p>

XENIA (OH) CALLER: Good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi!

<p>

XENIA CALLER: Thanks for taking my call.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for calling.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: I am a conservative Christian. I 
am also a retired UAW member, so I was involved in unions, 
too, and I am just so glad that I am not working now or I 
would really be raising Cain, because I am one of the 40 
percent that voted Republican.

<p>

I saw Mr. Keyes on <i>Cornerstone Live</i> back in March.
Do you remember that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: You were on there with Elizabeth 
Dole, and it was right after your little escapade in 
Atlanta.

<p>

Well, I voted for Buchanan in the primary, but I 
wanted to make two points.  I was just wondering why 
Elizabeth Dole didn't have a little more influence with her 
husband in this partial-birth ban.  Now, I was wondering 
when it was ever going to come up.  It finally came up.  I 
followed him all over the country on satellite, on KU band, 
and he addressed it to just a couple thousand here and a 
couple thousand there.  He never really nationally exploited 
it.

<p>

The other point I would like to make is, right 
after the election last night, on CBS, Dan Rather thinks the 
Republican Party must pull together and move to the center 
and away from the religious right.  I can't see where he is 
coming from.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What is so ironic about that -- I 
want to hear what you have to say about that, Ambassador -- 
but the voting numbers were clear.  I know we have all heard 
them, that the best bloc of the GOP was the people of faith.
I mean, how could Dan Rather say that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: This is why Rather wants us to 
move to the center, so we'll lose all the time.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I was sitting next to, what is his name, Bob 
Fromme(?), I think, who was Torricelli's campaign 
consultant, and he was also responsible for that despicable 
commercial that featured David Duke against the civil rights 
initiative in California.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And his advice to the 
Republican Party is that you had better go with the Whitmans 
and you better leave -- and I hope you'll follow Keyes' 
advice and do all of this moral stuff because then you'll 
lose.  No, it's not true.  They want us to abandon the moral 
issues because then we'll lose consistently, as Dole just 
did, and I think that is what Dan Rather and his cronies are 
up to. They would love to see Republicans behave every time 
the way Dole and Kemp behaved this time because we'll get 
creamed as they got creamed, in the debates and before the 
electorate. That is their wish, that we should do the wrong 
thing. I think if we ignore them and instead build on the 
base of strong moral conservatism, there is a majority 
there, including especially those people, some of whom sat 
out the election this time because they weren't very 
enthused --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, definitely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: -- some of whom we still 
haven't awakened yet to move out of the pews and into the 
voting booth.  But we're going to.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I find it interesting, every 
four years or sometimes even on the two-year cycles, the Dan 
Rathers and people like that have the same conclusions.  
They wring their hands about negative campaigns.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They profess that the 
candidates are not talking about the issues.  But as you 
study the news, you find out that the sound bites of the 
candidates talking about the issues get shorter and shorter. 
I think they averaged about six or seven seconds in this 
most recent campaign cycle.  And then it is the same advice. 
It was the religious right again.  No matter how strong of a 
margin they got with them, they are the ones who were 
causing them this problem.  It is always the same 
conclusion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that Bob Dole and 
Bill Clinton ran the campaign that the media would like -- 
no issues, lots of fluff, absolutely nothing of substance --
and we had the lowest voter turnout since, what, the 1920s?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. About a million dollars 
of consultant fees will pay for that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Their idea of negative is very 
strange, too.  I mean, if you said anything at all, however 
true, about Clinton or about Democrats that brought out a 
lot of the negatives, which are there in the record, then 
that was negative campaigning.  But if you had a filthy 
piece like the Schrum(?) commercial, which basically used 
David Duke in order to do what, produce a 60-second slur 
that called everybody who supported the CCRI a racist, that 
is name calling, but they didn't consider that negative 
campaigning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they paid him to do that, too.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: That is right.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think it is important for 
people to realize how much is working against elected 
officials to do the wrong thing, you know, to make bad 
decisions, even when they are really well grounded in their 
faith when they arrive, they are still going back to their 
districts all the time, everything in Washington trends 
towards making the wrong decisions. The consultants, who 
just basically they worked on a congressional staff once and 
now they have the great position of telling other people 
what to do, I mean, they are not necessarily qualified to 
tell candidates how to run a good campaign. The 
consultants, the atmosphere of Capitol Hill.

<p>

Without the real active involvement of people out 
in the country, that will prevail, without, first of all, 
the faith and then the really active involvement of people 
out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It involves people.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
bring you more about the battle to protect pro-family 
issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
with Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marjorie Dannenfelser, president 
of the Susan B. Anthony List; and political expert Marty 
Dannenfelser of Family Research Council.  And we would also 
like to hear from you, so you can please call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Ambassador, we were just talking about the fact 
that it is not so often that our issues are not advanced; 
they are not even -- you know, no one takes the time.  No 
one wants to do the fight, giving up before we even get 
started.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think you see a lot of 
that.  In fact, it is induced in a way by the media, and 
then it affects the minds of folks.  I thought it was a real 
disease on the Dole campaign, where they seemed very anxious 
to give up, I mean Scott Reed giving an interview to The New 
Yorker a week and a half before the campaign ended, that 
came out the day before the election, saying that, "I told 
Bob Dole every day, I put the poll numbers in front of him 
and said, 'You know, Bob, we might not win this one.'"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I am thinking, what a thing 
for a campaign manager to be doing.  And the very night of 
the election, Nelson Warfield, two hours before the 
California polls closed, issued a statement praising Bob 
Dole for his courage in defeat.  And I am thinking, this is 
crazy, what is he up to?

<p>

But there was this mentality of preemptive 
surrender, and I am glad, actually, that at a personal level 
-- his staff apparently was very defeatist, but Dole went on 
fighting right to the end, and I think his willingness to 
put up a strong fight, not to back off and kind of collapse 
the way, unhappily, Bush did in 1992 was very important in 
helping Republicans to keep the Congress, because it buoyed 
up the party around the country psychologically; it helped a 
lot in California to keep things from getting out of hand 
there; and I think it helped to maintain the sort of 
firewall that prevented Clinton's victory from expanding 
into control of the Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It could have saved the House and Senate.

<p>

We have a caller on the line from historic Valley 
Forge, Pennsylvania.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE (PA) CALLER: Oh, hi.  How are you?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi. Thanks for joining us.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE CALLER: When they wanted the Jews to 
repent, they showed the bodies, shriveled, and when they 
wanted people to send to Ethiopia, they showed the bloated 
bodies.  Why aren't Christians putting up billboards with a 
manger scene, with an empty manger, with the words, "I'm 
sorry, Joseph, we couldn't afford him"?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good point.

<p>

Marjorie, you work on this pro-life issue.  What 
kinds of messages do you find really motivate people when 
you are working on them?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was very touching, 
and that was a beautiful way to put it.

<p>

I find, and we have a unique stance at the Susan 
B. Anthony List among PACs.  We really require of our 
candidates that they do two things, that they project the 
justice of changing laws to protect the unborn, and they 
project the mercy and the compassion that we have to reach 
women where they are.

<p>

I mean, the reality of this issue is that women 
have abortions, and when we have women in public office who 
are talking to women on their own terms and saying that they 
have a sense for where they are -- I mean, I think it is 
very important.  It is very important to have that 
connection, and I think it is important to have women 
discussing it in those terms.

<p>

I think what resonates the most, frankly, just on 
a debate level -- I think that ad is a great idea that the 
caller called in with -- but is, what is it?  You know, 
whenever I am debating the issue, what is an abortion?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are you choosing?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: What is it? I mean, what is 
that "thing"?   You have to address that before you can move 
on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take one more quick caller.
We have on the line Kay from Wyoming.  Kay, do you have a 
question or a comment for our distinguished panel?

<p>

RIVERTON (WY) CALLER: I do. I have a couple 
things.  First of all, on the issues, our issues do not lend 
themselves easily to sound-bite campaigning, and until we 
break through that format that we are permitted, we are 
going to have problems getting our point across.

<p>

Dr. Keyes was pointing out about the polls, and 
you have to remember, the American press uses polls as a 
weapon, not a tool.  They try to use polls to change 
people's opinion or to frame it.  They don't use it for a 
measuring device.

<p>

My question, also, is -- the big question is, did 
the RNC learn anything this time around, and what are they 
going to foist upon us in 2000?  Are we going to have 
another left-leaning candidate and more empty issues?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, hours of conversations have 
gone into that.  I would have to say one thing, though.  I 
think that is the strength of NET as a network, to have an 
expanded conversation, and radio shows like yours.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes. Well, I think with 
respect to the RNC, we are just at the beginning of what is 
going to be, I believe, a very intense battle within the 
Republican Party between the grass roots, which I believe is 
overwhelmingly Reagan conservative -- pro-life, morally 
conservative, fiscally conservative, interested in 
reclaiming power from the central government and rebuilding 
the institutions of local self-government and civil society. 
I think that is the essence of the true conservatism at the 
grass roots in the Republican Party.  That is going to be 
pitted against the party elitists, the people who controlled 
the podium at the convention this time around, the people 
who had planned consistently a strategy aimed at dumping the 
moral issues, at emphasizing money above everything, and at 
trying to promote Colin Powell, Christine Whitman, others 
who basically represent the abandonment of the Republican 
Party's moral heart. We are at the beginning of that 
struggle.

<p>

I think that for the caller and for others around 
the country, what they have to realize, I think, is that in 
the next several years, we are going to have to commit 
ourselves at the grass roots to lighting fires that can be 
seen from every horizon so that nobody in the Republican 
Party structure or leadership can mistake the true sentiment 
that exists in the party at the grass roots, because it is 
going to require a lot of action; it is going to require a 
lot of persistence and perseverance on the part of people 
who are moral conservatives to keep the Republican Party 
where it belongs and to do what is necessary.  By the year 
2000, we must transform the leadership of the party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: On that point, I think the 
caller identifies a problem for pro-family conservatives 
that people in the major news media, the three or four major 
television networks, the newspapers on the Eastern -- you 
know, we know the newspapers, <i>New York Times</i> and others -- 
do not agree with us on these cultural issues.

<p>

But a candidate, particularly a candidate for 
President of the United States, has a unique opportunity to 
speak directly to the people.  Alan Keyes has done that, 
Ronald Reagan did that. Ronald Reagan faced a very hostile 
press.  We do hear some revisionist history from the press 
now about how nice they were to Ronald Reagan.  But those of 
us who remember the Reagan Presidency know otherwise.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Bob Dole and Jack Kemp had that 
opportunity in this campaign, and they had a moderator in 
those debates who was really a very fair-minded journalist 
who gave them some open-ended questions like, "Tell us about 
Clinton's character," or, "Tell us about the moral crisis in 
the country today," between the questioners from the 
audience in the second Presidential (debate), and they had a 
minute and a half or so to articulate these positions, and I 
don't think they did it.  They came around in circles back 
just repeating economic theory and things like that, and it 
was just absurd.

<p>

The other thing is, federal candidates can 
completely control the content of their advertising.  They 
are getting $60 million in federal funds to run a campaign. 
They can choose to do a 30-second spot, they can choose to 
do a one-minute spot, they can choose to do a five-minute, 
or Ross Perot did some half-hour spots, and they can speak 
as short or as long, within certain limits, as they want to, 
and as long as their resources will hold out, they need to 
identify the message and articulate it to the people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to demand that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And Bob Dole obviously didn't 
do that, and he paid the price for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

We're going to have to talk more about this in a 
second.  Following this commercial break, we will continue 
our discussion about yesterday's election results and how 
they affect you.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to discuss 
how yesterday's elections affect pro-family issues is 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, a steadfast leader in the pro-family 
movement, both inside and outside the beltway.  Also with us 
are Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser.  Marjorie is the 
president of the pro-life PAC, the Susan B. Anthony List.
Marty heads Family Research Council's government relations 
efforts.  We are taking your calls at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Coming back, Marty, a lot of us have been talking 
about who is going to be RNC chair.  Haley Barbour says he 
is stepping down.  Is this the kind of power struggle that 
pro-family people need to watch?  Where is the leadership 
going to come from?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there are many different 
factions of people around the country, and people have 
formed their own coalitions.  They will look at who the 
members of the Executive Committee of the Republican 
National Committee are in the 50 states around the country 
and try to formulate a strategy for reaching them.

<p>

I think that is something; if people can have an 
influence on that process, it is probably worth doing.  But 
I don't think we should allow ourselves to become fixated on 
that, because the ultimate way that you nominate a candidate 
is at the grass-roots level, is to send delegates to the 
national convention, and it is the delegates who ultimately 
nominate the candidate -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People who manage leadership.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and then the candidate who 
sets the tone for the party and for the convention and for 
the campaign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Bush tone kind of was in our mouth this time.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I do think it is important, 
though, right now to try to work towards someone who is not 
going to be pushing what was, as I said, a conscious 
strategy of jettisoning the moral issues, which Haley 
Barbour was very open about.  I mean, he went around the 
country telling everybody who would listen for a while there 
that we had to get that pro-life plank out of the platform, 
we had to put these issues aside, and they were divisive, 
and all of this.

<p>

We don't need that.  What we need is someone who 
is going to articulate in a persuasive way the reasons for 
the positions that the Republican Party takes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: TO explain what we believe.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Exactly, and to do it in a way 
that will make sense to people and make them realize that 
the things we talk about are the issues.  They are not 
separate from the issues, as the media tries to imply.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take a quick caller.  We have 
John on the line from the great state of Texas.  John, hi.
Do you have a comment or a question?

<p>

MIDLAND (TX) CALLER: Good evening. How are you 
doing?  I've got a quick comment, and then I've got a 
question for Alan.  I've heard all day long on the radio 
that women voted for Clinton because of abortion rights.  If 
that's true, I really feel sorry for a lot of these women.
I have Catholic friends -- I am Catholic and I even have 
Catholic friends that I know voted for Clinton, and I really 
feel sorry for them.

<p>

Alan, I was also at <i>Cornerstone</i>. I voted for you 
in the primary, and I saw you on TV last night, and you said 
something about you weren't a good speaker and you cheated.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Me?

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Keep on cheating, brother. We love it. We love you.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, I was joking.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Where does your show originate from?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: The show originates from 
Rosslyn, Virginia.  We are on 35 stations now around the 
country and building.  So, hopefully, we will reach into 
your area sometime soon.  I hope so.

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Thanks a million for your show.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Can I comment for a minute, 
though, on this gender gap thing?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, the gender gap.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Before we even start to take it 
seriously.  I think it's a phony issue.  I do not believe 
there is a gender gap.  I think the gender gap is in fact a 
false symptom of something else.  And the simple fact of the 
matter, which nobody wants to really dwell on but which is 
the truth, is this:  Take Hispanic and black women out of 
the mix, and the gender gap evaporates.  It is not there.

<p>

And what does that mean?  It means you don't have 
a gender gap.  The gender gap is actually a symptom of the 
fact that we have large minority groups, Hispanics and 
blacks, who are captives of the Democratic Party; that 
amongst the white electorate, Republicans and Democrats 
compete pretty evenly still in terms of their ability to win 
the allegiance of voters; but that when you continue to get 
these lopsided majorities amongst Hispanics and blacks for 
Democrats, that produces a distorted outcome.

<p>

I think that is a very telling fact.  I am going 
to refuse to talk about this gender gap thing anymore 
because I think it is all a lie.  If one alteration makes 
the gap go away, that means that the true cause of the gap 
is not gender, it is something else, and this something else 
in this particular case is in fact racial politics, the 
politics of terrorizing minorities, which I think has been 
once again practiced in this election year by the Democrats.

<p>

But I also think it is going to change, because 
the Democrats have lost their base in the Congress which 
they used to buy off the leadership in the minority 
communities, and I think, over time, without the gravy 
train, they are going to have a very hard time continuing to 
dangle things they can't deliver in front of a coopted 
leadership, and people in the community are going to say, 
"Well, wait a minute.  We'd better start making our peace 
with these Republicans because, otherwise, we won't be part 
of the political process anymore."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is a fascinating analysis, 
because in <i>USA Today</i> and a Wirthlin poll I saw today all 
agree with that statement that you just made, that when you 
take minority women out, all the other things kind of break 
out evenly.

<p>

And in fact, Marty, is it not accurate that we 
have seen women more pro-life than men, generally, that 
women are more motivated for their concern for life?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There are. There are more 
women who seem to vote on that issue, but on balance, more 
of those women vote on the pro-life side than on the other 
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I don't know.  I think it is 
tremendously insulting to women to say that if you are of a 
certain gender, you are automatically going to vote -- you 
are going to have this opinion on this, this opinion.  We 
are thinking individuals that differ on all sorts of things, 
and it is more -- my vote has more to do with my core 
beliefs, what I believe in; also, my situation.  We have a 
family.  You know, things like that, not because I am a 
woman, because I am a human being.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think you are right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: You know, the thing that I 
found striking, two things were true.  One, the lie about 
the gender gap very much influenced the thinking of the 
strategists in the Dole campaign to such an extent that they 
made foolish errors. The Susan Molinari pick was the 
stupidest thing they could have done for keynote speaker, 
except maybe for Colin Powell.  But why?  Because they 
wanted to reach out to Catholics. And what did they do? 
They put a pro-abortion Catholic on the podium who 
absolutely insulted the convictions and work of the 
Catholics who would lean toward Republicans because of their 
pro-life sentiment.  It was insane.

<p>

So Bob Dole ended up getting all the votes of pro-abortion Catholic 
women, right?  That's why he won the election.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: That's right, absolutely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: He couldn't get those votes, 
but the votes he could have gotten, the strongly committed 
pro-life Catholics, were instead insulted by this notion 
that a pro-abortion speaker speaks for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: See, that is what is funny about 
that.  There was no big tent until Ronald Reagan pulled in 
pro-life Catholics and working-class Americans who felt that 
the Democratic Party was becoming liberal and insulting to 
their values.

<p>

The big tent -- I mean, you hear the Haley 
Barbours and Romsfields(?) of the world talking about it.
You would think they created it rather than they just 
benefitted from coming under the flaps.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, they didn't even 
understand it.  They are still talking as if the big tent 
has something to do with money.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And it does not. The big tent 
had to do with the fact that the moral culture of the 
Democratic Party was hijacked by radical left-wingers who 
moved away from the traditional values of the American 
people and lost a lot of people amongst the union workers, 
amongst the ethnic groups, amongst the Catholics, who simply 
were not going to abandon their faith and their principles.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We will come back in a second.  When 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take more calls and continue 
our discussion with tonight's special guests.  Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to tonight's live 
edition of <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
I am honored to be joined by Ambassador Alan Keyes and 
Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser, both long-term political experts.

<p>

We would also like to hear from you.  You can 
reach us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

We have a caller on the line, Robert from 
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Robert, hi.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE (NM) CALLER: Well, good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good evening.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: This is the first time I have 
watched your show.  I have watched NET for a while.  But I 
like it so far.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, good. Thanks.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: I have two questions.  One 
you have actually partially answered.  Maybe Alan could add 
more to it.  That is, why did the Catholic vote go the way 
it did?  Two, what do you think is going to happen to the 
Republican hierarchy after actually -- I mean, it is pretty 
much common knowledge that they picked Bob Dole, they gave 
it to him, they got him through the primaries, and he lost 
the White House.

<p>

And then I have a comment, if I may.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why don't you give us your comment 
really fast and then let's get to Alan's answers.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: Oh, okay.  Over the years I 
have dealt and struggled with abortion.  When it first came 
about, I went, "Yippee."  Then as I grew older and wiser, I 
realized that something was wrong here.

<p>

But the argument for abortion has always been, 
you're killing a baby, and that's true.  But I have taken on 
another tactic.  I have looked at these people who are pro-abortion, 
and I said, what gender actually benefits from 
abortion?  And the answer is men.  Men only benefit from it.

<p>

I am beginning to hear a little more about this, 
or talk this way in the media, not very much.  Do you think 
that -- or maybe my suggestion would be that you people 
would take the same course and that abortion does not 
benefit women.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting.  Polling data 
indicates that single men are the biggest proponents of 
abortion, which I think there is a little self-interest 
there.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, definitely.  I think they 
are very anxious to escape their responsibility toward their 
children, and so they are willing to kill the child and 
burden the woman with this awful psychological burden for 
the rest of her life that is involved in this, and we are 
not protecting.

<p>

In terms of the Catholic vote, one, I think we 
always have to remember that we are dealing with a situation 
where Catholics were overwhelmingly voting for Democrats 
until Ronald Reagan came along, and even Reagan's success 
meant that we moved from, what, 20 percent of the Catholic 
vote or less up to around 40, and even during Reagan, this 
is what we reached.  So we are not talking yet, at least, 
about getting the majority of the Catholic vote.

<p>

But I think, as I said, one mistake that was made 
in this election was that Bob Dole thought he was going to 
reach out to Catholics.  They said, "Oh, you've got to reach 
out to the Catholic vote."  And, of course, there was a 
great opportunity.  The Catholic hierarchy, for the first 
time that I can remember, actually came forward in an 
election year against a sitting Democratic President, and 
they were more Catholic than Democrat.  And for those of us 
who are Catholics, this was breathtaking, and I was so 
pleased to see it happen.

<p>

Now, what did that mean?  It meant a great 
opportunity, but to do what?  To reach out to pro-life 
Catholics and pull them in more strongly into the Republican 
cause.  And so what does Bob Dole do?  He chooses Susan 
Molinari, a pro-abortion, outspoken, rabidly pro-abortion 
Catholic, to give the keynote speech, and he thought this 
was going to help him with Catholics.  He's insane.

<p>

What it did, I think, was to take a lot of people, 
and I know, because as I went around the country speaking, I 
have found it infuriated a lot of people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, it did.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: They just felt deeply insulted 
that he simply didn't understand what was going on, who they 
were, and as a result, I think he actually may have hurt 
himself at that point and not really recovered in terms of 
the perceptions of a lot of the pro-life Catholics and I 
think, also, pro-life Christians who were not Catholic, who 
just felt like, what is this man trying to tell us?  Doesn't 
he understand who his people are?  And the answer, I think, 
was, unhappily, no, he did not, or at least his advisers 
didn't.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think that Bob Dole is 
fundamentally an honest and decent person, but his whole 
aura throughout this campaign seemed very calculating.  The 
debate over abortion in the Republican platform was very 
much, now we're going to have it this way, I'm going to do 
it this way, and we have to reach out to the moderate women 
and we can't offend them, so we're going to have this 
tolerance language in there.

<p>

And then he never talked about CCRI for a while 
until, all of a sudden, the last few weeks of the campaign, 
he acknowledged, yeah, we're going to talk about that 
because that's a wedge issue.  And then he didn't answer the 
question when Jim Lehrer asked him about Bill Clinton's 
character during the debate in front of 40 or 50 million 
people, and then he decided to go out on the campaign trail 
and conduct a discussion with the people in his audiences, 
"Should I get tough in the next debate?" and so on.

<p>

Just everything looked so calculating that people 
had to start wondering, well, what does this guy really 
believe in?  I think that is what came across, that every 
position he seemed to be taking was based on some political 
calculation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than on what he believed.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And it may very well be that 
Bill Clinton made his share of calculations, but at least 
when he was out on the stump, he was talking about how 
issues connect with people's personal lives.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Ironic as it may seem, I think 
some people -- and I am not saying they were right in this 
-- but they seem to prefer a sincere liar to an insincere 
honest man.  And I have to tell you that it's a dilemma, 
isn't it?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But don't you think that argues for 
something that I think we would be in agreement about, that 
people should stand up for something?  I think we would call 
them to stand for pro-life, pro-family values, but the 
politicals and the Dan Rathers and the Peter Jenningses say, 
"Don't stand for that much because that really offends 
people," when clearly, it draws them.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think the chief problem 
among candidates is just wanting to be liked.  It is a very 
basic human need.  But if you are not driven by your core 
beliefs, that just takes over.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I also think the media is very 
manipulative, because we were talking earlier about negative 
advertising.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And the truth of the matter is, 
when you actually look at election results, challengers and 
others who are faced with tough fights, they only win when 
they are able to show people that an incumbent is not voting 
their views and values.

<p>

Now, the media calls that negative.  It is 
actually just truth-telling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right. It's a report card.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: If somebody has gone to 
Congress and voted in a way that betrays the values of their 
constituents -- you have liberals like a Barbara Mikulski 
pretending when they go to the Eastern Shore of Maryland 
that they are conservatives and respect family and all of 
this, meanwhile voting for everything that people there 
hate.  Well, if you want to beat somebody like that, you've 
got to tell people what she is about and what she stands 
for.  And they want to stigmatize that as negative 
advertising, and the only time -- the only time -- when that 
sort of thing is really, really bad, in their eyes, and you 
absolutely must not do it is when you are telling the truth 
about Democrats.

<p>

Now, of course, if you do the same thing and fill 
your commercials with lies, which is what the AFL-CIO did, 
they told untruths about the Republican Congress, but that 
was not characterized as negative advertising.  It's 
amazing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't that funny?  Demagoguery was okay.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As long it was on Medicare.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were fortunate the 
Democratic members of Congress, and to a certain extent Bill 
Clinton, that they had surrogates, in a sense, doing their 
dirty work for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Weren't they, though?  They had the union money.

<p>

I would love to talk a little bit more.  I would 
like to thank all my guests, and we are going to have to 
have you back.

<p>

<H2>THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT:<BR>
IT'S TIME TO FREE THE ARTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
After years of debate and attempted reform, it has become clear
that the National Endowment for the Arts is beyond reclamation
and should be zero-budgeted by the 104th Congress. 
<P>
Particularly with regard to the visual arts (drawing, painting
and sculpting) and &quot;performance&quot; arts (theater, film,
live acts), the NEA has been a platform for attacks on religion,
traditional art forms, traditional families and traditional values,
and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.  In the name of
tolerance, it has shown increasing intolerance toward standards
of any kind, including ordinary standards of artistic skill. 
Its peer review process has long been a buddy system for awarding
grants to colleagues, friends and clients of panel members, who
are almost uniformly hostile to traditional culture.   
<P>
However, even if the federal agency did manage to clean up its
act, the entire idea of government sponsorship of art is a bad
one.  Whenever the government decides to subsidize one artist
and not another, the government, in effect, determines what is
art and what is not.
<P>
Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  Its powers derive from its claim
to represent all Americans and its money from mandatory taxes.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement -- a mark
of quality and achievement.&quot;[1]
<P>
And what has the NEA done with this awesome responsibility? 
<P>
Since its founding, the NEA has openly favored the avant-garde
-- defined by <I>Webster's Third New International Unabridged
Dictionary</I> as: &quot;Those who 
create, produce or apply new, original or experimental ideas,
designs, techniques...and sometimes: a group that is extremist,
bizarre, or arty and affected.&quot;[2]  Unfortunately, the NEA seems
to have taken the latter portion of the definition to heart. 
There is a place, of course, for experimental art, but it should
be funded privately, not by taxpayers whose money often is used
to disparage their most deeply held beliefs.
<P>
As a federal agency, the NEA should not be fostering a bias toward
one particular art style over another.  In fact its own grant
guidelines specifically forbid it to do so or attempt to direct
artistic content.[3]
<P>
One reason the NEA has been able to promote bad art without public
scrutiny is that the media are not telling the whole story.  TV
broadcasters and newspapers are restrained by the bounds of good
taste from reproducing the most offensive works funded by the
NEA.  A January 2, 1991 <I>Los Angeles Times </I>article about
an NEA grant to performance artist Karen Finley described her
work only as &quot;strongly feminist in tone.&quot;[4] This leaves
the impression that Finley, who calls herself the &quot;Queen
of Dung,&quot; is controversial merely for being a feminist, not
because of her vulgarities.  
<P>
Because of this kind of obfuscation, most Americans have only
an abstract concept of the works in question.  Senator Jesse Helms,
the NEA's most active critic, has offered to debate the issue
on any TV network providing he can show viewers what is being
debated.  All have refused.  And for good reason.  If NBC-TV actually
aired some NEA-funded works, it would violate Federal Communications
Commission rules against obscenity and risk losing its broadcasting
license.  One federal agency would find itself prosecuting a company
for displaying materials sponsored by another federal agency.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>THE CHAIRMAN'S VIEWS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Under the chairmanship of actress Jane Alexander, the NEA has
not curbed its hostility toward traditional values.  In fact,
Alexander told the homosexual magazine <I>The Advocate</I> that
she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently to
gay themes all across the country. And I mean gently, because
if you start with a kind of very overt thing, people get scared....
 You gently bring in gay people and introduce them to the world
through art.&quot;[5]
<P>
When asked, &quot;What sorts of grants would you reject out of
hand,&quot; Alexander answered: &quot;It's hard to say at this
point if there is any grant that I might reject.&quot;[6]
<P>
Indeed, Alexander later defended a performance in February 1994
at the NEA-funded Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in which an
HIV-positive performer, Ron Athey, sliced into another man's back
with a knife, mopped up the blood with towels and sent them on
clotheslines over the horrified audience.  He also had two female
assistants weave acupuncture needles through his own scalp and,
in turn, pierced the women's cheeks with steel spikes.[7]
<P>
Asked by a reporter what she thought of the performance, Alexander
replied that she trusted the judgment of the Walker management,
and said, &quot;Not all art is for everybody....  Americans are
certainly not used to seeing bloodletting, except in films, and
when it happens in person, it must be surprising.&quot;  Alexander
added that she thought &quot;all appropriate precautions&quot;
regarding health had been taken, &quot;So what are we left with
that was considered controversial?  The sacrification [sic], the
ritual-like aspect?  Is it that the man is homosexual?&quot;[8]
<P>
Congress responded to Alexander's lack of action by cutting $4
million from the NEA budget.  Athey then performed his act at
another NEA-funded theater, New York's P.S. 122.  &quot;With full
knowledge of this,&quot; culture critics David Horowitz and Laurence
Jarvik note, &quot;The NEA again funded both P.S. 122 and the
Walker Art Center in the most recent grant cycle.  Plainly, the
agency is deaf to the concerns of Congress and the public.&quot;[9]
<P>
Some of the more serious problems[10] at the NEA include:
<P>
- Bias against religion; rejecting positive portrayals of religion
as violating the separation of church and state, but funding attacks
on religion as &quot;artistic expression&quot;;
<P>
- Elevation of &quot;freedom of expression&quot; and &quot;artistic
merit&quot; as the main criteria for grants, ignoring the NEA's
charter legislation of 1965, which set &quot;encouragement of
excellence&quot; as the No. 1 criterion, followed by &quot;access
to the arts for all Americans&quot;;  
<P>
- Confusion in upper management about how to comply with congressionally-mandated
standards;
<P>
- Confusion about the NEA's primary mission;
<P>
- Conflicts of interest in the grant-awarding process;
<P>
- A bureaucracy openly hostile to public scrutiny;
<P>
- Bias against traditional forms of art and traditional values
in general.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>HOSTILITY TOWARD RELIGION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The First Amendment prohibits Congress (and federal agencies authorized
by Congress) to infringe on religious liberties.  It is clearly
unconstitutional to use federal tax dollars to create and distribute
an attack on religious beliefs.  The government has no business
dictating the value of religious beliefs or prescribing changes
in them. 
<P>
Yet the taxpayer-supported NEA over the years has funded works
that degrade or mock religious belief, particularly Christianity.
<P>
- In June, 1993, the Whitney Museum of American Art, which received
$200,000 from the NEA during 1992-1993, displayed <I>Abject Art:
Repulsion and Desire in American Art</I>.  The exhibit's journal
explains the focus: &quot;Although 'abject art' is a play on 'object
art,' the term does not connote an art movement so much as it
describes a body of work which incorporates or suggests abject
materials such as dirt, hair, excrement, dead animals, menstrual
blood, and rotting food in order to confront taboo issues of gender
and sexuality....  Employing methodologies adapted from feminism,
queer theory, post-structuralism, Marxism, and psychoanalysis,
our goal is to talk dirty in the institution [of art] and degrade
its atmosphere of purity and prudery by foregrounding issues of
gender and sexuality in the art exhibited.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Whitney show included works by Joel-Peter Witkin, who received
four fellowship grants from the NEA: Fiscal year 1980, $3,000;
FY 1981 $12,500; FY 1986, $15,000; FY 1992, $20,000.[12] Witkin's
work includes &quot;Maquette for Crucifix,&quot; a naked Jesus
Christ surrounded by sado-masochistic obscene imagery, and many
grotesque portrayals of corpses and body parts.  Another Whitney
exhibit was a film by Suzie Silver titled &quot;A Spy,&quot; which
depicts Jesus Christ as a woman standing naked with breasts exposed.
 The Whitney also included &quot;Piss Christ,&quot; Andres Serrano's
photograph of a crucifix in a jar of urine, and a film by porn
star Annie Sprinkle titled &quot;The Sluts and Goddesses Video
Workshop or How to be a Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps.&quot;[13] Sprinkle
has performed numerous times in NEA-funded venues such as Highways
in Los Angeles and The Kitchen Theater in New York, where she
has had audience members come on stage to examine her exposed
genitals.
<P>
- Diamanda Galas, who was The Kitchen Theater's first artist-in-residence,
performed &quot;Plague Mass&quot; at the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine in Manhattan in 1990, during which she appeared topless
and covered with blood.[14] A member of ACT-UP, the AIDS activist
group, she was arrested during a demonstration at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York in 1989.[15] On July 8, 1993, she opened the
Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center, which was supported by
a $14,700 dance grant from the NEA.[16] As the New York Times explains,
&quot;Conceptually, her work is close to that of the late David
Wojnarowicz, the visual artist-writer who died of AIDS in 1992.&quot;
 In 1990, the NEA gave a $15,000 grant to Wojnarowicz, who specialized
in photographs of men performing oral sex, anal sex, anal-oral
sex and masturbation.  An essay in one of his exhibits described
New York's John Cardinal O'Connor as &quot;a fat cannibal from
that house of walking swastikas up on fifth avenue,&quot; and
a &quot;creep in black skirts.&quot;[17]
<P>
- Anti-Christian material is distributed through the NEA-supported
Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.[18]
The following are a couple of the offerings, with descriptions
cited from &quot;Gay and Lesbian Tapes Distributed by the Video
Data Bank&quot;:
<P>
<I>Popular Thought</I>.  This video equates the &quot;moral majority&quot;
with totalitarianism.  &quot;UThe message reverberates with the
interweaving of archival footage of Nazi Youth, book burnings
and modern day Ohio Youth for Jesus creating an audiovisual fabric
of hatredU -- Carole Ann Klonarides.&quot;
<P>
<I>Peccatum Mutum (The Silent Sin)</I>.  &quot;...explores relationships
among cloistered nuns....  Utilizing gothic expressionistic sets,
humor, serious kissing, and melodrama, this work expresses the
contradictions and ironic similarities between physical desire
and spiritual fervor.  A rare glimpse at the other side of Catholic
guilt.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TARGETING THE FAMILY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Promotion of &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot; has long been
a staple of NEA grants.  A case in point is, again, NEA support
of the Video Data Bank, which offers these films and accompanying
synopses:[19]
<P>
- <I>Swamp</I>.  &quot;This subversive soap opera targets the
family, psychotherapy and property as the villains.&quot;
<P>
- <I>A Coalminer's Granddaughter</I>.  &quot;This hysterically
funny epic about a brutally realistic American family does for
lesbians what John Waters did for Baltimore....  Under the thumb
of her sleazy, evil father (brilliantly portrayed by novelist
Kevin Killian) Jane is not the hero of her own life....  <I>Coal
Miner's Granddaughter</I> opens up into the impressionistic world
of her sexuality...highly charged sexuality [that makes] staples
of lesbian erotica seem tepid and silly.&quot;
<P>
- <I>Talk to Me Like the Rain</I>.  &quot;...two brothers whose
incestuous behavior feeds a disillusionment in the trust and faith
with one another [sic].&quot;
<P>
- <I>Stephen</I>.  &quot;This production focuses on the story
of siblings and, in this case, twins locked in a complex, emotional
and sexual relationship....  In the end, the expectations of both
religion and a modern world are abandoned....&quot;
<P>
- <I>The A Ha! Experience</I>.  &quot;...explores the erotic elements
of mother-infant intimacy that are repeated in the oedipal devaluation
of the mother, the object of desire for the daughter.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>PROMOTING HOMOSEXUALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By validating the pro-homosexual viewpoint through taxpayer-supported
government grants, the NEA has helped legitimize pro-homosexual
theater in general.  <I>New York Newsday</I> arts critic Linda
Winer notes that: &quot;The fact is, much of the theater these
days is gay....  Indeed, much of it has been for a very long time....
 This season there have been so many gay projects that I've been
searching for an alternative to the term 'straight play' when
describing a nonmusical.&quot;[20]
<P>
NEA-funded venues such as The Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington,
D.C., The Franklin Furnace and The Kitchen in New York, Highways
in Los Angeles, and countless other NEA-funded theater groups
around the country present works promoting homosexuality and blasting
traditional morality.  The NEA also supports pro-homosexual projects
shown on the Public Broadcasting System.  Some recent examples
of pro-homosexual, NEA-supported works:
<P>
- In April, 1994, Woolly Mammoth staged NEA grant recipient Tim
Miller's one-man performance, &quot;My Queer Body,&quot; in which
he, among other things, describes what it's like to have sex with
another man, climbs naked into the lap of a spectator, and finally
arouses himself sexually in full view of the audience.[21]
<P>
- In January, 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service showed <I>Tales
of the City</I>, a three-part miniseries celebrating homosexual
life in San Francisco in the 1970s.  The series was full of gratuitous
nudity, crudity, lewdness and dozens of instances of foul language.
 Families are lampooned and homosexuality is portrayed as superior.
 The series was co-produced by American Playhouse, which received
$750,000 in NEA funds in 1993.  NEA received an on-screen credit
as a supporter of the film. 
<P>
- In August 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service aired <I>One
Nation Under God</I>, a misleading, one-sided documentary by two
homosexual activists that attempts to discredit ex-gay therapy
and counseling.[22] The NEA is credited as a main sponsor for the
film, which links Christian ministries to Nazi techniques such
as shock/aversion therapy, a practice which has long been denounced
by the ex-gay movement.  The film misportrays several homosexual
activists, misrepresents Evelyn Hooker's psychological studies
of homosexual men in the 1950's, and uses Biblical references
out of context.  The film also takes quotes from several therapists
and former homosexuals out of context.  In one clip, a former
homosexual explains that he used to think that &quot;God hates
homosexuals,&quot; but that he now knows that God loves them.
 The filmmakers include only the fragment, &quot;God hates homosexuals,&quot;
reversing the man's intended meaning.  Dr. Elizabeth Moberly,
author of <I>Psychogenesis</I> and founder of a Pennsylvania-based,
ex-gay ministry, says the filmmakers misrepresented themselves,
took her out of context in her taped interview and distorted severely
what she and other therapists had said.[23] The film was shown at
several gay and lesbian film festivals during the summer of 1994
and at the 1995 Gay Games and Cultural Festival in New York City.
 Over the years, the NEA has supported several gay and lesbian
film festivals, which have presented hard-core pornography and
anti-religious themes.[24]
<P>
- The NEA-supported Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago offers numerous homosexual films.  <I>Danny</I>, a
20-minute documentary, includes footage touting &quot; Uthe raw
sensuality of cruising and anonymous encountersU -- Robert Rosenberg,
Global Village.&quot;  <I>Jollies</I> is an 11-minute film by
Sadie Benning, who &quot;recounts her earliest sexual encounters.&quot;
 Another Benning work, <I>Me and Rubyfruit</I>, &quot;chronicles
the enchantment of teenage lesbian love.&quot;  Other titles in
the catalog are frankly pornographic.   
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TALKING POINTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Curbing the NEA would amount to censorship, and that's against
the First Amendment, isn't it?</B>
<P>
The First Amendment to the Constitution states that &quot;Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peacefully
to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;
<P>
The Constitution limits the federal government and, by extension
of the 14th Amendment, the states, from censoring protected speech,
as defined over the years by Supreme Court cases.  It does not
limit individual citizens nor private groups, which have freedom
to maintain their own standards of decency and their own viewpoints.
 The issue is one of sponsorship, not censorship.  There is no
constitutional &quot;right&quot; of an artist to a subsidy from
his fellow taxpayers.  
<P>
<B>But won't the arts collapse without federal aid?</B>
<P>
More than $9 billion in private giving sustains arts in communities
all over America.[25} The NEA's $175 million is important more for
its symbolism than for the actual dollars involved.   An NEA grant
validates an artist, and the government should not be in the business
of determining what is art.  That process smacks of &quot;official&quot;
art, such as is imposed on the artistic communities in totalitarian
societies.
<P>
<B>Can the NEA be reformed?</B>
<P>
No, it can't.  Congress has tried several times to rein in the
rogue agency, including appointing an independent commission to
study the NEA in 1990.  With some fanfare, the NEA adopted a few
reforms, but continued to fund the worst excesses in the art world.
 Even after Congress slightly cut the NEA's budget in 1994 as
a message of discontent, it continued to shovel money to artists
whose primary purpose is to insult the majority of taxpayers.
 Also, NEA officials consistently have displayed an arrogant disregard
for the taxpayers.  Even a pro-reform arts critic, the late Samuel
Lipman, who had been a member of the National Council on the Arts
during the 1980s, finally came to the conclusion in the 1990s
that the agency was irreparable and should be abolished.
<P>
<B>Besides ending subsidies for bad art, are there any other reasons
to defund NEA?</B>
<P>
Yes.  The federal deficit is out of control, so Congress must
find ways to cut back without endangering infrastructure.  Before
1965, the United States got along just fine without federal art
subsidies, which are a product of the Great Society's massive
government expansion.   Also, NEA funds are distributed in a grossly
distorted fashion, with certain areas such as New York, Los Angeles
and Minnesota receiving far more money than other states and cities.
 And many grants go to artists who are already successful and
do not need the money.  Finally, ending federal subsidies would
put a dent in cultural imperialism; pampered artists could no
longer use the federal government to tell the rest of the nation
what is art and what isn't.  Pulling the plug on NEA money would
mean that communities would support the arts that the people in
those communities wanted -- not the art that is dictated from
Washington, D.C.

<P>
Over the past decade, the federal government has spent billions
of dollars on HIV research, which has been geared predominantly
toward end-stage HIV (full-blown AIDS).  In Fiscal Year 1995,
the U.S. Public Health Service will spend $2.7 billion directly
on AIDS, the highest expenditure for any of the nation's 10 most
lethal diseases.[1]
<P>
AIDS ranks near the bottom of the list of the top 10 mortal diseases
and accounts for about 35,000 deaths annually.  Heart disease
claims 720,000 lives annually, and cancer kills 505,000.  Yet
the federal government will spend more on AIDS than on heart disease
($828 million) and cancer ($2.4 billion).[2]
<P>
The point is not that AIDS should cease receiving attention. 
HIV is a contagious disease and its victims deserve compassion
and help.  Funding should continue for treatment, prevention and
care.  However, AIDS funding must be brought into line with expenditures
for other life-threatening diseases, and the money must be redirected
toward more effective approaches.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>A CHANGING EPIDEMIC</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The scourge of AIDS, which began in America among white, male
homosexuals, has moved into poor, minority communities, driven
by prostitution, drug abuse and promiscuous sex.  Yet most AIDS
funding is still directed by, for and to the original target population.
<P>
AIDS funding generally is allocated according to the numbers of
people who ever have contracted AIDS -- including those who already
have died -- not those currently diagnosed with HIV.  This formula
has, for example, directed money to white, homosexual AIDS groups
in San Francisco while cities which now may have greater numbers
of HIV-infected patients get less financial aid.  The CDC has
reported that 55 percent of AIDS cases in 1993 came from minority
communities, with blacks having the worst rate of all the groups.[3]
Black women were approximately 15 times more likely than white
women to get AIDS, and black men were five times more likely to
get AIDS than white men.[4]
<P>
For many years, AIDS policy has been driven by the demands of
HIV-infected people who dominate AIDS organizations.  Their situations
are tragic, and their focus on finding a cure is understandable.
 But because of their considerable influence, the lion's share
of AIDS funding has been spent for treatment of end-stage HIV
(AIDS) and not on the full spectrum of HIV disease. 
<P>
Even the prevention efforts have been tailored toward protecting
the identities of those with HIV rather than toward measures that
have proven effective in stemming other serious epidemics.  Much
government time at AIDS conferences has been spent on perfecting
&quot;nonjudgmental&quot; vernacular, such as substituting &quot;people
living with HIV&quot; for the word &quot;victim&quot; or even
the word &quot;patient&quot; in order to reduce stigma.  In the
same vein, concern for confidentiality, while important, has been
overemphasized, and sound medical procedures have been thwarted
and often ignored.  The first step in stopping an epidemic is
identifying, on a confidential basis, those who have the disease.
 This process has been hampered by federally-funded AIDS activists,
who have defeated efforts to increase early diagnosis and confidential
partner notification, the surest ways to pinpoint the disease
and to help check its spread. 
<P>
Furthermore, the federal government's preventative response to
the epidemic has consisted largely of a million-dollar ad campaign
promoting condoms and hundreds of millions of dollars for AIDS
education that targets schoolchildren, acquainting them with graphic
materials explaining the various ways AIDS is transmitted, whether
they are at risk or not.  At the same time, populations that are
most at risk for HIV transmission are under-served, particularly
in black or Hispanic communities.
<P>
The current premise of many AIDS prevention efforts is that <I>uninfected</I>
persons have primary responsibility for stemming the epidemic,
not those already infected.  The focus must be changed to make
personal responsibility on the part of those infected the foundation
of future programs. 
<P>
The most successful AIDS eradication program in America has been
run by the U.S. armed forces.  Early diagnosis is the key.  Since
1985, every member of the military has been screened regularly
for HIV, resulting in a depth of knowledge about the disease that
is unparalleled.  Unlike civilian doctors, military medical personnel
are not &quot;flying blind&quot; in this epidemic and are getting
early treatment and notification to those affected.  There is
no &quot;AIDS epidemic&quot; in the military because aggressive
knowledge-based intervention prevents the spread of disease.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IDEAS FOR POLICY MAKERS</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Here are some proposals to overhaul federal AIDS programs, with
thanks to Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, a nonpartisan
Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group, for their
wise counsel on several of these points: 
<P>
<LI><B>Initiate prenatal HIV testing for all pregnant women</B>,
with an opt-out for those who want it.  Twenty-six percent of
HIV-infected mothers transmit the disease to their babies today
in the United States.  However, mothers who do not know they are
HIV-positive can unwittingly transmit it to the 74 percent of
uninfected babies by breast-feeding.  Furthermore, research shows
that when HIV-infected mothers are treated with the drug AZT,
the transmission rate drops from 26 percent to 8 percent.  Thus
knowledge of HIV status can save many lives.
<P>
<LI><B>Begin HIV partner notification programs in all 50 states,
the District of Columbia and U.S. territories</B>.  Partner tracing
is the fastest way to alert those in danger of infection and is
standard public health procedure for virtually all contagious
and sexually transmitted diseases.  Earlier this century, epidemics
of gonorrhea and syphilis were greatly reduced using this time-proven
procedure. 
<P>
<LI><B>Guarantee confidentiality to all who are tested.</B>  Concern
over misuse of HIV status has been the main obstacle to effective
testing programs.  But public health departments have reported
more than 400,000 cases of AIDS to the CDC without a single breach
of confidentiality in any of the 50 states.  Moreover, venereal
disease testing has been done for years without any serious breach-of-confidentiality problem. 
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul the Ryan White Act</B>, which dispenses about $650
million annually in federal funds.  The Ryan White Act is due
to expire in 1995.  Hearings need to be held to examine how the
money is being spent.  And the spending formulas should include
the following changes:
<P>
1) Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive
benefits.  Formulas based on &quot;AIDS prevalence&quot; distort
funding needs because they count the dead along with the living.
 Money ought to go where it is needed most, which is, increasingly,
to under-served minority communities.
<P>
2) People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they are currently
living, not where they were diagnosed.  Slating funds to areas
of diagnosis misses areas where AIDS patients are actually residing.
 For example, someone might be diagnosed with AIDS in a large
city, but return home to a suburban or rural area for care.
<P>
3) Means testing for AIDS care dollars should be introduced. 
Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with
those who truly have no other means of payment.
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul HIV/AIDS education</B>, which now emphasizes condoms
and has not been shown to be effective.  In fact, programs seeking
funding renewal should be required to show evidence that they
have reduced HIV transmission. 
<P>
Sex education should be geared toward abstinence education and
knowledge of HIV status.  True abstinence programs (not those
that merely mention abstinence and then focus on contraception)
are the only sex education programs that have been proven to alter
behavior in positive ways.  &quot;Comprehensive&quot; (contraceptive-based)
programs have been proven to have either no effect or to actually
encourage earlier or more frequent sexual experimentation.  The
key to stopping AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases is
not in the promotion of condoms but in the promotion of delayed
sexual activity and early knowledge of infection.  In a recent
test, three groups of people were monitored: 1) a group who received
HIV education, 2) a control group with no HIV education and 3)
a group who received HIV education, and who also underwent an
HIV test.  Only the latter group registered any behavioral change.
 Testing in and of itself heightens consciousness of the seriousness
of premature or promiscuous sex.
<P>
The federal AIDS education campaign has emphasized condoms first
and has treated abstinence as a largely unrealistic goal, even
though medical experts agree that it is the most medically sound
response.  Condoms are seen by some as a way of continuing high-risk
behavior regardless of HIV status.  But no honest medical professional
would recommend that an uninfected person have sex with an HIV-infected
partner using a condom for protection.  Condoms can reduce the
risk in a single encounter, but not to where it is anywhere near
acceptable to be considered in the context of &quot;prevention.&quot;
<P>
The CDC has even misrepresented the concept of abstinence, stating
in its literature that there is a &quot;26 percent failure rate
for periodic abstinence.&quot;[5] What they are really describing
is &quot;periodic sex.&quot;  There is no such thing as &quot;periodic
abstinence.&quot;  To understand the absurdity of this statement,
try imagining the police describing a burglar as having a 26 percent
&quot;periodic honesty&quot; failure rate.  Funding for all federal
AIDS programs that promote condom use and misrepresent abstinence
should be halted immediately.  Sex education programs under Title
X (a program that was a colossal, $3 billion failure over two
decades) should be zeroed out.
<P>
<LI><B>Focus research on the &quot;full spectrum&quot; of HIV</B>,
from inception on, instead of merely focusing on HIV's final stage
(AIDS).  Dr. Robert Redfield of Walter Reed Hospital notes that
finding a &quot;cure&quot; for this tricky retrovirus is only
a distant possibility (and still a worthy goal), but that early
detection is the key to prevention.[6] Also, research subject pools
need to include more women and people from minority communities,
where the epidemic is increasing at the fastest rates.
<P>
<LI><B>Change the formula for the Centers for Disease Control's
prevention planning committees.</B> They are currently biased
toward white, homosexual men, although the HIV epidemic has shifted
toward minority communities.  Testing authorization should not
be limited to licensed phlebotomists but expanded to include small,
trained groups that can operate within minority communities inexpensively
and efficiently, using the Orasure saliva-test collection device
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
<P>
<LI><B>Support distribution of the saliva-based HIV test</B>, approval
of which was held up for nearly four years by the FDA.  The test
is a reliable, inexpensive and convenient way to detect HIV. 
The sample is processed in a lab, so public health professionals
can track the epidemic when names are gained through confidential
testing.  Conversely, an<I> anonymous</I> home test backed by
AIDS activist groups would help &quot;drive the epidemic underground,&quot;
a concern voiced, ironically, by those same groups whenever the
testing issue is raised.  Anonymous home tests would discourage
people from being tested in a manner that fosters early counseling
and treatment and that could be tracked by public health professionals,
and it would severely limit the impact of partner-notification
programs that are under way in many states.  Furthermore, the
trauma of discovering that one has HIV infection, experienced
alone, could lead some to suicide. 
<P>
Although concerns of confidentiality are not to be taken lightly,
the idea of anonymous HIV testing is being driven by the notion
that the primary responsibility for the epidemic should fall on
those who are uninfected, not on those who have the virus.  
<P>
<LI><B>Require routine testing of patients and health care workers.
</B> Both parties should be notified of the results.  Ignorance
of infection has never aided the cause of good medical care. 
In many cases, women do not show early signs of HIV infection,
and the first indication comes when the patient is actually dying
of AIDS.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</CENTER></H3>
<P>
In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in
1991, Dr. Robert Redfield said, &quot;The chilling reality is
that the AIDS epidemic of the next decade has already occurred.
 Central to the military response was the recognition of HIV infection
for what it is -- a sexually transmitted, progressively fatal
infection, which, although not yet curable, is treatable and preventable.&quot;
<P>
The AIDS epidemic of the year 2000, indeed, has occurred already.
 In fact, it took place around 1990.  The HIV virus' incubation
period typically takes 10 years, so when public policy makers
are addressing full-blown AIDS in 1995, they are dealing with
behavior and causes that occurred in 1985.  While care of AIDS
patients and basic AIDS research is essential, prevention efforts
need to be targeted toward current patterns of behavior and the
current population groups most adversely affected.  Homosexual
white males still account for the largest number of AIDS cases,
but the growth in HIV infections increasingly is among poor, black
and Hispanic urban dwellers, including women.  It's time to gear
the federal AIDS effort toward sound, time-tested medical procedures
such as early diagnosis, reporting and confidential partner notification,
and it's time to make individual responsibility the touchstone
of public policy.

Authorization for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is due
to expire at the end of 1996.  But Congress must appropriate money
each year.  The new 104th Congress should decline to do so. 
<P>
There is no reason Congress should force the taxpayers to continue
subsidizing this outdated system, much of which (the best parts)
would survive nicely without federal aid.
<P>
The CPB, overseer of the Public Broadcasting Service and National
Public Radio, was created in 1967 to meet a perceived need for
taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial
networks.  That need, if there ever was one, has passed.  The
advent of cable television, satellite dishes and improved radio
technology has created an enormous menu of broadcasting choices
for consumers.  America has more than 11,700 radio stations and
more than 3,100 television licensees, plus 109 cable networks[1]
and another 6,963 translators and boosters, which extend the reach
of existing stations.[2] In addition, computer technology has created
a multitude of interactive computer highways, such as the Internet.
 It is not as if consumers don't have enough access to information.
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of $285.6 million annually.[3] This insults
the intelligence of the viewing/listening public, because it assumes
they won't appreciate or support good programming.  Yet the shows
that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be the very programs
that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame Street</I>,
<I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  
<P>
In a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require
taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars for art of any
kind.  And the CPB, like any government bureaucracy, has waste
built into it.  A Congressional Conference Report on the Public
Broadcasting Service discloses that &quot;a single individual
is paid $438,000 annually for his once a week 30 minute appearance.&quot;[4]
<P>
It also makes no sense when cable television and satellites are
providing hundreds of programming alternatives.  Anything that
is worth viewing on PBS, for instance, would be picked up by Bravo,
The Learning Channel, the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network and
other channels. 
<P>
Public broadcasting advocates acknowledge that major PBS and NPR
stations would continue to thrive without federal subsidies. 
Their concern, they say, is that smaller, rural stations would
be forced to close.  But rural radio listeners or TV viewers can
tune in to numerous commercial stations or even to National Public
Radio or Public Broadcasting Service stations in distant cities
merely by acquiring better equipment.  Would it really be a great
loss if rural folks were denied the ability to see <I>Tongues
Untied</I> on their own, local station? Living in the country
has its own rewards, but forcing other taxpayers to subsidize
money-losing operations and bad art should not be one of them.
<P>
Besides, there is no public clamor from rural people or suburbanites
or urban dwellers, for that matter, to continue to subsidize the
pet projects (and paychecks) of a small radical elite that is
at odds with most American values.  The case for CPB subsidies
is being made almost exclusively by those in &quot;the arts community&quot;
and radical political activists who stand to benefit directly
from taxpayer largesse.  A case in point is a recent letter from
Independent Television Service Executive Director James Yee to
public broadcasting advocates.  The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore,
in no way independent) ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new
programming for public broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent
colleagues&quot; to &quot;become involved in future efforts to
drum up support for public broadcasting, especially with your
local and national elected officials, local public broadcasting
station(s), media arts organizations, and civic and cultural institutions.&quot;[5]
Yee warned that &quot;an extensive informational outreach campaign
will have to be waged,&quot;[6] which means newspapers and broadcasters
will begin pelting their audiences with scary stories about the
demise of Big Bird, should budget cutters prevail.   
<P>
But the debate over CPB is not about grounding Big Bird.  Through
PBS and NPR, the CPB is peddling a political and social agenda
that is offensive to many.  For example, NPR reporter Sunni Khalid
revealed more than a bit of political bias when commenting on
the Republican Congressional victory during a C-Span <I>Journalists
Roundtable</I> (C-Span is not funded by CPB, but by America's
cable TV operators): &quot;I think there's a big difference when
people told Father Aristide to sort of moderate his views, they
were concerned about people being dragged through the streets,
killed and necklaced.  I don't think that is what [House Speaker]
Newt Gingrich has in mind.  I think he's looking at a more scientific,
a more civil way, of lynching people.&quot;[7]
<P>
The bright side is that few folks are tuning in to public broadcasting's
truly awful programs.   The bad side is that their money is being
used to produce shows that are used to validate attacks on them,
and then the same shows are foisted, in videocassettes, on unsuspecting
schoolchildren as &quot;educational&quot; supplements. 
<P>
Here are a few of the anti-family, anti-religious, pro-homosexual
offerings from public broadcasting in recent years:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-FAMILY PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In July 1994, a mother in Akron, Ohio, was shocked to find a
program titled <I>What if I'm Gay</I> sandwiched between <I>Kidsongs
TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I> from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. on her
local PBS station.  The mother's concern about placing such programming
at a time when many pre-school children and toddlers are watching
T.V. seems to have been largely ignored by the station.  After
the woman called the station to complain, the programming director
defended the show, saying, &quot;The quality of the program is
unquestionable.  It has good
writing and production and is well thought out.&quot;[8]
<P>
<LI>The Independent Television Service (ITVS) has been awarded more
than $38 million in public broadcasting funds since 1989.  For
that princely sum, according to public media watchdog <I>COMINT</I>
magazine, the public has received a mere nine hours of programming.
Perhaps this is a blessing, given ITVS's focus.  One five-hour
series called <I>Television Families,</I> for which ITVS (through
the taxpayers) ponied up $1.9 million, plans to feature &quot;tales
of more or less dysfunctional families&quot; which &quot;all fall
outside the mainstream.&quot; ITVS earlier had announced that
it is seeking programs that will &quot;test the boundaries, both
of form and content, that have defined the family's role on television.&quot;
 These include &quot;new alternative households, new patterns
for adoption and birth...new articulations of rights for children.&quot;
<P>
The anti-family agenda in this case is obvious.  It incorporates
and goes beyond <I>Murphy Brown's</I> glorification of single
motherhood.  The term &quot;alternative households&quot; is often
used to describe homosexual households and other non-traditional
households, putting them on the same moral plane as traditional
families.  &quot;New patterns for adoption and birth&quot; are
terms used to describe adoption of children by homosexuals and
artificial insemination.  &quot;Children's rights&quot; is the
anti-parent philosophy in which the state knows best when it comes
to handing out condoms, referring children to abortionists and
otherwise undermining the authority of parents. 
<P>
Another ITVS offering is <I>Dottie Gets Spanked</I>, a mockery
of 1950s American family life from the producer of the cult homosexual
films <I>Superstar</I> and <I>Poison</I>.  Yet another is <I>Terminal
USA</I>, described by the ITVS newsletter <I>Buzzwords</I> as
being about &quot;wholly unwholesome folks&quot; who &quot;cram
a lot of skeletons in their closet: drug abuse, homosexuality,
teen pregnancy, elderly abuse, unemployment, and infidelity (with
the pizza delivery boy) -- all under one roof.&quot; Making a
gratuitous slam on conservative Christians, <I>Buzzwords</I> concludes:
&quot;Unlike the absolute 'family values' of censorship-minded
evangelicals, <I>TV Families</I> values all kinds of families.&quot;[9]
<P>
<LI>In May of 1992 PBS broadcast a documentary called <I>What Kids
Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up</I>.  Produced by the Children's
Television Workshop, the show was an attack on traditional family
values in the guise of a pseudo-scientific presentation. 
<P>
The program contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children
as young as 8 years old.  Children are encouraged to use condoms
without being informed about high condom failure rates.  Abstinence
is given only a passing mention.  Parents are nearly invisible,
as are clergy or any other adults who would normally articulate
moral and familial ramifications of sexuality. 
<P>
Having a baby is illustrated through an exercise in which teens
carry around a bag of flour for a week and then talk about how
it cramps their style.  This exercise fails to take into account
the joys of parenthood.  It dehumanizes babies and subordinates
life itself to the cold sexual imperative. 
<P>
None of the instructors use the word &quot;marriage&quot; in any
context.  Sex is portrayed strictly as a physical act, without
the larger moral and social contexts that constitute the real
&quot;facts of life.&quot;  &quot;Husbands&quot; and &quot;wives&quot;
are not mentioned, just &quot;partners.&quot; This video is now
available in commercial video stores.
<P>
<LI>Children's Television Workshop also publishes <I>Sesame Street
Parents</I> magazine, which features an advice column by New York
University psychologist Lawrence Balter.   In the January/February
1994 issue, Dr. Balter advises parents that masturbation is a
&quot;tension-relieving activity that, much like hair twirling
and thumb-sucking, serves to soothe and calm children.  Masturbation
can also help a child learn more about his body and help him develop
positive attitudes toward sex....Avoid telling your son that touching
himself is 'not nice.'&quot;[10]
<P>
<LI>In 1992, the POV (Point of View) series began with <I>Color
Adjustment</I>, a documentary by homosexual writer and AIDS victim,
the late Marlon Riggs (see <I>Tongues Untied</I> item below),
who complained about the heterosexual bias of most family programming:
&quot;Have we exchanged the myths of pre-television America for
new fictions just as confining, for impossibly rigid, homogenized
fictions of the family, and the American dream....?&quot;[11]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PRO-HOMOSEXUAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On January 5, 1995, National Public Radio's &quot;All Things
Considered&quot; ran what amounted to a promotion of homosexual
punk rock music, focusing on the new activist group Homocore.
 NPR reporter Rick Carr describes New York's Pansy Division as
&quot;one of hundreds of bands that infuse punk rock's do-it-yourself
aesthetic with gay themes.&quot;[12] 
<P>
<LI>In early 1994, PBS ran the miniseries <I>Tales of the City</I>,
a celebration of homosexuality in San Francisco during the 1970s.
 The series presents the homosexual lifestyle as superior to marriage
and family, with few apparent consequences from promiscuous sex
or illicit drugs.  The series is full of gratuitous nudity, crudity,
lewdness and foul language.  Traditional families are lampooned
through stereotypical caricatures of stupid fathers and meddling
mothers.  The only person dying from an incurable disease is a
heterosexual businessman who winds up cheating on his wife with
a transsexual.  Even an edited version of the series that ran
on Oklahoma public television caused a &quot;quite a bit of animosity
amongst a considerable number of legislators from rural areas,&quot;
Bob Allen of Oklahoma ETV told <I>Current</I>, a public broadcasting
trade journal.[13] The publication noted that <I>Tales</I> had also
drawn acclaim from critics and &quot;just about everywhere, local
outlets heard both praise and disapproval from viewers.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>In 1991, PBS aired a film documentary titled <I>Tongues Untied</I>.
 Written by ITVS grant recipient Marlon Riggs and shown under
the banner of POV, the documentary was so offensive that more
than 100 PBS stations refused to air it.  Still, many urban stations
did air the show, which contained full frontal nudity, bare buttocks
and 20 seconds of two men disrobing and having sex.
<P>
<LI>In June of 1992, PBS aired <I>The Lost Language of Cranes</I>
as part of Gay Pride Month.  The film features a father and son
&quot;coming out,&quot;  to declare their homosexuality.  The
movie also shows a man attempting to initiate anonymous sex with
a man in a homosexual porn theater.  Graphic scenes of homosexuals
kissing and engaging in sex are also featured.
<P>
Homosexual activists have acknowledged CPB's contribution to their
cause.  At a public hearing on CPB held in Washington, D.C. in
January 1994, Cathy Renna of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation (GLAAD) congratulated CPB, which, she said, &quot;has
aired many documentaries, films, and series that have touched
on or dealt with gay issues.&quot; She urged CPB to &quot;continue
to bring as much gay-oriented programming as possible to the viewing
public without fear of reprisal or complaint.&quot;[15] At the same
hearing, Gregory King of the Human Rights Campaign Fund noted,
&quot;...the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, through your
support of National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service,
has had an important impact on the ability of lesbian and gay
Americans to emerge from the shadows of society into the sunlight
of American life.&quot;[16] He singled out NPR's <I>Morning Edition</I>,
<I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I> and the <I>Charlie Rose Show</I>,
which &quot;regularly include discussions with gay and lesbian
Americans on issues of public importance,&quot; and praised CPB
for its support of gay-themed programming, such as <I>In the Life</I>,
<I>The American Playhouse</I>, <I>Longtime Companion</I>, <I>Andre's
Mother</I>, <I>The AIDS Quarterly</I>, <I>The Lost Language of
Cranes</I>, <I>Silverlake Life: The View from Here</I> and Armistead
Maupin's <I>Tales of the City</I> for bringing &quot;gay and lesbian
concerns into the mainstream of American life, where they belong.&quot;[17]
<P>
What King failed to add is that these aforementioned programs
are loaded with homosexual activists' propaganda and ignore the
health consequences of homosexual behavior.  They also ignore
the existence of the burgeoning ex-gay movement, reserving that
topic for the smear show, <I>One Nation Under God</I>.  PBS' pro-homosexual
programs also typically screen out any knowledgeable opponents
of the gay rights movement. 
<P>
In closing, King urged CPB to &quot;continue to provide leadership
in using the airwaves...to break the bonds of bigotry.&quot;[18]
<P>
Speaking of bigotry, public broadcasting harbors the last respectable
form of bigotry in America: Christian bashing.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On September 6, 1993, National Public Radio's <I>All Things
Considered</I> chronicled a controversy in Colorado Springs. 
The story was about some parents who objected to their children
being baptized without their parents' knowledge during a local
church carnival.[19] The controversy was real, and the conflict compelling.
 However NPR's handling of the story was anything but evenhanded.
<P>
Opening remarks by the reporter implied that children are no longer
safe in Colorado Springs because of the presence of Christian
groups.  No spokesmen are included to combat the anonymous charge
that Colorado Springs is fraught with &quot;religious extremism.&quot;
 The story presented an organization named The Citizen's Project
as a &quot;liberal volunteer&quot; organization that promotes
communication and understanding between its members and conservative
Christians.  However, on another program aired on NPR, which was
also openly biased against Christians, the Citizen's Project is
described as a &quot;watchdog&quot; organization that gives citizens
a sense of belonging by &quot;organizing opposition to [the Christian]
agenda.&quot;
<P>
<LI>In October of 1993, NPR broadcast a documentary titled <I>The
Politics of Bigotry</I>.  Described as an &quot;in-depth investigation
of the Christian Right...,&quot; the show was actually an ugly
smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment protection
against infringement on the free exercise of religion.  
<P>
The two-and-a-half hour documentary contains many opinions presented
as if they were fact and gives Christians no opportunity to respond
to the majority of statements made by their detractors.
<P>
<LI>A segment of PBS's <I>Bill Moyers' Journal</I> titled <I>The
New Holy War</I>[20] was supposed to be a documentary about Colorado's
&quot;Amendment Two,&quot; a statewide ballot initiative which
would have prohibited political jurisdictions across the state
from granting special rights to homosexuals.  Instead it was an
anti-religious hit piece disguised as balanced journalism.  The
issue is framed in terms of a struggle between homosexuals, who
Moyers portrays as oppressed victims fighting for their rights,
and Evangelical Christians, who are pictured as intolerant bigots.
<P>
Moyers works hard to pass himself off as an objective journalist.
 However, he reveals his bias when he conducts an in-depth critical
look at an organization supporting Amendment Two without so much
as mentioning any one of the several organizations fighting against
it.  Also, Moyers fails to inform viewers of vote totals, the
percentage of evangelical Christians in the state, or that many
non-evangelicals supported Amendment Two.  Moyers charges, but
fails to present any evidence, that the conflict was strictly
between homosexuals and Christians.[21]
<P>
Moyers' greatest omission was his failure to present an accurate
portrayal of the homosexual lifestyle.  The show features male
and female homosexual couples who are clean cut, monogamous and
well-spoken.  While this image may be true of the couples featured
on the show, it is in sharp contrast with what the research tells
us about the homosexual lifestyle.  Research shows that male homosexuals
typically are quite promiscuous, with many sexual partners over
the course of a lifetime.  In addition, homosexuals are at high
risk for a host of sexually transmitted diseases and violence
within relationships.  Homosexual males typically and tragically
have shorter lifespans.[22]  Homosexuals are also more likely to have
drug and alcohol abuse problems.[23]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>RADICAL POLITICAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Ultra-left <I>Pacifica</I> radio, along with PBS's <I>Frontline</I>,
<I>Point of View</I> and dozens of PBS specials, have been criticized
for left-wing bias.  Some recent examples:
<P>
<UL><LI> In 1992, KPFK, the <I>Pacifica</I> station in Los Angeles, broadcast
an <I>African Mental Liberation Weekend</I>.  The 26-hour marathon
of speeches and interviews was called a &quot;hatefeast&quot;
by members of the L.A. Jewish community.[24] Speakers included Louis
Farrakhan, who said that whites and Jews were &quot;the pale horse
with death its rider and hell close behind.&quot;[25] The broadcast
also featured black supremacist Leonard Jeffries lecturing on
Jewish involvement in the slave trade and Steve Cokely, who evoked
a &quot;Jew doctors conspiracy to infect black children with AIDS.&quot;[26]
<P>
<LI>In May 1994, NPR announced plans to run prison-life commentaries
by convicted cop-killer and former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal,
claiming that the show would bring a &quot;unique perspective
to listeners.&quot;[27] Although the show was canceled after Sen.
Robert Dole took to the Senate floor to decry CPB's lack of balance,
the incident raised serious questions about CPB's judgment and
commitment to balanced programming. 
<P>
<LI>Several specials have been broadcast which support totalitarian
and anti-American causes.  For example: <I>Maria's Story</I>,
a show about the war in El Salvador from the communist FMLN's
perspective and <I>Cuba in the Shadow of Doubt</I>, which was
described by a <I>New York Times</I> critic as having &quot;...a
romantic infatuation with Cuba.&quot;[28] Another example is a PBS
documentary on families divided over the Castro regime entitled
<I>Miami-Havana</I>.  The credits of the film contain a &quot;special
thanks&quot; to the Combinado del Este prison.  According to Alberto
Mora, a Cuban-American lawyer, &quot;no prison has a grislier
reputation than Combinado del Este.  Mind you, this notoriety
stands out even in the context of a prison system infamous for
its barbarism.&quot;[29]
<P></UL>
<CENTER><H3>NO NEED FOR SUBSIDIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In a truly free broadcasting market, programs of very limited
appeal would most likely not garner advertising support.  They
would be confined to media that are supported by those who seek
this information.  Left-leaning foundations and individual donors
might be persuaded to fund them, but they have little incentive
to do so while it is so easy to tap the taxpayers.
<P>
The programs mentioned above are not the examples that CPB supporters
cite when they complain that good programming would be lost without
CPB.  Instead, CPB advocates point to popular shows such as <I>Sesame
Street</I> and <I>The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour</I>.  They fail
to mention that the popular shows will fare well in free market
competition.  Children's Television Workshop, parent company of
<I>Sesame Street</I>, has a stock and bond portfolio worth more
than $51 million.[30] And gross merchandising sales of Sesame Street
items rack up $1 billion annually, earning CTW about $100 million
in royalties.[31] One divisional CTW president had an annual salary,
including bonuses, of $625,000.[32] 
<P>
CPB funding makes up only 14 percent of public broadcasting's
total budget.[33] Federal grants from other agencies, such as the
National Endowment for the Arts, make up another 5 percent.  The
rest comes from donors, businesses, foundations, state governments,
public colleges and universities, auction participants and private
colleges and universities.  All told, 49 percent of public broadcasting's
budget comes from taxpayers at all levels, but the direct federal
component makes up only 19 percent.[34]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Pulling CPB's tax-funded plug would force producers to take into
account the tastes of their audiences and would motivate public
broadcasters to look to their lucrative offspring, like Barney
or Bill Moyers, to contribute more to the collective coffers.
 The result? Good programming would continue to thrive, and the
offensive and meritless programs would likely go the way of that
other big bird, the dodo.  
<P>
It's time to zero-budget the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
 Big Bird should leave the nest of Big Government and fly on his
own.

<H2>SUFFER THE CHILDREN:<BR>
TITLE X's FAMILY PLANNING FAILURE</H2>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<I>by </I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
Title X of the Public Health Service Act is a categorical grant
issued by the federal government to fund family planning projects
throughout the United States.  Enacted in 1970, Title X was supposed
to help reduce the unplanned pregnancy rate, especially in the
teenager population.  However, Title X has not only failed to
reduce the teenage pregnancy rate, but teenage reproductive health
has drastically worsened in every category.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X'S IMPACT ON TEENAGE HEALTH</H3></CENTER> 
<P>
Over the lifetime of Title X, the number of teenage clients has
grown due to increases in both Title X funding and the overall
number of enrollees in Title X clinics.  Currently, an estimated
1.5 million Title X clients are teenagers, constituting approximately
one-third of the program's total clientele.  But even though more
teenagers are being exposed to these family planning &quot;services,&quot;
the rates of out-of-wedlock births, abortions, sexually-transmitted
diseases, and pregnancies have all risen significantly in the
teenage population since the program's inception.
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births -- <I>Since the introduction
of Title X, the teenage out-of-wedlock birth rate has doubled.</B></I>
 The out-of-wedlock birth rate per 1,000 unmarried girls aged
15-19 rose from 22.4 in 1970 to 44.6 in 1992 (teen births have
declined since 1992).
<P>
This illegitimacy figure is especially important to note because
Title X advocates have sought to claim &quot;success&quot; by
pointing out that the overall teenage birth rate has declined.
 However, such a decline is only attributable to the decline in
<I>marital</I> births, <I>not</I> in illegitimate births.  In
1970, seventy percent of teenage births were marital; in 1991,
7 in 10 teenage births occurred <I>outside</I> marriage.
<P>
The same trend toward out-of-wedlock childbearing is evidenced
in the female population at large.  In 1970 when Title X began,
children living with one parent were more than four times as likely
to be products of divorce as they were to have been born out-of-wedlock.
 But by 1993, the Census Bureau reports found that American children
who live with one parent were almost equally divided between children
of divorce and those born to unmarried parents.
<P>
<LI><B>Abortions -- <I>Over the lifetime of Title X, the
teenage abortion rate has more than doubled.</B></I>  In 1972,
the abortion rate per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 was 19.1; in 1990,
the rate was 40.6.  While the abortion rate grew rapidly from
1972 to the early 1980s, the rate has apparently reached a plateau,
hovering between 40 and 43 abortions per 1,000 teenage girls over
the last 10 years.
<P>
While the rapid growth of the teenage abortion rate during the
early years of Title X is no doubt attributable, in large measure,
to the <I>Roe v. Wade</I> decision, the past decade's more stabilized
abortion rate cannot be viewed optimistically.  For during this
time, a rapid rise also occurred in out-of-wedlock births.
<P>
Interestingly, the women whom Title X clinics target -- low-income
women, minorities, and unmarried young people -- have the highest
abortion rates.  And, the Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that
half of all women having an abortion used a contraceptive method
in the month during which they conceived.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs) -- <I>Sexually-transmitted
diseases among teenagers have increased dramatically despite the
fact that many Title X clinics provide both contraception and
STD screening.  In fact, teenagers now have higher rates of gonorrhea
than any other 5-year age group between 20 and 44.</B></I>  Currently,
one in four sexually experienced teenagers -- about 3 million
-- become infected with an STD every year.
<P>
For the first time ever, teenage girls have the highest gonorrhea
rates in the nation; teenage boys rank second.  The rate in adolescent
girls is 20 times higher than in women over 30, according to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Infectious
syphilis rates more than doubled among teenagers since the mid-1980s.
 Additionally, up to 15 percent of sexually experienced teenage
girls are infected with human papilloma virus, many of them carrying
a strain that can cause cervical cancer.  Chlamydia also has spread
explosively, currently infecting 22 percent of sexually active
girls and 10 percent of sexually active boys.  Finally, one in
five reported full-blown AIDS cases is diagnosed among people
in their 20s.  Due to the virus' long incubation period (about
10 years), most were adolescents when they were infected, according
to the CDC.
<P>
Sexually-transmitted diseases can lead to cancer, pelvic inflammatory
disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and/or even death.  Estimates
from the general population indicate that between 100,000 and
150,000 women become infertile each year as a result of an STD,
and about 15 to 30 percent of the 2.3 million U.S. couples who
are infertile may be unable to conceive as a result of an STD.
 But beyond infertility, STDs also increase the likelihood of
contracting HIV.  According to some estimates, having an STD,
such as gonorrhea, increases by as much as 100 times the chance
of contracting HIV from an infected partner.
<P>
<LI><B>Pregnancies -- <I>Since the introduction of Title
X, the out-of-wedlock pregnancy rate among 15-to 19-year-old girls
has doubled.</B></I>  In the same time span, the <I>overall</I>
teenage pregnancy rate (marital and nonmarital) increased 23 percent,
climbing from 95.1 per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in 1972 to 117.1
in 1990.  So not only did the overall teenage pregnancy rate increase,
but a greater proportion of these pregnancies are now out-of-wedlock.
 This trend is best evidenced by the growing rate of out-of-wedlock
births.  When Title X began, only 3 in 10 teen births were out-of-wedlock;
now 7 in 10 teen births occur outside marriage.
<P>
Despite the 23 percent increase in the overall teen pregnancy
rate, Title X advocates still claim &quot;success&quot; by stating
that &quot;fewer sexually experienced teenagers become pregnant
each year.&quot;  Advocates often remark that the pregnancy rate
among sexually experienced teenagers has decreased from 254 to
207 per 1,000 (19%) in the last two decades.  However, this figure
is derived from a statistical invention called the &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; (SETPR) which obscures
the disastrous changes in teenage sexual activity and ignores
the real indices of social health, i.e., the rates of teenage
pregnancy, abortion, out-of-wedlock births, and STDs.  The fact
is, a greater proportion of teenagers are sexually experienced
today than 20 years ago.
<P>
Consider the following hypothetical comparison of two nations,
Country A and Country B:
<p><pre><center>
<B>Country    # of teenage     # sexually     # pregnant    SETPR
          girls 15-19      active         annually           </B>
<P>
  A        1,000,000        500,000       200,000       400
  B        1,000,000        100,000       50,000        500
</center></pre><p>
In this straightforward example, Country B has a 25% higher &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; than Country A.  But
Country B has only one-fifth the sexual activity rate of Country
A and one-fourth of its teenage pregnancy rate.  In fact, it is
obvious that Country A can have a lower SETPR than Country B while
still having a higher sexual activity rate, a higher rate of STDs,
a higher number of pregnancies, and both four times as many abortions
and out-of-wedlock births as Country B!  SETPR may be of some
statistical interest at the margin, but as a measure of adolescent
well-being it is not merely useless, but grossly misleading.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X FUNDING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By all accounts, teenage reproductive health has suffered under
Title X's watch.  Yet, incredibly, Title X programs continue to
receive <I>increased</I> government funding, currently reaching
an all-time high of $193 million for fiscal year 1995.  Why? 
Because there is <I>no</I> <I>accountability</I> or measure of
effectiveness connected to the funding of the program.  There
has never been an evaluation component included in the grants;
and in 1983, the Department of Health and Human Services discontinued
collecting client data.
<P>
The federal government is not only funding a failed program, it
is funding an <I>unauthorized</I> program.  Title X's funding
authorization officially expired in 1985, but the program continues
to receive federal dollars every year through inclusion in the
Labor/Health and Human Services Appropriations bill.
<P>
<B>PROHIBITION OF ABORTION</B> -- Section 1008 of Title X states
that &quot;none of the funds appropriated under this title shall
be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.&quot;
 Yet many of the clinics which receive Title X funds perform abortions
in addition to providing other family planning services.  These
clinics creatively &quot;obey&quot; the prohibition by maintaining
separate budgets for abortion and family planning.  However, when
self-titled &quot;family planning&quot; clinics perform abortions
and refer clients for abortion when contraception fails, an implicit
assumption exists that abortion is indeed a method of family planning.
 Additionally, many Planned Parenthood (PP) clinics receive Title
X funds.  And while not all of these PP clinics perform abortions,
Planned Parenthood's reputation as an abortion provider is undisputable.
 Thus, to the client, no relevant distinction is made between
abortion and family planning; in fact, the prohibition has been
reduced to a mere bookkeeping formality.  Such a misuse of the
statute must be immediately halted and the integrity of the prohibition's
original intent restored.
<P>
<CENTER> <H3>TEENAGE SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND CONTRACEPTIVE USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Poor teenage reproductive health outcomes and Title X funding
are clearly correlated.  But the question that begs to be answered
is, &quot;What accounts for the correlation?  What effect do contraceptive
counseling and dispensing have on teenagers' sexual behavior?&quot;
 While such questions cannot be answered easily, there are clues
which point in a common direction.
<UL><P>
<LI>Sexual activity rates among teenagers are higher now than ever
before.  Currently, fifty-six percent of girls and 73 percent
of boys have intercourse before age 18, compared to 35 percent
and 55 percent in the early 1970s.
<P>
<LI>A 1993 <I>Public Health Reports</I> article found that adolescent
males who had been instructed in sexual biology and birth control
were at a higher risk of early first intercourse than were those
who had received no instruction.
<P>
<LI>Research from Planned Parenthood shows that the number one reason,
by far, that teenagers initiate sexual activity is peer pressure.
 By promoting contraceptive use among teenagers, Title X clinics
reduce the number of outside forces bolstering teenagers' resolve
to save sex for marriage.
</UL><P>
<B>MULTIPLE PARTNERS</B> -- According to the Centers for Disease
Control, &quot;The initiation of sexual intercourse early in life
is associated with an increased number of sex partners and a greater
risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).&quot;  Data show
that one-half of sexually experienced teenage girls wait almost
18 months between first intercourse and having sex with a second
sexual partner; another one-fourth wait almost 2 years.  Thus,
helping teenagers to delay sex initiation is especially important.
<P>
However, evidence also indicates that <I>contraceptive use leads
to increased sexual activity, with a greater number of partners.</I>
 Consequently, the dispensing of prescription contraceptives without
parental involvement by family planning clinics would serve to
exacerbate this trend -- which is, in fact, what is happening
today.
<UL><P>
<LI>Among sexually active girls aged 15-17, 55 percent have had
2 or more partners and 13 percent have had at least 6.
<P>
<LI>Between 1971 and 1988, the percentage of sexually experienced
women aged 15-19 living in urban areas who reported 4 or more
sex partners increased from 14% to 31%.
<P>
<LI>Forty-five percent of 15-24-year-olds who had initiated sexual
intercourse before age 18 reported having had four or more partners;
75 percent reported having had two or more partners.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Robert Kistner of Harvard Medical School, one of the developers
of the oral contraceptive, subsequently acknowledged that use
of contraceptives among teenagers is stimulating higher levels
of promiscuity:  &quot;About ten years ago I declared that the
pill would not lead to promiscuity.  Well, I was wrong,&quot;
he said (<I>Family Practice News</I>, 1977).
</UL><P>
<B>CONTRACEPTIVE FAILURE</B> -- Not only does contraceptive use
lead to increased sexual activity with a greater number of partners,
but contraception is not terribly effective at protecting teenagers
from unplanned pregnancy and/or STD infection.  Indeed, one-third
of teenage pregnancies occur <I>while a contraceptive is being
used</I>, and this figure does not even take into account the
STD transmission rate.
<P>
In part, this is due to the fact that no contraceptive method
is highly effective in protecting simultaneously against pregnancy
and infection.  Contraceptives with the best record for reducing
pregnancy risk offer little, if any, protection against STDs.
 On the other hand, condoms have a standardized failure rate of
15.7 percent at preventing <I>pregnancy</I> over the course of
a year; in teenagers, the rate is even higher.  In addition to
a poor contraceptive record, condoms have not been shown to be
effective at protecting women against STD infection.  A recent
<I>Family Planning Perspectives</I> article found that condoms
may protect women against some STDs, but the data are equivocal.
 In several studies, condoms showed no protective effect against
cervical human papilloma virus, chlamydia, or bacterial vaginosis
in women.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Maternal and infant mortality might not seem, at first glance,
to be related to a discussion of Title X's impact on teenagers;
but, in reality, the two concepts are inextricably connected.
 Title X's mandate is to reduce maternal and infant mortality
and to promote the health of mothers and children.  However, Title
X has miserably failed in fulfilling this mandate.  America ranks
24th in the world in infant survival, a very low ranking for a
developed country, let alone the wealthiest country in the world.
 And the problems associated with Title X -- out-of-wedlock births,
teenage pregnancies, and STDs -- are major factors undermining
maternal and infant health.
<UL><P>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births</B> -- Nicholas Eberstadt and others
have shown that marital status at birth is the key indicator for
infant mortality, transcending both ethnicity and poverty.  And
the out-of-wedlock teenage birth rate has soared under Title X's
watch.
<P>
<LI><B>Teenage pregnancy</B> -- One major cause of infant mortality
is low birth weight, which is directly related to teenage pregnancy.
 Thus it comes as no surprise that Title X's failure to reduce
teenage pregnancy would also result in higher infant mortality.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-transmitted diseases</B> -- As was discussed earlier,
STDs have a negative impact on women's health, possibly leading
to cancer, infertility, and even death.  Ectopic pregnancies,
which can be caused by STDs, have quadrupled since 1970, and the
rate of infertility among women has also dramatically increased.
 But in addition to women, STDs hurt infants.  The infection of
infants from the mother's STDs (including, but not limited to
HIV) has become a significant problem and will only continue to
worsen as nonmarital sexual activity remains unchecked.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>FRC RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING TITLE X</CENTER></H3>
<P>
<B>(1)</B>  <B>Remove all funding from Title X</B> -- Title X
has not only failed to reduce the rates of teenage pregnancy,
out-of-wedlock births, and sexually-transmitted diseases, it has
exacerbated these problems.  The program's lack of evaluation
criteria and its approach as an open-ended project grant have
frustrated accountability.
<P>
Title X does not deserve to continue receiving taxpayer dollars
and, in fact, <I>should</I> not be receiving federal dollars,
as an unauthorized program.  The federal government has a responsibility
to use federal funds wisely, and it should not be funding programs
which, by all accounts, have produced worsened health outcomes.
<P>
<B>(2)</B>  <B>If Title X comes up for reauthorization, do not
reauthorize</B> -- Title X's authorization expired in 1985.  And
Title X should remain unauthorized because it has never been shown
to benefit the American public.
<P>
<B>(3)</B>  <B>Promote saving sex for the context of marriage</B>
-- If the federal government must play a role in &quot;family
planning,&quot; it ought to promote the optimum health message
-- that sex should be saved for marriage.  Research shows that
people who postpone sexual activity until marriage and practice
monogamy within marriage are more likely to be sexually satisfied,
to have enduring marriages, and to be free from the ravages of
out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases.

<P>
Adoption is a good choice and sound policy.  And now it is finally
receiving some well-deserved attention by Congress.  Under consideration
are two laudable reform proposals which would make it easier for
more people to choose adoption.
<P>
(1) <B>Reducing financial obstacles</B> -- The House GOP's Contract
with America includes the Family Reinforcement Act, of which adoption
assistance is a primary component.  This proposal would make adoption
a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing
a tax credit of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.
 These expenses could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney
fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal
adoption of the child.  Appropriately, the legislation explicitly
excludes payments to surrogate mothers and to individuals adopting
their spouse's children.
<P>
(2) <B>Reducing legal (and psychological) barriers -- </B>As
a proposed amendment to the welfare reform bill, the National
Council for Adoption has suggested that unmarried mothers who
place their babies for adoption should be exempted from provisions
which require welfare recipients to identify the father of the
child as a condition of receiving assistance.  The proposal recognizes
paternal rights by giving fathers a period of up to thirty days
after the child's birth to come forward and claim custody of the
child.  Should the father fail to do so, his rights would be terminated,
and the child would be eligible for adoption.  This proposal should
be reviewed as a possible alternative to single parenthood that
increases the incentive for unwed mothers to choose adoption.
<P>
These proposals are laudable because they encourage adoption --
a beneficial option for the birthmother, the adopted child, and
the adoptive parents.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE CHILD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption holds many benefits for the child involved.  Recently,
the Search Institute conducted the largest U.S. study of adopted
adolescents and their families to evaluate the mental health of
these adolescents at a time when they are forming their identities.
 This study, combined with other research, found that adopted
adolescents reap the following benefits:
<P>
<UL><LI><B>A Loving, Intact Family</B> -- Ninety percent of adopted
children live with married parents, and these families exhibit
high levels of warmth, communication, discipline, and cohesion.
 Indeed, the Search Institute's representative sample found that
only 11 percent of adopted adolescents report divorce or separation
compared to 28 percent in a national survey of adolescents.
<P>
<LI><B>Deep Child-Parent Attachment</B> -- Adopted adolescents
are as deeply attached to their parents as are their non-adopted
siblings.  Fifty-four percent report strong attachment to both
parents; another 30 percent are deeply attached to one parent.
 Equally compelling is the fact that 95 percent of parents experience
strong attachment to their adopted child.
<P>
<LI><B>Strong Self-Identity</B> -- Most adopted adolescents have
a strong self-identity, exhibiting higher levels of self-esteem
than their peers.  They accept their adoptive status with relative
ease and are as likely to report a positive self-identity as their
non-adopted siblings.
<P>
<LI><B>Positive Psychological Health</B> -- Based on multiple
indices of psychological health, the study found that at least
three-quarters of adopted adolescents are within the zone of positive
psychological health, even surpassing a comparison sample of public
school adolescents on several measures.
<P>
<LI><B>Financial Provision</B> -- Fifty-four percent of adopted
children live in homes with family income three times higher than
poverty level.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE SINGLE MOTHER</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Research shows that young, unmarried women who choose adoption
for their babies reap many personal benefits.  Comparing favorably
to their counterparts, who choose single parenthood, women who
choose adoption exhibit the following characteristics.  They are:
<P>
<UL><LI>More likely to complete high school and advance further educationally.
<LI>More likely to be employed and have a higher income.
<LI>Less likely to live in poverty.
<LI>Less likely to receive public assistance than birth mothers
who chose to parent out-of-wedlock.  In fact, 60 percent of welfare
recipients are, or were at one time, teenage mothers.
<LI>More likely to marry subsequently.
<LI><B>Less likely to have a repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy</B>
than the teenagers who choose parenting or abortion.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION POLICY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption provides children with the benefits of solid, two-parent
homes while giving birthmothers the opportunity to mature before
taking on the adult responsibilities of childrearing.  That policy
should encourage adoption as a positive alternative for women
facing crisis pregnancies seems especially prudent during this
time when our nation's rates of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion,
and single parenthood are skyrocketing.
<P>
<UL><LI><B>Illegitimacy</B> -- Births to unmarried teenagers continue
to escalate dramatically.  In 1992, there were 365,000 out-of-wedlock
teenage births -- a six-fold increase since 1950.  But even in
the population at large (not limited to teenagers), illegitimacy
is rampant.  Thirty percent of all our nation's children were
born to unwed mothers in 1991; in the black community, the figure
was an astounding 68 percent.
<P>
<LI><B>Single Parenthood</B> -- The number of children being raised
in single-parent homes is rapidly rising.  In 1970, 7.5 million
children lived in single, female-headed homes; by 1993, the figure
had more than doubled to 15.6 million.  In fact, over 27 percent
of all children under 18 live in single-parent homes (1993).
<P>
<LI><B>Abortion</B> -- Abortion is strongly linked to unwed pregnancy.
 Indeed, unmarried mothers account for 70 to 80 percent of the
1.5 million abortions performed on U.S. women; 406,000 abortions
were obtained by teenagers in 1992.  Thus, helping to make adoption
a more viable option could mean (1) fewer abortions, including
repeat abortions, and (2) many women being spared from experiencing
the trauma of post-abortion syndrome.
<P>
<LI><B>Poverty</B> -- Regardless of race or socioeconomic background,
a high correlation exists between single parenthood and poverty.
 Of all children under age 6 living in poverty, 61 percent are
from single-parent families (1992).  In fact, children under age
6 from single-parent households are more likely to live in poverty
than not.
<P>
<LI><B>Breaking the cycle</B> -- For the child of a single parent,
the statistical odds of becoming an unwed mother later in life,
or fathering a child out-of-wedlock, are staggering.  One study
found that 80 percent of the girls who were mothers at 15 were
themselves daughters of teenage mothers.  Adoption can help break
that cycle.
</UL><P>
The American public overwhelmingly supports adoption policy. 
A recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans found
that, by a margin of 3-to-1, respondents favor efforts &quot;to
make it easier for children born out-of-wedlock to be adopted.&quot;
 And when presented with four options to resolve out-of-wedlock
teenage pregnancies, 33 percent of respondents thought it best
to &quot;have the child and put it up for adoption;&quot; 25 percent
thought it best for the mother &quot;to marry the child's father
and have the child;&quot; 13 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to have the child and raise it by herself;&quot; and only
10 percent thought it best for her to have an abortion.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE CURRENT STATUS OF ADOPTION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Even though most people agree that adoption is a good choice,
few exercise that option.  Only 6 percent of all teenage mothers
choose adoption for their babies; in the black community, adoption
accounts for less than one percent.  So while the number of potentially
adoptable children is theoretically large due to the high numbers
of out-of-wedlock births and crisis pregnancies, there remains,
ironically, a shortage of children.  An estimated one to two million
prospective parents are <I>still waiting to adopt a child</I>.
<P>
Perhaps one of the reasons why so few unwed mothers choose adoption
for their babies is that adoption frequently is not presented
to women as a viable choice.  One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors fail to include adoption as an option
in their counseling.  Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. 
Incredibly, some pregnancy counselors who thought adoption would
be a good choice still failed to present it as an option, because
they thought the girls would not want to hear about it.
<P>
Consequently, the number of adoptions reflects the lack of attention
adoption has received.  The latest available data show that 51,157
unrelated adoptions (adoptions by people not related to the child
by blood or marriage) of American children occurred in 1986. 
Of these 51,000-plus domestic adoptions, approximately one-half
were adoptions of healthy infants (under 2 years of age) of all
races and ethnic backgrounds.  The remaining adoptions were of
older kids or of children with special needs, i.e., physical,
mental, or emotional disabilities, part of a sibling group, etc.
<P>
In addition to the adoption of American children, there were 10,097
foreign-born children adopted by Americans in 1987.  However,
due to a decrease in the number of adoptions of South Korean children,
this figure has since declined to an estimated 6,500 adoptions
in fiscal year 1992.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>FURTHER POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Because of adoption's many benefits for both mother and child,
enabling more women to choose adoption should be a policy priority.
 Thus, in addition to the two proposals discussed earlier, the
Family Research Council recommends the following measures to make
the promotion of adoption more comprehensive.
<P>
(1)  Protocol for counseling women in crisis pregnancies should
include presentation of the adoption choice and its manifold benefits.
 This protocol should be used by counselors regardless of their
place of employment, i.e., crisis pregnancy centers, public health
facilities, and abortion clinics.  Inherent in this recommendation
is the expectation that such counselors would be properly trained
and adequately informed about the adoption option.  Furthermore,
the development of maternity homes should also be encouraged as
a way to promote adoption, as such homes have higher rates of
relinquishment than do other facilities.
<P>
(2)  The Department of Health and Human Services should collect
data on all adoptions, both public and private.  Currently, the
federal government only tracks adoption through the public system,
and the data available on the private sector is both limited and
outdated.  Data collection would also be enhanced through the
use of uniform data collection measures in each of the states.
 In addition to tracking the number of adoptions, the federal
government should encourage social science research regarding
adoption's impact on adopted children, birthmothers, and adoptive
parents.  This would not only add to the slim body of knowledge
already existing, it would also heighten awareness of the adoption
choice.
<P>
(3)  Reduce the barriers for prospective parents to choose adoption.
 This would include removing the obstacles hindering transracial
adoptions, reforming the insurance code to guarantee coverage
for adopted special-needs children, and speeding up the process
by which foster children could be adopted.

<P>
The American Psychiatric Association is a leading private, clinical
professional organization.  Over the years, the APA increasingly
has promoted greater acceptance of homosexuality.  And now, some
APA members are trying to outlaw counseling to homosexuals who
desire to change their orientation.
<P>
The association's pro-homosexual position is not shared by some
of its own members, and it offends many people of faith.  For
example, APA member Dr. Roy H. Hart writes from a Jewish perspective
in <I>Psychiatric News</I> that organized psychiatry does not
choose to understand religion's aversion to homosexuality.  He
writes in the May 1994 edition, &quot;Americans have the highest
rate of church attendance and membership in the Christian world,
but psychiatrists contribute little to those statistics.  What
is ego-alien for the psychiatrist -- religion -- is the center
of existence for a vast segment of the population.&quot;[1]
<P>
APA President John McIntyre tried to bridge the chasm with religion
when, after a pilgrimage to the epicenter of Mormonism, Salt Lake
City, he commented on the &quot;improved dialogue between religion
and psychiatry.&quot;[2]
<P>
The bridge McIntyre began to build in 1994 is now crumbling with
the advent of the January 1995 issue of the <I>American Journal
of Psychiatry</I>, the APA's official publication.  That issue
contains an article by Franklin D. Jones and Ronald J. Koshes,
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; which adds salt to
an old wound.[3] The article is noteworthy for its poor review of
research.  Its quick initial turn-around along with its array
of revisions suggests that the <I>AJP</I> editorial staff ignored
normal review procedures in order to publish a politicized article.

<CENTER><H3>"HOMOSEXUALITY AND THE MILITARY"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Underwent an unusual review process.</B>  The article
was received by the <I>AJP</I> staff on July 14, 1993.[4] It was
subsequently revised four times before it was accepted June 17,
1994.[5] The first revision was received within four months, a very
brief time for this internationally recognized journal.  Following
the initial review there were at least three more revisions, suggesting
an unusual review process -- more like a dialogue than a peer-review
process.  In typical peer review, one or at most two revisions
are allowed. 
<P>
<B>2. Misrepresents the history of the military's homosexual
policy.</B>  The authors claim that the Pentagon's policy was
first formalized in 1982, and that the ban dates back to World
War II.[6] But the policy was formalized by President Carter and
became effective on January 16, 1981.  It was revised and updated
January 28, 1982.
<P>
The military's homosexual policy dates back to the British Articles
of War in 1775.  An individual was drummed out of the Continental
Army for attempted sodomy in 1778.[7] Prior to WW II, the legal
construction of the Articles of War and Army regulations were
broader in nature than today's.  Homosexual misconduct was prosecuted
under the categories of &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer&quot;
or, for enlisted members, &quot;conduct to the prejudice of good
order and military discipline.&quot;  After 1900, individuals
were punished for committing homosexual acts, which were lumped
under the rubric of sodomy.[8]
<P>
A WW I War Department circular, signed by the Surgeon General
in 1917, listed homosexuality as cause for rejection under the
category of &quot;psychopathic&quot; characteristics.[9] The 1921
enlistment standards included an implied homosexual policy excluding
people thought to be homosexual.[10] The right to make decisions
concerning the retention of enlisted men was delegated to relatively
low levels.  Discharges for &quot;inaptness or undesirable habits
or traits of character&quot; were handled under Section 8, Army
Regulation 615-360.[11]
<P>
The War Department's 1941 policy, which was harsher than previous
ones, emphasized that homosexual &quot;sodomists&quot; would not
be discharged but court-martialed.[12] Despite this increased penalty,
during the war there was an unofficial toleration of some homosexuals
because replacements were not guaranteed.  The policy was revised
in May, 1947 and, again, in 1949 to mandate that &quot;[h]omosexual
personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve
in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt
separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory.&quot;[13]
<P>
This fundamental was added to the Uniform Code of Military Justice
in 1951 with Articles 125 (act of sodomy) and 134 (assault). 
In September, 1958, Class III homosexuals (those who had committed
no homosexual act while in the military service) were furnished
honorable or general discharges based on the character of their
service.[14]
<P>
In the late 1970s, the Report of the Joint Service Administrative
Discharge Study Group recommended that the military reaffirm the
longstanding ban (indeed, it was more than 200 years old) on homosexuals
by incorporating into the policy the principled phrase, &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  It also called for
the phrase, &quot;processing (for separation) is mandatory unless...the
allegations are groundless,&quot; to be included in all subsequent
Department of Defense (DoD) directives.  It also recommended some
leniency in cases of &quot;unsuitability,&quot; i.e., those involved
in homosexual tendencies or acts between consenting adults would
be honorably discharged.[15]
<P>
The 1982 policy cited in the <I>AJP</I> article incorporates the
aforementioned recommendations but was first published during
the last days of President Carter's administration.  That policy
was replaced by a law signed by President Clinton on November
30, 1993.  The Pentagon published implementing regulations on
February 28, 1994.
<P>
<B>3. Misrepresents the homosexual discharge history</B>.
 The authors cite homosexual discharge numbers and costs from
a discredited 1992 General Accounting Office study.[16] Other studies
show that the GAO underestimated the scope of homosexual discharges
and overestimated the costs to the government.
<P>
The GAO report stated that it costs the government $27 million
annually to discharge homosexuals.  But that figure is misleading.
 The military has a fixed number of authorized personnel, established
by Congress.  The projected annual number of enlistments is directly
related to the projected number of losses to achieve the established
end strength.  The cost to train new service members and to separate
other members is determined from the projected number of enlistments
and losses.  Those are sunk costs tied to running the training
base and a change of a few percent is of no real financial consequence.
<P>
Given the size of the military, the number of homosexuals discharged
is small.  For example, from 1980 through 1991, a total of 8,427,872
people served in the military.  During that same period there
were 17,840 non-judicial administrative discharges for homosexuality
--  .0021 percent of all of those who served during that period.
 An unpublished Army study during the same period puts homosexual
discharges in perspective.  It found there were 3,153 administrative
discharges for homosexuality between 1983 and 1991 but five times
(13,655) more for alcohol abuse and four times (10,845) more for
personnel being overweight.
<P>
The article also fails to mention homosexual punitive separations
which were not included in the GAO report.  A study obtained from
the Pentagon under the Freedom of Information Act analyzed 100
Army cases from 1989 to 1992.  Forty-nine percent of those cases
involved children as victims.  Eighty-five percent involved victims
who had not consented, and five percent of the offenders were
HIV-positive.[17]
<P>
The same report summarized a 1992 incident at Fort Hood, Texas,
where 60 homosexual men [soldiers and civilians] met in a public
toilet next to a child care center.  The men cut holes in the
walls to permit sex between men in adjacent stalls.  The men also
installed a mirror to allow them to see the approach of intruders.
<P>
These homosexuals were indiscriminate in their choice of partners
and often engaged in sex within moments of entering the bathroom.
 Sexual acts included oral and anal sodomy, mutual masturbation,
and fondling of the buttocks.  All soldiers in this incident received
disciplinary discharges which would not have been measured by
the 1992 GAO study.  This information was neither cited by GAO
nor by the <I>AJP</I> review.
<P>
<B>4. Relies on debunked Kinsey research to distort the
estimate of homosexuals in the military.</B>  The authors state,
&quot;Most authors feel this [4 percent exclusively homosexual]
is too conservative and that about 7 percent to 10 percent are
primarily homosexual in orientation.  Kinsey et al. also found
that 37 percent of males between childhood and old age had experienced
homoerotic orgasm, and another 13 percent claimed to have had
homoerotic stimulation without overt contact.  If these epidemiological
data are reliable, the policy of the Department of Defense would
severely limit the induction and retention of service members...strict
adherence to the Kinsey data and the policy of the Department
of Defense would result in the elimination of every other soldier
(37 percent plus 13 percent) in today's military.&quot;[18]
<P>
Alfred C. Kinsey, an Indiana University zoologist, who authored
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I> in 1948, based his research
on 12,000 interviews.  Kinsey relied heavily on data gleaned from
criminals and extrapolated his findings to the general population.
 Psychologist Abraham Maslow said that Kinsey's work, like all
sex surveys, had a high margin of &quot;volunteer&quot; error
because many people are not honest or willing to talk about their
most intimate sexual secrets.[19] 
<P>
No reputable survey has replicated Kinsey's findings, and a number
of recent studies suggest that the homosexual population is considerably
less than 10 percent of the U.S. population.  For example, a 1991
national survey of sexually active adults done by the National
Opinion Research Center shows that 98.4 percent of adults were
exclusively heterosexual that year.[20] A 1993 survey by the Battelle
Human Affairs Research Centers found that only 1.1 percent of
all Americans are exclusively homosexual.[21] A survey conducted
by the Alan Guttmacher Institute in 1993 found that one percent
of men consider themselves exclusively homosexual.[22] And a 1994
National Health and Social Life Survey at the University of Chicago
found that 2.8 percent of men and 1.4 percent of women identified
themselves as homosexual or bisexual.[23]
<P>
A March 1994 article in the <I>American Journal of Psychiatry</I>
cites several surveys of American men showing the prevalence of
homosexuality.  For example, the National Survey of Men found
that only 1.1 percent of men have been exclusively homosexual
during the preceding 10 years.  Another study found that 2.4 percent
of men are currently homosexual.[24]
<P>
<B>5. Relies on outdated polls to indicate that the public
supports lifting the ban. </B>The article cites two surveys done
before the national debate to suggest that Americans now favor
lifting the ban.[25]  It does not cite surveys with contradictory
findings nor does it discuss these contradictions.
<P>
Public support for lifting the ban eroded as the debate intensified
in 1993.  Midway through the debate, support for lifting the ban
was no more than 40 percent.[26] A national poll by Fabrizio, McLaughlin
&amp; Associates in March 1993 found that a decisive 54 percent
to 37 percent of voters disagreed that President Clinton should
overrule military leaders such as General Colin Powell and require
the military to accept homosexuals.[27]
<P>
Most military personnel support the ban.  A February 1993 <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> survey found that 40 percent of service members
disapprove, on moral grounds, of lifting the ban and 46 percent
said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment decisions.
 Another 11 percent said flatly that they would not reenlist because
of it.[28] A February 1993 CNN/Gallup Poll found that 74 percent
of men who had not attended college opposed lifting the ban. 
This is the prime recruiting population.
<P>
In essence, this review selectively cites survey data to support
its position, implying that no other dissimilar results have been
found.  
<P>
<B>6. Ignores the law and relies on Clinton's inconsistent
policy.</B>  The article makes no mention of the military's homosexual
law which was signed by President Clinton on November 30, 1993.
 The authors suggest that the regulations will &quot;generate
a series of court cases based on the freedom of speech and self-incrimination
statutes of the U.S. Constitution.&quot;[29]
<P>
No doubt the new regulations will be contested in the courts.
 The fact that the law and the new regulations are inconsistent,
however, is significant.  This fact was ignored by the authors.
 Consider some of the problems:
<P>
<LI>The Clinton Administration interpreted the law to permit so-called
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals to serve.  This view, i.e., that
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals even exist, contradicts past
legal rulings and will lead to more homosexuals serving and fewer
investigations of their likely misconduct.
<P>
<LI>The regulations dropped the critical statement that &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  While Congress has
carried this principle forward in the law, Secretary of Defense
William Perry failed to include it in the regulations.[30]
<P>
<LI>The new policy potentially cripples military discipline by creating
a number of new obstacles before investigations can be started.
 Thus the regulations prevent commanders from investigating soldiers
for homosexuality without clear evidence that they have done something
criminally wrong.  According to Perry, attending gay pride parades,
frequenting gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.[31]
<P>
<LI>The &quot;Perry rules&quot; also prevent criminal investigation
agencies from looking into most cases of adult, private, consensual
sexual misconduct, e.g., sodomy and adultery.[32]
<P>
<LI>Under the Perry rules, and directly contrary to more than 200
years of military practice, the DoD no longer considers homosexual
or bisexual behavior a marker for increased security risk.  Questions
about homosexuality were removed from security background investigations,
and information discovered during a security investigation cannot
be used for adverse action without high-level political permission.[33]
<P>
Clinton's Pentagon appointees are now pointing to the constant
number of homosexual discharges as proof that the policy is fine
as implemented.[34] This is misleading.  Most homosexuals facing
discharge do not challenge their separation.  However, it takes
just one advocate to exploit the weaknesses in the regulations
and then a court, deferring to the &quot;military's&quot; interpretation,
will strike down the statute as unconstitutional.   
<P>
Meanwhile, many soldiers are uncertain about Clinton's policy.
 In October 1994, military sociologist Charles Moskos conducted
an informal survey of soldiers in Haiti.  He found that 39 percent
thought the policy too lenient, 36 percent thought it to be a
good policy, and 22 percent were not sure.[35]  
<P>
<B>7. Attacks current policy requiring military psychiatrists
to report homosexual service members.</B>[36] The military does not
recognize absolute doctor-patient confidentiality.  A military
physician treating someone for a disorder that disqualifies the
member from continued service is bound by the regulation to report
the situation.  This is important for deployment and health readiness
purposes.
<P>
<B>8. Distorts facts about allied military experiences
with homosexuals.</B>  The article states, &quot;a survey of the
policies and practices of NATO armies revealed that only 24 percent
(4 of 17: New Zealand, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United
States) had exclusionary and separation policies.&quot;[37] The authors
ignore the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in the Military:
 Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[38] This report
certainly could have been obtained and cited, given the number
of allowed revisions.  The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected
four countries for detailed analysis.  The report states that
11 countries have policies that do not permit homosexuals to serve
in the military, 11 have policies that do.  Three of the latter
11 countries do not have any laws, regulations, or policies that
address this issue.  An unpublished Pentagon study conducted in
December 1992 found that some of those countries that permit homosexuals
to serve do so with strict guidelines. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The German armed forces, which are included among those that
do <I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[39] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<B>9. Falsely claims that most societies approve of homosexuality.</B>
 The article states, &quot;Cultural studies....  In the early
1950s Ford and Beach studied 77 modern primitive societies concerning
attitudes toward homosexuality.  They found 28 condemned in which
it was condemned but 49, nearly two-thirds, in which it was approved
in more or less restricted forms.&quot;[40]
<P>
This observation is misleading.  Most modern societies consider
homosexuality a mental illness.  For example, a 1992 survey by
the APA's Office of International Affairs in conjunction with
the APA Committee of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Psychiatrists
surveyed 125 psychiatric associations around the world.  It found
that all but three associations consider homosexuality a mental
illness or a sexual deviation.  U.S. psychiatrists are joined
only by Denmark and South Africa in their efforts to redefine
homosexuality and protect the &quot;right&quot; of homosexual
adults to conduct consensual sexual relations in private.[41]
<P>
<B>10. Misrepresents the pathological implications of
homosexuality.</B> The article cites a 1945 study of 183 former
college students known to be homosexual who served in the military
during World War II.  Sixty-four percent of these people &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  The review also attributes the military's
decision no longer to view homosexuality as a mental illness to
the APA's 1973 decision to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders-II.[42]
<P>
The article states that only 64 percent of homosexuals in their
study had credible service records.  Rather than being an indication
of success, this should be an argument for exclusion.  Better
than 90 percent of the 8.5 million World War II era veterans &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  
<P>
The implication is that since 64 percent in a single study had
&quot;credible&quot; records, there is no justification for the
exclusion.  This proves nothing.  They were honored for their
&quot;credible&quot; service to their country, not their homosexual
behavior.  After all, the ban was in force, so homosexuals were
forced to curb their behavior. 
<P>
The history of the American Psychiatric Association's decision
to change the DSM-II is worth examining.  Specifically, the military's
World War II experience provided considerable insight into human
behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally rewrote
the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric disorders
which, ultimately, became the format used by the American Psychiatric
Association in the 1980s and 1990s.  In 1952 the APA Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.  The nomenclature identified
homosexuality as a pathologic behavior, i.e., &quot;sexual deviation,&quot;
under the section on Sociopathic Personality Disturbances.[43]
<P>
The second edition of the DSM for Mental Disorders continued to
identify homosexuality as a &quot;sexual deviation&quot; disorder.
 And since 1945 the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[44]
<P>
From 1969 to 1971, homosexual activists stormed the annual meetings
of the APA demanding the normalization of homosexual behavior.
 In 1971 homosexual activists invaded the annual meeting, screaming
and kicking, seizing microphones, and denouncing psychiatry as
&quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[45]
<P>
The DSM was challenged at the 1973 meeting of the New England
Psychiatric Society by homosexual activists.  They recommended
that the nomenclature's section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
be renamed &quot;sexual dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year APA
Trustees ruled that homosexuality would no longer be listed as
a &quot;mental disorder&quot; in its official nomenclature of
mental disorders and recommended that it be replaced by the term
&quot;sexual orientation disturbance.&quot;[46]
<P>
According to author Ronald Bayer in <I>Homosexuality and American
Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis</I>, homosexual activists
used intimidation to force the APA to remove homosexuality as
a mental illness from the DSM of psychiatric disorders.  &quot;The
result was,&quot; explained Bayer, &quot;not a conclusion based
upon an approximation of the scientific truth as dictated by reason,
but was instead an action demanded by the ideological temper of
the times.&quot;[47]
<P>
Homosexuality was subsequently regarded as a variant of sexual
orientation disturbance.  The &quot;nomenclature revolution&quot;
continued and in 1986 the last remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic
homosexuality,&quot; was removed from the DSM.  This was done
over the protest of many psychiatrists who preferred to label
it a long standing disturbance originating in the early years
of life.[48]
<P>
The membership of the American Medical Association disagreed with
the APA's decision.  A 1975 AMA membership survey found that 69
percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[49]
 Additionally, psychotherapists such as Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald
van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi, Charles Socarides, and Masters
and Johnson have reported much success helping homosexuals to
recover, thereby proving the point that it is curable.[50]
<P>
<B>11. Claims military homosexuals would not contribute
to poor morale.</B>  The article proposes three points concerning
military morale.  First, it blames immature recruits for the anti-homosexual
policy but fails to cite supporting data.  &quot;Many recruits,
who may be insecure in their own sexual orientation, may react
with various forms of discomfort to the presence of an identified
homosexual person.&quot;[51] Second, it acknowledges that &quot;subcultures
in a military organization can disrupt functioning of the unit...since
the military copes with many subcultures, it remains for the military
to make a convincing case that this [homosexual] subculture is
substantially and essentially so much more damaging&quot; to justify
&quot;the costs of [the] current policy.&quot;[52] The military's
significant experience with drug and alcohol subcultures provides
ample experience with damaging categories of behavior.  Finally,
the authors state, &quot;We expect that acceptance of homosexuals
in the military will increase, negating the need for a walled-off
subculture and resulting in more respect for the homosexual soldier.&quot;[53]
 The authors provide no reason or basis for this supposition.
<P>
Morale is defined as &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to do so with &quot;...a strong sense of enthusiasm.&quot;
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to bind their basic identity with their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated&quot;
or, in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  Another group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these statistics
aren't enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct
Unbecoming</I> and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right
to Serve</I> provide, perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to
the disruptive nature of homosexuals in military units.
<P>
The voice of experience also indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[54] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[55]
<P>
<B>12. Contends, against the evidence, that homosexuals
aren't a security risk</B>.  The article states that identifying
oneself as a homosexual is no more of a security risk than identifying
oneself as a heterosexual.  The authors call for the government
to show a &quot;nexus&quot; between the presence of homosexuals
and adverse impact on duty performance.[56]
<P>
This is a flawed argument.  Few people identify themselves as
heterosexual; that identity is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed,
identify themselves, however.
<P>
The article ignores the landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin
Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and
Women</I>, which found that a significant number of homosexuals
report that &quot;someone has threatened [them with] exposure
of homosexuality in order to get something of value.&quot;[57]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail was the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition would be justified.
 However, for the many reasons cited in this analysis, homosexuals
should not serve openly and security investigations are a valid
mechanism for enforcing the ban.
<P>
<B>13. Contends, against overwhelming evidence, that homosexuals
are not a special health risk.</B>  The article virtually ignores
the documented health risks associated with the homosexual lifestyle,
citing only the military's HIV screening program.  &quot;By policy,&quot;
the authors explain, &quot;no one who tests positive for the HIV
virus is allowed to enter active duty.&quot;[58]
<P>
Admitting open homosexuals into the military violates the legal
principle of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that
if you know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain
when the risk materializes.  The review's authors denigrate a
very serious risk.
<P>
A recent report from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection, but that blood tests during this period
do not find the HIV.[59] This means that the military assumes the
risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that soldiers
will not be infected.  This is why screening out high-risk groups
and not just those who test positive for HIV is smart.  Unfortunately,
the Clinton Administration no longer screens out homosexuals --
the highest-risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[60]
<P>
&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units of blood
were drawn and directly transfused to Somalis.  The urgency of
such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS virus.]
<P>
&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot;  [The CDC reports that
most of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[61] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[62] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a leading homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for being
exposed to hepatitis B.&quot;[63] ]
<P>
&quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[64] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and about a third (35 percent)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that homosexual
men use condoms only 1 time in 4.[65]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one lifetime sex partner, 55 percent have had 2
to 19 lifetime partners, and 25 percent have had 20 or more lifetime
partners.[66]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had 2 to 4 partners,
17 percent had 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent had 11 to 20, and
17 percent report having had 21 or more sex partners.[67] However,
that survey excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of
the population and who typically have more conservative sex lives.
 Thus the real figures probably are even lower for the population
of all men.[68]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
or have early-stage HIV, test negative at first, and be accorded
full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This is about
$120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[69]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[70]  However, he warns that
this is in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases,
and assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries
will use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year
cost could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[71]
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[72] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and to $639,000 by the year 2008.[73]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated from the service, but,
at that time, 1,580 were still on active duty.  Their status precluded
them from deploying overseas and necessitated special assignments
and special medical care.[74]
<P>
Homosexuals also have a much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals,
as indicated by a study of more than 6,400 obituaries in 16 homosexual
newspapers.  The average age of homosexuals who died from AIDS
is 39; from all other causes it is 41.[75]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse are called the second set of key
health problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (and violence
is third).[76]
<P>
Screening out homosexuals and discharging those discovered later
makes financial sense.  The 1992 GAO report states that the military
spent $26 million on homosexuals discharged.  The military spent
many times that figure treating homosexuals with AIDS -- people
who lied to enter the military and now receive full health and
pay benefits.  The cost-effective decision would be to minimize
the risk to the federal taxpayer by rejecting homosexuals before
they are recruited and discharging those later discovered.
<P>
<B>14. Cites legal challenges as indication that public
will soon favor homosexual service.</B>  The article briefly reviews
the current judicial climate regarding the military policy.  The
authors believe, &quot;With the increased public attention now
focused on the miliary policy, swift changes could sweep away
previous positions.&quot;[77]
<P>
The article cites two cases won by the government and the case
of Navy Petty Officer Keith Meinhold, who was discharged for saying
he was gay on national television.  Meinhold's case was labeled
&quot;the most recent legal case decided.&quot;[78]
<P>
Meinhold's case is not the most recent case decided.  The case
of former midshipman Joseph C. Steffan from the U.S. Naval Academy
was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
on November 22, 1994.  The decision from the country's &quot;second
highest court&quot; declared the military's homosexual ban constitutional.[79]
<P>
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled August
31, 1994 that a statement of homosexuality alone is insufficient
reason to discharge Meinhold.  That decision was limited only
to sailor Meinhold and struck down the lower court's decision
to extend the ruling to the entire Defense Department.[80]
<P>
Although numerous cases of former service members discharged for
homosexuality are now in the judicial system, there is no indication
that &quot;swift changes&quot; will &quot;sweep away previous
positions.&quot;  On the contrary, it is expected that the 104th
Congress will force the Clinton Administration to enforce the
homosexual law despite rulings that are in conflict with the law.
<P>
The issue of homosexuals in the military was cited as one of the
pivotal issues that collapsed the Democratic Party's majority
in Congress.  The new majority should respond by reinstating the
full homosexual ban, i.e., require the Clinton Administration
to obey the new homosexual law and to reintroduce the questions
for recruits at induction.
<P>
<B>15. Concludes that the ban is based solely on bad attitudes.</B>
 The article states, &quot;The strongest argument for excluding
and separating homosexual persons from military service is 
not mental illness or security risks but the presence of social
strictures and adverse attitudes.&quot;[81]
<P>
The authors ignore a wealth of information that comes from Congress's
oversight hearings in 1993.  Reasons include combat readiness
(cohesion, deployability risk, family and community risks); manpower
(recruitment and retention risks); cost (medical, housing, claims
from soldiers previously discharged for homosexuality, quality
of force sustainment, and lost productivity); and political (military
used as laboratory for social experimentation to satisfy the political
views of a small minority).  The article completely ignores these
concerns.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; is an article that
was rushed to press, was poorly reviewed, and does little for
the academic credibility of the APA -- an organization that should
be promoting sound research, not a moral agenda that abuses and
neglects available research.  The article is evidence that the
APA is playing an ever greater role in the promotion of the homosexual
agenda.

<P>
In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of [the] problem is the inordinate
number of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;[1]  He also
conceded that &quot;there's no question that [ending welfare for
unwed mothers] would work.  The question is... 'Is it morally
right?'&quot;[2]
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There can be no more important policy objective than the preservation
-- or more properly in this day and age, the revitalization --
of our nation's moral capital.  As James Q. Wilson wrote in his
oft-cited article, &quot;The Rediscovery of Character: Private
Virtue and Public Policy&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root, in almost
every area of important public concern, we are seeking to induce
persons to act virtuously....  Not only is such conduct desirable
in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if large improvements
are to be made in those matters we consider problems.[3]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
Even so unlikely a source as Bruce Reed, President Clinton's leading
aide on welfare reform, acknowledges that the essential purpose
of reform must be to reverse the alarming rise in out-of-wedlock
births.[4]  If not driven exclusively by AFDC &quot;benefits,&quot;
the increase has at least been sustained and perpetuated by the
expansion of a system that pays recipients to bear illegitimate
children.  Current trends indicate that by the year 2015 -- some
studies project as early as 2000 -- one of every two American
babies will be born to a single mother, and illegitimacy will
surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness.  If a job
program succeeds in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work (which is unlikely on a sufficiently grand scale, given budget
constraints), we will still be left with roughly the same number 
of fatherless children.  While
Great Britain has already succeeded in implementing reforms that
make work economically more attractive than welfare, the reforms
of the 1980s have only served to underscore in both Britain and
America the fact that little progress can be made without addressing
the collapse of the family.[5]
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years (and chronicled for popular consumption
by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead in her April 1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article,
&quot;Dan Quayle Was Right&quot;) has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for much more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.  As social
scientist Charles Murray has written, single parenthood is &quot;damaging
to children in so many ways that to list them individually would
be to trivialize them.&quot;[6]
<P>
Not surprisingly, Dr. Murray also concludes that &quot;illegitimacy
is the single most important social problem of our time...because
it drives everything else.&quot;[7]  More than 70 percent of all
juveniles in state reform institutions, for example, come from
fatherless homes; and the relationship between crime and one-parent
families is so powerful that controlling for family structure
erases the relationship between crime and race and between crime
and low income.  Illegitimacy feeds itself, too.  Young white
women who grow up without a father in the home are more than twice
as likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and to do so during
their teenage years when they are most likely to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood the importance
of middle class norm-setting.  &quot;The way to reintegrate the
deviant into society, she argued, is to educate and indeed direct
them toward the shared values of the mainstream culture.&quot;[8]
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart virtues that temper
and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms must give way.  So,
too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders understood them.
 Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said, is the only true
basis of equality and the only requisite for citizenship.[9]  As
Charles Murray made clear in his now famous op-ed &quot;The Coming
White Underclass,&quot; either we act now to reduce illegitimacy
and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment to higher
and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging the entire
experiment in democratic self-government.
<P>
Or, as Michael Novak put it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he project of self-government depends on the capacity of citizens
to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?  The project of
self-government is moral -- or not at all.[10]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Founding Fathers and many succeeding generations understood
that only a virtuous people can be free.  Do we?
<P>
Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding
community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this
world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be
regarded as a morally neutral act.  In a report issued in December
1994, the Progressive Policy Institute, policy arm of the Democratic
Leadership Council, joined others in acknowledging that &quot;it
is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and
men to make babies they cannot support emotionally and financially.&quot;[11]
 Donna Shalala made the same concession a year earlier, however
reluctantly, when she said in an interview, &quot;I don't like
to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children
out-of-wedlock is wrong.&quot;[12]
<P>
Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to sanction
such activity by subsidizing it.  Republican strategist Bill Kristol
has said that &quot;neither our politics nor our sociology can
ultimately be neutral as to the content of the _laws of Nature
and Nature's God,_&quot;[13] chief among which is the fact that
we were made to live in families.  Charles Murray asks rhetorically:
 if &quot;a social policy that induces people to believe that
they are not responsible for their lives is one that inhibits
the pursuit of happiness and is to that extent immoral[,] [c]an
then a policy that <I>fails</I> to stigmatize be a moral one?&quot;[14]
<P>
Historical experience, related by Marvin Olasky and others, does
indeed demonstrate that the most effective social services have
been offered by private community groups, without any illusion
of moral neutrality.  In her seminal historical study <I>Poverty
and Compassion</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb writes that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[a]fter making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and _value-free,_ we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.[15]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
George Liebmann says, more simply, in a recent issue of <I>The
American Enterprise</I>, &quot;Rescuing an underclass is by definition
a highly moralistic undertaking.&quot;[16]  While controlling welfare
spending is a happy byproduct of terminating benefits to teen
mothers, even more promising is the opportunity to begin reversing
the message of the counterculture that has so eroded the character
of our people, in part by assaulting the family.
<P>
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the phrase &quot;defining
deviancy down&quot; to describe Americans' tendency to ignore
excess levels of deviancy by normalizing what used to be considered
pathology.  Only by &quot;defining deviancy down&quot; have we
been able to ignore until now all the signs of impending disaster
that attend a burgeoning illegitimacy rate.  Barbara Whitehead's
1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article heralded a real and significant change
in the public mood, however; and the near-mythic ascendancy of
Charles Murray's &quot;Coming White Underclass&quot; piece the
same year seemed to confirm a general convergence of public opinion.
 In a recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans,
a substantial majority (81 percent) of respondents indicated that
&quot;women having babies out of wedlock that they can't support
financially&quot; is a serious problem.  The mounting public consensus
presents a unique opportunity to implement more than symbolic
change in the 104th Congress and to make sanctions against illegitimacy
the focus of that change.
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[W]elfare programs, [he said], must contribute to the attack
on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy. . . .  Unless such
problems are dealt with effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping
the strength of society as a whole and extending their consequences
in troubled families from one generation to the next.[17]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Kennedy's insight about the consequences has proven historically
accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach to curbing illegitimacy
worked no better than the current President's will -- a fact which
an unnamed aide on the Clinton welfare task force acknowledged
last year.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, his aide confided to <I>Newsweek</I>
reporter Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs
around the country that were trying to deal with this problem,
and not one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any
results.&quot;[18]  Likewise, a formal study of the Teenage Parent
Demonstration, sponsored by the Department of Health and Human
Services in response to &quot;persistently high rates of teenage
pregnancies and births,&quot; found that &quot;[t]he program had
an unusual and disappointing pattern of impacts on pregnancy and
birth rates . . . despite . . . the substantial efforts of the
programs to empower [the] young mothers to take control of their
fertility.&quot;[19]
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <I>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</I>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families.&quot;[20]  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage
mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient, to restore the
integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers -- of any age --
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.  It is the
potential to reverse that sad experience that must define &quot;compassion&quot;
in the present debate.  As the one policy option that promises
to effect change in the current system, restrictions on benefits
by definition constitute the compassionate alternative.
<P>
Himmelfarb notes that the word &quot;compassion&quot; once described
&quot;a moral sentiment, not a political principle, a sentiment
evoked by _misery_ or _sorrow,_ not by poverty as such.&quot;[21]
 As political salvationism sought to preempt traditional morals
in the last 30 years, it was only natural that moral sentiments
should be confused with political principles.  Likewise, that
misery and sorrow should be equated with material poverty; for
the redefinition of compassion required a highly artificial view
of man as no more than a material being.
<P>
If compassion is once again properly understood, perhaps then
it will become more obvious that the object of our concern must
be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot; not economic poverty,
and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident today is the spiritual
and moral deprivation visited upon dependents of the welfare system.
 It is time that we stop suppressing the moral responsibilities
that make life precious for a resident of the inner city just
the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.  It is time, in short,
to secure equal access to the central satisfactions of family,
virtue, and freedom.

<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear with some justification that the
cap could promote an increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates
who support the measure share both this concern and the long-term
goal of driving abortions to the point of zero.  Unlike the more
conventional conflict between pro-life and pro-choice groups,
pro-life differences over the family cap represent a dispute over
means, not ends, that is complicated by the absence of any hard
data from actual experimentation.
<P>
Such differences lend themselves to reasoned discussion and, ultimately,
resolution far more easily than the larger debate for and against
abortion rights, which Laurence Tribe has characterized as a &quot;clash
of absolutes.&quot;  While the choice between life and death cannot
be accurately described as a &quot;clash of absolutes,&quot; the
phrase does capture usefully the impossibility of winning adherents
to the pro-life cause without first changing hearts, one at a
time.  In other words, we should forfeit no battles, but neither
can we expect to win the war against abortion on demand without
a comprehensive, long-term strategy to develop and sustain a pro-life
consensus.
<P>
While a pro-life position must be part of the agenda for national
renewal, opposition to abortion must be only one plank of the
pro-life platform.  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on
demand requires a transformation of the political and moral culture
as well as a reform of law.  Reducing illegitimacy is the <I>sine
qua non</I> of moral reconstruction; and right-to-life activists
should realize that, as one of the few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy
arsenal, the family cap not only serves their cause in the long-term
but deserves their active support in the short-term -- subject
to the critical qualification that there must be no attendant
funding for abortions.
<P>
No hard data are available to demonstrate that the family cap
stimulates the abortion rate.  And there is reason to think that
the family cap will <I>not</I> increase abortions, even in the
short-term.    
<P>
Feminists and welfare rights activists argue that the current
benefits level is already far too low to cover the costs associated
with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical to maintain that a cap
would have a sufficiently significant impact on the &quot;affordability&quot;
of another child to necessitate such a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, anyhow, is far more than an economic calculation.
 Twenty years of spiraling illegitimacy rates in the face of liberalized
abortion laws demonstrate that many individuals do not regard
abortion as a viable option.  Policy data collected by the Family
Research Council suggest that abortion is even less acceptable
to poor women;[1] and an article recently published in <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I> found that abortion rates for teen welfare
mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages for all teenage
girls.[2]
<P>
Those who are tempted to conclude that it is the availability
of welfare checks that reduces the abortion rate, relative to
the general population, should keep in mind the basis of comparison.
 That hypothesis -- that limited cash benefits suppress the abortion
rate -- would predict a <I>lower</I> rate of abortion in the general
population, relative to welfare mothers, because the average member
of the general population has more economic resources at her disposal.
 The empirical data, however, refute the hypothesis; and Douglas
Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute has commented that,
to the contrary, &quot;[k]ids who have less to lose . . . are
less likely to have an abortion.&quot;[3]       
<P>
The finding that abortion rates for teen welfare mothers are lower
than national averages for all teenage girls is a powerful suggestion
that non-economic factors determine the decision to carry a child
to term.  Other research supports the claim that, whether conception
was intended or not, most illegitimate births to underclass women
today are &quot;wanted.&quot;[4] Certainly, there is ample anecdotal
evidence to suggest that some girls have babies because they want
&quot;something to love&quot; -- or, worse yet, because their
peer group has perversely defined a baby as a status symbol.[5]
<P>
Others, including the young welfare mother who testified before
a recent congressional hearing on illegitimacy, simply believe
that abortion is wrong and choose not to compound their first
mistake by committing another.  While poverty dispirits some lives,
in others it serves to highlight the intangibles that make life
most sacred.  The point of decrying moral deterioration among
the underclass is to assert an easily forgotten truth: every person,
regardless of economic status, is capable of the very moral commitments
that argue most forcefully against abortion.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap would be the number
of lives saved in the short-term -- if such a number could be
approximated in the future as it cannot be now.  The question
itself is a red herring because it obscures the larger and more
important issue: &quot;What constitutes progress toward ending
altogether the culture that finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
Deciding on a rational means to maximize the total number of lives
saved in fact requires two sets of measures for maximizing that
good -- human lives saved in the short-term and human lives saved
over the course of several generations.  Since the policy changes
under consideration affect illegitimacy and the structure of the
welfare system, the number of lives saved in the long-run should
include both children who would have been aborted as well as the
children who would have fallen prey to the violent crime that
results from, as James Q. Wilson put it, &quot;neglecting the
processes by which the underclass reproduces itself.&quot;[6]
<P>
While there is no point at which the short-term perspective loses
relevance, few would dispute that there exists some point at which
the long-term implications demand consideration.  If it is true
that preserving the current benefits package will save lives,
presumably we could save even more lives by increasing the entitlements
tenfold.  Yet, most right-to-life activists intuitively understand
that there is an alternative good to be served by restricting
benefits that will in no way compromise our commitment to life.
<P>
Charles Murray wrote in his 1988 book <I>In Pursuit of Happiness
and Good Government</I>, in a passage that defined the parameters
and the language of the above analysis: &quot;It cannot be . .
. that the objective of a program is to save lives.  It may be
the <I>operational</I> measure of success, but it cannot be the
<I>construct</I> . . . because it has no discriminatory power.
. . .  One can too easily think of measures that will save lives
efficiently but are also totalitarian.&quot;[7]
<P>
The construct we are really interested in is &quot;advancing the
pro-life cause,&quot; which we may attempt to operationalize by
estimating the total number of lives saved now and later as a
result of the proposed policy change -- in this case, the family
cap.  And there is no question that reducing illegitimacy by imposing
restrictions on welfare benefits will serve the over-arching purpose
of the pro-life movement.
<P>
As Chuck Donovan explained in a paper published by the Family
Research Council, it is a basic statistical fact that marital
status and the abortion rate are inextricably linked.  The vast
majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women -- and
the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, therefore, we
should reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy
that create a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.
<P>
Right-to-life activists who oppose measures to reduce illegitimacy
are helping to sustain the very system that encourages young women
to find themselves in the predicament that makes abortion seem
as attractive as it possibly could.  Opposition to the family
cap is a curiously negative way to affirm life.  Although it should
be noted that many pro-life advocates are the ones on the front
lines offering material assistance to unwed mothers who do decide
to keep their babies, it would be far more compassionate to try
to preclude the need for that help in the first place.
<P>
Glenn Loury and James Q. Wilson argued convincingly at recent
welfare hearings before the Human Resources subcommittee that
the problems of illegitimacy and abortion are moral -- not material
-- problems.  They require spiritual solutions which no government
can provide directly.  Yet, Loury writes, &quot;in every community
there are agencies of moral and cultural development that seek
to shape the ways in which individuals conceive of their duties
to themselves, of their obligations to each other, and of their
responsibilities before God.&quot;[8]
<P>
In many communities, right-to-life organizations are those very
agencies, and they deserve credit and gratitude they don't often
receive.  By gradually eliminating federal benefits, poor women
who are pregnant out of wedlock will be forced to turn to local
organizations, including right-to-life crisis pregnancy groups,
that will counsel against abortion and discourage further irresponsible
behavior.
<P>
Launching the arguments against illegitimacy in the context of
the current debate over those benefits will give new rhetorical
emphasis and more widespread attention to the arguments against
abortion; for, the two ills spring from the same misconception
that life is cheap and motherhood bears no sacred responsibility.
 Indeed, the bipartisan focus on illegitimacy is one of the most
golden opportunities we have had in quite some time to reverse
the message of the counterculture that has made abortion &quot;rights&quot;
seem palatable.
<P>
Yet, to increase the logic and appeal of pro-life arguments to
a significant number of people who do not now see the moral force
in such arguments, we must begin the task of rebuilding other
civic institutions that will nourish human souls and liberate
them to fulfill their full potential.  Such an ambitious project
will require a multifaceted strategy, and eliminating the welfare
benefits that encourage illegitimacy will be a key component of
that strategy.
<P>
The interconnections linking functioning communities with functioning
families are so rife and so apparent that even Democrats now concede
Dan Quayle was right.  Illegitimacy, by definition, is the failure
of families to form in the first place; and by driving a host
of social problems that corrode communities and erode the national
character, illegitimacy promotes the failing of family on a grand
scale.
<P>
Charles Murray writes that affiliation -- including family affiliation
-- is a means whereby people of common values are enabled to enact
those values.  A functioning community that promotes a wide array
of affiliations provides an extremely important venue both for
practicing virtue and for passing down to the next generation
the habit of virtue.[9] The pro-life movement is itself a classic
example of people expressing their interests and values through
affiliations that are sustained by a rich network of institutions
outside of -- and sometimes even in opposition to -- government.
<P>
Arguably, members of the underclass do not now have the same type
of privilege; but they should and could if we begin, in Michael
Joyce's words, &quot;the resuscitation of the civic sphere which
alone makes genuine citizenship possible.&quot;[10] Because civil
institutions are the very institutions that cultivate character,
that &quot;appeal to and sustain spirit and heart as much as mind,&quot;[11]
reconstructing them will engender a far more lasting commitment
to pro-life principles than obstruction of the family cap.  Michael
Joyce has explained eloquently: &quot;Through . . . countless,
subtle, daily interactions, our civil institutions give form and
substance to the everyday qualities and values without which life
itself would be impossible.&quot;[12]
<P>
Paradoxical as it may seem, reforming the culture will be the
most expedient complementary strategy for winning new and permanent
legal victories against abortion.  If any issue position depends
on one's idea of man, it is abortion.  And an individual's idea
of man is not something that gives way to clever arguments in
court or the Congress.  Instead, it is shaped and formed from
childhood by the quiet but pervasive messages of the surrounding
society in which children grow and develop into adults.
<P>
In addition to changing notions of the individual, we must also
change the related conception of government.  If we succeed in
restoring a commitment to limited government, the courts will
be under increasing pressure to reverse the abortion decisions
that have, in George Weigel and Bill Kristol's analysis, &quot;[reduced]
the actors in American society to the coercive state and the radically
autonomous individual, bereft of all social ties and responsibilities.&quot;[13]
 There is no better way to undermine this &quot;America of strangers,&quot;
to use Richard John Neuhaus' phrase, than to restore the civil
institutions that nurture the daily interactions and affiliations
that are anathema to the proponents of centralized government.
<P>
Right-to-life advocates give collective voice to a magnificent
idealism in our political discourse.  To them, it does not matter
that a decrease in abortions will mean a disproportionate increase
in minority babies born to low-income parents.  It does matter
that abortions end innocent lives because life is eminently sacred
and precious.
<P>
Thus, pro-lifers should understand more fully than anyone in the
debate over the family cap that abortion is not an issue that
can be nickel-and-dimed or reduced to a scientific calculation
of anticipated marginal changes in the abortion rate.  The very
attempt threatens, however unintentionally, to promote the same
thoroughly dehumanized and despiritualized view of life in which
pro-abortion forces indulge.
<P>
If our objective is to find a rational means to maximize the number
of lives saved over time, it bears repeating that, for Aristotle,
&quot;conformity with a rational principle&quot; meant something
far more humane than a cold mathematical calculation of odds.
 He distinguished between &quot;theoretical wisdom,&quot; which
is more akin to a scientific process, and &quot;practical wisdom,&quot;
defined as &quot;the capacity of deliberating well about what
is good and advantageous.&quot;  Aristotle knew that in making
decisions the best of statesmen would draw upon this more indefinable
wisdom that is an equal but different part of rationality.  So
should we draw upon the best part of our wisdom in evaluating
the costs and benefits of the proposed family cap.[14]
<P>
We should also bear in mind that what we think about the right
to life has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind
of society we should institute.  In the end, it really is not
possible to think about one in isolation from the other; or else
the arguments lose impetus, grow artificial and -- lifeless.
<P>
Not by coincidence, the Declaration speaks of &quot;life&quot;
in the same breath with &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;the pursuit
of happiness,&quot; two conditions that speak directly to the
question of how best to organize society.  The Founders instituted
a limited government to secure natural rights, including the right
to life; but as George Will noted in a recent editorial, &quot;Our
creed of limited government . . . [has a] corollary vision of
human capacities and of the life worth living,&quot; captured
by the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot;[15]
<P>
The Founders would have scoffed at the notion that the protection
of life and limb alone is an adequate notion of &quot;happiness,&quot;
and right-to-life activists forget that at their peril in the
present debate over the family cap.  By opposing the current system
of welfare benefits, we advocate a transformation of the political
and social culture that will sustain both &quot;happiness&quot;
and a more enduring pro-life consensus than even legal reform
can hope to accomplish.

<title>GOALS 2000: THE CASE FOR REPEAL</title>

<h2>GOALS 2000:<br>
THE CASE FOR REPEAL</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>
To an ailing American education system, Goals 2000 offers further
centralization, added bureaucracy, and federal coercion -- and
calls it a prescription for local freedom.
<p>
But Americans have overwhelmingly objected to the &quot;government
knows best&quot; philosophy of which Goals 2000 is another manifestation.
If the 104th Congress intends to keep its campaign promises of
decentralizing authority, returning power to states and localities,
empowering American families, balancing the budget, and reducing
the deficit, then Goals 2000 must be repealed. It is an impediment
to these goals. Leaving intact the Goals 2000 formula for restructuring
American education will undo any education reform Congress hopes
to accomplish.
<p>
Goals 2000 (P.L. 103-227) is the Clinton Administration's plan
to drastically restructure the American education system. &quot;Goals
2000 establishes overall direction for a new local-state-federal
partnership in education,&quot; writes Gordon M. Ambach, executive
director of the Council of Chief State School Officers.[1] It increases
the federal role by imposing a congressional formula for reform
on any state, school district, or school that wishes to receive
funding under this act.
<p>
The priority of the restructuring agenda can be seen in the appropriations.
Less than half the funding for Goals 2000 will reach local schools
in this first year of its existence. Of the $105 million appropriated
for Goals 2000 in FY 94, $92.4 million (88 percent) is targeted
toward state grants. Stipulations in the law require that only
45 percent of each state's grant be filtered down to individual
schools.[2] That means only $42 million, or 40 percent of the original
appropriation, will ever reach the schools. The other 60 percent
constitutes the bureaucratic skim that is being used at each level
to create the new framework for the educational system.
<p>
The danger of the Goals 2000 restructuring agenda is that all
future federal experimentation with education will be easily inculcated
into the new network. Local schools will be extremely vulnerable
to manipulation and have little, if any, autonomy.
<p>
The bureaucratic waste and ominous restructuring agenda of Goals
2000 are just the beginning of the argument against this legislation
that will radically change American education. Its ten titles
contain dozens of problem areas that warrant the repeal of Goals
2000.
<p>
<center><h3>TITLE I -- NATIONAL EDUCATION GOALS</h3></center>
<p>
This title codifies eight national education goals. Six were agreed
to in 1990 by governors and President Bush following the Charlottesville
education summit. The other two goals, parental participation
and teacher education, were added as bait to sell the Goals 2000
legislation to interest groups, such as teacher unions and the
PTA, which supposedly represent the views of teachers and parents.
<p><ul>
<li>The concept of national education goals is based on faulty
logic. If the federal government is setting goals, that presupposes
that it has the authority and ability to ensure the accomplishment
of the goals. Reaching national education goals will require an
unprecedented federal intrusion in schools.
<p>
<li>Had the goals been popularly developed and had Americans
asked for federal supervision in achieving them, Goals 2000 might
be procedurally, if not philosophically, a legitimate plan. They
did not and it is not. Secretary Riley reveals this as he retells
the history of the Goals 2000 legislation:
<p><ul>
In the first place, educators had not been in on the ground floor
when the National Education Goals were developed in 1989 and 1990.
The goals were viewed by many as a classic example of a top-down
reform imposed on localities.... Nor had parents, citizens, or
the business community been brought into the picture in a meaningful
way.... Finally, neither members of Congress nor state legislators
had a hand in crafting the goals.... The truth was that the reform
movement at the national level had absolutely no statutory basis....
The National Education Goals, three years after their announcement,
had no legal standing of any kind.[3]
</ul><p>
<li>National education goals cannot be reached through a <I>voluntary</I>
program. If the Clinton Education Department intends to reach
these goals, they certainly cannot believe that Goals 2000 is
voluntary, or at least they do not intend that it will be optional
for long. The goals are stated in section 102 using all-inclusive
language: &quot;all students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having
demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter...,&quot;
and &quot;every school in the United States will be free of drugs....&quot;
These goals absolutely cannot be accomplished through a voluntary
program. The crafters of this legislation were either deceived
or deceptive when they touted Goals 2000 as voluntary.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE II -- NATIONAL EDUCATION REFORM LEADERSHIP,<br>
STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTS</h3></center>
<p>
Understanding title II is key to understanding the significance
and danger of the Goals 2000 legislation. This title is the heart
of the restructuring agenda. It creates two new national bureaucracies:
the National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) and the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC).
<p>
The driving force of the Goals 2000 reform plan lies in title
II: <I>standards</I>. Three types of national standards are defined:
content standards, performance standards and opportunity-to-learn
standards. In order to apply for a grant under Goals 2000, each
state must develop its own content, performance and opportunity-to-learn
standards, or adopt the national standards in each of the three
areas (see title III).
<p>
Title II is very problematic for anyone who believes in a decentralized
system of education:
<p><ul>
<li>Clearly, adding bureaucracy is contrary to the goals of
this Congress. It will not lead to better education, only waste.
<p>
<li>Goals 2000 called for the creation of the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC) within 120 days of the
law's enactment (March 31, 1994) [Sec. 212(e)]. The council was
not named during that time, nor has it been since then, yet in
FY 94 $2 million was appropriated for its use. To what end were these
funds used?
<p>
<li>NESIC was to &quot;identify areas in which voluntary national
content standards need to be developed&quot; [Sec. 213(a)(1)(A)].
Since NESIC has not been formed it obviously has not performed
this function. Which bureaucrat decided what standards projects
would be funded? With such anonymity there is no accountability.
<p>
<li>The content standards are being presented to school personnel
and the general public as though they have been officially and
legally approved. Neither of these can happen because the body
set up by law to certify the standards -- NESIC -- does not exist.
It is misleading to present these as <I>the</I> &quot;national
standards&quot; when they have been neither federally nor popularly
approved.
</ul><p>
The <I>National Standards for United States History,</I> produced
by the Center for History in the Schools, are a case in point.
A politically correct account of American history, these standards
are being presented to history teachers as <I>the national standards</I>.
While Congress may believe it has addressed the issue with the
Senate's 99 to 1 vote to reject the U.S. history standards, this
non-binding resolution was merely symbolic. In Goals 2000, Congress
gave authority over the standards to NESIC. That makes the Senate's
resolution only a good gesture. Congress should follow this vote
to reject the history standards with a vote of much greater significance:
the repeal of the entire Goals 2000 legislation, which calls for
national standards and has the potential to produce more material
like the U.S. history standards.
<p><ul>
<li>The federal government should not be involved in the creation
of standards. Government-endorsed standards are by nature coercive,
not voluntary, and will create a body of &quot;official knowledge.&quot;
This is contrary to the American tradition of freedom of thought.
Furthermore, content standards deal with curriculum, an area which
the federal Department of Education was expressly forbidden to
enter when it was created in 1979. The creation, critique and
usage of standards must remain a community endeavor. No further
federal money should be spent on standards projects, and there
should be no federal certification or endorsement of existing
standards. Political involvement results in politically-charged
standards. Imagine the reaction of those unoffended by the original
history standards if new standards were developed under the leadership
of Sen. Jesse Helms or Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</ul><p>
Opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards are an especially troublesome
element of title II:
<p><ul>
<li>These standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing
inputs into education, a tried-and-failed method. OTL standards
chosen by states and school districts will require schools to
provide adequate resources -- including such things as gender-equitable
materials, curriculum aligned with national content standards,
and anything else NESIC deems appropriate.
<p>
<li>OTL standards are measuring sticks for schools and teachers,
not for students. They are not a reliable method for improving
student achievement. Indeed, numerous studies linking dramatically
increased spending and declining test scores indicate that spending
does not drive academic success.[4]
<p>
<li>OTL standards invite further federal intrusion in American
education. Diane Ravitch, an assistant secretary of education
in the Bush administration, wrote, &quot;[T]he new standards,
euphemistically called 'opportunity-to-learn' standards, would
permit Federal regulation of curriculum, textbooks, facilities
and instructional methods....The bill describes the Federal 'opportunity-to-learn'
standards as 'voluntary,' but litigation would quickly turn them
into mandates.&quot;[5]
</ul><p>
The idea of lawsuits and mandates is not an alarmist fabrication;
an Alabama state court recently declared the state school system
unconstitutional for not providing adequate education to its students.
The judge's 125-page opinion imposes OTL-type standards on the
state's schools.[6]
<p>
<center><h3>TITLE III -- STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATION<br>
SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT</h3></center>
<p>
This title authorizes block grants to states and subgrants to
local school boards [Sec. 309(a)].
<p><ul>
<li>In order to receive a grant under Goals 2000, a state is
obligated to adhere to the federal outline for reform: opportunity-to-learn
standards, content and performance standards, assessments, etc.
State improvement plans must be approved by the Secretary of Education.
Never before have states had to submit such lesson plans to the
federal government for approval. Contrary to the rhetoric of Goals
2000, this is not a formula for local authority over school reform;
it makes the word <I>voluntary</I> moot.
<p>
<li>In its grant application, a state must include &quot;an
assurance that State law provides adequate authority to carry
out each component of the State's improvement plan...&quot; [Sec.
305(a)(2)(B)]. In other words, the state must explain how it will
impose the Goals 2000 agenda on each of its school districts,
voiding the voluntary option for them as well.
<p>
<li>The Goals 2000 prescription for reform encourages states
to include plans to transform schools into &quot;one-stop shopping&quot;
centers which offer a variety of social services, including health
care and child care [Sec. 306(f)(2)]. This coordination of services
tends toward a collectivism which is contrary to our nation's
history as a free society. Concentrating the services in one place
and on one group of people may lead to a sense of dependency.
<p>
<li>Advancing social services, health care and related services
likely includes the promotion of school-based clinics (SBC). The
term &quot;coordinated services&quot; has been used by proponents
to refer to school-based clinics. These clinics commonly distribute
contraceptives and, when these measures fail, the clinics refer
for abortion.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE IV -- PARENTAL ASSISTANCE</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides for parental information and resource centers
and describes parental involvement in education. Laudable as it
sounds, this title is problematic:
<p><ul>
<li>Goal 8 (parental participation) and title IV (Parental
Assistance) assume that schools and parents have equal authority
over and responsibility for children. The legislation denies the
fact that parents' authority over their children is intrinsic
and that schools have only a delegated authority.
<p>
<li>To improve family life and help parents, Goals 2000 suggests
more programming, more meetings, more time at school and with
school personnel, and more home visits from professionals. All
of this leaves less time for parents and children to spend together.
<p>
<li>With their Goals 2000 grants, states must spend money on
&quot;parent education.&quot; Parents as Teachers (PAT), which
advocates home visits by counselors beginning at birth, is one
of the programs specifically endorsed by the law. Not only are
states encouraged to use their &quot;parent education&quot; money
to fund PAT programs, but the objectionable organization was directly
appropriated $10 million under Goals 2000 for FY 1995. The House
Education, Labor, HHS Subcommittee for Appropriations is to be
commended for targeting this program for termination. Its rationale
for proposing cuts to parent education programs is that &quot;these
are the very paternalistic and 'government knows best' programs
that the American people rejected last year.&quot;
<p>
<li>Publicly-funded institutions like PAT are not equipped
to improve families because they cannot speak to the values issues
inherent in the breakdown of families. Private voluntary associations
and individuals must take responsibility in this arena.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE V -- NATIONAL SKILL STANDARDS BOARD</h3></center>
<p>
Title V is devoted to linking education to business and industry.
It authorizes the creation of another national bureaucracy: the
National Skill Standards Board (NSSB). NSSB will establish business-education
partnerships and oversee development of skill standards and assessments.
<p><ul>
<li>The $3 million spent in 1994 to develop skill standards
is another misguided appropriation of funds. It also calls for
the development of national assessments to certify achievement
of the skill standards. These additions, however, will not produce
better candidates for business. According to a <I>Chicago Tribune</I>
article, employers seek critical thinking and creativity, but
when it comes to promoting those skills, &quot;most of the visible
school reform efforts, such as uniform national testing schemes,
head 180 degrees in the wrong direction.&quot;[7]
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VI -- INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM</h3></center>
<p>
Title VI calls for evaluation of foreign education systems. It
also sets up a program of education personnel exchange with central
and eastern European countries and any country formerly a part
of the Soviet Union.
<p><ul>
<li>The United States does not have the resources to &quot;provide
Department of Education personnel and technical experts to assist
eligible countries to establish and implement a database or other
effective methods to improve educational delivery systems, structure
and organization&quot; [Sec. 601(c)(5)]. Moreover, U.S. envoys
should not be pushing the Goals 2000 agenda, unproven in our own
country, on eastern European countries.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VII -- SAFE SCHOOLS</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides grants to local school districts to achieve
safe and drug-free schools. Section 705 describes types of programs
to be implemented to prevent violence.
<p><ul>
<li>Conflict resolution, anger management, and peer mediation
are cited as &quot;programs of demonstrated effectiveness in addressing
violence&quot; (Sec. 705). In reality, experts are skeptical of
these soft-approach violence prevention programs.[8]
<p>
<li>We cannot afford to spend millions on a violence prevention
strategy that includes programs of no proven effectiveness. Serious
efforts must be made to curb violence, but conflict resolution
and peer mediation will not get to the real solution: changed
lives and families.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VIII -- MINORITY-FOCUSED CIVICS EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides grants for teacher seminars on minority-focused
civics and government.
<p><ul>
<li>Minority-focused courses will likely promote versions of
history similar to that produced by the Center for History in
the Schools in its <I>National Standards for United States History.
</I>Such politicization of history will not produce acculturation
but cultural friction and fragmentation.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE IX -- EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT</h3></center>
<p>
Title IX makes organizational changes in the Department of Education's
Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI); prescribes
OERI's functions in relation to Goals 2000; establishes within
OERI a National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board,
five National Research Institutes, and a National Education Dissemination
System linking federal and local agencies. It also authorizes
expansion of research grants for comprehensive school health education
(Sec. 971).
<p><ul>
<li>Once again, Goals 2000 aims to improve education by adding
and reshuffling bureaucracy.
<p>
<li>Health education, which includes sex education, has already
been a major source of grief to parents. Advancing these programs
will undoubtedly lead to an increase in challenges to parental
authority.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE X -- MISCELLANEOUS</h3></center>
<p>
This catch-all title contains a gun-free school act, a non-smoking
policy for children's services in schools, a policy for distribution
of contraceptive devices, and authorization of grants for Midnight
Basketball programs.
<p><ul>
<li>The Goals 2000 policy on contraceptive devices further
marginalizes parents. Section 1018 states that &quot;all federally
funded programs which provide for the distribution of contraceptive
devices to unemancipated minors [shall] develop procedures to
encourage, <B>to the extent practical</B>, family participation
in such programs&quot; (emphasis added). How unlikely is it that
a school administrator will find it impractical to listen to parental
objections to a condom distribution policy?
<p>
<li>Midnight Basketball was originally a private sector plan.
There is no need for government to get involved in these charitable
efforts and regulate them to death.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
The Goals 2000 restructuring agenda will continue to spread like
kudzu throughout America as long as states receive Goals 2000
grants requiring them to submit their standards and assessments
for federal approval. Furthermore, zero-funding the Goals 2000
programs individually leaves open the possibility of future funding.
Complete repeal of Goals 2000 is the only solution.
<p>
Education reform calls for a reduction in the role of the federal
government in the system and a return to the traditional role
of school: teaching students basics like reading, writing, and
arithmetic. A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals
2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation
and spending.

<H2>IS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT<BR>
THROWING FIRST COURT<BR>
TEST OF MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL<BR>
LAW?</H2>

<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department appears to be throwing a key military homosexual
case by not calling expert witnesses to rebut the half-truths
presented by pro-homosexual witnesses like former Assistant Secretary
of Defense Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Six avowed homosexuals are contesting the military's homosexual
law in a Brooklyn federal district court case, <I>Abel et al.
v. William Perry</I>.  This is the first federal case challenging
the military's new law.  Plaintiffs allege that the military ban
violates equal protection and free speech rights and imposes punitive
rules unrelated to fitness and ability to serve.[1]
<P>
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil
Liberties Union are representing the homosexual servicemembers.
 They called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals.  Not one of those
witnesses was countered by expert defenders of the ban.[2]
<P>
The law is on solid constitutional ground.  Congress has the constitutional
responsibility for writing personnel laws for the military: Article
I, Section 8.  Congress conducted extensive hearings in both the
Senate and the House in 1993.  It then codified the military's
policy banning homosexuals, and President Clinton signed it into
law on November 30, 1993.  The law took effect on February 28,
1994.
<P>
Mr. Korb, who testified on March 16, is an apologist for homosexual
causes who now works for the Brookings Institute.  In the past,
he frequently has relied on a discredited study from the Defense
Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), which
contains much sloppy research and misinformation.
<P>
Some of Korb's statements on the topic deserve closer examination:
<P>
<LI><I>Army Times</I>, February 17, 1992.  Korb states: &quot; [PERSEREC]
 completed two 
studies that concluded: <I>Homosexuals are better prospective
military members than heterosexuals</I>; the Pentagon should engage
in empirical research to see if they can function appropriately
in military units; and the Pentagon should make judgments about
individuals based on conduct, not sexual orientation.&quot;
There is no evidence that &quot;homosexuals are better&quot; soldiers,
and the Pentagon's 1993 studies found conclusively that homosexuals
are a high-risk category of potential recruits. 
<P>
<LI><I>CNN</I>, &quot;Larry King Live,&quot; July 27, 1993.  Korb
said, &quot;[A]ccording to the Pentagon's own studies done out
in Monterey, <I>approximately 200,000 people in the military are
homosexuals.  So you're talking about 10 percent of the force</I>.&quot;
<P>
The cited &quot;studies&quot; relied on the discredited work of
sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey.  They exaggerate Kinsey's already
overblown findings of sexual deviance in the general population,
including the now-refuted 10 percent myth for homosexuality. 
Even Planned Parenthood, <I>The New Republic</I> and <I>Newsweek</I>
concede as much.  More reliable surveys indicate that the homosexual
population in America is less than two percent.
<P>
<LI> Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March
31, 1993.  Korb testified, &quot;Professor Theodore Sarbin, co-author
of a 1991 PERSEREC study for the U.S. military, has stated that
<I>there is no data linking gays to lower morale or cohesion</I>.
 Rather he (Sarbin) noted that where there's good leadership,
there's high morale.&quot;
<P>
This statement is without foundation.  PERSEREC omits any reference
to any scientific study of military unit cohesion and discipline
and their effect on combat readiness.  
<P>
The Pentagon's 1993 task force that studied the issue of homosexuals
in the military found hundreds of cases where servicemembers discovered
to be homosexual were very disruptive.  Mr. Korb's anecdotal account
is disputed by these cases.
<P>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99 percent of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine
the cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.[3] The Defense Readiness
Council compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[4]
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1994 case of <I>Margarethe Cammermeyer v. Les
Aspin</I>.  Korb told that court: &quot;The policy was never intended
to authorize the military to discharge someone simply based on
his or her status -- absent any evidence of conduct.  To the contrary,
conduct was the real focus of the policy....A servicemember's
own admission of being gay -- absent any indication of her propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct -- is simply not sufficient grounds
for discharging her under the existing policy....The policy I
authorized should not be construed as authorizing such an irrational
outcome.&quot;[5]
<P>
The military's pre-1993 ban was based on the principle that, &quot;Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;  Decades of court
rulings have affirmed the military's position that declaring oneself
a homosexual implies the person has or will engage in illegal
homosexual behavior.  
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1995 case of <I>Abel et al. v. William Perry</I>.
 Korb told the court, &quot;We were losing a lot of very good
people in whom the government had invested a lot of money.&quot;
 He also compared the homosexual exclusion with women in the military.
&quot;I can't over-emphasize the great opposition from military
leaders to ending the draft and bringing women into the services.&quot;
 Korb said he once shared a room with a homosexual without any
problem.
<P>
The military releases three times as many people each year for
drug abuse than it does for homosexuality.  And homosexuals in
the military have a bad record: as a group, they have a high ratio
of discipline problems and account for most of the AIDS cases.
<P>
Homosexual activists often try to compare their agenda with the
integration of blacks into the military.  Former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell does not agree:  &quot;Skin
color is a benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation
is perhaps the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.
 Comparison of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[6]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department and the Pentagon have many witnesses (active
duty and retired officers and civilians) who would refute the
half-truths presented by the pro-homosexual witnesses.  It is
inexplicable that in a politicized case like <I>Abel v. William
Perry,</I> the Justice Department failed to call experts to challenge
the misinformation promoted by homosexual groups.
<P>
The 104th Congress must demand that the Justice Department represent
the military's interests.  The evidence supports the military
homosexual law, but if the government is silent about the facts,
cases like this will be lost, and the destruction of military
morale will proceed unchecked.

<TITLE>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SCUTTLES FIRST COURT TEST OF MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL LAW</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<P>
<H2>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION<BR>
SCUTTLES FIRST COURT TEST OF<BR>
MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL LAW</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
In a lackluster performance, the Clinton Administration failed
to use key arguments and called no witnesses in the first court
test of the military's new homosexual law.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District
of New York struck down parts of the military's new homosexual
law and the Pentagon's implementing directives in the case of
<I>Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.[1]
<P>
Judge Nickerson ruled that six service members' First and Fifth
Amendment rights were violated when the military sought to discharge
them solely based on their admissions of homosexuality.  He enjoined
the Pentagon from discharging the six, and the Justice Department
is expected to appeal the case to the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals.
<P>
This case follows a pattern seen in the Steffan, Meinhold, and
Cammermeyer cases whereby the government ignores key arguments
for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals.  These cases demonstrate
fundamental differences between the law, which was signed by President
Clinton on November 30, 1993, and the Pentagon's implementing
directions, which took effect February 28, 1994.
<P>
Specifically, the Justice Department failed to:
<P><UL>
<LI>Call witnesses to represent the government's interest.  The
plaintiffs called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to dispute
long-held &quot;myths&quot; about homosexuals. 
<P>
<LI>Present well documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.
<P>
<LI>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence that
homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military
and therefore the military's ban is justified.  
</UL>
The judge noted key differences between the law and the directives:
<P><UL>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation
at the point of admission, the Clinton Administration has rejected
the questions.  The judge labeled this as unusual.  On one hand
the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not making homosexuality
part of a pre-induction litmus test) and then insists that the
homosexual remain secretive about his &quot;status.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the directives permit
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct.  This creates
a status/conduct dichotomy.  The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them for stating that
they are homosexual.  
<P>
The military law [10 U.S.C. 654(b)(2)] permits discharge when
&quot;the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or
bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further finding,
made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the
regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is
not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity
to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.&quot; 
The Pentagon's directives which implement this law [DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30] have the same litmus test.
<P>
The government argued that this is not a First Amendment issue
because the law and the directives are directed solely at the
prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to rebut
the presumption of misconduct.  However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct.  In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> GOVERNMENT FAILED TO EXPLAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HOMOSEXUALS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The judge noted that the government made no argument to exclude
homosexuals based on &quot;mental illness,&quot; security or infectious
diseases.  In fact, Justice Department lawyers dismissed these
well-founded arguments as &quot;myths.&quot;  Consider the facts.
<P>
<B>Homosexuals as a category present unacceptable risks.</B>
Research shows that homosexuals tend to be extremely promiscuous
and tend to have high incidences of sexually transmitted diseases,
especially the deadly AIDS virus.
<P>
Admitting homosexuals into the military violates the legal principle
of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that if you
know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain when
the risk materializes.  
<P>
A recent study from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection but that blood tests during this period do
not find the HIV antibodies.[2] This means that the military assumes
some risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that
soldiers are not infected.  This is why screening out high-risk
groups and not just those who test positive for HIV is appropriate.
 Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration no longer screens out
homosexuals -- by far the highest risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
has addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[3]
<P><UL>
<LI>&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
directly from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units
of blood were drawn from soldiers and directly transfused to Somalis.
 The urgency of such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS
virus.]
<P>
<LI>&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot; [The CDC reports that most
of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[4] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[5] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a mainstream homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits that, &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for
being exposed to hepatitis B.[6]
<P>
<LI> &quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.
</UL>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[7] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and more than a third (35%)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that only
one time in four do homosexual men use condoms.[8]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one sex partner, 55 percent have had two to 19 partners,
and 25 percent have had 20 or more partners.[9]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had two to four partners,
17 percent 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent 11 to 20 and 17 percent
report having had 21 or more sex partners.[10] However, that survey
excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of the population
and who typically have had more conservative sex lives.  Thus
the real figures probably are even lower for the population of
all men.[11]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
of induction or have early-stage HIV and not test positive and
be accorded full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This
is about $120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[12]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[13] He warns that this is
in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases and
assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries will
use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year cost
could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[14]
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[15] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and $639,000 by the year 2008.[16]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated, but at that time 1,580
were still on active duty.  Their status precluded them from deploying
overseas and necessitated special assignments and special medical
care.[17]
<P>
Homosexuals also have much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals
as indicated by a study of more than 6,737 obituaries published
in <I>Omega: Journal of Death and Dying</I>.  The average age
of homosexuals who died from AIDS is 39; from all other causes
it is 42.[18]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse represent the second key health
problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (with violence
the third).[19] A report by the National Lesbian-Gay Health Foundation
found that homosexuals -- men and women -- are about three times
as likely as heterosexuals to have an alcohol or drug abuse problem.[20]
<P>
While the 1992 GAO report states that the military spent $26 million
on homosexuals discharged,  it spent many times that figure treating
homosexuals with AIDS -- people who lied to enter the military
and now receive full health and pay benefits.  The cost-effective
decision would be to minimize the risk to the federal taxpayer
by rejecting homosexuals before they are recruited and discharging
those later discovered.
<P>
The 1992 GAO report also found that women are discharged for homosexuality
four times as often as men.  They are much more likely to be processed
under administrative discharge procedures than men.
<P>
Lesbians are also disruptive to unit morale and cohesion.  Pentagon
records include vignettes[21] such as the case of a female sergeant
who drank too much.  She approached four different women at a
base social club making sexually explicit remarks and grabbing
one woman's buttocks.  She was arrested on charges of indecent
assault.
<P>
A female veteran told her account of another female soldier who
made sexual advances in a barracks.  &quot;I was stuck in the
same barracks with that person for three months.  I had to get
up and look at that person every day.  She [the homosexual] insisted
on trying to find a mate in the barracks, and by the end of the
training, everyone has [sic] lost morale.&quot;
<P>
A female basic training soldier complained to her drill sergeant
that other female trainees were &quot;making out&quot; in a common
area.  The sergeant subsequently found seven female soldiers partially
dressed, embracing each other, holding hands, and kissing.  The
seven admitted they were lesbians and said that they were consenting
adults.  They stated they had not engaged in sexual activities,
and their lifestyle had nothing to do with being a good soldier.
<P>
A female air force veteran was assigned a lesbian roommate.  She
made strong sexual advances to the straight airwoman, so much
so that the airwoman left her room and slept on the floor in a
friend's barracks.
<P>
<B>The Justice Department ignored evidence showing that homosexuality
is a pathology.</B>  
<P>
Rather, contrary to long-established military precedence, the
government embraced the concept that homosexuality is normal or
at least of little consequence.  Labeling homosexuality as other
than a pathology is a serious mistake.
<P>
The military's World War II experience provided considerable insight
into human behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally
rewrote the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric
disorders.  Since 1945, the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[22]
<P>
In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.[23] In the more than 40 years
since that time, the APA, under pressure from militant homosexual
groups, has progressively changed the nomenclature so as to remove
the negative connotations implicit in the terms &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
or &quot;pathology.&quot;
<P>
During its annual meetings from 1969 through 1971, the APA was
besieged by activists demanding the recognition of homosexual
behavior as normal.  In 1971, homosexual activists invaded the
annual meeting and denounced psychiatry as &quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[24]
<P>
In 1973, activists challenged the New England Psychiatric Society
to rename the section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot; to &quot;sexual
dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year, APA trustees ruled that homosexuality
would no longer be listed in its official nomenclature of mental
disorders but, rather, would be referred to as &quot;sexual orientation
disturbance.&quot;[25]
<P>
The revision of nomenclature continued when, in 1986, the last
remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic homosexuality,&quot; was removed
from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders.
 This was done over the strong protest of many psychiatrists who
preferred to label homosexuality a long standing disturbance originating
in the early years of life.[26]
<P>
A survey of the American Medical Association membership in 1975
found that 69 percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[27]
 An argument used by those who promote homosexuality is that this
proclivity is inborn and irreversible.  Numerous psychotherapists,
including Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi,
Charles Socarides, and Masters and Johnson have reported significant
success in helping homosexuals to recover, thereby proving it
is a curable pathology.[28]
<P>
Despite considerable evidence of success in gender reparative
therapy, the APA, under pressure from gay activists, voted to
stop recommending efforts to turn unhappy homosexuals into heterosexuals.
 In December 1994, AMA's governing House of Delegates called for
a &quot;nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation by physicians.&quot;[29]
<P>
<B>The government ignored evidence that homosexuals are a security
risk by relying on a debunked government report which suggests
that homosexuals are no more at risk of blackmail than heterosexuals.</B>
<P>
The primary study comes from the Defense Personnel Security Research
and Education Center (PERSEREC), an agency of the Department of
Defense.[30] Although the report contains much sloppy research and
misinformation, it is frequently cited by one of the plaintiffs'
key witnesses in this case, former Assistant Secretary of Defense
Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Few people identify themselves as heterosexual; that identity
is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed, identify themselves, however.
<P>
Landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities:
A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women</I>, found that a significant
number of homosexuals report that &quot;someone has threatened
[them with] exposure of homosexuality in order to get something
of value.&quot;[31]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail were the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition might be justified.
 However, homosexuals should not serve for many reasons, and security
investigations are a valid mechanism for enforcing the law.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE SEES A STATUS V. CONDUCT DICHOTOMY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The legal fiction that an admission of homosexuality is not a
valid presumption of misconduct has long been dismissed by the
courts.  For many years, the military has won homosexual cases
because the courts recognize that people don't label themselves
homosexuals without some experience or intent to engage in the
defining behavior.  The Clinton Administration tried to finesse
this point in court but failed to persuade the judge, who labeled
the government's arguments as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
<P>
Because the government failed to show a connection between a declaration
of homosexuality and misconduct, the judge understandably concluded
&quot;that the admission of homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable
risk that they would commit acts inherently dangerous to morale,
good order, and discipline....&quot;
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE RELIES ON DEBUNKED STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that homosexuals create sexual tension in
single-gender organizations.  This tension undermines morale and
cohesion which are key to military readiness.
<P>
The plaintiffs dismiss this argument by citing a Rand Corporation
study which concludes &quot;although some disruptions might result
from having acknowledged homosexuals serving in the military....the
experience of analogous [non-military] organizations...suggests
that any increase is likely to be quite small.&quot;
<P>
In 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin commissioned the Rand
Corporation to study lifting the military's homosexual ban.  The
Rand study cost $1.3 million and contains inaccurate or misleading
information and inappropriate parallels.
<P><UL>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's report on other countries, &quot;[N]o
serious problems were reported concerning the presence of homosexuals
in the force.&quot;
<P>
Rand ignored the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in
the Military: Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[32]
 The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected four countries for
detailed analysis.  The report states that 11 countries have policies
that do not permit homosexuals to serve in the military, 11 have
policies that do.  Three of the latter 11 countries do not have
any laws, regulations, or policies that address this issue.  An
unpublished Pentagon study conducted in December 1992 found that
some of those countries that permit homosexuals to serve do so
with strict limitations. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The U.S. routinely participates in combat operations, something
the Dutch have not done for 50 years.      
The German armed forces, which are included among those that do
<I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[33] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites the 1992 GAO study on analogous organizations
which &quot;accepted homosexuals into their ranks...[and] have
generally not reported adverse impacts.&quot;
<P>
Rand's &quot;analogous organizations&quot; are fire and police
departments.  Researchers visited six cities and concluded that
homosexuals were integrated through clear and simple policies,
aggressive leadership and adherence to strict standards of conduct.
 The report prescribes the same approach for the military.
<P>
Rand ignores the important lessons from San Francisco Chief of
Police Anthony D. Ribera, who told the HASC on May 7, 1993 that
his department experiences a &quot;significantly higher&quot;
number of AIDS deaths among homosexual officers.  His department
routinely tests for Hepatitis B -- as demanded by the policemen's
union.  And they rely on local hospitals rather than other officers
for emergency blood.
<P>
San Francisco's officers also go home evenings or, as in the Seattle
Fire Department, occupy private cubicles when required to stay
overnight.  Additionally, homosexual officers serve primarily
in homosexual districts and, as in New York City, no one is forced
to pair up with a homosexual.  Chief Ribera concludes, &quot;Our
experience is remotely parallel to the military.&quot;
<P>
Sgt. Edward Striedinger of the Seattle Police Department told
the HASC about female officers who complained about advances from
lesbian officers.  These women refused to file formal complaints,
citing fear of reprisals. 
<P>
The parallels between paramilitary and military organizations
are mostly cosmetic, such as wearing side-arms and uniforms. 
The differences are pronounced but ignored in Rand's briefing.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's study on racial integration of
the services stating, integration &quot;did not 'destroy' unit
cohesion and military effectiveness.&quot;
<P>
Rand equates the evolving &quot;discriminatory&quot; homosexual
policy with the integration of blacks into the military.  General
Colin Powell has rejected the linkage: &quot;Skin color is [a]
benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation is perhaps
the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.  Comparison
of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[34]
<P>
The Council of 100 (a national organization of African-American
Republicans founded in 1974) points out differences in the moral
and social climate in 1948 (when President Truman directed the
military to integrate), and the fact that blacks had honorably
and openly served since the Revolutionary War.  The Council said
that the homosexual discrimination argument is &quot;a disingenuous
strategy to divert attention from the real issues&quot; of readiness
and cohesion.[35]
<P>
The integration of avowed homosexuals brings into the military
services individuals whose behavior violates federal law.  The
integration of black Americans involved no behavioral assumptions.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIFTH AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively.  The judge labels
this unjustified discrimination.
<P>
The government once again failed to present compelling evidence
that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are incompatible with military service.
<P>
Consider the implications of homosexual service for military morale.
<P>
Morale means &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to submit to sexual tension with &quot;...a strong
sense of enthusiasm.&quot;  
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to derive their basic identity from their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated,&quot;
or in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  One group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these aren't
enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct Unbecoming</I>
and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right to Serve</I> provide,
perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to the disruptive nature
of homosexuals in military units.[36]
<P>
The voice of experience indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[37] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[38]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE MAKES NO MORAL DECISION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Judge Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine
the constitutionality of the policy adopted by Congress, not its
morality.&quot;  He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to
think it demeaning and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy
on pretense rather than on truth.&quot;
<P>
The judge suggests that constitutionality and morality may not
agree in this case, but many soldiers think this is clearly a
morality issue.  And requiring soldiers to &quot;tolerate&quot;
homosexuality will lead to recruitment and retention problems.
 The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> survey found that 46 percent of
soldiers said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment
decision and 11 percent would not reenlist because of it.  A February
1993 <I>CNN/Gallup Poll</I> found that, among men who had not
attended college, the prime recruiting population, 74 percent
opposed lifting the ban.  
<P>
The judge's labeling this a &quot;pretense&quot; is based on the
Clinton Administration's decision to stop asking recruits whether
they are homosexual.  Asking the question keeps honest homosexuals
out and sends a clear message that to serve, others must keep
their homosexuality a secret.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
It is expected that the Supreme Court will hear this case by 1997.
 As long as the government permits homosexuals to serve and as
long as the Clinton Administration's implementing directives flout
the law, however, the outcome is in doubt.
<P>
The 104th Congress must take legislative action to stop the evasion
of reality.  The Clinton Administration should be required to
abide by the law and the Justice Department must defend the law
using longstanding and successful arguments.

<TITLE>ACCREDITATION COUNCIL MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING </TITLE>

MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING</H2>

<P>
On February 14, 1995, the 23-member Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new
regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing
in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.
 Individual residents expressing moral or religious objections
would be able to opt out of the abortion training.  However, medical
institutions opposed to abortion, such as Catholic hospitals,
would still be required -- in order to maintain their accredited
status -- to provide their students with abortion training by
arranging for their students to receive such training at another
location.
<P>
The wording of the new requirement is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Experience with induced abortion must be part of residency
education, except for residents with moral or religious objections.
 This education can be provided outside the institution.  Experience
with management of complications of abortion must be provided
to all residents.  If a residency program has a religious, moral
or legal restriction which prohibits the residents from performing
abortions within the institution, the program must ensure that
the residents receive a satisfactory education and experience
managing the complications of abortion.  Furthermore, such residency
programs must have mechanisms which ensure that residents in their
program who do not have a religious or moral objection receive
education and experience in performing abortion at another institution.&quot;[1]
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing
their accreditation.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching
hospitals to receive federal reimbursement for services which
medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must
ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified
as competent in their specialties.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DECLINE IN ABORTION PROVIDERS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Over the last twenty years, the number of medical schools offering
elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In
1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. 
medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either
on a routine (26.3 percent) or optional basis (66.2 percent).
 This contrasts with 1991 figures in which 68.8 percent of medical
schools offered first-trimester abortion training -- 12.4 percent
on a routine basis, 56.4 percent on an optional basis.[2] Second-trimester
abortion training is only slightly less common than first-trimester
training programs (65.4 percent vs. 68.8 percent respectively),
but fewer medical schools routinely offer second-trimester abortion
training (6.7 percent); more provide optional training (58.7 percent).[3]
<P>
About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion
training due to moral and/or legal reasons.  For example, Catholic-affiliated
hospitals -- which make up about 20 percent of all U.S. hospitals
-- do not perform elective abortions because of religious and
moral beliefs.[4] Other hospitals, such as the publicly financed
Truman Medical Center in Missouri, are legally prohibited from
performing abortions because laws in several states -- including
Missouri -- bar the use of taxpayer money to fund abortions.[5]
<P>
In addition to the declining number of medical schools which provide
abortion training, fewer physicians are willing to perform abortions.
 A Columbia University survey found that nearly half of the ob/gyn
chief residents graduating each year have never performed a first-trimester
abortion.[6]
<P>
Overall, the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) reports that the
number of hospitals, clinics, and physicians' offices that provide
abortions -- 2,380 in 1992 -- has been declining at a rate of
about 65 a year.  Most of the decline can be attributed to hospitals;
the number of hospitals providing abortions decreased by 18 percent
between 1988 and 1992.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ENSURING THAT WOMEN HAVE A CHOICE?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Proponents of ACGME's new regulations such as the National Abortion
Federation, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the
Feminist Majority Foundation, the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, and the current leadership of the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) point to the decline
in abortion providers as justification for the mandate.  They
emphasize that unless the procedure is required, many ob/gyn students
will choose to opt out of abortion training, thereby decreasing
access to abortion.
<P>
Abortion advocacy groups hope the ACGME mandate will help bring
abortion back into the &quot;mainstream&quot; of ob/gyn practice.
 Currently, the vast majority of abortions are performed in clinics,
isolating abortion from the general practice of medicine.  Abortionists
also say they frequently feel less respected by their colleagues
and society in general.  By including abortion as a necessary
ob/gyn service, abortion proponents hope to remove the taint associated
with abortion and also reduce the targeting of clinics by abortion
protesters.
<P>
Finally, the ACGME cited patient safety as a reason to require
abortion training.  Dr. John C. Gienapp, Ph.D., executive director
of ACGME, said, &quot;Those physicians who choose to develop appropriate
medical skills in the area of abortion must be trained adequately.&quot;[8]
 The American Medical Association agreed, saying in a statement,
&quot;For the safety of patients, it is essential that physicians
providing abortion services are trained and competent.&quot;[9]
<P>
While the new regulations will not go into effect until January
1, 1996, abortion advocacy groups as well as several medical societies
-- including ACOG -- have lobbied the ACGME for over a year to
adopt such a policy change.[10]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>OR REMOVING CHOICE FROM OB/GYN PHYSICIANS?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new abortion mandate has received considerable opposition
-- from pro-life groups to many within the medical establishment.
 &quot;Pro-choice&quot; physician James Schreiber, M.D., chief
of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University Medical
Center in St. Louis, denounced the new policy as coercive and
&quot;anti-choice,&quot; saying that institutions with moral objections
were &quot;being forced into an untenable position.&quot;[11]
<P>
Richard T. F. Schmidt, M.D., a former ACOG president (1977-1978)
and residency review committee member, also questions the rationale
behind the abortion training mandate.  In a letter to ACGME's
ob/gyn residency review committee, Dr. Schmidt wrote, &quot;Is
there a demonstrated lack of knowledge or technical competence
among program graduates?  Or is the purpose to make more residents
comfortable with the <I>idea</I> of elective abortion and its
performance?&quot;  Commenting on the diminishing number of programs
offering elective abortion training, Dr. Schmidt said that given
a choice, faculty and residents &quot;voted very clearly with
their feet.&quot;[12]
<P>
The Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS), the American
Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, and other pro-life and pro-family
groups have also registered their strong opposition to the new
mandate.  These groups argue that requiring residents to undergo
abortion training will have the effect of dissuading many pro-life
medical students from choosing to specialize in ob/gyn.  These
groups also believe that residents will receive intense pressure
from within the medical school to undergo abortion training due
to the accreditation requirement.[13]
<P>
The fears these groups express may well be justified.  An editorial
published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> indicates
that ob/gyn residents will receive considerable pressure to undergo
elective abortion training.  The author of the editorial, an advocate
of the new ACGME requirements, writes that &quot;[r]esidents who
wish to opt out of abortion training should be required to explain
why in a way that satisfies <I>stringent</I> and <I>explicit</I>
criteria&quot; (emphasis added).[14]  Furthermore, two years ago the
University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill
found that greater numbers of residents were refusing to perform
abortions even though the school provided training.  As a result,
the school sent a letter to all prospective residents in the summer
of 1993 saying that it would accept only candidates who agreed
to perform abortions.  The policy was rescinded after threats
of a class-action lawsuit.[15]
<P>
The North Carolina scenario demonstrates that ACGME's new policies
were not passed in response to ob/gyn residents who wanted to
receive abortion training but were unable to receive it.  Such
a conclusion is also supported by a recently released survey by
the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a
recognized special interest group within the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).  With almost 25 percent
of the 36,000 ACOG members responding, the survey found that 59
percent of respondents felt that abortion training should <U>not</U>
be required in residency programs.[16]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IMPACTS OF THE ABORTION TRAINING MANDATE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new requirements seem to be implicitly directed at teaching
residents to perform second- and third-trimester abortions.  As
Congressman and family physician/obstetrician Tom Coburn (R-OK)
has testified, medical residents already receive training in handling
spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) through dilation and curettage
(D &amp; C), which is the usual technique used for first-trimester
abortions.  Only later-term abortions require additional training
in special techniques to &quot;terminate the pregnancy.&quot;[17]
<P>
The new policy would also require teaching hospitals to provide
or obtain additional facilities, equipment, and faculty (or contract
with other institutions to do so).  Furthermore, hospitals which
have not historically referred patients for abortions because
of moral reasons and which refuse to provide abortion training
on-site would nonetheless be forced to violate their fundamental
beliefs and directly collaborate with abortion providers.  The
mandate also violates laws in roughly half the states that exempt
hospitals from referring for abortion, contraception, or sterilization
when the hospital is conscientiously opposed.
<P>
Because the abortion training mandate does conflict with several
states' laws, it can also be reasonably expected that Planned
Parenthood and other abortion providers will file lawsuits to
change the laws which (1) exempt hospitals from referring for
abortion, and (2) explicitly ban the use of taxpayer monies to
fund abortions in publicly-funded hospitals.

<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The forced feminization of the Navy is undermining combat readiness
and Congress must exercise its Constitutional responsibility to
examine these politically motivated changes before more damage
is done.
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry promised, &quot;Our over-arching
goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.
 By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women
can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility
in the development and use of human resources.&quot;[1] 
<P>
Unfortunately, Mr. Perry has set a course to feminize the Navy
without regard for military necessity.  Today, 94 percent of Navy
billets, including previously exempt combat positions, are open
to women.  Secretary Perry promotes these changes as &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot;[2]
<P>
Consider factors that seriously impair Navy readiness.
<P><UL>
<LI>A Navy study found that women are NOT physically equipped to
perform most at-sea emergency tasks.
<P>
<LI>A 1995 Navy policy embraces pregnancy as an acceptable readiness
problem in spite of the fact that almost half of pregnant sailors
never return to their crews after delivery.
<P>
<LI>Fraternization is a growing problem among crew members aboard
mixed-gender ships and this contributes to serious morale and
cohesion problems at sea.  It also has a negative effect on the
well-being of military spouses back home.
<P>
<LI>The Navy has ignored longstanding screening standards in order
to accelerate less qualified women into positions, thus bypassing
more experienced men.
<P>
<LI>Sexual harassment charges are a favorite tool of some women
who manipulate Navy leaders to promote personal agendas.
<P>
<LI>The Defense Department has promised to raise the percentage
of female servicemembers to perhaps 25 percent of the total force.[3]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>STUDY SAYS WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy has ignored key findings which demonstrate that women
are less equipped physically to perform assignments aboard combat ships.
 The Navy Personnel Research and Development Center in San Diego,
California, conducted a comprehensive study of 350 men and 195
women to determine what effect training had on their physical
performances.  The study measured performance on five basic damage
control tasks: carrying litters on level surfaces and up and down
ladders, moving and starting emergency pumps, turning engine bolts,
and directing fire hose streams.  Virtually all male recruits
were able to perform all of the tasks before training, while women
could perform only one of the tasks to a satisfactory standard.[4]
<P>
Even after significant training, women showed no appreciable improvement.
 The study found that the differences between the sexes on measures
of lifting strength and aerobic capacity are dramatic.  
<P>
All naval crewmembers must be prepared to perform damage control
assignments.  Lack of physical strength among female sailors can
decrease survivability.  For example, had more women been aboard
the <I>USS Stark</I>, crippled by an Iraqi missile in the Persian
Gulf, the loss of life and property would very likely have been
greater.
<P>
Analogous organization experiences show similar trends.  Civilian
fire departments have reported disproportionate differences between
the sexes in injury rates when women are expected to perform like
men.  They suffer up to three times as many disabling back injuries
as men.[5] Women suffer more injuries because to lift the same load
as men, they must operate near their maximum lifting capacity,
e.g., a male medic carrying a litter uses on the average half
of his lifting power, but a woman uses on average her full lifting
capacity.
<P>
The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in
the Armed Forces found that women's aerobic capacity is significantly
lower, meaning they cannot carry as much as far as fast as men.
 Despite the existence of an exceedingly small number of Amazonian
women who resemble men in muscular mass, on average, women are
shorter, have less muscle mass and weigh less than men.  This
puts them at a distinct disadvantage when performing tasks requiring
a high level of muscular strength and aerobic capacity.[6]
<P>
The Commission also found that women are at a higher risk for
exercise-induced injuries than men, with 2.13 times greater risk
for lower extremity injuries, and 4.71 times greater risk for
stress fractures.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PREGNANCY POLICY HURTS READINESS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy's 1995 pregnancy policy ignores readiness while favoring
protection of individuals' rights.  As the number of women in
the Navy increases, pregnancy becomes a serious readiness issue.
<P>
At any given time, up to 18 percent of Navy women are pregnant
and a study of two ships showed a pregnancy rate as high as one
in three.[8] That's nearly 8,423 women or enough to crew almost
two aircraft carriers.  During Desert Storm 1,145 women on ships
needed to be reassigned because of pregnancies, at an average
of 95 per month.[9]
<P>
According to the policy, a woman may serve aboard ship until she
is 20 weeks pregnant.  While aboard ship, she must never be more
than six hours from emergency OB/GYN care.  Perhaps this provision
exists because at least five babies have been born on Navy ships,
one of which died shortly after birth.  Obviously, this policy
limits the pregnant sailor's deployability and her job performance
is frequently limited.
<P>
On average, each pregnancy taken to term removes a female sailor
from her ship for at least six months.  Once the child is born,
the sailor receives six weeks of convalescent leave and is not
required to re-deploy for four months.  That period can be extended
by the attending physician.  Many women never return to their
ship after giving birth.  According to Navy records, 35 percent
leave the Navy and eight percent remain on shore.    
<P>
Those who do return are unable to devote full time to their infant,
often creating an unhealthy reliance on child care at an extremely
impressionable age for the child.  Extended care for children
during frequent deployments denies the child the nurturing that
is key to a balanced emotional composition.   
<P>
According to Jay Belsky writing in the <I>Journal of Marriage
and the Family</I>, children left in child care while mothers
work &quot;scored more poorly on a composite measure of adjustment
than did children whose mothers were not employed during their
first three years....[and they] were significantly more noncompliant
than agemates without such early experience.&quot;[10]  These problems
are made worse as the mother-child separations are longer and
more frequent.
<P>
According to the Defense Manpower Data Center, two thirds of all
uniformed female mothers of one child have never married.  There
are never-married servicemembers with as many as nine dependents.
 Today, there are 84,831 never-married female active duty members
from all services with at least one child.[11]
<P>
Unmarried female servicemembers with at-home dependents are eligible
for benefits identical to married members.  For example, they
receive larger government quarters (more children means more bedrooms),
larger allowances driven by family size (such as cost of living
allowances), government-subsidized child care and medical care.
 During each pregnancy the servicemember is provided all pay and
allowances, time off and free medical benefits.
<P>
If a pregnant sailor wants an abortion she must be transported
off the ship to a location near an abortion clinic.  Before this
happens Navy personnel must counsel her about her options.  If
she chooses abortion, she is given, at government expense, a complete
blood count (CBC) to determine whether to administer Rhogam to
prevent an immune reaction.  After the abortion, the Navy provides
medical attention for problems arising from the procedure, like
clinical depression or an incomplete abortion.  The costs for
this treatment are borne by the Navy.
<P>
Navy policy prohibits supervisors from taking action against a
woman who becomes pregnant during a deployment, and there is no
requirement for women to use birth control during deployments.
 One command did, however, send a message to all ship captains
directing them to counsel their female sailors about the advantages
of NORPLANT, the under-the-skin birth control device.[12] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SEX TAKES PLACE AFLOAT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Two sailors aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> were recently punished
for having sex, videotaping the event and then showing it to fellow
sailors.  The sailors were charged with adultery, since each of
them was married to someone else.  The incident shows that mixing
men and women in close quarters for extended periods can lead
to misconduct, and it has serious implications for morale.
<P>
The number of pregnancies aboard the USS Eisenhower, the first
combat vessel with female crewmembers, grew from five to 39 in
a couple months.  In all, 13 percent of the female crew became
pregnant.  By comparison, less than four percent of the male crewmembers
left the <I>Eisenhower</I> for medical reasons since April 1994.[13]
<P>
An active duty Naval officer with recent at-sea experience supervising
female sailors claims that every ship has &quot;large numbers
of pregnancies.&quot;  This officer alleges that advancement in
the Navy depends on supporting the &quot;vital program of women
at sea&quot; and he is &quot;not sure the Navy [has] thought through
the pregnancy issue.&quot;[14]
<P>
A seasoned chief petty officer who recently supervised women aboard
ship alleges that many women &quot;get pregnant to avoid deployment.&quot;
 He believes that many &quot;Generation X&quot; women are in the
Navy for financial gain, the education and to find a husband.
 Sex aboard ship is common.  As a supervisor who wouldn't tolerate
sexual liaisons among crewmembers,  he claims that his disapproving
female subordinates were very uncooperative with him due to his
lack of tolerance of their fraternization.
<P>
The chief alleges that many of his female subordinates were untrained
prior to a recent deployment because they had only been recently
reassigned to the crew.  They were replacing other females who
&quot;got pregnant at the last minute.&quot;  It is difficult
to replace women with men, because ships are now configured to
accommodate a specified number of billets for each sex. 
<P>
Apart from the immediate shipboard impact, the policy hurts family
members who stay ashore and worry about the sexual climate to
which their spouses are being subjected.  An officer's wife recently
wrote about sexual tensions in Haiti.  Two men shared a tent with
a female officer who &quot;made it known that she was open to
intimate relationships.&quot;  The male officer indicated the
situation made him &quot;uncomfortable and awkward&quot; and it
&quot;was to him professionally and personally&quot; distressing.
 He had recently married and his wife was pregnant with their
first child.[15] Military wives often worry about the prospects that
their husbands might be sexually preyed upon by women willing
to use sex for personal gain.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION COMES ABOARD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
There is growing anecdotal evidence that shows that female sailors
get special treatment.  Consider several incidents.
<P>
A female sailor aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> was disciplined
for &quot;falling in love.&quot;  Her punishment was three days
on bread and water in a Navy brig.  Since the carrier has no female
jail, she was sent ashore to Rota, Spain via an Italian island,
Italy, Germany and finally Spain.  En route to Rota, she and her
two escorts shopped and dined their way for five days, all at
government expense.  She told the <I>Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and
Ledger-Star</I>, &quot;I was free to go.  We went out to eat,
to the shopping malls in Italy and we stayed in hotels.  It had
to be a huge expense.&quot;[16] Some &quot;punishment.&quot;
<P>
The 19-year-old claims she was the only female crewmember disciplined
for breaking the captain's no-dating policy and alleges other
women were found &quot;with their boyfriends kissing in closets
and other hideaways aboard ship.&quot;[17]
<P>
Tragedies which involve Navy women have also been handled in an
unusual fashion.  The fatal crash of an F-14A Tomcat fighter on
October 25, 1994 is revealing.  In an unprecedented move, the
Navy released Lieutenant Kara S. Hultgreen's training records
to the media and her mother, Sally Spears.  It also went to great
lengths to recover the aircraft from the ocean floor.  Finally,
it released a video showing Hultgreen's last carrier approach.
<P>
Although initial reports blamed a failed engine for the crash,
on March 14, 1995, the Mishap Investigation Report (MIR) contained
&quot;...repeated instances of pilot error.  It notes the role
of engine trouble but concludes that Hultgreen's flight-control
mistakes were the most critical factors [in the accident].&quot;[18]
 The MIR, written to exacting standards, is classified as &quot;privileged&quot;
and is used for improving the safety of future flights.
<P>
On March 7, 1995 a female Navy pilot called a live national radio
show from the deck of the <I>USS Abraham Lincoln</I>, the same
carrier to which Hultgreen was assigned.  This F-18 pilot called
to promote women in combat aircraft.  She explained that the &quot;women
in the military&quot; debate is about &quot;equal opportunity&quot;
and as far as she is concerned there is &quot;no problem.&quot;[19]
<P>
In August 1994, a male Navy pilot told his boss that he objected
to women serving in combat, but would follow orders.  He now faces
dismissal for failing to &quot;demonstrate leadership&quot; despite
having received outstanding efficiency reports.[20]
<P>
Another male officer alleges that women are receiving preferential
treatment for command and promotions.  One female officer was
selected to become a ship's executive officer after only three
years of sea duty.  The more seasoned male officer explained that
the standard has long been no less than six to eight years of
sea duty before eligibility for this coveted assignment.  He also
cited the example of a female commander who was excused for hitting
a sea buoy, an act which is normally a career killer.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CHARGES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 1991 Tailhook convention branded the Navy as a haven of sexual
harassers.  Even though much of the evidence is contradictory,
the Navy has suffered serious public relations damage.
<P>
In the wake of Tailhook, several key senior Navy leaders have
taken direct hits from women alleging sexual harassment.  Admiral
Stanley Arthur decided to drop a female lieutenant with poor flying
skills from helicopter aviation training.  The lieutenant claimed
that she had been eliminated from flight school because of &quot;retaliation&quot;
for filing a successful sexual harassment complaint.  The man
involved in the harassment charge was punished for making inappropriate
comments and has since left the Navy.
<P>
Adm. Arthur reviewed the lieutenant's record and found evidence
of poor aptitude and performance both before and after the harassment
incident.  He wrote: &quot;From this review I do not have sufficient
confidence that [the lieutenant] could safely and successfully
operate an aircraft in a dangerous and unforgiving operational
environment....I do not desire to see her or perhaps others die
because she could not perform at a level consistent with our standards.&quot;[21]
<P>
The admiral had been nominated to become Commander in Chief of
Naval Forces in the Pacific (CINCPAC).  After his decision, his
confirmation was procedurally shelved possibly because of threats
from congresswomen like Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-CO) who fought
the retirement status of outgoing Chief of Naval Operations Frank
B. Kelso II, who oversaw the Tailhook investigation.  The Navy
withdrew the Arthur nomination.
<P>
Tragically, Coast Guard Captain Ernest J. Blanchard IV took his
own life after learning of an investigation into remarks he allegedly
made at a dinner at the Coast Guard Academy on January 10, 1995.
 An officer who attended the dinner said, &quot;I heard the remark
that some of the things the speaker said would have been OK maybe
20 years ago....I guess they were jokes, off-color remarks, not
politically correct.  Some women in the humanities department
apparently complained about the comments.&quot;[22]
<P>
Blanchard, considered a rising star in the Coast Guard, wrote
a formal letter of apology to the &quot;offended&quot; woman,
but it was not accepted.  The female officer pressed her allegations.
 Blanchard offered to retire but permission was denied.  Friends
believe that he felt that his character was being assailed and
that he was being treated as an example by the Coast Guard.
<P>
In other instances, remarks by junior officers have met with charges
of sexual harassment.  For example, when a petty officer reported
that two of his subordinates were having a lesbian relationship,
the women responded by alleging sexual harassment.  The senior
chief was removed from the ship.
<P>
Another officer was removed for being a &quot;gender offender.&quot;
 The first words out of his boss's mouth were: &quot;You're guilty
of sexual harassment,&quot; a clear violation of the long tradition
of being held innocent until proven guilty.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's decision to scuttle exemptions for
women and to embrace the feminization of the Navy has seriously
damaged readiness.  The 104th Congress should reverse the current
trend before irreparable harm is done to the U.S. Navy and the
defense posture of the nation.

<TITLE>THE FACTS ABOUT WELFARE AND ABORTION IN NEW JERSEY</TITLE>

WELFARE AND ABORTION<BR>
IN NEW JERSEY</H2>

<P>
<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
John Cardinal O'Connor of New York has defined two conditions
-- and two conditions only -- that justify opposing the anti-illegitimacy
measures recently adopted by the House.  His opposition hinges,
first, on the &quot;virtual inevitability&quot; that a freeze
on benefits &quot;amounts to a programmed 'short-term' increase
in abortions&quot; and, second, on the lack of &quot;any hard
evidence&quot; to support the contention that reducing illegitimacy
will reduce abortions.[1]
<P>
The Cardinal's principled objections deserve an answer, and all
people of faith should be relieved by the fact that we do have
hard evidence to allay both of his concerns.  Given the weight
of evidence suggesting that abortions will not increase in the
short term and will in fact decrease in the long term, those who
defend the status quo on moral or empirical grounds must now bear
the burden of proof.  And those who have been both puzzled and
troubled by the rift in the pro-life ranks over this issue must
understand that the division springs not from a different understanding
of our moral responsibilities, but from a different degree of
reliance on the actual empirical record.
<P>
While it is far too premature to draw any decisive conclusions
from the welfare experiment in New Jersey, there is absolutely
no statistical indication as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the state's family cap took effect August 1,
1993.  In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions
in New Jersey declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[2]
<P>
Because Medicaid data is collected by date of payment, rather
than procurement, the raw numbers do contain some distortion.
 Yet any Medicaid-funded abortion occurring within approximately
the first year after implementation of the cap is included in
the current data set.  While the 1994 numbers are still subject
to some adjustment to reflect the most recent abortions for which
no claim has yet been filed, the existing margin between the totals
for 1993 and 1994 can accommodate the anticipated inflation without
threatening the indication that abortions have not surged upward
as feared.
<P>
Likewise, the number of privately funded abortions performed on
welfare mothers
 is expected to be too negligible to affect the finding that abortions
have not significantly increased (especially since the average
cost of an abortion in New Jersey in 1993 was equal to eight times
the $64 amount by which the new policy reduces the benefits package
each month).  Although no hard data is available to address the
question, Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute commented
that &quot;it logically does not make sense to suggest that women
who are in severe financial straits and are eligible for a publicly
funded abortion would forgo those Medicaid dollars in lieu of
scarce private resources.&quot;  No data is available, she noted,
precisely because the possibility that welfare women forgo available
public funding for the abortions they choose to have is too remote
to merit the expenditure of research dollars.[3] 
<P>
The only other significant objection to the use of Medicaid data
-- the only data we have at present -- is that the population
includes approximately 57,000 women (ages 16-45) who are eligible
for Medicaid, but are not subject to the Family Development Program
(FDP) in New Jersey that included the family cap.  The presence
of such a sizeable group of women who are not subject to the new
welfare policy could conceivably mask an increase in abortions;
but the fact that the non-FDP population remained virtually unchanged
between 1993 and 1994 suggests that there is no hidden increase
lurking in the short-run data.
<P>
Anita Leone, executive director of an association that represents
all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey, confirmed
in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in New Jersey
are currently decreasing.  We just don't know why.&quot;  Since
the decline in the birth rate among welfare mothers in New Jersey
has been rather substantial since implementation of the family
cap (estimates range at least as high as 11.4 percent[4]), the fact
that an increase in abortions is not yet indicated is significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the frontlines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds not to
terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
 One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[5]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[6] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[7]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrates that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;[8]
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[9]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
Contrary to Cardinal O'Connor's assertion, we do have compelling
statistical evidence to suggest that reducing illegitimacy will
reduce abortions.  Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has
found an astronomically high correlation between abortion and
illegitimacy in a state-by-state analysis.  His study shows that
an increase of 100 in the number of illegitimate births per 10,000
women, in fact, results in an increase of 200 in the number of
abortions per 10,000 women.[10]
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.  Marriage affords the
best protection -- indeed, the only real hope -- for the children
of the poor.
<P>
In deference to that fact, John Paul II wrote in his most recent
encyclical <I>Evangelium Vitae</I> that &quot;[a] general <I>and
no less serious </I>responsibility [for abortion] lies with those
who have encouraged the spread of an attitude of sexual permissiveness
and a lack of esteem for motherhood, and with those who should
have ensured -- but did not -- effective family and social policies
in support of families.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Pope's teaching leaves ample room for inferring that a program
that undermines families and promotes sexual immorality as effectively
as our current welfare system does is equally responsible for
abortion as permissive abortion laws.  Those who countenance the
status quo in welfare countenance a system rife with abortion.
 And those who fight for welfare reform wage a war against abortion
that is no less morally valid than peaceful sit-ins, prayer vigils,
and reform of law.

<TITLE>THE EVELYN HOOKER STUDY AND THE NORMALIZATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY</TITLE>

<H2>THE EVELYN HOOKER STUDY<BR>

<P>
Evelyn Hooker has been among the most influential figures in the
highly successful movement to convince the American people that
homosexuality is a &quot;normal variant&quot; of human sexual
behavior.  Her 1957 study, &quot;The Adjustment of the Male Overt
Homosexual&quot; (<I>Journal of Projective Techniques,</I> 1957,
21, 18-31) is the most frequently cited scientific source for
the argument that homosexuality is not a pathology, that homosexuals
are as free from mental disorder as heterosexuals.  
<P>
Such assertions have not only found their way into standard psychology
textbooks but have also provided a scientific basis for decisions
in major court cases involving the legality of state sodomy laws
and prohibitions against homosexual employment in certain state
and local agencies (e.g., schools, police departments).  Indeed,
when the American Psychiatric Association debated the issue of
homosexuality in 1973, Evelyn Hooker's work was Exhibit A for
those who wanted to remove homosexuality from the group's list
of mental disorders. 
<P>
For many commentators and activists, the Hooker study effectively
ended the debate over whether or not homosexuals were in any way
abnormal in their relationships with each other and with the community
at large.  Today many Americans have accepted the idea that homosexuality
is &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; without realizing
that such an opinion is derived in large measure from a single
study -- one conducted by a UCLA professor whose previous laboratory
subjects had been rats.  
<P>
In all this extravagant homage to Hooker and her study, several
points have escaped her admirers, to say nothing of the federal
courts: 
<P>
1. In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample
to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists
to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis
that homosexuality is not a pathology.  Individuals who proved
unstable were deleted from the final sample.
<P>
2. Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual
subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.
<P>
3. Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged
in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.
<P>
4. Hooker made several errors in her mathematical calculations
that raise doubts about her care and competence as a researcher.
<P>
5. Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal
in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals
as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.
<P>
6. Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach
test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration
and evaluation of the Rorschach.
<P>
7. On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story
test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives
about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from
including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts.  For
that reason, Hooker altered the nature of the study by no longer
asking the judges to use the TAT and MAPS in an attempt to determine
the sexual orientation of each of the 60 subjects, since the differences
were apparent from the narratives.
<P>
In order to understand fully the nature of the controversy over
Hooker's study, it is helpful to review its history.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE HISTORY OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Evelyn Hooker did not begin her research on homosexuals as a logical
development in her career as a psychologist or even out of a dispassionate
scientific curiosity. From all indications, she undertook the
study to prove that homosexuals could function as normal human
beings.  As she herself said, &quot;How could my hypothesis have
been anything else?  I'd seen these men and saw nothing psychopathological
in their behavior.&quot;[1]
<P>
&quot;These men&quot; were the many friends she'd made in the
Los Angeles homosexual community -- one of whom, Sam From, persuaded
her to undertake the investigation.  &quot;Now we have let you
see us as we are,&quot; he said to the UCLA professor.  &quot;It
is your scientific duty to do a study of people like us.&quot;[2]
 Despite the fact that she was a &quot;rat runner&quot; -- with
no clinical experience in the area of human behavior, she undertook
her study, which would become, along with the Kinsey report, a
prime weapon in the hands of the gay rights movement.
<P>
It is important to examine carefully the manner in which Hooker
planned and executed her research, which was funded by the federal
government's National Institute of Mental Health.  A number of
commentators have failed to read Hooker's own report carefully
or else have deliberately distorted her methods and findings for
their own purposes.  Here is just how she proceeded and what she
found.         
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SELECTION OF SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
First, to find her homosexual subjects, she enlisted the early
gay rights group Mattachine Society, which, as she put it in her
published report, &quot;has as its stated purpose the development
of a homosexual ethic....&quot;[3] Members of the Mattachine Society
volunteered for the study and also recruited their friends.  Hooker,
herself, created a &quot;control group&quot; of heterosexuals
for the experiment, despite the fact that on the standardized
tests she intended to use, norms had already been established.
<P>
In her 1957 report, Hooker offers this somewhat cryptic explanation
of heterosexual recruitment:
<P>
Because the heterosexuals were, for the most part, obtained from
community organizations which must remain anonymous, I cannot
describe further the way in which they were obtained.[4]
<P>
Years later, a <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter elicited from
Hooker a somewhat different explanation, one that is fairly explicit
in detail:
<P>
She canvassed the education secretaries of labor unions, thinking
that they would have liberal attitudes.  &quot;I was wrong,&quot;
she says; as soon as she explained the nature of the study, no
one wanted to participate...So Hooker took to collaring candidates
wherever she could find them, including a fireman who showed up
to inspect her home.  &quot;No man is safe on Saltair Street,&quot;
joked her husband.[5] 
<P>
She did not insist on a random sampling.  In fact, she deliberately
sought out only those subjects who seemed stable and &quot;normal&quot;
-- at least in their ability to adjust to their social environment.
 She defined the criteria for membership in the groups as follows:
<P>
In both groups subjects were eliminated who were in therapy at
the time.  If, in the preliminary screening, evidence of considerable
disturbance appeared, the individual was eliminated (5 heterosexuals;
5 homosexuals).[6]
<P>
As for the sexual proclivities of the participants, Hooker says
the following in her report:
<P>
I attempted to secure homosexuals who would be pure for homosexuality;
that is, without heterosexual experience.  With three exceptions
this is so.  These three subjects had not had more than three
heterosexual experiences, and they identified themselves as homosexual
in their patterns of desire and behavior.  The heterosexual group
is exclusively heterosexual beyond the adolescent period, with
three exceptions; these three had had a single homosexual experience
each.[7]
<P>
Originally, she chose 40 homosexual subjects and matched them
as closely as possible by age, IQ, and education with 40 heterosexual
subjects.  At some point, as noted parenthetically above, she
found five from each group too unbalanced to include in her study,
so apparently she dropped these ten and their matches in the opposite
groups -- for a total of 20 eliminated.  This winnowing process
reduced the size of the total pool from 80 to 60.
<P>
It is instructive to read her summary of these matchings and then
compare that summary to the chart containing the same information.
<P>
The homosexuals, and thus the heterosexuals, ranged in age from
25 to 50, with an average age of 34.5 for the homosexual group
and 36.6 for the heterosexual group.  The IQ range, as measured
by the Otis Self-Administering Tests of Mental Ability, was from
90 to 135, with an average for the homosexual group of 115.4 and
for the heterosexual group of 116.2.  In education the range was
from completion of grammar school to the equivalent of a master's
degree, with an average for the homosexual group of 13.9 years
and for the heterosexual group of 14.3.[8]
<P>
Turning to the table upon which she lists the age, IQ scores,
and education of all 60 subjects, a careful reader finds that
the figures neatly arranged in columns <I>contradict her summary</I>.
 While she says the age range for all subjects is 25-50, the chart
indicates that the youngest subject is 26 and the oldest 57. 
The figures on the table indicate an average age of 35 for the
homosexuals and 37 for the heterosexuals -- different averages
than the ones Hooker gives.
<P>
In her summary, she says the range of IQ scores is 90-135, but
the lowest IQ score on her chart is 91.  Despite this error, however,
her averages for both homosexuals and heterosexuals are consistent
with the chart.
<P>
On average years of education, she gives as a range the completion
of grammar school to the equivalent of a masters degree.  Here
her summary is at best imprecise, since the least amount of education
is 9 years -- past the junior high level and three years beyond
elementary school.  The highest educational level indicated on
the chart is 18 years, which is a year beyond the course requirement
for most master's programs.  Also, her average education for homosexuals,
based on the chart, should be 14.0 rather than 13.9.
<P>
These mathematical discrepancies are minor but disturbing.  If
all the averages had been incorrect, a generous reader might have
concluded that somehow she had printed the wrong chart -- a single
careless error.  But given the accuracy of <I>some</I> of her
calculations, it seems more likely she made several careless errors.
 A footnote on the first page of the Hooker report suggests that
the materials were rushed into print -- that, though she hesitated
to publish her paper, &quot;[i]n view of the importance of her
findings it seemed desirable to the editors that they be made
public....&quot;[9]  (In other words, she was saying something that
well-placed members of the profession wanted to hear.)      
<P>
To be sure, these figures are largely irrelevant to the final
conclusions of her study.  The averages of ages, IQ scores, and
amount of education lend only marginal credibility to the selection
process.  Yet the inaccuracies tell us something important about
Hooker's reliability as a researcher, the degree to which we can
trust her methodology.  As noted below, Hooker scored the Rorschach
test herself, despite the fact that she had had little previous
experience in this area.  Add to this inexperience a lack of mathematical
precision, and the study begins to pose genuine problems. 
<P>
At this point, two observations are in order concerning Hooker's
overall method of selecting her subjects.  First, in choosing
a small sample that is anything but random, Hooker has declined
to test the proposition that homosexuals and heterosexuals in
society are equally likely to be normal, well-adjusted human beings.
 As she, herself, says in the report, she is only interested in
&quot;whether homosexuality is <I>necessarily</I> [emphasis added]
a symptom of pathology.&quot;  To answer that question, she maintains,
&quot;All we need is a single case in which the answer is negative.&quot;[10]
 In other words, in this study she is concerned with finding at
least one homosexual who, after testing, doesn't fall into the
category of &quot;pathological.&quot;  This is why she has focused
on the healthiest possible cohort.    
<P>
But the limited scope of her study cuts two ways.  Knowing the
nature of the sample, no one could reasonably conclude from her
findings that homosexuals as a group are no more likely to be
mentally disturbed than heterosexuals.  Yet this is precisely
what many have concluded.  If one accepts the study as valid and
definitive, one can only conclude that some homosexuals are not
pathological <I>in their dealings with the world at large.</I>
  As Hooker herself observes, there is no evidence to conclude
that homosexuals are not pathological in their sexual activities.
<P>
A second point to note about Hooker's selection process is her
ease in recruiting homosexual subjects and her difficulty in recruiting
heterosexual subjects.  Indeed, her account in the study report
is evasive; and her later recollections suggest that she may have
shaded the truth initially in order to cover up problems she encountered
in recruiting the control group.         
<P>
This question becomes more pressing when one reads that in her
group of 30 heterosexual men, she still must include three who
have had homosexual experiences <I>in their adult lives</I> --
by no means a &quot;pure&quot; sample -- and we don't know how
many more had had homosexual experiences in adolescence.  No one
-- not even Kinsey -- would call this an unambiguously heterosexual
group.
<P>
From Hooker's own report -- and from a follow-up interview in
later years -- we see that homosexuals were not only eager to
participate, but indeed were the instigators of the study.  They
hoped that it would prove they were &quot;normal&quot; human beings;
so they scoured their own community to find just the right volunteers
to prove her limited hypothesis.  When analyzing the results of
the Hooker study, it's very important to remember who instigated
the project and the fact that the subjects were well aware of
its ultimate goal.  (In light of this fact, the performance of
homosexuals on two of the three tests, as discussed below, may
well indicate that homosexuality generates social behavior that
is obsessive, indeed all but uncontrollable -- certainly one indication
of pathology.) 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE TESTING OF THE SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
To prove her thesis, Hooker administered three standardized tests
to her 60 subjects -- the Rorschach Test, the Thematic Apperception
Test (TAT), and the Make-A-Picture-Story test (MAPS).  The Rorschach
test, as most people know, consists of a series of ink blots that
subjects are asked to interpret.  The Thematic Apperception Test
requires subjects to describe and make up stories about pictures
of people in various settings.  The MAPS test requires subjects
to arrange cut-out pictures and then make up a story about their
arrangement.   
<P>
Despite her lack of clinical experience in what is called &quot;projective
techniques,&quot; according to Hooker, she administered and scored
the Rorschach test herself.  After scoring the test and constructing
profiles, she placed the results in random order and passed them
along to two experts in Rorschach analysis.  Thus we have Hooker's
scored results analyzed by Drs. Klopfer and Meyer, with two tasks
in mind: first, to rate the subjects on &quot;overall adjustment&quot;
and second, to see if they could determine which were the homosexuals
and which were the heterosexuals.
<P>
On the task of determining overall adjustment (i.e., social stability),
the judges differed sharply in some respects but agreed in others.
 For example, Judge &quot;A&quot; rated 15 of the 60 as &quot;top&quot;
in stability, while Judge &quot;B&quot; rated only 4 as &quot;top.&quot;
 The other ratings revealed greater agreement. However, more homosexuals
than heterosexuals ranked in the two &quot;top&quot; groupings
and more heterosexuals than homosexuals ranked in the two &quot;bottom&quot;
groupings.
<P>
When assigned the task of choosing between the homosexual and
heterosexual subjects, Judge &quot;A&quot; correctly identified
17 of the 30 pairs and Judge &quot;B&quot; 18 of the 30.  An ideal
random selection would have identified 15 out of 30, though Hooker
is technically correct in saying that, in such a small sample,
the results indicate that &quot;neither judge was able to do better
than chance.&quot;[11]
<P>
Critics of Hooker's Rorschach results make at least two points.
 First, they question her ability to administer and score the
test.  As an animal researcher until the time she undertook this
project, she obviously had logged comparatively little experience
in administering Rorschachs, a delicate and highly complicated
task in which the clinician gently and obliquely elicits spontaneous
responses.  Some authorities in the field maintain that, under
ideal circumstances, a more qualified expert would have explored
many avenues Hooker failed to note and would have found out many
things Hooker missed -- including indications of the pathology
of the homosexuals.
<P>
A second criticism of her methodology is the lack of &quot;blindness&quot;
in the administration of the Rorschach.  Ideally, given the nature
of the results sought, the test should have been administered
under circumstances in which both interviewer and subject were
unaware of the purpose of the test.  In the case of the Hooker
study, both she and her subjects knew what she was striving to
prove -- and both she and the homosexuals had a vested interest
in proving the hypothesis that homosexuals were not necessarily
pathological.
<P>
Can Rorschach subjects tailor their answers to desired ends? 
Absolutely, say some Rorschach experts.  One example of such a
phenomenon in &quot;projective techniques&quot; is called the
&quot;Rosenthal Effect,&quot; in which a subject generates the
results he or she believes the researcher wants.  In this particular
case, both the researcher (Hooker) and her homosexual subjects
had a compelling reason to produce these results.
<P>
Perhaps the most significant implications of Hooker's study came
from the MAPS and TAT results, which were analyzed by a single
judge.  Here is Hooker's own account:
<P>
The problem of identifying the homosexual protocol from this
material was essentially a much easier one than that encountered
with the Rorschach, since few homosexuals failed to give open
[sic] homosexual stories on at least one picture.  The second
task given the Rorschach judges, of distinguishing the homosexual
from the heterosexual records when they were presented in matched
pairs, was therefore omitted.[12]
<P>
Note that the identity of the homosexuals was so obvious in these
tests that Hooker did not even ask the judge to distinguish between
homosexual and heterosexual.  Simply put, the homosexuals gave
themselves away on tests less dependent than the Rorschach on
the training and experience of the examiner.  Despite the fact
that they knew the purpose of this test was to prove their own
stability, normalcy, and lack of differentiation from heterosexuals,
they still did not refrain from indulging themselves in homosexual
fantasies, thereby exposing their sexual appetites.  It is difficult
not to conclude that in verbalizing such fantasies, they were
exhibiting the obsessive nature of homosexuality, the difficulty
of homosexuals to control their desire, even when their reputation
in the psychiatric community was at stake.
<P>
As one research analyst puts it:
<P>
So Hooker's study suggests that sexual fantasies among homosexuals
are irrepressible, so much so that such people cannot always see
ordinary situations and relations as devoid of sexual content,
but must, on occasion, interject sexual significance where it
does not exist or, at the very least, need not exist.  Following
the logical conclusions of this experiment, we are compelled to
conclude that there is something substantively different about
the way homosexuals and heterosexuals look at the world.[13]
<P>
In evaluating the MAPS and TAT results for stability, the single
judge assigned &quot;top&quot; scores to no one; 9 homosexuals
and 7 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to top&quot;; 15 homosexuals
and 19 heterosexuals were ranked &quot;average&quot;; 6 homosexuals
and 3 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to bottom&quot;; and
no homosexuals and 1 heterosexual were ranked at the &quot;bottom.&quot;
 (Again, critics say that the absence of &quot;blindness&quot;
raises the possibility that the Rosenthal Effect was again operative
in the evaluation process, since the judge knew what Hooker was
seeking.)
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The remainder of her study is a highly selective summary of comments
by judges, all of which support her thesis that the two groups
are, in effect, indistinguishable in terms of &quot;overall adjustment.&quot;
 In her own evaluation of the results, Hooker -- aware of the
degree to which she is challenging leading authorities in the
field -- offers a set of &quot;admissions&quot; about the limitations
of her study.  In this section she concedes the possibility that
homosexuals are indeed pathological, a point overlooked by most
of her admirers.
<P><UL>
<LI>She speculates that the psychological defect of homosexuals
may lie &quot;in a weakness of ego-function and control and that
this cannot be adequately diagnosed from projective test protocols.
 As one psychiatrist puts it, the material produced in the Rorschach
is like that produced on the analytic couch.  Two men may produce
very similar material on the couch, but the difference between
them is that one -- the normal -- gets up at the end of the hour
and resumes his normal functioning, while the other does not.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>She also admits that the pathology of homosexuality may only
occur &quot;in an erotic situation and that the homosexual can
function well in non-erotic situations such as the Rorschach,
TAT, and MAPS.  Thus, one could defend the hypothesis that homosexuality
is symptomatic of pathology, but that the pathology is confined
to one sector of behavior, namely, the sexual.&quot;[15] (She seems
to have disproved this proposition by her own study, since the
homosexuals were unable to control their sexual fantasies, even
in a &quot;non-erotic situation&quot; such as taking the MAPS
and TAT.)
<P>
<LI>During Hooker's research, she took the life histories of her
subjects; and though she didn't include an analysis of these materials
in her study, she did indicate that when she eventually published
her results, &quot;the life history data from the two groups will
differ:  namely, in the love relationships.  Comparisons between
the number and duration of love relationships, cruising patterns,
and degree of satisfaction with sexual pattern and the love partner
will certainly show clear-cut differences.&quot;[16]
</UL>
Hooker never published the summary of these histories, though
in a fairly recent interview with writer-researcher Edward Eichel,
she said she still hoped to do so after 35 years.  However, she
undoubtedly found in these personal histories what most other
researchers have found:  a substantially greater number of sexual
partners among homosexuals than heterosexuals and a significantly
shorter duration in relationships.  These findings, if published,
could well have cast further doubts on the stability and normalcy
of homosexuals.
<P>
It is significant to note that Hooker's stated reservations seldom,
if ever, find their way into the summaries of her work -- summaries
that are now <I>de rigeur</I> in legal and scholarly discussions
of homosexuality.  Her 1957 report has, like a folk tale, become
simpler and purer in the constant retelling.  Instead of a complicated
account filled with the predictable complexity of life, we now
have only Beauty and the Beast.     
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CITATIONS AND  USES OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Perhaps as important as the Hooker 1957 research itself is the
use that others have made of her findings.  Not only has this
single study with only 60 subjects been cited repeatedly by prominent
psychiatrists, social critics, and gay activists; but such summaries
have also been accepted as part of the expert testimony in high-profile
court cases nationwide.
<P>
Curiously, many of those who cite the study not only incorrectly
summarize its content but do so in remarkably similar fashion.
 It's as if one commentator misread Hooker and all the rest derived
their knowledge from that single erroneous commentary.  Here are
several examples:     
<P><UL>
<LI>In the <I>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry</I>, Dr. Judd
Marmor, a driving force in the American Psychiatric Association's
decision to drop homosexuality from its manual of disorders, has
written this summary of Hooker's research: &quot;Hooker (1957)
conducted a cooperative study of 30 male homosexuals and 30 male
heterosexuals who were matched for age, I.Q., and education. 
The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals 0 on the
Kinsey scale.  None of the subjects was in therapy.  Two judges
independently, without prior knowledge of which subjects were
which, reviewed the Rorschach protocols, Thematic Apperception
Tests, and Make-a-Picture-Story responses, and tried to distinguish
the homosexuals from the heterosexuals, but they were unable to
do so.&quot;[17]
<P><UL>
<LI>Marmor repeated this very passage when he submitted an affidavit
in <I>Morales v. Texas</I>, a case heard before a state court
in Texas.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Gregory Herek supported Marmor's testimony in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, saying under oath: &quot;The classic study in this
case was conducted by Hooker (1957).  She administered the Rorschach,
Thematic Apperception Test, and Make-A-Picture-Story Test...When
asked to assess which protocols were obtained from homosexuals,
the experts were unable to distinguish respondents' sexual orientation
at a level better than chance.&quot;[18]
<P>
<LI>In a 1990 article on Hooker, <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter
Bruce Shenitz described the experiment in precisely the same way:
 &quot;On all three tests, two-thirds of the heterosexuals and
homosexuals were assigned a rating of 3 (average) or better. 
Next, the judges were presented with pairs of tests and asked
to distinguish between heterosexuals and homosexual.  They were
able to do so no more accurately than if they were flipping a
coin.&quot;[19]
</UL></UL>
This striking agreement among scientific experts and the working
press is remarkable, especially when one realizes that all of
these accounts <I>are untrue</I>.  Marmor's version is particularly
faulty.  Indeed, the brief passage quoted above contains five
demonstrable errors of fact.
<P>
1.  &quot;The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals
0 on the Kinsey scale.&quot;  In the first place, in her report
Hooker makes no reference whatsoever to the Kinsey scale.  In
the second place, she gives evidence in her narrative to contradict
Marmor's generalization.  Three heterosexuals reported homosexual
contact after adolescence and three homosexuals reported heterosexual
behavior.  Kinsey described his &quot;0&quot; rating as &quot;[e]xclusively
heterosexual with no homosexual&quot; and his &quot;6&quot; rating
as &quot;[e]xclusively homosexual.&quot;
<P>
2. There were three judges involved rather than two, as Marmor
reports.
<P>
3. Dr. Marmor reports that the judges reviewed all three tests
when, in fact, two judges reviewed the Rorschach and one judge
reviewed the MAPS and TAT.
<P>
4. Dr. Marmor states that the judges reviewed the MAPS and the
TAT, as well as the Rorschach, in an attempt to distinguish between
heterosexual and homosexual subjects when, in fact, no judge was
asked to make this distinction for the MAPS and TAT because Hooker
knew the homosexuals had &quot;outed&quot; themselves.  
<P>
5. Contrary to what Marmor states, the MAPS and TAT did indeed
reveal the sexual orientation of the homosexuals.  
<P>
Both Herek and Shenitz make some of the same errors Marmor makes.
<P>
1. They suggest that more than one judge reviewed all test results.
<P>
2. They also state that after looking at the results of all three
tests, the &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;judges&quot; were unable
to distinguish between homosexual and heterosexual subjects.
<P>
Shenitz is no more than a newspaper reporter, but in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, Marmor and Herek were testifying as expert scientific
witnesses before a judge -- Marmor as former president of the
American Psychiatric Association.  It is ironic that while the
Morales judge accepted the testimony of Marmor and Herek without
question, he ignored the research of Paul Cameron, who gives a
careful and precise summary of the Hooker study in his volume
<I>The Gay Nineties: What the Empirical Evidence Reveals About
Homosexuality</I>.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
This unquestioning acceptance of &quot;authorities&quot; on the
basis of professional reputation or political correctness threatens
the integrity of our legal system.  Judges must take greater responsibility
for assessing the soundness and accuracy of testimony by so-called
experts; yet, paradoxically, such a task is manifestly beyond
the competence of the court.  This dilemma is the consequence
of the politicizing of the scientific community over the past
several decades, particularly in questions of sexuality.  The
recent exposure of Kinsey's errors indicates just how long researchers
have been careless or deliberately misleading in approaching sexual
questions.  And the widespread acclamation of recent, flawed studies
&quot;proving&quot; that homosexuality is inherited genetically
is evidence that the problem has only worsened over the years.

<P>
The 1995 federal appropriation bills which were approved by the
last Congress are filled with duplication, political favoritism,
social agendas, and questionable grants.  The alarming misuse
of taxpayer money should encourage citizens to demand more accountability.
<P>
Consider some government spending already approved for 1995:
<P>
<UL><LI> The Corporation for Public Broadcasting may pay a single individual
$438,000 for a once-a-week, 30-minute TV appearance.[1]
<P>
<LI>Federally financed Howard University gets $5.5 million to prepare
practicing attorneys to do pro bono work in Washington, DC.
<P>
<LI>NIH will spend $2.5 million to build playgrounds for monkeys.
<P>
<LI>DOT will spend $400,000 to help Russians build roads.
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon will spend $18 million for new homes at an Army
base that is losing one third of its existing personnel.
<P>
<LI>The State Department will give Russians $15 million for &quot;family
planning.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The State Department will spend $750,000 to study tropical bird
migration.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $250,000 to control zebra mussels in the
City of Chicago.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $70,000 to study a European fish in Lake
Superior.
<P>
<LI>HUD will spend $53 million for a sewage plant in Mexico.
<P>
<LI>The Forest Service will spend $635,000 to build a visitor center
on a remote and inaccessible by road peninsula on Alaska's panhandle.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>DETAILS FROM 13 APPROPRIATION BILLS</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Foreign aid in non-foreign bills</B>:  The appropriations
bill for &quot;The ForeignOperations, Export Financing, and Related Programs for the Fiscal
Year Ending September 30, 1995&quot; includes funding for most
foreign aid programs.  Foreign aid, however, can be found in other
bills.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Federal Highway Administration was given $400,000 to provide
technical assistance to Russia.[2] 
<P>
<LI>The Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was given
$52.5 million to finance the construction of a waste treatment
plant in Tijuana, Mexico.[3]  HUD is funding a second wastewater
facility near Micicali, Mexico for $47.5 million.[4] (Congress also
appropriated $1 million through the International Boundary and
Water Commission to reimburse the City of San Diego for treatment
of Tijuana sewage.[5]) 
<P>
<LI>Funding for the Smithsonian Institution includes a $50,000 grant
to the Mpala Center, Kenya for facility and equipment purchases.[6]
</UL>
<B>2. Suspect foreign aid</B>.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The State Department will provide $15 million for &quot;family
planning&quot; to Russia in 1995.[7]
<P>
<LI>It will give $50 million to the United Nation Population Fund
(UNPF) with the intention that none of this money will be used
to fund abortions in China.[8] The UNPF is expected to give $7 million
for &quot;voluntary family planning programs&quot; in China.[9]
<P>
<LI>The State Department will grant $750,000 to the Fish and Wildlife
Foundation to study neotropical migratory bird conservation.[10]
</UL>
<B>3. Duplication of programs</B>.  Our government should
look to eliminate redundancy.  Consider:
<P><UL>
<LI>The Treasury Department's plan to build a training facility
near Tuscon, Arizona.  There will be a dormitory, a dining facility
and $2.9 million in firearm ranges.[11] Just outside of Tuscon is
the Army's Fort Huachuca, which has many modern firearm ranges.
 Treasury should arrange with the Army to use existing ranges
rather than building duplicate firing facilities.  After all,
the FBI Academy's entire campus is located on Quantico Marine
Base in Virginia where it has joint use of all ranges.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was appropriated
$175,000 for a special purpose grant to be given to Domestic Violence
Prevention, Inc. in Bowie County, Texas.[12] Why is housing money
used for this project when the 1994 crime bill authorizes $324
million for the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act?[13]
The crime bill also has $10 million for nonprofit organizations
to establish projects that coordinate intervention and prevention
of domestic violence, and authorizes $30 million for rural domestic
violence and child abuse enforcement.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Interior received $800,000 to monitor salmon
on Alaska's Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers.[14] The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will spend another $700,000
to collect information on salmon in the Yukon River as well.[15]
NOAA collects information on salmon at other locations as well.
<P>
<LI>The Small Business Administration is directed to grant $3.25
million for three incubator facilities.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Justice Department is appropriated $29 million for &quot;Drug
Courts&quot; which is a program that provides drug treatment during
and after incarceration for non-violent offenders.[17] This replicates
ongoing programs both inside prisons and in many communities.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation was appropriated $2 million
to establish in 1995 an interdisciplinary center to support research
on violence.[18] The 1994 crime bill authorizes many programs to
research violence:[19]
<P><UL>
<LI>Title IV-Violence Against Women Act of 1994 requires the Attorney
General to study campus sexual assaults, the &quot;battered women's
syndrome,&quot; the abusive spouse, and domestic violence.[20]
<P>
<LI>Title III-Crime Prevention includes research grants to investigate
juvenile violence, drug use, and gang violence.[21]
<P>
<LI>Virtually every section of the crime bill requires at least
one federal agency to either study or research special aspects
of violence.[22]
</UL><P>
<LI>HUD will award housing money for six substance abuse programs
and eight crime prevention programs.[23] The 1994 crime bill includes
duplicate grant programs.
<P>
<LI>Congress has already appropriated $20.4 million for federal
support of the 1995 Special Olympics in New Haven, Connecticut
and both the XXVI Olympiad and the X Paralympiad in Atlanta in
1996.[24] The GSA and HUD will contribute $3 million to the X Paralympiad.
 (The Paralympiad was established in 1960 to create awareness
of athletes with physical disabilities.)  The X Paralympiad will
take place in Atlanta August 16-17, just after the Olympic Games.
 Some 4,000 athletes representing 110 countries are expected to
participate.  HUD's contribution goes to assist disabled veterans
to participate.
<P>
<LI>Congress appropriated $5.6 million for the taxpayer funded District
of Columbia School of Law ignoring Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's
recommendation to close the school.  Two of the best law schools
in the nation are in Washington, D.C. - Georgetown University
and American University and another is in nearby Baltimore.  Additionally,
the appropriation bill lists the other reasons to close the school:
it must dramatically expand its library before it can earn full
accreditation; it must increase faculty salaries and other staff
and student services; and the school needs a permanent facility
of at least 125,000 square feet.[25]
</UL>
<B>4. Spending to remember former Congressional Leaders.</B>
<P><UL>
<LI>The National Historical Publications and Records Commission
is giving $2 million to the Thomas P. &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill,
Jr. Library at Boston College.[26] The money will be used to organize
Mr. O'Neill's personal papers.  
<P>
<LI>Two million dollars was also granted to the Robert H. and Corinne
W. Michel Congressional Education Fund.[27]  Michel was for many years
the House minority leader.  
<P>
<LI>The Merit Systems Protection Board granted $10 million to the
Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental
Policy Foundation.[28] Udall was a liberal congressman and environmentalist
from Arizona.
</UL>
<B>5. Other questionable expenditures.</B>  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Army recently announced that the 1st Infantry Division headquartered
at Fort Riley, Kansas will be removed from the force.  This means
approximately 5,600 soldiers or a third of the post's population
will leave.  Meanwhile, Congress has appropriated $12.6 million
to build 126 new homes at Fort Riley.[29]
<P>
<LI>The 6th Infantry Division headquartered at Fort Wainwright,
Alaska was deactivated in July, 1994.  Cuts in the Army's presence
in Alaska will be felt at both Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson
which is near Anchorage.  Yet, Congress appropriated $5 million
to build 72 new homes at Fort Richardson and $66 million to replace
the nearby and jointly used Elmendorf Air Force Base hospital.[30]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture's Forest Service will spend $635,000
to build a visitor center at Ketchikan, Alaska.  Ketchikan is
located on a remote peninsula reachable only by boat and small
plane.  Ketchikan county has a population of 14,000 inhabitants
scattered among numerous small villages.  The Department also
gave $500,000 to Alaska because &quot;many timber mills have closed.&quot;[31]
<P>
<LI>The National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research
Resources, was directed by the conference committee to reserve
$2.5 million for playgrounds for monkeys used in research.[32]
<P>
<LI>The federal government helps to fund Washington, D.C.'s Howard
University.  Part of the University's 1995 appropriations ($5.5
million) are for the creation of a Law School Clinical Center
to provide legal assistance to supplement the Legal Services Corporation
and to conduct training for practicing attorneys to perform pro
bono (free) services.[33]
</UL>
<B>6. Did you know?</B>  Here are some of the various
and sundry federal spending programs.
<P><UL>
<LI>$46 million to build and operate military child development
centers, including one in Germany and one in Great Britain.[34] These
federally subsidized centers are part of a growing network of
child care facilities that include every military activity worldwide.
<P>
<LI>$45 million will be spent by the Library of Congress for books
for blind and physically handicapped people.[35]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Transportation will give $26 million for employee
bonuses and cash awards.[36]
<P>
<LI>$2.7 million to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.[37]
 This 34 person organization oversees construction projects along
Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.
<P>
<LI>$27 million annual operating expenses for the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Council, which is a private organization that oversees
the Holocaust Museum.[38] This relatively small but popular museum
was first opened to the public two years ago.  It was built with
$168 million in private donations raised in just four years.[39]
The Council continues to receive donations from many national
and local organizations.
<P>
<LI>Child Nutrition Programs include $500,000 in state grants for
special dietary needs of children with disabilities.[40]
<P>
<LI>$7 million for the private organization American Printing House
for the Blind.[41]
<P>
<LI>The State Department oversees a $533 million United Nations
peacekeeping appropriation.  This money can be spent with one
stipulation: that American manufacturers and suppliers are given
an &quot;equal&quot; opportunity to provide equipment, services,
and materials to the United Nations peacekeepers.[42] The Senate
amended this appropriation to transfer $350 million to unspecified
&quot;International Organizations&quot; for peacekeeping activities.[43]
<P>
<LI>HUD will grant the City of Chicago $250,000 to control zebra
mussels which originally came from the Black Sea area of Europe.[44]
 The Department of Interior will continue to study zebra mussels
at St. Croix, Virgin Islands.[45] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration was appropriated $3.7 million to research zebra
mussels.[46] If the zebra mussel is truly endangering our oceans
and lakes, then a more focused effort should be undertaken.
</UL>
<B>7. Legislating inside appropriation bills.</B>  Five
appropriation bills contain social legislation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Architect of the Capitol is directed to hire a &quot;diverse
labor force.&quot;[47] This means hiring quotas.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation is directed to award at least
20 percent of all grants to small colleges and universities that
consist of &quot;predominantly underrepresented groups&quot; in
science and technology.[48]
<P>
<LI>When hiring investigators the John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Review Board is directed to give preferential treatment
to former Office of Personnel Management employees.[49]
<P>
<LI>The Office of Personnel Management is encouraged to promote
&quot;diversity.&quot;  OPM's definition of &quot;diversity&quot;
includes people of different sexual orientation.[50]
<P>
<LI>The appropriation bill for the Department of Agriculture deletes
Senate language aimed at ending the use of taxpayer funds to promote
homosexuality.[51]
<P>
<LI>Health and Human Services is directed to increase quotas for
black nurses nationally.[52]
<P>
<LI>The Federal Bureau of Investigation was appropriated funds to
restore special agents &quot;eliminated in prior years associated
with background investigations.&quot;[53] A former marker for elimination
based on a background investigation was identifying the candidate
as a homosexual.  The FBI Academy has started training for homosexuals
previously rejected.
</UL>
<B>8. Please explain these appropriations.</B>  Many programs
are funded without adequate explanation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Education is awarding $4 million to the Mary
McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center on the campus of Bethune
Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida.[54] The facility will
allow students to be trained for the fields of entertainment and
hotel management.[55]
<P>
<LI>The U.S. Institute of Peace gets $11.5 million.[56] The ten year
old institute has received $76 million in federal grants.  In
1991 it shifted from discussing peace to teaching conflict resolution
in America's classrooms.  There are more than 300 violence-prevention
programs and 100 conflict resolution curricula available to America's
28,000 high schools and 78,000 grade schools.[57] The 1994 crime
bill contains many grants for anti-violence programs.  
<P>
<LI>The Bureau of Mines is directed to do &quot;essential Arctic
research&quot; in Anchorage, Alaska.[58]  Anchorage is 400 miles south
of the Arctic Circle and has no arctic characteristics like permafrost.
 Why not conduct the research nearer the Arctic Circle, perhaps
at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks?
<P>
<LI>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration
is appropriated $1.5 million for the Pan-Pacific Educational and
Cultural Experiments by Satellite Program.[59]
<P>
<LI>Washington, D.C. received $720 million from the federal government
for public education.  The appropriation bill states, &quot;the
Board of Education has overspent its appropriation for personal
services by millions of dollars while underspending its appropriation
for other-than-personal-services by an equal amount.  The chronic
recurrence of such an imbalance suggests that the Board of Education
habitually submits budgets to the Congress that the Board knows
to be unrealistic and that the Board intends to disregard.&quot;[60]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development will award 261
special purpose grants worth $291 million.[61] These include:
<P><UL>
<LI>$450,000 to construct the Center for Political Participation
at the University of Maryland.[62] The Center &quot;is the first
academically-sanctioned program in the country to support young
leaders seeking elective office.&quot;[63] The advisory board includes
actress Morgan Fairchild, Congressman Steny Hoyer, Congresswoman
Connie Morella, <I>ABC News'</I> Sheila Kast, and the wife of
Maryland governor Parris Glendening.[64]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 to the Maine College of Art for renovations to a Portland
building.[65]
<P>
<LI>$1 million to develop the Center for Pacific Rim Studies in
San Francisco.[66] The Center will do research on competition and
offer training for professionals.  It is focused on trade development,
including foreign language and culture, legal systems, commercial
practices and data links.[67]
<P>
<LI>$6.5 million for the Points of Light Foundation.[68] The <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> found that the Foundation in its first four
years spent $22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million
on grants to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million
for a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to the Hill
and Knowlton public relations firm to promote the party, as well
as a $160,000 salary for its top executive.  In the first four
years, it received $26 million from the government.[69]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 for the National Invention Resource Center in the
City of Akron, Ohio.[70] The Center is part of the nonprofit Inventure
Place which opens July, 1995.
<P>
<LI>$70,000 to study the European Ruffe in Lake Superior.[71] The
Ruffe was introduced in 1986 to Duluth Harbor which is on Lake
Superior.  The Ruffe now makes up 65 percent of the harbor's fish
population.  Why is federal housing money being used to study
the spread of this fish?  Possibly some of the $450,000 appropriated
for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission could be used to study
the Ruffe.[72]
<P>
<LI>$750,000 for a center to coordinate academic training for physical
therapists at the Veterans' Administration hospitals in Brooklyn,
NY.[73]
<P>
<LI>$2.5 million for Project Social Care MB, Inc. to serve elderly
Holocaust survivors in Brooklyn, NY.[74] There are about 2,000 Holocaust
survivors in the greater New York metro area.  Another organization,
Selfhelp Community Services, has a $51 million annual budget and
has the prime focus on helping survivors.[75]
<P>
<LI>$250,000 for port modernization at Davisville, Rhode Island.[76]
<P>
<LI>$300,000 to expand the science and mathematics complex at the
University of South Carolina.[77]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for the Fire Safe Cigarette Act.[78] These funds
go to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology to measure the cigarette's
ignition propensity.[79]
<P>
<LI>HUD special purpose grants also fund: 5 child care centers,
the restoration of 5 theaters/museums, restoring or building 5
libraries, running a summer camp program, and building a bicentennial
and media activities center for a city.[80]
</UL></UL>
<B>9. AIDS money scattered among bills.</B>  Most AIDS
money is found in the appropriations for HHS, but AIDS money is
in other bills as well.
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture will grant Indiana $250,000 to
study HIV/STD prevention in rural areas.[81]
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon is being given $33 million to study AIDS.[82]
<P>
<LI>HUD is appropriated $186 million for housing people with AIDS.[83]
 HUD also is awarding special purpose grants worth $4.3 million
for other HIV housing facilities.[84]
</UL>
<B>10. Politics and agriculture appropriations.</B>  The
1995 agriculture appropriations appear to be based more on politics
than merit.  The top three states to receive agriculture grants
earmarked by state were Arkansas, Iowa and Mississippi.[85] Arkansas
received $17.7 million, Iowa received $11.9 million, and Mississippi
received $10.45 million.
<P>
Senators from these states were on the conference committee for
appropriations.  Additionally, President Clinton is from Arkansas
and former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Epsy is from Mississippi.
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce reports that the highest net farm
income for 1991 came from California which ranked seventh in discretionary
agriculture grants.  Mississippi ranked 21 in net income and Arkansas
was ninth.[86] But Arkansas received almost 300 percent more discretionary
grant money than California, the highest farm income state.  Arkansas
grants included:
<P><UL>
<LI>$462,000 for a National Center for Agricultural Law Research
and Information at the Leflar School of Law in Fayetteville, Arkansas.[87]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for a new agriculture building and $946,000 for
an Alternative Pest Control Center at the University of Arkansas.[88]
<P>
<LI>$4.8 million for the Rice Germplasm Center, Stuttgard, Arkansas.[89]
<P>
<LI>$1.1 million for the Arkansas Children's Hospital.[90]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Taxpayers should demand that the 104th Congress review and rescind
appropriations that waste money or promote a political agenda.

<P>
Thirty years ago this March, Daniel Patrick Moynihan issued his
famous warning about the breakdown of the black family.  At the
time, liberal intellectuals and civil rights activists excoriated
him for &quot;defending middle-class values.&quot;  &quot;What
may seem to be a disease to the white middle class may be a healthy
adaptation to the Negro lower class,&quot;[1] Bayard Rustin intoned.
<P>
Today, however, overwhelming empirical evidence demonstrates that
there is nothing at all &quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of
families and that not all personal choices are equal in terms
of their impact on children, families, and communities.  The evidence
itself has propelled illegitimacy to the forefront of the current
national debate over welfare reform.
<P>
While a burgeoning white illegitimacy rate has helped strip the
debate of racial overtones, a black Democrat named Wayne Bryant
has pioneered in the state of New Jersey one of the key anti-illegitimacy
provisions recently adopted by the U.S. House.  The so-called
&quot;family cap&quot; would deny benefit increases to mothers
who bear additional illegitimate children while on welfare.
<P>
The essential purpose of the reform, according to Bryant, is to
restore healthy families.  &quot;Until the needs and the problems
of the family are confronted in a comprehensive way, welfare will
continue its course of entrapping one generation after the next
in a modern form of slavery,&quot;[2] he wrote in a paper describing
his proposal.
<P>
By incorporating the family cap, Senator Bryant intended, not
to constrict reproductive choices or to reduce births per se,
but to promote a sense of responsibility by insisting that families
on welfare live by the same values and confront exactly the same
choices as the general population.  He explained the rationale
for the cap in a series of newspaper interviews:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These welfare reform measures are not so much about capping family
size as they are about giving recipients a chance to make choices.
 Under our conventional welfare system, 
welfare mothers are effectively shielded from confronting the
difficult questions that other American parents face when considering
additional children.... I never pretended or intended to have
the law bring about a dramatic increase in births.  It was a responsibility
issue.... Why should people on welfare be guaranteed a 'raise'
when they have additional children?  If a person wants to enlarge
their family while on welfare, they should go to work to support
the additional children like any other working family....No one
is saying welfare mothers can't have families.  We're just saying
the state won't pay for it....If the kids are suffering because
parents are irresponsible in having children they cannot afford,
they'll still suffer if we give them the money because the parents
will still be irresponsible....The battle is dissolving the wall
that separates welfare families from the mainstream population
-- and the cap is an important part of that effort.[3]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Echoing Senator Bryant's most popular argument, California's welfare
commissioner Eloise Anderson is even more blunt: &quot;Working
women do not get automatic raises when they have children.  Why
should our expectations of a woman on AFDC be any different than
any other woman?  Do we think they're stupider or less capable
of being rational?&quot;[4] New Jersey's human services commissioner,
William Waldman, agrees: &quot;A lot of what we do [in the name
of welfare] is very patronizing.&quot;[5]
<P>
Since the family cap took effect in New Jersey in August of 1993,
the birth rate among welfare mothers in the state has dropped
substantially -- powerful proof that women on welfare are indeed
capable of governing their own decisions.  Robert Rector of the
Heritage Foundation estimates a decrease greater than 20 percent;[6]
but like Wayne Bryant, he too emphasizes that even if the birthrate
had not fallen the policy would be justified.  &quot;I support
the family cap simply because it's morally correct,&quot;[7] Rector
says.
<P>
Even the more conservative estimate of the birthrate decrease
reported by the New Jersey Department of Human Services (11.4
percent)[8] vindicates the two fundamental principles underlying
the current national debate: that economic incentives do influence
out-of-wedlock childbearing and that subsidizing irresponsible
sexual behavior has accelerated the moral and cultural decline
beyond what even Moynihan envisioned.
<P>
While Charles Murray notes that much of the force of noneconomic
social stigma was underwritten by economics in the past, he argues
that contemporary &quot;[w]elfare will not be abolished [despite
the potential economic savings to communities] until the moral
sanctions against illegitimacy have also gained great strength.&quot;[9]
 The seeming paradox highlights the difficulty of defining precisely
how government can promote character formation.
<P>
James Q. Wilson answers that &quot;[t]he essential first step
is to acknowledge that at root, in almost every area of important
public concern, we are seeking to induce persons to act virtuously&quot;[10]
-- a statement that has grown less controversial in the 30 years
since the Moynihan Report met with violent protest from moral
relativists who denied the existence of an absolute standard of
virtue.  Today, there is a mounting public consensus that bearing
children out of wedlock is wrong and that the perverse incentives
of the welfare system share much of the blame.
<P>
In a continuation of the same passage, Professor Wilson explains
the moral implications of economic incentives: &quot;Virtue is
not learned by precept...; it is learned by the regular repetition
of right actions.... Seen this way, there is no conflict between
economic thought and moral philosophy: The latter simply supplies
a fuller statement of the uses to which the former can and should
be put.  We...induce habits of right conduct...by arranging the
incentives confronting youngsters in the ordinary aspects of their
daily lives so that right action routinely occurs.&quot;[11]
<P>
Yet, morality is not merely a product of rational choices in response
to economic incentives.  If man is more than a material being,
then it is not unreasonable to expect some individual moral decisions
to override the economic incentives that run against the grain
of virtue.  Nor is it implausible to suggest that, of all the
choices an individual mother must make, the decision to abort
her child -- the most galvanizing moral issue of our day -- is
the one least likely to respond to policy variables.  
<P>
Precisely because human behavior is governed by a unique complex
of moral instinct and rational choice, the elimination of additional
cash benefits in New Jersey has decreased the birthrate without
causing an upsurge in the abortion rate.  While it is far too
premature to draw any decisive conclusions, there is absolutely
no statistical confirmation as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the New Jersey family cap took effect August
1, 1993.In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions in New Jersey
declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[12]
<P>
In fact, Anita Leone, executive director of an association that
represents all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey,
asserted in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in
New Jersey are currently <I>decreasing</I>.  We just don't know
why.&quot;[13] Because the decline in the birth rate among welfare
mothers in New Jersey has been rather substantial since the implementation
of the family cap, the fact that an increase in abortions is not
evident is particularly significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the front-lines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds <I>not</I>
to terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[14]
<P>
Women interviewed at Chelton Terrace in New Jersey said &quot;they
didn't see the cap forcing women into abortion clinics.  'It's
not going to make them get any more abortions than what they've
been getting,' one woman said.  'If you want to have that baby,
you will.'&quot;[15] Another woman in Camden, New Jersey said that
she knew about the cap but decided to have her baby anyway.  &quot;Abortion
is against my faith,&quot;[16] she explained.
<P>
A church pastor in the same town related a telling story.  A young
welfare mother had come to the church grieving over a miscarriage.
 Another pastor gently reminded her that she really had no way
of providing for a second child and that the state would not increase
her grant.  &quot;But it just didn't make sense to her,&quot;[17]
the pastor concluded, because mothers do not tend to subject their
relationships with their children to a strict cost-benefit analysis.
 Only the most callous of mothers places a price tag on her baby's
head.
<P>
One welfare mother recently quoted in <i>The New York Times</i>
said it perhaps most eloquently: &quot;[My fourth child] wasn't
planned, but I wasn't going to abort her.  Sixty-four dollars
is not going to change my love for my child, and if I would have
aborted her, it wouldn't have comforted my soul.... You just learn
that a pound of ground beef is overrated.&quot;[18]
<P>
Michelle Scholz of the Northwest Pregnancy Center in Washington,
D.C. explains that in her experience a mother decides first whether
or not to keep her baby and, then, how to pay for the child's
care.[19] Sister Connie Driscoll, founder of St. Martin de Porres
House of Hope in Chicago, testifies that over 9,000 destitute
women have passed through her shelter in the last 12 years.  Not
one of those women has opted for an abortion.[20]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[21] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <i>lower</i> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[22]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrate that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[23]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
The findings in New Jersey are striking evidence of the latent
moral potential in welfare mothers that is begging to be cultivated,
rather than frustrated by the perpetuation of policies that subsidize
immorality.  Remedial policies should reconcile the current tension
between moral knowledge and the economic incentives of the welfare
system -- before moral knowledge is altogether gone from the inner
city.
<P>
Charles Murray explains that, when illegitimacy reaches a critical
mass, the neighborhood effects create problems that extend far
beyond the recipients of welfare.  Community values and the norms
for male behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young
men and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.[24]
<P>
Yet, conservatives must acknowledge that government cannot be
an effective moral teacher.  Public policy can undermine, but
never instill, virtue.
<P>
Rather than attempting to devise the perfect bundle of carrots
and sticks, we must eliminate altogether the government subsidies
that skew welfare recipients' decisions by shielding them from
the natural economic consequences.  Michael Tanner of the Cato
Institute writes: &quot;We could reasonably expect that people,
faced with the consequences of their actions, would change their
behavior.  Such an approach would avoid coercion and the conceit
that government knows best.&quot;[25]
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  In <i>The
Road to Serfdom</i>, F. A. Hayek emphasized the symbiotic relationship
between morality and freedom from government intervention:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Freedom to order our own conduct in the sphere where material
circumstances force a choice upon us, and responsibility for the
arrangement of our own life according to our own conscience, is
the air in which alone moral sense grows and in which moral values
are daily re-created in the free decision of the individual.[26]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It is the intrinsic truth of Hayek's observation that motivated
Wayne Bryant to institute the family cap in New Jersey -- a cap
he himself describes as a mechanism to reduce government constriction
of personal choices.[27]
<P>
Government must instead cede ground to the character-forming institutions
that are found in every community -- families, churches, schools,
charities, and other traditional arrangements that have been supplanted
by public authorities.  Rather than merely ending government programs,
conservatives intend to <I>replace</I> government welfare by advancing
proposals like a tax credit for charitable contributions that
will help to strengthen civil institutions.
<P>
Unless those institutions are reinvigorated and social functions
are restored to neighborhoods and communities, the behavioral
problems Daniel Patrick Moynihan described 30 years ago will only
continue to grow more acute, jeopardizing personal freedoms and
ultimately the survival of the republic itself.  If it is true
that moral values do not have concrete meaning in the absence
of freedom, it is also true that the preservation of political
liberty depends upon the cultivation 
of virtue in the people.

<P>
American families must balance expenses with income.  When this
fails, they delay clothing purchases or visits to the dentist.
  Such decisions are difficult,  but the alternative of  mounting
debt is too risky.  These hard-working taxpayers likewise expect
the federal government to keep its fiscal house in order by balancing
expenses with income.
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee is beginning
the process of balancing  the national budget.  The Committee
proposes a balanced budget by the year 2002, but to get there
will require a lot of  belt tightening.   
<P>
Their proposed budget includes many needed cuts.  They propose
to terminate, privatize, or convert to block grants three Cabinet
departments, 284 programs, 69 commissions, 13 agencies, and three
commercial activities.[1]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DEPARTMENTS TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The Department of Energy was created in 1977 by President Jimmy
Carter in response to the energy crisis of the early 1970s.  
The 20,213-employee agency promotes energy conservation, controls
federal supplies of power, and develops alternative sources of
energy.   However, 85 percent of DoE's budget is spent on activities
that are not energy related.[2]
<P>
The Department of Education was established in 1979 by President
Carter to expand the federal role in education.  The Department's
budget has doubled while student performance has declined.   According
to former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90
percent of the students entering U.S. colleges today would not
be admitted to post-secondary education anywhere else in the world.[3]
 In fact, only a small part of federal education spending reaches
American classrooms.  Most of the Department's current functions
of technical assistance and information can be transferred to
the states or other federal agencies.
<P>
The Department of Commerce was created in 1903 and spends $3.6
billion per year on more than 100 programs of which three-fourths
are duplicated by other federal agencies.  More than half of the
Department's budget and a third of its employees staff the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.[4] This organization would
become an independent agency.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AGENCIES TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Just as America's taxpayers can do without the three cabinet-level
departments targeted for elimination in the House GOP Budget,
they can surely get along without the 13 agencies the House GOP
Budget would eliminate.  For example:
<UL>
<LI>The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration was created in
1981 and spends $17 million per year promoting tourism and recreation
activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material,
and running regional marketing shows.  There is no reason for
the federal government to be involved in an activity that is already
handled by a prosperous private industry.[5]
<P>
<LI>The Minority Business Development Agency was created in 1971
to promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to
steer these businesses toward government contracts.  It was appropriated
$44 million in fiscal 1996 even though it duplicates a  loan program
run by the Small Business Administration.[6] 
<P>
<LI>The Maritime Administration was created in 1950 to tap the
domestic maritime fleet in case of national emergency.  Unfortunately,
the government-owned &quot;Ready Reserve Force&quot; was not seaworthy
during the Persian Gulf call-up.   The Maritime Administration
is part of the Department of Transportation and primarily acts
as a custodian of federal subsidies used to shield U.S. vessels
from foreign competition.[7]  But most (96 percent) of all waterborne
cargo entering or leaving the U.S. is on American vessels.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>PROGRAMS ELIMINATED (284)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Likewise, most taxpayers aren't likely to miss the 284 programs
eliminated by the House GOP Budget.  These programs include:
<UL>
<LI>The Federal Helium Reserve and Processing Facility will cost
$26 million over the next five years.  It was established in 1925
to insure a constant supply of helium for military blimps and
observation balloons which are no longer used.  The United States
produces most of the world's helium, exporting 5.5 times as much
helium as is produced worldwide.  But the government stays in
the helium business because of a federal ban prohibiting NASA
and the Pentagon from purchasing privately produced helium.[8]
<P>
<LI>The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, which will
spend $2.7 million in 1995, was established in 1972 to oversee
the &quot;Avenue's revitalization.&quot;  The corporation is governed
by a 23-member board which oversees joint ventures with the private
sector, sponsors festivals, cultural performances, and athletic
events on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.[9]
<P>
<LI>The Points of Light Foundation in its first four years spent
$22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million on grants
to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million for
a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to a public
relations firm to promote the party, as well as a $160,000 salary
for its top executive.[10]
<P>
<LI>The National Rail Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK) was created
in 1970 to take over the nation's ailing private passenger rail
service.  It has cost the taxpayer $17 billion but carries less
than one-half of one percent of America's inter-city passengers
or about 22 million passengers a year, a quarter of the entire
rail passenger service.[11]
<P>
<LI>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was established
in 1968 and now sponsors more than 600 National Public Radio (NPR)
stations and 340 Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television
stations.  PBS and NPR are primarily (80 percent) funded through
private and non-federal public donations, but the federal share
provided by CPB for fiscal year 1996  is $286 million.[12]
<P>
<LI>The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was created in 1974 to
provide low-income individuals with legal representation. LSC
will spend part of this year's $415 million budget to fund lobbying
or campaigning for local political initiatives.  The agency, a
piggybank for left-wing causes, has fought reforms designed to
reduce out-of-wedlock births; filed suit against a nonprofit homeless
shelter; and tried to create a &quot;constitutional right&quot;
to federal welfare.[13]
<P>
<LI>The AmeriCorps program, created by President Clinton, funds
community-based organizations &quot;to address problems they identify
by using the skills of individuals serving in National Service
positions.&quot;  Participants are given a stipend, an educational
award or credit toward student loan repayment, medical benefits,
and free child care for volunteer work.  The taxpayer cost for
each &quot;volunteer&quot; exceeds $30,000 or more than $3 billion
over the next five years.[14]
<P>
<LI>The National Endowment for the Arts has been a platform for
attacks on religion, traditional art forms, traditional families
and traditional values, and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement-a mark of
quality and achievement.&quot;[15] In 1994, the private sector donated
more than $9.6 billion to the arts.
<P>
<LI>The Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center located
on the Campus of Bethune Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida
received a grant of $4 million from the Department of Education.
 The facility will allow students to be trained for the fields
of entertainment and hotel management, fields adequately covered
by the private sector.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Essential Air Service Program (EASP) was created in 1978
to continue air service to small communities.  EASP will spend
$28 million in 1996 subsidizing commuter service to 80 communities.
 It was initially authorized for a ten-year period.  The subsidies
that these airlines receive from taxpayers range from $5 to $320
per passenger.[17]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>BOARDS, COMMISSIONS, AUTHORITIES TO BE ELIMINATED (269)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Similarly, it is difficult to justify deficit spending to support
many federal boards, commissions, and authorities.  Among those
the House GOP wants to delete are:
<UL>
<LI>The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887 to
oversee the rail industry.  It now oversees rail traffic, trucking,
barges, buses, freight forwarders and express companies.   Legislation
that deregulated transportation has increased competition and
made the ICC largely obsolete.[18]
<P>
<LI>The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was created in 1965
to fight poverty.  It is one of 62 federal economic development
programs under 18 federal departments and agencies.  ARC is currently
funded at $200 million.[19]
<P>
<LI>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created in 1933 to
generate and distribute electric power for the Tennessee Valley.
 Today, TVA manages locks, dams and recreation areas, operates
a research center, and funds economic development.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES TO BE PRIVATIZED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Rather than believing worthwhile public functions must be performed
by government, the House GOP Budget plan recognizes that commercial
activities ought to be privatized.  Specifically:
<UL>
<LI>The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations
which sell electricity from 131 dams.  In 1994, the PMA's sold
$3 billion worth of electric power.  The Budget Committee recommends
selling four of the PMA's, which are not a profitable investment
for the taxpayer.[20] 
<P>
<LI>The Naval Petroleum Reserves were established in 1912 by Presidents
William Howard Taft and Woodwork Wilson to assure fuel for the
Navy.  The project oversees two commercial oil fields and an oil-shale
reserve.  Studies show that these facilities operate far less
efficiently than comparable privately-owned fields.[21]
<P>
<LI>The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC)  produces
and markets uranium enrichment services to private utilities in
the U.S. and abroad.  USEC advertises that it serves &quot;approximately
90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the
world market.&quot;[22] This taxpayer- financed commercial enterprise
could be sold for profit and operated more efficiently through
privatization.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Individually, these programmatic cuts may not amount to much;
 but collectively these changes translate into hundreds of billions
of taxpayer savings and a balanced federal budget by 2002.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The rates in columns 2 and 3 are defined as abortions per
1,000 females on AFDC.  The twelve months prior to implementation
of the cap are August 1992 through July 1993.  The cap took effect
August of 1993, and the most recent monthly data available are
March 1994 because of a time lag in reporting.</FONT>
<P>
<HR><P>
Together with all who decry abortion, the Family Research Council
reacted with concern to press reports Tuesday that New Jersey
experienced a &quot;slight increase in the abortion rate among
women on welfare during the first eight months since implementation
of the family cap.&quot;[1]
<P>
We were relieved to discover for ourselves and are now eager
to reassure fellow pro-life advocates that the data released do
not support the conclusion that the family cap has increased abortions.
<P>
Of course, no one can ascribe causality to the family cap, no
matter how the abortion rate appears to have changed.  Officials
from the New Jersey Department of Human Services themselves stress
emphatically that &quot;additional data and analysis are required
before any link can be made between the family cap and the abortion
rate.&quot;[2]
<P>
The much more immediate problem, however, is that the numbers
just released do not describe a consistent upward trend in abortions
as the accompanying press release suggested -- and the newspapers
then hastened to report.  Instead, the raw numbers indicate that
there is no real change in the rates, other than the normal month-to-month
fluctuation that would be expected regardless of the cap.   
<P>
Jacqueline Tencza, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of
Human Services, herself cautioned that &quot;the department does
not believe that the [perceived] increase is statistically significant
[i.e., other than a normal distribution of values] because it
is based on a short period of time and compared with only one
previous year.&quot;[3]
<P>
Upon closer scrutiny, the alleged &quot;increase in the abortion
rate&quot; is strictly a function of the particular eight-month
time period isolated for analysis.
<P>
The abortion rate for the month of March 1994 (or March 1993)
is noticeably and significantly greater than any other rate included
in the chart, in part because the month of March contains 23 weekdays
as opposed to the average 21.7 days.  Excluding that one anomalous
rate yields a total monthly average of 9.44 for the period following
implementation of the cap -- which is virtually equal to the pre-cap
average monthly abortion rate of 9.43.
<P>
Examining the pre-cap and post-cap numbers month by month helps
underscore the fact that a straightforward comparison of the two
8-month averages listed in the chart is meaningless.  Three of
the eight months before implementation of the cap in fact posted
a higher abortion rate than the corresponding months in the year
after the cap took effect.
<P>
The waters grow considerably murkier, moreover, when calculations
of average monthly abortion rates include the rates for the four
pre-implementation months in 1993 not included in the chart released
Tuesday.  When the rates for these months (10.96 in April 1993;
9.33 in May 1993; 10.9 in June 1993; and 10.34 in July 1993)[4] are
included, the average monthly abortion rate for the entire year
before implementation of the cap is 9.75 -- again, virtually equal
to the average rate for the eight months since the cap (the only
post-cap months for which data are currently available).  It is
possible, in fact, to isolate a different eight-month period prior
to the cap for which the average monthly abortion rate is higher
than the average calculated for the eight months post-cap.[5]
<P>
It would, of course, be foolish to jump to the conclusion that
abortions must have declined in New Jersey since implementation
of the cap -- but no more foolish than it is to conclude that
abortions have definitely increased in New Jersey, based on the
comparison of two 8-month averages.  It is worthwhile to note
in passing that to date the numbers do not exclude the possibility
that abortions have declined slightly since the cap took effect.
<P>
Given what limited data we have, however, it appears most probable
that the New Jersey family cap is essentially abortion-neutral.
 And we can assert with a large measure of confidence that the
fears of a large upsurge in the short-term abortion rate are unfounded.
<P>
But we repeat again, as we have carefully stated in all previous
comments on the family cap:  It is far too premature to draw any
decisive conclusions from the welfare reform experiment in New
Jersey.  Indeed, it would be a travesty for the national debate
over an issue as critical as welfare reform to rise or fall on
the basis of preliminary returns from one state.
<P>
New Jersey, of course, is a worst-case scenario for the family
cap because it is one of the few states that provides public funding
for abortion.  Failure to demonstrate a consistent, upward trend
in the abortion rate in New Jersey in particular confirms that
it is perfectly appropriate for the debate over the family cap
to go forward.  Given the pathologies of our current welfare system,
the debate <I>must</I> go forward.
<P>
Even with the release of the most recent data, there is still
every reason to theorize that the family cap may be functioning
as a new safeguard for the lives of the unborn.  To know whether
the net effect of the family cap is an increase or a decrease
in the abortion rate, we must know the number of abortions performed
on women who have left the state's welfare rolls.  If the cap
encouraged them to become self-sufficient or to seek alternative
means of support for their babies -- as the framers of the policy
intended -- the abortion rate for former welfare mothers may very
well have decreased.  And the total number of abortions in New
Jersey may have declined.  If that proves to be the case, in a
state that provides public funding for abortions, we will have
powerful evidence to predict that the family cap will be actively
anti-abortion in a state that does not fund or otherwise encourage
abortion.    
<P>
Family Research Council, however,  has never maintained that the
legitimacy of the family cap depends on its capacity to reduce
abortions over the short-term.  The current welfare system is
indelibly anti-marital and anti-natal -- peacefully coexisting
with the world's highest abortion rates outside the Eastern Bloc.
 Long-term change may entail some risk of short-term harm, but
the cost of reform must be weighed against the moral cost of perpetuating
a system that destroys the lives of both the born and yet unborn.
<P>
The family cap is the only welfare reform initiative in the Senate
debate that will directly reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which
is strongly correlated with abortion.  Ardent support for the
family cap <I>is</I> the pro-life position because marriage is
the best protection for children both before and after birth.
 Paying women not to have abortions, by contrast, is morally corrupt.

A study of fruit flies by National Institutes of Health scientists
has rekindled the debate over whether homosexuality has a genetic
component. 
<P>
A set of male fruit flies, the study reports, formed mating chains
with each other after their body chemistry was altered.  But a
close look at the study reveals that the most reasonable conclusions
from the evidence are that male and female sex drives are quite
different, and that frenzied males, under certain conditions,
will mate with anything, even other males. 
<P>
Writing in the June 1995 <I>Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences</I>, Shang-Ding Zhang and Ward F. Odenwald of the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke division
of the National Institutes of Health report a heightening of the
sexual activities of fruit flies that had been heat-treated to
reduce levels of the chemical serotonin.[1] Reduction of serotonin
has been linked in other studies to an increase in sexual activity
and same-sex coupling among some animals (rats, cats, and rabbits).[2]

<P>
Media reports, predictably, have exaggerated the actual findings
of the research.  <I>Time,</I> for instance, reported that the
new study &quot;adds to the mounting evidence that homosexuality
has genetic origins....&quot;[3]
<P>
The <I>Time</I> article and other media reports ignore or underreport
key elements of the study that work against the claim that homosexuality
may be hereditary or even partly hereditary.  One finding was
that altered females, the study notes, were not affected in any
discernible way.  
<P>
Another finding -- that normal males resisted sexual advances
by the altered males for up to two hours and then succumbed to
same-sex activity -- indicates strongly that homosexual behavior
is environmentally induced. 
<P>
From the study:
<P>
&quot;At the beginning of chaining periods, in bottles containing
[more than] 80 percent transformants [treated flies], nontransformant
males were observed only at 
the head of fast moving chains where they repeatedly displayed
repelling signals to advancing suitors -- i.e. wing-flicking,
face-kicking, and/or running away....After a 2-hr. exposure to
vigorous transformant courtship, many, if not all, of the nontransformants
were observed courting and inducing courtship.&quot;[4]
<P>
In bottles in which females were present, the females formed defensive
clusters, impeding males' efforts to mate with them.  In one jar
pictured in the article, the females were huddled at the very
bottom while the males formed long lines of sexual activity in
the rest of the jar.  Some of the males did mate with the females,
but the females offered resistance.  
<P>
As the study explains: 
<P>
&quot;Lead males would typically break off their heterosexual
advances after experiencing one or more of her repelling signals...such
as kicking his face and/or running or flying away.  During vigorous
chaining periods, females predominantly grouped together in tight
clusters; however, no female-female courtship was observed in
or outside of these dense packs.&quot;[5]
<P>
The male &quot;homosexual&quot; activity might have had little
to do with preference and merely involve frenzied mating with
the nearest available partner.
<P>
But listen to how <I>Time</I> magazine summarizes the participation
by the &quot;straight&quot; males:
<P>
&quot;While the gays formed their conga lines, the straights stayed
to the side -- but only temporarily.  After a few hours, the straights
joined in and, for the time being, acted gay.&quot;[6]
<P>
No mention is made by <I>Time</I> of the struggle by the &quot;straight&quot;
flies to ward off the hypersexual males.  And the use of the word
&quot;gay&quot; to describe the flies gives them anthropomorphic
overtones; that is, the writer attributes human characteristics
to a non-human rather than vice-versa.  But the notion of being
&quot;gay&quot; is a calculated construct of self-identification
for political purposes.  Many people struggling with homosexuality
reject the idea that their defining characteristic is to be &quot;gay.&quot;[7]
 The <I>Time</I> article does concede that &quot;[t]he type of
gene they've been studying in fruit flies could not begin to account
for the complex variations in human homosexual behavior.  For
one thing, the gene does not cause flies to renounce heterosexuality
altogether.  If a 'gay' fly is surrounded by females instead of
males, he'll fertilize the lady flies.&quot;[8]
<P>
Another culturally significant fact from the study is that when
non-treated male flies constituted 50 percent or more of the population
in a bottle, the researchers found that &quot;little or no chaining
was detected and nontransformant participation was rarely observed.&quot;[9]
<P>
In other words, when the bottle's &quot;culture&quot; was at least
half normal, the male-to-male sex occurred not at all or rarely.
 But when the normal flies were surrounded by &quot;homosexual&quot;
flies and attacked repeatedly, they finally gave in to the behavior.
 Again, it is perilous to extrapolate insect studies to humans,
but this sounds much like experiences reported among convicts.
 Otherwise sexually normal prison inmates sometimes indulge in
homosexual behavior, not because of genetics but because of the
immediate environment (coercion, lack of opposite-sex partners,
peer acceptance of the behavior).  According to psychiatrist and
author Jeffrey B. Satinover, &quot;It is common knowledge that
when some heterosexual men are placed in isolation for long periods
of time with each other that they will engage in homosexual behavior.
 But, once released, they will resume their heterosexual behavior.&quot;[10]
<P>
The social sciences are increasingly looking to animals or insects
for clues to human behavior, even though human sexuality is quite
different.  But if any lessons are to be drawn for human purposes,
they might be these:
<P>
<LI>  The sexes are quite different in their sexual needs, drives
and reactions to particular stimulants.
<P>
<LI>  A culture that hopes to maintain its sexual norms is at risk
when a critical mass of deviant behavior occurs.
<P>
 <LI> Homosexual behavior is learned, and occurs among those who are
vulnerable to the environmental factors that tend to produce homosexual
behavior. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As with other studies purporting to show a genetic link to homosexuality,
the NIH study is being hailed by homosexual activists, who are
trying to equate homosexuality with an immutable characteristic
such as skin color or ethnic origin in their drive to create support
for an entirely new category of behavior-based special civil rights.
<P>
The actual research often reveals something entirely different
from what is claimed.  Researchers Zhang and Odenwald summarize
that &quot;both genetic and environmental factors play a role
in male sexual behavior[11]....elements of the basic machinery controlling
male sexual behavior may be highly conserved between taxonomically
distinct organisms.&quot;[12] They call for more research on the
topic to &quot;enhance our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms
controlling sexual behavior.&quot;[13]
<P>
The study is interesting.  But it gives no hard evidence of anything
other than the fact that male fruit flies subjected to a sexual
stimulant may mate with anything in sight.  In March 1993, two
Columbia University psychiatrists examined the various studies
purporting to find a homosexual biologic component.   They concluded
that &quot;there is no evidence at present to substantiate a biologic
theory...the appeal of current biologic explanations for sexual
orientation may derive more from dissatisfaction with the present
status of psychosocial explanations than from a substantiating
body of experimental data.&quot;[14]
<P>
In other words, politics, not science, is driving the debate.
 An honest look at the evidence of 70 years of psychology, therapeutic
research, the history of the entire human race, and the moral
codes of all the great civilizations tells us that homosexuality
is not only universally discouraged as learned behavior but can
also be temporary, controlled, or even changed.
<P>
Given the well-documented, socially and medically destructive
effects of homosexual behavior on individuals, families and communities,
compassion and prudence should lead us to discourage any cultural
promotion of homosexuality as a moral and normal activity.  Media
reports indicate that homosexual experimentation among high schoolers
has increased considerably in recent years as schools have presented
homosexual activity as normal, desirable and even &quot;cool.&quot;[15]
 Sexually vulnerable young people are being steered onto a behavioral
path that they and their families will sorely regret and which
will even cost some of them their lives at an early age.
<P>
Homosexual behavior, like other destructive vices, can be learned
-- and unlearned.  Under no circumstances should it be promoted,
particularly through misrepresentation of scientific studies.

<P>
Federal arts funding, much like the welfare system, has created
a class of beneficiaries who are hostile to conservative, pro-family
causes.  Recipients of federal aid all too often become cheerleaders
for big government, the family's natural enemy.  Big government
strips families of their incomes through confiscatory taxation
and diminishes their autonomy through intrusive social welfare
and educational programs designed to wean children from their
parents (and parental values) at earlier and earlier ages. 
<P>
The same taxpayers who suffer the indignity of seeing their own
earnings used by bureaucrats to undermine their families also
pay for a federally-subsidized artistic and media elite to cheer
on their tormentors: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
<P>
It is long past time that the federal arts and humanities endowments
be de-authorized and de-funded.  Spawned during the 1960s' Great
Society years, these agencies, despite whatever good they have
done, have damaged American culture, ripped off the taxpayer,
waged war on the family and religion, and politicized the academy
and the arts.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO TRIM THE ENDOWMENTS ARE ILL-ADVISED AND
COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Merely cutting the budgets and stretching out the life of the
agencies will cause more mischief.  When Proposition 13 was enacted
into law in California, hostile government officials began cutting
back on essentials, such as police and fire departments, leaving
the waste and fat untouched.  The object lesson to the voters
was that challenging government growth meant the onset of anarchy.
 Similarly, if the federal budgets for public broadcasting and
the arts and humanities are merely reduced, the truly offensive
offerings will be the last to be de-funded.  Vengeful bureaucrats
will trim where it will cause the most pain and where patrons
would complain most loudly.  A couple of years ago, when Congress
stalled in passing an appropriations bill for the federal government,
the Smithsonian closed its 
doors, as did some national parklands, enraging taxpaying visitors.
 But the long-obsolete federal Helium Reserve suffered no loss
of gas.  Again, the message to the voters was:  we will punish
you if you don't lobby your elected representatives to reinstate
our funding -- with increases. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SOME POLITICIANS THINK THEY CAN BUY PEACE BY APPEASING THEIR
OPPONENT. INSTEAD, THEY CREATE A HARDENED ENEMY.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In terms of the federal endowments, the political price is actually
higher for merely cutting instead of eliminating them.  Recipients
of federal aid are the natural foes of budget cutters and will
continue to use their taxpayer-provided subsidies to wage political
war on them.  Hundreds of arts organizations are being lobbied
to bring pressure on individual members of Congress to preserve
art pork in their own districts.
<P>
A case in point is a letter from Independent Television Service
Executive Director James Yee to public broadcasting advocates.
 The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore, in no way independent)
ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new programming for public
broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent colleagues&quot;
to &quot;become involved in future efforts to drum up support
for public broadcasting, especially with your local and national
elected officials....&quot;  Yee warns that &quot;an extensive
informational outreach campaign will have to be waged.&quot; 
Such campaigns cost money, but are easier to mount when federal
subsidies pour in to handle other costs.  
<P>
The current House plan to phase out the endowments serves only
to give welfare artists some time to restore their subsidies.
 Indeed, subsidy supporters have acknowledged, through their accord,
that the phase-out plan is their best hope for saving the agencies
and returning to business as usual.[1] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CUTTING BACK THE ENDOWMENTS WILL NOT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REFORM.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Congress repeatedly has slapped NEA on the wrist, and still the
NEA sends money to The Kitchen, Franklin Furnace and other centers
of blatantly offensive &quot;performance&quot; art that denigrates
religion, families and traditional morality.  Indeed, a <I>Washington
Post</I> critic observed recently that the 1993 Biennial Exhibition
at the NEA-funded Whitney Museum was &quot;one long whinging [sic]
whine of political correctness, suggesting as it did that the
only art that counts is art produced by lesbians, inhabitants
of barrios, sufferers of AIDS and others on the margin.&quot;
 Two years later, at the 1995 Biennial, &quot;[h]omosexuality's
still hot, especially the kinds involving punctures of the flesh,
accessories of leather, bondage and cross-dressing, but so too
are the subtlest of painterly abstraction.  Nuances and nipple-rings
are both themes of this exhibit, if it can be said to have any
themes at all.&quot;[2]
<P>
NEA chairwoman Jane Alexander has boasted of using the endowment
to promote homosexual themes[3] and has even defended a public bloodletting
by an HIV-infected  performer at an NEA-subsidized venue.[4]  Despite
many assurances by past and present NEA officials that excellence
and artistic merit are the criteria for grant allocation, this
is clearly not the case.  More than $9 billion in private giving
sustains arts in communities all over America.[5] The NEA's $175
million is important more for its symbolism than for the actual
dollars involved.  An NEA grant validates an artist, and the government
should not be putting its imprimatur on much of the anti-family,
anti-religious propaganda that counter-culture activists brazenly
categorize as art.  The entertainment industry has revenues in
the tens of billions of dollars  each year.  Time-Warner alone
took in $15.9 billion during 1994.  Clearly, Hollywood is in a
better position to subsidize the endowments for arts and humanities
than US taxpayers who struggling to get out from under $200 billion
in annual deficits.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting
Act creating CPB.  The agency oversees the Public Broadcasting
Service, which was formed in 1969, a year before the creation
of National Public Radio.  CPB's total appropriation in fiscal
1969 was $5 million.  In 1992, Congress re-authorized CPB with
a three-year, $1.1 billion appropriation.  By 1993, CPB's annual
federal appropriation was $318.6 million, which rose to $386 million
for fiscal 1995.  There are 349 public TV stations and 200 TV
grantees receiving CPB funding.[6]  PBS claims to reach 1.8 million
teachers and 29.5 million students through educational programming
and services, and 97 million Americans overall each week with
some PBS programming.[7] National Public Radio is carried on 595
stations, and CPB awards money to 391 public radio grantees. 
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars annually.[8]
 Yet the shows that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be
the very programs that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame
Street</I>, <I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
<P>
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  (For detailed examples, see FRC's Policy paper entitled
&quot;Public Broadcasting?  Let's Free Big Bird.&quot;)
<P>
<CENTER><H3> NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEA was established in 1965 when President Johnson signed the
National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, which also
created the National Endowment for the Humanities.  NEA's initial
budget was $2.5 million, but grew over the years to about $175
million annually (fiscal 1995 appropriation is $167.7 million).
 A fiscal 1995 rescission bill, HR 1158, would reduce 1995 funding
to $162.5 million.[9] All told, NEA has spent more than $3 billion
of tax money in its 30-year history.   
<P>
The plan approved by the House Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee on May 10, 1995 would reauthorize NEA through fiscal
1998 but eliminate funding in fiscal 1999.  Funding would be reduced
by 40 percent in fiscal 1996, another 40 percent in fiscal 1997
and by 20 percent in fiscal 1998. The NEA would get no money in
fiscal 1999.[10]
<P>
NEA would also face a $5 million cap on administrative expenses,
which would entail an 80 percent reduction in budget for staff.
 Currently, NEA spends $24 million annually on administration.[11]
<P>
Beginning in 1996, grants to individuals would be eliminated,
with all grants going to institutions.  Eighty percent of annual
appropriations to the state art councils would be in the form
of block grants.[12]
<P>
A Senate bill (S 856) introduced by James Jeffords (R-VT) and
co-sponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), Alan Simpson (R-WY), Edward
Kennedy (D-MA) and Claiborne Pell (D-RI) would reauthorize NEA
for five years (FY 1996-2000) at gradually reduced funding levels.
 Forty percent of the NEA's program budget would go to &quot;partnership&quot;
grants with the states, local and regional groups; 40% more would
go toward organizations of &quot;national significance;&quot;
a final 20% would go to direct grants to organizations, such as
theaters or museums, and to individual artists. 
<P>
Most significantly, the bill keeps intact much of the current
peer review system, in which panelists award federal tax dollars
to their friends and associates.  It also locks in place the conditions
under which the NEA would reject a grant over &quot;obscenity.&quot;
 An artwork would have to be found legally obscene in a court
of law before the NEA could move to recover funds.  Given that
a grant from the NEA automatically gives an artwork &quot;artistic&quot;
significance no matter how offensive, the provision is meaningless
in terms of curbing abuses of taxpayer funding.  
<P>
The bill also directs the current NEA director to give &quot;Distinguished
Lifetime Service for the Arts&quot; awards to &quot;each of the
former Chairpersons of the Endowment.&quot;  This means that federal
taxpayers would honor, among others, John Frohnmayer, the NEA
chief whose tenure ended when he was forced by President Bush
to resign over NEA's continued funding of anti-Christian and pornographic
works. 
<P>
Finally, the bill creates an entirely new federal agency to nationalize
standards for all public libraries and museums.  The &quot;Institute
for Museum and Library Services&quot; would be authorized for
five years, beginning with a budget of $75 million in fiscal 1996
&quot;and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding
fiscal years,&quot; and would have grant-making authority.  This
is a potentially lucrative source to be abused by well-connected
left-wing groups like the American Library Association, would
give the federal government potential control over the nation's
local public libraries, and would do to libraries and museums
what the NEA has done to art -- redefine it using federal tax
dollars to further a radical cultural and political agenda. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEH was established at the same time NEA was born, in 1965.  The
fiscal year 1966 budget was $5.9 million, and the agency had a
staff of 13.[13] The agency expanded over the years until it reached
a budget of $177 million in fiscal 1995.  
<P>
Officials at the NEH are hardly contrite for sponsoring a widely-denounced
set of national history standards that, among other things, emphasize
the role of the Ku Klux Klan (17 references) and exalt Soviet
advances in space while ignoring Albert Einstein, the Wright Brothers,
Paul Revere, Robert E. Lee and the American moon landing.[14] The
NEH also specializes in promoting cultural relativism, feminist
studies and other Marxist and neo-Marxist theoretical quagmires
on the nation's campuses.[15]
<P>
The current plan approved by the House Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee would reauthorize NEH with an annual 20
percent funding reduction through fiscal 1998 starting with the
1995 appropriation of $172 million (which includes a recent House-approved
$5 million rescission).  No funding would be allocated to NEH
in 1999.  The 5 percent cap for administrative expenses would
also apply to NEH, as well as the termination of direct federal
grants to individuals (scholars would continue to receive grants
through recipient organizations such as universities).  Eighty
percent of appropriations would go to state humanities councils
in the form of block grants.  Senate bill S 856 would reauthorize
NEH for five years at gradually reduced funding levels, beginning
with $168.6 million in fiscal year 1996.  Each state would get
a minimum of $200,000 in funding each fiscal year.  Grants would
continue to be made to &quot;groups, individuals, and State agencies
or entities.&quot;

<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Attempts to curry favor with the welfare broadcast media and arts
groups are useless and only embolden the political enemies of
budget cutters.  So, we must ask budget-cutting Members of Congress:
why give the very people who will never love you enough subsidies
to stay in business so they can continue taking shots at you?
 The federal arts subsidies must end once and for all.

THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD SUMMIT FOR<br>
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT TAKES ON THE FAMILY</h2>

What follows is a commentary on the &quot;Draft Declaration and
Draft Programme of Action&quot; prepared by United Nations staff
for the &quot;World Summit for Social Development&quot; scheduled to
occur in Copenhagen March 6-12, 1995.  This commentary is indicative
of problems found in the document, which runs some 55 pages in
typescript, and which addresses, in generally broad language,
a wide range of social issues and concerns in member countries
of the United Nations.  This commentary will be updated after
Copenhagen to discuss the final language of the Declaration and
Programme of Action.    
<P>
<center><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></center>
<P>
Following the United Nations and its swamp of commissions, declarations,
and conferences can be a debilitating experience.  The situation
is compounded by the rapidly growing basket of UN documents and
observances devoted to such topics as the family (International
Year of the Family, 1994), population and development (International
Conference on Population and Development, 1994), social development
(World Summit for Social Development, 1995), and women (Fourth
World Conference on Women, 1995).    
<P>
Thematically and administratively separate, these observances
and conferences tend to overlap in subject matter.  This is due
in part to the ambiguity of mission in many UN agencies and documents,
and the tendency of recent UN meetings to produce &quot;smorgasbord&quot;
documents that say in 1,000 words what more succinct documents
(like those of the American founding) say in 10.  Thus, for example,
the bitter dispute over abortion at the ICPD in Cairo in 1994
is likely to be reprised at the Beijing women's conference and
its preliminary meetings.              
<P>
An additional factor promoting these disputes is the continued
presence and agitation within the UN structure of international
lobbies (some with economic ties to the UN, and others privately
funded) devoted to particular agendas.  The United Nations Charter
(for example, Chapter X, Article 71, relating to the Economic
and  Social Council) makes specific provision for consultation
by the UN and its constituent councils and agencies &quot;with
nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] which are concerned with
matters within its competence.&quot;  
<P>
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is responsible for conducting
all events in connection with the World Summit for Social Development.
<P>
NGOs vary in the amount and type of energy they devote to UN activities.
 Essentially, they  are private, charitable (i.e., tax exempt)
or advocacy organizations that are accredited by the UN  to lobby
at particular conferences and the preparatory meetings leading
up to them.  In the context of Cairo and Beijing, NGOs such as
the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)  and the
Women's Environmental and Developmental Organization (WEDO) have
exerted continuous pressure, with considerable internal UN support,
for the drafting of documents that  strongly endorse abortion,
the redefinition of the family, and other radical causes.    
<P>
Preparatory meetings leading up to designated international conferences
are called, in UN lingo, &quot;prepcoms.&quot;  Major prepcoms
for both the Cairo population conference and the Beijing women's
summit have been held months in advance at the United Nations
headquarters in New York.  The prepcoms are run by &quot;Preparatory
Committees,&quot; composed of representatives of member nations
of the UN.  In between sessions of the prepcom, the Committee
chairman, with  the assistance of the UN Secretariat, may be tasked
with such responsibilities as the drafting of  declarations and
programmes of action.  The periods between prepcoms are invaluable,
especially to New Yorkbased NGOs, as opportunities to lobby UN
officials and to influence the development of conference documents.
<P>
With respect to the World Summit for Social Development, a second
session of the prepcom  was held in New York from August 22 to
September 2, 1994.  At that session, the committee  tasked its
chairman to prepare a declaration for consideration in Copenhagen.
 The UN Secretariat was charged by the committee to prepare a
programme of action for Copenhagen.  The analysis that follows
discusses the draft declaration and programme of action of November
22, 1994, as prepared by the chairman and the Secretariat.  As
of this writing, a final draft is in the process of  being completed
for submission to the summit in Copenhagen.    
<P>
That the United Nations is an incessant document mill has become
increasingly obvious.  The  November 22 draft, as discussed below,
incorporates a wealth of vague and contradictory ideas,  not the
least of which is the situational irony of a massive United Nations
bureaucracy proclaiming itself the savior of decentralized government.
 But, the question may be asked, are not most UN documents merely
recommendations, without the force of law?  Indeed, the design
of the  Economic and Social Council announced in the UN Charter
is precisely that of a body constituted to hold meetings and make
recommendations.  Article 62 defines the powers of ECOSOC as 
follows:                 
<P>
1.  The Economic and Social Council may make or initiate studies
and reports with respect to international economic, social, cultural,
educational, health, and related matters and may make recommendations
with respect to any such matters to the General Assembly, to the
Members of the United Nations, and to the specialized (UN) agencies
concerned.                  
<P>
2.  [ECOSOC] may make recommendations for the purpose of promoting
respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms
for all.                  
<P>
3.  [ECOSOC] may prepare draft conventions for submission to the
General Assembly ...      
<P>
4.  [ECOSOC] may call, in accordance with rules prescribed by
the United Nations, international conferences on matters falling
within its competence.  This brief Article summarizes the activity
of the ECOSOC with respect to the World Summit  for Social Development
 with one exception.  That is, none of the documents of the Summit
 amount to a convention, a legal instrument that requires the
approval of the General Assembly  and the submission to members
states for ratification.  Examples of such conventions are the
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention for the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  It
is important to realize that the language developed at Copenhagen
for its nonbinding declaration and programme of action will thereby
acquire momentum within the UN system, and perhaps form the basis
for future conventions with potentially legally binding force.
<P>
<center><h3>WEDO AND THE GLEN COVE CONCLAVE</h3></center>
<P>
It is this possibility that motivates the activities of the most
intensely involved NGOs, such as  the Women's Environmental and
Development Organization (WEDO).  Former Democratic Congresswoman
Bella Abzug, a privatecitizen member of the US delegation to the
Cairo population conference, is the leader of WEDO.  An uncompromising
feminist and abortion advocate, Abzug  represented WEDO at a November
29 to December 2, 1994 planning meeting for the Beijing women's
conference.  This global strategy meeting was held in Glen Cove,
New York.  While  focused primarily on Beijing, the meeting included
working groups focused on devising strategies and language for
the whole basket of UN conferences and documents in progress.
 In that context, many of its recommendations are instructive.
<P>
The Glen Cove working group on the Copenhagen document criticized
it for its focus &quot;on the  family as the basic unit&quot;
of society, and for overlooking &quot;the changing configuration
of the  family.&quot;  The working group called for women's housework
to be remunerated, for a &quot;universal  adequate annual guaranteed
income,&quot; and &quot;payment for childcare.&quot;  It also
called for the adoption of a tax on &quot;international financial
transactions&quot; and &quot;taxation of transnational corporations&quot;
to  finance social development, presumably under UN auspices.
 (In this regard, the November 22 Copenhagen draft recommends
that the General Assembly task the ECOSOC to study such  proposals.)
<P>
The working group proposed a number of changes to the Copenhagen
draft (See full text of  the November 22 draft in the Appendix).
 The changes include a subtle call for changes in electoral systems
to establish a &quot;mechanism for women's ... equitable representation
at all levels of  the political process.&quot;  Other language
developed at Glen Cove suggests this &quot;mechanism&quot; would
 include gender quotas for public office.  In addition, the working
group proposed that the  Copenhagen document ensure &quot;that
effective laws and agencies exist to prevent and eliminate  discrimination
on the basis of gender [and] sexual orientation ...&quot;; &quot;that
women and adolescents  have access to good quality, comprehensive
health care, including the full range of reproductive  and sexual
health care services, including access to safe abortion ...&quot;;
and that the draft's  language regarding &quot;family as the basic
unit of society&quot; be replaced with references to &quot;households
and families&quot; as &quot;important economic units.&quot;  
<P>
The Glen Cove working group recommendations for Beijing are also
revealing.  The group  called for the &quot;recognition of sexual
orientation as a fundamental human right within the context  of
the expanding definition of the family.&quot;  It also called
for &quot;sexual and reproductive education to [sic] boys and
girls&quot;; affirmative action to assure that &quot;governments
... achieve 50% representation in elected and appointed office
by women by the year 2005,&quot; to be achieved by &quot;setting
 targets or quota systems&quot;; and encouraging &quot;activities
aimed at changing traditional decisionmaking roles in the family.&quot;
 One specific action recommended by the working group is that
the UN Secretariat prepare a &quot;gender balance rating card&quot;
to be published at the beginning of each session of the General
Assembly &quot;rating and ranking Member States on the basis of
numbers, positions, titles, race and ethnicity of women participating
in their Missions to [the] UN ...&quot;      
<P>
Other working groups dealt with the aftermath of the Cairo population
conference and discussed ways to expand the advances made in promoting
the notion of &quot;reproductive health and  decisionmaking&quot;
as aspects of fundamental human rights, including possibly adolescents
and  single people.  The goal remains to assure that abortion
is included in future UN documents &quot;as a  basic method of
fertility regulation and as an essential part of reproductive
health services and  rights.&quot;    
<P>
Finally, Working Group 2 at Glen Cove developed a program of lobbying
and other activities  to be undertaken between the Copenhagen
and Beijing meetings.  The program is entitled the  &quot;Women's
Global Campaign, 180 Days, 180 Ways.&quot;  The campaign's goal
is to extend the statements of belief and programs of action of
the Glen Cove coalition to a wider network of women,  NGOs and
&quot;disenfranchised people.&quot;  Expanded usage of online
computer networks is  envisioned.  All of this is in keeping with
a recognition that the topdown organization of social  movements
by such bodies as the United Nations are doomed to failure if
it cannot enlist the  support of a grassroots movement in member
nations.                                      
<P>
The Glen Cove conclave amounted to a gathering of radical feminists
rebuffed politically in the  United States but rewarded in the
closed environment of New York and the United Nations,  funded
and supported by a variety of such populist funding sources as
the Ford, and Rockefeller  Foundations, and abetted by the swelling
throng of UN and Clinton Administration bureaucrats  dedicated
to adopting the sexual revolution on a global scale.  With each
new UN conference and  document, they have another opportunity
to move the international clock in the direction of their  Brave
New World.    
<P>
<center><h3>ANALYSIS OF NOVEMBER 22 COPENHAGEN DRAFT</h3></center>
<P>
All page numbers refer to the November 22, 1994 draft declaration
and &quot;programme of  action.&quot;  The actual text of the
draft declaration reviewed begins on page 3 and concludes at page
 55.  Most paragraphs in the declaration are identifiable by numbers
or letter designations in the  text, and these designations are
used in this commentary.  Language that is objectionable is  indicated
by brackets [ ].  Language to be added or substituted for objectionable
language is indicated in bold.    
<P>
Suggested modifications follow.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 2.  Modify line two to read &quot;profound social
problems specially poverty,  unemployment, family breakup and
social exclusion.&quot;  The phenomenon of family dissolution
is  a virtually universal concomitant of development; indeed,
it is especially pronounced in the most highly developed nations
as individuals tend to supplant family (agrarian) units as the
primary  sources of production.  Asserting the problem of family
breakup at the outset of the document  will serve to buttress
family preservation as an essential component of development throughout
 the declaration.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 4.  &quot;Peace and security&quot; are insufficient
descriptors of national aspirations.   This paragraph should be
modified to read &quot;the achievement and maintenance of conditions
of  freedom, peace and security with and between ... cannot be
attained in the absence of conditions of freedom, peace and security.&quot;
 This language is needed to express the basic condition  of political
freedom as the key to economic and human progress.  Conditions
of &quot;peace and  security,&quot; at least in the military sense,
prevailed in Soviet Russia and numerous authoritarian  regimes
of East Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  Peace and security alone
are insufficient conditions for human wellbeing and development.
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 11, line 2.  The word &quot;contradiction&quot;
should be modified to read &quot;contrast.&quot;  This distinction
may not carry over well in other languages besides English, but
it is important that the document not be read to assert that in
every case the expansion of prosperity occurs for some at the
expense of the poverty of others.   All wealth is not the product
of exploitation.  Were it so, development by definition would
be a zero sum game in which no real improvement in overall global
living standards is possible.  The declaration must reject this
notion in principle. &quot;Contrast&quot; better suggests the
morally troubling existence of stark inequities in the distribution
of the world's basic resources.    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 12, line 3,  The word &quot;people&quot; or
&quot;peoples&quot; appears to be missing after  &quot;Globalization
also permits.&quot;    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 14, subparagraph a, line 2, add the following
language:  &quot;the gap between rich and poor, aggravated by
cultural factors and social mores, has increased.&quot;  This
addition recognizes that the economic gap between rich and poor
is not purely an economic phenomenon. In the United States, for
example, families headed by a single parent are five times more
likely to be poor than are families headed by two parents.  Casual
attitudes regarding divorce and sexual activity outside of marriage
have fueled these inequities.    
<P>
Page 6, paragraph (h).  Language is needed here to suggest, as
economically as possible, that &quot;family,&quot; while expressed
in different cultural and legal terms in many countries, nonetheless
has an archetypal and crosscultural meaning.  If we can speak
of &quot;equity and equality&quot; between men and women at various
points in the document, we can also make clear that the family
is an archetypal arrangement of man and woman, and their offspring,
and others related to them by  blood, marriage and adoption. 
<P>
Page 7, paragraph 21.  This paragraph needs to be strengthened
to include recognition of due  principles of subsidiarity and
of the possibility that government, even when wellmeaning, may
 overreach and become the principal obstacle to the attainment
of development.  Thus, language  should be added which states:
 We acknowledge the [primary] special responsibility of  governments,
particularly those units of government closest to and most accountable
to the  people, to attain these goals.  We also acknowledge that
they cannot be achieved by government  alone, and that, indeed,
governments may hinder development by overinvolvement in and 
disruption of healthy social and economic activity.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.  Modify to read:  &quot;the
provision of primary health care  and the promotion of reproductive
health and voluntary and informed family planning for  married
couples, reinforcement of the social and legal significance of
the archetypal family unit, safe drinking water ...&quot;  Addition
of &quot;voluntary&quot; is necessary to affirm the right of couples
to reject the &quot;provision&quot; of family planning; reference
to the marital couple is a natural correlative  of the term &quot;family&quot;
in family planning.  The role of the dissolution of the family
in fostering  intractable poverty is described above.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph c.  &quot;access to land, credit&quot;
should be modified to read  &quot;opportunity to acquire land,
credit ...&quot;  The emphasis must be on expanded opportunities,
and  the United Nations should make clear that it is not endorsing
policies of expropriation and confiscation of lawfully acquired
and owned resources.                                        
<P>
Page 9, commitment 4, subparagraph a.  &quot;Promote basic values
of respect for pluralism and  diversity, tolerance and responsibility,
political and personal freedom, nonviolence and solidarity ...&quot;
<P>
Page 10, commitment 4, subparagraph e:  &quot;central role of
the archetypal family.&quot; 
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph b:  &quot;Establish policies
[objectives and measurable goals] to  enhance gender balance.&quot;
 This language clearly stipulates the formulation of quotas for
political representation of women, presumably created and enforced
by the United Nations and its instrumentalities.  As such, this
language is at war with the declaration's expressed commitment
to respect for national sovereignty and decentralization of developmental
initiatives.  Moreover, it is  false in principle.  The key to
equity and equality is opportunity.  Government policies should
 indeed guarantee such opportunities, and those governments that
do so will reap the richest rewards in diverse and freely chosen
representation.  Republican forms of government are incompatible
with quotas, and republican forms are precisely those that have
proven most resilient in  expanding political participation by
all citizens.    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph c.  In this context, there
is no reason to exclude men from protections against &quot;exploitation,
abuse and violence.&quot;  Violence against entrepreneurs in the
 United States, for example, frequently takes the form of attacks
upon disfavored ethnic groups  engaged in lawful business activity
in the cities.  Prejudice and violence against citizens of foreign
extraction is also common in many countries.  Both of these types
of phenomena are severe hindrances to the development of small
enterprises in economically depressed communities.  The selective
nature of much of this violence against men certifies it as an
issue of equity and equality.  Therefore, the subparagraph should
read:  &quot;Take effective measures to eliminate all kinds of
 exploitation, abuse and violence against men and women, with
particular attention to  immigrants, [women] refugees, and [women]
noncombatants in situations of armed conflict.&quot;    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph d.  &quot;Encourage the ratification,
[removal of reservations,]  and implementation of all provisions
...&quot;  The United Nations is to be expected to encourage the
 ratification of international instruments approved by the General
Assembly.  Reservations, however, are a critical mechanism by
which sovereign nations adduce understandings that protect  important
cultural and legal values and policies.  In this particular regard,
reservations in many  nations preserve understandings regarding
special protections for women and mothers, and for  their offspring,
born and unborn.  The language as written is once again at war
with the declaration's commitment to respect national sovereignty.
 It is intrusive and should be modified as noted.    
<P>
Page 11, subparagraph d.  &quot;Increase official development
assistance, both in total and for social  programs, without coercion
or reducing the resources allocated to other sectors.&quot;  This
language is needed to address the continuing problem of assistance
linkage:  the withholding or threatened withholding of assistance
funds from nations which do not conform national policies to donor
nation's preferences in such areas as population control.  Addition
of coercion or reinforces the declaration's commitment to national
sovereignty.    
<P>
Page 11, commitment 7, subparagraph a.  &quot;Protect basic social
programs and expenditures, in  particular, those affecting the
weakest and most vulnerable segments of society, from acrosstheboard
budget reductions, while eliminating inefficient spending and
perverse incentives against work and family formation, and increasing
the quality of social expenditures.&quot;    
<P>
Page 12, commitment 8, subparagraph d.  &quot;Ensure that taxation
systems are fair, [and] economically efficient, and nonpunitive,&quot;
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 4.  &quot;Social development is also clearly
linked to the development of peace, freedom, stability and security
...  to promote social development requires a reorientation of
values, objectives, and priorities, in order to strengthen or
reform existing institutions and  policies.  Human dignity, [equity]
equal opportunity, freedom  and social justice must be ...&quot;
 The rationale for each of these suggested changes is outlined
in similar contexts above.  Note that the strengthening of all
existing institutions should clearly not be the objective of the
United  Nations in this declaration.  Many national institutions,
both private and public are, in fact,  destructive of human wellbeing.
 The declaration itself calls for reform of multilateral lending
 policies to the most debtridden nations.  No one, for example,
should support strengthening of  the UNFPA, which has exhibited
warm relations with national governments employing population
policies deeply destructive of human life and human freedom. 
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 5.  &quot;This same global community is threatened
by environmental degradation, epidemics, various forms of intolerance,
attacks and stresses upon the archetypal family unit, sexual exploitation
and the drug trade, violence and criminality . . . &quot;    
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 7.  &quot;Gender equity and equality of opportunity
[and the full participation of  women] in all economic, social
and political activities is essential.&quot;  Besides being redundant
as  written, this phrase could be abused to discourage governmental
policies that protect full or parttime homemakers and that permit
them to freely choose the terms of their participation in  economic
and other activities.  The right of families to establish their
own patterns of workfamily  involvement must be affirmed.  Another
alternative here is to change the word &quot;full&quot; to &quot;open.&quot;
  Ask yourself this question:  which nation of the world has the
fullest participation of women in  economic activities?  Clearly,
it is the People's Republic of China, with its cadres and worker
 brigades.  Free nations typically exhibit much more diverse and
complex arrangements, with equality of opportunity guaranteed
and norms of participation left to individual and family choice
and capability.  This is the more socially just and free condition.
<P>
Page 17, bulleted items:  Add &quot;a strengthened role for the
archetypal family, churches and  private associations for selfbetterment;&quot;
and &quot;public policies that discourage illegal and/or  selfdestructive
behaviors that shorten lifespan and/or reduce productivity.&quot;
 The latter  language should be unexceptionable; it is aimed at
such practices as smoking, drug abuse, and  activities that transmit
HIV and other diseases.  The impact of these factors on human
lifespan, productivity, and development is clearly massive.  
 
<P>
Page 18, paragraph 11, add a subparagraph e:  Promoting the expansion
of political freedom in the context of transitions to market economies,
and directing development assistance to smallscale and private
ventures that maximize individual creativity and initiative. 
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph e:  &quot;... and ensuring
that subsidy systems benefit people in  poverty, avoid incentives
to nonproductive lifestyles and family breakup, and reduce disparities.&quot;
As noted above, family breakup is a key determinant and perpetuator
of poverty; subsidy  (welfare) programs should avoid designs that
punish intact families and reward illegitimacy.    
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph g:  &quot;Assisting developing
canters and countries in transition to establish efficient, nonpunitive
and fair tax collection systems.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph a:  &quot;Ensuring that institutions
 public, private, and  natural, including the family unit  and
agencies responsible for the design and implementation ...&quot;
 This language eliminates any possible bias toward governmental
institutions as  opposed to private and natural institutions engaged
in critical social development, primarily the family, business,
and religious denominations.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
transparency ... for all ... private  institutions&quot; raises
important questions for private associations, including churches,
which are  generally accorded far more freedom of action than
governmental and quasigovernmental  institutions that operate
with public funds.  This subparagraph should be amended to include
 language respecting the privacy rights of voluntary and religious
institutions except insofar as  necessary to meet generally accepted
standards of accountability under the laws of each nation.   Without
such language, private institutions are vulnerable to treatment
as publicly owned entities.  Therefore, add &quot;Nothing in this
subparagraph shall be construed to diminish the right of  voluntary
and religious institutions to appropriate privacy protections
consistent with generally accepted standards of accountability
under the law.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph c:  Throughout the document,
no attempt is made to define  &quot;discrimination&quot; or to
limit in any way its application to only those characteristics
of persons  rightly regarded as &quot;neutral&quot;   ethnicity,
national origin, creed, gender, disability, etc.  It may be  better
to leave this term undefined, on the presumption that prevailing
national policies, which  generally protect only neutral characteristics,
are what is meant.  Nonetheless, the recent action in the European
Parliament to protect homosexual partnerships, and US initiatives
to expand &quot;domestic partnership&quot; legislation offer some
argument for defining &quot;discrimination&quot; here to mean
only the protection of neutral characteristics.  Possible language:
 &quot;Eliminating de jure  discrimination, while [ developing]
encouraging educational programmes and media campaigns  aimed
at eliminating de facto discrimination against persons based on
race, sex, national  origin, religion, political affiliation,
disability, or other characteristics unrelated to character or
performance.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph d:  [reflect better]  better
reflects    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph f:  &quot;Making political
and social processes inclusive of all  lawabiding members of society
...&quot;  Many nationstates exclude criminals from access to
certain political and social processes.  The phrase as written,
like much of the declaration, is  susceptible of widely varying
interpretation, but as written it appears open to abuse.  The
best course of action may be to delete the phrase &quot;inclusive
of all members of society and&quot;, since &quot;respecting political
pluralism and cultural diversity&quot; sufficiently describes
an open political  system.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 15, subparagraph c:  &quot;ensuring that all
obstacles to full equity and equality  between women and men are
removed in all private and public institutions of society.&quot;
 The  dangers in this language are obvious.  The United Nations
is hereby committing itself to eliminating anything it regards
as inequities between men and women in private institutions. 
If  churches and parachurch organizations are excepted from this
proscription, that fact is not  mentioned.  These issues have
created tremendous friction and debate in the United States and
 elsewhere in the developed world.  Most US &quot;equal rights&quot;
statutes have been limited in their  application to &quot;public
accommodations,&quot; a term which embraces many private institutions
that  hold themselves forward as open to the public, but excludes
those, such as churches and other  religiously affiliated institutions,
which impose membership requirements based on creed.  Most US
statutes, with one or two exceptions, also exempt private, nonpublicly
supported clubs and  associations (e.g., the Boy Scouts, the YMCA).
 This principle should be protected here.  &quot;Public accommodations&quot;
is not a term common to UN documents.  I recommend revision to
read &quot;all  [private and] public and publicly accessible institutions
of society&quot;.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph a:  The language as written
suggests governmental  interference with the media to ensure socially
constructive attitudes.  The goal is laudable, but its implementation
by government is violative of free speech standards and guarantees.
 The purposes  of government in this regard are better served
by policies that encourage the development of a diverse body of
mass media.  Increasing the body of media voices, not stifling
an errant few, is a proper sphere for government action.  It is
akin to averting the growth of monopolies in the economic sphere.
 If language stating this objective cannot be obtained, change
&quot;Ensuring&quot; to  &quot;Encouraging&quot; to leave this
objective in the realm of the bully pulpit.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph c:  &quot;including on gender,
family and cultural issues ...&quot;  The paragraph as written
is narrow and excludes needed improvements in data collection
on  issues of family structure and culture.  For example, international
data preliminarily examined by scholars at the American Enterprise
Institute suggests a close linkage between infant mortality and
 family structure.  Gender analysis is one of only many relevant
possible areas for improvement.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 17, subparagraph d:  &quot;... policies to
combat terrorism, organized crime,  sexual exploitation and drug
trafficking.&quot;  This additional language gives higher visibility
and  priority to efforts to combat the exploitation of minors
in South Asia and elsewhere around the  world where the international
sex and pornography trade are officially ignored or inadequately
 resisted.    
<P>
Page 22, paragraph 20:  The personal dimension of poverty is excluded
from this analysis of the  origins of poverty.  It is most easily
addressed by modifying the first sentence of the paragraph to
read &quot;and cultural and personal values.&quot;  Without more,
however, this entire section focuses too  heavily on &quot;political
and economic structures&quot; and too lightly on personality structures
such as  selfdiscipline, deferral of gratification, honesty and
hard work.  To address this problem, add  after &quot;those who
cannot support themselves&quot; the following: &quot;to foster
personal qualities of selfdiscipline, honesty, hard work, and
the deferral of gratification;&quot;    
<P>
Page 24, paragraph 26, subparagraph a:  The most important indicator
of poverty is family  structure.  This indicator must be added
to the litany of poverty and vulnerability indicators.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 29, subparagraph a:  Language should be added
to the phrase &quot;redistributing  land&quot; to bar expropriation
and confiscation of lawfully owned and managed property.  The
US  Constitution includes a &quot;takings clause,&quot; which
obliges government to compensate owners for  lawfully expropriated
or attached property.  Even in developed countries, this principle
is  irregularly and inadequately followed.  This paragraph should
read:  &quot;encouraging the  redistribution of [redistributing]
land where necessary to foster a return to productive use  and
where full compensation and other due process of law is guaranteed
to lawful owners.&quot;    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph a:  &quot;access of people
living in poverty to responsible levels  of credit ...&quot; 
The United Nations should not require any lending institution
to make irresponsible  loans.  In fact, the declaration's clear
and repeated call for debt restructuring and forgiveness for 
developing nations dramatizes the fact that irresponsible lending
that ignores economic viability damages both the lending institution
and the dependent party.  This experience must be applied to micro
as well as macroeconomics.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph c:  &quot;Providing incentives
for [, earmarking percentages of  the lending base].  In line
with the criticism noted above, lending institutions must retain,
for the sake of their depositors as well as the wellbeing of borrowers,
reasonable standards of viability and repayability for all loans
in their portfolio.  Encouraging lenders to provide responsible
levels  of credit to impoverished persons for socially valuable
purposes is a laudable aim, but setasides  and quotas can only
encourage distortions in the loan market and the placement of
irresponsible  loans.  This will not alleviate poverty and may,
in fact, hinder normal patterns of development.    
<P>
Page 27, paragraph 32, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
and equal access&quot; to health services  suggests that the same
standards of service that apply to women should apply to girls.
 The  implication is that services to be provided are identical
irrespective of maturity, marital status, or other factors.  Add
at the end of this sentence, &quot;with due regard for the responsibility
of  government to protect the vulnerability of the immature and
the sanctuary of the family.&quot;    
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 33, add a new subparagraph i, and adjust the
following subparagraph accordangle:  &quot;Encouraging the formation
and retention of stable family units, as a shield against poverty,
the appropriate locus for sexual expression, childbearing and
childrearing, and the essential factor in successful education
and the creation of productive and responsible  citizens.&quot;
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 34, subparagraph c:  The antagonism, in some
nations, between formal and  nonformal education for preschoolers
should be acknowledged.  To some extent, these objectives can
be mutually exclusive.  Numerous education experts believe that
nonformal education  within the family is significantly healthier
and more effective than early formal education before a child
is emotionally or psychologically ready to learn.  The best way
to address this concern is to add the word voluntary before &quot;preschool
education&quot; to assure that mandates do not drive out parental
education of young children in the home. 
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph d:  Same changes as recommended
for Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph e:  Removing objectionable
language in this context may  prove impossible.  I recommend instead
that language be added to encourage the provision of  health care
to expectant mothers and the children they carry that will enable
them to carry those  children successfully to term.  &quot;Safe
motherhood&quot; must be made to be synonymous with safety for
 both mother and child  this is logical because, without the child,
it is not motherhood at all. The strategy of proabortion organizations
at Cairo was to move away from an individual conception  of maternal
health that focuses on the health of every motherandchild in utero
toward a collective, public healthoriented concept that denies
the need to protect the health of mother and child in all circumstances.
 This is one occasion where the faulty language in the declaration
can be improved by making it truly universal, i.e., protective
of all mothers and children.  Amend this language to read &quot;full
access to such services, including voluntary and informed reproductive
health/family planning care for married couples [and], education
on safe motherhood, and  supportive services for all expectant
mothers and the children they carry, [and prenatal and postnatal
care] both prenatally and postnatally.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 35, subparagraph e.  &quot;Expanding and strengthening
social insurance   programmes and tax policies to protect working
people ...&quot;  Burdensome taxation can subject  working families
to poverty.  Recently the United States reformed a program called
the Earned  Income Tax Credit to provide additional income to
lift working families above the poverty line.   Broadly considered,
this is a &quot;social insurance&quot; programme, but the key
is that it is based on an  alleviation of taxation on the working
family, not the direct imposition of a tax on families or  other
entities.   
<P>
Page 30, paragraph 36, subparagraph d:  &quot;Improving the status
of the single parent in society&quot; is  opposed to policies
that responsibly discourage the deliberate choice of single parenthood
or  sexual irresponsibility.  Assisting single parents to care
for their child is generally sound policy,  but even here society
gains nothing by refusing to recognize that promotion of adoption
is the  better alternative for many single mothers.  To avoid
these notional difficulties, amend this  subparagraph to read:
[&quot;Improving the status of the single parent in society and]
Ensuring that  singleparent families receive the social support
they need, include support for adequate housing and the child
care of their choice, with special emphasis on incentives for
marriage and  strengthening extended family networks.&quot;  
<P>
Page 32, paragraph 43, bullet one:  The &quot;full participation
of employers and trade unions&quot;  excludes the vast majority
of the world's workers.  Add &quot;nonunionized workers&quot;
to this phrase.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 46, add a subparagraph g:  &quot;Establishing
policies to encourage invention and entrepreneurship, to protect
the products of invention and entrepreneurship from  misappropriation,
and to provide inventors and entrepreneurs with access to capital
and  economic rewards sufficient to encourage the development
and introduction of new technologies and methods.&quot;  Much
technological development takes place outside &quot;national and
local technology institutions; indeed, the home computer revolution
was largely sparked by the  technical wizardry of two Americans
working out of a garage.  Assurance of economic rewards,  protection
of copyrights and patents, and access to capital are as or more
critical than support for technology institutions as a means to
promote employmentintensive growth.  Experience demonstrates that
governments cannot always predict, produce, or judge which technologies
will have the most profound impact in promoting economic growth
and human betterment.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 47, subparagraph d:  Revise to read &quot;increasing
family benefits and social  support such as equitable and substantial
financial support for all forms of child care, including care
at home.       
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph d.  This paragraph is a glaring
demonstration of the  irreconcilability of the declaration's claimed
dedication to sovereignty and its clear commitment to utilize
United Nations instrumentalities to change attitudes toward the
division of paid labor and housework!  Many families around the
world obviously do not wish their attitudes to be changed.  They
believe explicitly in the social and childrearing advantages of
a single wageearner  structure.  They have no wish to impose those
structure on all peoples and families around the globe.  They
adopt such patterns as sequencing in which a primary caregiver,
usually the mother, leaves the paid labor force to devote herself
fulltime to the care of her family, only to return to paid labor
as the children enter formal schooling or are fully grown.  That
the United Nations would seek to use its resources to foster the
destruction of such patterns is reprehensible, but it will also
ultimately be futile.  This language is a retreaded version of
the most doctrinaire  feminism that is losing popularity even
in the most advanced nations.  If language of any kind is  needed,
it should state only &quot;Devising public policies that support
maximum family choice and empowerment over questions of parental
division of labor.&quot;  The reference to &quot;child care  facilities&quot;
appears to favor the least popular form of child care in the United
States, i.e.,  institutional child care.  This phrase should be
modified to read, as above, support for all forms  of child care,
including home care and family care.  The phrase profamily tax
relief should  also be added to this litany of workfamily policies,
as this issue transcends all the others in  promoting family freedom.
 Other objections could be raised to this paragraph, but these
are the  major ones.    
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph e.  On the scale of public
values, encouraging fathers and  mothers to stay together is far
more important than using atomic scales to measure gender  equality
in diaperchanging and other domestic duties.  Nearly all studies
of child care issues point out that most parents would prefer
to have one or both working parents spend more time with their
children, if loss of income were not an issue.  The point is that
all of these subparagraphs ignore parental choice and parental
preferences and subordinate them to the goal of encouraging women
to take paid employment.  Other than ideology, it is not clear
why this should be so.  This  paragraph should be replaced with
one that reads:  Encouraging governments to recognize the unique
contributions of families with children and to adopt policies
that maximize parental time spent in childrearing activities and
minimize the need for families to spend inordinate time in paid
labor activities at the expense of overall family wellbeing. 
The goal here is to encourage at least some form of a family wage
system that leaves each parent's role as the parents mutually
agree.  Parttime, flexible, and home working schedules promote
this result, as well.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 64, add to the last bullet item listed:  &quot;violence,
crime, drug abuse and  trafficking, sexual exploitation, and other
behaviors that diminish productivity, shorten lifespan and spread
disease.  This language is needed to assure that &quot;respect
for diversity&quot; does not  include respect for actions that
involve a dimension of personal immorality.  &quot;Diversity&quot;
properly means neutral differences, not moral disputes about issues
of character.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 66, subparagraph c:  Revise to read &quot;Giving
community organizations,  private associations and natural institutions
like the family greater control . . .&quot;                  
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph a:  The phrase &quot;as appropriate&quot;
may suffice to address  concern about the overextension of prohibitions
on discrimination to distinctly moral categories. Marriage laws
currently &quot;discriminate&quot; against samegender pairs. 
Enacting legislation to  reverse this situation would be inappropriate,
but it may be wiser to nail this down with some  effort to define
unacceptable discrimination.  Note the language at page 40, paragraph
59 that  comes close to defining the scope of acceptable prohibitions
on discrimination:  &quot;different groups which are defined by
language, ethnicity, religion, geography or class.&quot;  This
internal definition  may offer a route to an acceptably limited
definition of discrimination, with the addition of gender and
disability.    
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph b:  [removal of reservations],
for the reasons noted above.    
<P>
Page 45, paragraph 71, subparagraph a:  In many places in the
declaration, the emphasis on the  elimination of violence against
certain groups in society (armed conflict, for example) is culturally
true and entirely appropriate.  Here it is mystifying.  Young
males are disproportionately the victims of homicide (at the hands
of other young males, in most cases) in developed countries, including
the United States.  On the general issue of social violence, thereis
absolutely no need for gender oneupmanship.  The United Nations
should never jettison concern for violence against young men,
who are among the most pathetic victims of family breakup in advanced
societies.  I recommend ending the first sentence of this paragraph
as follows, &quot;with particular attention to vulnerable persons
who are the most frequent victims of violent acts.&quot;  Crime
and violence are pervasive enough that they should never be turned
into mere group politics.    
<P>
Page 47.  Nearly every word on this page illustrates the tension
in this document between its  repeated pledges to respect and
promote &quot;decentralization,&quot; government &quot;closest
to the people,&quot;  &quot;national sovereignty,&quot; &quot;small
business entrepreneurs&quot; and &quot;grassroots/community organizations.&quot;
   As national strategies are here designed, &quot;priorities
and time frames&quot; are the responsibility of national governments.
 &quot;Massive political will to invest in people&quot; is required
to achieve these goals.  All of this is &quot;primarily the responsibility
of national Governments.&quot;  The declaration does not strive
to reconcile these contradictory themes and objectives.  In small
nationstates, national Governments may in fact be close to the
people.  In large nations, they are remote, and the general direction
of policy reform is running counter to central government solutions.
 The declaration's only attempt to resolve this problem is to
include language at various points that expresses all points of
view.  The irony of the United nations amassing resources and
summoning political will to promote local solutions ought not
to miss anyone's attention.  There are far too many problems with
this page to fix it, but it is probably the clearest expression
yet of the authors' actual intent in devising the programme of
action.    
<P>
Page 48, paragraph 75, prologue:  Include family counseling and
assistance among the spheres  of work done by NGOs.          
<P>
Page 49, paragraph 76, subparagraph f:  This paragraph includes
the first reference in the  document to &quot;debate&quot; about
the direction of social policy.  The rest of the declaration could
be  improved by correcting this omission and recognizing that
the most progressive nations are those that have the most debate
about all of the issues covered by the document.    
<P>
Page 50, paragraph 77, subparagraph a:  add nonpunitive before
&quot;taxes&quot;; add at the end or that  provide incentives
for selfdefeating and selfdestructive behaviors.    
<P>
Page 52, paragraph 82.  This paragraph broaches the possibility
of vesting the United Nations  with taxing authority.  This idea
is only surfaced here, but its philosophical implications are
 profound.  It raises the possibility that the United Nations
Economic and Social Council will take on the characteristics of
an extralateral, rather than multilateral institution.  Such a
mechanism  would inevitably diminish individual nations' role
in managing and overseeing the development of  United Nations
policy.  This paragraph deserves wide publicity and debate now.
 Similar concerns are raised by the references to international
taxation and involuntary financing of the United  Nations at paragraphs
85 b and 86 g.

<p>
The Clinton Administration's women-in-combat policy has created
an atmosphere which may make it difficult for officers to comply
with combat-related military service.  The recent case of Navy
helicopter pilot Lieutenant Commander Ken Carkhuff illustrates
the unfortunate turn that the pursuit of a gender-blind military
may be taking for the US Navy and for those who object to the
policy. 
<P>
On August 24, 1994, Carkhuff told his executive officer, &quot;I
cannot take this detachment to sea.&quot;  The detachment included
two female pilots, and Carkhuff later explained, &quot;I could
not appear to endorse a policy [the women-in-combat policy] that
I didn't agree with.&quot; Carkhuff's statement disqualified him
from leading his detachment. His commander relieved him of his
duties and two officer boards have concluded that Carkhuff should
be honorably discharged from the service.[1]
<P>
Carkhuff told the &quot;show cause&quot; board on May 18, 1995,
&quot;I think that we should not be subjecting... women to violence,
and there is no more extreme violence that a human can be involved
in than in combat.&quot;[2]  He said that he was not anxious to confront
the policy and stated that he had no objection to women serving
in the Navy.[3]
<P>
Carkhuff had, in fact, just completed a year at the Naval War
College where the issue of women in combat was debated extensively.
 He had strong and religiously-based views on this issue.  The
day he privately stated his view to his boss corresponded to the
birth of his fifth child, a daughter.  Carkhuff feared that leading
women into a possible combat situation [the US invasion of Haiti
was weeks away] would incrementally lead to expanded combat roles
for women and perhaps his own daughter's forced combat role in
the future.
<P>
Commander Carkhuff did state at the hearing that &quot;if ordered
to execute that policy, I will do it.&quot;[4]  Nevertheless, the
Navy stood by its decision to discharge him honorably.
<P>
This case raises questions about a double standard at work in
the Navy on the issue of voicing personal opinions about women
in combat.  In 1992, uniformed female Navy officers gathered on
Capitol Hill to lobby against the female combat 
ban, labeling it an &quot;equal opportunity issue.&quot;  The
Navy ignored regulations which restrict uniformed sailors from
personal lobbying and did not discipline these officers.  However,
Carkhuff's private protest resulted in an honorable discharge.
 This would demonstrate that violations committed while protesting
in support of women in combat are ignored, while those protests
against the policy of women in combat are punished.
<P>
More importantly, this case raises questions about whether the
Navy is in danger of losing good men due to its women-in-combat
policy.  Carkhuff was a proven officer with consistently high
performance ratings.  Assuming there are other exemplary men who,
because of such policies, will cut short their military careers,
the military does not profit.  Nor does it profit from the fact
that this policy may discourage some would-be &quot;top guns&quot;
from responding to recruitment appeals to pursue a military career.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has erased more than 250,000 combat
exemptions for women.  Today, women can be assigned to 95 percent
of all Navy billets.  Feminists say this is progress, but combat
veterans and our combat-hardened allies know this portends disaster.
 In fact, the Navy's policy of women in combat is contrary to
the findings of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment
of Women in the Armed Forces.
<P>
The board reviewing Carkhuff did not find that Carkhuff lacked
the ability to perform.  According to Navy documents, he is being
honorably separated for disagreeing with a politically sensitive
policy, and for refusing to perform a duty.
<P>
When officers so strongly protest, it is time for the Pentagon
and Congress to reconsider the wisdom of policies that increase
the combat role of women.  Men like Carkhuff deserve the opportunity
to honorably serve, rather than have their careers cut short by
an unfortunate and dangerous policy.

<title>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN FROM VIOLENCE</title>

<h2>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN<br>
FROM VIOLENCE</h2>

<p>
Studies and pronouncements about violence against women continue
to make headlines.  Recently, the Justice Department announced
that a redesigned national survey found that violence against
women is much higher than previously reported.  The survey also
reveals that marriage often shields women from violence.  
<P>
Any violence against women should be strongly condemned, and offenders
should be punished to the full extent of the law.   But some feminists
exaggerate the real scope of this tragic problem using unvetted
advocacy research.   Consider some advocacy reporting:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;There are three to four million women beaten by husbands
or lovers every year; that's one every 15 seconds.&quot;  (<I>Chicago
Tribune</I>, February 10, 1992)
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Four million to six million women are beaten [each year].
 That means once every five seconds...a woman is punched or kicked...or
held down and pummeled.&quot;  (Associated Press)[1]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Miami talk-show host Pat Stevens told a <I>Crossfire</I> audience
that 60 million women are abused every year.[2]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Ms</I>. magazine's &quot;Campus Project on Sexual Assault&quot;
claims that 15.4 percent of college women are raped and 12.1 percent
experience an attempted rape each year.[3]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When President Clinton named Bonnie Campbell to head the &quot;Violence
Against Women&quot; office at the Justice Department, he said
there are 700,000 rapes or attempted rapes every year.[4]
</UL>
<P>
<P>
The bases for these &quot;facts&quot; are seldom given and they
should be suspect.  After all, there are 31,536,000 seconds in
a year.  If an American woman is victimized every 15 seconds,
then there are in reality 2,124,000 incidents.  Five million violent
female victimizations would be one every 6.3 seconds.
<P>
The August, 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistics study, &quot;Violence
Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey,&quot; provides
a different, although, sobering picture.[5]
Men are far more likely to be victims of crime (64.9 v. 43.7 per
1,000 persons) than women.[6]   But women are nine times more likely
than men to become rape/sexual assault victims.[7]   That figure
is higher than previously reported.
<P>
The new survey estimates there are 500,200 female victimizations
each year which includes 172,400 completed rapes and 141,200 attempted
rapes.[8]  In comparison, the FBI previously reported 109,062 forcible
rapes for 1992, which was a 38.2 percent rise in the total number
of reported rapes and a 27 percent rate increase since 1973.[9]
<P>
The study is based on the redesigned National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS) which is a continuous nationally representative
sample of 50,000 households.  The latest report includes the years
1992-1993 and with revised questions it found that the average
annual rate of violent victimization per 1,000 women rose from
5.4 in 1987-91 to 9.4.[10]
<P>
The woman's relationship to the offender is a key variable.  The
1995 study found that a woman is three times more likely to be
raped or sexually assaulted by a boyfriend and 10 times more likely
to be raped or sexually assaulted by an acquaintance thanby a
spouse.  Single women are just as likely to be raped or sexually
assaulted by a stranger as they are by a boyfriend.[11]
<P>
When all acts of violence against women are considered, married
or widowed women are 30 times less likely than separated women
to become violence victims.  Married women are at least four times
less likely than never-married women to be crime victims.[12]
<P>
The study also found that women aged 19-29 are the most likely
violence victims.  They are twice as likely to become victims
as 30 to 45 year old women and 12 to 18 year old girls.[13]  Although
the Justice Department report does not explain the difference,
U.S. Census Bureau statistics show that the older female cohort
tends to be married and the younger cohort is more likely to live
in homes where there is a protecting father.[14]
<P>
Family income also makes a big difference.  Women from middle
income families tend to be four times safer than those from families
with incomes under $10,000.  Education, ethnicity and race are
not major violence discriminators.[15]
<P>
<center><h3>CONCLUSIONS ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</h3></center>
<P>
Incidents of rape and sexual assault are officially higher than
previously reported but do not come close to the figures offered
by some advocacy researchers.  Based on the new survey it's too
early to determine whether violence against women is rising. 
But it's clear that the offender/victim relationship is key and
deserves more attention.
<P>
Young women (19-29 years old), who have never married (or are
separated) and have low incomes are most vulnerable to violence.
 Their offenders are more likely to be known to them, and crime
by non-strangers usually occurs at or near the woman's home. 
<P>
The survey shows that marriage protects all female cohorts from
every type of violence.  Married women are safer than single,
separated, divorced and never-married women.    
<P>
Marriage also reduces violent crime incidents among men.  It helps
to channel male aggression toward positive goals.  Never-married
men are more likely to commit assault and they suffer most (58.9
percent) assaults.[16]  They are also five times more likely to rape
and commit other violent crime than married men.[17]
<P>
The Justice Department's latest report should encourage government
to harness marriage as a shield against violence.  The report
also tells American women and girls that the safest place today
is living in homes with their husbands and fathers.

<h2>THE STRAIGHT STORY<br>
ON NEW JERSEY:<br>
BIRTHS, ABORTIONS, AND THE FAMILY CAP</h2>

<p>
In August of 1993, the first &quot;family cap&quot; in the nation
took effect in the state of New Jersey as part of a larger package
of reforms known as the Family Development Program.  The family
cap provision stipulates that a mother who has already received
welfare benefits for at least 10 months and who bears an additional
child will receive no increase in her basic monthly AFDC benefit.
 The provision affects only the monthly <I>cash</I> benefit, however.
 Health benefits and food stamps continue to increase with family
size.
<P>
The raw numbers of births and abortions in New Jersey since the
cap took effect strongly suggest that the policy has reduced the
number of births to AFDC mothers without affecting the abortion
rate.
<P>
Raw data for the 20-month period from August 1992 to March 1994
appears in Table 1:

<P>
The total number of abortions in the year before the policy took
effect was 11,817, yielding a monthly average of 984.75.  In the
eight months after the policy took effect (including March 1994,
which had a far higher total of abortions than any other month
on record), the total number of abortions was 7,932, yielding
a monthly average of 991.5.  The difference (0.7%) is trivial
and well within the expected range of random fluctuation.  If
the anomalous month of March were excluded from the analysis,
the average would be just 953 abortions per month after the introduction
of the family cap -- a 3% decline from the previous year's average,
but also trivial enough to be within the range of random fluctuation.
<P>
A more comprehensive look at the data reduces the significance
of the difference even further.  The average monthly caseload
in the year before the family cap was enacted was 121,479.  In
the eight months post-cap, the average monthly caseload was 122,679
-- a difference of less than 1%.  But the monthly abortion rate
(number of abortions per 1,000 AFDC cases) was 8.11 in the year
prior to enactment of the family cap and only 8.08 in the eight
months post-enactment.  The difference is too small to be statistically
significant, but it is worth noting that the total number of abortions
in the period after implementation of the cap was three <I>fewer</I>
than predicted by the rate before enactment of the policy.
<P>
Using the entire preceding year as the baseline, however, tends
to distort the real effect of the family cap because the abortion
rate was very low in the period ranging from August to November
1992.  During the eight months immediately preceding the introduction
of the cap (December 1992 to July 1993), New Jersey welfare mothers
underwent 8,144 abortions -- 212 <I>more</I> than in the eight
months after the cap took effect.  If the post-cap data did not
include the month of March 1994, moreover, the post-cap abortion
average would have been 8% less than the average for the previous
seven months.
<P>
No responsible statistician would therefore conclude that the
family cap must reduce abortions.  But an honest evaluation of
the available data strongly argues that, contrary to the fears
expressed by many in the pro-life community, the family cap has
had no impact on the number or rate of abortions among New Jersey's
AFDC recipients.  The monthly abortion totals fluctuated with
no apparent pattern, but were always within the expected range.
 The total number of abortions in the eight months post-cap was
almost exactly what would have been projected if there had been
no change in the state's welfare policy.
<P>
The birth rate among AFDC recipients, on the other hand, was significantly
lower after introduction of the family cap.  In the year prior
to the cap, the total number of births to welfare mothers in New
Jersey was 15,972, yielding a monthly average of 1,331 births
and a monthly rate of 10.96 births per thousand AFDC recipients.
 In the eight months post-cap, there were 9,519 births, yielding
a monthly average of 1,190 births and a monthly rate of 9.70 births
per thousand AFDC recipients.  The difference is consistent, substantial,
and statistically significant.
<P>
In all eight months after the introduction of the cap, the birth
totals were below the previous year's average and lower than the
total for the corresponding month in the previous year.  The monthly
abortion totals after implementation of the cap show a more random
pattern.  In six of the eight months, there were fewer abortions
than the previous year's average, but in only three of those months
was the abortion total lower than the total for the corresponding
month the year before.
<P>
When the entire 20-month period is divided into 4-month increments
(see Table 2), the change in the average number of births is obvious.
 The family cap has produced a significant reduction in the number
of births and pregnancies, but has had no discernible impact on
the number of abortions.

<P>
<P>
The only way to calculate a higher abortion rate for the post-cap
period is to suppress the data from April to July 1993 -- the
period immediately prior to implementation of the new policy --
and compare the abortion totals from the post-cap period with
the totals from the corresponding months of the previous year.
 <I>Unless the April to July 1993 data is suppressed, </I>the
abortion rate after implementation of the family cap appears to
be either the same as or lower than the abortion rate before the
cap.
<P>
There are only two hypotheses that could justify suppressing the
April to July 1993 data and preserve the finding that the abortion
rate has increased since implementation of the cap.
<P>
First, it is possible that the abortion rate follows an annual
cyclical pattern and that the monthly abortion totals from April
to July 1994 will show the same inflation as in 1993.  But a close
examination of the month-by-month totals suggests that the high
months and low months in the two years do not correspond with
enough consistency to indicate a seasonal cycle.  In 1992-1993,
the months with high abortion totals were October, January, and
March, while August, November, and December registered low totals.
 In 1993-1994, August and March were the months with a high number
of abortions, and the September total was relatively low.
<P>
The second hypothesis is that welfare mothers may have staged
an &quot;abortion rush&quot; prior to implementation of the family
cap, thereby generating unusually high abortion totals in the
months immediately preceding the change in policy.  But the single
month in which an &quot;abortion rush&quot; would have been most
visible, July 1993, had a lower abortion total than either June
1993 or August 1993.  The number of abortions declined between
June and July and increased between July and August.  The time
period with the highest number of abortions spanned six months,
from March to August -- straddling the enactment date -- and then
was followed by six months of low abortion totals after implementation
of the family cap.
<P>
While it is still premature to draw any decisive conclusions from
the welfare reform experiment in New Jersey, it is becoming increasingly
fantastic to claim that the state has experienced an upsurge in
abortions since the family cap took effect.  The reported &quot;increase&quot;
in abortions rests on a statistical illusion created by suppressing
data from the four-month period immediately preceding the policy
change -- which includes the highest abortion totals recorded
in the data under study.
<P>
Those who would hold welfare reform hostage in the name of saving
lives bear a significant burden of proof in maintaining that more
lives will be saved by preserving the current welfare system.
 The consistent, strong correlation between increased welfare
spending and increased abortions should be far more troublesome
data to pro-lifers than the most recent numbers from New Jersey.

<title>RENEWING THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR EDUCATION</title>

<h2>RENEWING THE AMERICAN DREAM<br>
FOR EDUCATION</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Jennifer A. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
High-profile advocates of public education lack an inspiring vision
for the educational renewal of America.  President Bill Clinton,
Secretary of Education Richard Riley, Congress, teacher union
bosses -- all alternately cheerlead and criticize, but their discussions
usually degenerate into bickering over funding, equity, and the
competitiveness of the American economy.  Ultimately, they are
concerned about the educational <I>system</I> and its place in
the larger context of American society and the national economy.
Little of what they have to say deals with the real stuff of
education.
<p>
Dorothy Sayers, an author and a contemporary of C.S. Lewis, articulated
half a century ago the foolishness of focusing on the system and
thereby missing the whole aim of education:
<p><blockquote>
What use is it to pile task on task and prolong the days of labor,
if at the close the chief object is left unattained?  It is not
the fault of the teachers -- they work only too hard already.
 The combined folly of a civilization that has forgotten its own
roots is forcing them to shore up the tottering weight of an educational
structure that is built upon sand....  For the sole true end of
education is simply this:  to teach men how to learn for themselves;
and whatever instruction fails to do this is effort spent in vain.[1]
</blockquote><p>
Sayers clearly had a vision of what education ought to be.
<p>
Today, once again, those with the academic zeal that rallies others
to renew education have a vision that goes beyond the realities
of the public school system.  Their common sense, optimistic ideas
are not constrained by the inadequacies of a federally run education
bureaucracy.  As Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville remarked in 1835,
such freedom from bureaucracy is -- or at least once was -- distinctively
American:  &quot;Uniformity or permanence of design, the minute
arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative system
must not be sought for in the United States; what we find there
is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild, is at
least robust....&quot;[2] Homeschooling and classical education
exemplify this genius and vibrancy of the American people.
<p>
<center><h3>SCHOOLING BY THE TRUE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
We have long known that the &quot;true department of education,&quot;
as author Douglas Wilson refers to the family, is the institution
behind the success of the homeschool movement.[3] Recent scholarship,
however, shows the role of the family in the academic success
of children in all settings. Because parents are vested with the
authority and responsibility to oversee their children's upbringing,
especially their education, homeschooling ought not to be considered
the method of last resort, but a first option.  Recent scholarship
demonstrates that, no matter what the school setting, family is
the key factor in the academic success of children.[4]
<p>
Critics may view homeschoolers as somewhat reclusive, but the
flourishing movement contributes to society much more than they
recognize.  Increased interaction within the family counters the
individualism and the &quot;generation gaps&quot; created by the
secular culture.  With some 400,000 families currently homeschooling,
the movement has also become a gathering point for inter-family
relations.  Networks and support groups abound (see the addendum
for a sample listing).  Though the homeschooling movement takes
a back-to-basics approach to academics, it is thoroughly progressive
when it comes to using the latest technology.  CompuServe and
America Online forums provide helpful hints on raising kids, curriculum
tips, homework help, and an ongoing discussion of a new ideal
for education.
<p>
Homeschoolers are some of the most politically involved private
citizens in America.  Politicians have learned not to trifle with
the &quot;stay-at-home mom&quot; with a phone tree, a fax machine,
and a firm devotion to raising well-grounded children.  Initially
a measure for self-defense, homeschoolers' lobbying efforts have
strengthened the platform for all families in America.   Nationwide
homeschool networks have proven to be very effective avenues of
communication.  The Home School Legal Defense Association, located
outside of Washington, D.C., disseminates regular alerts calling
homeschoolers to action when threats to their -- and everyone's
-- freedom arise.
<p>
Bill and Mary Pride and their nine children are the epitome of
a fully engaged homeschooling family.  Ranging from toddlers to
teens, the kids are all taught at home and always have been. 
The Pride children's educational package takes advantage of everything
from traditional material to on-line computer classes.  To share
their good news in education, the Prides publish a quarterly magazine
called <i>Practical Homeschooling</i> with 96 pages of suggestions
for networking, critiques of curriculum and software, discussions
of educational theories and lighthearted openness about the joys
and trials of the homeschooling life.  Mary does much of the writing
herself and also gathers articles from some of the most staunchly
conservative education thinkers in the nation, including Samuel
Blumenfeld and Doug Wilson.  <I>Practical Homeschooling</I> now
has an on-line site of its own which includes forums for Q &amp;
A on homeschooling pragmatics and on-line chats with contributing
authors.
<p>
<center><h3>THE RETURN OF CLASSICAL EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
Truly a timeless educational philosophy, classical education has
now hit cyberspace and become the subject of much chatting in
homeschool online forums.  The resurgence of this medieval model
of education is due in large part to Douglas Wilson, author of
<I>Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning.</I>  His title refers
to the essay which inspired his efforts, entitled, &quot;The Lost
Tools of Learning,&quot; by Dorothy Sayers.  Miss Sayers' 1947
critique of education stall efforts in an apt commentary on America's
system of public education in the '90s:
<p><blockquote>
We dole out lip-service to the importance of education -- lip-service
and, just occasionally, a little grant of money; we postpone the
school-leaving age, and plan to build bigger and better schools;
the teachers slave conscientiously in and out of school hours;
and yet, as I believe, all this devoted effort is largely frustrated,
because we have lost the tools of learning, and in their absence
can only make a botched and piecemeal job of it.[5]
</blockquote><p>
What she goes on to describe as &quot;the lost tools of learning&quot;
are the disciplines of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric.  These are
the tools with which students must be equipped, she argues, in
order to tackle the content of any subject.  Sayers considers
Latin an important learning tool as well.  As the key to so many
languages, to the vocabulary of science, and to historical documents,
she estimates that in most subject areas, a knowledge of Latin
would cut learning time by half.  The study of Latin, and not
the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the test, may prove to be the
surest way to recoup lost ground on the verbal section of the
SAT.
<p>
The contemporary relevance of Miss Sayers' insights is astonishing.
 While federal bureaucrats set a National Education Goal that
all our children will start school ready to learn, Sayers points
out that children are by nature sponges ready to absorb information.
 For those who disparage memorization and the accumulation of
factual knowledge, she points out that young children love litanies
of information.  She gives a whole new meaning to age appropriateness,
a topic of great discussion in the teaching colleges, by tying
Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric to a child's stages of mental development.
 And how about Latin, as Sayers suggests, for early childhood
education?  &quot;The Lost Tools of Learning&quot; ought to be
required reading in every teacher education class; it cuts through
the confusion and inconsistencies of modern educational theory.
 Sayers' vision is idealistic yet practical; it has the power
to inspire and the wisdom to work.
<p>
Doug Wilson has demonstrated that effectiveness.  Fourteen years
ago he founded Logos School, a distinctively Christian school
based on the Sayers' model of classical education.  Today there
are some thirty member schools in his Association of Classical
and Christian Schools (ACCS).   &quot;These schools are engaged
in what might be one of the most important educational reforms
of our time,&quot; writes Dr. Gene Veith, Dean of Arts and Sciences
at Concordia University.[6] Dr. Veith is in the midst of a year-long
study of classical education.  While modern education disintegrates,
notes Dr. Veith, these classical schools are &quot;recovering
the very approach to education that gave birth to Western civilization
and has continually brought that civilization to renewal.&quot;
 The re-popularization of classical education is timely indeed.
<p>
<center><h3>THE GREAT BOOKS</h3></center>
<p>
While equipping students with grammar, logic, and rhetoric, classical
education focuses on the great literary works of Western civilization,
something modern schools do less and less as contemporary books
replace the old.  The neglect of great books in the schools is
a symptom of a wider cultural trend, as evidenced by the disappearance
of classics from many libraries across the nation.  The Family
Research Council study, &quot;Discarded Images:  Selected Classics
and American Libraries,&quot; by Charles Donovan and William Spont,
documents this phenomenon.
<p>
Large tomes of collected works with ancient bindings may intimidate
the modern reader, but C.S. Lewis argues that old books are not
merely for the expert, but especially for the ordinary reader:
<p><blockquote>
[I]f the average student wants to find out something about Platonism,
the very last thing he thinks of doing is to take a translation
of Plato off the library shelf and read the <I>Symposium</I>.
 He would rather read some dreary modern book ten times as long,
all about 'isms' and influences and only once in twelve pages
telling him what Plato actually said....  But if he only knew,
the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible
than this modern commentator....  It has always therefore been
one of my main endeavours as a teacher to persuade the young that
first-hand knowledge is not only more worth acquiring than second-hand
knowledge, but is usually much easier and more delightful to acquire.[7]
</blockquote><p>
In contrast, Lewis advises the ordinary reader to take up the
old books &quot;precisely because he is an amateur and therefore
much less protected than the expert against the dangers of an
exclusive contemporary diet.  A new book is still on its trial
and the amateur is not in a position to judge it.&quot;[8] Classical
education has taken the precaution of going back to the revered
classics.
<p>
<center><h3>NEW CONCLUSIONS FROM OLD PRINCIPLES</h3></center>
<p>
While homeschool and classical education may be perceived as eccentric,
esoteric, and even impractical because of their intense pursuit
of &quot;intellectualism,&quot; they are actually thoroughly pragmatic.
 Both models guide students through the learning process efficiently
and deliberately.  The educational sequence is logical and meaningful.
 Meanwhile, we continue to fund a modern public school system
that measures hours spent in school (&quot;seat time&quot;), where
the curriculum is so disjointed that classroom teachers are hard
pressed to answer students' question, &quot;Why do we have to
learn this?&quot;  Convoluted attempts to standardize and individualize
simultaneously have resulted in a dysfunctional system.
<p>
The traditional methods espoused by homeschooling and classical
education strike just the balance the public school system lacks.
 They hold a universally high standard of excellence, and an inherent
standardization which comes from keeping educationally on-task.
 Yet the homeschool and classical models are also much more individualized
than the public school classroom, not only on the basis of size,
but also in personal attention to the development of each child's
mind.  While in the modern system the outcome is paramount, in
classical education and homeschooling the process is just as important
as the end.
<p>
Classical education and homeschooling recognize that different
students have varying strengths, and that each student should
be strengthened in all domains.  Where public education has gradually
excluded certain subjects (art, music, logic, etc.) from the core
curriculum and advised teachers to cater to all learning styles
in the remaining subjects, homeschool and classical education
have embraced the classical liberal arts which train students
in the whole spectrum of knowledge.  A student may excel in one
area and struggle in another, but he will grow in all.
<p>
Leaders of public education would do well to take cues from their
competitors.  Commitment to the system, however, continues to
prevent many from recognizing potentials for renewal. Consequently,
significant overhaul of the public school system may be the only
remedy.  As Doug Wilson notes, this is exactly what William Bennett,
former Secretary of Education, suggested after the Governors'
education summit in 1989, which initiated the America 2000/Goals
2000 agenda:
<p><blockquote>
I'd give the education reform movement another five years.  If
we're not able to get our schools back to where they were in 1963,
after spending 40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare
bankruptcy, give the people back their money, and let them start
their own schools.  That would be a radical way to have accountability.[9]
</blockquote><p>
Time's up.   The people have started their own schools and they
have already outdone the public school system.   We want our money
back.

<title>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</title>

<h2>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS:<br>
GOOD FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM,<br>
GOOD FOR FAMILIES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Catherine A. Deeds</i></center>
<p>
<center><h3>CURRENT HEALTH CARE SITUATION</h3></center>
<p>
Last year's historic health care debate proved -- to the surprise
of no one but the Clinton Administration -- that American families
will not tolerate federal bureaucrats or &quot;gatekeepers&quot;
in Washington dictating their medical services and choice of doctors.
  A government-run, &quot;one size <I>must </I>fit all&quot; health
policy violates Americans' fundamental principles of freedom.
<p>
An overwhelming majority (roughly 85 percent) of small businesses
provide health insurance for their employees but they should not
be <I>forced</I> to pay for them through a federal mandate, as
Clinton's plan would have required.  A government mandate costs
wages and jobs in the long run and is not the way to reform health
care or help the uninsured population. 
<p>
While employer-provided health benefits may address the problem
of health care &quot;access,&quot;  they do not address the problem
of rising health care costs, which everyone agrees needs to be
addressed.  The national debate on health care reform debunked
the &quot;Washington knows best&quot; philosophy in favor of innovative
state and free-market health care initiatives.  At the forefront
of free-market reform is the concept of medical savings accounts
(also known as MSAs, Medisave accounts, or Medical IRAs).  They
are the centerpiece of the Republicans' health care plan and have
proved popular with the 2,000 private companies that now have
them.  The basic premise is that MSAs empower consumers to make
their own decisions about spending on routine health care, choose
their own doctors, and save unspent account funds from year to
year to pay for future health or retirement needs.  By contrast,
the present &quot;third-party payer&quot; system offers no incentive
to spend wisely because someone else -- the government or private
insurance --  is paying the bill. 
<p>
This year, a bipartisan Congressional proposal to make MSAs tax
free (like traditional health insurance) has 130 cosponsors and
prospects for passage are good.  Congressional Republicans have
advocated MSAs as a potential cost-saving measure for Medicare
recipients as well.
<p>
<I>This year $1 trillion was spent on health care, accounting
for one-seventh of the nation's entire economy</I>.  As costs
rise, consumers pay higher premiums for their health insurance.
 For the most part, consumers are spending the money of a third
party -- the insurance company or government.  When this is the
case, common sense shows that consumers will not spend frugally
or wisely.  Why should they?   Former Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop likened the present third-party payer system to this:  The
government invites people to pick out a new car, charge it to
a card they issue, and then pays the bill.  The problem with this
system is that no one buys a Hyundai.  They all buy Cadillacs
and BMWs.
<p>
Our present health care system discourages competition and cost-consciousness
because, unlike car insurance, the consumer does not see the bill
or, for the most part, use his own money to pay for services.
 Therefore, there is no incentive to shop for lower-cost medical
care.  The administrative costs of processing insurance claims
for the majority of employers account for up to 35 percent of
total premium costs, and average 25 percent of premium costs for
the majority of employers.
<p>
This is the case because traditional indemnity/health insurance
plans tend to stipulate a low-deductible (out-of-pocket) amount
of $100-$250.  In other words, once the consumer has paid the
first $250 out of pocket for his family's medical care, the insurance
begins to pay.  That seems like a good deal but it is very expensive
in the long run because of high administrative costs and the lack
of cost-consciousness that the third-party payment system instills.
<p>
It would make better economic sense for businesses or individuals
to purchase a &quot;high-deductible&quot; health insurance plan
(which costs less in monthly premiums), combined with an MSA for
health care expenses below the deductible level.  (This type of
arrangement, however, does not enjoy equitable tax treatment under
current law.)  The Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care
estimates that approximately 10 percent of Americans spend <I>more
than</I> $2,000 per year on medical expenses.  A March/April 1994
<I>Journal of American Health Policy</I> study (using 1994 dollars)
of one million Americans showed that one-third of the population
filed no claims in 1989; 73 percent filed $500 or less in claims;
82 percent filed  $1,000 or less; and 89 percent filed $2,000
or less.  &quot;In other words, if this group had a $2,000 deductible
MSA, only 11 percent would have reached the deductible,&quot;
the editors noted.  An MSA empowers consumers to pay for routine
medical expenses from their account and to keep the unspent funds
for future health care needs, thus creating incentives for shopping
around and wise spending.  Medical expenditures from the MSAs
are applied against the deductible until the deductible (out-of-pocket
expense) is met, at which point the insurance coverage begins.
<p>
<center><h3>PRIVATE COMPANIES UTILIZE MSAs</h3></center>
<p>
Because of these positive features, more than 2,000 large and
small companies have begun offering MSAs to their employees, with
great success, even though current federal law does not exempt
contributions to such accounts.   Interestingly, seven states
have achieved tax fairness in their state income tax codes by
exempting contributions to MSAs.
<p>
A March 1995 Cato Institute study analyzed several companies and
states that provide MSAs, noting dramatic cost-savings and improvement
in customer satisfaction.  Consider these two examples:
<p><blockquote>
Dramatic savings from using MSAs have also been achieved at Windham
Hospital in Willimantic, Conn., with 1,000 employees.  In 1993
the hospital switched from a pure first-dollar coverage plan with
no deductible or co-payments to a plan with a $500 deductible.
 It also contributes $10 per week, or $520 per year, to an MSA
for each worker.  In addition, the hospital negotiated discounts
for its employees when they pay for health services with MSA funds.
 The hospital itself offers discounts of 30 percent, area doctors
offer price reductions of 20 percent, and drugstores cut prices
by 10 percent.
<p>
Under the old plan, the hospital's employees used medical services
35 percent more than the community average.  After one year under
the new plan, however, the entire 35 percent excess was eliminated.
 Moreover, projected health costs for the hospital employees were
reduced by about 50 percent.
<p></blockquote>
The study even cites the case of The United Mine Workers Union
that successfully negotiated for MSAs in their contract. 
<p><blockquote>
Under an agreement with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,
covering about 15,000 employees, coal mine operators now provide
workers insurance with a $1,000 deductible replacing a zero deductible
under the old health plan.  The employees are each provided a
$1,000 cash bonus at the beginning of the year that they can use
for health care expenses below the deductible.  At the end of
the year, workers can keep for any use whatsoever any portion
of the bonus they do not use for health care.
<p></blockquote>
<center><h3>HELP FOR LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES</h3></center>
<p>
Companies that have MSAs have found they are most popular among
lower-income employees.  Under conventional insurance plans, low-income
employees would have to meet their $250 or $500 deductible with
after-tax dollars before they could access their insurance.  A
single mother earning $14,000 or $15,000 a year may find it difficult
to meet the deductible when rent, transportation, taxes, grocery
bills and other needs for her children are pressing.  An MSA allows
these low-income earners first dollar coverage, permitting them
to get medical care when they or their children need it.  This
feature alone could significantly reduce the level of emergency
room utilization for non-emergency care.  Low-income wage earners
would have, in effect, first-dollar coverage for medical care
up to the amount in their MSA.
<p>
<center><h3>LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS IN CONGRESS</h3></center>
<p>
Congress has proposed several variations of MSA legislation, but
generally this legislation has been designed to end the current
tax discrimination against MSAs.  MSAs are flexible and would
operate as a <I>tax-free</I>, portable account which can be used
to pay medical bills (including those for eyeglasses and dental
care), in conjunction with a high-deductible (or &quot;catastrophic&quot;)
health insurance plan.  Contributions made by employers, the self-employed
or individuals would be tax-free.  If one needs to withdraw money
for non-medical expenses, the funds are taxed and a 10 percent
penalty applies.
<p>
MSA proposals have gained bipartisan support but have never passed
in Congress.  Now, the 104th Congress has the chance to pass an
MSA bill, such as the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act
of 1995, H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps. Bill Archer (R-Texas)
and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.).  This bill allows contributions made
to MSAs by employers, the self-employed, and individuals to be
tax-deductible.  Through tax fairness, the bill also helps the
uninsured, future senior citizens, and employed mothers, who will
no longer be forced to accept full-time employment to receive
tax-deductible health coverage.  The estimated cost of H.R. 1818
is $1.77 billion over seven years, according to the Joint Committee
on Taxation.  Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) recently introduced
a virtually  identical MSA proposal in the Senate, S. 1247. 
<p>
Under H.R. 1818 and S. 1247, there are annual limits on the amount
of money that can be placed in such accounts ($2,500 for an individual
or $5,000 for a family).  A 10 percent penalty is levied if the
money is withdrawn for non-medical expenses.  In addition, money
for non-medical expenses is also taxed as income, since the money
was deposited tax free.  As in the case of IRAs, a 10 percent
penalty would encourage savings and discourage frivolous non-medical
spending. 
<p>
The MSA is essentially a trust created exclusively for the purpose
of paying qualified medical expenses (QME) of the account holder
and his or her family.   Distributions for QMEs are excluded from
gross income.  QMEs are defined by section 213 (d) of the IRS
code, except that MSA expenses for insurance premiums other than
catastrophic plans or long-term care insurance premiums would
not be included.
<p>
H.R. 1818 has passed the House Ways and Means Committee and will
be included in the budget reconciliation package for consideration
under &quot;closed rules&quot; on the House floor.  That means
no amendments may be offered.  The reconciliation bill is an omnibus
&quot;must-pass&quot; budget package slated for a vote in October.

</pre><p>
<ul>
<li>In  S. 1247, the amount of deposit is limited to the deductible
amount of the insurance policy or $2,500 for an individual or
$5,000 for a family.
<p>
<li>If this is used up in a year, the traditional or catastrophic
insurance plan kicks in. 
<p>
<li>If this is not used up in a year, the remainder can be retained
in the MSA to be used for next year's health expenses, or future
retirement (IRA) needs.
<p>
<li>Long-term care insurance policies can be purchased from the
MSA account.
<p>
<li>People laid-off or unemployed can use MSA funds to continue
to purchase high-deductible private health insurance.
</ul><p>
Let's say an employer, for example, will spend $4,000 per year
on health insurance for an individual.  The employer decides to
use that $4,000 for an MSA for his employee.  The employer purchases
a high-deductible insurance policy which costs $2,000 per year.
 The policy has a deductible of $2,500.  The employer then deposits
$2,000 into the MSA, from which the employee draws to meet routine
medical expenses.  Therefore, as an equation, the example above
would look like this: 
<p>
<center>
$4,000  =  $2,000 in premium costs for a health insurance policy<br>
with a $2,500 deductible  +  $2,000 deposited in the MSA
</center><p>
Next year, the employer deposits another $2,000 (usually in monthly
allotments) in the employee's MSA.  If the employee only spent
$1,000 the first year, then the employee would have $1,000 left
in the MSA at the beginning of the second year, when that year's
$2,000 would be deposited.  Therefore, the employee would have
$3,000 in the MSA at the beginning of the second year.  
<p>
Once initially set up, an MSA is useful in times of temporary
unemployment or in-between jobs.  The same <I>Journal of American
Health Policy</I> (cited above) reports that &quot;41 percent
of persons losing private health insurance have an uninsured spell
that ends within one to three months, and 71 percent have a dry
spell that ends within four months.&quot;   The &quot;portable&quot;
feature of  MSAs can prevent &quot;job lock&quot; - that is, a
situation in which someone feels &quot;forced&quot; to remain
in a job because of fear of losing good health benefits.   Those
unfortunate families who are chronically unemployed or earning
wages below the poverty level, will still be eligible for public
health programs, such as Medicaid and SSI, which will continue
to provide aid to the working poor.
<p>
<center><h3>TYPICAL FEATURES OF  H.R. 1818/S. 1247:</h3></center>
<p><ul>
<I>* tax free account, similar to IRA, for medical expenses</I><br>
<I>* employer or individual makes contribution (limit $)</I><br>
<I>* choose own doctor</I><br>
<I>* portable </I><br>
<I>* money in account rolls over year to year </I><br>
<I>* no claims, no new government bureaucracy or administrative
costs</I><br>
<I>* can withdraw savings for retirement at 59 1/2 years old</I><br>
<I>* 10 percent penalty for withdrawal for non-medical use</I><br>
<p></ul>
<center><h3>MEDICARE</h3></center>
<p>
As one possible alternative to Medicare, both House and Senate
committees have proposed  tax-free &quot;Medisave&quot; accounts,
similar to those proposed for working families, as a potential
option for seniors.  In the future, these Medisave accounts have
the potential to save seniors and the health care system money
by allowing personal account funds to be used to pay for expenses
not covered by the traditional health insurance plan, such as
prescription drugs or long-term care insurance premiums.   If
the money is spent wisely, there will be money left in the account
for next year's health expenses or for non-medical expenses (with
a small penalty).  This will help give the elderly and their families
an opportunity to best use the money.  It takes decisions away
from the Washington bureaucrats.  The House Ways and Means and
Senate Finance Committees have approved a medical savings account
option that combines a high-deductible insurance policy with a
Medicare MSA.   
<p>
<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>
<p>
FRC believes Medical Savings Accounts are family-friendly health
care reform.  Ultimately, all health care reform legislation should
be judged within the following family-based guidelines:  
<p><ul>
<li>Fosters Genuine Compassion
<li>Makes Prudence Pay
<li>Promotes Family Autonomy
<li>Recognizes the Family's Contribution to Good Health
<li>Empowers Families to Act

<h2>YOUTH GANGS: OUT OF<br>
CONTROL AND GETTING<br>
WORSE</h2>

<p>
A recent decline in violent crime appears to be more a result
of fewer teenagers than better law enforcement.  When the current
bumper crop of elementary-age children become adolescents, the
violent crime rate is likely to explode.
<p>
A growing chorus of experts warn of the impending youth crime
crisis.  Reggie Walton, a Washington, D.C. Superior Court judge
who handles juvenile cases, blames it on the disappearance of
fathers.  Walton says fathers leave children to be raised by young
mothers who themselves are often struggling with mental or emotional
problems, limited education, poverty and addiction.  Walton labels
these children &quot;walking time bombs.&quot;[1]
<p>
This time bomb has been in the making for some time.  Youth violent
crime has been rising dramatically for more than a decade.  Today,
and historically, young males commit far more crimes than other
age groups.
<p>
The volatile mix of more chronic juvenile delinquents and an upward
surge in youthful perpetrators of violence is complemented by
an unprecedented growth in youth living with little or no adult
supervision.  Consider some recent examples.
<p><ul>
<li>A Los Angeles family takes a wrong turn into gang territory
and is fired upon.  A 3-year-old is killed and her 2-year-old
brother wounded.
<p><li>A Chinese immigrant in Brooklyn is kidnapped by a Chinatown
gang which demands ransom payments from her family.  She is murdered
when the family fails to pay.
<p><li>Two FBI agents and a police sergeant are murdered inside the
Washington, D.C. police headquarters by a gang member.
<p><li>A Pittsburgh police sergeant walking home with his daughter
is killed with his own gun after he stops and confronts a gang
spraying graffiti on a street.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>WALKING TIME BOMBS</h3></center>
<p>
Vice President Albert Gore recently told the White House press
corps, &quot;Gangs have been a major cause of the growth in violent
crime in the past decade.&quot;[2] He cited a Treasury Department
report that found the presence of rival gangs, the Bloods and
the Crips, in 35 states and 58 cities across the country.
<p>
At the same press conference, Attorney General Janet Reno cited
the impact of disabling one gang in New Haven, Connecticut.  Eighteen
members of the &quot;Jungleboy&quot; street gang were put in jail,
and, according to Reno, New Haven's murder rate fell by one-third
in 1993.[3]
<p>
Given that youth gangs account for a disproportionate share of
youth violence, their potential for contributing to a future crime
wave is enormous.
<p>
At the current growth rate, there will be nearly half-a-million
more adolescent boys in the year 2010 than today.  That means
if current trends continue, we will have perhaps 30,000 more chronic
juvenile delinquents by the year 2010 than today.  Chronic youth
offenders comprise 7 percent of all male teenagers and they commit
70 percent of all serious crime for their age group.[4]
<p>
If history is any predictor, these adolescents will be more violent
than the current delinquents.  According to the Department of
Justice, today's youth are extremely violent.  Firearms are now
used by three-fourths of all juvenile homicide offenders and 
one-third of all reported violent crime offenders are less than
21 years old.  Juvenile arrests for all violent crime have increased
from 1983 to 1992 in spite of the decline in the overall number
of teenagers in the U.S. population.  The government estimates
that the juvenile arrest rate for major violent crime will more
than double by the year 2010.[5]
<p>
This ticking youth time bomb is evident everywhere.  California
authorities report that incarcerations of violent youth increased
from 44 percent of the prison population in 1987 to 61 percent
in 1992[6]. There is no sign of a turnaround.  Officials in the
upscale Washington, D.C. suburb of Fairfax, Virginia, report that
the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has climbed
61 percent since 1991.  The number of youth arrested with weapons
has risen 118 percent since 1989.[7]
<p>
A 1993 report by the Washington State Department of Community
Development states, &quot;Our state and nation are awash in a
tidal wave of violence, violence that has reached epidemic proportions
especially among our youngest generation.&quot;[8]
<p>
Professor Dean Rojek, a sociologist at the University of Georgia,
says, &quot;For decades violent crime was driven mostly by adults,
with kids involved mostly in property crime....What's been changing is 
that you have juveniles becoming much more involved in violent offenses, 
with the use of weapons. If we add to this more babies, you could have a 
multiplier effect...a mini explosion [in violent crime by youth].&quot;[9]
<p>
Attorney General Janet Reno agrees.  &quot;Unless we act now,&quot;
says Reno, &quot;to stop young people from choosing a life of
violence and crime, the beginning of the 21st century could bring
levels of violent crime to our community that far exceed what
we have experienced.&quot;[10]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM</h3></center>
<p>
The bomb's fuse is shortened by the youth gang phenomenon.  California
authorities describe the youth gang as a &quot;violent and insidious
new form of organized crime.  Heavily armed with sophisticated
weapons, (gangs) are involved in drug trafficking, witness intimidation,
extortion, and bloody territorial wars.  In some cases they are
traveling out of state to spread their violence and crime.&quot;[11]
<p>
According to the FBI,  &quot;The fastest growing murder circumstance
is juvenile gang killings.&quot;[12] Almost one-third of Los Angeles'
homicides are gang related.[13] Nationwide, the rate of violent offenses
by gang members is three times as high as for non-gang delinquents.[14]
<p>
There's something about young males belonging to a gang that makes
them more violent.
<p><ul>
<li>Orange County, California probation statistics indicate that
gang-related youth had significantly higher law-violation rates (55.1 percent) 
than non-gang affiliated youth (26.4 percent).[15] A study of 20 years of 
data collected by Philadelphia's police gang unit shows that &quot;gangs
engage in more violent behavior than do delinquent non-gang groups.&quot;[16]
<p>
<li>Metropolitan Life surveyed schools about gang violence.  It
found that more than half (59 percent) of law enforcement and one-third (34 
percent) of students and teachers say gang or group membership is a major
cause of violence in schools.[17]
<p>
<li>A study in Wisconsin found that most violent crimes by youths
were committed by groups of three or more.  This &quot;pack&quot; behavior, 
not surprisingly, seems to be at the core of much of the rise in youth
crime.[18]
<p>
<li>A study of New York City teenage gunshot victims found that
40 percent were shot during school hours.  Another study found that of 
children and teenagers wounded in drive-by shootings in Los Angeles, 71 
percent were &quot;documented members of street gangs.&quot;[19]
<p></ul>
Not only do gang members tend to be more violent than non-gang
members, but gang membership appears to prolong one's criminal
career.  One study found that a &quot;large portion of persistent
and dangerous juvenile gang offenders become even more serious
adult offenders.&quot;[20] Another study in California found that
previously-incarcerated gang members continued their lives of
crime after being released.[21]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS - AN AMERICAN PHENOMENON?</h3></center>
<p>
As early as the 1600s, London was &quot;terrorized by a series
of organized gangs...[who] fought pitched battles among themselves
dressed with colored ribbons to distinguish the different factions.&quot;[22]
 Gang problems have been reported in most of Europe, the former
Soviet Union, Africa, South America, Mexico, New Zealand and Japan.
<p>
One of the first reports of youth gangs in America comes from
Philadelphia.  In 1791, that city's leaders convened a conference
to decide how to deal with bands of disruptive youth.[23]
<p>
New York City had a similar problem in the 19th century.  New
York's gangs tended to be political agents for the Know Nothing
or Native American Party.  During the early Civil War years there
were draft riots which may have been started by Irish street gangs.[24]
<p>
The classic movie, <I>West Side Story</I>, is stereotypical of
20th century gang life.  The Sharks and the Jets are territorial
gangs protecting their neighborhoods.  Until recently, however,
gangs like these were not considered a threat to the general population.
<p>
Neither a 1967 presidential commission on law enforcement nor
the 1976 National Advisory Committee on Criminal Standards and
Goals foresaw today's gang problem. They concluded, &quot;Youth
gangs are not now or [sic] should not become a major object of
concern....Youth gang violence is not a major problem in the United
States....What gang violence does exist can fairly readily be
diverted into 'constructive' channels, especially through the
provision of services by community agencies.&quot;[25]
<p>
<center><h3>WHY ARE GANGS SPREADING?</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are spreading across the country and are not just limited
to major cities.  Bernard Friedlander, a University of Hartford psychology 
professor and a violence expert, says, &quot;This is an American problem, 
not an inner-city problem....It's spreading slowly....On one level it's 
simple fad imitation...but on another level the
isolation of youth is just as profound in some of the more stable
areas as in the inner city.&quot;[26]
<p>
Ed Edelman, a Los Angeles supervisor, said, &quot;Gangs are very
mobile today.  They don't just stay in one area.  They are not just limited 
to poor areas of the country.  They are all over the place.&quot;[27]
<p>
The spread of gangs can be attributed to at least three factors.
 First, parents, desiring to protect their gang-culture-saturated
children from the hometown gang's influence, send them to relatives
across the country.  Sometimes this strategy works.  But many
times it merely helps transplant the gang culture into a new community.
<p>
The drug trade has created entrepreneurial gangs which fan out
across the country to ply their trade and expand their markets.
 Franchises of the Bloods and the Crips are now in most metropolitan
centers.  With their expansion, they have introduced collateral,
gang-like violence.
<p>
Finally, the entertainment industry contributes to the spread
of gangs.  The gang culture, value system and mentality are sprinkled
across the country through movies, &quot;gangsta&quot; rap music
and now comic books.  These cultural amplifiers educate young
audiences to gang values and attitudes.  They denigrate women,
promote exaggerated manhood or  &quot;machismo,&quot; and glorify
violence.  They also pass on gang language, symbols, activities,
and traditions.[28]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG NUMBERS, LOCATION AND TYPES</h3></center>
<p>
According to Justice Department estimates, the United States has
some 1,436 gangs and 120,636 gang members.  They exist in large,
mid-sized and small communities and in suburban areas.[29]
<p>
The Justice Department figures are disputed by the National School
Safety Center, which in 1993 estimated that the Los Angeles area
alone has at least 959 gangs with approximately 125,000 gang members.[30]
 Another report states that more than 350,000 gang members reside
along the West Coast.[31] To further confuse the issue, a 1975 study
found a total of 760 to 2,700 gangs in the nation's eight largest
cities.[32]
<p>
There are many types of gangs.  Some are black, white, Asian,
Hispanic or other ethnic-centered gangs.  Others are structured
around territory, commercial activities, corporate businesses,
political agendas, religion, music and special types of crime.
<p><ul>
<li><B>Race/ethnic-based gangs</B>:  Larry Rawles, deputy director
of Philadelphia's Crisis Intervention Network, says, &quot;When any ethnic 
group was at the bottom, they formed gangs -- the Jews, the Irish, the 
Italians.&quot;[33] Gangs offered status, a sense of self-worth, 
and protection.  Today, most gangs are racially segregated (54.6
percent are African American and 32.6 percent are Hispanic).  Blacks and 
Hispanics constitute the largest numbers of youths arrested for gang 
offenses today.[34]
<p>
The all-black rival gangs, the Crips and the Bloods, have an estimated
70,000 members in Los Angeles County alone.[35] They have franchises
in most states and metropolitan communities where they tend to
dominate the crack cocaine trade.
<p>
Darlyne Pettinicchio, a probation officer in Orange County, California,
says, &quot;(White gangs are) punk rockers and heavy metalers
(who) come from all socio-economic classes.  They're of average
intelligence and they're capable youngsters.  They have very little
parental authority.  They're usually angry.  Their dance is violent.
 Their music is violent.  Their behavior is violent.  They're
into anarchy.&quot;[36]
<p>
There are numerous Hispanic, Satanic cult, Asian, and Stoner (punk
rock and heavy metal) gangs.  Each has a subculture and each tends
to be very violent and involved in the use and or distribution
of illicit drugs.
<p>
<li><B>Economic-based gangs</B>:  Some gangs are organized around
a commercial activity. Members may be all from a single race or the same 
neighborhood or they may be very diverse.  The glue that holds them together
is making money.
<p>
They often see themselves as Robin Hoods or Bonnie-and-Clyde types
who practice their own version of free enterprise.  A close cousin
is the corporate gang, which selects a type of industry or business
and dominates the field through intimidation and violence.   For
example, there was a Miami-based gang called the &quot;Mazda boys&quot;
who specialized in stealing Mazda cars.
<p>
<li><B>Territorial gangs</B>:  Territorial gangs can be from any
race or ethnic background. They lay claim to a particular territory. They 
typically &quot;tag&quot; their territory with gang graffiti and are 
willing to defend their turf to the death. When their territory is invaded 
the gang provides &quot;warriors.&quot;
<p></ul>
<center><h3>WHO JOINS A GANG?</h3></center>
<p>
No matter the type of gang, most gang members are male.  A Chicago
study of four police districts found that only 2 to 5 percent
of gang arrestees were female.[37] These females are typically auxiliary
gang members.
<p>
Gang members range in age from 8 to 22 years old, but there are
exceptions where tenure is often well beyond 22 to perhaps more
than 40 years old.[38] A counselor in a juvenile detention facility
in California said: &quot;(If) you find a gang member who comes
from a complete nuclear family, a kid who has never been exposed
to any kind of abuse, I'd like to meet him....a real 'gangbanger'
who comes from a happy, balanced home, who's got a good opinion
of himself.  I don't think that kid exists.&quot;[39]
<p>
Sydney Harris, a nationally syndicated columnist, said, &quot;Gang
members tend to be chronic losers, who can accomplish nothing
individually, or who live in so depressed an environment that
only by banding together can they exercise any influence over
their lives.  In both cases, they are as much to be pitied as
condemned.&quot;[40]
<p>
Allen Frazier, superintendent of schools for Plymouth, Connecticut,
blames economic problems.  &quot;As people have more economic
problems in the adult world,&quot; says Frazier, &quot;it transfers
to the young people as well....[The children] don't seem to have
a place where they are comfortable.  In order to seek that, sometimes
they end up with the security of a gang....It becomes an extended
family which they may not have.&quot;[41]
<p>
A gang researcher says, &quot;These gang kids have nothing to
do that they perceive as useful.  They are the disconnected, alienated
ones.  They identify with whatever is trendy in terms of music,
clothes, and in terms of behavior.  They are living entirely on
the surface of life.&quot;[42]
<p>
Prisons are often referred to as gang training schools.  Often
gangs are formed in prison and then emigrate to the streets. 
The cohesion associated with jail time amplifies gang loyalty.
<p>
Fred Williams, the executive director for Common Ground Foundation,
a Watts [Los Angeles, California] nonprofit organization that
works with gang youth, says, &quot;Prison doesn't scare them.
 It's a home away from home.&quot;[43]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG CULTURE</h3></center>
<p>
Professor Cornel West, a Princeton University social scholar,
says in his book <I>Race Matters</I> that the nihilistic thinking
of the inner city black community sets the stage for gang formation.
 West says, &quot;The frightening result is a numbing detachment
from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world.
 Life without meaning, hope, and love breeds a cold-hearted, mean-spirited
outlook that destroys both the individual and others.&quot;[44]
<p>
The youth gang satisfies a void.  It provides the child a sense
of identity, belonging, power, and protection.  The gang satisfies
the child's desire to feel secure.  Living in a high-risk environment
without paternal protection, the young gangster satisfies his
insecurities by aligning himself with a gang, his surrogate family.
 The gang provides a protective barrier against the outside forces.
<p>
One gang member says, &quot;Being in a gang means if I didn't
have no family, I think that's where I'll be.  If I didn't have
no job that's where I'd be.  To me it's community help without
all the community.  They'll understand better than my mother and
father.&quot;[45]
<p>
His new &quot;family&quot; has a distinct set of values that affect
every aspect of his life.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney, the gang culture is radically different from the mainline
culture.  &quot;It confronts and confounds adult authority on
every level -- sex, work, power, love, education, language, dress,
music, drugs, alcohol, violence.  As icons of popular culture,
gangs not only represent a powerful group identity utterly inaccessible
to adults, they are surrounded with an appealing aura of outlaw
danger.&quot;[46]
<p>
Visible manifestations of the gang culture include colors, signs,
symbols, graffiti, and tattoos.  Gang colors, different types
of clothing and head covering help distinguish one gang from another.
 Even some National Football League players who are connected
to gangs wear gang-colored bandanas.
<p>
Gangs often have their peculiar vocabulary.  Many black street
gangs address each other as &quot;cuz&quot; for cousin.  They
often have code words and many speak like &quot;rappers.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tagging&quot; their territory with gang graffiti is common.
 It proclaims the presence of the gang and offers a challenge
to rivals.  It may claim credit for a crime.  The denser the graffiti,
the closer one is to the gang's core territory.  The Crips often
mark &quot;B/K&quot; for &quot;Bloods killers.&quot;
<p>
Gang behavior is characterized by extreme loyalty.  Members never
inform on &quot;homeboys,&quot; even if faced with death.  Once
in a gang, the member faces long odds of ever leaving alive.
<p>
Captain Russell Holyfield of the Hartford Police Department describes
gang protocol.  &quot;You give someone a dirty look,&quot; says
Holyfield, &quot;or say something about their girlfriend and later
on that day, you're a target.&quot;[47]
<p>
A Los Angeles District Attorney gang study describes the macho-psychology
of the gang culture.  &quot;The gang's ideal man is virtually
identical to the romantic myth of the gunfighter of the Old West
-- a two-fisted, hard-drinking, dangerous man who is quick to
avenge any insult; he lives and dies by violence, with his exploits
rousing fear and respect in the hearts of men, and in the hearts
of women, fear and desire.&quot;[48]
<p>
&quot;Gangsta&quot; rap is filled with messages that glorify violence,
extreme abuse of women and disrespect for authority.  The rapper's
lyrics paint a realistic picture of daily gangster activity.
<p>
Despite this, some gangs have an odd sense of civility.  A Los
Angeles Hispanic gang member says, &quot;When I'm out on the streets,
I know I'm safe if I'm with my mom.  You don't disrespect anybody
if they are with their mom.&quot;[49]
<p>
Partying and fighting, the core activities of a gang, are what
draw many young males.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney's report, &quot;These are the things that build and define
group loyalties.  Even criminality, which is probably the public's
main perception of what gangs are about, is less a core value
of the gang than a byproduct of the emphasis on partying and fighting.&quot;[50]
<p>
Sergeant Joe Guzman with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department
explains prison's influence on the gang culture:  &quot;One prison
gang member might see that another gang member had something he
wanted.  If he was larger, more powerful or had more back-up from
his 'homeboys' than the other inmate, he literally just took the
item he wanted.  If he was angered in one fashion or another he
retaliated with deadly vengeance and commanded the presence of
his entire gang to back him up.&quot;[51]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG ORGANIZATION</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are loosely organized.  Some are part of larger structures
known as &quot;nations,&quot; which are networked nationwide.
 But most are loosely knit groups with several leaders.
<p>
The 1960 New York City Youth Board proposed a theory of gang structure,
stating gangs are structured both vertically and horizontally.
 The vertical gang is structured along age lines and draws members
from local neighborhoods.  The horizontal gang has older members
who are drawn from a larger area.[52] This type of gang tends to
evolve into coalitions, supergangs and nations.  The term &quot;supergang&quot;
was coined in Chicago in the late 1960s to describe a gang with
thousands of members.[53]
<p>
Virtually every gang is built from groups called &quot;cliques.&quot;
 One gang researcher called the clique a &quot;spontaneous interest
group usually of the conflict type which forms itself within some
larger social structure such as a gang.&quot;[54] Members of cliques
tend to be similar in age.
<p>
Gang leaders are chosen by natural selection based on the person's
age, physical stature, arrest record and behavior.  Like any organization,
according to one researcher, the &quot;ability to get along with
people is one of the basic skills associated with gang leadership.&quot;[55]
<p>
Some gangs have formal leaders known as king, prince, prime minister,
general, don, or chief .  Others are informal, known as &quot;shot
callers&quot; or &quot;shooters.&quot;   Leadership responsibilities
may be shared and based upon a &quot;collection of functions that
may be undertaken at various times by a number of members.&quot;[56]
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
&quot;We've got so many kids out there who've lost hope, who believe
in only living for today,&quot; says John Turner, chief of police
for the city of Mountlake Terrace, Washington. &quot;They join
a gang and get involved in criminal activity because there aren't
any people taking them by the hand in simple terms and pointing
them in the right direction, giving them self-esteem and positive
feedback.&quot;[57]
<p>
Perhaps gangs exist because modern society has failed to harness
the male hunter/predator instinct and converted those energies
to familial provider/protector efforts.  Delinquent young people
lacking values, conscience or a sense of remorse can easily find
themselves drawn to the gang lifestyle.
<p>
Noted author James Q. Wilson writes in <I>The Moral Sense</I>
that modern society with its &quot;rapid technological change,
intense division of labor, and ambiguous allocation of social
roles, frequently leaves some men out, with their aggressive predispositions
either uncontrolled or undirected.  Gangs are one result.&quot;[58]
<p>
Wilson says the profits from illegal drug sales provide gang members
economic opportunities which combine with their uncontrolled aggression
to develop a &quot;warrior culture that underinvests in family
life.&quot;
<p>
Converting male energy to familial provider/protector efforts
has always been the task of the intact family.  But the nuclear
family is declining, especially in predominantly black inner cities
where gangs dominate life and rain violent crime.  Many of these
children join gangs to find purpose, security, and self-esteem.
 The gang culture gives them a sense of belonging and remakes
their value system.  Partying, fighting, and vicious gang loyalty
become their primary values, thus pushing aside virtues that favor
family life.  This is a vicious cycle and it must be broken.
<p>
Defusing the youth crime bomb must include a strategy to dismantle
the growing youth gang movement.  Gangs are the powder magazine
-- they must be dealt with before the bomb goes off.

<title>CONGRESS MAY FORM A COMMISSION TO STUDY LEGALIZED GAMBLING</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<p>
<h2>CONGRESS MAY FORM A<br>
COMMISSION TO STUDY<br>
LEGALIZED GAMBLING</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
America is experiencing a wave of legalized gambling. Some consider
government-sponsored betting a financial godsend, but for others
it is a social and economic disaster that will stop only when
the public says enough is enough.
<p>
Gambling has grown in an ad hoc manner with states and cities
emulating others that appear to be successful. Officials look
with envy as citizens go to other states and cities to wager.
But as one politician who led the battle to legalize gambling
in Atlantic City warned, &quot;Casino gambling is not a 'try it
and see' experiment. Once the casino opens and the dice begin
to roll, gambling creates an instant constituency. People depend
on it for jobs. Governments depend on it for revenues.&quot;[1]
<p>
Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) has introduced legislation intended to
discover the true nature of gambling. Wolf's bill, the National
Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act, calls for the creation
of a two-year commission to study gambling. The Act was approved
by voice vote November 8, 1995, by the House Judiciary Committee
and is expected to see House floor debate in 1996.[2]
<p>
A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Paul Simon
(D-Ill.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.).[3] The proposed commission will
examine policies and practices with respect to legalization or
prohibition of gambling and make recommendations for legislation
and administrative action.
<p>
This legislation is considered necessary because of the gradual
creation of 37 state lotteries and the expansion of casino gambling
to 23 states (prompted in part by the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act of 1988) as well as an avalanche of gaming promoters selling
government officials on the economic benefits of legalization.
These sponsors sell legalization as an economic boon and a harmless
recreational pastime, but there is considerable evidence that
this rush to easy money actually costs the taxpayer more than
it harvests.
<p>
Columnist William Safire speaks for many when he labels gambling
&quot;a $40-billion-a-year industry that is inherently immoral,
corrupting public officials, enriching criminals, addicting and
impoverishing the young and the vulnerable.&quot;[4] He supports
the legislation now pending in the 104th Congress.
<p>
According to Congressman Wolf's bill, the proposed federal commission
would consider 11 broad areas. The following summarizes what is
already known about some of these areas.
<p>
<center><h3>ECONOMIC IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Tunica County, Mississippi was known as the poorest county in
the country. In January 1992, it had an unemployment rate of 26.2
percent and a per capita income of $11,865. More than half of
its citizens were on food stamps.[5]
<p>
Since legalized gambling came to Tunica County, land values have
skyrocketed from $250 to $25,000 per acre. Over a billion dollars
in building permits have been granted. The nine area casinos each
average 1,000 employees, bringing unemployment down to 4.9 percent.
Child support collections have doubled, welfare benefits have
been nearly halved, food stamp recipients have decreased and property
taxes have been cut one-third.[6]
<p>
Webster Franklin, executive director of the Tunica County chamber
of commerce, is a gambling fan. He told a House committee in September
1995 that gambling is the best thing to happen to his county.
<p>
Such reports cause officials of money-strapped government agencies
to salivate. Detroit, for example, equates casinos with economic
salvation. For years, gambling citizens have crossed the Detroit
River to make wagers in Canada.
<p>
John Kelly, a lawyer and former Michigan state senator who opposed
gambling when he was in the legislature, now works for a local
investment group. He said the presence of Canadian casinos across
the river has been persuasive to him. He wants Detroit to reap
some of the profit from gambling rather than watch locals cross
the border to wager. Michigan Governor John Engler has appointed
an 11-member commission to study whether an Indian-run casino
would benefit the city.[7]
<p>
The story in Mobile, Alabama, is quite different. Mayor Mike Dow
believed that $63 million was spent by Alabama residents at nearby
Gulfport, Mississippi gambling casinos. When Mayor Dow investigated
bringing casinos to his city, he found the price was too high.
<p>
Forty-one of Mobile's social service agency CEO's were tasked
to determine the probable effects of introducing casinos. The
five-month study found that introducing casinos would cost the
city $15 million more each year in increased social service costs.
<p>
Charles White, CEO, Franklin Memorial Health Care Center of Mobile,
said, &quot;Our social service staff is already seeing an impact
from casinos in Mississippi....We see families selling their food
stamps and WIC vouchers for gambling money, and we are aware of
one family who lost its home.&quot;[8]
<p>
Joyce Collier, executive director of Mobile's Family Counseling
Center, states: &quot;[in the Biloxi/Gulfport area] families have
lost everything that they have worked for in terms of physical
holdings....Some clients have pawned car titles and lost transportation....Our
family counselors report increased alcohol and drug abuse and
spouse abuse.&quot;[9]
<p>
In 1994, Florida governor Lawton Chiles sponsored an economic
impact study of gambling. He found that Florida could anticipate
gambling revenues ranging from $324 to $469 million each year,
but that collateral costs outstripped the gain. Sales tax revenues
would drop $84.7 million, and crime and social costs attributable
to casinos were estimated to reach between $2.16 and $3.8 billion
annually.[10]
<p>
University of Nevada professor of public administration William
Thompson explained Florida's dilemma. Casinos generate significant
new tax revenues &quot;only if they can export their product.
The local economy doesn't benefit if only local people are gambling.&quot;[11]
Florida's geography is unlike Atlantic City and Las Vegas, which
draw gamblers from other states and send them packing with the
residue of gambling pathologies. That tab is absorbed by the gamblers'
home states. But Florida believes most of its potential gamblers
would be residents and not out-of-state tourists.
<p>
National gambling expert Robert Goodman studied the industry's
claims of economic benefits for the Ford Foundation and the Aspen
Institute. He says there is a critical lack of objective knowledge
and research about the real economic and social costs and benefits
of legalizing gambling. He warns that the research often used
by public officials tends to be unbalanced because it has been
provided by the gambling industry.[12]
<p>
Goodman's 1994 study analyzed 14 gambling industry studies concluding
that &quot;hiding the costs&quot; of gambling was widespread and
gambling acted as &quot;economic cannibalism&quot; on pre-existing
economies and other businesses.[13]
<p>
John Kindt, a professor of commerce at the University of Illinois,
has estimated that for every dollar that states take in from gambling
they pay three dollars to social agencies and crime fighting.
A problem gambler costs the state an average of $13,000 a year
in social impact.[14]
<p>
<center><h3>IMPACT ON BUSINESS</h3></center>
<p>
Louisiana gambled and is now paying the price. That state legalized
riverboat gambling and a few land-based casinos several years
ago. Recent events show the error of that decision.
<p>
Mike Foster, a Republican who ran on an anti-gambling platform,
was recently elected governor. He promises a state referendum
on gambling's future within a year.[15]
<p>
Additionally, on November 22, 1995 Harrah's Jazz Company, a consortium
that was building a 200,000-square-foot casino on New Orleans's
Canal Street, filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law. This action caused the layoff of 3,500 workers
and a net loss of $23.6 million each year for the city. Why? Because
the temporary casino was doing poorly. Gambling investors miscalculated
the appeal of gambling.[16]
<p>
Gambling is leading many communities into economic distress. Atlantic
City has created 43,000 jobs over 10 years, but now the city has
only one business -- gambling. When casinos first came to Atlantic
City, there were 2,100 thriving small businesses. Today the number
is near 1,100 and falling. According to a New Jersey commission
report, &quot;It is clear that retail business and retail employment
in Atlantic City have continued to decline despite the presence
of gambling, and that rampant speculation has rendered the development
of vast parts of Atlantic City difficult if not impossible.&quot;[17]
<p>
In Illinois it was hoped that an economic facelift would result
when riverboats were introduced. But Earl L. Grinols, a University
of Illinois economist, examined the economic data in April 1994.
He found that &quot;riverboat gambling did not create the jobs
that were promised and had very little effect on reducing unemployment.&quot;[18]
He concluded, &quot;Economically speaking, it appears that riverboat
casinos shift jobs as opposed to creating jobs. For example, the
number of independent restaurants drops when a casino opens up.
Car sales have been known to go down with the onset of gambling.&quot;[19]
<p>
A survey by Chicago's Better Government Association (BGA) of 324
business owners in Illinois' riverboat towns found that a majority
said the floating casinos had no effect or a negative effect on
their businesses. BGA director J. Terrence Brunner said, &quot;Clearly,
riverboat gambling has not met the criteria set forth by Illinois
legislators when they sold this to the citizens of Illinois. The
economic development we found was marginal at best. It has not
spurred economic development. It has not created jobs. It has
not boosted tourism, and it certainly has not brought new life
to Illinois rivers or beautified their banks.&quot;[20]
<p>
Jeffrey Bloomberg, state's attorney, Lawrence County, South Dakota,
told the House Committee on Small Business on September 21, 1995,
that since 1988 when casino gambling was legalized for Deadwood,
South Dakota, life has been a nightmare. Real estate values have
skyrocketed, taxes have risen and gaming revenues have been eaten
up by increased administrative, law enforcement and infrastructure
costs.[21]
<p>
When casino gambling swept into three Colorado towns, it radically
changed life for the worse. According to a 1992 <I>Wall Street
Journal</I> article, &quot;[I]nstead of a few slot machines, full-blown
casinos owned by Las Vegas veterans and real-estate developers
have swept in, swallowing many mom-and-pop businesses along the
way. Water, sewer and traffic systems have been overwhelmed, crime
has increased, non-casino businesses face huge tax increases and
the relative calm of local politics has been shattered.&quot;[22]
<p>
Many communities with gambling experience are discovering the
hollow promises of the sponsors of this get-rich-quick industry.
Gambling creates many low paying jobs, diverts consumer dollars
into gambling, cannibalizes small businesses, and saddles those
that remain with burdensome tax liabilities. Gambling has a cumulative
negative economic impact.[23]
<p>
<center><h3>POLITICS AND PUBLIC POLICY IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
The gambling industry is sophisticated when it comes to getting
what it wants. Consider the Mashantucket Pequot Indians' gambling
operations in Connecticut.
<p>
Today, the 370-member Pequot tribe operates a 17-story, 1,229-room
hotel and casino facility that draws 50,000 visitors a day. The
facility is managed by Gerald Michael Brown, a former New Jersey
deputy attorney general. Brown recently failed to win state support
to expand Pequot gambling to Bridgeport, a New York City suburb,
but it wasn't for lack of trying.[24]
<p>
Brown hired a law firm for $100,000 a month to prowl the halls
of Connecticut's capitol to sway lawmakers. The Pequot tribe ran
television commercials and sent out direct mail appeals touting
the financial benefits for the taxpayer. The cumulative effort
cost the tribe $13 million over four years. The fact is that the
Pequots contribute more to the state coffers than any single organization.[25]
But in November 1995, the state senate, by a majority of 24-10,
shot down the proposal. Count on a comeback.
<p>
The Pequots are generous on the national scene as well. In 1994,
the tribe contributed $215,000 in soft money to the Democratic
party and $465,000 to the Republicans. The industry's total public
contributions for 1993-1994 were $1,642,229.[26] But that doesn't
account for all contributions.
<p>
In June 1995, Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., hosted
a fund-raiser for Senator Robert Dole (R-Kan.) that took in $477,450.
GOP chairman Haley Barbour isn't embarrassed by gambling money.
He said, &quot;It's not my place to be judgmental about issues
when it comes to allowing people to support us...you don't have
to agree with the Republican party on every issue to support us.&quot;[27]
<p>
Wynn is the genius behind the gaming industry's growth explosion,
according to John L. Smith, who writes in<I> Running Scared</I>
that Wynn has &quot;been accused of shadow-waltzing precariously
close to the wise-guy world.&quot; He dealt with a front man for
the Genovese crime family, and one of his associates was a point
man for Chicago mob lieutenant Johnny Rosselli, according to Smith,
who says Wynn was also associated with convicted junk bond felon
Michael Milken.[28]
<p>
The gambling industry understands the importance of politics.
That's why it hired Frank Fahrenkopf, a Nevada lawyer and former
Republican National Committee chairman. He now heads a $4 million
trade group, the American Gambling Association. This group, financed
by the gambling industry, promotes on Capitol Hill the positive
economic benefits of gambling.[29]
<p>
Gambling money and its agents have often been associated with
political corruption. Federal agents are investigating possible
political corruption in Louisiana. In 1995, senior state legislators
allegedly were caught discussing taking bribes from video-poker
lobbyists. Louisiana State Senator Jay Darnemme states, &quot;Greed,
arrogance, money and power -- it's all there....we went into this
very recklessly. Any states considering gambling ought not use
our formula as a model.&quot;[30]
<p>
The speaker of Missouri's House of Representatives resigned under
a cloud of gambling-related political corruption. In August 1991, FBI agents
in Columbia, South Carolina, wrapped up &quot;Operation Lost Trust,&quot;
which resulted in the bribery-related conviction of numerous legislators
and lobbyists.[31]
<p>
Six Arizona legislators pleaded guilty in 1990 to accepting gambling
bribes and that same year seven Kentucky officials were found
guilty of accepting bribes and making false statements. In 1994,
the West Virginia lottery director was sentenced to federal prison
for rigging a video lottery contract.[32]
<p>
The Clinton Administration has been cozy with the Seminole Tribe
of Florida. Clinton's Solicitor General, Drew Days, filed a last
minute, friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court siding
with the Seminole Indians' case against the state of Florida.
The Seminoles want casino gambling and say Florida has not been
faithful to the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
<p>
President Clinton's outsider support of the Seminoles waves a
red flag in the face of anti-gambling forces. A check of Florida-based
gaming contributors to the 1996 Clinton/Gore Primary Committee
Inc. found only $6,000, however.[33]
<p>
With annual wagers nationwide now topping half-a-trillion dollars
and gambling profits over $40 billion, there is great opportunity
for corruption.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING AND CRIME</h3></center>
<p>
On October 16, 1995, Joseph Curran, Jr., Maryland's attorney general,
published that state's analysis of the link between gambling and
crime. Curran said, &quot;Casinos would bring a substantial increase
in crime to our state.&quot;[34]
<p>
The Maryland report reflects what virtually every government that
has experienced gambling has found. Jeffrey Bloomberg said, when
casinos came to remote Deadwood, &quot;We have seen individuals
who, prior to their exposure to gambling, had no criminal history,
who were not junkies or alcoholics, many of whom had good jobs,
who became hooked on slot machines and, after losing all their
assets and running all credit resources to their maximum, began
committing some type of crime to support their addiction.&quot;[35]
<p>
Crime on Mississippi's gulf coast increased in every category
after legalization of gambling. Gulfport's chief of police found
overall crime increased more than 100 percent, juvenile crime
shot up 65 percent and alcohol-related accidents increased 101
percent.[36]
<p>
In the first three years after casinos came to Atlantic City,
it went from 50th to first in the nation in per capita crime.
In the first 15 years Atlantic City had casinos, violent crime
skyrocketed almost 500 percent. This was in spite of a 20 percent
population decrease.[37]
<p>
Crime rose 262 percent in Deadwood and police calls in Black Hawk,
Colorado increased from 25 per year before gaming, to as many
as 20,000 today.[38]
<p>
Congressman Wolf testified on September 29, 1995, &quot;Evidence
shows that pathological gamblers engage in forgery, theft, embezzlement,
drug dealing and property crimes to pay off gambling debts. Various
studies indicate that the mean gambling-related debt of people
in compulsive gambling therapy ranged from about $53,000 to $92,000.&quot;[39]
<p>
Durand F. Jacobs, a professor of psychiatry at California's Loma
Linda University and a gambling industry consultant, says that
most people who commit crimes to support their gambling had no
prior criminal records.[40]
<p>
Florida's Department of Law Enforcement studied the probable crime
impact of legalizing gambling and concluded it would cause an
increase in many crime categories. They include: robberies, rape,
theft, drug abuse, aggravated assault, counterfeiting, profit-skimming,
prostitution, credit card scams, loan sharking, and card cheats.[41]
<p>
Given the huge number of dollars involved, gambling legalization
attracts organized crime. Jim Moody, chief of the FBI'S Organized
Crime Section, told <I>60 Minutes</I>, &quot;Gambling itself --
is probably the biggest producer of money for the American La
Cosa Nostra [that] there is.&quot;[42] A former Chicago mobster told
a congressional committee, the introduction of legalized gaming
into Illinois &quot;created a brand new market for us.&quot;[43]
<p>
In 1995, 18 men linked to the Genovese and Gambino crime families
in New York and the Marcello crime family in New Orleans were
convicted of secretly trying to operate a video-poker company
in New Orleans.[44]
<p>
For these reasons Maryland's attorney general Curran warned, &quot;Whatever
dubious financial benefits might flow from casino gaming are outweighed
by the tremendous social costs. Casinos would forever damage the
quality of Maryland life. I urge the task force and the people
of this state to resist the temptation of money that would benefit
too few at the cost of too many.&quot;[45]
<p>
<center><h3>SOCIAL IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Americans make more trips to casinos than to major league ballparks,
making gambling the new national pastime. This is evidenced by
the creation of casinos in 23 states and a projection that, by
the year 2000, most Americans will be within a four-hour drive
of a casino.[46]
<p>
This phenomenon is not without social consequences. The American
Psychiatric Association says that gambling addiction parallels
the devastation of alcohol and drug addictions.[47] Although less
than 1 percent of the population have been identified as gambling
addicts, the legalization of gambling could cause that number
to grow to 5 percent, and that includes teenagers.[48]
<p>
Tom Fennelly, a counselor with Gamblers Anonymous, says people
with gambling problems wait to get help until they do something
that bothers their conscience. He told of one woman who became
a prostitute to pay for gambling.[49]
<p>
Robert Goodman reports in the United States Gambling Study that
there are 9.3 million adults and 1.3 million adolescents with
a gambling problem. These are often lower-income residents, and
problem behaviors are worst among the poor and minorities.[50]
<p>
Gambling has caused increased family breakup, suicide, crime,
and massive personal debt. Jason Berg, a 19-year-old from a small
Iowa town, committed suicide after running up gambling debts.
He left a note: &quot;I'm out of control.&quot; Howard Russell,
a 41-year-old salesman, shot himself outside an Illinois casino
after losing more than $50,000.[51] <I>The Kansas City Star</I> reported
the tragic story of a mother who killed herself because she gambled
away the family savings at a casino riverboat.[52]
<p>
The social costs from pathological gambling are high. Peter Reuter,
executive director of the Maryland Task Force on Casino Gambling,
states, there is &quot;no convincing estimate of the average social
costs of an individual becoming a pathological gambler,&quot;
but the &quot;annual costs of $100 million or more in Maryland&quot;
is reasonable.[53]
<p>
Professor Kindt told the House Committee on the Judiciary on September
29, 1995, that the &quot;average socio-economic cost per compulsive
gambler per year has been calculated at $53,000.&quot;[54]
<p>
<center><h3>THE GAMBLER</h3></center>
<p>
Where do gamblers come from? Many gaming supporters count on diverting
funds from other states. They were surprised when a survey by
the Wisconsin Policy Institute of automobile license tags and
the patrons at a Wisconsin-based Indian tribe casino revealed
that nearly 80 percent were local people.[55]
<p>
Paul Dworn, the former editor of a leading gambling trade journal,
argued that most people go to casinos to be entertained: &quot;They
do not go because they have or want to win money.&quot;[56] But gaming
is not like going to Disneyworld or a ball game. It attracts people
who often can't afford the consequences, and it has proven to
be addictive.
<p>
The Wisconsin Policy Institute found that the typical casino gambler
is between 50 and 70 years old and has either retired or has a
blue-collar job. He or she wagers about $101 and loses about half
that amount during each visit.[57]
<p>
A 1995 survey done for the Iowa Department of Human Services found
that the availability of legalized gambling leads to increases
in the prevalence of gambling-related difficulties. Problem gamblers
are increasingly likely to be male, under the age of 30, non-Caucasian
and unmarried. The survey found that 3.5 percent are lifetime
problem gamblers and 1.9 percent are lifetime probable pathological
gamblers.[58]
<p>
Recent studies found lifetime gambling participation rates range
from a low of 74 percent to a high of 92 percent.[59] Iowa's survey
found that respondents spent an average of $40 per month gambling.
Men spend twice as much on gambling as women. People under age
30 spend twice what older gamblers spend. Singles spend more on
gambling ($51 per month) than marrieds ($31 per month).[60]
<p>
The economic strain on gamblers is often crippling. Kansas City's
Family Policy Council found that lower-income households spend
five to 10 times as much per capita on lottery tickets as do middle-income
homes. Since casinos came to Missouri, there has been a dramatic
increase in the number of pawn shops. Today, Kansas City has 38
shops, compared to four in 1979. Twelve shops opened within 18
months of the establishment of riverboat gambling.[61]
<p>
A Kansas City pawn shop owner said, &quot;You see people come
in here who can't afford to buy groceries, but they pawn their
VCR and go to the boat, where they lose $500.&quot; St. Louis'
Gamblers Anonymous reports that gamblers get money from their
life insurance and more than a third actually cancel their policies.
Nearly $1.3 billion of insurance fraud is committed each year
by pathological gamblers.[62]
<p>
The legalization of gambling and the number of pathological gamblers
appear to be linked, and some researchers believe gambling is
the fastest-growing addiction among teenagers. Henry Lesieur, Chair of 
the Criminal Justice Department at Illinois State University, headed a 1991 
panel that studied gambling among college students. The panel surveyed six 
schools in five states and concluded that almost one-quarter of students 
gamble at least once a week.[63]
<p>
Arnie Wexler, executive director of the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey, estimates that the number of problem gamblers
will grow as the industry expands. He graphically portrays gambling's
temptation for some. &quot;If you put a guy who wouldn't cheat
on his wife in a room with a gorgeous nude woman, some guys would
fall by the wayside.&quot;[64] While this scenario would not excuse
a man from cheating, Wexler argues that, in the same way, state
approved gambling encourages many people to bet and a certain
percentage will become pathological.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING REGULATION</h3></center>
<p>
Today, there are six major sectors of legal gambling: lotteries,
casino-style gambling, pari-mutuel racing, non-profits (including
bingo and Las Vegas nights), Indian high-stakes bingo and mini-casinos.
Regulating this rapidly expanding industry is expensive and complicated.
<p>
The state of Florida estimated it would cost nearly $50 million
to regulate 34 casinos, and that figure isn't unrealistic.[65] After
all, the 1991 annual budget for New Jersey's Casino Control Commission
was nearly $26 million, and that state's casinos are concentrated
in one city, not spread across a large state.[66]
<p>
But gaming regulation costs don't stop there. The New Jersey Division
of Gaming Enforcement spends another $36 million annually, a portion
of which provides police personnel for patrol and investigative
functions.[67]
<p>
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 created a federal commission
to set gaming rules and oversee regulation of Indian bingo games.
The federal regulation effort is scanty, however. There are less
than 30 staff persons to regulate hundreds of Indian casinos across
the nation.[68]
<p>
Bob Renneisen, president and CEO, Claridge's Casino, Atlantic
City said, &quot;Our goal is not to get more out of a customer
in three hours but to get him to stay for four hours.&quot;[69] He
figures that the gambler will lose more with time since all casino
games give the house a mathematical edge.
<p>
The industry has studied gambling psychology. The casinos don't
want the gambler to realize he is losing. Jack Binion, owner of
Horseshoe Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;What is gambling? It's
really just a hype on emotion.&quot; Bill Zneder, operations chief,
Aladdin Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;If you give a guy a $100
bill he looks at it like a round of golf, a golf cart, two beers
and a hot dog. But if you give him chips, it's just betting units
and it loses its value.&quot;[70]
<p>
<center><h3>ADVERTISING GAMBLING</h3></center>
<p>
As governments have become more dependent on gambling, their regulation
efforts have shifted somewhat to promotion. According to gambling
expert Robert Goodman, legislators are tending to legalize-higher-revenue
producing games just as the market is becoming saturated.[71] This
is why public subsidies have been used to help competing private
gambling operations survive.
<p>
Since 1934, the federal government has had a long-standing policy
of prohibiting gambling-related advertising. Current federal criminal
law generally prohibits anyone from broadcasting &quot;[a]ny advertisement
of or information concerning any lottery, gift enterprise, or
similar scheme, [or] offering prizes dependent in whole or in
part upon lot or chance.&quot;[72]
<p>
The law does permit not-for-profit organizations to advertise
if the activity is &quot;clearly occasional and ancillary to the
primary business of that organization.&quot; But that might soon
change.
<p>
Pro-gambling forces in the Senate tried to amend the Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 to &quot;allow commercial
gambling enterprises to advertise on radio and television, thereby
reversing a long-standing federal policy against commercial gambling
advertising.&quot;[73]
<p>
State governments already spend more than $300 million a year
in lottery advertisements.[74] Taxpayer funded pro-gambling ads mixed
with industry-paid ads could fill the airways with messages that
promote gambling, thus drawing in more gullible victims.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
Despite its popularity, legalized gambling is taking the country
in the wrong direction. Gambling is not an economic savior but
a disease that claims millions of victims.
<p>
President Clinton supports Congressman Wolf's proposal. In a letter
to Senator Simon, Clinton said, &quot;Too often, public officials
view gambling as a quick and easy way to raise revenues, without
focusing on gambling's hidden social, economic and political costs.&quot;
<p>
A national gambling commission could examine and publicize the
devastating consequences of legalized gambling. After the commission,
public policymakers should consider legislation to re-criminalize
or severely limit all forms of gambling.
