						The Centralization of Power and Governmental Unaccountability

					</h1>

<center>by Malcolm Wallop</center>
<p>
I have a feeling that the United States government is more corrupt today than at any other 
time in its history. I am not saying that there are more people on the take, that there are more 
bribes. I am not talking about Whitewater or comparable incidents. I am talking about a 
government corrupted by power. I am saying that the government has no sense of accountability 
or responsibility, and that the government of the United States actually views us, not as its 
citizens, but as its subjects. It has completely lost complete sight of the premise that the federal 
government derives its power from the states and from the people, and not the reverse.
I have found few days to be as enraging as those during which the Senate debated the 
Mitchell Health Care Plan. I read in the text of the plan that the states were allowed to levy taxes 
on the health care premiums of their citizens so that the states could pay for the new obligations 
that the federal government was imposing on them. The fact that we were permitted to do this, 
and that no one seemed to think that this was anything unusual, tells you how far we have gone 
down the road to statism.  Both parties, each for slightly different reasons, shoulder significant 
levels of guilt in this matter.
<P>
The federal government expresses its newfound dominion in a variety of ways. It exerts 
pressure through its courts, through the executive branch and through Congress. The federal gov-
ernment is now forcing the states to struggle with the imposition of unfunded mandates, a 
powerful concept under which the federal government tells the states what they must do and 
directs them to do it in the absence of federal funding.
<P>
	Congress long ago began to sense the rising tide of anti-tax sentiment and it just slipped 
the bond, ordered the States to raise taxes, and got out of it quite well. Congress also withholds 
funds in order to coerce the states' behavior. Look at what is happening in Virginia. While the 
EPA turns down plan after plan, the federal government threatens to withhold highway funds.  
The government also withheld funds from Wyoming for a long time because we did not raise the 
age of drinking for teenagers.
<P>
Some of the problems that we are now having are directly related to the Tenth Amendment. 
The federal government is a temptress. It holds out the promise of things to the states, but its 
promises are conditional. The Goals 2000: Educate America Act is one instance where this 
happened. The Crime Bill is another example. The idea is that if states conform their penal code 
to a concept developed in Washington, then money will be available for them to build prisons 
and hire police. The only problem is that to get the money, states have to cede authority back to 
the federal government.
<P>
The State is endlessly thumbing its nose at property rights. It is only now becoming a 
political liability to ignore them. Friedreich A. von Hayek, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, 
said that property is the key to guaranteeing freedom. According to von Hayek, any state which 
controls the power of property and production controls everything, and under these conditions, 
there can be no liberty or democracy.
<P>
	In 1993, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt gave an interview to Rolling Stone 
Magazine. The interviewer asked Babbitt about the concept of property rights. Babbitt replied 
that the old Anglo-Saxon idea of lines in the ground is no longer useful, that we have to develop 
a more communitarian sense of the rights of property. In response, the startled Rolling Stone 
interviewer commented that, in a more hysterical time, that notion would have been called 
communistic. My feeling is that you do not have to have lived in a hysterical time to have that 
reaction.
<P>
There are astonishing threats to free speech on the part of the federal government. Not the 
least of these threats is the recent Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) assault 
on a Berkeley group protesting the establishment of a housing project for the homeless in their 
neighborhood. The group was being investigated for violation the Fair Housing Act, simply for 
voicing their opinion that the housing plan had not been well thought out. Apparently, the 
government has decided that you may not object to administrative decisions under the Fair 
Housing Act.
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) told my community of Sheridan, Wyoming 
that it was in danger of putting the health and well-being of all of its citizens at risk if it contin-
ued to use its present water supply system. The EPA, pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, 
ordered Sheridan to install a new drinking water supply system. The community and the county 
worked with the EPA to develop a new reservoir and a new delivery plan and the plan was 
deemed acceptable by the administrators of the Act. There was debate in the community, as there 
always is within a community, over whether we ought to tax ourselves to implement the plan.  
On the day of the vote on the taxation issue, the EPA Region VIII Director issued a press release 
stating that if Sheridan did not vote to tax its elf, it would be fined an amount that would exceed 
our total assessed valuation within ten days of the imposition of the fine.  At that moment, we 
should have told the federal bureaucrats that they could be the mayor and county commissioner 
of Sheridan, that the county was theirs. But we did not tell them this and we voted to implement 
the plan.
<P>
Then, we were told by administrators of the Clean Water Act that we were going to flood 
some wetlands. The fact is that the wetland that we were flooding had been created by the 
original reservoir. Nonetheless, the EPA told us that we could not do it. Then the Corps of 
Engineers also said that we could not do it but then informed us that people would die and we 
would incur a large fine if we did not do it. So the community asked us, the congressional 
delegation, to get involved and see if there was a solution. In response, the Corps of Engineers 
and the EPA threatened the community for approaching their elected representatives. In my 
experience, threats of retaliation for appeals to elected representatives are not unique.
In short, the EPA said that we had not adequately assessed the alternative of condemnation. 
Keep in mind that this was a situation where a community's needs were more than fully satisfied 
by its existing water supply system, despite the fact that it had not quite satisfied all the ins and 
outs of the EPA. It seems very peculiar that under these circumstances the federal government 
would complain that the community failed to examine whether it had the authority to take water 
from some citizens of the community that is needed by other community residents.
<P>
	Every American is familiar with the Declaration of Independence's flowing statement, 
"We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed 
by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of 
Happiness - That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their 
just Powers from the Consent of the Governed. . . .”    Every school boy and school girl knows it. 
It is published and promoted all the time. I suspect, however, that far fewer people are familiar 
with the passage which directly follows it, the portion which states that "whenever any Form of 
Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish 
it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its 
Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."
This is not a call to tear up the Constitution and start over. I do not believe that the 
Constitution is the problem. I do submit that there is an increasingly contentious relationship 
between our government and its citizens or, as I perceive it, the government and its subjects. 
Where does this contentiousness come from? It comes from within the bowels of the unelected 
bureaucrats - not identifiable, not removable. No one knows how to get at a government that 
reacts in such ways.
<P>
The topic chosen for this conference brought to mind an article I wrote for Notre Dame Law 
School's Journal of Legislation entitled, "Tyranny in America: Would Alexis Recognize This 
Place Today?'' In his book, Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville assessed the prospect 
of despotism materializing in the United States. De Tocqueville asserted that, "the species of 
oppression by which democratic nations are menaced is unlike anything which ever before 
existed in the world. . . .” Contrary to mankind's previous experience with despotism, de 
Tocqueville predicted a new form.  De Tocqueville continued, "if despotism were to be 
established amongst the democratic nations of our day, it might assume a different character; it 
would be more extensive and more mild; it would degrade men without tormenting them. . . . I 
have no fear that they will meet with tyrants in their rulers, but rather with guardians."
<P>
	His warnings are pertinent to the topic of this conference because he describes self-
government as America's greatest virtue and its most sturdy impediment to tyranny. Self-govern-
ment was the bulwark which could ultimately protect the people of the United States from the 
advent of, what he termed, "administrative despotism". He felt the key to preventing ad-
ministrative despotism was maintaining and recognizing the fundamental differences between a 
centralized government and a centralized administration of that government. He elaborated on it 
by noting that the former exists in America, but the latter is nearly unknown there.
If the government, after having established the general principles of government, descended 
to the details of their application and if, having regulated the great interests of the country, it 
could descend to the circle of individual interests, freedom would soon be banished.  It is a very 
prophetic view of what we might do to ourselves as a nation with the democracy that we possess.
The original Articles of Confederation failed largely because the sovereign states retained 
total control over the powers of taxation, the raising of armies, and the regulation of commerce. 
As a result, the premise of the constitutional scheme devisethe delegates to the Constitutional 
Convention in 1787 was increased centralization of power and authority at the federal level. It 
was never their intent, however, that the administration of the central government was to be 
handled by or directed from the federal level. Far from it, Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist 
17 and 31, and James Madison in 46, repeatedly expressed their devout belief in, and the citizens' 
strong preference for government of a proximate nature.
<P>
	De Tocqueville's description mirrored this conception of American governance. He noted 
that, in the American republics, the secondary affairs of society had never been regulated by 
central authority and nothing to date has revealed its desire to interfere in them. The splendor of 
American society in those days was the almost invisible nature of government from the 
perspective of the average citizen.  Even when the federal government was empowered to act, it 
was largely incapable of forcing its will upon the citizens. If there was tremendous dissatisfaction 
with a directive of the federal government, state and local officials had sufficient stature and 
power to obviate what they believed to be illicit or malevolent actions. Also, the state and local 
officials were generally recognized as being closer, in terms of interest, to the people that were 
served, and thus in a better position to understand and respect the needs and desires of citizens. 
When the central government issued a decree, it had to entrust the execution of its will to its 
agents, over whom it frequently had no control. The townships, municipal bodies and counties 
form numerous concealed breakwaters which served to check or part the tides of popular 
determination. If an oppressive law were passed, liberty would still be protected by the method 
by which the law is executed.
<P>
With the modern advent of the unfunded mandate, of the overzealous bureaucrat, of coercive 
federal court orders and of the blackmail of States and localities though the attachment of strings 
to the granting of federal funds, the federal government circumvents all the protections that we 
thought were in place against administrative despotism. The statist view, and again I think that 
both parties are guilty of a major statist view, is that society has changed so dramatically that 
ordinary citizens cannot be trusted to make complex decisions themselves. Since citizens cannot 
be relied on to make enlightened and responsible decisions, the federal government has to 
determine the proper course for its citizens and ensure that its directives are enforced. This 
approach fundamentally asserts that self-government is ideal if it is simple and convenient, but 
not worth pursuing if it proves challenging or difficult. The principle of allowing citizens to 
make those choices for themselves which most directly affect them should be considered 
inviolable, irrespective of changing political climates, but it has not been considered inviolable.
<P>
	According to de Tocqueville, self-government is not only ideal but necessary since, even 
if the citizens of a nation are ignorant, apathetic, and selfish, any attempt by government to make 
the important or difficult decisions for them would only further aggravate these tendencies, not 
improve them. The reason is simple: it is precisely the exercise of self-government which makes 
citizens more attentive, more active.
<P>
A marvelous example of the enervating effects of democratic participation occurred 
following an incident in Kentucky in which a man in a pick-up truck drove up the exit ramp of an 
interstate highway. He was drunk. He crashed into a busload of children, burning them all - it 
was a terrible, terrible thing. The county in which it took place began to think that it was alcohol, 
not this individual, who was to blame. A referendum was put on the ballot forbidding all alcohol, 
in any form, for sale or consumption anywhere within the county.  In a county averaging forty 
percent participation in the electoral process, eighty-eight percent turned out to turn down that 
initiative. So, when affected, people do participate.
<P>
What has happened, though, with the advent of the Civil War, the Supreme Court's ever 
expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, the New Deal, the Warren Court's Activism, 
and the Great Society is that the locus of power has shifted decidedly to the central government. 
The citizens of America are beginning to be fed up with this and have declared this shift in power 
to be a failure. One of the most fascinating parts of this rejection by the American people is what 
is happening in the area of postal services.  With Federal Express, United Parcel Service, faxes 
and other things, we are now bypassing a government function that is largely viewed as 
inefficient.
<P>
In the area of security, the American people have basically declared that the police and the 
courts have not protected the country. There are neighborhood watches. There are external 
security systems around housing complexes. There are even some cities barring access to the city 
from the surrounding areas with gates and other methods of protection. In New York City, there 
are the Guardian Angels, and in most communities there are shopping malls.
<P>
	Every one always says, what do you mean malls? How are malls relevant to this 
discussion? My answer is that malls are what cities used to be. Go to a mall on a Saturday night 
and you see families walking safely with each other. You see young couples. You see people 
shopping. You see them standing in line for theaters. You see them at cafes enjoying themselves, 
feeling perfectly secure. Why? Because malls are private property and private security 
arrangements keep vagrants and other people out of them. In contrast, cities are not allowed to 
keep these people off the street.
<P>
In the area of education, there is a large move now toward privatization. States are beginning 
to experiment with all kinds of vouchers and other sorts of things. Families, not rich families but 
poor families, are trying to escape an educational system that is failing them and that is keeping 
them where they are. All around America you see people beginning to take action.
If we are going to change, it seems to me that several things have to take place. It is critical 
that the size and scope of government, both in manpower and resources, be severely limited. 
When people are talking about reducing taxes, it is the only means by which to reduce 
government. The government that is so big that it does not have to concern itself is too big to be 
a free government and it is becoming less free. Some of us believe that there ought to be an 
experimental assault on article III, section 2, pruning the right of the court to make certain 
decisions  
<P>
I honestly believe that we are at a sort of watershed time now, and I believe that watershed 
can actually work to our direct benefit if we recognize what must happen. Government cannot 
prescribe morals, but it can get out of the way. It can allow the can allow speech. I believe there 
are five legislative points and five points for any presidency that are important. Whatever they 
propose ought to be judged according to this five principles: 1) whether it restricts the growth of 
government; 2) whether it expands personal liberty; 3) whether it will it create economic growth; 
4) whether it will foster America's traditional value; and 5) whether it will ensure American 
security.
<P>
There is a last quote that I need to read you, also from the Declaration of Independence:
<blockquote>
<i>Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for 
light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are 
more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the 
Forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, 
pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute 
Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide 
new Guards for their future Security.</i>
</blockquote>
<P>
I believe that we are teetering on that time, and I believe that the powers of courts will be pruned 
if courts do not prune their powers themselves. I believe that people will begin to take back some 
of the powers that the States have lost under the Tenth Amendment.  I believe that you will find 
all kinds of resistance, as you are now finding from Virginia, from Wyoming, from Arizona, 
from Nevada, from other states, and from California, with their challenge to the federal 
government on the issue of immigrants.  You are beginning to see to movements to right 
ourselves. Organizations such as this one will serve as the intellectual basis from which these 
changes are derived.
<P>
<br>
<b>At this point, Senator Wallop took questions from the audience:  </b>
<P>
QUESTION: My question has to do with the premise of restriction.
<P>
SENATOR WALLOP: I do not pretend or propose to relegate all this power to the state 
legislatures, but I believe we have to demand a certain level of prudence. The states do have 
power, and the powers that were reserved to the states were not reserved to the federal 
government. Yet now these powers have been virtually universally usurped.  
<P>	
I do not believe that, for example, one welfare law crafted in Washington has any chance of 
being useful throughout America. We have seen that it does not work because, having spent well 
over a trillion dollars, poverty has increased in the United States since the Great Society 
programs were imposed.  
<P>
	One of the things that I believe in is welfare benefits being delivered within the states. The 
states and local communities certainly have an idea who is a gold digger and who has a genuine 
need, but a formula created in Washington and laid as a blanket across this country cannot 
possibly work, and it has not worked. That is why states are asking for and struggling to get 
waivers from the federal mandate.
<P>
So I believe that, yes, there are things that cross our borders as states, but there are far many 
more things that do not cross our borders, or ought not to, by way of a formula which the federal 
government has imposed. So prudence would be the standard by which we would make some of 
these decisions. There is a lot of room for prudence in what we see happening now as a result of 
the broad reach of the federal government.
<P>
QUESTION: Senator Wallop, it is clear that the Supreme Court has essentially interpreted the 
Tenth Amendment outside the context of the Constitution and it is going to be very difficult to 
get it back in because there is so much precedent. What wouldthink of the idea, which would 
eventually have to be a constitutional amendment, of creating a body to mediate the Tenth 
Amendment issues? A body, something like a conference of states, where the governor and the 
legislature would send a delegate. If a State thought its sovereignty has been infringed by the 
federal government, it could pass a resolution in the legislature saying so. Then Congress would 
then get a chance to reconsider their actions.  If Congress disagreed with the state, then a 
conference of states could adjudicate the matter. Essentially, the conference would get the 
Supreme Court's power to overturn certain kinds of federal legislation, maybe by a two-thirds 
vote. It would not be the case that anything could easily be overturned, but it would return the 
structure - the intended structure - in which the sovereign states would actually have some power 
to protect and take back the powers that they had lost.
<P>
SENATOR WALLOP: It sounds lawyerly to a layman, but I do not minimize the effort to restore 
Tenth Amendment rights. These efforts have tried and failed, but climates of opinion change and 
courts are clearly not immune to climates of opinion. If you have watched the history of 
decisions, they wander in one direction for periods of decades and then suddenly, to some eyes, 
they are enlightened and returned. To other eyes, they are not. There are always arguments about 
Supreme Court decisions. I do not know why anybody ever thought that five to four vote of the 
Court was a significantly stronger concept of American freedom than sixty votes in the Senate of 
the United States.
<P>
What really is necessary here is what is beginning to take place. That is the political 
realization that we have gone a bridge too far. Some of us have the feeling that we are counseling 
Russia to do the kinds of things and set up the kinds of systems that we viewed as our original 
premise and that somewhere in the night we are going to pass. We are going to wake up and find 
that they are the free country and that we are bound by the laws that we have allowed the federal 
government to impose on us.

California enjoys a record drop in crime</h2>

	Crime in California is dropping -- fast. So far, this decade looks to be the most promising for reducing crime since the state started keeping complete statistics in 1952. Although California suffered -- along with the rest of the nation -- while the crime rate nearly quadrupled between 1960 and 1980, California is now recording some of the largest crime reductions of any state.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Preliminary crime statistics for 1995 show that the overall crime rate in California fell 8.5 percent; violent crimes dropped 5.5 percent and property crimes fell 10.1 percent. If the trend holds, California will record a third straight year of falling crime in 1996, including a marked acceleration in the last two years. 
The hard evidence points to historic decreases in all categories of crime in the state. California is about to set state records for:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>  The largest one-year drop in state history in the rate <i>and</i> number of crimes;	<li>  The largest two-year decline in the number of crimes;	<li>  The first two-year drop in all major categories of crime (homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and motor vehicle theft);	<li>  The largest one-year drop in the number of violent crimes;	<li>  The largest one-year drop in the rate and number of property crimes;	<li>  The largest one-year drop in the number of burglaries;	<li>  The largest one-year drop in the number of motor-vehicle thefts.
</ul>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What accounts for these astonishing numbers? I would suggest it is in large part due to California's passage of a "three strikes and you're out" law, which has done more to stop revolving-door justice than any other measure in state or federal law. Enacted in 1994 by both popular initiative and legislative action, the law requires a defendant convicted of a felony to serve an indeterminate life sentence when it is proved that he has committed two or more previous felonies defined as "violent" or "serious." Offenders given a life sentence become eligible for parole only after serving 25 years or three times the term that the current conviction would ordinarily warrant, whichever is greater. A "two strikes" provision, part of the same law, requires that when a defendant is convicted of a felony, and has been previously convicted of one "serious or violent" felony, the term of imprisonment is twice the usual sentence provided for the second felony conviction.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In June 1996, the California Supreme Court held in <i>People v. Romero</i> that, notwithstanding the ostensible mandatory language of the "three strikes" law, judges retain the discretion to strike or dismiss prior felony convictions; the court's judgement relied on statutory interpretation and the separation of powers. Thus, the state of the law is that while judges have discretion to strike a prior conviction, our district attorneys will still prove prior felony convictions and state courts will still sentence offenders under "three strikes." I have sponsored legislation to narrowly define and restrict the discretion that judges will have in these cases.<p><b>Accountability for Criminal Choices</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As written and applied, "three strikes" is a model of strict and even-handed justice. It demands accountability, reflects common sense, presents a clear and certain penalty, and uncompromisingly invests in public safety. I like to reflect on former Chief Justice Warren Burger's comments made before an American Bar Association meeting in 1981: "A far greater factor is the deterrent effect of swift and certain consequences: swift arrest, prompt trial, certain penalty and -- at some point -- finality of judgment." Can anybody believe otherwise? The quotation reflects the chief justice's fundamental understanding that the rule of law affords the complementary blessings of both freedom and responsibility and provides the governing framework in which individual citizens make their individual decisions. The rule of law protects our free will from arbitrary constraints; at the same time, it provides consistency and impartiality to the life of the state and its citizens. What seems obvious in this formula is that as individuals exercise their individual, personal liberties in living their lives and in interacting with others, they also become personally accountable for the choices they make -- choices from which clear consequences arise. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Yet, many opponents of "three strikes" disagree with the notion of strict personal accountability. Of course, while most of the self-proclaimed experts in criminal justice state their objections on other grounds -- they call "three strikes" draconian, ineffective, too broad, too tough, and too expensive - the  real theme that resounds in their criticism is that "three strikes" "re-victimizes" persons who already have been "victimized" by the forces of an unfriendly society and an adversarial government. In short, their view is that the targets of "three strikes" are not accountable for their conduct because "complex" forces extrinsic to the individual are the principal causes of criminal activity: poor education, unemployment, a detrimental social situation, or even the law enforcement system. Further, these critics have employed this philosophy to demand that sentencing for convicted criminals be made in light of "mitigating circumstances" and that incarceration should be for "rehabilitative purposes" to redress what society "did" to the inmate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The voters of California have rejected this nonsense. And the record shows "three strikes" is doing precisely what the voters demanded when they overwhelmingly passed the initiative, by 72 percent to 28. The career criminal with multiple serious or violent felony convictions is being forced to make what should be an easy decision: Either stop committing felonies and live the remainder of your life in freedom, or spend 25 years to life in prison the next time you are caught and convicted of a felony. The career criminal will be held <i>personally accountable</i> for his decisions. Imagine that! When the voters rejected revolving-door justice, they rejected the arguments of apologists that we can divorce negative personal conduct from individual accountability. <p><b>Proportional Punishment</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The second criticism against "three strikes" by criminal apologists is that the law does not furnish proportionate punishment. These critics focus on the cases in which a habitual felon is charged with a "minor" property or drug offense that qualifies as a third strike. They allege it is wholly improper to impose an indeterminate life sentence for a "minor" crime and that instead the offender should be given special consideration or more lenient treatment. The philosophical approach advocated here is that criminal conduct should be viewed in isolation of past history and surrounding circumstances. If a habitual felon currently commits a crime that is classified as a felony under California law, and he has convictions for two previous "serious" felonies, is it any surprise that Californians want a tougher punishment for the current felony?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's examine what constitutes a "serious or violent felony" for a "three strikes" prior conviction: murder or voluntary manslaughter; mayhem; rape; sodomy by force, violence, duress, menace, threat of great bodily injury, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person; oral copulation by force, violence, duress, et cetera; lewd or lascivious acts on children; felonies with personal use of firearm; attempted murder; assault with intent to commit rape or robbery; assault with deadly weapon; arson; kidnapping; selling drugs to minors; and many others. If these are not "serious" enough, I would like to know which ones should be dropped as insufficiently serious. When the third strike is but a "minor" felony, such as grand theft or possession of certain drugs for sale, why should society ignore the habitual criminal activity of this offender when sentencing him? <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Common sense dictates the answer to this question. First, society does not view crime in a vacuum. As Princeton professor John DiIulio recently wrote, "Most Americans rightly think in terms of total criminality -- the full social and moral weight of an offender's acts against life, liberty, and property. They reject the criminological equivalent of grade inflation -- judging plea-bargained-gorged prisoners by their last conviction rather than their overall criminal grade-point average, adult and juvenile." Second, an offender who has committed a series of violent or serious crimes is likely to commit additional crimes of the same nature; wisdom demands that an offender's criminal record be the starting point for determining punishment. Finally, the rule of law demands a response to a lifestyle of destruction and violence. There is nothing disproportionate about giving a harsh sentence to a felon who has not learned from having committed two serious felonies before. <p><b>Deterrence Effect</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There has been a marked split of opinion, at least in academia, as to how best to prevent crime. On the one hand, some argue that habitual criminal activity can be "cured" by placing offenders in correctional programs that renounce retributive goals and instead stress the redemptive value of education, vocational instruction, and even group therapy. Another school of thought centers on the positive behavioral effects of a system of clear and certain consequences for destructive and criminal behavior. Unfortunately, many in the "redemptive programs" group reject outright the legitimacy of deterrence. The causes of criminal behavior are far too complex, they say, to permit any generalizations about whether individuals will consider legal prohibitions or sanctions when they act and interact in society -- especially when they are hungry, ill-housed, under-educated, or emotionally neglected. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The value of deterrence, however, is grossly underestimated by these "experts," who have devised no way to prove or disprove its effects. I believe certainty of incarceration, for a long and inevitable period, nonetheless has a dramatic effect on the behavior of individuals. Consider the statement of a veteran homicide detective in the Sacramento police department as to the law's impact: "You hear [the criminals] talking about it all the time. These guys are really squirming. They know what's going on. . . . I've flipped 100 percent," Gregory Gaines told a <i>Sacramento Bee</i> reporter. Gaines had just been released from Folsom State Prison with two serious or violent felony convictions -- two "strikes" -- and told the reporter that many other inmates have decided to heed the warnings of the "three strikes" law. "It's a brand-new me, mainly because of the law. It's going to keep me working, keep my attitude adjusted."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps the most interesting statistics track the migratory patterns of felons on parole in California. In the last year before "three strikes" became law in 1994, 226 more paroled felons chose to move to California than moved out. After "three strikes" took effect, the flow reversed: 1,335 more paroled felons chose to leave California in 1995 than to enter. We've gone from being a net importer of paroled felons to a net exporter! Coincidence? Hardly. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another school of thought seeks to explain the reduction in crime in California solely as a function of social or demographic trends. They argue that a troubled economy breeds more crime. (This ignores that in 1992, 1993, and 1994, overall crime in California dropped even as the state's economy endured one of the worst economic recessions in its history.) They argue that the crime rate falls naturally when the proportion of males in the crime-prone age groups declines. (While this may be part of the explanation, no study we have found supports the notion that "demographic changes" alone drive the crime rate up or down.) Without admitting it, this side in the debate, like some of those in the "redemptive programs" community, believes that tough incarcerative penalties for criminals and tough law-enforcement strategies do not work. In short, they deny the obvious value of deterring crime as a means of preventing it. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider the historical experience of no deterrence. California has about 138,000 inmates in its prisons today. When we began our push for a tougher response to crime in the early 1980s -- establishing punishment and social incapacitation as the priorities of our penal system -- the total inmate population was only 25,000, even though the crime rate reached an all-time high in 1980-81. Our prisons had revolving doors through which career criminals cycled, <i>undeterred by the prospect of a short prison stint</i>. Many California inmates viewed a stay in prison as a chance to receive neglected medical and dental care, and to beef up their muscles in the weight yard in preparation for the next "recess" on the outside. "Three strikes" and other tougher laws have begun to change that.<p>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under the leadership of governors Deukmejian and Wilson and the state's vocal (and often overlooked) victims of crime, California embarked on an active prison building program in conjunction with tougher crime laws and more conservative judges. So where are we now? Today we have 138,000 felons incarcerated in state prisons. Unless you believe that releasing those additional 113,000 felons from our prisons tomorrow would have no effect on the number of crimes committed and that our laws, policies, and promise of punishments have no effect on the number of criminals on our streets and the amount of crime suffered by our state, it is clear that we are beginning to win the fight.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But what if we had not changed our incarceration policies so dramatically? What level of crime might California be suffering from today if the runaway trend of upward crime rates of the 1960s and 1970s had continued unabated? In 1994, California's overall crime rate was 3,147 crimes per 100,000 people. The rate would have reached 4,403 per 100,000 had the trend of the 1970s continued. In just the last two years -- the "three strikes" years -- we can estimate the level of crime victimization that would have occurred had our pre-"three strikes" crime rate remained unchanged. In the last two years, California would have had 907 additional murders, 2,015 additional rapes, 37,256 additional robberies, 11,602 additional aggravated assaults, 92,727 additional burglaries, and 56,991 additional motor vehicle thefts. A recent RAND Corp. study estimated that rigorous enforcement of "three strikes" will reduce serious felonies committed by adults in California between 22 and 34 percent below what would have occurred had the previous law remained in effect. The authors emphasized that about a third of the felonies eliminated will be violent crimes such as murder, rape, and assaults causing great bodily injury. The other two-thirds will be less violent, but still serious, felonies, including less-injurious assaults, most robberies, and burglaries. 
<p><b>Cost to Society</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The critics of "three strikes" also miss another obvious truth: A criminal in prison cannot commit crimes against the general public. In fact, the cost of crimes committed against our citizens is higher than the cost of incarcerating them. The critics are warning that "three strikes" --  and all our tougher laws -- will cost too much to implement. Yet, according to a 1992 U.S. Department of Justice report on justice expenditures and employment, only three cents of every tax dollar goes to public safety such as police, courts, prisons, jails, and related activities. Perhaps we should question why our priorities have been so backwards. I submit that, strictly analyzed in a cost-benefit perspective, the tough approach to crime is financially sound. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A 1996 recent study by the National Institute for Justice assessed the costs to society of murders, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, and burglaries. The costs included both tangible and intangible costs to the victims, their families, and society, from lost income and medical expenses to pain and suffering and risk of death. The federal study's calculations did not include direct costs to the criminal-justice system, such as police, jail, prosecution, courts, prisons, and the like. The costs to society and victims for each crime range from $2,940,000 for each murder to $1,400 for each burglary. Using these base figures, had California not experienced the post-"three strikes" drop in crime in 1994 and 1995, it would have cost us:
<p><ul>	<li>  $2.66 billion for the additional murders;	<li>  $174.3 million for the additional rapes;	<li>  $707.9 million for the additional robberies;	<li>  $108.5 million for the additional aggravated assaults;	<li>   $129.9 million for the additional burglaries.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Clearly, the costs to society of a return to the lenient approach, even in purely fiscal terms (which is obviously not the primary consideration when paired with the human costs of crime) are astronomical. Other approaches to preventing crime have value that I, for one, do not dispute. The move toward community-oriented policing must continue and thrive. California leads the nation in community-oriented policing, a philosophy that enables police officers to work more intensively with citizens in their neighborhoods, rather than scurrying from one 911 call to the next. It, too, costs money, but the investment is worth the up-front costs.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, some critics of "three strikes" argue that the example of New York City, which has enjoyed a steep drop in crime without the benefit of state laws similar to California's, undercuts the case for "three strikes" policies. New York City, however, invested in a comprehensive community-oriented policing program along with a "zero tolerance" policy that requires officers to strictly enforce every possible violation. Like "three strikes," New York City's program costs money -- and it works. (New York City has added 7,000 officers since 1990. The entire Los Angeles Police Department totals 8,737; New York City 37,800.) Ironically, it is deterrence again at work in New York City -- the criminals in the city know the police are there and change their behavior accordingly.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, we are told that a proportionally large group of young males, currently in their pre-teen years, will soon move into their "crime-prone" years. We should refuse to accept the notion that a high rate of crime will be committed by these youths. A juvenile crime wave is not inevitable, just as our high crime rates of the past were not inevitable. As a society we have to confront the conditions that exacerbate levels of juvenile crime and violence. Our challenge is to implement juvenile crime laws and policies which will deter as many as possible from a life of crime while still incarcerating those teenagers who commit serious violence on our citizens. There is an important place for prevention and intervention programs for our young. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although "three strikes" will incarcerate more habitual criminals, the costs are justified. The price of allowing these offenders to return to a lifestyle of victimizing citizens is too high. "Three strikes" incapacitates active criminals, who can no longer commit crimes against the public. "Three strikes" removes from our streets the harmful role models these offenders present to our youth and to gang "wannabes." "Three strikes" re-introduces into our collective consciousness a moral imperative that criminal activity should not be tolerated in any way. Most importantly, "three strikes" reduces crime by providing a solid and unquestionable deterrent to criminal behavior. California's sharp decline in crime in the last two years may be attributable to numerous, complex factors, but it is indisputable that "three strikes" has played a major role in reshaping public safety in California, both for law-abiding citizens and for would-be criminals. <p><i><b>Dan Lungren</b>, a Republican, is the attorney general of California.</i>

<P>
        THE CATO INSTITUTE<br>
		APRIL 28, 1994<br>					     
		By Senator Malcolm Wallop
<P>
As you may have noticed, last Friday was Earth Day.  Rallies, teach-ins, exhibitions were held in schools, churches and civic spaces around the country to celebrate clean air and water as well as efforts to protect endangered species, vanishing rain forests, and national treasuers like the Grand Canyon.  Who could be so vile as to be against such things?  Nobody.  Are we then all environmentalists?  Well, that depends on your definition.  You see, much of what passes for environmentalism today really has nothing to do with clean air and water, the health of humans or other species, and the beauty of wide-open spaces.  It has everything to do with dirty politics and the acquisition of power-indeed with the hoariest of political scams; invoking supposedly scientific knowledge of the public good to legitimize transfering money and power to one's own friends and ideological compatriots.
<P>
Collectivists promised a better world if only we would empower government to nationalize or regulate companies, to take over the providential functions of families, to monopolize education and, almost every where in the world, to collectivize medical care.  During the past several decades, and after harsh experiences, the public throughout the civilized world realized that all these schemes were scams.  The principal beneficiaries were the people who ran them, while the general public paid, got ever-worsening services, and was obliged to learn to court bureaucrats.  So now from Santiago to Stockholm, from Mexico to Milan to Moscow, privatization is the order of the day.  Governments have sold more than $260 billion in state enterprises.  Nations are privatizing pension systems, voucherizing medical care and education, and deregulating companies.  People are privatizing even systems once deemed inherently governmental-police and fire protection, mail delivery, prison management, trash collection-as much to rid themselves of corruption and to regain control of their own lives as to improve the yield of the money they pay for services.
<P>
But corrupt collectivists have no shame.  The moment one of their pseudoscientific claims is exposed, they invent another, confident that the public will take the loftiness of their expressed goals as a warrant of their good faith and competence. And so people who a few  years ago described themselves as scientific socialists now describe themselves as environmental experts.  But if you look at what they prescribe in the name of environmentalism now, you find that it is no different from what they were prescribing not so long ago in the name of some other pseudoscience.  In the name of the environment they can do what they could not do in the name of Marx or Keynes.  They can restructure the U.S. auto industry, block construction here while authorizing it there, punish politically incorrect constituencies in tobacco land or lumber land.  Every landowner, everyone who eats, showers, works, will have to pay and bow to the new masters.
<P>
And to whom do environmentalist proposals channel power and money?  Why to the environmental establishment, of course.  Note that of the first $1 billion allegedly spent for toxic waste cleanup under Superfund, the biggest federal environmental program, more than half went to well connected law firms, including the infamous Rose law firm.  And I assure you that the so-called cleanup contracts, with fat shares for consultants, are not given out by lottery either.  If the spoils of federal public works projects are doled out on the basis of politics, why should we expect the spoils of environmental policy to be any different?
<P>
So what about the rest of us who don't want power and privilege at other people's expense, the ones who really care about clean air and water?  Well, we had better realize that to get these goods we must do more or less what we do to get other kinds of goods.  Real environmentalism is not about commandeering other people's resources, destroying jobs, or attacking industry.  It's not about expanding and centralizing government power.  Real environmentalism is about good stewardship.  And what most effectively promotes good stewardship are the incentives created by private property rights and competitive markets.  Real environmentalism seeks to empower people, not governments.  If people are allowed to own more of the planet, they will take better care of it.    
			<center>
					<H4>The Market Failure Paradigm</H4>
			</center>
The policies and rhetoric of phony environmentalism are based upon a specific theoretical rationale-<I>market failure. </I>  Just as they used to say that unregulated private activity would produce poverty, now they say that individuals freely pursuing their interests cause pollution, habitat destruction, and resource depletion.  That, they say, is because markets do not reflect the social or external costs of economic activity.  Therefore, they argue, only a politically controlled marketplace is compatible with environmental quality.  This &quot;market failure&quot; paradigm has an almost unlimited potential for mischief.  Practically every private transaction has <I>some</I> effect on external parties or resources.  Since any economic activity may have some environmental impact, this approach demands that virtually all economic decisions be politically managed. 
<P>
Let me assure you, the threat of pervasive regulation is not imaginary.  The Environmental Protection Agency alone requires local governments to implement some 419 &quot;essential&quot; regulations. 
<P>
Environmental rules have imposed &quot;water efficiency&quot; standards on our shower heads and toilets and environmental agencies tell companies how their employees must commute to work.  In the name of air quality, biodiversity, waste disposal, recycling, and wetlands, America is rapidly adopting a green variant of centralized planning.  
<P>
But the premise is as bad as the conclusion.  Environmental problems are not the consequence of free markets and private property; rather, they result from too little reliance on private property and markets.  Whether we consider elephants in Africa, salmon streams in England, or forests in the United States, privately owned resources have been better protected than their politically-managed counterparts.  Because environmental degradation is caused substantially by government interference, a policy of ecological privatization-the extension of private property rights to the broadest possible array of natural resources-is the proper agenda for real environmentalism.

				<H4>What Preserves?  What Destroys?</H4>
		</center>
Let's look at some examples of how markets and private ownership promote good stewardship.  
<P>
My first example is &quot;The Strange Story of the Disappearing Pigeons and the Flourishing Chickens!&quot;  When Columbus discovered America, there were billions of passenger pigeons, no chickens-now there are billions of chickens, no passenger pigeons.  
<P>
The reason is straightforward.  People concerned themselves with the welfare of stilt houses to shelter these vulnerable birds.  Farmers would stay up at night to protect them.  Researchers studied the tastes and nutritional needs of chickens, diseases were cured, and social pathologies (for example, the tendency of birds to peck one another to death) were resolved.  Private property linked chickens and mankind symbiotically.  
<P>
By contrast, passenger pigeons became extinct because they were the &quot;common heritage of all Americans.&quot;  Many people valued these birds but they had no way to translate their concern into effective action.  By law, wildlife is owned by &quot;the people&quot; collectively.  Private ownership of a pigeon was possible only if one first killed the bird.  Not surprisingly, pigeons were destroyed in huge numbers and the habitat for the bird shrank rapidly as America converted forests into lands suitable for chickens and other species that could be owned.  The point of this simple story?  Private ownership provides a critical linkage between man and nature, between economy and ecology.  Private property encourages human beings to consider the welfare of what they own; when you own it, if you destroy it you're the one who loses.  Common or public ownership provides far fewer and much weaker inducements to good stewardship; destroy an unowned property, and someone else bears the cost.
<P>
A limited experiment with privatization is working to save the African elephant, an animal imperiled by cows, ploughs and poaching.  Most media accounts blame the poaching on the international trade in ivory.  The solution thus seems obvious: Suppress the ivory trade!  Environmental groups endorsed this approach, now codified under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).  The ivory ban, they predicted, would reduce trade, lower prices and, thus, protect the elephant.  But the prediction, and the results, have gone awry.
<P>
Africans are poor.  If elephants do not contribute to their well being, Africans will convert elephant habitat to other land uses.  Without economic reasons for preserving the species, Africans are likely to view the elephant less as a noble animal than as a giant rat!  
<P>
The only way to ensure the survival of the African elephant is to let people own them.  As it happens, Zimbabwe has experimented with a limited form of privatization, and the results are encouraging.
<P>
Zimbabwe's government, recognizing that it could not effectively prevent poaching, created a mechanism whereby local tribal councils could petition to have elephants in their territory transferred from national to local control.  In effect, ownership rights were transferred to the local citizenry.  
<P>
The effects of this policy were significant.  Elephants provide over 10 million Zimbabwe dollars a year in income to about two dozen tribal villages.  Complaints that &quot;your&quot; elephants are causing problems quickly became pleas for advice on how best to protect &quot;our&quot; elephants.  Former poachers became game wardens, protecting the newly privatized species.  Individuals in the affected communities came to recognize that keeping an elephant alive today might well mean a better life for their families tomorrow.  Villagers guard against poachers, cull elephant herds to prevent overpopulation, and protect their investment in future ivory production and safari income.  As a result, the elephant population has grown from 30,000 to more than 70,000 over the past two decades.    
<P>
In contrast, in Kenya, where hunting and ivory sales are banned, poachers succeed in killing elephants because no one has an economic stake in protecting them.  The elephant population has plunged from 140,000 to 20,000 over the past two decades. 
<P>
If these examples are rejected because chickens, after all, are protected only to be killed and eaten, or because one believes privatization options are applicable only to species having direct commercial value-then consider cats, dogs, parakeets, tropical fish and other pets.  People protect these species not for monetary reasons or to grace the dining table, but rather because we enjoy and care for these animals.  Much the same can be said for privately-supported zoos and conservation centers that protect all sorts of endangered and threatened species-lemurs, butterflies, birds-not because of any profit margin, but because in the free-market, individuals have the ability to protect those things that they find valuable, for whatever reason they so choose. <P>
The pet example is an interesting one because it illustrates that ownership links man and nature in ways that extend beyond the strictly commercial sphere.  People care for specific animals and therefore are willing to devote time, energy and money to protecting them.  Ownership makes it possible for that effort not to be wasted.  I need not fear that my well fed and pampered parakeet will become my neighbor's Sunday lunch.  Moreover, although the relationship between pet and owner is a non-commercial one, a rich commercial sector-pet food companies, veterinary hospitals, pet care products, even pet grooming salons-has evolved to serve the owners and their pets. 
<P>
Green ideologues warn that thousands of species are disappearing each year, that the earth faces a biodiversity &quot;crisis.&quot;  As Julian Simon and the late Aaron Wildavsky have shown, the empirical data do not support such claims.  Nonetheless, it's worth pondering how we can possibly protect the 10 to 100 million species of plants and animals that are believed to exist today.  Current strategies would leave this task to governments.  Yet many of them are inept at protecting their human populations, never mind animals.  There are, however, more than 5.5 billion people in the world today.  If able to own some specific endangered species, many would do so.  If a few hundred or thousand people were overseeing each species, then the survival odds would greatly improve.  Moreover, since such species will often be protected in a fenced &quot;natural&quot; habitat, it's likely that other species will be protected as well.
<P>
The good news is, in spite of legal limitations on ownership of wildlife and habitat, grass-roots private conservation groups such as Ducks Unlimited, the National Wild Turkey Federation, and the North American Bluebird Society are achieving great results.  As a recent <I>Policy Review</I> article by Brian Jendryka reports, there are perhaps 1 to 2 billion more songbirds in the United States today than at the time of the Pilgrims.  The population of wild turkeys has increased from about 30,000 in the early 1900s to more than 4 million today.  Private citizens and organizations have built more than 100,000 bluebird houses in the past 15 years, helping to increase the Eastern bluebird population by 9.5 percent.
<P>
Private conservationists are protecting non-indigenous species as well, reports Ike Sugg of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.  David Bamberger, the former chairman of Church's Fried Chicken and now a game rancher, has single-handedly preserved 29 of the 31 remaining bloodlines of the Scimitar-horned Oryx, a rare antelope native to war-torn sub-Saharan Africa.  Bamberger is one of 450-plus ranchers in Texas who own an estimated 200,000 head of some 125 exotic species.  More than 19,000 of these animals belong to species that are imperiled in the wild.  Several are now more plentiful in Texas than in their lands of origin.</FONT>

<H4>Reassessing the Market Failure Paradigm</H4>
</center>
In contrast, government has been a leading cause of environmental problems.  As Richard Stroup and Jane Shaw note in a book called <I>Taking the Environment Seriously</I>, the U.S. Forest Service has promoted clear-cutting in ecological sensitive forests where it is difficult to grow trees.  The Bureau of Reclamation has built dams that innundated canyons and free-flowing streams.  Department of Agriculture subsidies have encouraged farmers to drain wetlands, overuse marginal crop land, and use excessive amounts of pesticides.  The Armed Forces and the Department of Energy have created hazardous waste dumps that will cost untold billions of dollars to clean up.
<P>
How come?  Bureaucrats are no more evil than the rest of us-or maybe not much.  But they work with huge sums of other people's money.  They have the legal power to jail people who try to stop them, and prosper to the extent that they manage big projects and give out big contracts.  Furthermore, they bear little if any of the costs of their actions.  With such incentives, it is no wonder that they have often acted in total disregard of environmental concerns.
<P>
The relevant test for us as citizens is not whether markets are perfect, but whether they perform better than political arrangements.  If the market failure explanation were correct, one would expect that less market-oriented societies would have fewer environmental problems.  The opposite is the case.  Our worst ecological nightmares are the daily realities of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where government had the kind of environmental control powers that our environmental movement craves.  Experience shows that market economies consistently outperform socialist economies on ecological grounds.
<P>
Centralized ecological planning is a species of what Nobel economist Friedrich Hayek called the &quot;fatal conceit.&quot;  Hayek observed that the knowledge necessary to manage a modern economy is dispersed-only the individual knows the specific circumstances he faces, and only the individual knows the full range of options he might exercise to improve the situation.  This information is too extensive, too ephemeral, too non-quantitative, and too intuitive to be centralized and made available to any single mind or set of minds.  Furthermore, only if the individual cares enough to make the best of the little piece of the puzzle in his hands, can society expect to benefit from the richness of this dispersed information.  Like markets, ecosystems are too complex, too varied, and too sensitive to changing circumstances to be managed by a central authority.  Good environmental stewardship, no less than good business management, depends upon the kind of dispersed knowledge that is available only to self-interested individuals.
<P>
Bureaucratic environmental policies are also highly vulnerable to corruption.  The details of environmental policy have major economic implications; thus, interest groups will seek favorable treatment at the expense of groups less well organized or less politically powerful.  What we learned in school about regulatory agencies, that they are often captured by the strongest of the special interests they regulate, also applies to environmental regulation.  In the mid-1980s, for example, a coalition of environmental groups and waste treatment companies successfully lobbied to expand the number of Superfund sites and mandate the use of the most expensive cleanup methods.  They even succeeded in blocking measures aimed at reducing the production of hazardous waste!  These days a coalition of agricultural interests has sought to impose a more expensive and more heavily polluting fuel-ethanol-on an unsuspecting public in the name of clean air!  There is no end to political greed, and the more extensive political controls get, the more opportunities for special-interest politics we create.
<P>
The regulators themselves have incentives to put their organizational interests ahead of the public interest.  A 1987 survey of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials found little correlation between the officials' judgments as to which areas merited most attention and what the agency actually did.  In part, these skewed priorities result from the political imperatives of the budget process.  To enlarge its share of federal resources, EPA has not been above sensationalizing environmental risks such as asbestos in our schools, radon in our homes, and pesticide residues on our food.  When environmental policy is political, it is bound to reflect fads, careerism, and greed rather than scientific realities.  
<P>
Not surprisingly, bureaucratic approaches aren't working.  The New York Times has reported how a refinery in Yorktown, Virginia was required to spend 31 million dollars to control benzene emissions.  The regulatory requirements focused on the refinery's waste water treatment plant, but the majority of benzene emissions were coming from another part of the facility that would have been far less expensive to clean up-about 25 million dollars less.  And how about the Endangered Species Act, a very controversial law these days and one of my personal favorites  Since 1966, 1,354 species have been listed as endangered or threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service.  Of these, only 19 species have been &quot;delisted&quot;-seven because they became extinct, eight because they were improperly listed in the first place.  Only four species have been delisted because they have actually recovered to the point where they are no longer threatened.  Yet according to the National Wilderness Institute, the American people spend over 3 million dollars per species on enforcing this ineffective law, and their are over 800 species on the list.  Not exactly a brilliant success.  And not so different from government performance regarding welfare and other matters. 	Then there is the problem of cost.  Business compliance expenses, paperwork burdens, and other direct costs of environmental regulation in the United States are now estimated at well over $150 billion a year, based on the calculations of the EPA-and I don't have to tell you about the EPA's reputation for less than accurate numbers.  Total costs, which include reduced levels of business formation and job creation, are significantly higher.  
<P>
Finally, the web of environmental regulations is restricting the freedom of our citizens and criminalizing what would otherwise be regarded as lawful behavior.  How does this item grab you?  In March of 1992, federal officials trespassed onto Richard Smith's ranch and seized the pickup trucks of Mr. Smith and his elderly father.  The Smiths were accused of poisoning endangered birds, even though the Fish and Wildlife Service was unable to present any evidence and formal charges were never filed.  Only nine months later were the trucks finally returned.
<P>
Some of you are no doubt familiar wiwth the story of John Pozgai, an immigrant from  Eastern Europe.  Pozgai purchased a 14-acre dump site across from his truck repair business in Morrisville, Pennsylvania.  He removed some 7,000 old tires and several rusting cars, and leveled the area with clean fill dirt.  His neighbors were pleased.  But in 1991, he was hauled into court by the EPA, charged with violating federal wetlands &quot;policy,&quot; sentenced to three years in prison, and slapped with a $200,000 fine (later commuted to $5,000).  His crime?  Using dirt without a permit.
<P>
Does that happen to everybody?  No.  We have all heard how the State of Arkansas gave special treatment to Tyson Foods because of their cozy relationship with the Governor.  If politics can provide protection to the propreitors of failed S&amp;Ls, it can give good cover to politically-powerful polluters.  It is the nature of politics, even when we try to use politics to protect nature; saying it is all for a good cause makes not a difference in the world.  Remember, the more expensive environmental regulation gets, the higher the economic stakes, the more incentive there will be to play by a special set of rules.
<P>
The current situation is unacceptable: we are spending vast sums, getting very little in return, stifling enteprise, surrendering our freedom to unelected bureaucrats, and encouraging corruption.  I hope you all will agree that there has got to be a better way.</FONT>

<h4>Solutions</h4>
</center>

Most environmental problems are not the fault of capitalism.  Rather, they stem from the <I>absence</I> of property rights and markets.  Since the air, the water, most species of mammals and fish and public lands have no private owners, they have few effective protectors and defenders.  Trees cannot have standing.  But behind many a tree, there could stand a private owner ready and able to defend his property.
<P>
Granted, privatizing trees and land animals usually presents no great technical difficulties, though some may find it politically controversial, so let's look at the hard cases.
<P>
In both England and America, the primary approach to protecting river quality is political.  A legislature sets water quality standards, and an environmental agency determines what effluent levels are compatible with those standards.  The agency then takes an inventory of emission sources along the river and decides what cleanup burdens each source will bear.  In the United States, the water quality standards and cleanup requirements imposed on municipalities have been more lenient than those placed on industry.  Moreover, enforcement has been less stringent.  The result is that today government polluters pose the main threat to river quality.
<P>
In England, much the same system prevails, but along some rivers, political controls are augmented by a system of private property defenses.  One such river, the Derby [pronounced Darby], illustrates the situation.  A fishing club, the Pride of Derby, held the rights to fish along a stretch of the river.  When the club found that water pollution was killing fish, it took action to defend its property rights.
<P>
As in the United States, the plaintiff looked upstream to determine which sources might contribute to the problem.  And as in the United States, both industrial and municipal sources were found.  The club approached both groups.  The industry reviewed the situation, recognized that it had indeed been &quot;trespassing,&quot; and negotiated a cleanup agreement.  
<P>
In contrast, the municipality argued that city governments faced more pressing responsibilities (public housing, unemployment relief, education, street and bridge maintenance) and should not be required to divert funds to any cleanup.  Besides, the city authorities argued, the cleanup would primarily benefit wealthy fishermen.  To spend money in this way was regressive and unfair. In effect, the municipality in England-like many in the UnitedStates-argued that not all polluters are equal; political polluters are entitled to special consideration.  
<P>
The Pride went to court, however, and prevailed.  The court held that the issue was not one of income distribution but rather one of trespass.  A municipality had no more right than anyone else to take another's property.  The case set a precedent which to this day puts potential polluters on notice that endangering river quality is not acceptable.  Note, also, that the Pride of Derby's success protected not only its stretch of the river but areas downstream as well.  What's more, it extended the umbrella of protection to species not highly valued by the fishermen.    
<P>
A property rights approach might also dramatically improve the way we manage and protect ground water.  Under current policies, users of groundwater have rights to the water they capture or consume, but not to water left in the ground.  Since users have no right to the water they conserve, their incentive is to overconsume.  This poses no great problem where groundwater is relatively abundant.  But when rising demand leads to groundwater depletion, the only recourse now available is to impose political controls on water usage. 
<P>
Fred Smith, a former EPA analyst who founded the Competitive Enterprise Institute ten years back, suggests we consider another approach.  He points out that a very different strategy has been successfully used to manage another valued underground liquid resource-oil.  In the United States and many other countries, underground rights in oil capture are assembled via &quot;unitization&quot; agreements into single pools that can be managed in an integrated fashion to ensure rational usage.  
<P>
This process is not simple; it involves difficult analytic procedures to determine the appropriate boundaries of the field, and requires costly legal maneuvering to reach agreement among the original owners.  Nonetheless, unitization has been widely applied and has done much to make possible the efficient use and conservation of petroleum.  Why not extend property rights to groundwater and see if unitization and private management agreements evolve?  
<P>
Now let's consider how property rights, markets, and emerging technologies may enable the private sector to play a greater role in protecting oceanic resources and airsheds.  One of the most cost-effective ways to protect ocean water quality and biodiversity would be to lift restrictions on offshore oil production.  I know this will strike the environmental establishment as outrageous heresy, but facts are facts.  Prohibiting offshore drilling has made the U.S. more dependent on imported oil.  And major oil spills are far more likely to occur because of tanker accidents than because of platform or pipeline accidents.
<P>
More important, offshore oil platforms actually protect marine biodiversity.  We often imagine the oceans as teaming with life. In fact, they are mostly vast underwater deserts.  Reefs are the breeding grounds of many marine flora and fauna, providing critical links in the planetary food chain.  In U.S. waters, reefs occur naturally only off the coasts of Florida and Hawaii.  Oil platforms have served as highly efficient artificial reefs, providing habitat shelter for many kinds of fish.  According to environmental scholar Robert J. Smith, biological studies of platform fish populations show concentrations 20-50 times greater than those found in normal sandy bottoms, and about 5 times those found at natural reefs.
<P>
People can create artificial reefs just by dumping durable objects such as rocks and cement-filled tires in sandy bottom waters.  Under the laws of most coastal states, however, private parties cannot establish ownership rights in artificial reefs.  This diminishes the incentive to build reefs, since the full economic benefits cannot be captured by the builders.  More reefs would be built if owners could charge fees to commercial fishermen, scuba clubs, and other interests desiring access.  
<P>
Moreover, owners would have an incentive to prevent overfishing and other environmental hazards that could destroy the long-term value of their property.  Conservation groups could also purchase the rights to such areas and manage them as marine wildlife refuges.
<P>
Market-based solutions to oceanic and atmospheric pollution are in their infancy; but here, too, new technologies promise to reduce our reliance on bureaucratic command-and-control mandates. The major challenge to extending private protection to oceans and airsheds is their fluid nature.  There are no fences separating your air from mine; there is no easy way to trace oceanic pollution to its source.  But we should not underestimate the ingenuity of free peoples to come up with solutions.
<P>
Using technologies known as gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, scientists can detect oceanic pollutants in quantities as small as one part in a trillion.  They can also identify the culprit by matching the pattern of the chemical constituents found in samples taken from the site with others from the suspected source.  This sort of chemical fingerprinting is already being used to determine liability for oil spills.  As the technique becomes more refined and more widely utilized, private parties may be able to sue for damages and make polluters pay.
<P>
Fred Smith foresees even more imaginative applications of technology to pollution control problems:
<P>
&quot;Tracers (oderants, coloring agents, isotopes) might be added to pollutants to ensure the damages were detected early where the costs of reduction were lower....There are exotic technologies that might well play a fencing role even for resources as complex as airsheds.  For example, lasimetrics, a technology which can already map atmospheric chemical concentrations from orbit, might in time provide a sophisticated means for tracking transnational pollution flows.  If that system were combined with a system under which each nation adopted some fingerprinting system to identify its major greenhouse gases (a kind of chemical zip code system), it would be possible to trace pollution to its source and thus make it possible to make polluters pay.&quot;
<P>
Some of this may be a long way off, but if we don't know where we want to go, we can be sure that we will never get there.
<P>
The goal of real environmentalism is to do well today, better tomorrow.  No one knows what kind of fencing and fingerprinting technologies may be available in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century to identify which parties are trespassing (throwing their trash) into which backyards.  Yet, the dynamic record of market economies in finding ever more efficient ways of advancing human goals should inspire confidence and hope.  Private property creates a vast incentive system which encourages people having no direct linkage to a specific industry to seek to solve that sector's problems.   
<P>
These quick sketches do not argue that government has no role to play in the environmental field; preventing trespass and tort-environmental or otherwise-has always been a legitimate function of government.  However, government's role should be limited, and it should not stifle private sector experimentation and initiative.
<center>
<h4>Environment vs. Development: A False Antithesis</h4>
</center>
I've been arguing that private property rights can link ecology and the economy in ways that benefit both.  Green ideologues will vehemently deny this, claiming that economic development and environmental quality are incompatible objectives.  And indeed, if one only considers the well-publicized clashes between environmental groups and commercial interests over the use of public lands such as the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, one may well conclude that we must suppress business to protect the environment or sacrifice the environment to promote business.  But this a false dichotomy, an artificial problem created by government's control over natural resources.
<P>
Some 40 percent of all U.S. land is owned by governments-federal, state, and local.  Many public land tracts contain valuable commercial commodities <I>and</I> valuable ecological resources.  Developers and environmentalists clash over the disposition of those lands precisely because the lands are in the public domain. Each party tries to use its political muscle to deny or restrict access to its rivals.  An outcome that does justice to all the interests concerned is highly unlikely, not only because political power is distributed unequally, but also because the winners have no incentive to accomodate the losers.
<P>
Public policy ought to encourage environmentally responsible behavior.  But people behave responsibly only if they have to bear the costs of their actions.  The problem with public land management is just this:  the costs are borne by taxpayers and other third parties, rather than those who manage or use the land.  The environmental movement does not bear the economic costs-the jobs destroyed, the factories closed, the towns decimated-when it succeeds in locking up timberland or blocking oil production.  Industry, similarly, does not bear the costs when it develops public land in an environmentally destructive manner.  The bureaucrats who are supposed to weigh and balance these competing interests have no financial stake in the lands they manage.  In fact, they may have an incentive to mismanage public lands if the resulting environmental problems create pretexts for increasing agency budgets and enacting new regulations.
<P>
Private ownership, on the other hand, fosters responsible behavior.  In a splendid book entitled <I>Free Market Environmentalism</I>, Terry Anderson and Donald Leal provide several telling examples.  At a time when the federal government was encouraging environmental destruction on the Barrier Islands, commercial interests at Hilton Head Island discovered that conservation increased property values.  While the federal government has subsidized environmental damage in our national forests, companies such as International Paper have discovered that wildlife research and habitat protection can provide profitable recreational opportunities.
<P>
Private property not only encourages industry to respect environmental concerns, it also encourages environmental groups to accomodate economic interests.  Consider the Audubon Society's Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary in Louisiana.  The Rainey Sanctuary is home for deer, armadillo, muskrat, otter, mink, geese, and many other birds.  Since 1960, it has also been a site for oil wells run by Conoco.  Because Audubon owns the land, it can impose strict conditions on how the oil is extracted to ensure that wildlife is not damaged.  In return for allowing the oil company to produce on the sanctuary, Audubon receives royalties that it can plough into its environmental program.  Michigan's Audubon Society has similar arrangements with Mobile and Michigan Petroleum Exploration.   
<P>
These examples are noteworthy, because Audubon and other environmental groups fiercely opposed any oil exploration and production in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge.  Yet they recognize the value of reaching mutually beneficial compromises on their own land.  Private property encourages economically responsible conservation as well as environmentally responsible commercial development.  Audubon profits handsomely from their own oil drilling deals, and it is my understanding that the birds have not suffered a whit.  If private stewardship creates this type of win-win situation, we should try it more often.</FONT>
<center>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
</center>
Ecological central planning cannot protect the environment, but it can destroy civil and economic liberties.  America need not go any farther down this road.  The environment can be protected, and we can continue to reach new heights of prosperity.  Modern societies have succeeded only when ordinary citizens have been free to solve their own problems.  Ecological privatization is an unexplored means of achieving real benefits in the environmental field.
<P>
It's sometimes said that man is the only animal that fouls his own nest.  That's not true.  Most of us don't trash our own homes and gardens.  In fact, we usually don't trash our neighbor's yard.  We are far more likely to litter public streets and parks.  To save the earth, we must ensure that more of it is somebody's back yard.
<P>
It's not too late to rescue America
from centralized ecological planning.  But we must get serious
about shifting the environmental debate from the current <I>market
failure</I> paradigm to one based instead on a <I>failure to allow
markets</I>.  We should offer the American people an alternative
environmental vision-a vision in which each person, by protecting
his own property, protects the planet for the rest of us.  If
we begin now to rescue environmentalism from ideological pollution,
then maybe someday we, too, will have reason to celebrate Earth
Day.

<FONT SIZE=+2> 1)</FONT>   On <I>This Morning</I> on Wednesday, November 6, CBS reporter Troy Roberts began a story: 
<blockquote>
"The pundits had written his political obituary, but last night Newt Gingrich oversaw a
victory, just barely, as voters ratified the two-year-old
revolution that changed the face of Congress. The party retains
control of the House, despite discouraging poll figures about
its leader..."
</blockquote>
<P>
    That view, of the vote ratifying the GOP win in 1994, was
rarely heard on the networks. In fact, no story on the Wednesday
night ABC, CBS or NBC evening shows told viewers that almost all
of the "extremist" freshmen won.
   <P>
 Among the winners, Helen Chenoweth of Idaho. Back on the
October 12 <I>Capital Gang</I>, The Wall Street Journal's Al Hunt
predicted: "I think the Gingrich robots are going to pay a
price. I mean Helen Chenoweth, the militia momma, is toast.
She's gone. Absolutely."
<P>
    Then followed this exchange:
<blockquote>
    Mark Shields: "Helen Chenoweth better start working on her
concession speech."<P>
    Time's Margaret Carlson: "Oh absolutely. Toast. Yeah."
</blockquote>

 Early in the evening, all the networks falsely reported
that Senator Bob Smith would lose in New Hampshire. CBS provided
an explanation for the Republican loss. Bob Schieffer explained:  
 <P>
 <blockquote>  "I think that most Republicans considered Bob Smith, the New
Hampshire incumbent, perhaps, one of their most vulnerable
incumbents. This is a very interesting case Dan, he's a very
conservative Senator in a state that's becoming more moderate.
Most people on the national scene will recall him as the one
that fought against abortion over the past 3 or 4 years and
always brought all those graphic photos out to the Senate floor.
But in our polling, our exit polling today we found that the
moderate voters, 61 percent of them said that they voted for
Dick Swett. This is a state that is simply becoming more
moderate. When we ran this poll I think that almost half of the
people in New Hampshire told us that they now consider
themselves moderate. This used to be a very conservative state
but it got too moderate, I guess, for Bob Smith." 
</blockquote>
    In the end he wasn't too conservative for a newly moderate
state as he won re-election.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="third">
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2> 3)</FONT>
 Speaking of labeling, the networks provided plenty of it
Tuesday night. Senator Paul Wellstone got tagged "liberal" a few
times, but Republicans were described as conservative or "very"
conservative more often, especially on CNN. Some examples:
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- Peter Jennings on ABC: "And the other thing which would
be quite a change, at least in ideological terms, is the
projection you made for Brownback in Kansas. Much more
conservative than the Republicans that Kansas usually sends to
Washington."
<P>
    -- Bob Schieffer on CBS, reporting the Georgia Senate race:
"Max Cleland, the Secretary of State and triple amputee down
there, the most popular vote getter. He even gets more votes
than Sam Nunn over the last 10 years was running against Guy
Millner a very conservative Republican." 
<P>
    -- Bruce Morton on CNN: "And finally Louisiana. That's
Bennett Johnston's old seat, where the Democrat Mary Landrieu is
in a very, very competitive race with a very, very conservative,
but there're a lot of those folks in Louisiana, state
Representative named Woody Jenkins."
<P>
    -- Frank Sesno on CNN: "Onto Illinois now, where Dick Durbin
turns back a challenge from Al Salvi, a very conservative
Republican there, but Dick Durbin winning there."
<P>
    -- Sesno again: "This seat was the one that was vacated when
Robert Dole took his leave to campaign for presidency. Jill
Docking the Democrat against Sam Brownback, very conservative
Republican."
<P>
    -- Morton again: "Still up in the air, Louisiana, where very
conservative Woody Jenkins won that odd, everybody-in primary
that they have."
<P>
    -- Exchange on CNN. Frank Sesno: "Helms ran a series of
really tough ads hitting his opponent Harvey Gantt,
African-American, with liberal liberal liberal label again."
    Bruce Morton: "Well the famous line I guess, more liberal
than Bill Clinton. Gasp! Shudder! Too liberal for North
Carolina. Helms always runs mean ads. I talked to one man down
there who were saying if he was running against Jesus he'd find
a way to attack him."
<P>
    -- Ken Bode on CNN: "That was a very clear choice for the
voters of Louisiana. Mary Landrieu is a moderate at least,
probably a liberal. And the person she was running against,
Woody Jenkins, a state legislator so conservative that in
twenty-some years, twenty-some years in the state legislature,
he did not vote for a single tax increase."
<P>
</blockquote>
    As 1am ET approached, CNN anchor Bernard Shaw assured
viewers: "A lot of Democrats have criticized us in our coverage
and conversely a lot of Republicans have criticized us in our
coverage. Never once in our coverage of this campaign story have
we played favorites. We don't play favorites."

 In speculating about what factors led to Clinton's
comeback, reporters repeatedly committed the biased reporting
that aided Clinton's cause: stating as fact that the GOP shut
down the government without mentioning how Clinton refused to
sign the spending resolutions. Some examples:
<blockquote>
<P>
    -- Bernard Shaw on CNN: "Ken Bode making the point about,
and you Judy, that the President made this comeback, especially
after the disaster of 1994. The Republican Party actually helped
William Jefferson Clinton in that comeback, especially when they
voted to shut down Congress. The American people said the
Republicans went too far. We did not sent you to Washington to
shut down the federal government."
<P>
    -- Sam Donaldson on ABC on why Dole lost: "I think this was
set by two or three people. I think Alan Greenspan, who is the
Fed Chairman, helped engineer an economy that worked and it
worked for President Clinton. I think the Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich helped engineer a shutdown of the Congress twice,
that scared the country and that worked against Senator Dole, it
wasn't Senator Dole's fault...."
<P>
    -- Troy Roberts on Wednesday's <I>This Morning</I> on CBS: "Often
abrasive, Gingrich never mastered the fine art of compromise. 
Less than a year after he rode into Washington in triumph, he
was on the defensive. His gambit to shut down the government
over the budget backfired. Seizing the moment, President Clinton
quickly became the voice of centrist reason."

 Republicans may maintain control of both houses, but
they better not use their position to investigate Clinton
scandals. So warned several network reporters. Some examples:
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw in prime time: "There is also a theory,
however, that if the Republicans begin to engage once again in a
lot of investigations that it will not do well for them four
years from now. Because the country in all the exit polling that
we're seeing so far is saying, 'Hey let's get on with the
business of solving the real problems that we have out there.'"
<P>
    -- NBC's Matt Lauer to Haley Barbour, on the Wednesday,
November 6 <I>Today</I>: "Mr. Barbour, exit polls show us that the
economy was still the number one issue on people's mind last
night. And although character and trust play a role, people
choose candidates based on their handling of the issues. With
that in mind, what do you say to people now who look to
Republicans in Congress and say, hey, move forward on key
legislation. Don't get bogged down on investigations into the
Clinton White House?"
<P>
    -- ABC's John Cochran concluding his November 6 <I>World News
Tonight</I> story on the new Congress: "But both parties know the
public has a limited appetite for partisan head-bashing. And
today Senate Republicans said they had no plans to resume
investigations of the Whitewater affair. John Cochran, ABC News,
Capitol Hill."
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>  6)</FONT>
    None too pleased with the passage of a proposition in
California to end racial discrimination, reporters tagged the
vote a step backward. Examples:
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- NBC's Maria Shriver to Jesse Jackson at about 12:48am ET:
"Affirmative action was a hotbed issue in this country, still a
big race on that subject going on about that in California. Did
you feel at times like we've turned back the clock on some of
these issues?"
<P>
    -- On Wednesday's <I>This Morning</I> co-host Jane Robelot
interviewed California Civil Rights Initiative chief Ward
Connerly:
<P> 
<blockquote>
"Good morning Mr. Connerly. Do you feel like Prop. 209
is going to stand up to the promised court challenges that it
faces?"
<P>
    Ward Connerly: "Absolutely, I think if you read the first
five words of the initiative, which say that the states shall
not discriminate. And by state I mean all governmental agencies
in the state. You recognize that it is already existing law and
the remainder of that first clause,  nor grant preferential
treatment to' and so on is really saying that discrimination
encompasses preferential treatment."
    Robelot: "But that's sort of living in an ideal world I mean
it's nice to say it on paper. If you look around at corporate
offices in America and in CEO's offices, you're gonna see very
few minorities and few women. Are we really ready to backtrack
on civil rights now, or on affirmative action?"
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>  7)</FONT>
     Another election night, another night of wacky comments
from Dan Rather, aka Ratherisms:
<blockquote>
<P>
    -- "Phil Jones is at the Dole HQ in Washington. Phil if you
are a Republican and you're a Bob Dole supporter, seeing New
Hampshire and Florida both fall into the column for Bill
Clinton, is it scary enough to make you swallow your gum?"
<P>
    -- "In Kentucky, in the presidential race, this is the way
it looks. This is with 47 percent of the precincts reporting.
Bill Clinton leading Bob Dole by just about the margin of
cigarette paper."
<P>
   -- "Our CBS news estimates is in one of the nastiest, 
smelliest campaigns of them all -- a lot of people
thought the stench from this would gag a buzzard -- Jeff
Sessions, the Alabama Attorney General, has beaten back the
effort of state senator Roger Bedford, to fill the seat of
retiring Democratic Senator Howell Heflin." 
<P>
    -- "Now, we may see Michael Jackson's baby before we know
the final outcome of this race for the House of Representatives
tonight..."
<P>
    -- In New Hampshire, closest Senate race in the country,
this race between Dick Swett and Bob Smith is hot and tight as a
too small bathing suit on a too long car ride back from the
beach."
<P>
    -- "Reelection of President Bill Clinton is as secure as a
double knot tied with wet rawhide and here's why..." 
<P>
    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw got into the act, offering this
Brokawism: "Just one state now closing its polls at this hour.
It's the home state of the incumbent President of the United
States, the state of Arkansas. No surprise, Bill Clinton now our
projected winner there. For him to lose Arkansas would be like
Elvis losing his hair. He could go on but it just wouldn't be
the same somehow."

     Networks reporters regularly referred to Bob Dole's
"harsh" rhetoric and media professional didn't complain. But in
Thursday's newspapers you may be reading about a critical
comment about Clinton that David Brinkley uttered. At the very
end of ABC's broadcast, just before 1am ET, Sam Donaldson, Cokie
Roberts, Jeff Greenfield, Lynn Sherr, and Hal Bruno stood by the
anchor desk where Peter Jennings and Brinkley sat. 
   <P>
 Jennings asked Brinkley for a final comment. Referring to
the assembled ABC crew, Brinkley announced: "OK, fine, I'm not
going to say much. Among things I admire, almost near the top is
creativeness, and everyone in this group has it. It shows in
your work, it shows in your thinking, and it shows in your
speech, what you do, what you write, what you say, and it's one
reason this group is so terrific. Bill Clinton has none of it,
he has not a creative bone in his body. Therefore, he's a bore
and will always be a bore."
<P>
<BR>
<a name="ninth">
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>  9)</FONT>
     Finally, Wednesday's NBC <I>Nightly News</I> concluded with a
piece from Mike Boettcher on what people want in second term.
Boettcher began: 
<P>
<blockquote>
    "When the sun touched the Pacific, America had made a
decision. Bob Dole's work was over. Bill Clinton's had just
begun. There, in a California night school was the gender gap.
The all-woman sign language class wanted their support for
Clinton rewarded."
  <P>
  Woman in the class: "I want to see a President that stands
for what he believes in and not somebody who just wants to
please the people."
<P>
</blockquote>
    So, someone who doesn't want a President who molds his views
to match polls voted for......Clinton. 
<P>Incredible.

<h2>State Groups That Fight for Mom and Dad</h2>
<b>by Charmaine Crouse Yoest</b>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rudy Gonzalez, a "cowboy poet" with a handlebar mustache and a home-on-the-range accent, strummed his guitar, then launched into a joke. The crowd relaxed into laughter as he regaled them with tall tales and folk wisdom.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is the Idaho Family Forum's annual summer fundraiser, the Spud Bake, where this group of moms and dads marks the end of summer by eating baked potatoes. Lots of them. Followed by spud-shaped ice cream. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But cowboy poetry soon gave way to public policy. U.S. Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~craig/">Larry Craig</a> rose to address the group, and the question-and-answer session that followed was brisk and well informed. The Idaho Family Forum (IFF) and its supporters are dedicated to changing cultural trends that are undermining the stability of families -- from no-fault divorce to teen pregnancy to chronic welfare dependency.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Led by executive director Dennis Mansfield, a former businessman, the IFF is part of a growing national movement of independent, state-based policy organizations called Family Policy Councils (FPCs). There are now more than 30 such organizations across the country, loosely affiliated by shared goals, common strategies, and mutual support. In order to win the ears of lawmakers, the media, and academics, they prefer research over rallies and education over activism.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We are involved in an intellectually muscular and principled persuasion--almost like miniature <i>Crossfires</i> across the nation," says Mansfield. "We're not going to back down from anybody but we're going to use principled persuasion. We believe the weight of the facts wins the day." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like other FPC leaders, Mansfield is a familiar sight in the halls of his state capitol. But there's more to the movement than old-fashioned buttonholing. Legislative battles are really the "outworking of . . . intellectual battles," says Matt Daniels, the executive director of the Massachusetts Family Institute. That means fighting those battles at both the popular and academic levels--from public-service announcements about the benefits of fatherhood to thick policy papers on the social consequences of divorce.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Steve Knudsen, the director of state and local affairs at the <a href="http://www.frc.org">Family Research Council</a>, in Washington, D.C., says that the FPCs exemplify the Jeffersonian ideal of the states as "laboratories of democracy." Now, in the era of devolution--the shifting of resources and responsibility out of Washington--they are strategically placed.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Our focus is on the long term," says Gary Palmer, the executive director of the Alabama Family Alliance. "We work on building relationships with policy-makers. We want to be the ones they turn to when they need accurate, reliable information." In more and more states around the country, FPCs and their staff are playing precisely that role. They advise governors and help craft legislation, they appear on talk shows and write syndicated columns, and they recruit the business and professional community as board members and supporters.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the last decade, 25 new family policy councils have been established, and have been deeply involved in some of their states' most significant battles over policy. The following are a few of their success stories:<a name="mich">
<p><b>Faulting No-Fault Divorce</b>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With 14 full-time staff and a budget of $1.3 million, the Michigan Family Forum is a leader among the FPCs. Its director is Randy Hekman, a former family-court judge with 12 children of his own.MFF laid the groundwork for divorce reform in Michigan in 1995, helping to ignite a similar reform revolution in states across the nation. In the fall, communications director Brian Willats drafted a report called "Breaking Up is Easy To Do: A Look at No-Fault Divorce in the State of Michigan."Filled with research documenting the consequences of family breakdown, it called for a return to the traditional fault system of divorce, except in cases of mutual consent in which minor children are not involved. Perhaps most important, the report called for a "children first" attitude in divorce considerations.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The report was released at a legislative breakfast later that year and produced headlines across the state. State Representative Jessie Dalman then introduced divorce-reform legislation that incorporated the forum's recommendations. The bill became national news: "Michigan could set off a divorce counterrevolution," said the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Dalman's bill was noted by the <i>New York Times, Newsweek</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>. Although the bill failed this year by a single vote, the Michigan Family Forum helped set the terms of what is now a national debate.<p>
<a name="wash"><b>Ads for Dads</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The voice is a dead giveaway. With that familiar, dynamic, raspy Kempian voice, Jeff Kemp couldn't escape identification as the son of the Republican vice presidential nominee if he wanted to. Kemp has followed his father -- first into professional football, and now into politics -- but Jeff has put his own imprimatur on political activism since taking the helm of the Washington Family Council (WFC), an organization with eight full-time employees and a budget of $600,000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Before helping his father campaign, Kemp was busy barnstorming the state promoting the WFC's Fatherhood Initiative. Patterned on the National Fatherhood Initiative, the WFC's effort began with a statewide media barrage about the virtues of being a father. "We wanted to raise the bar for fatherhood," explains Randy Hicks, the WFC's associate director. They ran well-received radio ads produced by James Dobson's Focus on the Family and print ads created by the <a href="/frc">Family Research Council</a>. Both were tailored to address Washington state concerns. ABC's TV affiliate in Seattle soon invited Kemp to join a panel discussion with David Blankenhorn, a leading authority on fatherhood and the author of <i>Fatherless America</i>.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So far, there is no legislative component to the initiative, but the campaign has had far-reaching results. The TV station was flooded with more than 500 calls -- more than it had ever received for any program. WFC prepared "fatherhood packets" -- information about how to strengthen the vital role of fathers in their families -- for these callers. The station then asked the WFC to produce a public-service announcement on fatherhood.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Soon Kemp and Hicks were traveling the state, meeting with managers of television stations to promote the PSA. Eventually every network affiliate in the state (at least a dozen stations) ran the ad. One station alone donated more than $250,000 in air time; a Seattle station was running the ad four times a day.<p>
<a name="ky"><b>Attacking Fluffy Education</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Family Foundation in Lexington, Kentucky, has established itself as an effective voice for conservative pro-family values, particularly in education. Since 1990, with the passage of the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), education has been one of the state's most controversial issues. The reason: The Kentucky education establishment used the Act to introduce outcome-based education and new tests without objective measures and to eliminate grades in primary schools. These "reforms" occurred without parental involvement and have been heralded by the national education establishment as a model reform effort.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The foundation launched the state's most potent criticism of the reforms. It insisted that the legislation's "Academic Expectations" component -- a list of 57 goals that serve as academic standards--was "vague, non-academic, and unmeasurable."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The foundation's arsenal consisted of carefully crafted arguments -- among them a pamphlet comparing  the state goals with standards based on work by former Secretary of Education <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>. Policy analyst Martin Cothran produced a blizzard of material for parents and policy-makers. The <i>Lexington Herald-Leader</i> profiled Cothran, calling him the leader of the opposition. Soon, Kentuckians saw newspaper headlines that read "Proof that KERA works still lacking" and "Discontent with KERA growing." In February, Governor Paul Patton established a task force to study whether the reforms were working.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Changing the law is the ultimate goal, but in the meantime, the foundation is happy to have changed the terms of the debate. "If all we had done was to change the law," says executive director Kent Ostrander, "I would be afraid the results wouldn't be long-term."
<p>
<a name="ala"><b>Betting Against Gambling</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Gary Palmer is another leader working behind the scenes to change his state. A former cost analyst for an engineering company, Palmer is an intense and compelling man with a thousand ideas -- half of which, it seems, he's on his way to achieving. In six years, he has built the Alabama Family Alliance into a $685,000 organization with a full-time staff of 10. "I believe in finding the best people and giving them the opportunity to excel," he says. His group has been so effective that Governor Fob James picked off two of the Family Alliance's top staffers. Palmer hires Ph.D.s for his policy slots and has a first-rate legal staff.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He uses them to great strategic effect. This year the alliance grappled with the gaming industry. Gambling is illegal in Alabama, and the state house of representatives, where all revenue bills must originate, does not favor legalization. So when gambling interests targeted Mobile for expansion this year, they backed a legalization bill written as if it were not a revenue bill, and then introduced it in the state senate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Palmer did not organize any rallies or demonstrations. But he and his staff were ready. Working with a pro-family senator, the alliance helped draft a request for a legal ruling from the state attorney general on the admissibility of a "non-revenue" gambling bill in the senate. The alliance's legal staff shared its extensive research on the case law with the attorney general, who then ruled that the legislation was a revenue bill and could not be introduced in the senate. It was quickly killed.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Policy analyst John Hill prepared a concise assessment of the economic and social costs of gambling. The report exposed state lotteries as a net loss for states using it to bring in revenue. As a result, the mayor of Mobile commissioned 41 local social-service agencies, including the American Red Cross and the United Way, to study the "social impact of gaming."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The conclusion? Fifteen million dollars in extra social-service costs to the city. "An increase in problems and demand for services attributable to gambling abuse or addiction will adversely affect the quality of life in Mobile for all its residents," the final report stated.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 The House GOP freshmen reject this view. We know that government is only a part of society. Society is not a part of government. Government serves as only a portion of the entire society, and is not the entire society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Think of society as a chair. The legs of the chair represent four different and separate institutions. Government is just one leg; the others are families and the institutions that support them, religious and civic institutions, and business.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A stable chair frees you to sit, relax, eat, whatever you want to do, without worrying about falling on the floor. Similarly, the four institutions of society contribute equally to its stability. A child born into a society where all four institutions are healthy has the greatest opportunity for success in life. Consider the child's relationship to these four institutions: When family institutions are healthy, a child is more likely to learn respect for his parents. When government institutions are healthy, a child is more likely to obey the law. In healthy businesses, a child is more likely to learn the work ethic. In healthy religious institutions, a child is more likely to maintain a clear conscience before his or her God. With healthy and equal institutions, we can provide to every individual the freedom and security to pursue the promised opportunity for life, liberty, and happiness.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	During the past 100 years, America's government has become disproportionately large in relation to the country's other institutions. The result has been a burdensome governmental structure involved in virtually every aspect of our lives. The fundamental principles of the New Deal and Great Society programs -- the solving of social ills with governmental programs -- has resulted in a chair so unstable that a single finger can tip it over. Of all the money spent by government, 70 percent is controlled at the federal level, while 30 percent is controlled at the state and local levels. The 537 elected officials in Washington have substituted their "wisdom" for the wisdom of the thousands of local elected officials in our communities. The growth of the governmental leg has drawn too much away from the other core institutions, reducing their effectiveness and creating instability in America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our families have been decimated over the last 30 years by divorce, teen pregnancy, drug abuse, juvenile crime, and failing educational institutions. Religious and civic institutions are not functioning to their full potential. In his article "Bowling Alone" for the <i>Journal of Democracy</i>, Harvard professor Robert Putnam documented the significant decline in "social capital" and in participation in the civic associations of "civil society." In the political arena, declining voter participation and the community's feelings of disempowerment are symptoms of the deterioration of these institutions. In the business realm, our current fascination with "downsizing," layoffs, and superheated stock markets is a result of unstable institutions. The political community is particularly concerned about job insecurity, which has probably exacerbated the decline of business as well as religious and civic institutions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These concerns, I believe, prompted Americans to send a Republican-led Congress to Washington in November 1994. Our new Republican majority went about aggressively downsizing government. We acted on the promises of the Contract With America, like blockgranting programs to the 50 states. We set about reforming or eliminating the myriad federal welfare, job-training, and housing programs. We focused on deregulation and tax reform, trying to encourage the marketplace to shed government control. We even considered eliminating the Departments of Education, Commerce, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, House Republicans failed to communicate a vision of America that included its other core institutions. We did not give enough thought to how families would react to the withdrawal of government from their lives. We did not articulate the need to re-create religious and civic institutions, or to develop self-regulation in the business realm. In short, we only looked at the institution we could influence directly: government. Until we can explain to the American people how we can rebuild the institutions of community while reducing government, then maybe we shouldn't be reducing government at all.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Through its disapproval of the government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996, the American people have told us, "We agree with downsizing government, but we're not going to let you do it unless you can show us how America will be a better place for everybody as a result." Thus the task we freshmen have set ourselves is to articulate our vision of the "New America."<p>	<b>The Legislative Program</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Freshman Class Vision articulates two essential elements (see <a href="#box">box</a>). One element is legislative reform, and the other is a higher level of personal responsibility in society. Both must happen simultaneously. The legislative program continues to be our priority in Washington. We must downsize, restructure, and reform government while we begin to rebuild the other core institutions. Four examples will give some idea of how this might happen:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Social programs.</b> During the 30 or so years of government expansion into welfare, food stamps, and Medicaid, dependency upon government has increased and the ranks of the needy have expanded. Many people believe that the values reflected in social programs and in helping with the care of the needy have a basis in Scripture, not in the Constitution. The Good Samaritan, after all, is found in the Bible. The New America vision calls for the care of the poor to shift from government to religious and civic institutions and the family, where it had historically resided prior to the development of the welfare state.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Churches and faith-based organizations, nonprofit social-service agencies, and charities should have a prime role in providing for those in need. But if we are to begin to rely on nongovernmental institutions, then we must create legislation that encourages this transfer. How can we structure tax policy, for example, to provide a smooth transition from government programs to the religious, civic, and family institutions of this country?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In my opinion, we should encourage religious and civic institutions to take up social programs by giving healthy tax deductions to those contributing money to churches, charities, and other nonprofit groups. Under this policy, institutions caring for the needy expand, while the revenue propping up the government sector shrinks.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Regulation and tax relief.</b> As we reduce taxes and regulation of business, we reduce the overhead of a regulatory government. At the same time, the market will redirect resources currently consumed by taxes and regulatory compliance toward business expansion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Education.</b> Properly handled, reforms in education would help restore the institution of the family. The educational system, a governmental structure, must be accountable to parents, not the state. This can be achieved in part through voucher programs. My personal preference is to increase local control, and therefore encourage parental participation. The most telling problem with education, at least in local school districts, is that local elected officials have very little discretion over school spending; most is determined by state and federal mandates. If we send more dollars unencumbered to the local level, we will encourage more parents to get involved in their children's education. This will encourage parents -- and their children -- to assume personal responsibility for educational decisions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Localizing.</b> Localizing government, as with education, means shifting responsibilities back to the state and local levels. When we localize decisionmaking, we reduce the overhead of the federal government, thereby reducing its role.<p><b>Personal Responsibility</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By downsizing government and reinvigorating other institutions to fulfill their proper roles, we have begun to address our obligations as the freshmen elected in 1994. We have taken a necessary, though not sufficient, first step toward a New America.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Still, something is missing. The nongovernmental institutions are not functioning to their full capacity. By encouraging local control and involvement, we may have begun to address issues like juvenile crime and school accountability. Our problems, however, demand another, essential element: personal responsibility.


<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Congress cannot raise the conscience of the American people, decrease our reliance on governmental institutions, and encourage the development of individual and community-based solutions to community problems. Personal responsibility cannot be legislated in Washington. We can't create good parents by passing a law. We can't make everybody go to church or other religious institutions or be ethical in business. There are some things that even Great Society advocates would agree government simply cannot do. Encouraging and creating personal responsibility is ultimately the task of the nation's religious institutions. It must happen in concert with downsizing government, and won't happen without it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Family institutions.</b> For members of a family, taking personal responsibility means meeting obligations, participating in family activities, and raising children well.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Business institutions.</b> Encouraging personal responsibility in business institutions would accomplish at least two things. One result would be fewer lawsuits; another would be the development of peer review, such as doctors policing doctors, lawyers policing lawyers, and like businesses policing one another. Peer review would achieve a more cost-effective regulatory scheme than government, with better results.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Governmental institutions.</b> We need to spread responsibility among the tens of thousands of state and local elected officials across the country. By raising the conscience of the American people, we can eventually change the distribution of government resources from 70 percent controlled at the federal level to 70 percent controlled at the state and local levels.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The central challenge is to downsize government in a responsible fashion that rebuilds the other core institutions in this country until they all achieve a final equality and balance. It is a huge job. It is one my colleagues and I face every day, and it will require the ongoing support of the American people. But it is a task we must accomplish to restore the stability of the American Dream and to provide freedom and security for all.

<h3>Blueprint To Renew Society</h3><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In order to provide greater freedom and security, the 74 members of the Republican Freshman Class stand for structural reform in America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We believe that government is too big in relation to other institutions in America.  We believe that reducing government should not, and cannot, occur without renewal of family, religious/ civic, and business institutions in American society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A balanced budget that privatizes, localizes, and eliminates federal government activities is the blueprint to renew society.  To renew society, however, the conscience of the American people must be raised, increasing personal responsibility and hence the effectiveness of all of our institutions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our vision is one in which family, religious/civic, business, and government institutions contribute equally to the foundation of a New America.

<h3>Where Do The Presidential Candidates Stand on Term Limits??
</h3></center>
<p>
<p>
ABIC has pulled together information from many sources, including press clippings, candidate questionnaires and candidate statements to put together a picture of where each presidential candidate stands on this important reform issue.  We've gathered what information we could about some of the key presidential candidates--if you have more information that can be substantiated, please let us know!
<p>
<b>The candidates:</b>
<p>
<center><h3>Bill Clinton (Democrat)</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Position on Term Limits</b>: Opposes
<p>
<i>What is he saying about term limits?
</i><p>
"No.  I share with supporters of congressional term limits their goal to reform our political system and renew our democracy.  I do not, however, believe that term limits are the appropriate means to achieve this desirable end."
<h6><p align="right">--USAToday (10/15/96), Answer to Candidate Questionnaire<br>
(Question: Do you support congressional term limits?)</p>
</h6><p>
"I've had my own reservations about term limits because I didn't necessarily think that -- as a national thing -- because I didn't necessarily think that voters in one state ought to tell voters in another how long they ought to b able to vote for the people of their choice."
<h6><p align="right">--telephone interview with the Denver Post (5/30/95)
</p></h6><p>
"I know they're popular, but I'm against them."
<h6><p align="right">--Presidential Debate in Richmond, Virginia (10/15/92)
</p></h6><p>
<i>What has he done?</i>
<p>
In 1992, the same year he was elected president, the voters of Bill Clinton's home state of Arkansas passed term limits for their own congressional delegation.  When the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of this law reached the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of 1994, President Clinton had his Solicitor General argue against the law before the High Court and against the voters of his own home state.  Ultimately the Court agreed with the President and overturned Arkansas' term limits law.
<p>
Since then, while Congress has attempted to pass a term limits constitutional amendment through both the House and Senate, the President stood by while members of his own party fought against the amendment in both chambers.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<center><h3>Bob Dole (Republican)</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Position on Term Limits:</b> Supports
<p>
<i>What is he saying about term limits?
</i><p>
 "As president, I will push for an amendment to the Constitution that establishes a two-term limit for senators and a six-term limit for House members. I will continue to press for legislation that limits the power of special interest groups and makes representatives more accountable to their constituents. These decisive steps will further enhance the confidence of the electorate in Congress, and the laws it developed, as we enter the 21st century."
<h6><p align="right">--USAToday (10/15/96), Answer to Candidate Questionnaire<br>
(Question: Do you support congressional term limits?)</p>
</h6><p>
<i>What has he done?
</i><p>
In the early days of this Congress, then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole promised that the Senate would have a vote on the term limits constitutional amendment.  In April of this year, he kept his promise and brought the amendment to the floor of the Senate for a vote.  Unfortunately, the Democrats filibustered, preventing the Senate from ever having a vote on the actual amendment.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<center><h3>Ross Perot (Reform Party)</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Position on Term Limits:</b> Supports
<p>
<i>What is he saying about term limits?
</i><p>
"Yes. Our elected leaders must realize that serving the American people is a privilege, not a career. Seventy-four percent of the American people support term limits. It is time we passed a constitutional amendment limiting congressional terms."

<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For nearly 40 years, my grandma taught poor immigrant first-graders in Brooklyn to read. She also taught remedial reading to teenagers who had somehow never mastered the written word. She was a marvelous teacher who combined patience, affection, and phonics, which she always said was the best way to learn. And at her funeral, many of her former pupils showed up to honor her memory.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Your grandmother gave me a gift I will never forget," one of them told me. "When she taught me to read, she changed my life. She opened doors that had slammed shut on me. She made it possible for me to succeed." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I thought of my grandmother when I heard President Clinton's stirring call for a national literacy campaign at the Democratic convention in August. "Let us set a clear national goal," Clinton said. "All children should be able to read on their own by the third grade." Yes, I thought, the president is right on target: Literacy is the key to all other learning. Unless he can read, a child is doomed. And Grandma would have applauded Clinton's infectious, can-do spirit. She always insisted that <i>every</i> child could be taught to read. 
<p><table width="170" align="left" cellpadding="3">

<td>
<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>President Clinton uses the language of personal responsibility to promote and perpetuate government irresponsibility</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Grandma also would applaud the precise, measurable standard the president set for his campaign. This is not some slippery, Goals 2000-type call to raise self-esteem or ensure children enter school "ready to learn." This is a real test measuring essential knowledge, the kind of test that good teachers prize. Either a child can read or he can't, in which case some other way to teach him must be found. And it's a badly needed test because, as President Clinton reminded us, 40 percent of eight-year-olds have serious reading difficulties.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The president's literacy proposal is attractive for other reasons. It calls not for a new bureaucratic program but rather a volunteer army of 1 million reading tutors. This is consistent with Clinton's appreciation of civil society and the American tradition of citizens stepping forward to solve the problems of their communities. So far so good. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But wait a minute: Where's the accountability for teachers? Just what are they supposed to be doing, if not teaching our children to read? If 40 percent of eight-year-olds have trouble reading, what's wrong with our public schools? Shouldn't we hire better teachers who can teach reading the way Grandma did? And why aren't problem readers helped by the $30 billion-plus we spend each year on special education?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The literacy proposal is typical of Clinton at his best and at his worst. He has a brilliant knack for focusing the nation's attention like a laser beam on a profound problem. He laces his solutions with culturally conservative notions such as rigorous testing and volunteerism rather than bureaucracy. But he totally ignores the need to reform existing institutions that are already expected to address the problem; in this case, he absolves the schools of their failure to teach. <i>President Clinton uses the language of personal responsibility to promote and perpetuate government irresponsibility.</i> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Clinton has defined himself as a cultural conservative. There are a few issues where he is on the cultural left: abortion, where he defends even a grisly procedure bordering on infanticide, and civil rights, where he defends racial preferences that violate the principle of equality before the law. On gay rights, he sends mixed signals. But on most social issues, Clinton is the most culturally conservative Democratic presidential nominee since Hubert Humphrey, perhaps even since Harry Truman. Consider the Clinton record:
<p>
<ul><li>	He has issued guidelines calling for more teaching about religion in public schools; during his presidency, National Public Radio and PBS have finally begun treating religion with respect. <li>	He has promoted the V-chip for TV sets to give parents more control over what their children watch.<li>	Over the objections of the American Civil Liberties Union, he has signed "Megan's Law"-style legislation to keep parents informed of convicted sex offenders living in their neighborhoods.<li>	He has endorsed youth curfews and school uniforms -- seemingly small measures, but a significant rebuke to "children's-rights" activists within the Democratic party who oppose any restrictions on the freedom of minors.<li>	He has said Dan Quayle was right about the irreplaceable benefits of the two-parent family.<li>	He and the First Lady have spoken out frequently about the importance of adoption, and, over the objections of the National Association of Black Social Workers, the president signed GOP legislation overturning barriers to transracial adoption.<li>	He has embraced the principles of the Founding in defining what it means to be an American: "If you believe in the values of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, if you are willing to work hard and play by the rules, you are part of our family."<li>	He has signed legislation protecting states from being forced to recognize homosexual marriages.<li>	He says that the three central principles of the Democratic Party in this election are "opportunity," "responsibility," and "community."<li>	Most prominently, despite the opposition of his party's left wing, the president signed the Republican welfare-reform legislation abolishing Aid to Families with Dependent Children as an entitlement and sending a clear signal that society expects able-bodied welfare recipients to work.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These moves to the center cannot be brushed off simply as election-year posturing or Dick Morris's triangulation strategy. Many of the president's cultural proposals reflect the work of William Galston, Elaine Kamarck, and other New Democrats associated with the communitarian movement and the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org">Progressive Policy Institute</a>. And Clinton targets cultural conservatism not just to swing voters but to the traditional base of the Democratic party. For instance, in 1993 at the Tennessee church where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his final sermon, Clinton imagined what Dr. King might say today:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"He would say, 'I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed.' 'I fought for freedom,' he would say, 'but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandon; not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them as if they don't amount to anything. . . . This is not what I lived and died for.' "<p><b>Co-Conspirator in Evasion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Clinton, in short, is guiding Democrats to a greater appreciation of family and religion and community. But he still promotes government's massive flight from responsibility. For the past 30 years, American mayors and governors have sought to deflect responsibility for failing schools, rising crime rates, and welfare dependency. "Don't blame us," the mayors and governors have said, "blame the federal government, which hasn't given us enough money." President Clinton is a co-conspirator in this strategy of evasion. He may say that "the era of Big Government is over," but he is expanding federal responsibility in a way that diffuses the accountability of public officials.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Consider the president's much-trumpeted funding of "100,000 new police officers" for America's communities. In truth, Clinton's crime initiative has funded 20,000 new cops, a 3 percent addition to existing police forces. But the president has given America's mayors something more important than the few new officers in each city. Now the federal government shares responsibility for police protection. Cities can now cut their own funding of law enforcement with the expectation that the feds will make up the difference. Even better, the mayors can now blame Newt Gingrich and "GOP budget-cutting" for the failures of their own police departments.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Senator Dole has contributed to this irresponsibility, too. He has campaigned as if local law enforcement were the president's job. The real issue should not be whether Bill Clinton or Bob Dole is tougher on crime. The real issue is why city governments, run mostly by liberal Democrats, can't protect their citizens. If Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and police chief William Bratton can cut crime by 35 percent in New York City, why can't Mayors Marion Barry and Ed Rendell do the same in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia? If California can cut crime by 9 percent in one year with a "three strikes and you're out" law, why can't other states? Americans ought to be asking themselves these questions, but with Dole's help, Clinton has muddied these comparisons by claiming a central role for the federal government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps no Clinton initiative promotes government irresponsibility more than his favorite, AmeriCorps. Modeled on the military, AmeriCorps has many culturally conservative attributes. It is dedicated to service, volunteerism, and duty to country. AmeriCorps sends its members to many fine organizations that foster personal responsibility. One such group, <a href="http://www.habitat.org">Habitat for Humanity</a>, promotes home ownership, self-help, and sweat equity as it helps low-income people build their own houses. 

<p><table width="170" align="right" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td>
<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>No, Mrs. Clinton, it doesn't take a president to raise a child. If everyone's responsible, no one's responsible.</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But for all its emphasis on personal responsibility, AmeriCorps aggravates the crisis in government irresponsibility. It is a federal organization parachuting into local communities to solve local problems -- helping a charter school in Oakland, a community-service program in Dallas, a police-cadet program in New York City. Many of these are worthy causes, but AmeriCorps usurps local responsibility. Local governments and private funders have the greatest stake in the success of such programs. They are also in the best position to hold them accountable for how money is spent. But these local institutions are less likely to seek or finance promising solutions if they think AmeriCorps will do it for them.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	AmeriCorps fosters irresponsibility in another way. The federal government now does so many things that it does nothing very well. At a time when government should focus on what it does best and what it alone can do, why is Clinton inflating an already-bloated public sector with volunteer organizations such as Habitat for Humanity that can prosper without government help?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Clinton's diffusion of responsibility is best reflected, of course, in the First Lady's breathtaking statement at the Democratic convention that "it takes a president" to raise a child. No, Mrs. Clinton, moms and dads raise children. Parents can be helped by a village, properly understood: by relatives, teachers, clergy, police, neighbors. But a village defined as a national community can't help them in any meaningful way. Children are in trouble today precisely because moms and dads -- and neighbors and relatives -- are abdicating their responsibility and expecting the president to come to the rescue.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In his convention speech in August, the president defended welfare reform by saying, "Now there's no more 'Who's to blame?' on welfare. Now the only question is 'What to do?,' and we all have a responsibility." Therein lies the essence of Clintonism. Hold everyone responsible, hold no one accountable. When everyone has a responsibility, no one can be blamed when programs fail. And, if we take seriously the history of welfare, fail they will.

<title>New Foreign Policy Credo: Be Prepared  - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>NEW FOREIGN POLICY CREDO: BE PREPARED</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 24, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 1996 election campaign has been conspicuously quiet on foreign policy. Both major presidential candidates, catering to a post-Cold War public glad to be rid of the constant nuclear threat from the Soviet Union, have avoided the subject, thinking they were following the prudent political course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I disagree: Leadership requires more than merely reflecting the momentary concerns of the electorate. It requires not just talking about what people say they are concerned about, but also pointing out what they ought to be concerned about. And they ought to be concerned about foreign policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 The truth is that the United States is handling foreign policy challenges like Iraq, Bosnia, North Korea and Haiti on an ad hoc basis -- without adequate contingency plans already in place when trouble strikes. What this means is that it is only a matter of time before America is caught unprepared and becomes unnecessarily involved in another war or some other international crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	
In the post-Cold War era, the United States has failed to set clear and meaningful criteria for action, stick to those criteria, and effectively communicate them to friends and enemies alike so other nations can predict how we will respond in a given situation. Without such guidelines, friends are left not knowing whether they can count on us, enemies are encouraged to test the waters to see what they can get away with, and our military is involved in matters best handled by other countries or by international social workers.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The White House should be formulating its plans for dealing with possible foreign policy crises now -- based on a clear understanding of U.S. interests and capabilities to shape events -- not after events start spinning out of control. Here is a "top-10 list," if you will, of worst-case foreign-policy scenarios the White House should be prepared to deal with should they arise, arranged in order from least to most likely: 
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #10</b> &#160; &#160;Civil war in Russia divides control of Russia's nuclear forces between various political and military factions. Based on false information that the United States is about to intervene militarily, a rogue commander authorizes a nuclear attack on the United States or U.S. forces in Europe. Unlikely, to be sure, but not impossible;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #9</b>  &#160; &#160;Next year, China decides to turn up the heat on Taiwan by establishing a naval blockade of that island nation or threatening a ballistic missile attack;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Scenario #8</b>  &#160; &#160;Iran tries to close down the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, bottling up some 20 percent of the world's oil supplies, or helps topple the monarchy in Saudi Arabia;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #7</b>  &#160; &#160;An Iraqi-backed terrorist group attacks U.S. troops in Kuwait with biological weapons -- anthrax spores, for example -- killing hundreds of American soldiers. However, no one takes credit and no one is sure who did it;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #6</b>  &#160; &#160;Russia threatens the Baltic states -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- with military action in response to NATO's decision to include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in the alliance;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #5</b>  &#160; &#160;Boris Yeltsin dies and new Russian elections result in the rise of an unpredictable, anti-Western president like Alexander Lebed.  Or Yeltsin doesn't die, but becomes incapacitated, setting off a dangerous succession struggle in the Kremlin that destabilizes Russia;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #4</b>  &#160; &#160;Saddam Hussein shoots down a U.S. plane in the newly expanded no-fly zone in Northern Iraq and takes its pilot hostage;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #3</b>  &#160; &#160;North Korea decides to go down fighting, invades the South, overruns most of the 37,000 U.S. troops along the demilitarized zone, and reduces most of Seoul to rubble;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #2</b>  &#160; &#160;China decides to crack down on Hong Kong next year after the former British colony reverts to Beijing's rule;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #1</b> &#160; &#160;U.S. troops stay in Bosnia past the promised December deadline for withdrawal, and dissatisfied groups decide to eject the Americans by force, or radical Moslem terrorists launch attacks on remaining U.S. troops.
</blockquote>	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Does the administration have contingency plans in place should any of the above scenarios arise? To judge from its conduct so far on the world stage, it is highly improbable.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No administration, Republican or Democrat, should operate in the foreign policy arena without clearly understanding how America's interests would best be served in such crisis scenarios. Unless U.S. policy-makers are prepared to act with determined vision in the post-Cold War world, they place America at risk.

<center><i>Entrepreneurship Matters</i></center>
<P>
Entrepreneurship serves as fuel for the economy.  Entrepreneurs
are the ultimate source of innovation, invention, creativity,
and efficiencies that drive economic growth.
<P>
In turn, vigorous job creation depends upon the health of entrepreneurs
and small businesses.  Indeed, small to mid&#173;size firms (500
employees or less) account for about 70 percent to 80 percent
of new jobs created.
<P>
Given the central role of entrepreneurs and small businesses in
the economy, the impact of public policies on entrepreneurship
looms as a paramount concern.
<P>
Policies that are truly pro&#173;entrepreneur and pro&#173;small&#173;business
enhance incentives for working, investing, and risk taking, and
free up resources from government for private&#173;sector uses.
 These policies are no mystery: lower taxes, elimination of excessive
regulations, and smaller government.
<P>
Quite naturally, presidential leadership on small business issues
is critical.
<P>
<a name="two">
<center><i>The Clinton Plan</i></center>
<P>
President Clinton's economic plan faced an enormous obstacle before
even being formulated, i.e., previous anti&#173;entrepreneur measures
offered by the Clinton Administration.  The President's massive
1993 tax increase hit small businesses hard.  In fact, according
to the congressional Joint Economic Committee, small business
owners were saddled with the brunt of the increase in income tax
rates under the 1993 tax hike.  (See chart on following page.)
<P>
In addition, small businesses would have been devastated by mandates
and higher costs under the President's proposed federal takeover
of the nation's health care system.
<P>
Along with other anti&#173;small&#173;business initiatives (like
the minimum wage increase), the Clinton economic plan faces a
fairly deep hole from which to climb out.
<P>
The following Clinton proposals would directly impact entrepreneurs
and small business:
<ul>
<li>Limited expansion of IRAs for education, retirement and first&#173;time
home buying.  These measures would have a minor favorable impact
on small business by increasing incentives for saving and investment.
 However, the beneficial effects are limited by income caps.<BR>
<P>
<li>Welfare&#173;to&#173;work tax credit for employers hiring
welfare recipients (50 percent tax credit on first $10,000 of
wages and benefits &#173;&#173; available for two years) and an
expansion of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.  This is a slight
boost for businesses willing and able to hire welfare recipients.
<li>Provide a tax incentive for businesses to undertake hazardous
waste site clean&#173;ups in distressed communities.  Such an
incentive amounts to little when compared with the federal government's
costly, unfair, and litigious policies regarding waste sites under
Superfund.
<li>Expand the number of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.
 Empowerment Zones offer rather minor tax breaks for businesses,
while Enterprise Communities merely allow for the distribution
of federal government pork.
<li>A series of tax increases (many rather technical) are proposed
to offset estimated revenue losses from other tax cuts and increased
programs.  These tax hikes include reforming depreciation deductions
to account more accurately for expected future income; restricting
interest deductions for corporations that invest in tax&#173;exempt
bonds; increase in the per&#173;passenger tax for international
flights from $6 to $16; eliminate $3.4 billion in unspecified
corporate &quot;subsidies&quot; (not specific &#173;&#173; good
idea if cutting back on corporate welfare; bad idea if tax increases);
establish a new $225 charge per flight, phased in over 3 years
for commercial and private corporate turbo jets and turbo prop
planes; establish a graduated filing fee structure according to
asset size for firms seeking to merge; eliminate the 70 percent
and 80 percent dividends&#173;received deductions for certain
debt&#173;like stock; impose a fee of $1 per check paid by the
U.S. government to its vendors; and more.
</ul>
The problem with this proposal is that the economy is not receiving
a full net tax cut, but merely replacing one kind of taxation
for another, with no clear benefits for pro&#173;growth economic
incentives.
<P>
<i>Clinton Plan: D&#173;<br></i>
<P>
Comment: The Clinton economic plan offers little hope that  current
tax and regulatory burdens will be eased any time soon.  This
plan fails to relieve any of the misery imposed on small businesses
in the 1993 tax hike.  No regulatory relief is provided.  And
no indications exist that government will be getting any smaller.
 Indeed, the few, minor tax cuts offered are not broad&#173;based
(government once again mistakenly tries to decide how best to
allocate resources) and are offset by other tax increases.  <BR>
<P>
Especially in light of the 1993 tax increase, the near catastrophic
health care plan, and other anti&#173;entrepreneur initiatives
over the past four years, the Clinton economic plan could have
easily warranted a failing grade.  Only minor enhancements in
incentives for savings salvaged a non&#173;failing grade.  Indeed,
considerable grade generosity was used in assigning a D&#173;
to the Clinton plan.<BR>
<P>
In the context of initiatives already advanced by the Clinton
Administration, entrepreneurs and small business generally remain
losers under the Clinton plan.<BR>
<P>
When entrepreneurs and small businesses lose, so does the economy.
 The Clinton Administration's projection of an under&#173;performing
economy &#173;&#173; with a real annual average economic growth
rate of 2.3 percent for the foreseeable future &#173;&#173; is
probably pretty accurate given this economic plan.  Though growth
could certainly wane further.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three">
<I>The Dole Plan<BR></I>
<P>
A Dole economic plan faced far less anti&#173;entrepreneurial
baggage than the Clinton plan.  Though, Dole's support for both
sizable tax increases (e.g., 1982 and 1990) and tax cuts (e.g.,
1981 and 1986, along with opposition to the 1993 tax hike) created
a more ambiguous environment.<BR>
<P>
The following Dole proposals would directly impact entrepreneurs
and small business:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li>A 15 percent across&#173;the&#173;board personal income tax
cut.  An across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income taxes
benefits entrepreneurs and business in two primary ways: 1) incentives
for working, investing and risk taking are boosted; and 2) the
bottom line for most enterprises is directly impacted (79 percent
of all business tax returns are filed by non&#173;corporations
&#173;&#173; partnerships and sole proprietorships &#173;&#173;
and this rate jumps to almost almost 89 percent when accounting
for S&#173;Corporations).  <BR>
<dd>The only problems with this measure is that rates are not cut
deep enough (for example, after the Dole tax cut is fully implemented
the top tax rate will rest at 33.7 percent, still above the top
rate of 28 percent under President Reagan), or quickly enough
(phasing in the tax cut over three or four years will only delay
its benefits).<BR>
<li>A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax, dropping
the top rate from 28 percent to 14 percent.  No other public policy
step, perhaps barring a complete overhaul of our present tax system,
reaps more rewards for entrepreneurs and the economy than capital
gains tax reduction.  Incentives for investing and risk taking
will rise considerably under a 50 percent cut in the capital gains
tax rate.
<li>A cut in the estate tax by excluding an additional $1 million
of value from an estate for qualified family&#173;owned businesses.
 The estate tax amounts to nothing more than a government hostile
takeover of a business at death.  A cut in the estate tax will
boost incentives for investment and allow many family businesses
to live on and prosper.  The only problem with this proposal is
its somewhat limited scope.
<li>
Expansion of IRAs for retirement and education.  These measures
would have a minor favorable impact on small business by increasing
incentives for saving and investment.
<li>
Repeal the 1993 tax hike on Social Security benefits.  Older
entrepreneurs &#173;&#173; perhaps retired from their original
jobs and trying to launch or expand a business &#173;&#173; will
benefit from a rollback in the 1993 tax increase on Social Security
benefits.
<li>
Regulatory reform including requiring that new regulations
pass muster of cost&#173;benefit analysis, risk assessment, and
independent peer&#173;review; new regulations be re&#173;evaluated
every four years; and a regulatory sunsetting task force review
all federal regulations with an eye toward eliminating the ineffective.
 Regulations have the same impact as do taxes &#173;&#173; raising
the costs of starting up, running, and expanding a business. 
Establishing a regulatory system where regulations must stand
up to more rigorous assessments before being implemented, and
afterwards being subject to regular review and sunsetting, amounts
to a major step in the right direction in regulatory policy.
<li>
Legal system reforms including a limit on punitive damages
in certain cases; abolishing joint and several liability for non&#173;economic
damages in civil cases; and curbing the use of contingency fees.
<BR>
<DD>Our current legal system can inflict considerable and sometimes
irreparable damage on small businesses, entrepreneurs, and our
economy.  Beginning to reform perverse liability schemes and limiting
some damages make for a good start.
<li>
Establish a clear, meaningful home&#173;office tax deduction
for home&#173;based businesses.  Home&#173;based businesses are
rapidly expanding as our economy decentralizes.  These home&#173;based
entrepreneurs need to operate under a clear set of tax rules,
and stop being eyed with suspicion by the IRS.
<li>
Reform independent contractor rules.  The question of who
is or is not classified by the IRS as an independent contractor
has long plagued small businesses and the self&#173;employed.
Clarity and simplicity are surely needed.
<li>
Boost the tax deduction for health insurance costs for the
self&#173;employed to 100 percent.  The self&#173;employed deserve
the same health insurance deduction as is provided for employer&#173;provided
health plans.
<li>
Sets out a long&#173;term goal of overhauling our current
tax code in favor of a fairer, flatter, simpler tax system.  Replacing
our current tax code makes sense.  The current code is riddled
with problems: tax rates are too high; capital taxed too heavily;
it's complicated and unclear; incentives for tax avoidance abound;
it's intrusive and bureaucratic; and it is set up to easily feed
government growth.
</ul>
<P>
The Dole plan deserves credit for noting the need to overhaul
the tax system, but disappoints in that it lacks a clear alternative
with a timetable.<BR>
<P>
<center><i>Dole Plan: B+</i></center>
<P>
Comment: The Dole economic plan amounts to an excellent start
at reducing the governmental burdens imposed on small businesses
and entrepreneurs.  Tax cuts, regulatory reform, and legal reforms
are all desperately needed. <BR>
<P>
While grading on the Clinton plan was generous, a grade of B+
for the Dole plan is a far tougher grade.  The Dole plan fell
short of a grade of A due to what it lacked.  Much more can be
done to spur entrepreneurship, like eliminating capital gains
and estate taxes, instituting deeper cuts in tax rates, and proposing
tougher regulatory standards (e.g., requiring Congress and the
president to sign off on all rules and regulations).  And as already
noted, a complete overhaul of our current tax code  is needed
rather quickly.
<P>
On whole, however, entrepreneurs and small businesses would be
winners under the Dole economic plan.
<P>
Naturally, in turn, the economy should grow at a faster pace.
 Current Administration assumptions place the average annual real
rate of economic growth at 2.3 percent into the foreseeable future.
 Such rates would grossly under&#173;perform the post&#173;Civil
War average rate of 3.5 percent.  The Dole camp projects that
real economic growth rates will average about 2.8 percent over
the next six years.  That is, the Dole changes will be worth about
0.5 percentage points in growth each year versus current projections.
 A new report by Gary and Aldona Robbins for the Institute for
Policy Innovation estimates an average annual percentage point
boost to real growth over the next six years of 0.55.
<P>
Given the economy's long&#173;term growth trend, these certainly
are not wild&#173;eyed projections.  In fact, they are conservative
as they only attempt to quantify and estimate the growth effects
of the tax cuts and do not take into account the impact of regulatory
and legal reforms, for example.
<P>
<a name="four">
<center><i>The Ideal: An A+ Economic Plan</i></center>
<P>
The following is offered as a model framework for an economic
plan that will boost investment, entrepreneurship, and economic
growth.<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li>In the short run, cut income taxes across the board, and eliminate
the anti&#173;entrepreneur capital gains and estate taxes.
<li>In the longer run, replace our current messy, counter&#173;productive
tax system with a low&#173;rate, simple, consumption&#173;based
tax.  A low flat&#173;rate income tax or a low&#173;rate (i.e.,
less than 10 percent) national retail sales tax make sense.  
<li>A massive deregulation effort must be implemented.  This means
not only rolling back current onerous regulations, but establishing
a system that helps to prevent the imposition and continuation
of costly regulations, including congressional approval of all
rules and regulations, sunsetting regulations, and using sound
science&#173;based risk assessment and cost&#173;benefit analysis
when evaluating possible new or renewal of current regulations.
<li>Dramatic reductions in the size of government &#173;&#173;
federal, state, and local &#173;&#173; must occur.  Privatization,
competitive contracting, and cutbacks in and elimination of wasteful
programs must be implemented in order to cut government spending
and free up resources for more productive private&#173;sector
uses.
</ul>
<P>
Also, free trade and sound money are needed as foundations upon
which risk taking and the economy can flourish.  Indeed, this
pro&#173;entrepreneur agenda would more than likely place the
U.S. economy on a track above its post&#173;Civil War real average
growth rate.
<P>
As noted earlier, no mystery needs to be solved.  The policies
that benefit entrepreneurs, small business, and the economy are
clear: low taxes, elimination of excessive regulations, and small
government.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is considering how to help state and local officials combat violent teenage crime. In the House of Representatives, the most prominent proposal is the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565), sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime. The McCollum bill would change the federal criminal justice system by mandating that juveniles who commit two types of federal crime -- serious violent crimes or major drug trafficking offenses -- will be tried as adults in federal courts; it also would impose mandatory minimum sentences on juveniles who use firearms in the commission of a federal crime. In the Senate, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act of 1996 (S. 1854), sponsored originally by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and former Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), would make similar improvements in federal law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the Hatch and McCollum bills would give states financial assistance to help them combat juvenile crime. The McCollum bill would replace the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) with a new Office of Juvenile Crime Control. In addition to serving as a clearinghouse for information disseminated to state officials, this office would make $500 million available to the states: $250 million in the form of "incentive grants" to help the states adopt needed reforms -- for example, tougher sanctions on juvenile criminals, mandatory restitution, and greater public availability of juvenile delinquency records -- and another $250 million in the form of block grants for the states to use as they think best in combating and preventing juvenile crime.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>State and Local Responsibility.</b> While Congress can assist local officials with block grants, however, taxpayers know that violent juvenile crime, like street crime in general, is primarily a state and local responsibility. And while the capacity of all government officials to cope with the broader cultural and social changes that appear to be driving increased juvenile criminal behavior is limited, state and local officials still can take decisive steps to curb violent juvenile crime.<sup>2</sup>  They can do this by using their police forces more effectively and by integrating innovative community police work with the efforts of community leaders and other agencies in the criminal justice system. This is happening already in such localities as New York City and Charleston, South Carolina. The McCollum bill would help the states by removing the federal mandates that prevent them from adopting many innovative solutions and by providing funds for effective new programs, including the Serious Habitual Offenders Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

SHOCAP is one of the most effective ways to attack the juvenile crime explosion. With sophisticated information technology, local officials can develop and share crime analysis and case management files on the most serious violent offenders in the community: serious habitual offenders. This pioneering effort to combine police work with emerging information technology, developed by a team of experts in the Justice Department during the Reagan Administration, combines the modern microelectronic revolution, sophisticated data collection and crime analysis, and community police work. Through computer analysis and effective local policing, it enables state and local law enforcement officials to identify, target, arrest, and incarcerate violent teenage criminals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In order to institute SHOCAP, state and local officials should:
<p><ul>
<li> Establish an interagency council chaired by the chief of police and comprised of the CEOs of SHOCAP component agencies -- juvenile probation departments, prosecutors, juvenile judges, schools, social services, and public housing.
<p>
<li> Create or enhance crime analysis units within local police departments.
<p>
<li> Enlist the cooperation of state and local agencies in collecting and analyzing data, updating the case files of serious habitual offenders (SHOs), and establishing a strategy for dealing with this class of offenders.
<p>
<li> Identify serious habitual offenders. Approximately 6 percent of all juvenile offenders are responsible for up to 63 percent of violent juvenile crime.<sup>3</sup>  The procedure used to identify and classify these offenders should be rigorous; it should include, for example, an examination of previous offenses, arrest and court records, and social and family histories. Responsible officials then should use the information developed through this process to create sophisticated, computerized case management files.
<p>
<li> Share these case management files with police officials, judges, prosecutors, state probation and parole agencies, and (as needed) schools and social service agencies.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, states should reform the juvenile justice system by enacting laws to try violent juvenile criminals as adults when necessary, and by passing truth-in-sentencing laws that apply to violent juvenile offenders tried as adults.
<p>

<b>THE NEW FACE OF JUVENILE CRIME</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Violent teenage criminals are increasingly vicious. John DiIulio, Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton University, says that "[t]he difference between the juvenile criminals of the 1950s and those of the 1970s and early 1980s was the difference between the Sharks and the Jets of <i>West Side Story</i> and the Bloods and the Crips. It is not inconceivable that the demographic surge of the next ten years will bring with it young criminals who make the Bloods and the Crips look tame."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to the Council on Crime in America, a bipartisan commission chaired by former Attorney General Griffin Bell and former White House Drug Policy Director <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William J. Bennett</a>, crimes committed by males ages 14 to 17 will increase by 23 percent between 1995 and 2005. Because of the deterioration of family life, and also because of their easy access to guns, these juveniles are likely to commit more vicious crimes than their predecessors, targeting strangers as well as known enemies.<sup>5</sup>  Louis Freeh, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, believes that continuation of current trends in juvenile crime "portends future crime and violence at nearly unprecedented levels."<sup>6</sup>  Recent reports of juvenile crime dropping are of little comfort in light of the coming demographic surge of juveniles in their crime-prone years from dysfunctional families.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Growing numbers of young people, often from broken homes or so-called dysfunctional families, are committing murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping, and other violent acts. As John DiIulio and others argue, these emotionally damaged young people, growing up without faith, fathers, or families, often are the products of sexual or physical abuse. They live in an aimless and violent present; have no sense of the past and no hope for the future; and act, often ruthlessly, to gratify whatever urges or desires drive them at the moment. They commit unspeakably brutal crimes against other people, and their lack of remorse is shocking. They are what Professor DiIulio and others call urban "superpredators."  They are the ultimate urban nightmare, and their numbers are growing. The number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has increased nearly 60 percent over the last ten years:<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<ul>
<li>From 1985 to 1993, the number of murder cases involving 15-year-old juveniles increased 207 percent. Arrests of 18-year-old to 20-year-old males for murder over the same period increased 119 percent.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1988 to 1992, the number of juveniles involved in aggravated assaults increased 80 percent to 77,900; the number involved in robberies went up 52 percent to 32,900; and the number involved in rapes rose 27 percent to 5,400. Overall, juvenile court cases increased 26 percent.<sup>10</sup>  If trends of the past ten years continue, arrests of juveniles for violent crimes will double by the year 2010.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1989 to 1993, transfers of juveniles to adult court because of delinquency increased 41 percent to 11,800 cases; for crimes against persons, the number of transfers increased 115 percent to 5,000 cases.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<li>Of 1,471,200 juvenile court cases in 1992, personal offenses were up 56 percent to 301,000; property offenses were up 56 percent to 842,000; and public order offenses were up 21 percent to 255,900.<sup>13</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Young Victims.</b> Young people ages 12 to 17 are the most frequent victims of violent crime. They are raped, robbed, or assaulted at five times the rate of adults 35 years old or older. In 1992, one juvenile in 13 was the victim of violent crime -- up 23 percent from 1987.<sup>14</sup>  Also in 1992, 23 percent of the victims of the 6.6 million violent crimes committed in the United States were juveniles; the juvenile victimization rate was 74.2 cases per 1,000 juveniles, compared to 13.9 cases per 1,000 adults 35 years old or older.<sup>15</sup>  Overall, the sad fact is that
<p>
<blockquote>
	Crime has seriously affected teenagers' lives, especially those who live in neighborhoods seriously hurt by crime, drugs and gangs. The effects are insidious and long-standing. Teenagers protect themselves by carrying weapons, skipping school, changing their routes to and from classes, changing friends or letting their grades slip. For many young Americans, the carefree days of adolescence are a nostalgic fantasy.<sup>16</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even more shocking than the sheer volume of violent juvenile crime is the brutality of the crime committed for trivial motives: a pair of sneakers, a jacket, a real or imagined insult, a momentary cheap thrill. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A 59-year-old man out on a morning stroll in Lake Tahoe was fatally shot four times by teenagers "looking for someone to scare."  The police say the four teenagers -- just 15 and 16 years old -- were "thrill shooting."
<p>
<li> A 12-year-old and two other youths were charged with kidnapping a 57-year-old man and taking a joy ride in his Toyota. As the man pleaded for his life, the juveniles shot him to death.
<p>
<li> A 14-year-old boy was murdered while trying to reclaim a $2,500 stereo system he had received from his grandfather. Five juveniles, ranging in age from 15 through 17 years, were charged with the crime.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Seasoned big-city homicide detectives have a hard time coming to grips with the horror of these kinds of cases: The crimes are senseless, the motives banal, and the perpetrators all so young. These shocking incidents -- which occur in America's suburbs as well as its inner cities -- are creating a growing consensus among the American people: They have had enough. Lenient sentencing based strictly on age is no longer acceptable for crimes of this magnitude.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Loss of Public Confidence.</b> Polls show that Americans are unhappy with the system as it is: 49 percent believe rehabilitation programs for juveniles are not successful, 52 percent believe the punishments juveniles receive should be the same as those given adults, and 83 percent think juveniles who commit two or more crimes should receive the same sentencing as adults.<sup>18</sup>  A 1995 Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans also advocate the death penalty for juveniles who commit murder, as opposed to 24 percent in 1957.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Teenagers themselves take a hard stance on how their peers should be treated if they commit violent crimes. Over 93 percent believe that those accused of murder or rape should be tried as adults. Moreover, they do not believe these offenders should receive special consideration because of their age.<sup>20</sup>  This is consistent with broad public, judicial, and law enforcement sentiment, which generally has favored holding juveniles more accountable for their criminal actions in recent years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The juvenile justice system that prevails in many states today does juvenile criminals no favors by being lenient. According to a 1985 Rand Corporation study, "[w]aiting for chronic offenders to build a record of many arrests and minor dispositions only compounds the problems that must be dealt with later."<sup>21</sup>
<p>
<b>WHY TODAY'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS FAILING</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1899, when Illinois adopted the first Juvenile Court Act, America's juvenile courts have been unable to deal effectively with the violent juvenile criminal. Law enforcement officers and a growing number of private citizens realize that this continuing failure undermines the credibility of the whole juvenile justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The ultimate price for this failure, of course, is paid by innocent citizens. For example, only hours after returning home from a special school program in Costa Rica, Cindy Del Carmen Villalba, an honor student at Rutgers University, was killed in a botched robbery attempt. Corie Miller, age 17, and two accomplices were charged in her death. Miller had been eluding police for about a week when the slaying occurred. He had fled a Paterson, New Jersey, "get-tough" rehabilitation program that was supposed to be a "last ditch effort to reform him."  In the case of this habitual juvenile offender, it took the murder of a young, intelligent girl with a bright future to force the justice system to take a second look and finally adopt a tougher stance.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Failure to Target Serious Habitual Offenders.</b> In many states, the greatest single weakness of the effort to combat juvenile crime is a simple failure to target the most dangerous young offenders. This weakness arises from a reluctance on the part of juvenile justice officials to admit that there is a point at which a delinquent youth becomes such a threat to the community that he or she must be held accountable and incarcerated. Under the current system, the seriously violent juvenile can become invisible by being mixed in with the general population of non-violent and non-habitual juvenile offenders. Overwhelmingly, most urban young people who get arrested for a crime get arrested only once; seldom are they a serious or long-term threat to the safety of other citizens. Put another way, not all juvenile delinquents are alike, and very few are serious habitual offenders. The official failure to discriminate between minor offenders and hard-core criminal youth undermines the effectiveness of the entire system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most active juvenile delinquents also are the most dangerous. Often invisible to the officials who preside over the system, they are painfully visible to the victims they assault, rob, and kill. Official failure to develop credible control measures to suppress habitual juvenile offenders also sows the seeds of racial prejudice. With the rise of juvenile crime, an increasingly angry and insecure public tends to look upon all juveniles, particularly black male teenagers, as threats to the community. Most juvenile offenders, however, are not: 58 percent of young black males never have any contact with the police; and of the other 42 percent, an overwhelming majority do not go on to become SHOs.<sup>23</sup>  It is therefore vital that state and local officials, as well as taxpayers, begin to think and act differently toward the occasional juvenile delinquent. The SHO, on the other hand, is a career criminal in the making.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Information Gap.</b> Chronic offenders usually can be identified solely on the basis of their juvenile records. This evidence, however, normally does not accumulate until after the youth's 16th birthday. If additional factors describing the youth's school performance and home situation are included, the age at which youthful chronic offenders can be identified and an intervention mounted may be moved up several years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In reality, these young criminals are shunted in and out of state and local agencies by bureaucrats who are supposed to be running the system but who often seem to lack a collective awareness of the kind of young people they are processing. Too often, they are oblivious to the repeated and increasingly serious nature of the behavior of these young criminals. This official failure to share information can occur for many reasons: because it is not required by state law, because of bureaucratic inertia or lack of imagination, or even because of simple negligence. It is a key weakness in the current system. Most of the juvenile codes in the United States contain statutory language indicating that the juvenile judge should consider police reports; field interview reports; citations; social history information (such as data on school, family, and work); drug involvement information; motor vehicle operation information; associates' history; offense digests; victim accounts; and other relevant information, including medical and juvenile victimization data. Only rarely, however, is this information used or shared among youth service agencies; it often is not even made available to the presiding judge.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Declining Police Morale.</b> The continuing failure of the juvenile justice system in many states contributes to defeatism and low morale among local police. Police officers frequently do not treat juvenile crime the same as they treat crime committed by adults. Since no one else in the criminal justice system seems to be serious about punishing juvenile criminals, police officers often feel they will be wasting their time if they pursue these cases with the same zeal they display in pursuing adult criminals. They have learned from painful and frustrating personal experience that spending street time trying to suppress juvenile crime by arrests is futile; nothing will be done to the young criminals, who will just be allowed back out on the streets.<sup>24</sup>  As a result, many patrol officers shift juvenile crime problems to the local department's juvenile unit, transferring both the problem and the responsibility to a specialized unit that already is overloaded.
<p>
<b>WHY STATES AND LOCALITIES SHOULD ADOPT SHOCAP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The SHOCAP system has been employed successfully in over 150 communities in the United States and Canada, including Oxnard, California; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Tallahassee, Florida; Prince William County, Virginia; and Tampa, Florida (Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office). SHOCAP works in these communities because it provides accurate, documented support to police in tactical operations focused on their most active criminals. SHOCAP enables law enforcement officials to give direction to police in the field so that they can use their patrol activities to prevent and suppress the criminal activities of SHOs. Through computers and information sharing, SHOCAP provides field forces with comprehensive information on a SHO's criminal activities beyond beat or shift boundaries. The system works because a computerized case file -- either on-line in a police cruiser or accessible by police dispatchers -- can be punched up by the police within seconds.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps the most dramatic example of SHOCAP's effectiveness is Oxnard, California. Despite having one of the lowest police-to-population ratios in the country, over a three-year period in the 1980s, Oxnard experienced a 38 percent reduction in violent crime and a 60 percent drop in the murder rate. It did this by targeting and successfully incarcerating a greater number of SHOs than were targeted and incarcerated in jurisdictions not using SHOCAP. Recognizing that most crime is committed by a small minority of felons, Oxnard officials used SHOCAP to remove 30 of these hard-core juvenile offenders from the streets.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But SHOCAP is more than an effective short-term anti-crime program; it also has longer term preventive effects when employed consistently by local police officials and social service agencies. SHOCAP has received several evaluations in both the United States and Canada. Since 1983, for example, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has evaluated the program three times. The first evaluation process lasted from May 1, 1983, until July 1, 1986, and served as the basis for later implementation of the program. Additional studies began on January 1, 1985. These evaluations indicated that most project cities which remained in the program exceeded their expectations and reduced crime rates in neighborhoods from which SHOs were removed. The Canadian government's 1993-1994 evaluation of the Calgary SHOCAP program led the Solicitor General of Canada to recommend that SHOCAP be considered by other Canadian jurisdictions.<sup>26</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW TO IDENTIFY SERIOUS HABITUAL OFFENDERS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In every community, there is the potential for only 2 percent of the juvenile offender population to be responsible for up to 60 percent of the violent juvenile crime.<sup>27</sup>  These serious repeat offenders, who all too often eventually become adult career criminals, bleed the life from the community, endangering public safety and undermining economic stability.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In general, only 25 to 35 juveniles in every 100,000 members of the population will engage in criminal activity that matches the Serious Habitual Offender pattern. Based on criteria developed by the Reagan team at the Department of Justice, this means that 0.03 percent to 0.04 percent of all juveniles between 14 and 17 years old will be SHOs. At the same time, for each SHO, four other juveniles are at risk of becoming SHOs themselves.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Profile of a SHO.</b> Data collected and analyzed by the Reagan Administration team at the U.S. Department of Justice in the 1980s presents a graphic portrait of the serious habitual offender. The typical SHO is male, 15 years and six months old. He has been arrested 11 to 14 times, exclusive of status offenses, and five times for felonies. He comes from a dysfunctional family; and in 46 percent of cases, at least one of his parents also has an arrest history. He has received long-term and continuing social services from as many as six different community service agencies, including family, youth, mental health, social services, school, juvenile, or police authorities,<sup>29</sup> and continues to drain these resources for years before he is finally incarcerated as a career criminal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The typical SHO's family history follows a classic pattern of social pathologies: 53 percent of his siblings also have a history of arrest; and in 59 percent of these cases, there is no father figure in the home. The absence of a father is particularly destructive for boys; only 2 percent of SHOs are female. Furthermore, 68 percent of these offenders have committed crimes of violence, 15 percent have a history of committing sex crimes, and 51 percent have a reported missing or runaway record. If a broken family characterized by physical or sexual abuse is an early indicator of criminal behavior, then virtually all of these serious habitual offenders fit this category. Not surprisingly, these findings are consistent with the Heritage Foundation's widely reported analysis of the true root causes of violent crime, particularly the crimogenic conditions associated with broken or dysfunctional families.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, SHOs do not consider the crimes they have committed to be all that bad.<sup>31</sup>  Forty-five percent are gang members, 64 percent associate with other serious habitual offenders, and 75 percent abuse drugs. School, social, and employment experiences are not good experiences for SHOs,<sup>32</sup> who invariably have no moral compass. The SHO seems to feel that, no matter what he does, the system barely notices. The effect inevitably is to reinforce his criminal inclinations; when released from a state prison, for example, one in 30 of these offenders probably will commit murder.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Recent empirical evidence shows that illegal drug use among the young is on the rise.<sup>34</sup>  It is worth noting, therefore, that a significant majority of all SHOs use or sell illegal drugs and often become addicted themselves. Illegal drug use and alcohol abuse tend to be regular features of their criminal conduct. Drugs, in particular, are part of the criminal scene of these juvenile offenders, and the use and sale of drugs contributes significantly to a SHO's other criminal activity. The need to purchase illegal drugs, combined with the warped hedonism of the addict, shapes and drives much of the criminal activity of this class of criminals.
<p>
<b>HOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN DEAL WITH SERIOUS HABITUAL OFFENDERS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Following a step-by-step process, a community can set up an interagency council to coordinate efforts by the police and other local government and social service agencies to collect and analyze the essential data on SHOs, train police and local government staff in the use of information technology, and establish a strategy for dealing with these offenders that includes referrals to social service agencies for use in a judge's decision to incarcerate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program, essentially a comprehensive information and case management process, is directed by the police department's crime analysis unit. Information is collected from and shared with prosecutors, schools, probation officials, judges, correctional departments, and social service and welfare agencies. When community leaders initiate this process, however, they must remember their target: The purpose of SHOCAP is not to curb public nuisances, disorderly conduct among teenagers, or general property crime, but to identify, isolate, and control a very small group of serious habitual juvenile offenders -- only about 35 per 100,000 in the general population. Through SHOCAP, the community can concentrate its law enforcement and criminal justice resources on apprehending and incarcerating these juveniles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

SHOCAP also can lay the groundwork for appropriate intervention by public or private social service or welfare agencies participating in the program. As Professor DiIulio and others argue, the best weapon against violent crime is one that stops juveniles who are at risk of becoming career criminals in the first place. With early, targeted intervention by dedicated local community organizations -- especially religious or faith-based institutions with a social service capacity -- such children can be taught to tell right from wrong, can acquire personal discipline and moral virtues, and can learn to respect both themselves and others.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certain conditions are essential to the success of any local SHOCAP program:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>CONDITION #1: Establish the local police as the lead agency in tracking serious habitual offenders.</b> The police department is the logical lead agency in a SHOCAP program. Police officers have the first contact with criminals in the community. Police work is a 24-hour, 365-day-a-year job that involves the front-line responsibility and experience needed to handle criminal information. The police therefore have the ability to gather, organize, and analyze a SHO case file; they are familiar with SHOs and their case histories, as well as the kinds of crimes they commit and how they operate. On patrol in the neighborhoods, they will know where SHOs live and who their associates are, as well as their family and criminal histories.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Functional crime analysis by police is essential to SHOCAP, but local officials in each case will have to review the capacity of their own police agency to function as primary collector and analyzer of the basic SHOCAP information. This capacity varies from department to department; only two-thirds of all local police departments use computers, but many have a separate crime analysis unit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With regard to the police department's role, a cautionary note is in order: SHOCAP must be a department-wide responsibility. Placing the responsibility, particularly for data collection and analysis, with the juvenile division sends the signal that this unit can take care of the problem, and the rest of the police force need not concern itself with this juvenile project. Such an approach cuts off the agency's most important tactical muscle -- the cop on patrol in the neighborhood.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>CONDITION #2: Require local government agencies to share information on serious habitual offenders.</b> The adoption of a Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program is predicated on gathering and analyzing data, and then planning an appropriate response to SHOs. The SHOCAP process improves operational coordination among the police, prosecutors, courts, probation departments, schools, correctional agencies, social and family services, and other public and private community organizations. Computerized case management procedures for tracking serious habitual juvenile offenders allow the police to identify the warning signs of potential SHOs, such as a home characterized by domestic violence or sexual and physical abuse. Then, using the information gleaned from these routine police reports, local officials can assign responsibility for intervention or monitoring to public or private social service agencies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is why it is essential that welfare agencies and schools be included in the information gathering process. The families of serious habitual offenders often receive various types of public assistance.<sup>35</sup>  At the state and local levels, where many of these welfare programs are administered, social service workers who know the welfare histories and family structures of potential and active SHOs can provide important information on child abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the 1996 federal welfare reform, which includes block granting of welfare assistance and responsibilities to the states, cooperation among state welfare or social service agencies should improve significantly. Vital child victim and abuse information collected by social service agents in the course of their routine duties can give particular direction to law enforcement, probation, court, and corrections officers. Public housing authorities or managers also have tremendous potential to assist law enforcement officers in developing a database of serious habitual offenders. A juvenile growing up in public housing is four to five times more likely to become a SHO than is a juvenile growing up in non-public housing.<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
School officials, especially administrators, also can play a significant role in monitoring SHOs because SHOs invariably disrupt the classroom and are poor candidates for continuing in public school.<sup>37</sup>  School officials get to know who the serious habitual offenders are because of the pressures of trying to maintain order and discipline in the classroom, and usually have to spend more time monitoring them than they do with other students. Under certain circumstances, specialized schools designed to handle disruptive students should be an integral part of the intervention plan for these juveniles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the 1980s, juvenile justice files and crime, school, welfare, social service, and probation records rarely were shared between agencies. State and local officials, misconstruing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA),<sup>38</sup> frequently overreacted by withholding even basic "juvenile information."  Law enforcement and other agencies strained to keep secret common street information regarding a juvenile's conduct or the receipt of social services or welfare benefits. Before SHOCAP was implemented, juvenile judges and prosecutors in current SHOCAP jurisdictions often had access to less than 30 percent of the information needed for filings or court dispositions. In places like Colorado Springs and Oxnard, for example, there was little, if any, sharing of information between agencies. Where SHOCAP has been implemented, however, there has been remarkable progress in breaking down barriers to the gathering of appropriate information on juvenile criminal conduct. A new consensus has been emerging, both on sharing juvenile records and on what information within these records ought to be considered relevant.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A SHOCAP case file should include the following types of information: biographical data; a description of prior and current offenses, including criminal history; a listing of known and suspected associates and confederates; any gang or drug involvement; a description of any "fencing" activity; a concise, comprehensive narrative portrait; field investigation data (FI cards); motor vehicle ownership and violation information; whether the subject has been named as a suspect in other crimes; victimization history; the status offense history of the victim as well as the SHO; any active warrants; school, employment, and family histories; social and medical services history; and prior conduct in detention and correctional facilities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some states, however, may need to enact SHOCAP enabling legislation, which allows the sharing of juvenile records and information before SHOCAP can be established.<sup>39</sup>  Such legislation helps establish working relationships among law enforcement and local government agencies so they can build an effective database and case management system. To date, seven states have adopted or are working on SHOCAP enabling legislation.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Condition #3: Establish local criteria for identifying serious habitual offenders.</b> Each local jurisdiction must tailor its SHO criteria to fit its own crime problems, keeping in mind the capacity of its own law enforcement agencies. The criteria for identifying and tracking juvenile crime should focus on the worst juvenile offenders -- those who repeatedly have displayed serious criminal misconduct. Local officials must resist the temptation to broaden the net to include less serious offenders. Without this discipline, the program's focus will be lost, and the system will be swamped with marginal threats to community safety.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Based on the experience of local SHOCAP sites and an analysis conducted by Justice Department officials during the Reagan Administration, the following criteria conform to the case histories of the 35 most serious juvenile offenders per 100,000:<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Five arrests, with three chargeable as felonies, and three arrests within the last 12 months; or
<p>
<li> Ten arrests, with two chargeable as felonies, and three arrests within the last 12 months; or
<p>
<li> One arrest for three or more burglaries, robberies, or sexual assaults within the preceding 12 months; or
<p>
<li> Ten total arrests, with eight or more for misdemeanor crimes of theft, assault, battery, narcotics, or controlled substance abuse, or for possession of weapons, and three arrests within the preceding 12 months.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By using such criteria, local officials can estimate the caseload for all components of the criminal justice system, including the arrest, detention, and prosecution of serious habitual offenders and the extent of supervision to be provided by corrections officers after a SHO is released from prison. On the basis of this projected caseload, local officials also can inventory the resources available to concentrate on these juveniles (including both public and private social service agencies desiring to participate in the prevention aspects of the SHOCAP program) and allocate those resources accordingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Condition #4: Require that information on serious habitual offenders be shared with the courts and their officers.</b> In court proceedings, as well as in probation and parole hearings, the comprehensive case management files developed through SHOCAP can be invaluable. Juvenile judges can be assured that whatever judicial decisions they make are based on the best information available. The same is true for judges in adult criminal courts who have access to such files.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similarly, prosecutors will have the sort of comprehensive information they need to prosecute serious habitual offenders successfully. In fact, once a jurisdiction's SHOCAP program matures, and depending on caseload, the local prosecutor's office should consider creating a specific case management position, both to manage these cases more efficiently and to support vertical prosecution of SHOs.<sup>42</sup>  In addition, SHOCAP gives prosecutors a ready-made case priority and assignment schedule. A complete SHOCAP file ensures that SHOs are charged with the highest legally provable offense, prevents the inappropriate pretrial release of such offenders, and prevents the sealing or destroying of the records of juveniles designated as SHOs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Juvenile probation officers will find that the case file preparation generated by the SHOCAP process can lessen their casework and fortify their recommendations to the courts on the disposition of juvenile cases. They can develop specialized individual programs and custody levels for such offenders, making a sharp distinction between SHOs and other juvenile delinquents. The most important task is to develop specialized control measures for the SHO on probation or back on the streets after release from prison.

<p>
<b>CUTTING SHORT A CRIMINAL CAREER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For law-abiding citizens, the career criminal is Public Enemy Number One. By using modern information technology and case management as embodied in Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Programs, law enforcement officers and local government officials can target and track society's most dangerous criminals. Almost without exception, the adult career criminal was a serious habitual offender as a juvenile. Once again, this is a very small minority of the population: 94 percent of the juveniles arrested for a criminal offense are never arrested again, 4 percent are arrested on a regular basis, and only 2 percent are arrested repeatedly and go on to become serious habitual offenders and career criminals.<sup>43</sup>  Career criminals exhibit common patterns of behavior, as well as a relationship between age and criminal behavior. Unfortunately, however, today's juvenile justice and adult criminal justice systems are not adequately linked.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since both the volume and intensity of juvenile crime have increased and are likely to escalate in the future, it is no longer feasible to wait until these career criminals reach adulthood to protect society from their actions.<sup>45</sup>  There are stages in the life of the typical career criminal.<sup>46</sup>  By channeling resources on the basis of a comprehensive case management system, SHOCAP can play a crucial role in stifling a criminal career at each stage. State and local officials therefore should adopt a SHOCAP program and try some juvenile offenders 18 years old and under as adults.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Stages of Development.</b> In the first stage of criminal development, as amply documented by <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, these serious habitual offenders come from abusive, broken, or neglectful homes.<sup>47</sup>  Looking backward through the SHOCAP telescope, local law enforcement and criminal justice officials can trace the pattern of abuse and neglect that often results in a delinquent and criminal lifestyle. Based on the SHOCAP criteria and amplified by indices of negative social conditions identified by the Heritage Foundation, state and local officials can design an early intervention strategy for juveniles who are at risk of becoming serious habitual offenders and career criminals. Such a strategy can focus community resources, including private-sector charitable, social, and religious institutions, on potential and active SHOs and stop their criminal careers before they gain momentum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the second stage of the criminal's development, from 13 to 18 years of age, the SHOCAP process helps judges and other state and local criminal justice officials answer a critical question: Is the offender, based on his record, likely to respond to intensive intervention by social service agencies, or is he in fact a youthful career criminal who cannot be rehabilitated and should be locked up?  State corrections officials simply do not know how to rehabilitate some violent young criminals who pose such a clear danger to society that they must be separated from the community and controlled. SHOCAP can help state and local judges and other responsible officials determine who among a larger class of young offenders are the incorrigibles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From the vantage point of public safety, the best that state and local officials can do with the incorrigible juvenile SHO when the crime is serious is to try him as an adult, sentence him as an adult, and require him to serve at least 85 percent of his sentence, as specified by the truth-in-sentencing laws called for in recent federal legislation and enacted in 22 states.<sup>48</sup>  This would mean that a 15-year-old serious habitual offender who is given 20 years for second degree murder would serve at least 17 years before being released at age 32. Thus, the serious offender would have spent his highest crime years locked up, unable to prey on more victims.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the third stage of a criminal's career, from 18 to 30 years of age, SHOCAP gives state and local criminal justice officials complete criminal histories of career offenders at the time they are arrested. The police, prosecutors, and judges know instantly that they are dealing with a SHO and not a petty or first time offender. Currently, however, an adult criminal's previous juvenile records are not available to the system in most jurisdictions. As a result, 18-year-olds with lengthy records of serious and violent crime frequently are treated as first-time offenders.
<p>
<b>A NEW POLICY TO COMBAT VIOLENT JUVENILE CRIME</b>

America's juvenile and criminal justice system still works too slowly to be effective in identifying and incarcerating career criminals. Congress can assist state and local officials with money, technology, and advice -- and by removing federal mandates in the juvenile judicial system -- but controlling and combating serious crime remains the responsibility primarily of state and local government. State and local leaders can take a variety of concrete steps to combat the scourge of violent crime, especially crimes committed by juveniles. Innovative police methods like those implemented in cities like Houston and New York are reducing the rate of violent crime.<sup>49</sup>  Beyond adopting an information management system like SHOCAP, state and local leaders can take three other steps to stop these criminal careers before they run their destructive course:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Target and track serious habitual offenders.</b> Enact legislation at the state level that enables local officials to share crucial juvenile case files and establish an effective Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program in their local jurisdictions. SHOCAP can make available to police and state law enforcement officers, as well as judicial and corrections officials, the information they need to identify and respond to the most dangerous young criminals in their communities.
<p>
<li><b>  Try as adults all juveniles who commit heinous crimes.</b> Enact state laws to try juvenile offenders as adults for specific violent offenses. Under Title I of Representative McCollum's Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996, a juvenile criminal 14 or more years of age who is convicted of a serious federal violent crime or "a major drug trafficking offense" automatically can be tried as an adult. States should consider similar legislation for state offenses.
<p>
<li><b> Enact truth-in-sentencing laws.</b> Pass legislation requiring all violent offenders, including juveniles tried as adults, to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.<sup>50</sup>  Thus far, 22 states have adopted such laws. As the bipartisan Council on Crime in America has concluded, probation, parole, and other forms of non-incarceration often take the place of prison, even for violent offenders. More than half of convicted violent felons still are not sentenced to prison.<sup>51</sup>  This must end.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress can encourage state and local officials in their efforts to combat juvenile crime. The Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act of 1996 sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch and former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole would allow states to try the most serious violent juvenile offenders (those charged with federal offenses) as adults. In many respects, this bill complements the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 sponsored by Representative McCollum. Both bills also give financial assistance to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Ultimately, however, the war to defeat the growing menace of violent juvenile crime must be fought and won by state and local officials who are smart, tough, and tenacious. The SHOCAP process is a valuable weapon for communities fighting the war on crime. It combines the advances of the modern microelectronic revolution with sophisticated crime and data analysis to target and track America's most crucial crime perpetrator: the violent habitual juvenile offender.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By providing instant access to shared information and a complete case file with relevant information, SHOCAP not only will improve the capability of the local police, but also will enhance the quality and caliber of decisions made by key officials in the criminal justice system. Courts, probation and parole departments, correctional officials, and social service and welfare agencies all will benefit from a strong database on juvenile offenders and from shared access to case management files.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Today's serious habitual offenders are tomorrow's career criminals. Children who look more like victims of abuse and neglect than criminals at age 13 may well be engaged in repeatedly committing the community's most serious and violent offenses from ages 14 to 17. They are a serious and growing threat to public safety. Fortunately, if adopted, SHOCAP and the other reforms advocated in this paper can help America's communities make their streets, schools, and neighborhoods safe again.

<P>
<CENTER><I>Jeffrey L. Taylor, Executive Director,

<BR>
</FONT></I></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">National Press Club:  Thank you, Chairman Devine.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">I want to begin my remarks today with a short
story about something that happened to me recently.  Two nights
ago, I was interviewed on CNBC about my organization's efforts
to reduce wiretapping.  In the middle of the interview, the host
took a call from a clear conservative.  Her remark was simple
and to the point -- and the usual remark all conservatives get
from liberals.  &quot;If you are for reducing wiretapping, then
you must be for terrorism.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Conservatives get nailed with that broad brush
every day when it comes to the environment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE=""> We are for reforming the Clean Air Act --
therefore we are for dirty air.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE=""> We are for reforming the Clean Water Act --
therefore we are for dirty water.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE=""> We are for reform of the Endangered Species
Act -- therefore, we hate wildlife.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U><I><B><FONT FACE="">Of course, nothing could be farther
from the truth.<BR>
</FONT></B></I></U>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Conservatives see people as a part of nature.
 Liberals see people as the enemy of nature.  Environmental policies
over the past several decades, while the Democrats have been in
charge of Congress, have illustrated just that view.  In that
time, we have seen more regulations, more government control over
federal lands and private property, higher taxes, and lower involvement
of the private sector.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Today, if you strike oil on your land, the
value of your property goes up.  However, if you find an endangered
species on your land, your property value plummets.  When your
land value goes down, you and your family are at risk.  This creates
a threat to both people and wildlife.  Is the safety of the golden
cheeked warbler more important that your family's well-being?
 Liberals say yes.  Under conservative proposals, the question
need not be asked or answered.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">This platform calls for tax incentives to protect
species, preserve your property, and enhance the environment.
 The value of your property will rise and the antagonistic relationship
between land owners and wildlife will end.  This platform defines
excessive regulation of property as a &quot;taking&quot; under
the 5th Amendment.  Land owners must be compensated when their
land is abused by the federal government.  Today, there is no
financial constraint on federal agencies, such as the Fish and
Wildlife Service, from over regulating your property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">If there were a dollar amount attached to every
action that the federal government takes in dealing with private
property, less property will be taken and the government would
need more solid evidence before taking property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">This platform reduces regulation, puts a better
balance on economic factors, demands more scientific accountability,
keeps our environment, wildlife, and natural resources healthy
and protected, and protects property rights.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">All Americans want to have a cleaner, healthier,
safer environment. The question is how to reach those goals. We
believe that outdated programs such as Superfund, the Clean Water,
Clean Air and Endangered Species Acts must be reformed so that
the well being of human beings is considered the ultimate measure,
responsible scientific standards are incorporated, solutions are
developed at a site- and situation-specific level rather than
by bureaucratic mandate, market mechanisms are employed to reach
goals, and private property try rights are protected. Using all
of these tools improves the environment while protecting rights
and allowing for economic progress. To do so effectively, we must
use scientifically rigorous risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis
for all regulatory activities. Superfund is a colossally expensive
example of what not to do. Billions have been spent in some cases
to make soil squeaky clean, while true toxic waste sites have
often remained untouched for years. We commend the Republican
Congress for passing true reform: the Unfunded Mandates Relief
Act, and the majority of Republicans who supported the Risk Assessment
and Cost Benefits Act, the Regulatory Reform and Relief Act, and
the Clean Water Amendments of 1995.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Most current government policies have been
based on an outdated, bureaucratic, command-and-control model
of forcing compliance. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is a
prime example that has failed in its purpose and done great harm.
Rather than saving endangered species, the real fruits of this
law have been violation of property rights on a massive scale
and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars
of economic activity and land values. As a result, even the Democratic
Congress of President Clinton's first two years was unable to
re-authorize the Act (forcing it to operate only under appropriations
bills). Consequently, we support a new vision on how to conserve
species. We support a non-regulatory, incentive-based system that
rewards property owners for good stewardship of wildlife habitat
and which will begin to re-establish trust between land owners,
communities and officials. We commend those members of Congress
who introduced a measure that meets these goals, the Endangered
Species Recovery and Conservation Incentive Act of 1995.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Over the past three decades, national regulations
of natural resource management and laws promulgated in the name
of the environment have asserted more and more control over how
citizens can use their property. We believe that excessive regulation
of property undermines its integrity and amounts to a &quot;taking&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment, without providing compensation for
the private loss. We recognize the great value of private property
in ensuring a healthy, productive and beautiful environment. Accordingly,
we support regulatory takings compensation for regulations that
effectively end use of property. We commend those members of the
House who voted to provide such protection in The Private Property
Protection Act of 1995 and those members of the Senate who supported
Senator Dole's Omnibus Property Rights Act.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Renewable resources-trees, plants, soil, air,
water, fish and wildlife and collections thereof such as wetlands,
deserts, forests and prairies-are the resources that produce food,
clothing, medicine, shelter and essential human needs.    Human
life depends upon them. In most cases, such resources are continually
regenerated and have a profound ability<B> </B>to carry, recycle,
recover and cleanse. These characteristics make it possible to
wisely use renewable resources and conserve them for future generations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Agriculture and energy are the building blocks
of modern life and remain vital to survival. Human ingenuity can
conserve, develop and improve resources through privatization
and the use of enterprise. We support the private nature of the
American farm system and the entrepreneurship of the American
farmer and rancher. We salute the Freedom to Farm legislation
passed by the Republican 104th Congress and encourage other responsible
movements toward a true market system. We likewise note that our
energy system, primarily private, made the American economic miracle
possible. We support elimination of the Department of Energy to
emphasize the need for greater privatization and deregulation.
We oppose efforts to nationalize under the Department the electric
utility industry and support its continued deregulation and privatization
under state regulatory policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">With large majorities of the land in the West
owned by the government, Democrat Party policies have severely
restricted natural resource production and even recreation activities
without improving the environmental quality of these lands. We
support responsible privatization of such lands, particularly
those under the Bureau of Land Management, while we support preserving
historic rights to water, mining claims, grazing permits, rights
of access, hunting and contracts. We oppose new additions to the
government's already large land stock through additions to national
forests, wildlife refuges and parks well beyond Federal ability
to manage them. We oppose the intrusive and destructive policies
of the Clinton Administration designed to halt timber production
in the most productive forests, force livestock off traditional
ranges, limit mineral and oil exploration and production, establish
an intrusive national biological survey, and restrict hunting.
We also oppose policies which conveyed decision-making over American
resources to international bodies such as the Convention on Climate
Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Montreal Protocol,
and the myriad United Nations UNESCO programs. We reject these
environmentally and economically disastrous policies. We instead
support our new and workable vision for ensuring that all Americans
have a healthier, cleaner and safer environment.</FONT>

<I><DD>With President Clinton's signing of welfare reform legislation, almost everyone now agrees that the 
welfare state has been a failure.  Government welfare programs, rather than providing a temporary safety net for those who have fallen on hard times, have too often become a long-term snare that discourages self-sufficiency. But what will replace the welfare state?
<BR>
<DD>Proponents of the status quo often say that viable private alternatives to government welfare do not exist or cannot be created.  Yet such alternatives flourished in the past, and some still flourish today.  They need to receive greater public attention and, more importantly, they need to be duplicated.
<BR>
<DD>The four books reviewed in this month's </I>Alternatives in Philanthropy<I> explore some of these alternatives and suggest changes that can be made in public policy to help restore private charity to its once indispensable role. Together, they offer a compelling vision of a post-welfare society.</I><BR>

<P>
<DD>For years, the debate over welfare reform has 
centered around money.  Liberals have contended that the 
problems of the poor can be solved by spending more tax dollars. 
 Most of this money, of course, has ended up in the hands 
of middle-class professionals who deal with the 
poorsociologists, nonprofit executives, and social workers.  
And because the number of poor people has not fallen even 
as government spending on poverty programs has 
increased, liberals have called for even more tax funding of 
nonprofit organizations that ostensibly serve the poor.
<BR>
<DD>The standard conservative response has been to call 
for cuts in welfare.  Cut payments and impose time limits 
on benefits, conservatives have argued, and the poor 
will struggle in low-wage jobs and gradually move up 
the income ladder as earlier generations did.
<BR>
<DD>This view is not without merit.  In the late 1980s, 
the American Enterprise Institute's Michael Novak convened 
a team of policy analysts, both liberal and conservative, 
to see if they could reach a consensus on how to 
reduce poverty.  They concluded that in order to avoid 
long-term poverty, a person must do three things: finish high 
school, get married, and get a job -- any job.  (See 
<I>The New Consensus on Poverty and Welfare</I>, Washington, DC: AEI, 1987.) 
 Even the lowest-paying jobs teach important skills such 
as punctuality and courtesy that are essential in all kinds 
of work.
<BR>
<DD>Against the liberal argument, it can also be said that 
the poor, like everyone else, respond to incentives.  In 
large cities, the homeless often receive many kinds of 
benefits, from shelter to food to medicine to evenin a few 
&quot;progressive&quot; citieselectronic mail addresses.  Of course, 
this does nothing to reduce homelessness.  In fact, many of 
the homeless seem to prefer life on the streets to the 
demands earning a living in mainstream society.

<DD>Marvin Olasky, whose 1992 book <I>The Tragedy of 
American Compassion</I> helped spark a renewed debate on 
how best to help the poor, seeks to change the focus of 
welfare discussions.  He argues that many of the problems the 
poor face are not financial but cultural and spiritual.  He 
contends that many 19th-century charities effectively 
fought poverty by helping the poor on an individual basis 
and through biblical and moral teaching.  <I>Renewing 
American Compassion: How Compassion for the Needy Can 
Turn Ordinary Citizens into Heroes</I> (New York: Free Press, 
201 pages, $21.00) continues Olasky's exploration of why 
private charity is a better way to help the poor than 
government subsidy.
<BR>
<DD>&quot;Private charities had succeeded in helping many 
individuals,&quot; Olasky writes, &quot;because they offered 
compassion that was challenging, personal, and spiritually based.  
Government over time proved itself incapable of doing 
the same; instead, governmental charity emphasized 
entitlement rather than challenge, bureaucracy rather than 
personal help, and a reduction of man to material being only.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>In the first chapter, Olasky examines recent efforts 
in Wisconsin to reform welfare by imposing work 
requirements and time limits on benefits.  While supporting 
some of these reforms, he argues that Wisconsin's reforms 
include &quot;a package of social-worker intensive programs 
that will continue to keep the welfare world safe for 
bureaucracy.&quot;  Moreover, the Wisconsin effort is essentially 
a compromise intended to please liberals, conservatives, 
and feminists.  Liberals under the reform get a continuation 
of the welfare state.  Conservatives get some insistence 
on work, as welfare recipients are required to get a job 
or spend 32 hours per week in classes to prepare them 
for work.  And feminists get an assurance that welfare 
agencies will not elevate the traditional family above other 
living arrangements.  On the walls of a Kenosha, 
Wisconsin welfare office are such slogans as &quot;A family
doesn’t need a man to be whole” and “Stop waiting for Prince Charming, his horse broke down.”
<BR>
<DD>While it’s too early to tell what results these reforms as well as recent federal legislation will produce, Olasky suggests that most reformers are asking the wrong questions.  Perhaps current reforms will prompt some mothers to enter the work force, but will government programs ensure that poor women don’t form single-parent households in the first place?  “Long-term poverty fighting,” he contends, “depends on affecting not just the outside of a person, but the inside as well.”
<BR>
<DD>In the second chapter, Olasky explores several faith-based private alternatives to Wisconsin’s reform efforts.  In Milwaukee’s Parklawn housing project, Deborah Darden heads the Right Alternative Family Services Center, which teaches responsibility to welfare mothers and their children.  He also visits Milwaukee’s Professional Receptionist Institute, where Lessie Handy teaches poor women how to get jobs as receptionists.  According to Handy, her school has had 206 graduates in its short existence, 186 of whom currently have jobs.
<BR>
<DD>These charities, Olasky contends, do a better job with less money than their state-run counterparts because they teach moral lessons as well as job skills.  “No bureaucracy, and no amount of money, can buy the reformation of morals that is desperately needed.”
<P>
<B>Lessons from History</B><BR>
<DD>In subsequent chapters, Olasky returns to history to discuss principles that charity workers and organizations used to help the poor.  New York City’s Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children (founded 1797) provided food, clothing, and medicine—but no cash—to those it believed would be propelled toward greater self-sufficiency.  Other 19th-century charities admonished volunteers to follow such principles as: help the deserving poor one at a time, and treat them as friends and neighbors, not clients.  
Most 19th-century social reformers opposed
any massive national effort to address poverty.  An 
1844 edition of <I>McGuffey's Reader</I>, for example, criticized 
a &quot;Mr. Fantom&quot; who had &quot;noble zeal for the 
<I>millions</I>&quot; but &quot;little compassion for the units.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Around the turn of the century, however, these 
effective charities were superseded by large national 
organizations that thought it more important to fight the presumed 
&quot;social causes&quot; of poverty.  Progressive reformers replaced 
the reform-minded Christianity of their parents and 
grandparents with a weaker, utopian faith which held that a 
New Jerusalem could be built in America through 
government action.  As Frank Lovejoy, president of the National 
Conference of Social Work, said in a 1920 address, 
social workers could become &quot;social engineers&quot; who would 
create &quot;a divine order on earth as it is in heaven.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Ultimately, the ideas of Progressives led to the 
welfare programs of the Great Society.  But today, Olasky 
contends, the welfare state is like an abandoned church: its 
structure still stands, but the faith that built it is long dead.
<P>
<B>Moving Beyond the Status Quo</B>
<BR>
<DD>Olasky observes, however, that many smaller nonprofits, often with shoestring budgets, have adapted or retained the methods of 19th-century charities.  Reformers such as Bob Cote in Denver, Hannah Hawkins in Washington, D.C., and Freddie Garcia in San Antonio change lives through tough-love approaches.  As welfare agencies stagnate under the dead weight of disproved theories and political inertia, smaller, nimbler nonprofits are succeeding.
<BR>
<DD>Olasky argues that thousands of poverty-fighting groups will do more for the poor than a massive and costly welfare state.
To help them, he proposes greatly expanded tax credits for charitable activities.  He supports the proposals of Sen. Dan Coats (R-IN) that would give a $500 tax credit to taxpayers who contribute to direct-service charities, and an additional $500 credit to taxpayers who take care of homeless people, battered and pregnant women, or those requiring hospice care.
<BR>
<DD>But Olasky believes that more dramatic reforms 
are necessary.  He calls for devolving welfare to the states 
and reducing the average federal tax burden by $3,000 
per person.  To offset the loss of federal revenue, state 
taxes would rise by $2,500 per person.  However, those 
who contributed $3,000 in time or money to 
poverty-fighting organizations would be exempt from the new state tax.
<BR>
<DD>Tax credits, Olasky concludes, can play a part in 
ensuring that more Americans practice true compassion 
toward the needy.  But personal changes in the beliefs of 
millions of Americans will be necessary if poverty is to be reduced. 
 &quot;With supportive laws and rules,&quot; Olasky says, 
&quot;compassionate individuals can make real progress toward 
reducing some of our most serious social pathologies, but the 
crucial change is still the one that goes on in each individual 
soul, not in the federal or state capitals.&quot;

<I>Community without Politics</I></FONT><BR>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>Reviewed by Daniel T. Oliver<BR>
Editor</B></FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
<DD>Is there a viable private alternative to the welfare state? 
 This is the question posed by David G. Green, director 
of the Health and Welfare Unit of the Institute of 
Economic Affairs, in <I>Community without Politics: A Market 
Approach to Welfare Reform</I> (London: IEA, [2 Lord 
North Street, SW1p 3LB, tel: 0171-799-3745], 1996, 184 
pp., &#163;8.00).  Green, a leading expert on welfare in Great 
Britain, brings a much-needed classical liberal perspective to 
the issue of how to replace the welfare state.  Most of 
his analyses and recommendations are applicable to the 
United States.
<BR>
<DD>Before the welfare state, Green argues, most 
Britons assumed responsibility for fostering a &quot;public but not 
political domain&quot; of duties to care for those unable to 
support themselves.  They prioritized responsibility for this 
task: first, the individual or family; second, the community 
as distinct from the state; and finally, the government.  
This formed the basis for an ethos of &quot;community without 
politics&quot; in which ordinary people helped the less 
fortunate without generally resorting to government.  This 
ethos, argues Green, urgently needs to be revived.
<P>
<B>Liberty and Community: A Restatement</B>
<BR>
<DD>Green argues that the Thatcher and Reagan 
administrations failed to curtail government welfare because 
they could not change public beliefs that doing so would 
be harmful and immoral.  He contends that this attitude 
still predominates because few people can envision 
private alternatives to welfare and because &quot;collectivists 
have successfully established in the public mind . . . that 
to demand more government welfare . . . is proof of 
compassion.&quot;  Moreover, advocates of freedom have been 
preoccupied with economic issues while overlooking the 
importance of voluntary associations in addressing social 
problems.
<BR>
<DD>Green believes that fundamental welfare reform 
depends in part on reviving classical liberal conceptions of 
freedom and community.  These, he suggests, have important 
implications for both givers and receivers of charity.  To 
most 19th-century liberals, freedom was not &quot;laissez-faire&quot; 
or liberation from obstacles to one's desires, but the 
exercise of responsibility for self-improvement and for making 
the world a better place for others.  Historically, advocates 
of liberty &quot;wanted to create and foster institutions that 
would encourage self-improvement.  Civic capitalists always 
understood that life is a perpetual struggle against 
imperfection.  They did not, of course, expect perfection to 
be achieved.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Drawing on the work of political philosopher 
Michael Oakeshott, Green uses the term &quot;civil association&quot; to 
describe the kind of community classical liberals sought 
to build.  Advocates of civil association held that 
individuals were intelligent agents capable of overcoming 
obstacles and charting their course in life.  Freedom, while 
demanding much of the individual, was experienced as a 
pleasure, not a burden.  A sense of community arose from a 
shared understanding that everyone, through the exercise of 
responsibility and virtue, had both the chance to achieve 
his or her potential and a responsibility to help others 
achieve theirs.
<BR>
<DD>But Green notes that when the 20th-century welfare 
state tried to solve problems that all individuals 
facefrom saving for health care to guarding against poverty in 
old ageit undermined opportunities to address those 
problems individually and through voluntary associations: 
it &quot;weakened human character by diminishing 
opportunities for us to develop our skills and our virtues through 
direct participation in overcoming the hazards of life. . . .  
There can be no virtue without practice and no practice while 
the state monopolizes all important services.&quot;  If the 
welfare state is to be replaced, each of us must be willing to 
shoulder more responsibility for our own welfare and the welfare 
of others.
<P>
<B>Reforming the Nonprofit Sector</B><BR>
<DD>Green succinctly explains why the welfare state 
has encouraged long-term dependency and effectively 
refutes arguments often used to justify expansive welfare 
programs.  But his main contribution may be the many 
proposals he advances to scale back the welfare leviathan 
and allow private initiative to flourish.
<BR>
<DD>Recognizing that private alternatives to welfare will 
not become widespread so long as nonprofit organizations 
rely on government funds, Green suggests that the law 
recognize two types of nonprofits: &quot;registered charities&quot; 
that depend entirely on private funding and &quot;registered 
voluntary associations&quot; that receive partial funding from 
government.  Only the former would enjoy tax-exempt status.  
This change, Green believes, would encourage more 
nonprofits to forego government funding.
<BR>
<DD>Green also proposes that advocates of nonprofit 
reform create a membership organization to represent 
privately supported nonprofits.  Its goal would be to &quot;build a 
movement of those who take pride in ensuring that vital tasks 
are undertaken without resort to government . . . and to 
encourage the new spirit among others.&quot; Green further 
proposes that businesses reorient their giving programs to 
favor privately supported nonprofits and that they refuse to 
fund nonprofits that seek to expand the welfare state.
<P>
<B>Policy Proposals</B>
<BR>
<DD>Green outlines four policy changes that must occur if 
the poor are to become economically self-sufficient:
<UL>
<LI>Promote economic growth and end over-regulation that is responsible for unemployment.
<LI>Acknowledge that self-destructive behavior is a major cause of poverty.  Discretionary assistance is more likely to help the needy than cash payments and one-size-fits-all entitlement programs.
<LI>Cut income taxes to allow wage earners to keep more of their earnings, and end income taxes on savings.
<LI>Revive the tradition of community without politics.
</UL>
<BR>
<DD>Green discusses how voluntary organizations could do 
a better job of providing two types of government 
benefits: insurable contingencies (such as sick pay and 
disability benefits) and unemployment compensation.  To 
privatize insurable contingencies, the government would honor 
existing commitments but at a set date pay no new benefits. 
Reductions in spending would be matched by tax 
cuts, allowing workers to retain more of their earnings to 
buy health insurance or set aside money in case of ill health.
<BR>
<DD>Green proposes four ways to handle individuals 
with costly pre-existing health conditions:
<UL>
<LI>The government could pay insurance companies a one-time lump sum in exchange for accepting such persons
<LI>Risk pools, like those in use in the U.S., could be created;
<LI>Insurers could be required to accept a certain number of uninsurable persons based on market share;
<LI>Traditional provident dispensaries, similar to America's community health clinics, could be reestablished.  
The poor would pay what they could for health 
care while the better-off would pay more.  As Green notes, 
&quot;the British people have traditionally been generous and 
many may well be attracted to support provident associations. 
Today, organizations which have an ethical as well as 
a commercial purpose are already popular, including 
unit trusts [mutual funds] promising `ethical investments.'&quot;
</UL>
<DD>Green argues that Britain's current unemployment 
compensation system encourages an attitude of &quot;claim all 
you can get.&quot;  But private organizations, he contends, are 
better suited to develop tailor-made programs that help 
individuals regain employment: &quot;A face-to-face relationship with 
a voluntary association worker will not have the same 
corrupting effect because all assistance will be 
discretionary and subject to mutual agreement.  In such a 
personal relationship, mutual respect, honour and good faith have 
a chance, but an arms-length relationship with a public 
official encourages dishonesty, bad faith and `working 
the system.'&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Green proposes giving the unemployed the option of choosing either government unemployment benefits or 
assistance from privately funded employment organizations. 
Individuals choosing the former would have to spend 
all their savings and deduct any part-time income before 
receiving benefits.  Those choosing private support, 
however, would not be legally obliged to do either.
<P>
<B>Dealing with Illegitimacy</B><BR>
<DD>Green believes that &quot;to father a child and to refuse to 
take responsibility should be clearly marked out as one of 
the lowest things a man can do.&quot;  To deter men from 
fathering children out of wedlock, he proposes three new 
criminal offenses, possibly carrying jail sentences:
<UL>
<LI>A father's failure to register his child's birth;
<LI>Threatening the mother with violence to conceal the father's identity;
<LI>Failing to pay child support.
</UL>
<DD>Green proposes that fathers who refuse to pay 
child support be legally required to turn over all earnings, 
savings, and non-essential possessions until their obligation 
is fulfilled.  He also proposes that fathers who quit working 
to avoid child support be forced to work at special centers.  
&quot;It may be necessary in a few cases to make this work 
obligation especially burdensome, perhaps by requiring 
performance of hard labour for up to ten hours a day. . . .  
These measures will strike many as severe, and that is 
their intention.  They are likely to bring about a 
substantial behavioural change in men.&quot;
<P>Green also recommends that never-married mothers 
with children over two years of age be required to work as 
a condition of receiving benefits.  He speculates that the 
need for day care would make mandatory workfare more 
costly in the short run.  However, if &quot;the future promises a 
five-day working week plus caring for the child alone in the 
evenings and weekends, fewer [women] will choose it.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Road Ahead</B><BR>
<DD>Green aptly summarizes today's welfare problem 
by quoting J.S. Mill: &quot;A people among whom there is no 
habit of spontaneous action for a collective interestwho 
look habitually to their government to command or prompt 
them in all matters of joint concern who expect to have 
everything done for them, except what can be made an affair 
of mere habit and routinehave their faculties only 
half developed.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>The current welfare crisis, as Green amply makes 
clear, is not primarily financial but moral: welfare has 
undermined the determination of recipients to become 
self-sufficient and discouraged those who can help from doing so.
<BR>
<DD>As the 20th century draws to a close, more people 
are becoming convinced that the all-embracing welfare 
state cannot work.  Yet it is not sufficient to demolish the 
myth of the beneficent welfare state. <I>Community without 
Politics</I> outlines important steps that must be taken to 
make viable private alternatives to welfare a reality.
<BR>

book, <I>Reinventing Civil Society: The Rediscovery of

<I>To Empower People</I></FONT><BR>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>Reviewed by Daniel T. Oliver, Editor</B></FONT></CENTER><BR>
<P>
<DD>In 1977, the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) 
published a forty-five page pamphlet entitled <I>To 
Empower People</I>.  Its authors, sociologist Peter L. Berger 
(now director of the Institute for the Study of Economic 
Culture at Boston University) and Catholic theologian 
Richard John Neuhaus (president of the Institute on Religion 
and Public Life and editor-in-chief of its monthly journal, 
<I>First Things</I>), argued compellingly that &quot;mediating 
structures&quot;institutions such as neighborhoods, families, churches, 
and voluntary associationsserve as an important bridge 
between individuals' private lives and the larger 
institutions of society.  Mediating structures, they declared, are vital 
to maintaining social cohesion and preventing social 
breakdown.
<BR>
<DD>AEI has republished the original work along with 
eleven new essays by prominent observers of American civic 
life in <I>To Empower People: From State to Civil 
Society</I> (Washington, DC: The AEI Press, 1996, 223 pages, $24.95, 
tel: [202] 862-5800).  The essayists offer insight into how 
the ideas of Berger and Neuhaus have helped to shape 
thinking about public policy over the last 20 years and 
contemplate the future course of public policy.  The introductory 
essay by AEI scholar Michael Novak, winner of the 
1994 Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion and a member 
of Capital Research Center's National Advisory Board, 
offers this prediction: &quot;The political party that makes 
mediating structures the North Star of a new bipartisan agenda 
will dominate practical politics for the next fifty years.&quot;
<UL>
<LI>Douglas J. Besharov, resident scholar at AEI, suggests ways to generate funding for mediating institutions that do not rely on direct federal monies;
<LI>Stuart M. Butler, vice president for domestic and economic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, describes how public policy can encourage the growth of mediating structures;
<LI>William A. Galston, former deputy assistant to President Clinton for domestic policy, tells how &quot;New Democrats&quot; in the executive branch have sought to reinvigorate mediating structures;
<LI>David G. Green, director of the Health and Welfare Unit at the Institute of Economic Affairs, analyzes how the welfare state has undermined mediating institutions and suggests ways to address this problem;
<LI>Michael J. Horowitz, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former general counsel of the Office of Management and Budget, proposes legal reforms that can help restore the role of mediating structures;
<LI>Michael S. Joyce and William A. Schambra, president and director of general programs, respectively, of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, examine how the erosion of the Great Society ideal has laid the foundation for a revival of mediating structures;
<LI>Leslie Lenkowsky, president of the Hudson Institute, explains how federally funded nonprofits present a major obstacle to restoring mediating structures;
<LI>Marvin Olasky, senior fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation and author of the new book <I>Renewing American Compassion</I>, examines how the effectiveness of one mediating structurea homeless rehabilitation center was undermined by government funding;
<LI>James K. Pinkerton, former deputy assistant to Presidents Reagan and Bush for policy planning, describes how the concept of mediating structures has been incorporated into presidential campaigns since 1977.
<LI>Robert L. Woodson, president and founder of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, highlights several successful grassroots mediating institutions that can serve as an inspiration to others.
</UL>
<DD>Looking over their 1977 essay, Berger and Neuhaus 
note that today's political climate is more favorable to 
realizing their vision of reinvigorated mediating institutions.  
Indeed, they originally stressed that they were not 
primarily concerned with reducing the cost of government or 
devolving government responsibilities since &quot;that would be 
tantamount to dismantling the welfare state.&quot;  They now 
state that &quot;it seems plausible to us to be less cautious on 
both counts.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Berger and Neuhaus also note that a major obstacle 
to reviving mediating structures is the &quot;very large and 
powerful vested interests [that] have grown up around 
every policy of the welfare state.  The paradigm shift suggested 
by the concept of mediating structures directly threatens 
some of those interests.  Needless to say, they will fight back. . . . 
The deformation of mediating structures by this process 
of creeping `governmentalism' must be at the center of 
any rethinking of social policy.&quot;

<I>The Home</I><BR></FONT>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>Reviewed by Martin Morse Wooster, Visiting Fellow</B><BR></FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
<DD>One issue often raised in the welfare debate is what to 
do about children who have lost one or both parents or who 
for some reason cannot remain with their biological parents. 
 It's clear that the existing state foster-care system is 
expensive and ineffective.  But would orphanages be a 
practical and humane alternative?
<BR>
<DD>That's the question posed by Richard B. McKenzie in 
his latest book, <I>The Home: A Memoir of Growing Up in 
an Orphanage</I> (New York: Basic Books, 1996, 227 
pages, $22.00).  McKenzie, an economist at the University 
of California at Irvine, is perhaps best known for his 
1993 book <I>What Went Right in the 1980s</I>, an analysis of 
economic policy during the Reagan Administration.  
Unlike McKenzie's usual focus on public policy, 
<I>The Home</I> is a narrative account of McKenzie's boyhood years at a 
North Carolina orphanage.
<BR>
<DD>McKenzie is very candid about his life at The 
Home, telling how his experiences there helped him mature 
and become a responsible adult.  He concludes that on 
balance The Home helped both him and his fellow orphans.  
&quot;Obviously, if any of us had been given a choice between 
growing up with Ozzie and Harriet or in The Home, we would 
surely have taken the former,&quot; he writes.  &quot;But our families 
had failed us, and we didn't want to take the risk that 
another family would do the same.  Virtually all of us today 
shudder at the foster-care option.  Foster families cannot 
offer children a sense of permanence, and the children can 
never be sure whether foster parents are taking them in as 
a personal mission or just for the money.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>McKenzie's account of recent changes at The Home 
is engaging if not saddening.  During the 1950s, 
when McKenzie was there, the institution was affiliated with 
the Presbyterian Church.  It had large farms where the 
orphans worked after school and during the summer.  It also had 
its own school, although in later years McKenzie and 
his fellow orphans went to a nearby high school.
<BR>
<DD>In the late 1960s, The Home underwent massive change. 
 Its board decided to transform the institution into a 
foster-care center, admitting only troubled children.  
Meanwhile, The Home's administrators, while retaining the 
institution's name in order to attract donors, cut off relations 
with alumni and forbade them from visiting students 
during reunion weekends.
<BR>
<DD>McKenzie observes that as a foster-care center, 
The Home has become vastly more expensive.  Tuition is 
now $45,000 a year!almost twice as much as Harvard 
tuition and fifteen times more than when McKenzie was there.  
And despite these huge fees, the school no longer provides 
jobs for students because it cannot afford to pay them.
<BR>
<DD>Surveying other orphans who grew up in The 
Home, McKenzie finds that most have become solid 
citizensministers, managers, doctors, bankers.  Far from 
being damaged by their time in The Home, McKenzie argues 
that they gained a sense of permanence they would never 
have had if they had bounced from one foster home to the next. 
 &quot;Children need, at a minimum, a safe, stable, 
structured, and permanent place that provides opportunities for 
personal growth, a chance to live down and away from 
the problems of their past.  They need the break I was 
lucky enough to get at The Home.&quot;

Care?&quot; <I>The Public Interest</I>, Winter 1996.)<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration claims that its military intervention in Haiti has been one of the greatest foreign policy successes in American history. During the vice presidential debate on October 9, 1996, Vice President Albert Gore said that Operation Restore Democracy is "one of the most deft uses of diplomacy and military force in combination that you will find anywhere in the annals of the history of this country."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The truth, however, is that two years after Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored to the Haitian presidency under the protective umbrella of 23,000 American soldiers -- and at a cost of $3 billion to America's taxpayers -- Haiti remains a cauldron of barely contained violence. Despite this ill-advised intervention in domestic Haitian politics, democracy has not come to Haiti.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Instead, a one-party government controlled by Aristide's Lavalas party has shut out most of Haiti's genuine democrats. An Aristide puppet, Rene Preval, now rules Haiti as president. Economic reforms are stalled. There are no property rights. The judicial system does not function. An inexperienced and weak U.S.-trained Haitian police force has been unable to stop political killings, and is outnumbered by more than 6,000 armed members of rival left-wing gangs and right-wing demobilized soldiers who are responsible for growing urban and rural violence. Economic and political pressures to migrate from Haiti to the U.S. remain high. Finally, despite massive amounts of U.S. aid, about 70 percent of the people are illiterate, and 60 percent remain unemployed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>President Preval: Aristide's Puppet.</b> Aristide would still be president of Haiti today if the Clinton Administration had not pressured him strongly in 1995 to step aside and allow a democratic transition of power to a new elected president. Aristide chose Rene Preval as his successor. On December 17, 1995, Preval, a lifelong friend and close supporter of Aristide, was elected President of Haiti.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, turnout was light as 21 Haitian political parties boycotted the elections to protest what some opposition leaders called Aristide's "use of the cloak of democracy to justify the installation of a dictatorship."<sup>1</sup>  More than 70 percent of the country's 3.7 million eligible voters stayed home, many of them intimidated by supporters of Aristide who systematically harassed and murdered his political opponents throughout 1995 in advance of the presidential elections.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some two dozen democratic Haitian leaders opposed to Aristide were murdered during 1995 while Aristide was still in power -- and while American troops were still stationed in large numbers on Haitian soil. Members of Aristide's hand-picked, U.S.-trained palace security unit in Port-au-Prince were implicated directly in many of these killings. Nonetheless, Aristide rejected private entreaties by U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Swing, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and other U.S. officials that he fire the suspects and order police investigations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Clinton: Unable to Stop the Killing.</b> On September 24, 1996, White House counsel Jack Quinn notified Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), Chairman of the House Committee on International Relations, that President Clinton had invoked executive privilege to deny a request for key documents that might shed some light on whether the Administration has tried to conceal the fact that U.S. officials have known since early 1995 that "death squads" loyal to Aristide are operating out of the presidential palace.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Representative Gilman says that the Clinton Administration "has been aware since early 1995 that death-squads were operating under the direction of top security aides to President Aristide."<sup>2</sup>  Ambassador Swing reported the first killings in a cable to the State Department dated February 18, 1995; he also admitted in a September 1995 cable to the State Department that the Aristide government had stonewalled an FBI investigation of these political assassinations. In fact, not one of the Clinton Administration officials who testified before or briefed the House Committee on International Relations on ten separate occasions in 1995 ever revealed any information about these specific reports of palace death squads. The first such acknowledgment did not occur until public testimony before the committee on January 4, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When Preval became president in 1996, Aristide's palace guards -- trained in Virginia by American security experts at a cost of more than $5.5 million to U.S. taxpayers -- remained at Preval's side. Moreover, killers assigned to the presidential security unit continued to gun down Aristide's opponents. The Clinton Administration, for example, has information implicating members of the palace guard in the August 20, 1996, political assassinations of the Reverend Antoine Leroy and Jacques Fleurival, leaders of the opposition Mobilization for National Development (MDN), in Port-au-Prince. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott, however, did not tell the House committee, in sworn written testimony submitted on September 9, 1996, that Haitians implicated in the 1995 political killings of Aristide's opponents remained in the Haitian palace guard.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On September 13, 1996, the Clinton Administration rushed 22 armed bodyguards from the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) to Port-au-Prince to guard the life of President Preval. This group of American security officials was reinforced by 22 Navy and Air Force civilian guards and contractors, in addition to 70 Canadian soldiers who were deployed in a security perimeter surrounding the presidential palace. The day before the U.S. bodyguards arrived in Port-au-Prince, Preval transferred the head of the palace guard (Joseph Moise) and his deputy (Milien Romage) to other security functions within the Haitian government. As many as a dozen political assassins loyal to Aristide may still hold their jobs in the palace guard, working alongside U.S. government bodyguards assigned to protect Preval.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Haiti's rising violence and political instability reportedly have prodded Pentagon planners to revisit contingency plans for the possible reintroduction of U.S. troops. These troops would be in addition to the 160 U.S. soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division that were deployed briefly in July 1996 after the Clinton Administration learned of credible assassination threats against Aristide and Preval, and 50 U.S. Marines that were sent to Port-au-Prince on August 20, 1996, following the commando-style executions of opposition leaders Leroy and Fleurival. Although Clinton Administration officials have explained the rotation of American combat troops through Haiti as "training exercises," Ambassador Swing acknowledged to Congress on September 27, 1996, that these small U.S. troop deployments are intended to augment security and keep the lid on Haiti.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Stuck in Haiti.</b> Prominent Members of Congress suspect that the Clinton Administration is misleading both Congress and the American people about Haiti. Congressional efforts to overcome the Administration's stonewalling on Haiti should be intensified. In an October 22, 1996, press release issued by the House International Relations Committee, Representative Gilman said that "Enough evidence exists to justify a further inquiry into the possible existence of a conspiracy to withhold this information from Congress."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House and Senate should challenge President Clinton's use of executive privilege to hide the failure of Operation Restore Democracy. They can do this by holding hearings on Haiti and by compelling the appearance -- as witnesses under oath -- of top Administration officials involved in Haiti policy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the Administration balks at disclosing the truth about Haiti, Congress should take steps to block all financial aid to Haiti from the Agency for International Development (AID) and multilateral lenders such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Inter-American Development Bank. Congress also should block further U.S. funding for the Canadian-led U.N. security mission in Haiti and compel the withdrawal of all remaining U.S. troops and other American security officials from Haiti. Finally, the U.S. should make it clear to Haiti's government and people that all Haitian immigrants caught trying to enter America illegally will be repatriated immediately and without appeal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to get to the bottom of what is going on in Haiti. U.S. personnel in Haiti are in danger of becoming not guarantors of democracy, but a palace guard for a corrupt and bloody regime.

<CENTER>by Malcolm Wallop</CENTER>
<P>
Washington has taken such a beating in recent decades
because the citizens of this great country do not believe that
the Congress or the White House know the value of a tax dollar.
 Oh, they say they do.  It is a great sound bite on the campaign
trail.  The new freshman class in Congress seems to understand.
 They have held the leadership's feet to the fire through the
entire budget debate.  We can only hope that the freshman stay
vigilant, do not get seduced by the trappings of Washington, and
maintain a determination to keep sacred the value of the tax dollar.
<P>
The Clinton Administration could stand to take a
few lessons from the Republican House freshmen.  It is not a stretch
to say that Bill Clinton's &quot;ethic&quot;-that the government
is the nursemaid of all citizens-has been wholeheartedly embraced
by all presidential and political appointees.  It is remarkable
to what a broad extent that ethic has been transformed into government
policy.
<P>
Case in point.  The Clinton Administration's premise:
Cigarette smoke is bad for your health.  The Clinton Administration's
answer?  Destroy the tobacco industry with taxpayer funds and
protect us from ourselves.
<P>
The issue of tobacco and its effects on our health
is a legitimate issue, but the government's vendetta singling
out an industry is quite another.  I am not just talking about
the FDA rule to limit the tobacco industry's First Amendment rights.
 The proposed FDA rule is a dangerous course that Bill Clinton
willingly charts. He and his ilk prefer politics to the Constitution.
 The First Amendment is a simple nuisance, the Constitution is
an impediment to efficient government.
<P>
We Americans have become immune to our lawmakers
chipping away at our Constitutional rights.  We no longer lash
out when they whittle away at more of our freedoms.  When Americans
do lash out at their government, they are dismissed as radicals,
anarchists, militia members, or simply, the &quot;angry block.&quot;
 Nonetheless, when these attacks on our personal freedoms are
done with taxpayers money, all Americans must stand up and take
notice.
<P>
Whether you like smoking or not, your money is being
used to destroy the American tobacco industry.  If you think this
is all right, just think of this. Do you enjoy a nice thick steak
on occasion?  How about a cold beer during a hot summer day or
a nice glass of wine during an elegant meal?  I do and, in fact,
I occasionally enjoy a cigar.
<P>
Is it a stretch to think that this government could
attack other American industries such as the meat industry or
the alcohol industry.  On September 19, 1995, approximately 40
anti-drinking organizations wrote to President Clinton asking
for the FDA rule be applied to cover the sale of alcohol, as well.
 And that is how it begins.
<P>
Once the first spark hits, all gasoline burns.  The
Clinton Administration jumps into its &quot;nanny&quot; role and
begins spending taxpayer dollars to &quot;protect&quot; us all
from &quot;evils&quot; of their choosing.
<P>
Just this year, the National Cancer Institute awarded
a grant of $606,000 to Stanton Glantz, Ph.D. to &quot;study&quot;
tobacco industry political contributions and their effect on legislative
policy in California.  The National Cancer Institute is a scientific
body not a political research firm.  In what scientific realm
does the study of political contributions fall?  Furthermore,
could NCI find anyone more biased than anti-smoking crusader Glantz?
 Speaking to a  conference in April of 1990, Dr. Glantz remarked,
&quot;We are on a roll and the bastards [tobacco industry] are
on the run and I urge you to keep chasing them.  In researching
scientific data, one would assume that credible research comes
from a totally objective approach to a given project.  Giving
Dr. Glantz a grant to study the tobacco industry is akin to the
EEOC giving Mark Furman a grant to study race relations.
<P>
Another example of President Clinton's efforts to
kill the tobacco industry is a $950,000 grant to Northeastern
University to, in the words of professor Richard Daynard, principle
investigator, &quot;develop strategies to thwart the bullying
tactics of the tobacco industry.&quot;  By the way, Professor
Daynard has been an advocate of tobacco control policies since
the mid-70's.  I would say that qualifies him as an &quot;objective&quot;
researcher.  Of course, we are talking about the Clinton Administration
where scientific data is less relevant than the point they're
after.
<P>
These two absurd grants simply scratch the surface.
 If that $606,000 and that $950,000 of taxpayers money can be
used to investigate the tobacco industry, look out, your industry
could very well be next.  There is no constitutional basis or
authority for their assault.  Again, it is the battle between
those who believe in big government and those whose preference
is limited government.  It is the battle between those who believe
that one tax dollar is theirs to spend in any way and those who
would like that tax dollar returned to the taxpayer.
<P>
To smokers or those who detest smoking, funding these
federal projects to promote a political motive is unethical. 
Moreover, funding these projects to single out and destroy a particular
industry is near criminal.
<P>
While the President goes after the tobacco industry
with a vengeance, his administration happily uses other taxpayer
dollars to benefit his political friends.  Between July of 1993
and June of 1994, the Clinton Administration handed the AFL-CIO
over $2 million, the National Education Association $385,000,
the Teamsters over $3.5 million.  What did Democrats get in return
from the happy Unions?  From 1988 to 1993, Unions gave Democrat
House Members $57 million to $4.7 for Republicans.  In that same
time span, Unions gave Democrat Senate candidates $15 million
to $1.5 million for Republicans.  In 1994, the Democratic National
Committee received $835,000 from Unions and the Republican National
Committee received, are you ready?-$0.
<P>
Here it is in a nutshell.  Spend lavishly to kill
an industry in free market America and then turn around to give
taxpayer money to your friends.  Bill Clinton is truly amazing.
 He finds nothing wrong with this scenario.
<P>
Every single tax dollar begins as the fruits of someone's
labor.  Using taxpayer money to destroy an industry or help a
political friend is wrong and Bill Clinton, had he any conviction,
would agree.

<H2>Avoid Political Extinction with A New Shade of Green</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The modern environmental movement evolved from the conservation movement of the turn of the century.  We can be grateful for the many notable successes of the early conservationists.  They alerted America to serious problems like "cut and run" timber harvesting, overgrazing government lands, and vanishing game.  However they also gave us a legacy to overcome.  Here's how it evolved.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
After the deprivations of the Great Depression and World War II, Americans had 25 years of material success.  Environmental sensitivity posed few constraints on the economic boom.  In the economic growth, environmental costs went largely unaccounted for.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
But as the Americans prospered, gaining in education and affluence, there was an environmental awakening. Rachel Carson's <CITE>Slient Spring</CITE> and the first Earth Day in 1970 opened niches for politicians.  They responded to the nation's growing concern over environmental quality with command-and-control legislation.  Environmental goals implied federal management, political mandates, and stringent regulations. The costs of legislation like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act were high but so were the benefits.  The Cuyahoga River is no longer flammable and airborne lead dropped 98 percent.

<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Environmentalism Today</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Today, environmentalism is in crisis.  Many early environmentalists came out of the radical movements of the late 1960s.  They were largely innocent of basic economic principles, hostile to business and the market process, and highly optimistic regarding the potential of federal command-and-control regulation.  Some, especially the deep ecologists, advocated a halt to economic progress and a return to simpler, more primal living.  This approach, however romantic, has important economic, ecological, social, and ethical flaws.
</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
As the bureaucratic pathologies of Progressive-Era agencies like the Forest Service and modern agencies like the EPA multiplied, violations of efficiency and liberty became increasingly obvious.  The "wise use" movement succeeded the Sagebrush Rebellion as rural frustration with federal arrogance mounted.  </P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Again, politicians responded.  Helen Chenoweth (R-ID), Don Young (R-AK), and others tried scaling back federal environmental oversight.  But the Republican position on the environment is opportunistic and ultimately self-defeating. Republicans promise to improve the education and prosperity of Americans.  What Republicans consistently neglect, however, is that environmental sensitivity increases with wealth and education.  </P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Don Coursey, dean of the <A HREF="http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/orgs/gspps/">Harris School of Public Policy</A> at the University of Chicago, demonstrates that environmental quality is like BMWs:  as income increases 1 percent, demand for environmental quality increases 2.5 percent.  Simply put:  the affluent and well-educated demand environmental quality
</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Newt Gingrich acknowledges this reality by saying, "I don't think any party can be a sustainable majority that ignores or rejects its environmental responsibilities."  So he shouldn't be surprised if Republicans lose the majority.  The word "environment" doesn't appear in the Contract with America.  I just recevied a fund-raising letter from the <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org">Republican National Committee</A> which named dozens of issues but didn't even mention the environment. 
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Republicans consistently neglect positive environmental reform and cave in to special interests which promote extractive industries and regional subsidies.  Yet well-off, well-educated voters increasingly say, "But Newt, we love the environment!"  Republicans are taking political heat for giving their environmental portfolio to wise-use sympathizers like Young and Chenoweth.  Many Republicans stay home or even defect to the Democrats who support the traditional environmental agenda.  Their own party gives them no comfortable niche.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
In August, environmentalist and conservationist groups with 20 million members met to voice displeasure with the Republican environmental platform. One participating group, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, makes the links between environmentalism, education, and prosperity clear.  The average TU member has an income of $105,000, and 40% of their members have a master's, law, M.D, or Ph.D degree.  Their membership is "conservative on almost every issue apart from the environment," according to TU's communications director Peter Rafle.

Instead of appealing to this important and growing constituency, Republicans offered ethanol subsidies, salvage logging, and lax efforts to preserve endangered species.  But as Americans become wealthier and wiser they abhor such policies.  Republican Party strategists appear dim-witted or cowardly.  Is exploitation their only alternative to command-and-control, Al Gore statism?
</P><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/free/Images/Briefcase.gif" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=171>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>A New Shade of Green</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>A different shade of green respects ecology, liberty, and prosperity.  Rather than pit the environment against the economy, it harmonizes complementary values.  This evolving environmental vision recognizes the problems inherent to bureaucracies and stresses the importance of local knowledge, incentives, and entrepreneurial innovation.  It rejects government as an engine of plunder while respecting links between property rights and stewardship.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
This new shade of green is evolving.  Environmental groups like <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife </A> have had remarkable successes with their voluntary conservation programs.  Firms like <A HREF="http://www.amoco.com">Amoco</A>, Coors, and Port Blakely Tree Farms are creating new value by protecting the environment and improving the bottom line.  And even some government programs are beginning to use market processes to better coordinate management of public lands.

If the learning curves of Republicans don't slope upward, that species of elephant may go extinct.  And if Al Gore's statist platform doesn't adapt as well, in the election of 2000, his earth will be way out of balance.  There is a vacant niche for political entrepreneurs who appeal to well-educated, wealthier, greener Americans.  Candidates who can't find it deserve to fail come November.

<FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><H2>Clinton's "Green Decrees":  Easy Answers Postpone Reform</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Election politics brought a wave of "green decrees" from Washington.  President Clinton has locked in the support of national environmental groups by resolving environmental controversies by executive order.
</P><P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Utah Monument</B></FONT><BR><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Most recently, Clinton declared 1.7 million acres of southern Utah (seven times larger than Mount Rainier National Park) a national monument, using authority granted under the 1906 Antiquities Act.  With a stroke of a pen, Clinton resolved a bitter, highly polarized debate between environmentalists, who want to see 5.7 million acres declared "wilderness areas" off limits to any development, and locals, who believe the land is so special because they've been stewarding it for 150 years.  There were no Utah officials present at the signing that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) described as "the mother of all land grabs."  They were not consulted on the matter; the locals and the public were the last to know.  Now Utahns are working fervently to thwart the monument's existence and operation.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Snubbing Utahns is a small price for Clinton to pay for the support of the environmental groups; he finished third, behind Ross Perot, in Utah in 1992.  If the monument survives legal challenge, tourism will replace coal jobs.  Locals will guide buses, ATVs, and campers into the monument, rather than drive coal out.</P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="/free/Images/Owl.gif" WIDTH=357 HEIGHT=156 ALT="Spotted Owl">
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Headwaters Forest</B></FONT><BR> 
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>A week earlier, the Administration brokered a halt to the logging in the northern California Headwaters Forest.  Headwaters holds the largest remaining old-growth redwood stand on private property.  As hundreds of protestors and a few celebrities, including pop singer Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley of the Eagles, were arrested, federal officials secretly engineered a tentative agreement with Pacific Lumber to halt the logging in exchange for other government lands and cash payments.  Clinton exploited yet another environmental crisis.  If the tenuous agreement stands, the federal and California governments can expect to spend $350 million to forge a ceasefire in Headwaters.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>New World Mine</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Yellowstone's New World Mine exemplifies Clinton using a green decree to make messy environmental conflicts disappear.  The dispute involved Crown Butte Mines Inc., environmentalists, the Park Service, the Forest Service, locals, and even the United Nations.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>In exchange for $65 million in federal lands, Crown Butte forfeits (if the deal goes through) the mineral rights on their land obtained under the Mining Law of 1872.  Voila!  The beast is vanquished.  Clinton can return to Yellowstone, having triumphantly made the dirty mine go away.  
</P>
<P>Until the next gold mine.  Or the next coal mine.  Or the next timber stand.  
</P><IMG ALIGN="Right" SRC="/free/Images/Scape.gif" WIDTH=328 HEIGHT=241 ALT="Landscape">
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Green Decrees as Quick Fixes</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Clinton's green decrees are quick fixes, often at the great expense of other natural treasures and local communities.  For example, as the New World Mine controversy so beautifully illustrates, the Mining Law of 1872 is long overdue for reform.  The myopic 1872 law provides for mineral deposits on federal lands to be turned into commodities like gold and copper, while ignoring other values:  undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed watersheds, and unscarred land.  Although this made sense in the Civil War era, relative values have drastically changed with increased education, scientific knowledge, and affluence.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
A truly courageous president would call for fundamental reform.  He would advocate systems that provide incentives to conserve, to account for downstream pollution, and to foster responsible use of the land.  </P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>An Alternative</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Here's an idea for some political entrepreneur:  Propose a system that replicates for environmental values what the 1872 Law does for minerals.  It would give individuals opportunities to invest in and protect the land for its amenity and ecological features, like wilderness, biodiversity, and recreation.  Public, nonprofit organizations and trusts could stake a "claim" on federal lands, like BLM districts in Utah, and attempt to produce a "mother lode" of environmental quality.  Like mining claims, these would be contingent on "proving up" the environmental qualities of the land.  This way the claimholders would have to be prepared to meet the public challenges of competing users.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
This sort of change would dramatically alter the nature of the environmental debate in the West.  In addition to reforming outdated legislation, it would move environmentalists from the Beltway to the back country.  No longer would green decrees come from the White House.  Federal authority would serve in its proper role of monitoring and enforcement, not opportunistic rule-setting on an ad hoc basis.
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Politics Brings Gridlock, Conflict</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Clinton's green decrees are surprisingly effective election politics.  This strategy gets good press because it perpetuates the polarization and gridlocks real reform.  But this short-sightedness is the predictable consequence of political allocation.  Voters may get tired of crisis management of popular areas.  If so, some candidates will advocate genuine reform and be rewarded by voters for honestly analyzing the underlying causes of environmental problems.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>There is another problem with Clinton's tactics.  Using executive fiat to make others pay for something you want generates perverse consequences and intractable conflicts.  The counterproductivity of green decrees is glaring in Utah's Kane County.  The county is now backing out of an agreement to release endangered California condors into the region.  After the green decree, county attorney Colin Winchester warns, "We're going to be a whole lot less cooperative with the federal government."</P></TABLE>

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A powerful grass-roots movement is slowly gathering force that may transform the politics of American education. Its human face is not white but black; its resources few but its determination strong. And its goal is freedom. Although most black political leaders still actively oppose vouchers and charter schools, their constituents are growing increasingly angry at the public schools' disastrous record of teaching black children. As a result, black parents, pastors, local officials, and civil-rights leaders are beginning to embrace school vouchers, charter schools, and other reforms that offer alternatives to dismal public schools. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These African Americans believe that academic achievement is the key to their economic independence. They want schools that involve them in their children's education while imposing high standards and strict discipline, and they reject the notion that poverty somehow renders parents less interested in their children's academic well-being. As their numbers swell, teachers unions will find it increasingly difficult to hold back reforms that offer black children a better chance. 
<p><table width="170" align="left" cellpadding="3">

<hr width=75></td>

</table>
<br><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This new movement is already spreading throughout the country. In Cleveland, African Americans like councilwoman Fannie Lewis, school principals Lydia Harris and Sister Hasina Renee, and school-board member Genevieve Mitchell led the fight for a new state law that provides vouchers this fall for 2,000 low-income children. Lewis, Harris, Renee, and Mitchell vigorously supported Republican governor George Voinovich as he moved his voucher proposal through the state legislature. Lewis recruited 300 citizens in her neighborhood of Hough, the site of race riots in 1968, to travel to Columbus to lobby for the scholarship program. Last fall, when the governor's staff organized a press conference to announce the signing of the bill, jubilant black students and their parents packed the hallways and aisles.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, support for vouchers in Cleveland was so strong that nearly 6,300 students, almost all of them black, applied for only 2,000 slots, which were filled by lottery. By mid-September of this year, 1,410 of the students had enrolled in a religious school. Councilwoman Lewis, a mother and 46-year Cleveland resident, attributes this flight to public schools' dismal educational record and indifference to parents. "The quality of public schools in Hough is poor," she says. "The roofs leak and the schools sometimes lack books, chairs, and other materials. Of the more than $7,000 spent on each child in the Cleveland public schools, only a fraction goes to classroom education." Thanks to vouchers, this fall Lewis was able to open her own community school, the Hough-Brooks Academy for Higher Learning -- a nonsectarian school run by a community board with a curriculum emphasizing the arts and cultural awareness. Lewis hopes this will "force school officials to pay more attention to parents' concerns and to provide safer and better schools." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Milwaukee, as Dan McGroarty has shown in his new book, <i>Break These Chains</i>, blacks have been the principal supporters of two Wisconsin voucher programs. "The battle for Parental Choice," McGroarty writes, "began in the church basements and meeting halls of Milwaukee's Near North Side," a poor neighborhood where only 48 percent of adults hold a job. "From the start, the Milwaukee proponents' language was appropriated from the civil-rights movement. Their rhetoric was more redolent of Martin Luther King Jr. than the free-market pronouncements favored by conservative voucher proponents."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The engineer of Milwaukee's first voucher plan, which was limited to nonsectarian schools, was Annette "Polly" Williams, a black Democratic state representative from the Near North Side. Having fought the school system a dozen years earlier for busing her daughter to a bad public school, Williams was familiar with the Milwaukee education establishment's indifference to the needs of low-income black families. "The system is the system. It doesn't care. It doesn't feel," Williams told McGroarty. "The way I saw it, [it] is preparing our children for slavery. Look at the situation: Drop out by 10th grade, get into the street life. When you should be walking across the stage getting a diploma, you're standing in front of a judge wearing chains." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Committed to breaking up the system for the sake of the young black children in her community, Williams gradually mobilized her army of mothers and grandmothers, most of whom were on welfare, and all of whom were determined to "do right by their children." Aware of her army's powerful impact on lawmakers, she convinced the chairman of the state assembly's urban-education committee to hold a public hearing on her school-choice plan on the morning of February 23, 1990. The three-hour-long hearing, which attracted 200 low-income minority parents and children, prompted the committee to approve her proposal. Soon thereafter, it passed the assembly and the senate and was signed into law by Republican governor Tommy Thompson. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Throughout the endeavor, only one local newspaper captured Williams's crusade in a concise and accurate way: <i>Community Journal</i>, whose editor, Mikel Holt, is yet another fan of school choice. As for Milwaukee's mainstream dailies, McGroarty notes, "they attacked Williams repeatedly. One went as far as portraying her in a cartoon as a stick-up artist pointing a pistol at a public-school teacher." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Having survived a grueling round of constitutional scrutiny, the program generated so much support that in September 1994, 750 mostly low-income blacks rallied for its expansion. This time, a new generation of African-American educators joined Williams in the battle. They included Zakiya Courtney, then principal of the Urban Day School and now the director of a grass-roots group called Parents for School Choice; Brother Bob Smith, the principal of the outstanding inner-city school Messmer High; and Howard Fuller, then superintendent of Milwaukee public schools. Last year, the school board and the teachers unions mailed 3,000 videotapes attacking Fuller's stance on choice, calling it an attempt to scale back or completely cut educational programs. The unions succeeded in establishing an anti-reform majority on the board of education, which prompted Fuller's resignation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But according to a February 1995 report by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 95 percent of African Americans polled in Milwaukee support school choice, and 70 percent believe that students in private and religious schools get a better education than students in the Milwaukee public schools. Finally ceding to their constituents' demands, the Wisconsin legislature last year expanded the program to include religious schools, increased the number of vouchers from 1,500 to 15,000, and eliminated restrictions on the number of choice students in participating schools. In response, voucher opponents immediately and successfully sought an injunction from the courts and have, so far, blocked the plan's implementation. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The parents, however, are equally determined. In February 1996, for instance, Courtney filled nine buses with 500 mostly black parents and children to attend a rally at the capitol, in Madison. There they voiced their enthusiasm for the newly enacted plan, which was being challenged in the Wisconsin Supreme Court. After a tie vote, the court sent the case back to trial court, where Dane County Circuit Judge Paul Higginbotham refused to lift the injunction blocking religious schools' participation in the program. "The state cannot do indirectly what it can't do directly," he said.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Higginbotham did allow the state to issue up to 15,000 vouchers for private nonreligious schools. But Courtney and Milwaukee's parents eagerly await the day the court will grant them complete authority over the upbringing of their children -- including the freedom to send them to a religious school. Meanwhile, 4,500 low-income Milwaukee students are going to religious schools this year with privately financed vouchers -- thanks to the generosity of the Bradley Foundation and 1,040 private donors who gave more than $4 million to help the students hurt by Higginbotham's decision.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Florida, T. Willard Fair, the president and chief executive officer of the liberal Urban League of Miami, and the Reverend R.B. Holmes, a black Baptist pastor from Tallahassee, are the principal supporters of a new charter school law enacted in April. The Florida plan allows any creative educator to open a school, free of the red tape that binds most public schools (such as  teacher certification and state-imposed standards). Fair formed a partnership with Jeb Bush, the conservative Republican candidate for governor in 1994, to advance the legislation. Fair described public schools as "too regulated, entrenched in bureaucracy, with overcrowded classrooms, out-of-control children, and teachers who are not held accountable due to too much union interference." And so he created Florida's first charter school, whose student body is almost entirely low-income and African-American.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Similarly, Holmes opened the C.K. Steele-Leroy Collins charter middle school, with a student body that is 75 percent black. His school is modeled after a Christian academy he created five years ago, which he describes as a school that "all people, [whether] black, white, rich, or poor want to send their kids to." To Holmes, charter schools mean "freedom to teach reading, writing, arithmetic, respect, responsibility, and entrepreneurship all in one--without the bureaucratic strings attached." A 1995 survey by the Foundation for Florida's Future found that Florida's black citizens supported school choice and charter schools by 68 percent and 63 percent, respectively.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In California, voucher supporters include Anyam Palmer, the principal of the Afrocentric Marcus Garvey School in South Central Los Angeles, who views "the present school system [as] the vehicle that puts us on welfare, in prison, and leaves us illiterate. . . . School choice is the only way out of this vicious cycle." "Public education is not working for most minority citizens in the inner city," says Bishop George D. McKinney Jr. of San Diego, who has set up a school at St. Stephen's Church of God in Christ. Testifying for vouchers last year before the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families,  McKinney faulted public schools for "low expectations . . . of minority students" and "the systematic tracking of minority students toward nonacademic programs." A recent survey of South Central's residents by the Center for the Study of Popular Culture found that 77 percent of minorities supported vouchers. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Californians may not win the right to vouchers in the near future, but an innovative charter-school law, passed in 1992, offers blacks a close alternative. According to the Hudson Institute, the California plan gives "charter petitioners the right to seek significant autonomy from local board control [and provides] a blanket waiver from most state laws and regulations." Jonathan Williams, the black principal of the Accelerated School, in South Central Los Angeles, says that a charter-school system offers "more freedom, choice, and responsibility." Accelerated's student body comprises 50 percent blacks and 50 percent Hispanics; a majority of students belong to low or low-moderate income groups.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Williams believes charter schools are the solution to the educational crisis. "With charters you can keep the system public and free, while instilling stronger accountability," he contends. Without union pressure and  handouts, "I feel like a professional instead of a wage earner." Williams's school sits in a gang-infested neighborhood. "It is not unusual for us to hear gun fights, and notice the residues of drug abuse around the school grounds," he says. But with a low student-to-teacher ratio, lots of parental involvement, and zero tolerance toward violence and drugs, Williams avoids the problems that incapacitate many public schools every year. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Michigan, the TEACH Michigan Education Fund reports that black educators have launched one out of every three Michigan charter schools. According to Bryan Taylor, the fund's executive director, "5,000 applicants applied for 330 spots when the first charter school came to Detroit; African-American educators led most of them." In Michigan, where charter schools are called "public-school academies," the law allows any individual or group to develop a charter and to seek sponsorship from a variety of entities such as the board of a state public university. The program's key supporters include black leaders like the Reverend Ned Adams Jr., an official of the Council of Baptist Pastors, which assists member churches in Detroit interested in starting charter schools; and Larry Patrick, the former president of the Detroit Board of Education and an avid advocate "for parents having as many choices as possible for the education of their children."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another black charter-school fan is Freya Rivers. The frustrated former Lansing public-school teacher now serves as district superintendent, full-time language-arts teacher, and part-time janitor and nurse. Her school, the Sanfoka Shule charter school in Lansing, targets at-risk elementary school students. In the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> earlier this year, she said, "I have two students who were [in special education in traditional Lansing public schools]. They couldn't even write their names or recognize any words. . . . I use the same methods to teach them that I use with the other students. Now both of them are writing sentences." In fact, 85 percent of the first- and second-graders Sanfoka received from Lansing public schools were illiterate; now all are able to read.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Texas, ardent African-American voucher promoters include Democratic state representative Glenn Lewis, the former general counsel for the Tarrant County chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and his liberal legislative colleague Ron Wilson. Fueled by support from a growing number of black churches, including the Reverend Raymond Bryant's Union Center African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Conroe, the leaders foresee a strong chance to enact school choice in their state next year. A 1995 Texas Poll showed black support for vouchers at 59 percent, and a growing number of church groups, ministers, and community groups also believe vouchers are the next step. Says Michael Williams, a black conservative and former assistant education secretary in the Bush administration, "The [African-American] community looks to choice as the vehicle to reclaim control over the learning of the next generation of African-American scholars and leaders." Allan Parker, the president of the Texas Justice Foundation, whose group has convened a citizens' task force to investigate why Texas minority students fare worse than whites on the state's achievement tests, works closely with these leaders in promoting school choice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All of these low-income parents and community leaders seek the same opportunities for their children that middle- and upper-income black parents enjoy. "I don't think African-American parents are any different than other parents," says Michigan's Larry Patrick. "All they want is quality education for their children. Wealthy parents, like the president, can make this choice; poor ones cannot. . . . Most African-American leaders [seem to] practice choice in their own lives and support [it] on a personal level." Denis Doyle, a senior fellow with The Heritage Foundation, notes that black teachers are twice as likely as other black parents to send their children to a private school, and 30 percent of Congressional Black Caucus members with children send their children to private schools. Meanwhile, only 4 percent of blacks possess the means to exercise this option. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps this is why a poll by the left-leaning Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in April 1996 reveals that African Americans favor school choice more strongly than the general population. Support registers highest among women (51 percent), parents (61 percent), and younger African Americans (64 percent among 18- to 25-year-olds, 61 percent among 26- to 35-year-olds). These numbers are particularly telling when you consider that only 18 percent of blacks support the devolving of power from the federal government to the state and local levels. Says Brian Jones, the president of the Center for New Black Leadership, they reflect "a stalwart trend towards reclaiming the power of parents." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With respect to charter schools, the Hudson Institute's Educational Excellence Network recently reported similar positive conclusions. The report finds a high level of satisfaction with charter schools among most students, and cites the schools' clear academic expectations, safety, individualized instruction, committed teachers, and familial atmosphere. Hudson found that 63 percent of the students attending charter schools nationwide belong to a racial minority -- including 19 percent who are African-American--and that 55 percent are poor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What drives African Americans toward choice and charter schools? Standards, discipline, and parental involvement are the three core reasons.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Joyce Watkins, a resident of Chicago's West Side and a mother of seven, wants higher academic standards and eagerly hopes her city will adopt some form of school choice soon. "Where I'm from," she says, "public education offers leftovers. It means getting lost in the cracks." What frustrates Watkins the most is public-school teachers' lack of interest in her children's academic achievement. "They come home without homework sometimes," she laments. "The quality of education is really low. . . . I often wonder if teachers and school counselors even know my children's names, since they are too busy disciplining unruly students." Watkins would prefer sending her children to Providence St. Mel, a Catholic school in her neighborhood, even though she belongs to a different Christian denomination. "If they gave us more choices, more kids would go to school, stay in school, and graduate to college. . . . You would also see the crime rate go down because the kids would be in class, not on the streets. . . . That's where the opportunity lies." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Gloria Grayson, a mother in Milwaukee whose two daughters now attend a private school, abhors the absence of strict disciplinary guidelines in public schools. "They were not learning. Classes were large and pupil-to-teacher ratios were high," she says. "The children were afraid and could not concentrate because they had to deal with their undisciplined peers rather than listen and learn in class. Teachers were not able or did not try to maintain adequate control over their classes. As a result, classes progressed slowly. Teachers and administrators had nothing but excuses for the poor education my children were receiving. The . . . schools are filled with drugs and violence. They graduate drug dealers. At best, children leave those schools not with a diploma, but with battle scars." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Grayson and Watkins join other parents and educators in blaming the education system's lack of interest in their concerns. After all, as Cleveland councilwoman Fannie Lewis notes, "parents have little influence over education policy. The school board often will go into executive session to shut out community attendance at its meetings." Texas legislator Glenn Lewis, whose constituents show their anger by picketing outside school-board meetings, concurs. He considers choice a means to provide parents with more leverage over the school boards and "an opportunity to improve public schools . . . because so long as they are guaranteed our parents' dollars, they have no incentives to listen." According to a poll by the Center for Education Reform, 61 percent of blacks say "the quality of their public school could be improved a great deal," compared with 44 percent of the general population.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To find those key ingredients of a good education, black parents often gravitate towards religious education. As Fannie Lewis observes, "in most instances [the parents'] decisions have nothing to do with religion. They want their children in a safe environment with strong disciplinary standards where they can get a good education." Sectarian schools constitute 85 percent of all private schools; of that share, more than half are Catholic. Others include religious schools run by Baptists, Lutherans, Seventh-Day Adventists, and Muslims. These schools, especially in urban areas, enroll growing numbers of ethnic minority students, according to the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA). NCEA also reports that in the last 20 years, the minority percentages have more than doubled in all Catholic schools, from 10.8 percent in 1970-71 to 23.5 percent in 1992-93. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bob Smith, the veteran superintendent of Milwaukee's Messmer High School, a Catholic school, attests to these facts. "Catholic schools have been known for high-quality education since the black migration from the South. For many years, next to public schools, they were the only safe haven for blacks in the segregation era." He proudly cites the St. Benedict the Moor School, known today as the Urban Day School, as an example. The black all-male boarding school boasts a number of high-profile alumni, including Dizzy Gillespie, the jazz musician; Harold Washington, the first black mayor of Chicago; and Redd Foxx, the comedian and television star. Catholic schools are popular with parents, Smith says, because they are "safe havens against drugs, violence, and uncaring teachers."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A forthcoming study in the <i>Journal of Labor Economics</i> supports the believers in religious schooling by revealing that those most likely to benefit from a Catholic-school education are minorities, many of whom are not Catholic, who attend big-city schools. The paper's author, University of Chicago economist Derek Neal, observes that "in the urban minority sample, Catholic schooling dramatically increases the probability of high school graduation . . . [and increases] college graduation rates." According to Neal, that translates into future wage gains. Among the study's sample of urban blacks and Hispanics, the probability of graduating from high school rises from 62 percent to at least 88 percent when the public-school students are placed in a Catholic secondary school. "For urban whites," he continues, "the effects are . . . always smaller in magnitude. In fact, [their] estimated wage gain from Catholic schooling is not statistically different." Neal concludes that "urban minority students benefit most from access to Catholic schools because their local public-school alternatives are poor."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps this explains why New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently urged educators to use the city's Catholic schools as a "guide" to reforms. He noted in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article in 1995 that the city's Catholic and public schools enroll about the same proportion of students with multiple risk factors, but that Catholic schools have a dropout rate of 0.1 percent, compared with 18 percent in the public schools. Giuliani also observed that, despite popular belief, Catholic schools have expulsion rates of only 2 percent. The mayor has recently proposed a measure allowing students performing in the bottom 5 percent to attend religious schools.<p><table width="170" align="right" cellpadding="3">

</table>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, a recent report by Jay Greene of the University of Houston and Paul Peterson of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government fortifies the supporters of choice. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that students participating in the Milwaukee choice experiment, 70 percent of whom are African American, made major academic improvements compared with a control group in public schools. In fact, after three years, the gap between the test scores of whites and minorities narrowed by 33 to 50 percent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite the growing black support for vouchers, the civil-rights establishment and most black leaders in Congress and state legislatures remain steadfastly opposed. Their explanations range from fears of losing their best students to private schools (so-called creaming) and segregation to concerns that private schools will soak up public funds. Jessica Butler, a spokesperson for the Greater Harrisburg branch of the NAACP, exclaims "tuition vouchers are just the latest scheme for abandoning our public schools." Michael Myers, the president and executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, says, "School choice is a gimmick. There is no such thing as school choice for children who don't have a choice," since private schools get to select the types of students they like.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Militant opposition to choice may also stem from the influence of large, monied teachers unions, which see any choice outside the public schools as a threat to their monopoly. Teachers unions adamantly opposed a small school-choice plan tagged to Congress's District of Columbia appropriations bill last fall. After it passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives, the plan died in the Senate, despite the support of local leaders like Franklin Smith, the city's schools superintendent, and Mayor Marion Barry. Throughout the proceedings, District of Columbia delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and the Congressional Black Caucus sided with the unions and refused to endorse school choice for the city's neediest children. Explaining her reasons for opposing the modest school choice proposal, Norton told the <i>Washington Post</i> on November 3, 1995, "It's not about money, it's about the strong feeling in the District that District schools are where most of the children are going to be, so we need to spend money fixing up our schools." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"School choice creams the public schools of their best students, and robs them of their much needed funds for educating the needy kids left behind," explains Daniel E. Katz, legal counsel for the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). "Choice also raises the specter of segregation." But as Cleveland's Lydia Harris, principal of one of the nation's best private schools, can attest, this description is inaccurate. In <i>World</i> magazine, she recently said, "There's no cream on my crop until we put it there. It's a myth that we take discipline problems and throw them out of school. It's the other way around. I get the kids the public schools can't handle." And she does all this at a per-pupil cost one-seventh that of Cleveland public schools.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Choice is just a subterfuge for segregation, like it was in the South," says Felmers Chaney, the head of the Milwaukee NAACP, which joined the lawsuit against the initial Milwaukee school-choice plan as lead plaintiff. "Taken as a whole, expanded [school choice] will deny African Americans equal educational opportunity," asserted Chaney in a recent brief against the expanded Milwaukee school-choice plan. To many of its black critics, the NAACP seems more concerned with integration than with quality education for black children. Even so, opponents of vouchers need only examine the work of the late James Coleman, of the University of Chicago, which shows not only that poor black youngsters fare better in religious schools than in public schools, but also that a child is more likely to attend school with a child of another race in the private sector than in the public sector. As for the Milwaukee plan, the NAACP ought to take a look at the high level of integration in Milwaukee private schools in comparison to its public schools.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some critics argue that the education establishment opposes school choice for a very basic reason: self-preservation. "Perhaps one of the strongest reasons why the civil-rights establishment opposes choice is economic," says Brian Jones. "They strongly feel that competition and privatization will leave them out in the cold." Public schools employ a large portion of the African-American professional community; some of them may view school choice and charter schools as programs designed to rob them of tenured jobs. To convince public-school employees that market forces will provide jobs for the best teachers and administrators from these public schools is next to impossible. Of course, as Milwaukee's Zakiya Courtney points, the number of kids in the school system won't shrink. "This won't impact the teachers," she says. "It will only affect the pencil pushers."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Will saving jobs justify depriving innocent children of a quality education? To answer this question, these leaders ought to talk to students and their parents, visit the neighborhood private schools these children could go to, and perform a cost-benefit analysis of the savings associated with sending children to these schools. "Once you do this, you can't help but become a believer in school choice," says Messmer's Smith.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	School choice is the civil-rights movement of the 1990s. Says Milwaukee's Polly Williams, "I am one of those people who is supposed to be very stupid because I am black, I live in the inner city, I am poor, and I raised my children in a single parent home. Well, those are lies. The only thing different about us is that we have been deprived of resources and access. When you empower parents like me, there is a major difference. We become responsible for our own lives. . . . We want to be empowered, and that is what the choice program has done."<p>

<h3>Five items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>On Monday and Tuesday nights the CBS and NBC evening <a href="#newscasts">newscasts did not run any stories</a>
from their correspondents traveling with Clinton and Dole. ABC didn't on Tuesday either, but Monday night ABC's Brit Hume
actually employed the term "harsh" to Clinton.
<li>The <a href="#fundraising">questionable fundraising sources</a> for the Democrats is getting some network attention. Tuesday night's World News Tonight included a story a  Florida drug dealer invited to a White House dinner.
<li>A CBS reporter says a second Clinton term will bring more <a href="#moderate">"moderate appointments" to the Supreme Court,</a> but he's immediately contradicted in the next soundbite.
<li>PBS's Frontline asks <a href="#press">"Why America Hates the Press."</a> But in one hour a reason left unmentioned: liberal bias.
<li>CNN's <a href="#rook">Susan Rook</a> cites Bob Dole's divorce as proof his word is not his bond.
</ol>
<a name="newscasts">
<hr>
1) Monday night CBS and NBC covered the day's campaigning with 
their anchors giving brief reports. NBC Nightly News ran a lengthy piece 
from Andrea Mitchell on the Indonesian money trail.
<P>
On the October 21 World News Tonight, Brit Hume reported President 
Clinton's reaction to the fundraising scandals. Hume offered a unique use 
of the term "harsh," applying it to Clinton instead of Dole:
<P>
<DD>"President Clinton though stayed as far above the fracas as possible. 
He personally said not a word about it as he campaigned in Ohio and Michigan
today. But his campaign thought enough of the matter to send out a spokesman 
to denounce Bob Dole on it in the harshest terms."
<BR>
<DD>Joe Lockhart, Clinton-Gore Press Secretary: "You know Bob Dole talking 
about campaign finance reform is like Dr. Jack Kevorkian talking about the 
sanctity of life. It doesn't work. He has no credibility."
<P>
<a name="fundraising">
<hr>
2) On Tuesday's World News Tonight (October 22) Brian Ross explored a 
convicted drug dealer who got a White House dinner for his $20,000.
<P>
<DD>Brian Ross: "At the very time twice convicted Jorge Cabrera was setting 
up his latest cocaine smuggling deal last December in the Florida Keys, 
Democratic fundraisers were arranging for him to attend a White House dinner 
with President Clinton. All it took was a $20,000 campaign contribution to 
the Democratic Party...."
<BR>
<DD>"A few weeks after the White House dinner federal agents raided Cabrera's 
hideout and seized more than 5,000 pounds of cocaine, leading to Cabrera's 
conviction in July. Still, the Democrats didn't return his money until last 
week when after a  reporter for Newsweek asked about it and the party finally 
checked into Cabrera's background. According to Cabrera's lawyer there are 
pictures of the drug smuggler at the White House and at another dinner here 
in Florida with Vice President Gore. But federal prosecutors demanded all 
copies and negatives of those photos and the Justice Department is refusing 
to make them public."
<P>
<a name="moderate">
<hr>
3) MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught this humorous sequence during a 
story on Monday's This Morning on who Dole and Clinton might appoint to the 
Supreme Court. 
<P>
<DD>CBS reporter Troy Roberts: "Court observers believe a Bob Dole presidency 
would move the court to the right and President Clinton would stick with 
moderate appointments should he win a second term."
<P>
<DD>Clint Bolick, Institute for Justice: "Bill Clinton has tended to appoint 
very well qualified people but people who are quite liberal. I expect that he'll 
continue doing that if he gets a second term and the Republican Senate will have 
no option but to confirm those people." 
<P>
<a name="press">
<hr>
4) In most markets Tuesday night PBS aired an edition of Frontline 
titled "Why America Hates the Press." The show approached the subject from the 
left, using the James Fallows critique as its guide. There was plenty on the 
evils of the McLaughlin Group, celebrity journalism, reporters taking speaking 
fees and how awful it was for the Washington Post to put on the front page a 
story about Bob Woodward's new book.
<P>
One theme that was absent: Any consideration of how liberal bias might be 
turning people off. Just take a look at this list of those featured in the PBS 
show, as listed in the Washington Post's TV Week on Sunday:
<P>
"Michael Kelly, editor of the New Republic; the New York Times's R.W. 'Johnny' 
Apple; James Fallows of U.S. News & World report; Tom Brokaw and Andrea Mitchell 
of NBC News; Tim Russert, host of NBC's Meet the Press; McLaughlin Group panelists 
Jack Germond of the Balitimore Sun, Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune; 
Howard Kurtz, Bob Woodward and David Broder of The Washington Post; Paul Taylor, 
a former Post reporter; and National Public Radio's Elizabeth Arnold and 
Cokie Roberts."
<P>
Not a conservative in the list. Fred Barnes snuck on a couple of times, but not
to discuss anything about bias. 
<P>
<a name="rook">
<hr>
5) CNN's Susan Rook took a nice little pot shot at Bob Dole last week. 
In his Media Notes column on October 21, The Washington Post's Howard Kurtz relayed 
an exchange from CNN's TalkBack Live (3-4pm ET), though he didn't provide a show date. 
<P>
After the RNC's Ed Gillespie asserted that for Bob Dole "his word is his bond," 
Rook shot back: "Which word are we talking about? The word to his first wife when 
he said, 'Until death do us part?'" Kurtz noted that after an audience member called 
it a cheap shot, Rook agreed: "Mea culpa. My apologies to Bob and Elizabeth Dole."

<title>Lebed Dismissed But Not Tamed - Heritage</title>

<h3>LEBED DISMISSED BUT NOT TAMED</h3>

Executive Memorandum 465<br>
October 23, 1996<br><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


	On October 17, President Boris Yeltsin fired National Security Aide and Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed, denouncing him for "acting without proper authority" and committing "errors intolerable to Russia." Yeltsin's allies went even further: Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin charged the controversial general with "Bonapartism," while Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov accused him of plotting a coup.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed's dismissal was the culmination of a long and complicated series of maneuvers initiated by Chernomyrdin and Presidential Chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais. With Yeltsin clearly ill and in his last term, all of the politicians around him, including Lebed, have been engaged in a power struggle that is likely to continue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed, an outspoken retired paratroop lieutenant general, emerged as a serious contender for the presidency by finishing third in the first round of presidential elections held on June 16, 1996. The 11 million votes cast in his favor earned him much acclaim -- and numerous enemies in the Kremlin. In the second round of elections, held on July 3, Lebed grudgingly endorsed Yeltsin (and thereby insured his victory) in exchange for being nominated as National Security Aide to the President and Security Council Secretary.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	An extremely ambitious man, Lebed refused to have his authority confined to a merely advisory role on the Security Council. Even before taking office, he succeeded in engineering the dismissal of his rival and former boss, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Lebed then proceeded to meddle in economic affairs, an area normally regarded as the Prime Minister's territory. He also began advocating a new anti-corruption campaign which, had it been implemented, would have been ruinous for the many highly placed Russian officials who often are accused of corruption in the media.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Lebed succeeded in pushing for a swift settlement in Chechnya, which made him the most popular Russian politician. At the same time, however, he challenged the vested interests of extremely influential forces in Russia. Interior Minister Kulikov became his archrival after Lebed demanded his dismissal as the main culprit in the Chechnya fiasco. Virtually the entire upper echelon of power quickly united against Lebed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to senior government officials, the anti-Lebed coalition came to include communists and nationalists. Lebed contributed to the growing sentiment against him by coming out with a series of wild accusations against his own prot‚g‚, the popular Defense Minister General Igor Rodionov. He also made the mistake of allying himself with the extremely unpopular General Alexander Korzhakov, Yeltsin's former chief bodyguard. This move infuriated both President Yeltsin and the Russian media.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	When Lebed finally was ousted, the main charge against him was that he was preparing a coup. This accusation appears to be false. Unlike Chernomyrdin and Chubais, Lebed has neither a nationwide organization nor a strong bureaucratic structure standing behind him. His actions may have been aimed at improving his standing by creating a powerful support structure of his own. He openly proposed creating regional branches for the Security Council, for example, as well as a paramilitary "Russian Legion" to combat organized crime and ethnic violence. According to Kulikov, documents distributed by Lebed indicated that this Legion was supposed to "detain and liquidate leaders of political groups and movements" which threatened national security or the integrity of the Russian state. However, such an apparatus would have taken months to establish.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Had Lebed really planned a mutiny with the aid of his Legion, it is highly unlikely that he would have shared his plans in advance with the Defense and Interior Ministers or sought their consent. However, his proposal was a useful blunder in the hands of his rivals. Kulikov was the one to articulate the charges--with Chernomyrdin's or possibly Yeltsin's approval. Getting Lebed out of the way apparently was a matter of personal survival for Kulikov, since Lebed's people reportedly have accumulated evidence of his involvement in massive fraud and embezzlement in Chechnya.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Lebed still has high hopes for the future. Despite his dismissal, his popularity continues to be high. He is credited with stopping the war in Chechnya, which claimed 100,000 lives. If hostilities resume because of pressure from Kulikov and his allies, Lebed's rating will skyrocket.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Russian public has always favored the political underdog. This helped Boris Yeltsin in the late 1980s, and it is helping Lebed now. Should Yeltsin retire or pass away in the near future, new presidential elections will be called. If this scenario develops, Lebed will have a good chance of succeeding Yeltsin if he can muster enough financial and media support.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Lebed's chief opponent for the presidency would be Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Unlike Lebed, Chernomyrdin lacks charisma; but he does command huge organizational and financial resources as well as the loyalty of local political elites. Chernomyrdin could establish a broad anti-Lebed coalition. The Prime Minister also would be in a position to encourage media efforts to discredit Lebed. But it is too early to tell whether these measures would be sufficient to prevent Lebed from ascending to power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	If Yeltsin remains in power for at least two more years, Lebed's chances of winning the presidency will diminish. Much would depend upon his ability to establish a nationwide political movement and secure the support of local elites and business interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Despite the turmoil surrounding Lebed's dismissal, Russia does not appear to be heading for civil war. The army is politically passive, and its support for Lebed is neither total nor unconditional. Lebed tried to boost his popularity in the armed forces by supporting the disappointed paratroopers against a Defense Ministry decision to cut airborne forces. However, the top brass moved quickly to instill discipline. General Kazantsev, Deputy Commander of the Airborne Troops, was fired for publicly opposing the force reduction and siding with Lebed. Lebed appears to realize that any appeal to the army to rise in mutiny would only provoke bloodshed and ruin his chances of achieving his ambitious political goals peacefully.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Nevertheless, Lebed's dismissal could have a dramatic impact on Russia's domestic and foreign policies. Most important, the peace he worked to secure in Chechnya could be disavowed, causing disaster for Russians and Chechens alike. Lebed's more reasonable approach to NATO expansion and NATO-Russia cooperation also could be renounced. In the economic arena, Chernomyrdin's government will feel more comfortable and confident without Lebed, whose constant support of a larger military budget and subsidies for the military-industrial complex was a thorn in the Prime Minister's side.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	A populist politician, Lebed could initiate a campaign focused on saving the peace in Chechnya and denouncing government corruption. Such an onslaught would mobilize many of his supporters. It is therefore possible that the government might move preemptively against him -- for example, by stepping up the orchestrated media campaign against him, or even by bringing criminal charges.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	During his short time in office, Lebed made many controversial statements on domestic and foreign policy. He has shown himself to be both unpredictable and anything but a team player. His departure leaves the Yeltsin administration more united and consolidated, and thus more predictable for the U.S. -- at least in the short run. To this extent, Lebed's firing could be good news for American policy. However, not everything Lebed stood for was inimical to U.S. interests and values. In dealing with the Kremlin, the Clinton Administration and the West should insist that the best features of Lebed's legacy -- cooperation with NATO, the fight against crime and corruption, and the end of hostilities in Chechnya -- be continued even after his dismissal.

<li><a href="#vargas">On Good Morning America, Elizabeth Vargas</a> asked Jack Kemp
about Bob Dole's hypocrisy in opposing Whitewater pardons after
having supported the pardoning of Casper Weinberger. But Vargas
and others in the media have ignored some key differences.
<li><a href="#shaw">To CNN's Bernard Shaw, raising ethics isn't a valid concern</a>
worthy of discussion. It's either an "attack" or an "insult."

contrarian view Thursday. He suggested that the media are wrong
to consider negative campaigning off limits. 
<li><a href="#nq">The text of the October 21 edition of <I>Notable Quotables</I></a>,
jammed with the most biased quotes of the past two weeks,
including many examples of reporters calling Dole mean and
nasty.

<a name=vargas>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>1)</FONT> MRC analyst Gene Eliasen caught a couple of interesting questions posed during Thursday's Good Morning America. Interviewing Jack Kemp and Leon Panetta, Elizabeth Vargas asked Kemp: 
<blockquote>"Senator Dole had pledged to keep this campaign on a
positive note. You, in your debate said yourself that negative
attacks are, quote, 'beneath Bob Dole.' Why then the decision to
launch specific, some would say negative, attacks last night?"
<br>
    Her next question: "Mr. Kemp, you do know that Senator Dole
also fought to get a pardon for Casper Weinberger several years
ago. It would seem that many, in the eyes of some, it's a bit
hypocritical to criticize the President for, for possibly
considering pardons this year."
</blockquote>
Like other reporters over the past couple of days who have
highlighted the Dole pardon hypocrisy theme, Vargas failed to
note some key differences between Weinberger and Whitewater.
Former independent counsel Lawrence Walsh raised the issue
Tuesday. But the October 16 <I>USA Today</I> noted that Walsh claimed
that Dole had "urged pardons for crimes of constitutional
dimension." Whitewater crimes hardly raise constitutional
balance of power issues. There is a difference between a
President pardoning business associates who committed crimes to
make money for themselves and a cabinet member indicted for
carrying out policies while in office.
<p>
<a name="shaw">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>2)</FONT> After Wednesday night's debate, MRC analyst Clay Waters
noticed, CNN's Bernard Shaw concluded the post-debate analysis 
by posing this question to the audience: "I only leave you with 
this question: Is a question about character and ethics a quote 
'insult,' or an 'attack'?"
<p>
<a name="cbs">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>3)</FONT> On the bright side, the media's attitude that anything
negative or critical said of Clinton is "nasty" or "harsh," was
noted by the co-host of CBS This Morning. Thursday morning
(October 17) Jose Diaz-Balart asked CBS analyst Kevin Phillips: 
<blockquote>
"It seems like everywhere else in the world, where there is
a democracy, people are allowed to talk about the other
candidate's failures as a politician. Here, it seems, that many
in the media call that name calling and personal attacks. Are we
in the media making too much of pointing out what seemed to be
just inconsistencies in a candidate?"</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
"Good morning, everyone. The last debate of the national
political campaign is on tap for tonight in San Diego. Bob Dole
is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics.
With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly
O'Donnell is standing by live in San Diego." -- Matt Lauer
leading off his October 16 Today newscast.
<p>
"Rita, true or untrue that they're preparing for a kind of
carpet bombing on character?" -- Dan Rather to Rita Braver on
what the White House faced from Bob Dole in that night's debate,
Oct. 16 Evening News.
<p>
"Was he borrowing the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter,
or did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch in his
contest with Bill Clinton?" -- Bernard Shaw on the "Bozo"
comment, October 8 Inside Politics.
<p>
"I know that was a major goal of the Dole campaign [in the
debate], to make sure people saw this compassionate side of Bob
Dole. Do you think that he is in some ways paying the price for
a Republican Congress that enacted, or tried to enact measures,
in the views of many were simply too harsh or too draconian?" --
Katie Couric to Elizabeth Dole, October 8 Today.
<p>
"Let me just turn to the presidential campaign very quickly. As
you've heard, Tim, it turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp
yesterday. He was talking about a moral crisis. He refused to
answer a question if President Clinton was morally and ethically
capable of being President. You heard that Bozo exchange.
Effective strategy or is this going to come back to haunt him?"
-- Katie Couric to Tim Russert, Oct. 9 Today.
<p>
"In his harshest, most personal attack yet on the President, Bob
Dole today charged that the Clinton Administration is unethical,
that Bill Clinton himself is slipping and sliding away from
questions about possible illegal campaign contributions." -- NBC
reporter David Bloom, October 14 Nightly News.
<p>
"Senator Dole said he wasn't going to mention Whitewater, then
Whitewater did rear its ugly head last night." -- CBS This
Morning co-host Mark McEwen to Fred Barnes the morning after
the first debate, Oct. 7.
</blockquote>
<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Phil Jones: CBS Hatchet Man</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"He's got to explain how his campaign centerpiece, the 15
percent tax cut, can be paid for without draconian cuts in
social programs. He wants to talk about the character issue, but
he can't get personal or look mean-spirited doing it." -- Phil
Jones on what Dole needed to do in the upcoming debate, October
4 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"I think that if I had to say probably where he was the weakest
and where he really needed to score was, he needed to explain to
the American people how this country can afford that 15 percent
tax cut, the centerpiece of his campaign, without these
draconian cuts. I don't think he has done that yet." -- Reporter
Phil Jones on CBS after the October 6 debate.
<p>
"It's a tough speech for him to make because he runs the risk of
looking desperate and mean-spirited." -- Phil Jones on Dole
raising Clinton's "public ethics," October 15 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"Attacking the President could be risky for Mr. Dole because of
the debate format. The candidates will be facing voters who are
asking the questions, not a reporter. Mr. Dole has never been
able to shed that image of a hatchet man that he got back in his
1976 vice presidential debate and the last thing he needs
tonight is a boo, a hiss, or a gasp from one of the questioners
who thinks he's being too mean." -- Phil Jones, October 16 CBS
Evening News.

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Characterwise, It's Clinton Over Reagan</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"In the first two years this is a man [Clinton] who tried his
best to balance the budget, to reform health care, to fight for
gay rights, to support personal freedoms. Couldn't those be
considered doing the right things, evidence of true character?"
-- Bryant Gumbel to David Maraniss, MSNBC's InterNight, October
10.
<p>
"Lou, I know you feel as if Reagan had few, if any, character
flaws. But let me ask you this. When one sidesteps, or refuses
to acknowledge the consequences of their policies or actions,
why shouldn't that be viewed as a character flaw? Or when one
lies. For example, let me roll a clip and then we'll come back.
This one deals with Iran-Contra." -- Gumbel to Washington Post
reporter Lou Cannon, same show.
<p>
"While he appeared to be empathetic, his policies caused
enormous suffering for those who were least able to afford it?"
-- Gumbel to Cannon in discussion about Ronald Reagan, same
show.
<p>
"Elections, like actions, have consequences. Sometimes it's hard
to know what they might be. Did Americans know that electing
Ronald Reagan would send the deficit through the roof? Do we
know that electing Bob Dole would lessen drug use?" -- CNN
reporter Bruce Morton on Late Edition, September 29.

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Hateful Hunt Hates Conservatives, Loves Liberals</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"I think North Carolina is a test in the great divide in the
Republican conservative movement. There's the politics of hope
personified by Jack Kemp and there's the politics of hate
personified by Jesse Helms." -- Wall Street Journal Executive
Washington Editor Al Hunt, October 5 Capital Gang on CNN.
<p>
"Kenneth Starr, the supposedly non-partisan independent counsel
investigating the Clintons, was the featured speaker yesterday
at a luncheon sponsored by right wing hatemonger Pat Robertson
[who runs the] Christian Broadcasting Network and Regent Law
School. By pandering to Clinton-haters, Mr. Starr appears to be
abandoning all pretenses of impartiality. He went into this job
with a reputation as a fair-minded conservative. He now looks
more like a political hit man desperately eager for a future
Supreme Court appointment." -- Al Hunt's Outrage of the Week,
October 5 Capital Gang.
<p>
"Whatever you thought of Jimmy Carter as President, he has been
a great ex-President, helping to avoid bloodshed from North
Korea to Haiti, bringing health care to children in Africa and
Latin America. Even Bob Novak has lauded some of these efforts.
The outrage? The Nobel Peace prize for years has given President
Carter the back of its hand. It can make amends next week and
give him what he deserves: the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize." -- Al
Hunt, September 28 Capital Gang.

you may hear a lot about this weekend. It purports to show a
connection between women who have had abortions and the risk of
developing breast cancer. And if you see it around, remember
this. It is not original research, but an analysis of 23 earlier
studies. And the National Cancer Institute says those individual
studies were actually inconclusive, and because of that, various
other scientists say today the Penn State report is flawed." --

of Epidemiology and Community Health showing that abortion is
responsible for 5,000 cases of breast cancer each year, October

really the speech of his life, it was a very dramatic event. And
I'm standing there with one of our younger producers at MSNBC.
She's 24 or something and I said `What do you think?' She said,
`You know, he scares me.' And I said, `What do you mean he
scares you?' She said `It doesn't matter what he's trying to
say, it doesn't matter what the speech says or how well he's
doing it, all I hear him say is GET OFF MY LAWN! I have this

<title>LIUNA, Organized Crime, and the Clinton Administration - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>LIUNA, ORGANIZED CRIME, AND THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</h3>
<b>A Government Reform Project Study</b>
<p>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a><br> 
Director, Government Reform Project<br>
and August Stofferahn, Research Assistant<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 281<br>
October 20, 1996<br>
<p></center>
<font size="-1">(Updating <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip10.html"><i>Government Integrity Project Report</i> No. 10</a>, "Organized Crime, Organized Labor, and Corruption of the Federal Grants Process," July 31, 1996.)</font>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a February 1995 consent decree, the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) admitted that several of its locals and affiliates operated under the influence of organized crime. Over the past two decades, at least 80 officials of LIUNA and its affiliates have been convicted of various organized crime-related activities, including bribery, embezzlement, interstate transportation of stolen merchandise, and attempted murder. Notwithstanding this record, the Justice Department under the Clinton Administration has allowed LIUNA's leadership to remain largely in place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In hearings this summer, Congress raised questions about whether the Justice Department's treatment of LIUNA was influenced by the union's political ties to the Clinton Administration.<sup>1</sup>  After the Justice Department investigation was disclosed publicly, LIUNA significantly increased its political activity. Despite its relatively modest size, it became the largest union contributor of "soft money" to the Democratic Party, as well as the fourth-largest political action committee (PAC) contributor among all of the nation's labor unions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the first two full fiscal years under the Clinton Administration, LIUNA received nearly $30 million in federal grants. Many of these grants were awarded to LIUNA's education and training programs, a special focus of criminal investigations of the union. Congress should direct the General Accounting Office to investigate whether taxpayer funds were abused and whether government grantmakers were ignorant of, or simply chose to ignore, evidence of LIUNA's abuse of education and training funds.
<p>
<b>LIUNA's Record of Partisan Politics</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Around the time the Justice Department investigation of LIUNA became public knowledge in October 1993, the union dramatically increased its involvement in partisan politics. During the first ten months of 1993, it gave $50,600 in "soft money" donations to the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Between January and September 1996, it gave $460,000 to the DNC, making it the top soft money donor among labor unions. Although LIUNA has only one-third the membership of the National Education Association, its soft-money donations exceed the NEA's by 50 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
LIUNA's political action committee, the Laborers' Political League (LPL), has grown in influence over the same time period. The 16th-largest labor PAC in 1993-1994, the LPL has become the 4th-biggest in the 1995-1996 election cycle. Since 1993, it has donated over $2.1 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
LIUNA General President Arthur Coia also has become a leading fund-raiser for the Democratic Party. He served as co-host for a 1994 fund-raiser that brought more than $3.5 million into DNC coffers and as Vice Chairman of a May 1996 event that raised more than $12 million for the DNC. These efforts and others earned Coia the privilege of frequent access to the White House. He also has traveled with the President on numerous occasions, even accompanying him to greet the Pope in Denver.
<p>
<b>Cash-Back Bonus: Nearly $30 Million in Federal Grants in FY 1994 and 1995</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During 1994 and 1995, the first two full fiscal years of the Clinton Administration, LIUNA's largesse to the Democratic Party was reciprocated more than tenfold in the form of nearly $30 million in grants from the federal government. Such federal subsidies are especially significant to the financially strapped union, which last year ran an operating deficit of $11.8 million.3
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As detailed in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip10.html"><i>GIP Report</i> No. 10</a>, four federal agencies -- the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Department of Labor (DOL) -- awarded 38 grants totaling $11,376,000 to LIUNA and its affiliates in FY 1994 alone. Moreover, in April 1995, just two months after it signed the consent decree publicly acknowledging the influence of organized crime in its ranks, the union received a $3.5 million training and education grant from HUD.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now The Heritage Foundation has obtained copies of numerous FY 1995 grants to LIUNA and its affiliates. During FY 1995, in addition to the $3.5 million HUD grant, LIUNA and its affiliates benefited from 12 grants totaling $14,832,000 from six federal agencies: DOL, EPA, HUD, HHS, the Department of Education, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (see <a href="#app">Appendix</a>). The majority of these grants were awarded after the February 1995 LIUNA-Department of Justice consent decree had been signed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most significant among the FY 1995 grants was $9.3 million from the National Institutes of Health's Superfund Worker Training Program, awarded on September 15, 1995. This grant, nearly six times the program's average grant of $1.59 million, amounted to more than one-third of the Superfund Worker Training Program's entire $30.3 million 1995 grant budget.
<p>
<b>LIUNA's Record of Training Fund Abuses</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bulk of these 1994 and 1995 federal grants to LIUNA funded education and training programs, where much of the criminal activity in the union took place. The November 1994 complaint against LIUNA, drafted by the Department of Justice but never filed in court, alleged that "in or about 1986 to on or about July 31, 1994," LIUNA officials -- including Coia -- sought to "defraud training and education funds of various upstate locals" in New York, employing "actual and threatened force" to "induce the locals to surrender control of these funds."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, the Department of Labor's Inspector General recently hailed the conviction of one LIUNA official for conspiracy to steal union training funds.4  But despite this conviction and other government allegations, federal grants continue to flow to a group that admittedly has been infiltrated by organized crime.
<p>
<b>GAO Should Investigate LIUNA's Federal Grants</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should call upon its investigative arm, the General Accounting Office, to examine the process by which federal officials awarded such major grants to LIUNA. The GAO investigation should attempt to determine whether any of the training and education grants awarded to LIUNA and its affiliates were connected in any way to the allegations, prosecutions, or convictions against LIUNA officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
LIUNA officials have been both charged with and convicted of abusing training and education funds. The federal government provided tens of millions of dollars in training and education grants to the union. Even minimal concern about taxpayer funds would more than justify an inquiry as to whether known abuses involved the use of federal grants.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The GAO also should try to ascertain whether federal grantmakers adequately monitored the receipt and use of taxpayer funds by union officials. Relevant grantmakers at agencies that have supported LIUNA should be asked about their knowledge of allegations of criminal infiltration of LIUNA and their agencies' efforts to prevent such wrongdoing in the future. Moreover, the GAO should begin an immediate review of FY 1996 and FY 1997 grants to LIUNA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House Judiciary Committee has yet to conclude its investigation of whether LIUNA's political ties allowed it to escape harsh legal sanction from the Justice Department. It seems clear, however, that LIUNA General President Arthur Coia used his ties to the White House to seek federal grant dollars. According to an article in the May 1996 <i>Washington Monthly</i>, Coia personally lobbied the President for grant money at a fall 1994 Oval Office meeting, and the President informed Coia that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes would handle such matters.<sup>5</sup>  (Before joining the Clinton Administration, Ickes practiced labor law; LIUNA was one of his clients.<sup>6</sup>) Normally, federal grants are issued directly by agencies without White House intervention. Although White House intervention in the grants process may not be illegal, it is unusual enough to merit further GAO examination.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to examining the specifics of the LIUNA case, the GAO should recommend guidelines to help federal agencies determine how to respond properly to grant requests from organizations operating under substantial allegations of criminal wrongdoing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are focusing on a topic which
once was taboo but now is a regular part of many television
sitcoms.  It's a hot point of controversy between people who
believe there are reliable standards of right and wrong and
those who believe anything goes.

<p>

The topic is homosexuality, but the story tellers 
will not be policy experts or politicians.  You'll hear from 
former homosexuals about their life experiences.

<p>

With the AIDS quilt celebration just last week, 
many people were talking about coming out as a homosexual.
But have you ever heard of National Coming OUT OF 
Homosexuality Day?  Begun by Michael Johnston, the day is 
part of a vision of many people who have suffered because 
they believed the message, once gay, always gay.  Michael's 
perspective is especially poignant because he is slowly
dying of AIDS.

<p>

This is an important show, because it not only 
provides a viewpoint of homosexuality that other networks 
have virtually ignored; it contains vital information for 
parents struggling to understand their gay children and 
striving to find a way to talk about these tough issues.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council.  Election day is quickly 
approaching, and the candidates continue to square off on 
issue after issue. Tonight the last Presidential debate of 
this cycle will occur, and Gary discusses possible outcomes. 
Let's hear what he has to say about the race to November 5 
as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: My pleasure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There has been a lot of talk about 
how these issues need to be run in the campaign.  We've seen 
a lot of economic issues.  But it seems that the social 
issues that created great coalitions are missing in action.
What's your perspective?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think economics are important, and, 
you know, incomes have been stagnating.  We haven't had the 
job growth we should have, and those things should be 
discussed.

<p>

But I have to admit, I am furious that some of the 
most profound things facing the country -- issues about 
life, about the family, about values -- that these things 
seem to be ignored by both of the major candidates and the 
campaigns this year, and I think the American people are 
losing out.  I think we deserve a more electrifying, 
enlightening debate on some of the things that define who we 
are as Americans.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It has been interesting if you look 
at the polling data, Gary, that people are saying they are 
not going to vote.  There is a tremendous lack of voter 
interest.  In fact, we are looking at possible record lows 
in participation. What do you think will capture voter 
interest?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I sure see a link between the 
lack of voter interest and the fact that there has not been 
any passion in this campaign.  And you're right; there's a 
really clear trend line here.  People didn't watch the 
conventions at the same level that they've watched 
conventions in the past.

<p>

Apparently, the first debate, the viewer audience 
was off at least 20 percent. I don't have any reason to 
believe that the debate tonight or the one later in the week 
is going to have any bigger audience.

<p>

So the American people seem to be tuning out, and 
that's strange.  I don't think they would be tuning out if 
they thought there were really profound questions on the 
table being settled.  So it's something that I think both 
parties ought to be worried about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think would capture the 
attention of the American voter?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think excitement captures 
their attention.  I think they want to see, even though the 
voters seem to say that they don't like negative 
campaigning, nonetheless, I think they do want passion.  
They want one candidate to say, Look, your vision for 
America is wrong.  You've done this, this, this, and this.  
Here's what I want to do.  Here's what I believe about the 
American family.  Here's how I can make our streets safer, 
our schools work, protect the handicapped, our unborn 
children, and so forth.

<p>

I think if you could get a discussion on those 
things, the American people would tune out from some of the 
other stations they're watching, the sports events and so 
forth, and tune in to a very important debate about the kind 
of country we are.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In terms of campaign themes, Bob 
Dole seems to have two:  I'm going to cut your taxes and 
Bill Clinton is a liberal.  But "liberal" seems a little 
undefined.  How can we clarify what that means?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, both those themes are good 
themes from Bob Dole's standpoint.  Here's his problem.  On 
the tax cut theme, he is urging a tax cut after two 
betrayals that the American people have experienced.  First 
they watched George Bush say, "Read my lips," and they 
watched that promise go down the drain.  And then fresh in 
their minds is the fact that Bill Clinton promised a middle-class 
tax cut four years ago, and once again, we got a tax increase.

<p>

So you can't be angry at Americans for listening 
to Bob Dole and saying to themselves, "Oh, yeah, here's 
another guy who says he's going to cut our taxes; I don't 
believe it."  So there's a credibility problem there.

<p>

Quite frankly, if I were Bob Dole, I would say, 
"Look, elect me President, give me a Republican Congress, 
and if I don't lower your taxes in one year, I'll resign."
That would deal with the credibility issue, and that would 
get the attention of the American people.

<p>

On the other issue of accusing Clinton of being a 
liberal, he is a liberal.  Unfortunately, Bob Dole is 
leaving out half the issues that define his liberalism.  He 
is not reminding them of the five executive orders that 
Clinton signed on abortion the first day he was in office.
I mean, here's a President that says he's basically a 
moderate in this issue; he's an extremist on that issue.

<p>

It was really the cultural and social issues that 
Republicans used in the past to label Democratic candidates 
as being liberal or extreme, and at least as of now, the 
Republican campaign has not done that this year, and I think 
as a result, they are not getting the so-called Reagan 
Democrats to vote for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that was very interesting, 
Gary, during the debate was when Bob Dole turns to Bill 
Clinton and says that he had promised not to bring up 
Whitewater. It seems a strange thing to make a promise 
about. Did you find that odd?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Yeah, gee, when did that happen?  I 
mean, when did they have that private meeting where Bob Dole 
agreed to take off of the table one of the biggest 
vulnerabilities that Bill Clinton has?  I was astonished.  I 
was shocked by it.  I was also surprised that the media 
didn't pick up on it.  It seems to me that in that one 
little exchange, Bob Dole told us about something that no 
one knew about before, that there had been some sort of a 
conversation between him and the President where he agreed 
to let the President off the hook.

<p>

Now, I am interested in what the President did in 
exchange for that. It couldn't be not to label Dole as an 
extremist. The Clinton campaign does that all the time.  It 
couldn't be to no longer make older people fearful because 
Bob Dole is going to take away their Medicare.  Bill Clinton 
does that all the time.  So what did Bob Dole get for this 
promise not to bring up the greatest vulnerability that Bill 
Clinton has?  I'm afraid he didn't get anything, and as a 
result, we are all losing as a result of that for not 
hearing that issue being debated.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Another issue which came up during 
the debates was the issue of whether or not Bill Clinton 
will do a Presidential pardon for friends, former business 
partners, and possibly people who joined with him, 
allegedly, in criminal activity.  This is all being 
determined. The President has absolute power to pardon 
anyone he wants and seems to be dangling this over the heads 
of former friends.

<p>

The pardon issue has a lot of power, potentially.
What do you make of that?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I don't know what to make of it.  It 
was clear when the question was raised that Bill Clinton 
refused to eliminate the possibility of pardons.  We may 
have a Presidential first here, because some of the pardons 
we're talking about could extend to family members of the 
President.

<p>

So again, this is an important issue.  If I were 
Bob Dole, I would be hitting the President every day on 
this:  Will you promise the American people to not use your 
Presidential powers to thwart justice, to thwart the logical 
outcome of the cases that are pending in the Whitewater 
investigation?  I think it is a mistake to not press the 
President on that issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Last question for you, Gary.  Where 
do the campaigns go from here?  It's clear that, so far for 
voters, it has been a very lackluster exchange.  What can 
they do to change that?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, there are only a 
couple of times in a campaign where a candidate gets the 
chance to let the American people see him or her without the 
filter of the media.  One is your acceptance speech at the 
convention. The other is these debates.  There is only one 
more Presidential debate left.  This one is going to be a 
town hall forum, where Bill Clinton tends to shine.

<p>

I would hope that Bob Dole, in that last 
opportunity before the American people, will without 
hesitation define Bill Clinton as a liberal across the board 
on economic issues, on the size of government, on how 
high taxes should be, and on the important social issues.
If he does that, we are going to have a much closer election 
than anybody thinks.  If he doesn't do it, then I am afraid 
Bill Clinton is going to have four more years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll 
introduce you to a man who is dying of AIDS; yet he brings a 
story of hope to those struggling in a homosexual lifestyle. 
You will not want to miss his story and the amazing stories 
of others who have come out of homosexuality.  Please stay 
tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, held October 
11, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Today and today's observance is 
critical for this country.  It is critical for the youth of 
our country, and it is critical for the moral foundations of 
our society.

<p>

For 10 years we have been experiencing an 
onslaught of deception and lies coming from organizations 
like National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Human Rights 
Campaign, PFLAG, which is Parents and Friends of Lesbians 
and Gays -- which they're not, by the way -- and other 
organizations that have no hesitancy to absolutely lie about 
the information they put out and are drenching in hypocrisy.

<p>

One of the most intolerant groups in this country 
are homosexual activists.  They tolerate only those who want 
to accept and approve and promote homosexuality.

<p>

We have a little bit different message today.
It's not really political; it is a message of hope and a 
message of warning -- a message of warning to the American 
public and to our young people that involvement in 
homosexuality can kill you.  It can kill you emotionally, it 
can kill you physically, and it can certainly kill you 
spiritually.

<p>

The consequences of homosexuality, I think, are 
best shown by the event going on behind us today:  the AIDS 
quilt.  We are here today, and as an individual with AIDS, I 
grieve for those looking at the AIDS quilt today, 
homosexuals and heterosexuals alike, family members, wives, 
brothers and sisters.  But what I really grieve as well is 
that there is an effort in this country to promote a 
behavior that is responsible for a huge percentage of those 
panels on that quilt today.

<p>

How is a country that has any morality left, how 
can it possibly promote to our young people a behavior that 
causes so much tragedy, so much pain, and so much death?

<p>

[Conclusion of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Michael, you have been involved for 
many years reaching out to homosexuals and working with 
former homosexuals.  What gave you the courage and the 
interest to reach out to them?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Well, the passion really came from 
my own experience and struggle with homosexuality.  I was 
introduced to homosexuality by a peer friend of mine, 
actually about a year older, (who) asked me if I wanted to 
go to a disco one night.  Like most young people, I was 
looking for a place to fit in, a sense of acceptance from 
others.  I had been fairly shy all my life, and so this 
opportunity to fit in with the "in" crowd was something that 
I was excited about.  So without even thinking about it, I 
said, "Sure, I'll go."

<p>

That night, however, he placed his hand on my leg 
and he said, "It's a gay bar.  Do you mind?"  Well, I didn't 
think twice about it.  I wish I had.  It was one of the 
worst decisions I made in my life, and I ended up going into 
a homosexual disco that night, and from a human experience, 
it was probably one of the most exciting experiences I had 
had up to that point in my life.  The lights were blaring, 
the music was playing, there was a lot of camaraderie and 
closeness going on, and I liked that.  And that night he 
first introduced me to my first homosexual experience, and I 
remained in the homosexual community for just under 13 years 
and even remained in it for two years after I tested 
positive for HIV back in 1986.

<p>

My relationship and my experience coming out of 
homosexuality has less to do with homosexuality than it does 
about my personal faith in Jesus Christ and my relationship 
with Him.  And so my passion is, as I sit here dying slowly 
from AIDS, I don't want to see the young people in this 
country go through what I have gone through.

<p>

When I came out of homosexuality, I thought I was 
the only person this had ever happened to.  I want young 
people to know that there are others who have struggled with 
it. There are others out there that are willing to help 
them, and not just young people but men and women, some of 
them who have been in the homosexual subculture for many, 
many years, that there is hope for them, that their lives 
don't have to be full of despair.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things, though, that 
people talk about with homosexuality is that once gay, 
always gay.  Did you receive that message while you were in 
the community?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Sure. Now, of course, as I was 
growing up in this country, there was still a sense of shame 
associated with homosexual behavior.  To a large extent, 
that shame has dropped in this culture.  We have done away 
with a lot of our sodomy laws, and today it is fashionable, 
particularly if you look at the young people graduating from 
high school, they are coming out of high school believing 
that homosexuality is just something cool, just something 
you can experiment with.  It's a life-changing decision, and 
it very often can lead to an individual's death.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: From your own experience, did you 
feel once gay, always gay, was accurate?  Did you feel 
trapped in your lifestyle?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: I went back and forth. I did do 
some reading as I was struggling with this.  I, of course, 
as a Christian, knew deep in my soul that something was 
wrong.  I didn't know why God didn't seem to be changing me. 
I didn't know what to do about it.

<p>

As I grew up as young Christian, in my family, we 
didn't use the Word of God as a basis for truth.  We must 
have some objective truth in our lives, as a country and as 
individuals.  Otherwise, we end up with moral anarchy.
Well, that was what was happening in my heart, was personal 
moral anarchy.  I had no basis on which to make my life 
decisions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Michael, you are the national 
chairman of National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, which 
you designed to coincide with the AIDS quilt and with 
National Coming Out Day, which is very popular with 
homosexual activists, and they encourage people to come out 
and say to the world, "Yes, I am gay."

<p>

Do you think that is a good idea to affiliate 
yourself with that message?  Is coming out as a homosexual 
something people should do?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: You mean as an individual, for them to come out?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: You know, really, when you think 
about it -- let me just be blunt here -- when an individual 
"comes out" and proclaims their homosexuality, really, what 
they are doing is standing up and saying, "I'm a sexual 
deviant, and I'm proud of it."  That's what we're really 
talking about.  Homosexuality, up until the last decade, I 
would say, was still considered to be deviant human 
behavior, certainly because of religious reasons but also 
because of the consequences of the behavior itself.  It's a 
terribly tragic medical consequence of those who involve 
themselves in it.

<p>

The tragedy, though, I think is most keen when we 
look at our children.  It is not uncommon for a young person 
who is going through adolescence to struggle with a sense of 
who they are, to struggle with their sexuality.  I think we 
can all remember doing that.  And certainly as homosexuality 
is held out more and more as an option, I think more and 
more children will deal with it.

<p>

But for organizations like PFLAG and the National 
Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Human Rights Campaign, all pro-
homosexual activist groups, to tell a child that if they 
have even ever had a thought in that direction, that they 
ought to come out of the closet, as they say, and proclaim 
their homosexuality, will destroy many of those young 
people's lives.

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, held October 11, 
1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. CHRIS JOHNSON: I come to you this morning 
with some very important news -- how detrimental the 
homosexual lifestyle can be.  I come to expose myths that we 
were born this way, that once a homosexual, always a 
homosexual. I come to you as a witness, one who lived in 
this lifestyle for over 10 years of my life.  Actually, it 
became a death style. Slowly I was dying spiritually, 
mentally, and also physically.  I was involved in alcohol 
and drugs so deeply, this was ingrained within me, because 
that was the lifestyle, to constantly stay high, not be 
aware or conscious of actually how hurt one really was in 
this lifestyle.

<p>

There was no fulfillment internally, spiritually. 
It was a constant trying to find satisfaction in another 
male in physical terms.  But that could never satisfy the 
deep need that was on the inside.  It was so much hurt and 
bitterness that I had seen within this lifestyle.  But I 
knew that only God, that only God could actually change me, 
that I could not change myself, for the Word of God says, 
what is impossible with man is possible with God.

<p>

And, yes, it was impossible for me, of my own 
power, to walk out of this lifestyle, and one cannot do it 
within his own power.  But with the power of God, one can 
walk out of this lifestyle.

<p>

Recently, I guess about five years ago, I was 
tested as being HIV positive, also.  At this particular 
time, I thought that my life was over.  But God had still 
given me promises in my life and said that one day I would 
have a wife and have a family.  So I stand now married, 
having two children.  My children are HIV negative as well 
as my wife is HIV negative.

<p>

So I come to give you hope and to bring you truth, 
that just because you may be in the homosexual lifestyle 
today, you do not have to stay in this lifestyle.  God has 
given you a choice that if you believe His Word, you can 
walk out of this lifestyle and you can have a more 
fulfilling life.  Jesus says that He comes that you may have 
life and have it more abundantly.

<p>

I am a witness that it is much more of an abundant 
life that I live today than I could even imagine when I was 
living in the homosexual lifestyle.

<p>

[Conclusion of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What has been the impact so far of 
National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: I think the first impact, and 
probably the most important in my view, is that it will and 
has already begun to provide a sense of support and 
encouragement to the many men and women who are actively 
struggling to walk away from homosexuality.

<p>

I think, as I mentioned earlier, when it happened 
to me, I thought I was the only one out there.  It really is 
the best-kept secret around, that there's thousands of us 
across the country who have successfully walked away.

<p>

I think, also, it will and already has begun to 
educate the American public that this is not just a 
personality issue; this is a specific behavior with specific 
consequences, and very often detrimental not only to the 
individual involved but to society as a whole.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As an outsider looking in, Michael, 
it seems that there's a lot of hostility directed toward you 
from homosexual activists and even from the media.  Has that 
been your experience?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Yes, and you know why?  I think 
they are afraid of the truth, because if there is something 
spiritually sinful about homosexuality, then many of these 
same individuals must also have some kind of sin in their 
lives, and they don't want to confront that.  No human being 
does.

<p>

We know there is a God. At least we know there is 
a God. The Bible says that He has made Himself known by the 
things that are.  But if we acknowledge too much about God, 
then we have to acknowledge our sinfulness before Him, and 
then we've got to deal with it, and that means going to the 
cross, the cross where Jesus Christ hung, spilled His blood, 
and paid for our sins, all of us, and some folks just don't 
want to deal with that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a man who is dying from AIDS 
today, what hope, Michael, do you have for the people who 
are listening to us?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: The hope is a Person.  His name is 
Jesus Christ.  He is not just a religious figure.  He is the 
Son of God.  He is God Incarnate.  And that is the hope of 
mankind, whether we are talking about homosexuality or all 
of the other evils and wickedness that plague humanity.  He 
is the hope.

<p>

An increased economy is not a hope.  Quite 
frankly, we've got a lot of moral reprobates in the 
Republican and Democratic Party.  I am not looking there for 
hope.  They don't have the answers.  Bill Clinton doesn't 
have the answers.  Quite frankly, I am not sure Bob Dole has 
the answers.

<p>

But God does.  He knows what the problems are.  He 
knows the longing in our heart to be loved.  And the 
wonderful thing about God is He knows me better than I even 
know myself.  He knows the ugly that I haven't even seen 
yet, and I will be frank with you, I have seen a lot of ugly 
in my heart, a lot of darkness.  But He loves me, anyway.  
That is something that homosexual relationships can never 
provide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This year was the second annual 
National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, and I know you 
worked long and hard on it, Michael.  How can people get 
involved for the third annual Coming OUT OF Homosexuality 
Day?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: They can call us at Kerusso 
Ministries.  Do you have the number?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: All right. It is area code 757 
872-8878, and we're modern, so we have an e-mail address.
If they have e-mail, they can contact us at 
KERUSSOMIN@AOL.COM, and we will be glad to get the
information to them.

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality 
Day, held October 11, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. BOYER: I am a former lesbian, and I am a 
representative and a board member with Exodus, which is a 
worldwide coalition reaching out to those who desire freedom 
from the gay life.  This is a global movement where 
thousands are walking out of the gay life.

<p>

[End of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jane, how long have you been 
involved in ex-gay ministries?

<p>

MS. BOYER: I have been involved for about eight 
or nine years.  It all began when I attended my first Exodus 
conference in 1989 looking for an answer because I was 
dealing with homosexuality.

<p>

I had heard for a number of years that I was born 
gay and that there was no hope for change, and then I found 
out about Exodus, and so my car was packed and I was heading 
down to my first conference with Exodus in Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So you went to your first conference 
while you were still in the lifestyle just to see what you 
would see.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Yes. My life was in crisis at that 
time.  I had lived a double life.  I have been a Christian 
now since I was age 5, but about halfway through my 
marriage, I fell into lesbian relationships, and I lived the 
gay life, lived a double life, for about five years.

<p>

Towards the end of that, though, my husband found 
out and I was faced with making some of the most difficult 
decisions that I have ever had to make, and that is, I was 
faced with should I leave my husband, who is a fine 
Christian man but whom I had no desire for at that time, and 
leave my lesbian lover, whom I felt I could not live 
without.  I also had to decide between the gay community, 
which gave me much support and acceptance, and the church, 
which I felt was very cold and detached.

<p>

And so at that time, I hit bottom.  I was very 
depressed and I felt hopeless.  I was in despair, and I even 
contemplated suicide because there just seemed to be no hope 
for change and no hope for my marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of people watching have a 
difficult time understanding how you would get involved with 
a homosexual lifestyle.  How did that transpire for you?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Well, if you were to talk about what 
causes homosexuality, homosexuality is not inborn; 
homosexuality is caused by emotional wounding as a child, 
and the research is very clear about that.  My background 
was very dysfunctional.  I had been abused sexually and 
physically, and I had grown to develop quite a hatred for 
men.  Just line them up against the wall, and I will shoot 
them all and let God sort them out, thank you.

<p>

But God has really changed my heart.  I mean, I 
really love men today.  I love being around them, and I have 
close, healthy relationships with other men, and my husband 
is my best friend.  I mean, God has really healed our 
marriage.  We have been married 18 years now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Wow! So you were struggling with 
kind of a hatred for men, which is very typical of a lesbian 
experience.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Yes, it is.  In fact, the work that I 
do now, I run a support group.  I am founder and director of 
Amazing Grace in Portland, Maine, which is an affiliate of 
Exodus.  Our purpose is to reach out to those who desire 
freedom from homosexuality and other forms of sexual 
brokenness such as cross-dressing, transsexuality, 
pedophilia, and sex addiction.

<p>

The men and women that are coming to Amazing 
Grace, they are all born-again believers, they are all 
Christians.  We haven't even tapped into the gay community 
at this point in time.  But my point being is that even 
though we are born-again Christians, it doesn't mean that at 
the moment of salvation that all of our hurts just magically 
go away.  So it is a process.  It is a process of healing.

<p>

The women that I work with, I have never known a 
lesbian who has not been hurt and wounded by a man some 
period in her life, whether it be sexual abuse, physical 
abuse, which causes her to shut down in fear towards any 
relationship with a man.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There has been a lot of media 
attention on the sitcom Ellen and whether that character 
will come out as a lesbian.  One has to wonder whether a 
sitcom is really going to portray the homosexual lifestyle 
accurately, whether we are going to see a very upbeat 
picture.  What is the reality of the homosexual and lesbian 
lifestyle?

<p>

MS. BOYER: You know, I have been accused of being 
homophobic and what have you, but in areas that are most 
accepting of homosexuality, such as Hollywood and San 
Francisco and New York, there is the highest percentage of 
suicide, death from chemical dependency, drug addiction, 
alcoholism, and HIV amongst the gay community, and I am 
concerned about that, because I love the homosexual.
Obviously, in those areas that they are receiving the 
greatest acceptance, there is the highest percentage of 
death and despair amongst the gay community.

<p>

So in regard to your question, the show, I am 
sure, will not portray the reality of the gay life. It is 
portrayed as being wonderful and pleasurable and whatever, 
but it is not that way in real life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jane, how difficult was it for you 
to leave the lesbian lifestyle?

<p>

MS. BOYER: It was one of the most difficult 
decisions that I have ever had to made.  My decision to 
leave the gay community was not based on what I wanted; it 
was based on what God wanted.  God was very clear to me in 
telling me that I was called to a radical obedience, radical 
to His Word, radical to His will in my life, radical to His 
calling, regardless of how I felt.

<p>

I did not want to leave this woman that I was 
involved with.  I did not want to leave the gay life.  These 
were my gay friends.  These were my whole life.  The gay 
life was my whole life.  The gay community was my social 
life.  That was my identity, and God was telling me to give 
it up.

<p>

I remember wrestling with God and saying, "God, 
but don't you know that this is the best thing I have ever 
known, and don't you know that the environment that I was 
raised, there was not a whole lot of love, not a whole lot 
of acceptance, and this is the best love that I have ever 
known?"  But God was calling me to a radical obedience.

<p>

What happened at that time is that I made the 
decision to leave the gay community but not knowing for sure 
if He could fill the hurts, that emptiness, that longing to 
be loved that I had carried around my whole life, and Jesus 
touched my heart in a way that I had never known, and His 
love began to flow into my heart in those places that were 
empty, and I began to realize that lesbian love is a 
counterfeit, it's a lie, and we are far too easily pleased 
with a counterfeit.  And that is what the gay community -- 
that is the deception, is that when they turn to homosexual 
behavior, when they turn to these gay relationships, it 
doesn't fill.  It gives the illusion of being satisfying.  
But it really doesn't.  It really doesn't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think it is possible for 
someone struggling with their feelings of homosexuality to 
leave that lifestyle without a faith experience?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Absolutely. It entails, though -- it 
is much like coming out of the disease of alcoholism.  I 
also work in the field of chemical dependency, and it 
entails a twofold process.  It involves putting down the 
booze and then working through those issues, the root 
issues, the hurts, the brokenness, the broken relationships, 
the self-hatred, the bitterness.  All of those things need 
to be dealt with in order to deal with the whole concept of 
alcoholism.

<p>

The same thing with homosexuality.  In order to 
come out of homosexuality, you make the commitment, you make 
the decision that you are going to leave this way of life, 
that you are not going to turn to homosexual behavior.  It 
is sin.  And then we allow Jesus to encounter the hurts with 
His love, His grace, and His mercy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You are a counselor now, Jane.  When 
someone comes to you and they are struggling with 
homosexuality, what are their greatest fears?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Their greatest fears are that their 
feelings will never go away.  The other is that, what if God 
never changes me?  What if I never know intimacy with Jesus 
Christ because it has not worked before?  And so part of the 
process there is identifying the blocks that keep Jesus out.

<p>

What happens is that in a dysfunctional 
environment where there may be chemical dependency, there is 
abuse or whatever, a little child will look to the father, 
and the father is like God to this little child.  Dad is 
all-powerful, Dad is all-knowing, Dad is the authoritative 
word.  And so, based on our relationships with our fathers, 
we perceive God.  So if Dad was not the giver of good 
things, then we perceive that God is not the giver of good 
things.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: For someone who is watching this 
show and may be struggling with homosexual feelings or even 
be in the lifestyle, what is the first step toward getting 
free?

<p>

MS. BOYER: To realize that there is hope for 
change. It is a painful process.  It is not an easy 
process. This is not a quick fix.  And it entails 
commitment to Jesus Christ, it entails commitment to His 
Word, and it also entails allowing Him to encounter the 
hurts with His love and His grace.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There is a lot of attention paid in 
ex-gay ministry to men and to males leaving homosexuality, 
and in fact a lot of the leaders in ex-gay ministry are men. 
Some of the research would indicate that it is actually 
tougher for women to leave the lifestyle, which is why there 
aren't as many women up front.  Would you agree that it is 
harder for women to leave the lesbian lifestyle?

<p>

MS. BOYER: It is difficult in the sense that male 
homosexuality often entails sexual addictive-compulsive 
behaviors, where there are one-night encounters, that kind 
of thing.  But with women, it is a whole different thing.  
It is much more an emotional enmeshment that is very, very 
difficult to break, because when two women come together in 
this kind of relationship, you are both broken people in a 
lot of pain, in need to be loved and accepted, a lack of 
identity, a lack of self-worth, and then you come together 
enmeshed, and you see the other person as survival.  You see 
this person as vital to your survival.

<p>

What I do is, when I am talking to two women who 
are involved, I would not initially tell them that they have 
to break off the relationship.  I help them first identify 
the hurts that they are dealing with.  Eventually, as time 
goes on, they begin to let go of the relationship.

<p>

But it is much like grieving the loss of a loved 
one.  There is a process where you grieve, you allow the 
feelings to come up, you get to a point where you accept the 
fact that the person is no longer coming back, or maybe 
through divorce or whatever.  This is much the same way.

<p>

When someone breaks off in a relationship, it is a 
very, very painful process.  And unless you are willing to 
go through this process with them, we need to leave them 
alone and refer them to someone who is willing to go through 
that process with them.

<p>

So it is more than just saying to two women, no 
more contact and you need to cut it off.  It is a process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's the nature of the bond.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Exactly.  It is a very difficult bond 
to break, and it does take time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are international ministries 
that reach out to homosexuals and are a support system for 
homosexuals.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you tell us about them?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Well, Exodus is a worldwide coalition 
of Christian organizations reaching out to those who desire 
freedom from homosexuality.  Once a year they hold a 
national conference whereas 500, 600 people attend.  These 
people come from all over the country, around the world, 
proclaiming freedom from homosexuality.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you Robert 
Knight, FRC's Director of Cultural Studies.  Over the years, 
Bob has presented the often unpopular facts about 
homosexuality and the destruction it brings to individuals, 
families, and society.

<p>

Bob has been accused of hatemongering and called 
many names.  But the truth about Bob's perspective could be 
seen at a press conference opening the second annual 
National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day.  Let's take a 
look.

<p>

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality 
Day Press Conference, held October 10, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: First, I would like to thank Michael 
Johnston for organizing this event.  Michael, as you have 
seen, is a man of great courage and integrity.  He is a 
great personal friend, and I grieve with him and his parents 
as we watch him struggle with this deadly disease that has 
invaded his body.

<p>

But I thank God that he has the courage to say the 
things he does in order that others may not fall into that 
path and suffer the same consequences.  A lot of people 
aren't willing to do that, and you can see the tragedy 
unfold.  You can just wander down to the Mall and look at 
that AIDS quilt.

<p>

For Family Research Council, our concern is the 
same as Michael's, that the facts aren't getting out about 
this vital issue affecting all Americans.  You only hear one 
side normally, and that is the mantra of tolerance, of 
acceptance.

<p>

But you have to wonder what we are being asked to 
accept.  If being asked to accept more of the kind of 
behavior that has made that AIDS quilt possible is what we 
are being asked to accept, that is unacceptable.

<p>

When the facts are known, most people turn from 
homosexuality and reject it in terms of support.  It is not 
easy for those struggling with these desires.  But I think 
one of the bigger lies that is told about the lifestyle is 
that somehow homosexuals are different from the rest of us, 
that they have an exemption from the responsibility to live 
by the rules of nature and nature's God that the rest of us 
have.

<p>

Well, the good news is that homosexuals really are 
no different from anybody else, and they have the same 
chance for salvation as anybody.  Everybody struggles with 
lusts and temptations.  The idea of a sexual orientation 
without sexual behavior is a patent absurdity, because we 
are concerned about the behavior.  We are concerned about 
the consequences of that behavior, and not just physical but 
the emotional consequences, the effect on people's families.

<p>

This whole idea that what you do sexually is only 
your own business is another great myth, because it does 
affect other people.  Everybody with children knows that if 
the kids go out and you don't know where they are until 2 in 
the morning, you can bet that affects you deeply.  It isn't 
just them.

<p>

The idea that once you're gay, you're always gay, 
is the mantra of the gay rights movement.  You're born that 
way.  Genetic studies allege to show that there is a genetic 
component to homosexuality.

<p>

All too often we have seen the media -- and I am 
not criticizing anybody in particular here -- rush to accept 
these studies without critical analysis.  But even a cursory 
glance at these studies for a genetic basis for 
homosexuality reveals that you can drive a truck through 
them.  They have terrific holes.  Reputable scientists in 
major scientific journals have discredited them and said 
that whatever they show, it isn't a genetic cause for 
homosexuality.

<p>

I would like to see that reported, because a lot 
of people struggling with homosexuality, particularly young 
people in their teens, raging with hormones, wondering who 
they are, shouldn't be told that they are inescapably gay 
just because they have had some thoughts in that direction.

<p>

We have seen a major movement into America's 
schools with the message that homosexuality has to be 
affirmed because we have to conquer homophobia.  Gay 
students have to be singled out and affirmed in their 
sexuality lest they get suicidal.  This is recruitment, 
plain and simple.  It is a way of shepherding people into a 
death style.  It has got to stop, and I think Americans will 
stop it if they get the facts about it.

<p>

I think most Americans are not aware of how heavy 
the propaganda is in America's schools.  We are now seeing 
it on America's television programs.  In Los Angeles 
magazine two months ago, a gay writer bragged that virtually 
all situation comedies on television are written, produced, 
and directed by homosexuals, who do have an agenda, and it 
goes beyond just leave us alone, just tolerate what we do.  
It is to force acceptance of this lifestyle, this death 
style, on the rest of America.

<p>

What is the gay attitude that they are projecting 
through these television shows?  According to the gay 
writer, it is an ironic detachment from anything else going 
on in the programs; in other words, the outsider's point of 
view.  It is also a heavy dose of sexuality and sexual 
innuendo.

<p>

I don't think I am the only person in America who 
has noticed that American situation comedies are just 
drenched with sexuality and of a type that smacks of the gay 
lifestyle.  It all has to do with casual sex, hit-and-run 
sex, lusting after bodies instead of hearts.  It is anything 
but a healthy lifestyle that we are being sold on America's 
TV screens.

<p>

One thing Family Research Council does is try to 
present facts that you won't find in major media.  I come 
out of a media background myself.  I was an editor for the 
<i>Los Angeles Times</i> for seven years and worked for newspapers 
for 15 years on both coasts.  And I can tell you, I have 
never seen an issue treated with less objectivity than the 
homosexual rights issue. You are only getting one side out 
there, and we are here to present the other side with 
courageous people like Michael Johnston.

<p>

What we are here to do today is to bring hope.  We 
are not here to talk about policy decisions or governmental 
rules or regulations.  We are here to talk about human 
beings and human hearts that can change when they are 
presented the truth.  The truth is Jesus Christ can bring 
anybody to salvation, can heal any wound, can bring a 
wholesome, full spiritual being to anyone.  And if 
homosexuals are being told they are somehow not qualified 
for that, well, that's a lie.  They are loved by God like 
everyone else, and they deserve the same chance.  If you are 
out there struggling with homosexuality, don't believe the 
lie that you can't change.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When the <a href="http://www.npr.gov">National Performance Review</a> (NPR) was unveiled with great fanfare in September 1993, President Clinton promised to "reinvent" the federal government because "it's not just broke, it's broken."  Now, as it celebrates the NPR's third anniversary, the White House claims its reinventing efforts have saved taxpayers $118 billion and "reduced the size of the federal workforce by nearly 240,000 workers -- its smallest level in 30 years."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The reality, however, is quite different: Most government agencies remain both broke and broken. While it is true that there are fewer civilian federal workers than at any point since 1965, the NPR's purported savings (even if taken at face value) amount to shaving only one penny from every federal dollar spent. Sadly, there is little evidence to show that even these meager amounts actually accrued as real savings for American taxpayers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Over the past four years, both the tax burden on families and the level of federal spending have gone up, not down. If the Administration truly had downsized the government, taxpayers would have reaped a tax windfall and Uncle Sam would have spent proportionately less. But instead of realizing a smaller budget from these savings, Washington will spend nearly $190 billion more this year than it did in 1992, George Bush's last year in office -- a 14 percent increase.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, the elimination of some 240,000 positions in the federal workforce has been achieved without terminating one major agency. The reason is simple: 75 percent of these reductions were in national defense-related civilian positions. Today, Washington is simply spending more taxpayer money with fewer workers. Spending per government worker has jumped 30 percent since 1993. This is hardly the kind of efficiency taxpayers might expect from a government the President says should work better and cost less.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NPR's reinvention efforts have done little to cure the widespread cancer of waste and mismanagement throughout the government. Dozens of reports issued recently by such official "watchdogs" as the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) and various agency Inspectors General (IGs) confirm that the Clinton Administration has failed to address the most serious problems in government agencies: severe financial mismanagement, lack of management accountability, widespread program duplication and fragmentation, poor stewardship of government assets, and the ability of programs to survive long after they have become obsolete.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Financial Weaknesses.</b> GAO and Inspector General audits have "identified hundreds of billions of dollars of accounting errors -- mistakes and omissions that can render information provided to managers and the Congress virtually useless."<sup>2</sup>  Even at the Internal Revenue Service, some $1.4 trillion in total revenue and $122 billion in tax refunds cannot be verified or reconciled; nor can the IRS substantiate the amounts reported for taxes collected (including Social Security, income, and excise taxes).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Management Weaknesses.</b> The Department of Housing and Urban Development's own Inspector General found that HUD never completed its 1993 reorganization plan and that, because of HUD's continuing resource management weaknesses, there is little assurance that its $1 billion annual salaries and expenses budget is used either efficiently or effectively to further the agency's mission and minimize program risks.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Federal Dinosaurs Saved from Extinction.</b> The Rural Electrification Administration was created in 1935 to help local utility companies bring electricity to rural areas. In 1949, REA's mission was expanded, with the assistance of Congress, to provide loans to rural telephone companies. REA continues today as part of the new Rural Utilities Service created by the Clinton Administration and the 103rd Congress. The new agency will give grants and loans to improve rural water and sewer service as well.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Rampant Duplication.</b> The Department of Commerce shares its mission with at least 71 other federal departments, agencies, and offices; for example, export promotion programs are fragmented among 19 agencies. "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Poor Stewardship of Federal Assets.</b> According to many sources, the known environmental cleanup costs at government-owned facilities could reach $400 billion over the next few decades; as much as $350 billion of this liability is forecast for Department of Energy facilities alone. In addition, hundreds of other government-owned physical assets, such as the National Highway System, the National Park System, dams, waterways, computer systems, and buildings, are coming dangerously close to collapse.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These examples of rampant government waste and inefficiency have been well documented by Washington's own watchdogs. Yet while this waste and mismanagement persists, the White House has pushed an agenda of pseudo-reform designed to get media attention rather than to get to the root of government's most pressing problems. The truth is that the Administration's reinventing government program has had little material impact on the day-to-day lives of ordinary Americans. Taxpayers want real solutions for the deep problems facing the federal government. They do not want obsolete and inefficient government programs simply to waste their money more efficiently.
<p>
<b>REINVENTING GOVERNMENT BY SAVING PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The White House claim that the National Performance Review has produced the smallest government in 30 years derives from a fundamental error: The Administration wrongly equates the size of government with the size of the civilian workforce. While the number of federal workers has declined, the NPR's efforts have neither stemmed the tide of government spending nor halted the persistent waste and mismanagement that plague most federal agencies. Quite simply, Washington is just as wasteful and costly today as it was when the Administration began reinventing government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the White House released the first report of the National Performance Review (known as NPR Phase I) on September 7, 1993, Americans were told that this was a blueprint for "reinventing" government. The six-month-long effort produced over 1,200 specific recommendations intended to "make government work better and cost less."  The Administration promised that the NPR's recommendations would save $108 billion between FY 1995 and FY 1999.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

NPR Phase I savings were expected to come from five major reform initiatives. The White House claimed that the bulk of the savings ($40 billion) would come from "Streamlining the Bureaucracy Through Reengineering" by cutting the civil service by a total of 252,000 full-time equivalent positions (FTEs). About 20 percent of the expected savings was to come from "Reinventing Federal Procurement," while lesser savings would be achieved by "Reengineering Through Information Technology" and "Reducing Intergovernmental Administrative Costs."  Finally, over $36.4 billion was expected to be saved from "Changes in Individual Agencies" even though at least $8 billion of this amount was from new revenues, not spending cuts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, the Administration released NPR Phase II as a response to the serious downsizing proposals being debated within the new Republican-controlled Congress. These new initiatives were predicted to save an additional $69 billion through FY 1999, bringing the total expected savings from "reinventing government" to $177 billion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From day one, however, it was clear that even the first phase would have a minimal impact on the size and scope of the federal budget. First, the much-touted $108 billion in savings actually represented a small fraction of projected federal spending. At the time the NPR report was released, the Congressional Budget Office projected federal spending would total $8.73 trillion for fiscal years 1995-1999. Thus, the $108 billion the White House claimed it would save from reinventing government amounted to just 1.2 cents for every dollar the government was projected to spend over the five-year period.<sup>4</sup>  Adding the NPR's Phase II proposals to this formula brings the total savings on every dollar of federal spending to just two cents. Second, the White House boosted its promised savings by basing its estimates on a "baseline" projection of federal spending. A baseline assumes that federal programs will grow because of such factors as economic inflation, population expansion, and other statutory formulas; it therefore follows that small programmatic changes can alter a baseline projection considerably -- and that any "savings" calculated from such a baseline also will be overstated considerably.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of these problems, the GAO reported that it could neither confirm nor track the NPR's promised savings. When Members of Congress specifically asked the GAO to look at the Administration's Phase II estimates, the GAO said "it would be difficult or impossible to verify most of the NPR II savings estimates."<sup>5</sup>  With respect to the elusive nature of such estimates, the GAO observed that:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	All savings estimates, including those for the NPR II recommendations, are point-in-time estimates. That is, they are measurements of future anticipated savings based on the policies and economic conditions prevailing at the time the estimate is made. Once an estimate is prepared and time passes, it becomes difficult or impossible to retrace the original steps and reconstruct events in order to determine the validity of the original estimate.... [E]ven if the NPR II savings estimates could be shown to have been correct at the time, we could not effectively track for most of the proposals whether the savings estimated are being achieved.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Superficial Savings from Reinventing Government</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given the difficulty encountered by the GAO in trying to measure the accuracy of the White House's savings estimates, taxpayers and the media should be cautious in accepting at face value the latest figures claimed in the NPR's third annual report, <i>The Best Kept Secrets in Government</i>, released on September 20, 1996. The Administration claims in this report that its measures will have achieved about $118 billion in eventual savings between fiscal years 1995 and 2000.<sup>7</sup>  This total represents roughly two-thirds of the promised savings from NPR Phase I combined with roughly one-third of the expected savings from NPR Phase II.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These savings are trivial when compared to Washington's appetite for spending. Current CBO estimates put total federal spending (actual and projected) for fiscal years 1995-2000 at over $10 trillion. Thus, the Administration's "banked" savings of $118 billion will amount to just 1.2 cents for every federal dollar spent during this period. Unfortunately, even these modest savings will not accrue as actual savings for taxpayers, having disappeared instead into more government spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most misleading Administration claim is the so-called savings achieved by reducing the federal civilian workforce, which the NPR proposed to cut by 252,000 full-time equivalents (FTEs).<sup>8</sup>  In March 1994, Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994, which enacted the Administration's goal of reducing the civilian workforce but raised the number of positions to be cut to 272,000. While federal agencies are well underway in their efforts to meet this goal, these efforts have not yet led to a smaller government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
First, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 would save taxpayers $32.8 billion over five years. It is interesting to note that this estimate is 20 percent less than the amount the White House calculated would be saved by cutting 20,000 fewer FTEs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Second, the so-called savings achieved by these reductions were not dedicated to deficit reduction. Instead, Congress and the President used them to finance the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, commonly known as the 1994 crime bill. To be sure, many taxpayers would rather spend money on so-called crime prevention programs than on federal bureaucrats. However, the White House has grossly misled taxpayers by implying that this reduction in the federal workforce has saved taxpayers' money.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, though Clinton's FY 1997 budget projects the number of civilian federal workers to be the smallest since 1965, the cost of the civilian workforce continues to escalate. As Chart 1 shows, since 1993 the number of civilian FTEs has declined by 11 percent, but the total cost of the civilian workforce has increased by 4.5 percent, from $111 billion to $115 billion. The reduced costs associated with the 17 percent decline in civilian defense employment since 1993 masks an 8 percent, or $5.7 billion, increase in the costs of employing non-defense government workers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And third, the Administration rarely mentions that 75 percent of the total federal workforce reductions have come at the expense of civilian workers at the Department of Defense (DOD). According to recent testimony by an official of the General Accounting Office:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Although the workforce reductions occurred governmentwide, they were not evenly distributed among agencies. Indeed, most of the downsizing took place at DOD. [As is shown in Table 3,] DOD absorbed nearly three quarters of the FTE reductions in fiscal year 1994 and over half of the governmentwide reductions in fiscal year 1995. In fiscal year 1997, <i>DOD is expected to absorb all of the FTE reductions made that year while the non-DOD workforce is expected to increase by a net total of 0.2 percent</i>, according to the President's fiscal year 1997 budget [emphasis added].<sup>9</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the civilian workforce is the smallest it has been since 1965, the Administration should not imply -- as it often does -- that all parts of the government are smaller. While DOD's civilian workforce today is 22 percent smaller than it was in 1965, the non-DOD civilian workforce is 40 percent larger today than 30 years ago. This follows the overall shift in federal resources away from national defense toward domestic spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense spending consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy. Under Clinton's policies, defense spending has fallen to less than 17 percent of overall federal spending and roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The bottom line is that overall federal spending has continued to grow despite three years of reinventing government. Since 1992, total federal spending is up by $189 billion, almost 14 percent; and it would be much higher had defense spending not declined by $36 billion during this same period, a process that began under George Bush. Indeed, non-defense domestic spending has increased $195 billion, or 23 percent, since 1992. This spending would have been considerably higher if the 104th Congress had not forced Clinton into accepting spending bills that cut discretionary spending for the first time in 25 years and terminated some 270 programs and projects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a perverse way, the NPR has achieved its goal of making the federal workforce more efficient. When Clinton kicked off the NPR in 1993, overall federal spending amounted to roughly $653,600 per federal worker. Under the President's proposed FY 1997 budget, however, the government would spend $856,000 per federal worker, an increase of some $202,000, or 30 percent.<sup>10</sup>  This means that the typical government worker wastes 30 percent more taxpayers' dollars today than before the onset of the Administration's reform efforts.
<p>
<b>FEW NPR ACTION ITEMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the chief reasons the NPR -- especially in Phase I -- has recorded so few savings in its three-year effort to reinvent government is that few of its recommendations have been undertaken by federal agencies. While it is too early to assess the progress of NPR Phase II, the GAO's recent analysis of the Phase I successes claimed by the White House found that only 294 (24 percent) of the 1,203 original "action items necessary to implement the NPR's recommendations to make the government work better and cost less" were completed by January 1996.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, the NPR recorded a total of 380 recommendations as completed, but the GAO found that nearly one-fourth of these had yet to be completed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In some cases, the GAO noted that the agencies either modified or watered down the original recommendations to make them more achievable. In one case, for example, "The description in NPR's records for action item PROC15.03 was changed from 'train procurement officials on source selection techniques' to 'develop a course to train procurement officials.'"<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As amusing as such findings may be, the fact remains that neither of these recommendations has any substantive bearing on the size or scope of government or on the actual service delivered to taxpayers. Indeed, both of these action items are process-oriented pseudo-reforms designed by bureaucrats to benefit bureaucrats.
<p>
<b>Pseudo-Reforms, Pseudo-Results</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many of the NPR Phase I action items marked completed fall into such a category of "pseudo-reforms."  They often sound impressive, and a few may even make the bureaucracy work better for bureaucrats. But they have little substantive impact, either on the functioning of the program or on its cost to taxpayers. Indeed, the bureaucracy often invents these pseudo-reforms to divert attention from the real question of whether or not the program should exist at all. Management expert Peter Drucker has criticized the NPR on this point:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In any institution other than the federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinventions would not even be announced, except perhaps on the bulletin board in the hallway. They are the kinds of things that a hospital expects floor nurses to do on their own; that a bank manager expects branch managers to do on their own; that even a poorly-run manufacturer expects supervisors to do on their own -- without getting much praise, let alone any extra rewards.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Indeed, by focusing attention on <I>reinventing</i> government rather than <i>downsizing</i> government, the NPR unwittingly validated the process by which government workers block real reforms with pseudo-reforms and the way in which programs continually recast themselves to justify their existence. The continuous process of reinvention is how programs designed 40 or 50 years ago to address a specific problem can continue decades after the reason for their creation has passed. The fact that the NPR put so much trust in bureaucrats to reform their agencies and programs from within has contributed to this and, in some cases, has led to a reduction rather than an increase in accountability. In the end, the government may work better for bureaucrats, but not for all Americans.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The accompanying sample of completed NPR action items -- for which the White House now proudly congratulates itself -- illustrates the kind of pseudo-reforms that would not merit notice on Drucker's bulletin board.<sup>14</sup>

<p>
<b>A GOVERNMENT IN SHAMBLES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The problems facing the federal government are not trivial, and they merit serious action by the White House. Washington institutions have become monuments to the needs and priorities of the 19th century, the Great Depression, World War II, and the Great Society. No amount of "reinventing" can turn institutions that were created to address problems the nation faced 30, 50, or even 100 years ago into agencies capable of meeting the needs of Americans in the 21st century.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the Administration's effort to streamline and improve the functioning of federal agencies, severe waste and mismanagement persist throughout the government. The government's own "watchdogs," such as the General Accounting Office and various agency Inspectors General, confirm that the problems plaguing agencies include severe financial mismanagement, lack of management accountability, widespread program duplication and fragmentation, poor stewardship of government assets, and the ability of programs to survive long after they have become obsolete.
<p>
<b>Financial Weaknesses</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Bill Clinton entered the White House in 1993, the GAO warned that "widespread financial management weaknesses are crippling the ability of our leaders to effectively run the federal government.... Not only does the government do an abysmal job of rudimentary bookkeeping, but it is also far from having the modern financial systems one would expect of a superpower."<sup>15</sup>  Unfortunately, the situation has changed little since the GAO issued its report.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, the GAO and most agency Inspectors General continue to uncover vast amounts of financial mismanagement in federal agencies of all sizes, from the $570 million Corporation for National Service to the $55 billion U.S. Department of Agriculture. The problems identified range from "shortcomings in accounting and financial systems" to "material weaknesses in the internal controls for financial management that result in a lack of accurate and reliable financial information."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While taxpayers are right to be shocked by reports of widespread financial mismanagement in government, Members of Congress -- who are responsible for approving funding for federal programs -- should be no less so. Unless those responsible for administering a program can provide a full accounting of how taxpayers' money was spent in the past, Members should be hesitant to spend more taxpayers' money on that program. As the GAO reported recently:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Financial audits have also shown that agencies often do not follow rudimentary bookkeeping practices, such as reconciling their accounting records with Treasury accounts or their own subsidiary ledgers. <i>These audits have identified hundreds of billions of dollars of accounting errors -- mistakes and omissions that can render information provided to managers and the Congress virtually useless</i> [emphasis added].<sup>16</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As U.S. Comptroller General Charles Bowsher has testified to Congress, the federal government is the nation's largest single source of credit, yet lending programs cannot provide accurate and reliable data. According to Bowsher, the FY 1994 financial audit reports from the Farmers Home Administration, Federal Housing Administration, Federal Family Education Loan Program, and Small Business Administration "revealed that agencies' estimates of the subsidy costs of their credit programs reflected in the budget are not accurate. Based on these audits, budget decisionmakers know that they have reason to question the amount of future budget requests for these agencies."<sup>17</sup>  Even worse is the acknowledgment that lending agencies are not able to collect on the loans they have made or guaranteed. As of the end of FY 1994, "the government reported (1) $241 billion in nontax receivables, of which $49 billion, or 20 percent, was reported to be delinquent and (2) $694 billion in guarantees of outstanding loans for which it was contingently liable."<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In light of these serious financial management problems, the Administration incredibly proposed to reorient the mission of agency Inspectors General away from oversight and toward a more management-oriented role.<sup>19</sup>  According to Ronald C. Moe, a scholar at the Congressional Research Service and Johns Hopkins University:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The report criticizes the IGs for being overzealous in their pursuit of "waste, fraud and abuse...."  The report repeats that it is interested in results, not processes. Therefore it views IGs as a problem since they are designed to punish those who violate processes.... The answer to the problem of overzealous IGs is to reculturate them to think and act less like IGs and more like managers.20
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Implementing such a recommendation would effectively neutralize the abilities of the principal fiscal watchdogs within each agency and thereby further erode the financial accountability of government workers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To varying degrees, nearly every major federal agency suffers from some form of financial management problem. Examples of problems in the following agencies vary from a lack of qualified accounting staff to an inability to maintain accurate records.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In financial terms, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is one of the federal government's most troubled agencies. In FY 1994, the USDA spent over $60 billion, yet the agency's Inspector General was unable to express an opinion on its financial statements for the year because of system-wide weaknesses in the department's financial accounting system. Among the problems cited by the IG:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	We were unable to substantiate certain cash balances because of unsupported write-offs and adjustments. Reconciliations were not always performed appropriately and balances reported for certain Treasury symbols contained unexplained negative balances.<sup>21</sup>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	We also could not determine whether approximately $500 million in accounts receivable and $445 million in accounts payable balances were materially stated.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Sufficient, competent evidential matter was also unavailable to support the reasonableness of about $32.8 billion in "Credit Program Receivables and Related Foreclosed Property" and $485 million in "Estimated Losses on Loan Guarantees."<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	We noted inadequate documentation, pervasive instances of error and material control weaknesses when accounting for approximately $7 billion of Property, Plant and Equipment.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Department does not maintain an integrated, automated system for maintaining applicable records, existing records were not consistently updated, supporting documentation was inadequate, and capitalization rates were not consistently applied.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Food and Consumer Service (FCS) could not provide "sufficient, competent, evidential matter to fully support" about $13.5 billion in "primary grant operating/program expenses for the Child Nutrition Programs, Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Food Stamp Program Administration, and Food Donation Program."  Nor could it document "nonoperating changes stated at about $3.2 billion."<sup>26</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The General Accounting Office has also noted severe financial weaknesses in other USDA-administered programs. For example:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	At the request of Representatives John Kasich (R-OH) and Don Young (R-AK), the GAO asked the U.S. Forest Service to provide revenue and cost data for each of the national forests it manages for fiscal years 1992-1995. In FY 1995 alone, "over $1.3 billion was appropriated to manage the National Forest System, and revenue generated from the use of the forests totaled about $1.0 billion."  However, the USFS was unable to comply with the GAO's request "because of shortcomings in its accounting and financial information systems" which "does not enable the Service to associate the costs incurred in generating revenues from various forest uses."  USFS officials admitted that there were "various material weaknesses in the internal controls for financial management that result in a lack of accurate and reliable financial information...."<sup>27</sup>

</blockquote><p>

<b>Department of Commerce</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite years of stern warnings, the Commerce Department's Inspector General continues to find department-wide material weaknesses in financial management systems.<sup>28</sup>  Among the more severe problems identified by the IG:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	During our survey of BXA [the Bureau of Export Administration], we identified significant deficiencies in the internal control structure that would inhibit the agency's ability to produce accurate, reliable financial information.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	We have repeatedly reported on the inadequacies in Census' financial management practices and systems, identifying several obstacles to change: lack of senior financial managers and leadership, lack of designation of financial management as a bureau priority, and lack of qualified financial management staff.<sup>30</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The IG gave qualified (disclaimer) financial audits of the Economic Development Administration (EDA), International Trade Administration (ITA), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), "all of which have multiple material weaknesses and have shown only limited improvement."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Though the Department of Defense spends over $250 billion annually and manages over $1 trillion in assets, according to the GAO, its financial management problems are so widespread that "no single military service or major component has been able to withstand the scrutiny of a financial statement audit."<sup>32</sup>  Though DOD is developing a new accounting system, the GAO reports that this system will not be completed until the end of FY 1998. This means the year 2000 is the earliest DOD's IG could render an audit opinion on the agency's financial statement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Among the problems identified at DOD are overpayments and errors in record keeping:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As of August 1995, DOD problem disbursements -- those for which the Department can not match a disbursement with a related obligation -- were reported to be $28 billion -- and DOD continues to make hundreds of millions of dollars in overpayments to its contractors. As a result, DOD can not ensure that it does not spend more than it is authorized -- a basic fund control responsibility;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	DOD does not have adequate records or controls over the multibillion dollar investment in government furnished property and equipment;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	[T]o an even greater extent than other military services, the Navy is plagued by troublesome financial management deficiencies involving tens of billions of dollars.<sup>33</sup>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>U.S. Department of Energy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This year, the Department of Energy's Inspector General could not express an opinion on DOE's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for FY 1995 because "the audit disclosed reportable conditions in the Department's internal control structure that adversely affected its ability to manage and account for its assets and liabilities."<sup>34</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Specifically, "these weaknesses related to estimating the Department's unfunded environmental liability of $196 billion, accountability and valuation of over $23 billion in property, plant, and equipment, and the inability of the Department's financial management system to produce adjusted consolidated financial statements."<sup>35</sup>
<p>

<b>Department of the Interior</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Trust Funds Management oversees Indian trust fund accounts totaling about "$2.6 billion, including approximately $2.1 billion for about 1,500 tribal accounts and about $453 million for nearly 390,000 Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts."<sup>36</sup>  Remarkably, though some of these accounts were 50 to 100 years old, they had never been reconciled until BIA undertook this effort in 1991. According to the GAO:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	[D]espite over 5 years of effort and about $21 million in contracting fees, due to missing records, a total of $2.4 billion... could not be traced to supporting documentation and only about 10 percent of the leases selected for reconciliation could be verified.<sup>37</sup>
</blockquote><p>

<b>Department of Justice</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Department of Justice claims that one of the reasons its major bureaus, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Attorneys Office, and U.S. Marshals Service, have not been audited is the "lack of experienced staff to prepare financial statements."<sup>38</sup>  DOJ also claims it lacks the funds necessary to contract for the audits.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) is supposed to collect fees for serving legal processes. However, DOJ's Inspector General found that "none of the districts calculated fees and commission correctly" and that "over 80 percent of the districts did not collect all fees due."  Moreover, the IG "could not estimate whether the USMS was over- or under-collecting fees because 67 percent of districts did not track all information needed to perform this calculation."<sup>39</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of the Treasury</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of all the Cabinet departments, the Department of the Treasury is the one most Americans would agree should be beyond financial reproach. Unfortunately, however, Treasury manages two of the government's more financially troubled agencies -- the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Customs Service.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Internal Revenue Service.</b> As the principal agency charged with collecting revenue for the U.S. Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service has perhaps the worst financial management system in all of government. This year, as in past years, the GAO could not audit the IRS's books because of widespread financial deficiencies. Among the problems identified by the GAO:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The amounts of total revenue ($1.4 trillion) and tax refunds ($122 billion) cannot be verified or reconciled to accounting records maintained for individual taxpayers in the aggregate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The amounts reported for taxes collected (social security, income, and excise taxes, for example) cannot be substantiated.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The reliability of reported estimates of $113 billion for valid accounts receivable and $46 billion for collectible accounts receivable cannot be determined.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	A significant portion of the agency's reported $3 billion in nonpayroll operating expenses cannot be verified.<sup>40</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Customs Service.</b> Only the Internal Revenue Service collects more revenue for the federal Treasury than the U.S. Customs Service. Audits have uncovered financial management problems so severe that, according to the GAO, they "impaired Customs' ability to effectively ensure that carriers, importers, and their agents complied with laws intended to ensure fair trade practices and protect the American people from unsafe and illegal [<i>sic</i>] imported goods."<sup>41</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The GAO reported the following problems, which Customs claims it is committed to correcting. The GAO found that Customs did not:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	adequately ensure that all goods imported into the United States were properly identified and that the related duties, taxes, and fees on imports, reported to be over $21 billion for fiscal year 1993, were properly assessed and collected;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	have adequate controls to detect and prevent excessive or duplicate refund payments;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	have adequate accountability over tons of illegal drugs and millions of dollars of cash and property seized or used in its enforcement efforts....<sup>42</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Department of Veterans Affairs</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Department of Veterans Affairs' Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 could not be certified by the Inspector General because DVA's "unreliable" accounting records, procedures, and internal controls did not support the $11.4 billion reported for real property, plant, and equipment, as well as the $3.3 billion in net receivables.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
<b>Independent Agencies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Financial management problems are not limited to the major Cabinet-level agencies. Smaller, independent agencies also show a lack of financial accountability. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Corporation for National and Community Service.</b> Created in 1993, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNS) is one of the youngest agencies in the federal government. Spending some $570 million annually, it administers such programs as AmeriCorps, VISTA, and the National Civilian Community Corps.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite being such a young agency, independent auditors "found that CNS' general ledger system is outmoded and poorly designed."  The auditors informed the program's Inspector General "that due to weaknesses in CNS' financial systems, accounting records and management controls, the financial statements were unauditable."<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Environmental Protection Agency.</b> The EPA's Inspector General could not determine whether the FY 1995 Superfund Trust Fund Financial Statements were accurate because of "weaknesses in the areas of accounting for property, accounting for the components of net position, recording reimbursable Superfund oversight costs as assets," and numerous other technical problems.<sup>45</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IG could not verify the accuracy of the financial statements for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund, the Oil Spill Trust Fund, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Fund.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The IG also found material weaknesses in the Agency's property management system. "We found leases that had not been capitalized, inventories had not been completed at some locations, and some contractors did not provide reports on the value of EPA property in their possession."<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Social Security Administration.</b> The Social Security Administration's Inspector General found that the systems which generate the Agency's accounts receivable data continue to suffer material weaknesses. According to the IG, "<I>the SSA's overpayment systems cannot identify how much is owed or collected</I> [emphasis added]."<sup>47</sup>

<p>
<b>Management Weaknesses</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Performance Review argues persuasively that the industrial-age management structures employed by government agencies are no longer suited to "today's world of rapid change, lightning-quick information technologies, tough global competition, and demanding customers.... "<sup>48</sup> After all, suggests the report, "Saturn isn't run the way General Motors was. Intel isn't run the way IBM was."<sup>49</sup>  The NPR's solution to this problem is to reinvent federal agencies into "entrepreneurial organizations" with authority devolved to the lowest possible level.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As persuasive as this line of argument might be, some analysts suggest that devolving authority in government -- a politically rooted institution -- can lead to the unintended consequence of undermining presidential authority. Ronald Moe is highly critical of the NPR's entrepreneurial agenda. Moe writes that under the NPR's management theory of devolution:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	[T]he President's management responsibilities and authorities will be diminished as will be the institutional capacity of the central management agencies....  The President, in turn, is seen more as a catalytic agent than as the legal agent of a sovereign power.<sup>50</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead of increasing bureaucratic accountability, Moe argues, the NPR's agenda will reduce accountability:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The net result of the Gore Report when its recommendations are implemented to the maximum degree possible in the political realm will be a government much less accountable to the citizens for its performance. The institutional presidency and the central management agencies are being intentionally weakened in their management roles.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Indeed, most federal agencies suffer management weaknesses that result in fraud, waste, cost overruns, and no accountability for program performance.
<p>
<b>Department of Agriculture</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Roughly half of the Department of Agriculture's $55 billion per year budget is spent on one program -- the Food Stamp Program (FSP). Waste, fraud, and abuse in the Food Stamp Program has been estimated by the USDA Inspector General at $3 billion per year. Yet, according to the IG, the Food and Consumer Service (FCS), which runs the Food Stamp Program, "does not require preauthorization visits to applicant stores. After authorization, periodic visits are not made unless trafficking is suspected."  During a recent nationwide sweep of more than 5,000 stores, the IG found that one-sixth (roughly 830) clearly were not eligible for the program. Among the ineligible vendors cited were a pizza restaurant in California, a vacant store in St. Louis, and the owner of 12 ice cream trucks in South Carolina.<sup>51</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Error rates in the Food Stamp Program have escalated since 1989. According to the Department of Agriculture's Inspector General, the combined value of FSP overpayments and underpayments jumped from $1.1 billion in FY 1989 to approximately $2.3 billion in FY 1994.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All states were to have implemented the Disqualified Recipient System (DRS) by April 1994. This Food Stamp monitoring system is intended to "track individuals who have been disqualified from FSP because of intentional program violations."<sup>53</sup>  However, in 1996 the IG found that 26 states had not fully implemented the tracking system. As a result, thousands of individuals who have been disqualified in one state could apply for benefits in another state or county without being caught.
<p>
<b>Department of Commerce</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although it has the smallest budget of all the major Cabinet agencies, the Department of Commerce is a management nightmare. Even its own Inspector General admits Commerce has evolved into "a loose collection of more than 100 programs delivering services to about 1,000 customer bases."  The GAO reports that Commerce "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" by sharing its "missions with at least some 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Examples of the department's more significant management problems include:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</b> In 1992, NOAA began a $1.9 billion, 15-year plan to modernize its in-house fleet of research vessels. Since then, the Commerce Department's IG repeatedly has urged NOAA to explore more cost-effective options such as privatization. NOAA has ignored these suggestions even though the IG found that "(1) NOAA's fleet is clearly more expensive than available alternatives, (2) its decisions regarding the fleet have been based on faulty assumptions and inaccurate cost data, and (3) its actions have impeded attempts to form external partnerships with public and private sector organizations."<sup>55</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>National Weather Service (NWS).</b> For over ten years, NOAA's IG has warned repeatedly of management problems in the NWS's $4.5 billion modernization program. In a recent report, the IG focused on cost overruns and delays in just one part of the modernization program -- the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS). According to the IG, "In 1985 NOAA estimated that the [AWIPS] program would cost $350 million and be completed in 1995. As of 1995, the NOAA estimate had risen to $525 million, with a 1999 completion date. We believe that AWIPS will probably cost over $625 million and take nearly twice as long as originally planned."<sup>56</sup>  Further, the IG is "convinced that AWIPS is still dangerously schedule-driven: NOAA is attempting to develop and deploy the system much too quickly because the agency is under intense pressure to show progress."<sup>57</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Bureau of the Census.</b> The Commerce Department's IG recently questioned the readiness of the Bureau of the Census to implement the 2000 census. The IG found that "the bureau had selected a new design with questionable components" and "lacked an effective organization for planning and implementing the decennial."  The IG concluded that "the bureau's fragmented organizational and decision-making structure is not conducive to completing, substantiating, and implementing any design."<sup>58</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Energy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In response to plans by members of the 104th Congress to terminate the Department of Energy, the department embarked on its own Strategic Plan in April 1995. DOE management estimates this initiative will save about $1.7 billion over five years, a mere 2.5 percent of the $67.5 billion projected to be spent on DOE programs during the same period. DOE's management problems, especially its lax oversight of contractors, have been criticized repeatedly by the GAO and by the department's own Inspector General. GAO officials have testified that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight...."<sup>59</sup>  Specific Inspector General findings include the following:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1989, DOE has 
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	received about $10 billion for environmental restoration projects at its 130 facilities across the country. These projects are aimed at cleaning up more than 10,500 individual waste sites.... To date, much of the $10 billion has gone to study waste sites and develop an approach to their remediation, as required by environmental laws, rather than to actually clean them up.<sup>60</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Attempts to establish direct accountability among program offices at headquarters, administrative units, field offices, and the national laboratories have been especially difficult. Reporting relationships changed often and sometimes have been confusing.<sup>61</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An IG audit found that the department "spent about $29 million to design, modify and produce 87 accident resistant containers for the Air Force. However, the Air Force did not want them and expressed no desire to use these containers."  According to a GAO interview with DOE management, "this particular case was an exception in that the Department was responding to a 'sincerely felt' requirement."<sup>62</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IG discovered that "the Department allowed arms and military-type equipment to be loaned for extended periods of time even though it had established specific policies prohibiting the practice."<sup>63</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In May 1995, DOE attempted to justify its existence in the face of congressional attacks by publishing <i>Success Stories: The Energy Mission in the Market Place. Success Stories</i> highlights over 60 technologies developed or supported by DOE's applied research and development programs. This report, however, only fueled congressional criticism following a GAO analysis of 15 randomly selected "success stories."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The GAO "found problems with the analysis DOE used to support the benefits cited in 11 out of the 15 cases" it reviewed. "These problems include basic math errors, problems in the supporting economic analysis, and unsupported links between the benefits cited and DOE's role or the technology. These problems make DOE's estimates of the benefits for these cases questionable."<sup>64</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Housing and Urban Development</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has had a long and colorful history of scandal, from gross mismanagement to outright corruption. In December 1994, the Clinton Administration released HUD's "Reinvention Blueprint," intended to "improve HUD's overall program delivery structure."<sup>65</sup>  According to HUD's Inspector General, however, this blueprint and the 1993 reorganization plan that preceded it have largely failed to improve HUD's operations. The IG found that:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	HUD's 1993 reorganization was never fully completed, given that HUD's considerable headquarters resources were never reorganized, and the field office restructuring and staff reassignments were never fully carried out.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	HUD does not maintain a bottom-up budget formulation process to identify resource needs based on detailed analysis of its program roles, functions, processes and anticipated workloads.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the OIG's [Office of Inspector General's] view, resource management decisions related to HUD's reinvention proposals have been made without sufficient analysis and detailed planning to assure the feasibility and benefits of the decisions.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of HUD's continuing resource management weaknesses, there is little assurance that HUD's $1 billion annual salaries and expenses budget is efficiently and effectively used to further HUD's mission and minimize program risks.<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	HUD has only been able to accumulate rudimentary performance measure data for many of its programs.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 The need for improved HUD enforcement culture is still frequently evidenced in the lack of management action on the results of OIG audit findings of waste, abuse and funding misuse in HUD programs.<sup>67</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Department of Justice</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Justice Department's Inspector General found that the Drug Enforcement Administration's "official property records were materially misstated."  With a property inventory of 111,000 items valued at some $290 million, DEA does "not have a comprehensive, reliable property management program."<sup>68</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Transportation</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The recent resignation of DOT Inspector General Mary Schiavo because of unaddressed problems at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has drawn attention to the systemic management problems throughout the entire $39 billion agency. For instance, although the FAA employs about 5,000 people performing safety-related inspections and oversight, the IG discovered severe management weaknesses throughout the system:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	FAA's inventory acceptance procedures for aircraft parts purchased for FAA aircraft failed to detect that about 39 percent of the parts were of unknown origin and could not be traced to FAA-approved manufacturers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	FAA-established parts manufacturer approval process had been compromised, and manufacturers produced and sold replacement aircraft parts without an FAA-approved quality assurance manufacturing system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	FAA databases contained incomplete, inconsistent, and inaccurate data that does not reliably support safety-related decisions and will not effectively support FAA's inspection and certification mission.<sup>69</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In another safety-related program, the IG found that the Federal Highway Administration's "motor carrier assistance program safety inspections had limited effectiveness."<sup>70</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

DOT also has a poor track record in grant and asset management oversight. The Federal Transit Administration, for example, which gives out about $4.5 billion in grants annually, was placed on the GAO's "High-Risk" list of troubled programs because "FTA's past oversight and enforcement practices failed to protect the government from waste and mismanagement."<sup>71</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
DOT's Inspector General also has cited the FAA and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) for poor management over acquisitions and assets. According to the IG, although the FAA and USCG planned to spend $2.3 billion in FY 1996 on capital investments, both agencies 
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	have a history of inadequate mission analysis, frequently changing requirements, insufficient operational testing, inadequate contractor oversight, and poor contractor performance. Acquisition staffs have not been well-trained or highly supervised.... Problems such as inadequate specifications and testing have resulted in purchases of expensive equipment that did not satisfactorily perform its intended function.... FAA's AAS Program experienced substantial cost overruns and schedule delays. Initially estimated to cost $2.5 billion to complete, today's estimate is over $6 billion.<sup>72</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Federal Dinosaurs Saved from Extinction</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most taxpayers would be stunned to learn how old many federal programs and agencies really are. Large segments of the federal bureaucracy were created decades ago for purposes long since forgotten. One of the ways obsolete programs like the pre-World War II-era Rural Electrification Administration, the National Helium Reserves, and the Agricultural Extension Service become cemented in the federal budget is by continually reinventing themselves to "address" the needs of the day.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the numerous examples of programs evolving and adapting to ensure their survival are the following:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Rural Electrification Administration</b> was created in 1935 to help local utility companies bring electricity to rural areas. In 1949, REA's mission was expanded, with the assistance of Congress, to provide loans to rural telephone companies. REA continues today as part of the new Rural Utilities Service created by the Clinton Administration and the 103rd Congress. The new agency will give grants and loans to improve rural water and sewer service as well.

<b>The Export-Import Bank</b> was created in 1934 to finance exports to Russia. Today, the bank backs some $18 billion per year in cheap credit to major corporations such as Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas, and General Electric. In the 60 years since its creation, the Export-Import Bank has lost $8 billion on its operations -- practically all of it in the last 15 years.

<b>The National Fertilizer Development Center</b>, built as a munitions factory during World War I, was converted into a fertilizer plant and given to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the early 1930s. Fearing Congress would close it down, this obsolete program then reinvented itself and changed its name to the TVA Environmental Research Center as a way to chase federal research dollars. The 104th Congress, however, finally began taking steps to close this unnecessary program.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By focusing its efforts on <i>reinventing</i> government rather than <i>downsizing</i> government, the Clinton Administration has validated and institutionalized the evolutionary survival process of obsolete government programs. Outmoded agencies do not need to worry about being terminated as long as they create a new mission for themselves.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One such outmoded agency is the Bureau of Reclamation, established in 1902 to bring water to arid Western states through public works projects such as the Hoover and Grand Coulee dams. The power generated by Reclamation's 56 hydropower plants makes it the second-largest power producer in the nation. Now that the West has been tamed, there is a strong argument to be made for ending the Bureau of Reclamation and privatizing its facilities in the way countries from China to Chile have sold government-owned utilities to the private sector.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the Administration has modestly endorsed privatizing some of the government's power distribution enterprises, it also recommends "creating a new mission for the Bureau of Reclamation."  According to the NPR, Reclamation "needs to redefine its mission toward new environmental priorities and clarify its role in water management."<sup>73</sup>  The Administration thus is sending a clear signal to other outmoded agencies: They need never fear being closed as long as they can find new missions for themselves.
<p>
<b>Rampant Duplication</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because outmoded, obsolete, or inefficient programs rarely die, bureaus, agencies, and programs duplicate each other's functions throughout government. Government auditors, as well as analysts at the National Performance Review, have identified a staggering degree of duplication throughout the federal bureaucracy. For example, the NPR found that "much of Washington's domestic agenda, $226 billion, to be precise," is allocated to state and local governments "through an array of more than 600 different grant programs," many of which target the same populations for assistance.<sup>74</sup>  Moreover, each of these programs has strings attached that bind the hands of local officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The GAO has identified duplication and fragmentation of government functions both across and within agencies. This creates considerable confusion for potential program recipients, who often are at a loss as to which program suits their particular needs, and for policymakers who must make funding decisions based on unreliable information. For example:
<p><ul>
<li> Some 15 separate government departments and agencies spend $20 billion a year on over 160 employment and training programs.<sup>75</sup>  The GAO found, however, that "almost 40 percent of the programs could not accurately tell us how many people were served each year... and less than 50 percent of the programs collected data on whether or not participants obtained jobs after they received services."<sup>76</sup>
<p>
<li> According to the NPR, Washington spends "about $60 billion a year on the well-being of children. But we have created at least 340 separate programs for families and children administered by 11 different federal agencies and departments."<sup>77</sup>
<p>
<li> The GAO has identified 72 federal programs and initiatives managed by eight different agencies that either directly or indirectly support water quality protection and enhancement. According to agency estimates, about "$4.6 billion and 10,680 full-time equivalent staff were dedicated to efforts related to water quality in fiscal year 1995, and about $5.1 billion was requested, appropriated, or otherwise provided for these programs for fiscal year 1996."<sup>78</sup>
<p>
<li>The GAO has identified 131 programs, administered by 16 different departments and agencies, targeted to assisting "at-risk" or delinquent youth. The Department of Health and Human Services managed the majority -- 58 separate programs. The cost of these 131 programs tops $4 billion per year. According to the GAO, "our analysis showed that, in many cases, it was possible for two or more programs to provide similar services to the same target group."<sup>79</sup>
<p>
<li> "The Department of Commerce shares its mission with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<sup>80</sup>  Commerce has "14 subordinate organizations addressing missions as varied as natural resources; advancement of commerce; area and regional development; and research and general education aids."<sup>81</sup>
<p>
<li> Federal law enforcement activities are spread among five major departments and four independent agencies.<sup>82</sup>
<p>
<li>Export promotion programs are fragmented among 19 agencies. "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<sup>83</sup>  According to the GAO, "it is unclear that [USDA's] export credit guarantee programs have resulted in increased agricultural exports."<sup>84</sup>
<p>
<li> In the Department of Agriculture, as many as 12 different agencies spend over $1 billion per year to administer 35 different laws pertaining to food safety. As a result, the current food safety system suffers from overlapping and duplicative inspections, poor conditions, inefficient allocation of resources, and outdated inspection procedures.<sup>85</sup>
<p>
<li> The USDA administers 14 food assistance programs serving 39 million people annually. 
<p>
<li> The cost of these programs has skyrocketed from $664 million in FY 1967 to about $37 billion in FY 1994. According to the GAO, their complex structure has caused overlapping of benefits and functions, inconsistent administrative procedures, and confusion for applicants who attempt to access the system.<sup>86</sup>
<p>
<li> At a cost of $1 billion to $3 billion per year, some two dozen federal agencies engage in mapmaking and geographic data collection activities.
<p>
<li> There are at least 14 major federal housing programs for low-income persons. Many state governments also operate independent public housing programs. Total housing aid for these beneficiaries equaled $23.5 billion in FY 1993.
<p>
<li> The Department of Education alone manages over 240 programs, yet federal spending comprises about 6 percent of all education spending.
<p>
<li> There are at least 62 federal economic development programs under the jurisdiction of 18 different departments and agencies.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration has a mixed record in consolidating duplicative programs and functions in government agencies. The Administration has recommended consolidating programs within the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development, to name a few. However, had these consolidation proposals been enacted, the savings to taxpayers would have been minimal at best.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the most part, the Administration has displayed a zealous belief that better management and "coordination" can overcome the problems of duplication and fragmentation. NPR documents are replete with recommendations to create new programs, interagency coordinating councils, and oversight boards to overcome duplicative programs and functions. For example, the Administration created the nationwide One Stop Shopping program to help people seeking job training navigate through the maze of over 160 education training programs. A simple solution would be to eliminate these programs and use the $20 billion now spent on them each year to finance vouchers or tax credits for those seeking employment training. The Administration, however, even fought House and Senate attempts to consolidate between 75 and 100 of these job training programs into simple block grants to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many of the NPR's so-called successes include the expansion of what can be called the informal level of government, comprised of interagency councils and coordinating committees. For example:
<p><ul>
<li> The Administration created a National Spatial Data Infrastructure project to coordinate the two dozen agencies involved in mapmaking and data collection.
<p>
<li> The NPR recommended the creation of "regional ecosystem management teams for each of the cross-agency ecosystem management projects."<sup>87</sup>
<p>
<li> To "strengthen the financial management roles of OMB and Treasury," the NPR recommended the creation of "a governmentwide budget and financial information steering group."<sup>88</sup>
<p>
<li> To solve the problems caused by 19 different export programs, the NPR recommended that the "President should issue an executive order to grant the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) broader authority to control federal export promotion efforts."<sup>89</sup>
<p>
<li> To "improve the delivery of federal domestic grant programs," the NPR recommended the creation of "a Cabinet-level Enterprise Board to oversee new initiatives in community empowerment."<sup>90</sup>  Apparently, the NPR did not think this recommendation duplicated its proposal to reinvent the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) and charge it with improving intergovernmental service delivery.
<p>
<li> To coordinate science policy, the NPR recommended that the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology be modified and reconstituted by presidential directive "as the National Science and Technology Council."<sup>91</sup>
<p>
<li> To solve procurement problems, the NPR recommended the creation of "an interagency team to develop a plan for improving federal information technology acquisitions."<sup>92</sup> The problem of overregulation was to be solved by the creation of "an interagency Regulatory Coordinating Group to share information and coordinate approaches to regulatory issues."<sup>93</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Ronald Moe, expanding this informal layer of government will further reduce the authority and management function of the President: "What does this devolution of management functions to the employee and broadening span of control mean to the President?  For one thing, it will mean that presidents will have to manage more through negotiations than through authoritative relationships."<sup>94</sup>  Moe believes the permanent bureaucracy, not the President, will then have ultimate control over federal policy.
<p>
<b>Poor Stewardship of Federal Assets</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Washington's poor record of managing the nation's assets has created an almost unaffordable liability for future taxpayers. According to many sources, the known environmental cleanup costs at government-owned facilities could reach $400 billion over the next few decades, with as much as $350 billion of this liability incurred at Department of Energy facilities alone. Hundreds of other government-owned physical assets, such as the National Highway System, the Park System, dams, waterways, computer systems, and buildings, are coming dangerously close to collapse. With a greater share of the federal budget dedicated to entitlement programs, it is unlikely the resources will be there when the bill comes due for these liabilities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The political and bureaucratic processes do not encourage protection of the long-term health of government assets. Since these assets are "owned" by everyone for the use of all citizens, it is in no one's interest (be he citizen, politician, or bureaucrat) to ensure that they are sufficiently maintained for the next generation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are three principal reasons why public resources tend to fall into disrepair faster than private assets and why they fail to get the funds necessary to insure proper upkeep and maintenance. First, public assets typically are underpriced (often free), so consumers of public resources have an incentive to use as much of a resource as they can before the next consumer does. Second, the political process rewards short-term spending priorities, such as pork-barrel projects, and discourages long-term spending on maintaining assets. Third, agency managers are not punished for failing to maintain an asset as they would be in the private sector.<sup>95</sup>  In a perverse way, the political budgetary process can reward an agency with a new program to "modernize" a neglected asset.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the many examples of "government failure" that has allowed public assets to deteriorate are the following:
<p><ul>
<li> According to GAO Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, "The poor condition of agency financial systems is a symptom of a much broader issue -- the federal government's overall inability to effectively manage investments in information technology (IT). Many projects have been poorly managed, cost much more than anticipated, and have not provided intended benefits."<sup>96</sup>  Moreover, "In March 1995, OMB reported that 39 percent of agency systems were originally implemented over 10 years ago; 53 percent need to be replaced or upgraded within the next 5 years."<sup>97</sup>
<p>
<li> Many of the 337 dams built by the Bureau of Reclamation are over a half-century old and in desperate need of repair.<sup>98</sup>
<p>
<li> The Forest Service needs $644 million to maintain and reconstruct trails and recreation sites.<sup>99</sup>
<p>
<li> The National Park Service has a $4 billion backlog of infrastructure maintenance, nearly double the backlog the Service reported in 1993. As a result, the infrastructure at many of the nation's most famous sites, such as the Grand Canyon, the Washington Monument, and Independence Hall, is "at risk."<sup>100</sup>
<p>
<li> By the turn of the century, many of the water resources projects in the Army Corps of Engineers' $125 billion inventory will have reached the end of their design life. "The major structures have an average age of 33 years, and 12 percent of the projects are over 50 years old."<sup>101</sup>
<p>
<li> As of FY 1995, the Federal Highway Administration reported that 18 percent of the bridges in the National Highway System and 14 percent of the bridges in other federal-aid highways, were functionally obsolete. The FHWA estimates the "average annual cost to maintain bridge conditions and performance... at $5.2 billion over the next 15 years."<sup>102</sup>
<p>
<li> The Federal Highway Administration assists in the maintenance and construction of over 58,000 miles of roads within the Forest Service and the National Park Service, as well as on Indian Reservations. The vast majority of these roads are reported to be in fair or poor condition. The FHWA estimates that the total backlog of improvements needed on these roads is $8.5 billion.<sup>103</sup>
<p>
<li> "Years of neglect at Department of Defense and Department of Energy installations have left a legacy of contamination that these agencies now estimate may cost close to $200 billion to correct. These estimates do not take into account the full federal cleanup liability."<sup>104</sup>
<p>
<li> About 270 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserves cannot be safely removed at this time because of water leakage, natural gas seepage, and heat buildup. The cost of maintaining this 20-year-old facility grows each year.<sup>105</sup>
<p>
<li> Ongoing Federal Aviation Administration modernization projects are years behind schedule, with the Air Traffic Control System dependent on obsolete equipment. "Of the more than 200 projects in FAA's modernization effort, only 36 are completed, accounting for just 3 percent of the $32 billion" FAA will have to spend to upgrade the Air Traffic Control System between 1982 and 2000.<sup>106</sup>
<p>
<li> The National Weather Service modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<sup>107</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Reinvention" cannot save programs as broken as these from eventual collapse. The only way to raise the capital necessary to rescue them is through privatization. The Clinton Administration, however, has made only token gestures toward privatization and has not seriously advanced such proposals in Congress. As a result, the nation's assets continue to deteriorate, placing and enormous liability on the next generation of taxpayers.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After three years of "reinventing government," federal spending continues to soar and Washington continues to waste taxpayers' money on programs that should be dramatically overhauled, terminated, privatized, or transferred to state or local governments. The civilian federal workforce has fallen to its lowest level since 1965, but Washington simply spends 30 percent more for every government worker. This is not the kind of efficiency taxpayers thought they were getting from a government that the Administration itself says must "work better and cost less."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Moreover, reports conducted by official "watchdog" agencies like the U.S. General Accounting Office and agency Inspectors General document a government in shambles, unable to perform even rudimentary functions in an efficient manner. Meanwhile, the Administration's pseudo-reforms may entertain the media, but they fail either to address or to remedy the government's most serious problems. Reinvention has failed to cure such problems as widespread financial mismanagement, lack of management accountability, widespread program duplication and fragmentation, deteriorating assets, and programs that survive long after they have become obsolete.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

President Clinton was right when he said that the federal government is "not just broke, it's broken."  But his solution, and the solutions put forward by the National Performance Review, amount to little more than putting new paint on an old termite-infested house with a crumbling foundation. Given the weakened state of too many government programs, it may be time to move out the remodelers and bring in the wrecking ball.

<center><h2>SPEECH NEVER PROHIBITED -- UNTIL NOW,<br>
VICTORY IN <i>SCHENCK</i> CASE &quot;CRUCIAL&quot;</h2>

<p>

<h4>Family Research Council filed brief/attended arguments today.</h4>
</center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Never in the history of our country
has a federal court prohibited peaceful, non-threatening speech
on a public sidewalk where access to businesses is not impeded,&quot;
noted Family Research Council Legal Director Cathy Cleaver on
Wednesday.

<p>

She made her comments following oral arguments before the Supreme
Court today in <I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New
York.</I>  The Court examined an injunction prohibiting sidewalk
counselors from speaking within 15 feet of anyone going to or
coming from an abortion clinic -- even on public streets and sidewalks.
<b>Family Research Council filed a brief with the Court and held
a Moot Court to assist the lawyers with oral argument preparation.</b>

<p>

Miss Cleaver, who is an attorney, observed: &quot;Several justices
today seemed to agree with the argument of Jay Sekulow of the
American Center for Law and Justice who made a First Amendment
case. Sekulow said sidewalk counselors must remain free to appeal
to young mothers for the lives of their unborn children. 'There
is no medical exception to the First Amendment,' he argued. Justices
Ginsberg and Breyer seemed to be saying that the possibility of
jostling outside a clinic is significant enough to consider silencing
free speech protections in the Constitution.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Sekulow agreed that those acts can rightly be stopped,
but that stopping all speech was overkill.  Justice Scalia, in
a colorful moment, suggested that Mr. Sekulow was, in essence,
saying: 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never
hurt me.'&quot;

<p>

<b>Cleaver said, &quot;A victory in the <I>Schenck</I> case is
crucial to show that the First Amendment is not a promise only
for the politically correct, and that the rights of, as Justice
Scalia calls it,  a 'currently disfavored class' of pro-life Americans
are not trashed.&quot;</b>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For the past nine months, over 35,000<sup>1</sup> members of America's armed forces have been deployed as part of the NATO implementation force in Bosnia (IFOR). These soldiers were sent to the Balkans to enforce the military provisions of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/current/bosnia/bosagree.html">Dayton Peace Accord</a> of November 1995. President Bill Clinton, in an address to the nation on November 27, 1995, told the American people that the mission "should and will take about one year."<sup>2</sup>  The House and Senate subsequently adopted resolutions expressing reluctant support for the Bosnia mission and authorizing the deployment of U.S. troops specifically for this one-year period.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, recent press reports revealed that the Clinton Administration plans to deploy at least 5,000 new GIs to Bosnia in a "covering force" mission that would last at least until March 1997.<sup>3</sup>  Administration officials defending the surprise move stressed the unstable and dangerous situation in Bosnia as the cause for deployment. In the meantime, NATO has called for a continued military presence in Bosnia (what has been called a "stabilization force").
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Administration officials have refused to define what role the U.S. might play in Bosnia beyond next spring. On October 3, 1996, Secretary of Defense William Perry assured the Senate Armed Services Committee that no firm commitment to a new NATO force has been made; during NATO meetings in Norway the previous week, however, the Secretary of Defense refused to specify any conditions or guidelines that might frame the circumstances in which the U.S. might participate in a new implementation force for Bosnia. This ambiguity has left the door wide open for an open-ended and undefined U.S. military commitment to Bosnia that could last throughout 1997 and beyond.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such a commitment is both unwise and disproportional to U.S. national security interests in Bosnia. The U.S. needs a plan to extricate its forces from Bosnia in stages and to turn the responsibility for consolidating the peace to other European organizations. To ensure that it does not become bogged down in an open-ended military commitment in Bosnia, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li> Keep only a limited number of U.S. support troops in place in Bosnia in 1997. There should be no American combat ground troops in a new IFOR.
<p>
<li> Organize a follow-on implementation force in Bosnia under NATO's new Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) concept with a European commander.
<p>
<li> Remove all U.S. troops from the Balkans by 1998.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This staged removal of the U.S. and NATO from Bosnia is necessary if the U.S. and its flagship alliance, NATO, are to avoid a likely decades-long military commitment to Bosnia. For 32 years, the United Nations has been chained to an open-ended peacekeeping commitment in Cyprus. It would be highly injurious to NATO to be involved in Bosnia for the next 30 years. To avoid making Bosnia a ward of the U.S., and NATO an emasculated collective security or peacekeeping alliance, the U.S. must now put forth those conditions to European allies.
<p>

<b>THE POLITICAL FAILURE OF PEACEKEEPING IN BOSNIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia has been a military success but a political failure. This contradiction is rooted in the fact that the military provisions of the Dayton Accord are working at cross purposes with its political provisions. The military mission is to separate the existing Serb, Croat, and Muslim forces, while the political goal is to unify Bosnia. These goals are irreconcilable. Since the beginning of the mission, the military component has endured steady criticism about its refusal to launch manhunts for indicted war criminals and strictly enforce the right of refugees to return to their pre-war homes. If NATO undertook these tasks, however, it could re-ignite the war it is supposed to be preventing, not to mention embarking on the sort of "mission creep" that doomed the United Nations' intervention in Somalia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As a result, the efforts of 53,000 military troops from some 30 countries have done little to advance the political provisions of the Dayton agreement. The principal mission of the military forces while manning the zone of separation in Bosnia was self-preservation. This was especially true of U.S. troops, whose missions were organized mainly to avoid casualties in an election year. While the U.S. has suffered only one death from hostile incidents since December 1995, the IFOR operation has cost $3.5 billion -- more than twice the Administration's 1995 estimate.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That investment was intended to finance a one-year military effort aimed at implementing the political provisions of the Dayton Peace Accord. That hope is looking bleak, however; the September 14 elections in Bosnia merely confirmed the illusionary nature of the Dayton agreements, evident to many in 1995.<sup>5</sup>  The Dayton Accord's goal of a united and multiethnic Bosnia is wholly unrealizable. In the recent elections, over 80 percent of Bosnians voted in solid ethnic blocs, and few refugees crossed ethnic lines to vote in their pre-war districts. Thus, the factions of Bosnia have claimed with ballots what they had fought for with bullets. As Senator Russell Feingold (D-WI) noted on the eve of the elections, this "bring[s] us back to where we started: a region full of hostile, ethnically divided factions facing off at tenuous borders, under unstable military, economic, and social conditions."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Dayton Accord's vision of a multiethnic Bosnia is doomed, and partition appears to be inevitable. All that remains is to establish the political goals of a follow-on peacekeeping force and devise the military missions needed to achieve those goals. More important for U.S. military planners will be whether the goals of the military forces are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable, and whether they truly contribute to achieving the political goals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

NATO planners are creating four options for IFOR II. The working assumption is that the U.S. will play a leading role in all of them.
<blockquote>
<b>OPTION #1: Complete withdrawal.</b> This is the least likely option and will get little attention and consideration. America's European allies, who have always been more realistic about the many years that will be needed to patch up Bosnia, regard the one-year time limit as no more than a U.S. election-year ploy. This option presents a stark alternative that probably will be rejected by NATO. No one in NATO wants to walk away from Bosnia entirely.
<p>
<b>OPTION #2: War prevention.</b> This option foresees a smaller NATO force with significant combat capabilities. This force, charged mainly with keeping the factions from resuming the war, would deter (and perhaps defeat) any large-scale organized violence that might break out after the departure of IFOR. Given the European reliance on U.S. combat capabilities, this option would require a significant U.S. military presence. The assumption is that the Bosnians would carry on with political reconciliation under a NATO security umbrella designed to prevent the renewal of factional fighting.
<p>
<b>OPTION #3: A "sustainment" force.</b> This force, about half the size of IFOR, would require about 20,000 troops in Bosnia. It would have the unclear mission of maintaining a general atmosphere of peace and security. It also would be more involved in the political reconciliation of Bosnia than a "war prevention" force but probably would continue to avoid such tasks as hunting down war criminals and enforcing the return of refugees to their pre-war homes. NATO is most likely to choose this option because its mission is the least clear and therefore less likely to polarize either the NATO allies or political factions inside Bosnia. All sides can see in this option exactly what they wish to see. The Europeans could envision an extended presence, while the U.S. would be happy with a reduced presence.
<p>
<b>OPTION #4: Full-scale continuation of IFOR and its current mission.</b> Adoption of this option is not likely because it would require a continued American commitment of some 35,000 U.S. troops to the region -- a politically insupportable position in the U.S. In addition, while America has every intention of reducing its commitment, the European allies have made it clear that they will not increase their own troop commitment to keep a follow-on force up to IFOR's current strength.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Options 2, 3, and 4 all involve a significant U.S. ground presence in the Balkans for the foreseeable future: 10,000 to 12,000 U.S. ground troops in Bosnia, Croatia, and Hungary. The U.S. has laid down no criteria for U.S. participation in a follow-on force; nor has the Pentagon recommended one of these NATO options to the President. This public refusal to specify the conditions under which U.S. troops will participate has left NATO planners with the impression that the level of American participation in IFOR II will remain the same as it was in the original mission. Conversely, the European allies have set forth their criteria by stating repeatedly that they have no intention of staying in Bosnia if the U.S. pulls out.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the U.S. has hinted at reducing its presence in Bosnia, the Europeans have made no efforts to step into the leadership vacuum if the U.S. leaves. German officials say they are prepared to provide up to 3,000 soldiers for an IFOR II of 20,000 to 25,000 troops.<sup>7</sup>  The French and British commitments to a follow-on force will be consistent with their commitments to the original IFOR; neither government has indicated a willingness to change its level of commitment to a Bosnian peace force. In any event, the European assumption is that America is still expected to provide the lion's share of any new peacekeeping force. There is no evidence whatever that America's European allies are prepared to step up to the plate and assume a greater share of the military burden in Bosnia.
<p>
<b>THE BIG PICTURE: BOSNIA AND NATO'S DIVISION OF LABOR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Politicians from all sides of the American political spectrum maintain that while the U.S. is a world leader, it cannot be responsible for policing the world. Distinguishing between the two roles of global power and global cop requires the ability to choose where and when to use America's military forces, as well as to understand how they can be used most effectively. It also requires an alliance system in which the U.S. acts like a great power and does not try to put out every brushfire in the world. America must demand that prosperous and powerful allies take the lead in addressing local crises that are peripheral to American security interests. If the U.S. does not enforce this implicit bargain, the allies will continue to let it do the heavy lifting in missions like Bosnia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This unfair and unwise sharing of the security burden in Europe is neither politically nor militarily sustainable. In addition to perpetuating an outdated division of labor, it flies in the face of at least three long-range political and security trends in the alliance.
<p><blockquote>
<b>TREND #1: Strategic Strain.</b><br>
Because of post-Cold War cuts in the U.S. defense budget, America's armed forces have shrunk by some 35 percent since 1991. However, while "supply" has been reduced, "demand" has not diminished. America's overseas military requirements have not decreased since the end of the Cold War. In fact, they have increased in many circumstances. As a result, the U.S. does not have a force large enough to carry out the national security strategy designed by the President. It is well-known that the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review (BUR) Force will not be large enough to fulfill the task of winning the number of major regional conflicts required by the present national strategy. It also is widely known that the current force is not adequately funded.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
What is less well-known is the effect of this double mismatch on the men and women of America's armed forces. Attempts to bridge this gap between the ends and means of American strategy have left America's armed forces severely strained, demoralized, and unprepared for the future. The results: U.S. forces deploy at three to four times the rate of the Cold War; major combat training exercises have been canceled; "gaps" appear regularly in the coverage provided by the shrinking Navy to key regions of the globe; problems with divorce, quality of life, and re-enlistment are on the rise; and money spent to recapitalize the armed forces for the future is down by some 70 percent since the Reagan years.<sup>9</sup>  Robert Gaskin, a former Pentagon planner, states that the armed forces' men and materiel are "approaching burnout."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) believes that strategic strain is "stretching our military [to] the verge of the breaking point."  He warns that "at some point somebody needs to stand up and say there is a minimum size to being the world's only superpower, and we have gotten smaller than that in terms of our regular units, and we have an obligation to insist on a military in which people can serve without being burned out by the sheer constancy of their being used."<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<b>TREND #2: Diverging Military Competencies.</b><br>
The core competencies of the armed forces of the United States and its European allies are diverging, making the European allies more dependent on the U.S. for military operations. For the most part, the U.S. armed forces are focused on deterrence and warfighting against aggressive states. While the U.S. is prepared to go to war in a number of regions to protect American interests and American allies; the NATO allies are slashing defense spending and refocusing their military establishments on peacekeeping and operations other than war.
<p>
As in the United States, monetary concerns are one of the principal driving forces behind the changing military capabilities of the NATO allies. While Korea and Japan have increased their defense spending since the end of the Cold War, America's European allies have cut defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) by an average of one-third.<sup>12</sup>  Most of these funding reductions have been precipitated by the need to meet the stringent fiscal requirements of European Union monetary integration.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
More important, America's allies are not investing in military systems needed to project power and conduct sustained warfighting campaigns; rather, they are preparing for regional peacekeeping and other low-intensity conflicts. With only a few exceptions, they are not investing in strategic airlift and sealift; strategic logistics systems; space-based command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) networks; and modern weapon systems based on revolutionary advances in information technology.<sup>14</sup>  In Bosnia, while the allies provide over 50 percent of the implementation force, the U.S. supplies 46 of the 48 satellites used by IFOR for command, control, communications, and intelligence.
<p>
<b>TREND #3: Diverging Security Interests.</b><br>
During the Cold War, the overwhelming threat from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact caused allied interests to converge and provided a centripetal force that held NATO together. However, most post-Cold War security challenges will be well below the threshold of a major power threat. Problems like the ethnic battles in the former Yugoslavia threaten local and regional security interests more directly than they do the more global security interests of the United States. Common sense would dictate that local powers and regional security arrangements should be the "primary care networks" for small regional security crises. States with the most immediate interests should be the principal candidates for providing most of the resources necessary to solve the problem.
<p>
The recent series of confrontations with Iraq and the multinational operation in Somalia highlight the diverging security interests of the U.S. and its allies. In both cases, the coalitions were faced with relatively minor threats but could not agree on common approaches to solving the crises. In Iraq, the French criticized the U.S. action and refused to help the British and American air forces patrolling the extended no-fly zone. In Somalia, the U.S. virtually accused the Italian contingent of being in league with warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed and even publicly asked the U.N. to fire the Italian commander. These examples highlight the fact that when allies face lesser threats, their interests can differ greatly. It therefore behooves an alliance managing a crisis like Bosnia to match the differing interests and capabilities of various allies to different roles and responsibilities. In other words, the U.S. should not be expected to have the same degree of interest in a local European security affair as the European allies themselves have.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The Imperative of American Leadership: A New Security Bargain </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These trends suggest that the U.S. needs to strike a new security bargain with its European allies. The U.S. should keep the military alliances that served it well during the Cold War and are still useful in protecting vital interests, but it must adapt them to the changing nature of the post-Cold War world. America's role in these alliances should be focused on the military tasks that directly protect America's vital interests. This means, primarily, deterring major power threats to the United States and such key regions as Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf, and ensuring unimpeded U.S. access to such key global systems as trade, finance, energy, and natural resources. America's alliances exist to serve these missions and to make American power more effective by harnessing and using the resources and energies of allies who share these goals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In return for this commitment to the major tasks of global security, America's allies increasingly must take the lead in smaller regional and local security crises that exist well below the threshold of vital U.S. national interests. In these crises, the U.S. must play only a supporting role, helping allies with unique and decisive U.S. military capabilities. In general, America must reserve its limited resources for the singular and critical tasks of global security that it alone can accomplish.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Good leaders measure the differing talents and resources of their team, and match missions and tasks to those team members most suited for the job. In this way, the overall effect of the alliance is more than the sum of its members. As management guru Peter Drucker has noted, "effective leaders delegate a good many things; they have to or they drown in trivia. But they do not delegate the one thing that only they can do with excellence, the one thing that will make a difference, the one thing that will set standards, the one thing they want to be remembered for. They do it."<sup>15</sup>  The U.S. cannot and should not delegate its superpower role in global security, but it can and must delegate regional peacekeeping to those local powers well-equipped to do it.

<b>WHAT KIND OF NEW PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN BOSNIA?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A follow-on Bosnian peacekeeping force, or IFOR II, should be smaller; should have fewer tanks, artillery, and other "heavy" forces; and should be more European. The U.S. and its European allies generally agree on those conditions, but they have very different ideas about the extent to which the U.S. should be involved. Since the Dayton Accord was signed, European officials have been much more realistic and forthcoming about the need for a long-term military commitment to Bosnia. Moreover, French and British officials repeatedly have insisted that they would not keep forces in Bosnia if U.S. forces were withdrawn. Thus, the negotiations over an IFOR II are likely to come down to a battle of political will, with the European allies attempting to obtain the largest U.S. commitment they can while the U.S. tries to provide the smallest force possible. To avoid this trap, the U.S. should take the initiative in the NATO planning cycle. To prepare for this, the U.S. should insist on the following specific conditions:
<p><ul>
<li><b> NATO should use the new Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) concept to organize a follow-on peacekeeping force in Bosnia.</b> A U.S. initiative, the CJTF was conceived in 1993 and, after several years of painstaking negotiations, agreed upon by NATO ministers in June 1996. The Combined Joint Task Force is a flexible military structure in which Europeans can lead while still borrowing some NATO resources for the task at hand. The CJTF makes it possible for European allies to assume the chief responsibility for regional problems (like Bosnia) while the U.S. commitment to NATO remains focused on the collective defense of Europe against outside aggression.16  It also is a practical mechanism that can stiffen the political resolve among European allies about their abilities to organize and undertake small crisis management, humanitarian relief, and peacekeeping missions. 
<p>
A CJTF for a follow-on force in Bosnia can come in several forms and can be led either by NATO or by a European security organization like the West European Union (WEU). The units involved in a CJTF are "separable but not separate" and could be "leased" from NATO. A CJTF is temporary and mission specific: Its units return to the NATO fold after mission completion or in the event of more important NATO contingencies.
<p>
Any force following IFOR should have less combat power and more civilian resources. The military mission of separating Bosnian forces can be accomplished by European combat troops. The important work left to be done in the political, economic, and social reconstruction of Bosnia is the province of civilian aid workers and administrators, not combat troops.
<p>
<li><b> The new force should be less American and more European.</b> The U.S. is involved in NATO to help protect Europe from major power threats, not to police out-of-area ethnic disputes. Moreover, the U.S. cannot credibly undertake the former task while involved in the latter.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
As a general proposition, the U.S. should limit its contribution to support units that are truly unique and decisive for the European-led effort: air and sea support, command and control resources, communications units, and limited logistics support from Hungary and Croatia. U.S. units in Bosnia itself should be restricted to combat service support units such as intelligence, command and control, communications, medical, military police, and civil affairs. In addition, for contingency planning purposes, the U.S. can provide a quick-reaction combat force from either the airborne infantry regiment in Vicenza, Italy, or an armored task force stationed temporarily in Hungary. This force could reinforce European peacekeepers in the event of an emergency they are unable to handle.
<p><li>
<b>American armed forces should not be involved in Bosnia in any capacity after 1997.</b> A continued NATO presence in Bosnia, led by Europeans and supported by the United States, will buy the Bosnians even more "breathing space."  After 1997, however, any continuation of the military mission should come from Europe alone. The U.S. and NATO can leave Bosnia with their accomplishments intact if it is done in stages and while preparing other European organizations, such as the Western European Union or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), to take over after NATO's departure.<sup>18</sup> 
<p>
<li><b>Control and management of the Bosnian peacekeeping force should devolve eventually from NATO to other European initiatives like the WEU and OSCE.</b> NATO must reassume its principal role as the alliance providing for the collective defense of Europe. If NATO sees its <i>raison d'etre</i> in collective security actions like Balkan peacekeeping, it will become as emasculated as the OSCE.<sup>19</sup>  NATO is built around a clear mission and focused purpose; it should not become the dumping ground for every security crisis in Europe.
<p>
<li><b>The new force should resemble a traditional peacekeeping operation.</b> NATO should abandon the unrealizable goal of an integrated Bosnia as envisaged under the Dayton Accord. There is no achievable military mission for a follow-on force in Bosnia that would support the goals of Dayton. On the other hand, reduced political expectations about Bosnian integration can be supported by a peacekeeping presence throughout 1997. If the political solution is realistic and recognizes that Bosnia will evolve based on some form of partition, peacekeepers can support that goal. European-led peacekeepers therefore should limit their military ambitions to manning the zones of separation to ensure that no large-scale combat operations are conducted within Bosnia.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


There is no way to predict with assurance what will happen to Bosnia in 1997 and beyond. Most experts agree that the prospects for a multiethnic state as envisaged by the Dayton Accord are dim. Because this political forecast is so gloomy and the political goals are so contentious and unachievable, it is highly doubtful that a clear and authoritative military mission can be defined for IFOR II. This combination of factors points to a protracted international presence that will have to "muddle-through" in Bosnia for years to come.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A new peacekeeping force should not be led by the United States. In the long run, such a presence should be the responsibility of an organization like the WEU or OSCE. America's main purpose in NATO should not be to police out-of-area ethnic conflicts in Europe.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. participation in IFOR is coming to a close, and Congress should hold the President to his promise of a mission that would take "about one year."  A follow-on force in Bosnia can include a small U.S. support presence, but the entire enterprise must be underpinned by the clear indication of a European willingness to take charge of a difficult situation now that "breathing room" has been attained with the help of the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To support its European allies, the U.S. should accept the temporary attachment of American troops to a new Bosnian peacekeeping force. However, this force should be composed largely of European ground troops, and U.S. forces should remain under U.S. command. In this way, America can do what it does best -- focus on larger military contingencies -- while the Europeans take on a larger share of the peacekeeping burden.

<h2>&quot;HARM REDUCTION&quot;<br>
AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DRUG<br>
WAR?</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

&quot;Harm reduction&quot; is a new approach to the drug abuse
crisis which is winning disciples worldwide.  Its goal is to legalize
drugs, stop illicit substance interdiction efforts and step up
abuse treatment.

<p>

The &quot;harm reduction&quot; approach maintains that drug abuse
is inevitable and that society must learn to accept the &quot;responsible
use&quot; of psychoactive substances.  It ignores the physiological
and psychological effects of illicit drugs, preferring concepts
that include outright legalization of all drugs or non-enforcement
of existing drug laws.  There is evidence that the United States
is embracing &quot;harm reduction.&quot;

<p><ul>

<li>In 1996 Californians are being asked to decide whether to
legalize the medical use of marijuana even though pot's healing
qualities have never been proven and there are thousands of scientific
reports showing harmful effects.  Similar initiatives are gaining
momentum in other states.

<p>

<li>Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has introduced legislation which
provides &quot;for the therapeutic use of marijuana in situations
involving life-threatening or sense-threatening illnesses and
to provide adequate supplies of marijuana for such use.&quot;[1]
This legislation has both Republican and Democrat co-sponsors.

<p>

<li>There are at least 75 needle giveaway programs in 55 American
cities.[2] These programs give needles to addicts to ostensibly
slow the spread of the AIDS virus, but there is evidence that
high risk drug abusers are at least as likely to contract the
disease through sexual contact. Moreover, giving needles encourages
drug abuse. Some of these programs are paid for with tax dollars.

<p>

<li>Conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr. has joined the
harm reduction camp.  The February 1996 edition of  <I>National
Review</I> featured Buckley and six &quot;harm reduction&quot;
proponents agreeing that the drug war has failed and calling for
decriminalization of illicit drugs.

<p>

<li>Billionaire philanthropist George Soros has given $15 million
to fund organizations that actively promote harm reduction programs.
Soros is also the major financial backer for California's medical
marijuana ballot initiative and has financed many needle giveaway
programs.[3]

<p>

<li>Major television networks have featured news magazines that
sympathetically portray harm reduction as an answer to the &quot;failed&quot;
drug war. On April 6, 1995, ABC's Catherine Crier began her news
magazine, &quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
with the statement, &quot;If America cannot win the war on drugs,
it should try instead to reduce the harm associated with drug
abuse.&quot;

<p>

<li>The Clinton administration has overseen a &quot;controlled
shift&quot; in drug policy from an aggressive interdiction policy
to one of harm reduction.  The federal government's ability to
disrupt drug shipments has been reduced by 64 percent.[4] Foreign
anti-drug programs have been cut by 55 percent and domestic marijuana
eradication by 59 percent. Meanwhile, between 1992 and 1996 funds
for treatment rose 19 percent.[5]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>THE ORIGINS OF &QUOT;HARM REDUCTION&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

Harm reduction was appropriated from the safety and insurance
industries. These industries try to minimize the consequences
and probabilities of accidents and costly illnesses by providing
incentives for behaviors like wearing safety belts, not smoking,
exercising regularly and avoiding high-risk sports such as skydiving
and auto racing.  This business philosophy has been transferred
into drug-related public policy.

<p>

The Netherlands was the first country to adopt a &quot;harm reduction&quot;
public policy.  In the 1970s, the Dutch responded to an outbreak
of hepatitis among injection drug users by passing out clean needles.
The concept gained momentum with the AIDS epidemic and quickly
spread across Europe. Harm reducers have expanded the concept
to include heroin maintenance programs, legalization of marijuana
and reduced interdiction and enforcement efforts.

<p>

America's Harm Reduction Coalition published an article that outlines
defining practices.[6]

<p><ul>

<li>&quot;Every time a needle exchange program participant ditches
a used syringe to avoid arrest rather than bring it back to the
exchange, he is practicing harm reduction.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;And every time a dope-injecting [person] or pot smoker
spends all day traveling around the city in search of good drugs,
as inconvenient as this may be, she is practicing a form of harm
reduction.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;Every time a methadone patient 'beats' his urine to
stay in the program, he is practicing harm reduction.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;A user might be able to do the networking needed to
find good drugs in the half an hour he spends at a street-based
needle exchange site -- networking that might otherwise have taken
half a day.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;While not legally available to users unless they are
a patient of an authorized clinic, there is an underground system
for obtaining methadone that most commonly revolves around the
sale of weekend pick-ups.  Lovers, spouses, family members, and
friends often share a single methadone prescription.&quot;

</ul><p>

The American Civil Liberties Union's AIDS project is a leading
promoter of &quot;harm reduction&quot; in America. &quot;Harm
reduction attempts to instrumentalize the notion of meeting individuals
'where they're at,'&quot; says the ACLU, &quot;by providing each
user with as many techniques and tools as possible to reduce that
user's particular drug-related problems.&quot;[7] It labels &quot;harm
reduction&quot; the &quot;safe sex&quot; approach to preventing
drug abuse.

<p>

The whole harm reduction approach is a complete reversal of the
&quot;zero tolerance&quot; nature of this nation's recent drug
policy.  According to the ACLU, harm reduction &quot;assumes that
drug users' civil rights and individual autonomy should be respected,
treats drug users as important participants in the process of
gaining or maintaining control over their drug use, and makes
no moral judgment based solely upon an individual's use of drugs.&quot;[8]

<p>

Wayne Roques, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration agent,
disagrees. &quot;Harm reduction entails enabling the users to
continue their self-destructive behavior,&quot; says Roques.[9]
&quot;It is more logical to reduce the demand for drugs by improving
and expanding law enforcement, education, prevention, research,
rehabilitation and recovery programs.&quot;[10]

<p>

<center><h3>HARM REDUCTION'S POPULARITY</h3></center>

<p>

The successful anti-drug efforts of the 1980s cut abuse in half
and slowed the flow of illicit drugs to American shores.  That
victory was based on a balanced interdiction (supply reduction)
and simple &quot;just say no&quot; demand reduction policy, but
recently those trends have changed dramatically.

<p>

Demand has increased especially among adolescents. On August
20, 1996, the federal government released the National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse indicating that an estimated 12.8 million
Americans are currently abusing illicit drugs.  Adolescent abuse
is especially high.  Since 1992 drug abuse by teenagers has risen
105 percent.[11]

<p>

As abuse has risen, efforts to reduce supply have declined. Consider
recent evidence.

<p><ul>

<li>A June 1996 General Accounting Office report, &quot;Counternarcotics
Efforts in Mexico,&quot; states, &quot;Mexico is the primary [70
percent] transit country for cocaine entering the United States
from South America.&quot;  The report says that interdiction funding
for the transit zone has declined from &quot;about $1 billion
in fiscal year 1992 to about $570 million in fiscal year 1995.&quot;
This decline happened in spite of the State Department's March
1996 assertion that &quot;no country in the world poses a more
immediate narcotics threat to the United States than Mexico.&quot;[12]

<p>

<li>An April 1996 General Accounting Office report, entitled &quot;U.S.
Interdiction Efforts in the Caribbean Decline,&quot; states that
&quot;30 percent of the cocaine entering the United States comes
through the Caribbean section of the transit zone.&quot;  In November
1993, the executive branch issued a counternarcotics policy which
called for a &quot;controlled shift in emphasis from the transit
zone to the source countries.&quot;  The same GAO report states:
&quot;While a reduction in the interdiction effort was envisioned
in the new cocaine strategy, the strategy also anticipated an
increase in source country funding that never materialized.&quot;[13]

<p>

<li>Domestic efforts to eradicate marijuana have been cut 59 percent
since 1992.[14]

<p>

<li>Since 1993 anti-drug defense funding has been cut 32 percent,
and government-wide interdiction funding has dropped 55 percent.[15]

</ul><p>

No policy shift was announced during the 1992 campaign.  Presidential
candidate Bill Clinton told the Democratic National Convention
in July 1992, &quot;[President Bush] hasn't fought a real war
on crime and drugs. I will.&quot;[16] He promised to combine tough
law enforcement with expanded treatment and prevention programs.

<p>

The President's 1993 &quot;controlled shift&quot; and his 1995
National Drug Strategy left little doubt that interdiction was
taking a backseat to harm reduction with a focus on treatment.
In his strategy Clinton states: &quot;The National Drug Control
Strategy...confirms...my priorities for addressing this nation's
continuing drug problem....This strategy gives those who have
fallen prey to drugs the opportunity to change their behavior.&quot;[17]

<p>

A Pentagon-commissioned report suggests that Clinton's &quot;controlled
shift&quot; has failed.  The 1996 study, by the Institute for
Defense Analyses, a Pentagon-funded think tank, criticizes the
shift away from interdiction to treatment.  It concludes that
interdiction is the most successful and cost-effective way of
dealing with the nation's drug epidemic.  Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.)
said of the Clinton administration and the IDA report, &quot;I
think they knowingly and willingly suppressed this document....If
they are trying to cook the report or modify it from its original
conclusions, I'd be even more concerned.&quot;[18]

<p>

<center><h3>HARM REDUCTION OVERSEAS</h3></center>

<p>

Harm reduction advocates are quick to tout the successes of foreign
drug policy experiments.  They suggest that America should declare
defeat and mimic foreign drug policy.  On close examination, the
foreign &quot;experiments&quot; may well represent yet another
form of defeat.

<p>

The European Cities on Drug Policy (ECDP) is the primary torch-bearer
for Europe's  harm reduction philosophy.  In 1990, the city of
Frankfurt/Main, Germany hosted ECDP's first international conference
which included officials from 22 cities and regions.  That conference
adopted the so-called Frankfurt Resolution which called for heroin
distribution to drug addicts, decriminalization of cannabis and
the introduction of shooting galleries (safe havens for abusers
to inject illicit drugs).[19] Today, it encourages other cities and
nations to embrace the tenets of harm reduction.  One of its first
disciples was Scotland.

<p>

&quot;Harm reduction really sounds good,&quot; says Kerry Condron,
18, a heroin addict from Glasgow, Scotland, &quot;but it doesn't
work.&quot;[20] Condron says that harm reduction has become another
way of perpetuating addiction.

<p>

Glasgow's harm reduction goal was to prevent the spread of AIDS
and to reduce crime.  Drug addicts were given clean needles and
methadone, a heroin substitute.[21]

<p>

Maxie Richards runs a home for Glasgow addicts.  She says that
harm reduction has become a vested interest of the social service
industry, and with only one purpose: keeping social peace at the
cost of dispensing drugs.  She argues that social workers have
too much power.  According to Richards, the harm reduction approach
says, &quot;If you have to take drugs we can live with it.&quot;[22]
In fact, harm reduction policies are often harmful.

<p>

Richards' views on harm reduction needle-exchanges have scientific
support. The August 3, 1996 edition of <I>The Lancet</I>, a respected
British medical journal, profiled a Montreal, Canada study which
found that injection drug users were two times more likely to
become infected with HIV than those who did not.  Researcher Julie
Bruneau said that the increased HIV risks were &quot;substantial
and consistent...despite extensive adjustments for confounders.&quot;[23]

<p>

The Dutch say they want to &quot;normalize&quot; addicts through
their harm reduction policy.  They do this by providing social
services such as medical care, housing, free methadone and needles.
About half of Amsterdam's [the largest Dutch city] 400 general
medical practitioners prescribe methadone for their patients.[24]

<p>

&quot;Normalizing&quot; includes providing clean needles to addicts.
Ton Quadt, the Rotterdam coordinator of all drug treatment programs
says, &quot;If you put in enough clean syringes and needles, people
don't have to use dirty needles, so the risk of getting HIV is
lessened, and I think the Dutch number will prove it.&quot;[25]

<p>

Studies of the Dutch policy provide some revealing numbers indeed.
In 1993, Dr. Karl Gunning, a Dutch physician and a harm reduction
opponent, wrote, &quot;The harm reduction Dutch policy of containing
heroin addiction through distribution of free needles and syringes
and through methadone distribution has not prevented the spread
of heroin addiction, curtailed drug-related crime, nor has it
proven to decrease the level of HIV infection.&quot;[26]

<p>

The Dutch harm reduction policy has, however, contributed to more
abuse.  Dr. Frans Koopsman, public relations director for the
Dutch government-funded treatment center &quot;De Hoop,&quot;
said, &quot;There's no taboo anymore on drug use.  For a great
part drug use is normalized in the sense that youngsters appear
to make no big fuss about using drugs.&quot;  He reports that
adolescent cannabis abuse has doubled since 1990 with perhaps
nine percent using pot on a regular basis.  He also reports that
80 percent of Dutch criminal activity is linked to drug abuse.[28]

<p>

Paul Oldenburger, a Delfzijl businessman, declares, &quot;The
war on drugs -- we lost it a long time ago.&quot;  He offered,
&quot;These coffee shops, they don't just sell the soft drugs.
Hard drugs are available too, and it's an easy step from one
to the other.&quot;[29]

<p>

Ernst Gunst manages a cannabis-selling club in the Dutch town
of Delfzijl.  Gunst's Paradox Cafe operates out of rented, municipally-owned
space and next door to the town library.  His business has the
support of the mayor and police chief.  Gunst explains that his
cafe is an experiment in cannabis regulation.  The town fathers
hope it will drive criminal elements out of business and keep
them out.[30]

<p>

Gunst espouses a harm reduction philosophy, explaining, &quot;The
message is:  Don't do drugs.  But if you want to use drugs, do
it in a healthy, conscious way.&quot;  He warns, &quot;If you
forbid it, people still want to use it, like the U.S. during prohibition.&quot;
Gunst says his cannabis supply is regularly checked for impurities
and the content levels of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in
cannabis.  He emphasizes health, explaining, &quot;That's why
we sell no soft drinks.  Coca-Cola is just water and sugar. It's
not healthy.&quot;[31]

<p>

The Dutch harm reducers have a worldwide reach via the Internet.
The Dutch drug-dealing firm Neuroroom sells &quot;weedcigars&quot;
and ready-made joints and slices of weed-hash cake via computer.
Payments for the drugs are handled by the Dutch PostBank.  According
to the Internet site, Neuroroom has &quot;successfully delivered
soft drugs to:  Japan, Israel, Sarajevo, USA, Sweden, Norway...and
of course, the Netherlands. Until now, we did a 95 percent delivery.&quot;[32]

<p>

Switzerland is seen as a model harm reduction state and has long
been a social Petri dish.  Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx's closest
collaborator, said, &quot;Small countries like Belgium and Switzerland
are modern political laboratories, the experimental fields in
which the kind of experience is collected that shall be applied
later on in large countries.&quot;

<p>

In 1986, the Swiss began experimenting with needle programs. 
After legalizing over-the-counter syringe sales, the Swiss soon
embraced free needle distribution.  In 1988, Zurich's Platzpitz
Park was opened for free needle distribution, and soon the city
was flooded with foreign addicts.  As many as 15,000 needles were
given away each day before the park was closed in 1992.[33]

<p>

Dr. Franziska Haller, a Swiss psychologist, pharmacist and anti-drug
activist, said that Zurich's permissive drug policy was designed
to put pressure on the federal government to start a nationwide
heroin distribution program.  She says this is a big step toward
drug legalization -- the ultimate goal of harm reducers.[34]

<p>

The Swiss government began a heroin giveaway program in 1993.
There is an ongoing experiment in nine cities where heroin, morphine
and methadone are given away.  The project, scheduled to end in
December, 1996, includes 700 addicts.  Nearly half of these addicts
are HIV-positive.  They are given free drugs up to nine times
a day.  At night they are given heroin cigarettes for use at home.
The cost is covered by health insurance or the government.[35]

<p>

The experiment's goal, according to Dr. Haller, is to improve
addict health, decrease criminal activity, cut addicts off from
drug dealers and stop abuse.  Unfortunately, the number of addicts
is rising, and the experiment has cut neither illegal drug abuse
nor crime.  It is also reported that police officials in Bern
and Zurich have been ordered not to arrest drug consumers and
dealers.[36]

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICA'S HARM REDUCTION DISCIPLES</h3></center>

<p>

America's cadre of harm reduction disciples is growing in influence.
They have moved into elitist ranks, and many are financed by
pro-drug billionaire financier George Soros.

<p>

Soros, a Hungarian immigrant worth perhaps $1 billion, reportedly
gave away more than $350-million last year, the bulk to Eastern
European projects.[37] He has invested in American social problems,
such as schools, abortion rights, electoral politics, drugs and
death.  In 1995, he gave $5 million to the American &quot;Project
on Death in America&quot; and over the last few years, he has
given as estimated $15 million to drug legalization organizations.[38]

<p>

Soros is a very influential man.  He deals with social issues,
saying that he indulges his &quot;messianic fantasies in giving
away money.&quot;[39] According to Kevin Quigley, a scholar at the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for scholars in Washington,
Soros is &quot;viewed as having more clout than Secretary of State
Warren Christopher&quot; in Eastern Europe.[40]

<p>

He created the New York-based Open Society Institute to oversee
his programs. OSI has grown from just 64 employees in 1994 to
more than 160 today.  &quot;I want to create an organization,&quot;
says Soros, &quot;that can function without me.&quot;[41] That promises
a long life for his radical drug policy views.

<p>

Soros declares the drug war lost. In his book, <I>Soros on Soros</I>,
he says, &quot;I think that the whole idea of eradicating the
drug problem is a false idea....A drug-free America is simply
not possible....Once you accept this point, you may be able to
develop a more rational approach to the problem.&quot;[42]

<p>

Ethan Nadelmann runs Soros' The Lindesmith Center in New York
and is Soros's mouthpiece on drug legalization.  Nadelmann told
the pro-drug magazine <I>High Times</I>, &quot;If by legalization
you mean it's time to make marijuana available in a regulated
way, then I am for legalization.  If you mean that we should prescribe
heroin for addicts, then, yeah, I am for legalization.  If it
means that we should legalize the personal use of drugs by adult
Americans, well, yeah, I'm for that kind of legalization.&quot;[43]

<p>

&quot;Until a couple of years ago,&quot; Nadelmann told the <I>New
York Times</I>, &quot;there was only one person in the country
giving over $100,000 to the [drug legalization] movement.&quot;
He referred to a Chicago donor named Richard Dennis.  Now, according
to Nadelmann, &quot;there are four, five, six people willing to
give $100,000 or more, of which no one is in Soros's league.&quot;
On March 8, 1996, Soros gave $200,000 to salvage California's
Proposition 215 (the medical marijuana ballot initiative).[44]

<p>

Mr. Soros has also given $6 million to the Washington, D.C.-based
Drug Policy Foundation.  Soros supports the DPF, saying, &quot;I
do think we need a more open debate [on drugs] and more humane
policies in this country....I think the DPF will play a key role
in bringing about these changes.&quot;[45]

<p>

In 1995, the DPF used the money Soros provided to make grants
to groups like the Cannabis Action Network in Berkeley, California
($25,000), New York Harm-Reduction Educators ($25,000), NORML
(two grants totaling $23,000), and the Los Angeles-based Clean
Needles Now ($25,000).[46]

<p>

The DPF frequently hosts Capitol Hill seminars to brief staffers
about drug policy.  Arnold Trebach, DPF's president and an American
University professor, showed his harm reduction colors at a Capitol
Hill seminar, explaining, &quot;[The] dominant morality is that
drug abuse is a greater threat than AIDS.&quot;[47] Trebach said
the federal government needle-exchange policy is &quot;obscene&quot;
because Congress has made the use of taxpayer money for needle
giveaways conditional on proof that syringe exchanges reduce the
spread of AIDS without encouraging drug abuse.

<p>

Clearly, wealthy men like Soros have considerable sway with some
politicians.  Soros spokesman Nadelmann told <I>Reason</I> magazine,
&quot;The replacement of the Bush administration with the Clinton
administration was generally a good thing.  It brought in a lot
of new blood, new thinking.&quot;[48] Even Clinton deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott has described Soros as &quot;a national
resource -- indeed, a national treasure.&quot;  Whether the mutual
admiration extends to drug policy remains to be seen.[49]

<p>

<center><h3>CLINTON'S HARM REDUCTION CADRE</h3></center>

<p>

This summer the White House grudgingly acknowledged past drug
use by 21 employees.  Secret Service agent Jeff Undercoffer told
a House subcommittee, &quot;I have seen cocaine usage. I have
seen hallucinogenic usages, crack usages.&quot;[50] This is in addition
to the president's and vice president's admission to past drug
use.[51] When faced with his 1992 MTV declaration, &quot;I tried
before [to inhale a marijuana cigarette],&quot; Clinton now says
he regrets the comment.

<p>

Patsy Thomasson, Director of White House administration, once
served at the right hand of Dan Lasater, who pleaded guilty to
federal drug charges.  Her past association with a convicted drug
felon impelled the Senate to vote 98-0 in June 1994 to require
the president to certify that Thomasson has no history of drug
abuse.[52]

<p>

A number of Clinton's non-White House advisors are harm reducers.
His Yale Law School mentor, Steven Duke, advocates legalizing
most illicit drugs in his 1993 book, <I>America's Longest War:
Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs</I>.[53] Even the president's
pastor, the Reverend Walter Shropshire of the Foundry United Methodist
Church, has said he believes the government would create &quot;a
safer environment for all of us&quot; if now-illicit drugs were
legalized.[54]

<p>

Clinton's 1992 campaign received drug policy advice from Mathea
Falco. Falco is now the president of Drug Strategies, a non-profit
organization funded by Soros, who gave Falco's organization a
reported $2 million in 1994.

<p>

Falco worked closely with Dr. Peter Bourne, President Carter's
drug policy chief, who fell from power after he allegedly snorted
cocaine at a National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML) party.  Dr. Bourne volunteered that &quot;about half
the White House staff&quot; had attended the NORML party &quot;looking
as though they belonged.&quot;[55]

<p>

Falco, once appointed to NORML's board of advisors, believes drug
interdiction does not work and supports medical use of marijuana
and needle exchanges.  In 1977, she told a congressional committee
that she favored marijuana decriminalization.  Falco was seriously
considered a candidate for the Clinton administration's drug czar.[56]

<p>

Mark Kleiman was hired by the administration to review the performance
of the Drug Enforcement Administration.  Kleiman is a UCLA professor
and author of <I>Against Excess,</I> which includes an endorsement
of marijuana legalization.[57] In a 1986 <I>Wall Street Journal</I>
article, he advocated marijuana legalization.  In April 1993,
Kleiman spoke at a conference sponsored by NORML, stating, &quot;The
hardest...problem...facing American drug policy is how to make
the psychedelics available...[f]or their beneficial uses to people.&quot;[58]

<p>

Kleiman continues to have inside influence.  In October 1994,
John Carnevale, director of Office of Planning and Budget, Executive
Office of the President, Office of National Drug Control Policy,
defended the drug czar's decision to employ Kleiman's services.
Carnevale said that Kleiman's organization, BOTEC, Inc., &quot;has
conducted a number of important studies over the past few years
for ONDCP, especially in the area of monitoring the emerging heroin
situation.&quot;[59] Kleiman was listed by then-drug czar Lee Brown
as one of the many &quot;expert individuals&quot; helping the
drug czar formulate the 1995 National Drug Control Strategy.

<p>

Clinton hired Joycelyn Elders as surgeon general.  She stated,
&quot;If the doctor feels that this [marijuana] is an appropriate
medication for his patients to use, I would very much support
the medication being available.&quot;[60] Marijuana has never been
scientifically shown to be either safe or effective for the treatment
of any condition.

<p>

Elders responded to a question from a member of the pro-drug Drug
Policy Foundation at a National Press Club luncheon by stating,
&quot;I do feel that we would markedly reduce our crime rate if
drugs were legalized.&quot;[61] At that time her son's 10-year cocaine
problem was not public.  Over the next year, Kevin Elders was
to be arrested and convicted for selling cocaine to an undercover
agent.  Elders and Clinton's first AIDS czar, Kristine Gebbie,
pushed needle giveaways for drug addicts.[62]

<p>

In January 1994, Philip Lee, Clinton's assistant secretary of
Health and Human Services, announced a review of the federal ban
against the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.[63] Lee's friend,
Dennis Peron, is a leader with California's 1996 marijuana legalization
ballot initiative.[64] Peron's headquarters were inside the Cannabis
Buyers' Club of San Francisco, which illegally sold marijuana
and was raided August 4 by law enforcement agencies.[65] Before Lee
took office in 1993, Peron told an LSD conference that Lee &quot;is going 
to reinstate the medical marijuana program when he is appointed.&quot;[66]

<p>

On January 23, 1996, Clinton radically reversed his drug philosophy.
He hired Army General Barry McCaffrey to mount an all-out attack
against well-entrenched drug traffickers.  This election year
turnaround came on the heels of a call by Senator Richard Shelby
(R-Ala.) for abolishing the drug czar's office.

<p>

Shelby blamed the administration for sending &quot;a mixed message
to America's youth -- a message that doing drugs is not a crime.&quot;
&quot;I object to the administration's handling of this issue,&quot;
said Shelby, &quot;[and] its lack of commitment to enforcement.&quot;[67]

<p>

Since taking office, McCaffrey has been in damage control mode.
He has patched up relations with Congress and local anti-drug
organizations.  He has re-established a tough approach to the
drug war. Not everyone believes this paradigm shift will last,
however. The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> has editorialized that
a second Clinton term will find McCaffrey job hunting.[68]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Harm reduction is a failed philosophy, much as the &quot;safe
sex&quot; approach has failed to slow the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases among young Americans.  A balanced effort to reduce both
the supply of and demand for drugs worked in the past and will
work again.

<p>

Drug policy has seen at least two historic flip-flops over the
past few decades, each with tragic results.  Under President Richard
Nixon strong interdiction and the creation of the DEA, coupled
with solid demand-reduction efforts, crippled the illicit drug
trade and abuse plummeted.  By contrast, President Jimmy Carter
embraced a harm-reduction philosophy which led to historic levels
of abuse.  Carter's legacy was reversed by Nancy Reagan's &quot;just
say no&quot; campaign.

<p>

The start-up of a serious drug war began during the Reagan-Bush
years, characterized by stiff interdiction balanced with locally
run demand reduction.  The Clinton administration's harm reduction
approach has once again turned policy on its head.  Hopefully,
Mr. Clinton has seen the error of his first three years and General
McCaffrey's tough, anti-harm-reduction approach is indicative
of a renewed seriousness about fighting drugs.

<CENTER><B>Tax Pledge to Small Business A Decisive Factor in '96<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- Taxes will remain the number one issue for small businesses in the 1996 elections, and individuals seeking public office who pledge not to raise taxes while advocating fundamental tax reform will fare better with this large and growing constituency according to a national small business advocacy organization.
<P>
"With high taxes and a burdensome tax system impeding the growth and survival of small businesses at ever stage of their development, you can bet that this issue will be a priority for each and every small business person who votes on November 5," said Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan made her remarks on Capitol Hill today at a press conference with a coalition of groups supporting the Taxpayer Protection Pledge -- an effort sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform.  When signed by a Member of Congress or candidate for public office, the Pledge commits the signer to oppose and vote against any effort to raise the federal income tax on individuals or corporations.
<P>
"In 1992 Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut, instead middle-class small business owners got hit with the biggest tax increase in history.  President Clinton made a campaign promise to cut taxes, instead he raised them.  Taking the Pledge separates the true friend of the taxpayer from the big tax and spenders," said Kerrigan.
<P>
According to SBSC, small business owners are drawn towards elected officials and candidates who support tax system reform -- changes that would encourage risk-taking, investment and job creation rather than the attributes of the current system which punish entrepreneurial activities.
<P>
"Taxes are still a hot issue despite what the political pundits say.  Pledge signers, and those who make tax reform a key issue of their campaign have a tremendous advantage over their political challengers," added Kerrigan.
<P>
SBSC is a nationwide, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization.  For additional information please call <B>Renee Stikes</B> at<B> (202)-785-0238</B>.

<center><h2>TIME FOR A GROWN UP RESPONSE TO DRUGS,<br>
SAYS BAUER</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The adolescent attitude towards
drug use which ignores the life-threatening nature of the problem
must stop,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary Bauer
said Friday, as news of the HUD drug scandal began to unfold.

<p>

The <I>Washington Post</I> reported Friday that members of Congress
were questioning a Housing and Urban Development project that
did not eject people who used drugs on federal property. And,
that at least one organization, the Salvation Army, that applied
for grant money was rejected because it would not accept the provision
concerning on-site drug use.

<p>

&quot;This week we're being told by former Surgeon General Joyceln
Elders that the Clinton administration has plans outlined for
needle exchange programs in Clinton's second term. Now we learn
that drug use in a taxpayer-funded housing project was being purposefully
ignored.

<p>

&quot;It's time for a grown up response to the drug problem. It's
time we send a clear signal to our most valuable resource -- our
children -- about the danger of drugs,&quot; Bauer said.

<p>

PROGRAMS AND OTHER CURRENT DRUG ISSUES, CALL THE FRC MEDIA OFFICE

<title> How Government Wastes Your Money: Report No. 3 - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>How Government Wastes Your Money:
Report No. 3</h3>

Compiled by Ronald D. Utt, Senior Fellow <br>
Daniel J. Hickey, Special Assistant to the Vice President for Domestic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 123<br>
October 15, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>

</center>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Earlier this century, H. L. Mencken, the Baltimore journalist and wit, is said to have described government as "a broker in pillage, and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods." While that may have characterized government spending in a simpler time when human motives seemed more straightforward than today, one can only wonder whether even Mencken's immense wit and cynicism would have been up to the task of trying to make sense of the bizarre collection of federal financial abuses described below. As politicians of both parties approach this election with various proposals to cut taxes, and pundits wonder how Americans can pay for them, this month's report offers more instances of waste and excess that could be used as a down payment on promised tax relief.
<p>
<b>Don't Leave Home Without It</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Smart Cards will lead to Smarter Government," a Clinton official said when promoting Vice President Albert Gore's <a href="http://www.npr.gov/index.html">National Performance Review</a> recommendation that government agencies make greater use of credit cards to pay for employee business travel. The Vice President apparently pushed this idea without realizing that the government's bookkeeping capability has not advanced much beyond techniques available to Bob Cratchit and Bartleby the Scrivener. But government employees knew exactly how little oversight there would be, and misuse and fraud have accompanied the program.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One hotbed of misuse is the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA was targeted for termination by Congress, but President Clinton successfully resisted--to the relief of the agency's traveling bureaucrats. Commerce's Inspector General reported (Audit Report No. EAD-7129-5-0001/September 1995) that NOAA exceeded its travel budget by 84 percent in 1994 and that numerous employees misused the government travel card with "excessive unpaid charges, use of the card for personal purchases, and questionable automatic teller advances." According to the IG's report, such misuse included payments for meals at Washington-area restaurants and the purchase of liquor, jewelry, flowers, books, music, computer on-line service fees, and automobile insurance. Between 5,000 and 6,000 NOAA employees have such cards. According to the Inspector General, "A primary reason for the abuse is a lack of management and oversight by the agencies."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> D. James Baker, Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmospheres, U.S. Department of Commerce, (202) 482-3436.
<p>
<b>Public Housing Sings the Blues - Again</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Department of <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Housing and Urban Development's</a> 1.3 million public housing units represent some of the worst housing in America, and the worst of the worst may well be the 13,000 units operated by the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO), the seventh-largest housing authority in the nation. Officially designated "troubled" in 1979, HANO has defied all efforts to correct its manifest deficiencies, even after the investment of a staggering $244 million in federal subsidies over the last three years. As recently as 1994, HUD's Inspector General reported that a random sample of 150 of HANO's housing units found that all 150 failed to meet HUD's housing quality standards. Typical problems included missing ceilings, holes in walls, loose and peeling paint, and roach infestation. A follow-up random survey in 1995, however, did find some improvement--only 93 percent of the sampled units failed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Why the persistent failure to improve this project? The chief reasons may well be the local housing authority's gross mismanagement and misplaced priorities. Despite a maintenance backlog estimated at 36,000 individual work orders, and despite the availability of only one pickup truck for work crews who serviced nine of HANO's ten projects, HANO's management purchased 16 new Ford LTD Crown Victoria passenger vehicles for the central office staff in 1993. Also in that year, HANO's board awarded a $164,000 contract to a joint venture between HANO's former board chairman and a former management contractor who earlier had failed to make good on a $75,000 debt to the authority. Such failings make it easier to understand why the nation's public housing authorities fight so vigorously against federal proposals to replace them with housing vouchers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Kevin E. Marchman, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, (202) 708-0950.
<p>
<b>Not Covered by Welfare Reform</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It was revealed recently that Sam Donaldson, one of the most highly paid correspondents on ABC News, received U.S. <a href="http://www.usda.gov/">Department of Agriculture</a> subsidies of $97,000 over the past two years to help with the mohair sheep he raised on his New Mexico ranch. Now he's back in line for a new government benefit, this time asking the federal government's Animal Damage Control program to help him eradicate the pesky coyotes that keep eating his subsidized sheep on land he leases from the state government for less than a dollar an acre. The <i>Dallas Morning News</i> quotes Mr. Donaldson as saying recently: "The government helps ranchers and farmers and businesses of all kinds. If it's in existence and I'm eligible to use it, I'll use it."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	This attitude apparently is shared by Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, which went Sam one better with its 1,600-acre farm in Georgia, described by <i>The Washington Post</i> as having "no barn, no fence, only a cinder-block shed and a double-wide trailer home that was knocked off its moorings by a tornado this spring. The land was dotted with rusted farm implements, dented fuel barrels, mangled trailers, [and] a fragile pickup truck." The farm nevertheless received a payment of $36,977 last year from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for <i>not</i> growing crops on 821 acres of its land. The Heritage Foundation estimates that last year, approximately 259 million other Americans joined Mr. Farrakhan in not growing crops, and might therefore be eligible for the same no-grow government bonus. Prospective beneficiaries may call Mr. Grant B. Buntrock at (202) 720-3467 to determine their eligibility for the payment and to receive information on how to become eligible for the no-grow bonus in the future. Buntrock is the Administrator of the Farm Service Agency, the USDA division that operates the bonus program.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Daniel Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture, (202) 720-3631.
<p>
<b>More Than a Million Dollars a Minute</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even with a federal subsidy of $750 million per year, equaling $47 per passenger, <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/">Amtrak</a> still loses millions. On August 10, 1996, Amtrak announced that an expected $250 million deficit forced it to eliminate three train routes and service to 42 towns and cities. But while Amtrak was shutting down its service to Boise and Dallas, it was trying to start up a costly new service between Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine. Although that route is already served by a taxpaying private bus company that offers a two hour ride for $15 per trip, Amtrak proposes to spend $40 million of taxpayer money to offer competing service. According to railroad experts in Massachusetts, the new Amtrak service will take two and one-half hours to make the trip -- 30 minutes longer than the private bus that now serves the route.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's In Charge:</b> Gordon J. Linton, Administrator, Federal Transit Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, (202) 366-4040.
<p>
<b>U.S. Taxpayers Fund Egyptian Obituaries</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Each year, the United States provides Egypt with more than $815 million in foreign aid. Despite this vast financial assistance, however, Egypt remains a poor country, largely because of its commitment to failed socialist principles and the U.S. government's apparent indifference to this commitment. Egypt also maintains a huge bureaucracy whose employees are estimated to work approximately 27 minutes per day -- which may explain why they have become so dependent on U.S. welfare, why Egypt is the 48th-poorest country in the world, and why half its population is unable to read.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Internal Agency for International Development (AID) reports reveal that substantial amounts of American aid to Egypt -- up to one-third of the total spent on some projects -- are lost through gross misuse of the money. Take for example the $3.4 million provided to, and spent by, the National Bank for Development in Cairo. According to AID's auditor, more than $1 million of what the bank spent was used for questionable purposes, with $693,000 of this amount deemed ineligible and $329,900 described as unsupported. AID heavily censored most of the dollar figures in the report provided to Heritage, but there was enough information to deduce that much of the wasted money appeared to benefit personally many of the Egyptian Bank officials directly involved in the project.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chief among the ineligible expenditures were bonuses paid to the Bank's chairman, project director, and senior officers. Although the amounts taken by members of this group were censored by AID, the auditor did note that they "appear excessive considering the loan fund has just recently reached operational break even." Bonuses also were paid to more junior bank employees and project employees. According to AID's October 1, 1995, Report No. 6-263-96-001-N, taken together these ineligible bonuses cost the U.S. taxpayer $629,000. Other ineligible expenses incurred by bank employees and officials included costs of parties, gifts, obituaries in newspapers, flowers, tips, radios, meals, entertainment, conference prizes, and new clothes for Bank employees to wear to a population development conference.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
East of Cairo, in the Gaza Strip bordering Israel, is the headquarters of the AID-funded Society for the Care of the Handicapped in the Gaza Strip. According to the audit, $1.5 million of the Society's $9 million budget was spent on ineligible or unsupported purposes, including an apartment in Arlington, Virginia, for the Society's Palestinian chairman. According to AID audit Report No. 6-294-96-006-N, the chairman billed AID for the apartment's rent, security, "significant" telephone charges, and maid service; the cost of an automobile (including traffic fines and parking tickets); medical costs for his family; and cable TV. He also illegally billed the U.S. for travel expenses to his Virginia getaway (including airfare for his wife), other living expenses beyond those described above, and a gun for his Palestinian bodyguard. In response to the audit findings, the chairman claimed that "Cable TV was needed because only CNN produced quick and detailed accounts of what was happening in the occupied territories."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> J. Brian Atwood, Director, U.S. International Development Cooperation Agency, (202) 647-9620.
<p>
<b>Food Stamps for Caviar</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This year, the government will spend over $26.3 billion on the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/fcs/fs.htm">Food Stamp Program</a>. More than 10 percent -- approximately $3 billion -- of this amount will be lost to fraud and abuse, according to testimony by Roger A. Viadero, Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. One reason is that "food stores" accepting food stamps can be in the program without any required preauthorization visits. Once a store is authorized to accept stamps, visits by inspectors are rare and fraud is frequent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In one instance, a South Carolina retailer redeemed over $300,000 worth of food stamps over a two-year period despite the fact that the only "store" he owned was a fleet of 12 ice cream trucks. Across the country, in Los Angeles, California, a liquor store was removed from the program after an inspection revealed that its food inventory consisted of a few containers of milk and a limited supply of canned goods with expiration dates long passed. Further north, in Alameda County, a pizza parlor was authorized to accept food stamps even though it did not sell foods for home preparation. An employee told government investigators that the store was not authorized to accept the stamps but still averaged $3,500 a month in food stamp sales.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The behavior of some of the nation's 25 million food stamp recipients accounts for the rest of the abuse, as demonstrated by a <i>New York Post</i> report that a New York couple bought over $120 worth of caviar at a grocery store using food stamps, then sold the product at a flea market for a profit. Skeptical cashiers checked the regulations on allowable purchases and found that food stamps can indeed be used to purchase caviar. It turns out that the actions of the couple were not illegal. Elsewhere, a transient was able to collect $21,000 in food stamps from 16 states over a three-and-a-half-year period by traveling from city to city by bus for a few weeks each month and applying for the stamps under an assumed name. The man would wait the required waiting period for application approval and then make a return trip to collect the stamps. While travel was inconvenient, he told investigators that "getting the stamps was easy." In Tennessee, a woman with assets valued at over $350,000 was charged in August of this year with illegally receiving $27,000 in food stamps and welfare benefits over a three-and-a-half-year period. Her husband is president of a security company.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Yvette S. Jackson, Deputy Administrator, Food Stamp Program, U.S. Department of Agriculture, (703)305-2026. The public is encouraged to report violations of the food stamp program by calling 1-800-424-9121, the toll-free number for the USDA's Inspector General in Washington, D.C.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An activist labor movement may be the most significant new force in American politics, but the agenda of labor's new leaders is radically different from that of the traditional labor movement. Curiously, much of this new agenda is unconnected with workplace issues, not generally supported among rank-and-file union members, and clearly outside the mainstream of American politics. In recent decades, organized labor has been transformed from a relatively centrist political force into a powerful lobby for liberal special interests and big government. Organized labor has decided to use its billions of dollars in dues revenue to defeat conservative Members of Congress, while also encouraging the Boy Scouts to admit homosexuals and atheists, offering financial contributions to political groups that promote abortion, and opposing welfare reform and a balanced budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While political parties have moved to the center and right, union activism has shifted decisively to the left. This transformation has occurred in tandem with a historic change in union membership from private-sector, largely industrial workers toward government and service employees. Unions began organizing the public sector in the 1960s and 1970s to offset a continuing decline in membership, particularly in manufacturing. New AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, the first federation leader from a government employee-dominated union, came to power when his coalition of service and public-sector unions toppled former president Lane Kirkland and his industry-based allies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The desires of government employees, however, have proven to be in conflict with the interests of blue-collar workers, who now get billed twice for big government: Thanks to their unions' lobbying efforts, private-sector workers pay high taxes to support bloated bureaucracies in Washington and state capitals around the country. Meanwhile, union dues are used to support political causes that are irrelevant to the bread-and-butter interests of the average worker. There is no evidence that the new union leadership's radical political campaign will do anything but accelerate the exit of union members, especially in the private sector. Workers who once formed the backbone of the American labor movement now find themselves paying higher and higher fees to unions that are paying less and less attention to the real interests of their members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fairness, it should be easier than it now is for union members to opt out of radical politicking by obtaining a refund of the significant portion of their dues that is used to support such efforts. In view of organized labor's growing politicization, policymakers should re-examine the unique privileges that have been granted to unions.

<p>
<b>THE POLITICAL TRADITION OF AMERICAN LABOR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Writing over a decade ago in <i>Policy Review</i>, labor analyst Max Green decried the full-scale embrace of Walter Mondale's presidential candidacy by Lane Kirkland, the AFL-CIO's president from 1979-1995.<sup>2</sup>  Green argued that Kirkland's actions, taken at the behest of public employee unions, represented the ultimate rejection of the ideas of American Federation of Labor founder Samuel Gompers. Gompers made sure that labor kept "its distance both from socialism and from partisan politics," focusing instead on organizing and winning concessions from business through collective bargaining. In the first half of this century, the AFL even refused to support minimum-wage legislation. In those days, labor was committed to the market economy and "opted for what Gompers and his associates called `trade unionism pure and simple,' the collective-bargaining strategy on which workers of every political stripe could agree."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If labor unions did take a political stand, it was generally centrist, especially on social issues. In 1968, when the United Auto Workers threatened to leave the AFL-CIO because of AFL-CIO founder George Meany's opposition to an alliance with activist left intellectuals and students, Meany bid the UAW good riddance. In 1972, labor unions joined with the Coalition for a Democratic Majority, a group established to move the Democratic Party to the center, but abandoned the effort in 1974 in order to concentrate once again on economic issues. The colorful Alan Barkan, AFL-CIO political director in 1972, denounced the McGovernites for turning the Democratic Party into the "party of acid, amnesty, and abortion."<sup>4</sup>

<p>
<b>DECLINING MEMBERSHIP AND THE TURN TO GOVERNMENT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For all the media focus on upheaval in the AFL-CIO, the federation's political aggressiveness and renewed emphasis on organizing have neither stemmed declines in union membership nor markedly improved working conditions; "wage growth is at historically sluggish levels, and labor's share of the growing national income is currently at its lowest level in two decades."<sup>5</sup>  In spite of these trends, workers apparently do not see joining unions as a remedy. In the mid-1950s, 35 percent of America's workers were unionized; today, fewer than 15 percent belong to unions. Leo Troy, a labor economist at Rutgers University, notes that unions have lost 7.5 million members since 1970, largely in the shrinking industrial sector.<sup>6</sup>  In response to these declining numbers, unions have attempted to bring more public employees into the fold. Of the 16.4 million union members in America, 6.9 million work directly for federal, state, and local governments.<sup>7</sup>  Despite the aggressive efforts of numerous AFL-CIO affiliates to recruit government workers, however, Sweeney has been forced to admit failure: "We are still losing members as an absolute number, and as a percentage of the workforce."<sup>8</sup>  In fact, the number of union members fell from 16.7 million in 1994 to 16.4 million last year.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO altered its moderate political stance as it moved beyond the shrinking manufacturing sector. As the union movement has grown more dependent on the public sector, it has moved squarely into the liberal camp, forging the very alliances that Gompers and Meany had shunned.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In October 1995, public employee unions such as the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and Service Employees' International Union (SEIU) spearheaded a successful rebellion to depose Lane Kirkland as president of the AFL-CIO. John Sweeney, head of the SEIU, became the first AFL-CIO president from a largely public-sector union, completing the federation's transformation from a voice for workers in negotiating with management into one of the nation's principal defenders of big government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The labor movement's efforts to organize public employees may do more for big government than for private-sector union members, who would benefit from balanced budgets, lower taxes, and less intrusive government. Although bloated bureaucracies might be in the interest of a federal employee in Washington, D.C., or a municipal employee in Cleveland, Ohio, the man or woman on the automobile assembly line in Hamtramck, Michigan, benefits directly from lower taxes. Deficit spending comes out of their paychecks. By siding disproportionately with the interests of government employees, the AFL-CIO is neglecting the millions in its ranks who work in the private sector.
<p>
<b>LURCHING LEFTWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

More significant than its defense of big government is organized labor's continuing leftward lurch on a broad array of issues. Liberal activists have captured the union movement and are using its influence to move the Democratic Party to the left by "controlling the debate," as AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Richard Trumka puts it.10  Trumka and other AFL-CIO officials, for example, regularly denounce the so-called New Democrats who have sought to move the party away from its traditional big-government agenda. Trumka has decried the agenda of the Democratic Leadership Council, the leading organization of centrist Democrats, as "immoral ... anti-worker [and] a blueprint for political disaster."<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The AFL-CIO's "Union Summer" project, originally designed to train 1,000 young people to become union organizers, also is being used for "voter education and registration" as well as to fight the California Civil Rights Initiative.<sup>12</sup>  This shift epitomizes the transformation from recruitment to politicking. It is not surprising, however, considering that Union Summer's director, Andrew Levin, boasts of having made a career of "apartheid, anti-nuclear, environment, civil rights, community organizing, union organizing, and student protest" activism.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO has become a leading funder of liberal causes, lending its rhetoric, foot soldiers, and coffers to a variety of movements. Under Sweeney, this shift to the left has accelerated, leaving organized labor outside the political mainstream on issues ranging from racial preferences to sexual preferences, tax policy, and protecting American national interests abroad:
<p><ul>
<li> The AFL-CIO has strongly opposed the $500-per-child tax credit.
<p>
<li> The National Education Association, United Auto Workers, and AFL-CIO have lobbied against legislation to make English America's official language.
<p>
<li> Several AFL-CIO unions have donated thousands of dollars to Emily's List and other pro-abortion political action committees.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1996 election cycle, as part of their drive to control the debate, the activists who have captured the AFL-CIO have not hesitated to use workers' hard-earned dues money to fund their aggressive political campaign. The AFL-CIO has pledged to spend $35 million -- seven times the amount it normally spends in an election year -- in an effort to unseat 75 conservative Members of Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The AFL-CIO's new leaders are pushing a cultural and economic agenda that does not represent the views of the federation's members. In some cases, labor leaders have taken positions directly counter to the interests of working families. Often, they have chosen to highlight issues with no relevance to collective bargaining, taking advantage of their roles and organizational resources to advance their own agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For instance, the leadership of the Detroit chapter of AFSCME passed an emergency resolution last year condemning the death sentence meted out to a man convicted of murdering a police officer in Pennsylvania.<sup>14</sup>  As leader of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney has continued this trend. In a March 1995 address to Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition, for instance, Sweeney declared "that as long as I am president of our federation, the AFL-CIO will `be there' for you."<sup>15</sup>  Yet Jackson remains one of the most controversial figures in American politics; a December 1995 <i>Wall Street Journal</i>/NBC News poll showed that of 2,007 Americans polled, 46 percent viewed Jackson either somewhat negatively or very negatively, compared to just 26 percent who viewed him either very positively or somewhat positively.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider some of organized labor's recent stances on issues wholly unrelated to collective bargaining:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Homosexuality:</b> Joe Velasquez, Director of Community Services for the AFL-CIO, led a 1995 campaign to force the Boy Scouts of America to include homosexuals and atheists. Velasquez even lectured the Boy Scouts about the need to reexamine their views and "decide if they are living up to their mission of teaching America's children the values that made this country great."<sup>17</sup>  AFL-CIO affiliates in Colorado and Maine took leading roles in campaigns to oppose efforts in those states to outlaw ordinances that would have given homosexuals special constitutional privileges. Other unions have taken an active role in promoting homosexual rights through donations to political action committees. Since 1993, AFSCME has donated over $5,000 to the Human Rights Campaign Fund, which promotes homosexual "marriage."  The Service Employees International Union has pushed actively for spousal rights for homosexual partners.<sup>18</sup>  All of this despite the fact that over 80 percent of Americans support a law banning same-sex marriages.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<b>Abortion:</b> William Hamilton, Jr., who ran the Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Washington office for 13 years, now directs the legislative and political program of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.<sup>20</sup>  Hamilton was one of 12 members of the AFL-CIO Political Action Transition Workgroup, which decided to launch the effort to defeat 75 conservative members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996.<sup>21</sup>  Through its various political action committees, the union movement has funded several pro-abortion groups. Earlier this year, AFSCME donated $5,000 to Americans for Freedom of Choice. Over the past three years, Emily's List has received contributions of $2,500 from the AFL-CIO, $5,000 from the NEA, $10,000 from AFSCME, $5,000 from the Communications Workers of America, $7,500 from the SEIU, and $7,000 from the UAW. Voters for Choice has accepted $7,000 from AFSCME and $4,000 from the NEA. The NEA also donated $2,500 to the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. The Women's Campaign Fund has taken money from numerous unions, including AFSCME ($5,000), the AFL-CIO ($4,000), the CWA ($7,500), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ($15,000), the Letter Carriers ($6,000), the UAW ($15,000), and the UMW ($5,500).<sup>22</sup>  AFSCME was sued earlier this year by Edward P. Kelly, a devout Roman Catholic who objected to the use of union funds to lobby for abortion rights.<sup>23</sup>  A federal judge ruled that AFSCME had violated Mr. Kelly's religious liberties under the 1964 Civil Rights Act and allowed him to donate part of his agency fees to a charitable organization instead.
<p>
<b>Racial and Gender Preferences:</b> Polls indicate that over 80 percent of Americans -- black and white -- oppose racial preferences,<sup>24</sup> but the AFL-CIO staunchly supports these measures, using union members' dues to support programs that will discriminate against members and their families.<sup>25</sup>  The UAW lobbied against H.R. 2128, a bill to eliminate federal affirmative action programs,<sup>26</sup> and several unions are organizing to oppose the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would end racial preferences in public education, government hiring, and government contracts. The California Teachers Association, the United Farm Workers, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and local affiliates of the American Federation of Teachers, the SEIU, and the AFL-CIO all plan to publish pamphlets and man phone banks to get out the vote against the CCRI.
<p>
<b>English as Official Language:</b> Despite the fact that eight out of ten Americans support making English the official language, several national and international unions, including the UAW, the NEA, and the AFL-CIO, have opposed legislation to implement the idea.<sup>27</sup>  The AFL-CIO Executive Council declared that it was "deeply disturbed" by the U. S. House of Representatives' passage of the English as the Official Language of Government Act, claiming that the law "would weaken the federal government's ability to deal effectively with the challenges of living in a global age."<sup>28</sup>
<p>
<b>Welfare:</b> In a recent poll of 1,000 union members, 87 percent voiced support for welfare reform that both requires recipients to work and limits the amount of time someone may receive welfare checks.<sup>29</sup>  Nevertheless, labor unions have tapped into the dues of their members to assure that the indolent not have to seek employment. In its year-end report for 1995, AFSCME has bragged about its work with the American Civil Liberties Union in suing various state and local agencies concerning welfare issues.<sup>30</sup>  AFSCME has been particularly aggressive in opposing time limits on cash payments and in fighting workfare, the concept that welfare recipients should work for benefits.<sup>31</sup>  John Sweeney described the recently passed welfare reform bill as "anti-poor, anti-immigrants, anti-women and anti-children," and said that it was a "sad day" when President Clinton signed it.<sup>32</sup>  The AFL-CIO also has decried attempts to prohibit alcohol and drug addicts from receiving welfare through Supplemental Security Income (SSI).<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<b>The Federal Budget:</b> Some 82 percent of union members surveyed support amending the Constitution to require Congress to balance the budget.<sup>34</sup>  Yet the AFL-CIO leadership opposes a balanced budget amendment.<sup>35</sup>  The average working family pays thousands of dollars a year in taxes simply to pay the interest on the national debt, but the AFL-CIO and its allies have chosen to side with the status quo and leave working families to pay the bill. According to a February 1995 AFSCME Legislative Alert, "President McEntee and Secretary-Treasurer Lucy have announced that defeat of the Balanced Budget Amendment is our number one national legislative priority. It is urgent that you call your Senators and urge them to vote `NO' on <i>any</i> version of the balanced budget amendment."<sup>36</sup>  Moreover, says the AFL-CIO, "We strongly oppose the [$500-per-child tax credit and other] tax provisions of the `Contract with America.'"<sup>37</sup>  Given the fact that 78 percent of union members support the tax credit, one wonders just who the AFL-CIO means by "we."<sup>38</sup>
<p>
<b>Christian Conservatives and New Age Religion:</b> As part of its efforts to "build solidarity among many kinds of movements,"<sup>39</sup> organized labor gave its blessing to an April 1996 "Summit on Ethics and Meaning" organized by Michael Lerner, a 1960s radical who has emerged more recently as a sort of New Age "politics of meaning" guru to Hillary Clinton.<sup>40</sup>  AFL-CIO President Sweeney was the featured dinner speaker at the conference, which was convened by, among others, People for the American Way, the <i>Utne Reader</i>, the Institute for Policy Studies, and Planned Parenthood of America's Clergy Advisory Board. In his speech, Sweeney declared that participants in the conference were the "core of a progressive coalition that will expand the frontiers of social justice."  One of key goals of the conference was to educate the public about "the deprivation of meaning in daily life and how our hunger for meaning is used and manipulated by racist, xenophobic, nationalist, fascist and fundamentalist religious groups in ways that set people against each other."<sup>41</sup>  The AFL-CIO's bias was made even clearer by an attack in the <i>AFL-CIO News</i> on the Christian Coalition, the American Family Association, Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, and the National Association of Christian Educators. The <i>AFL-CIO News</i> alleged that these "religious extremists pose a significant threat to those candidates who would best represent America's working families."<sup>42</sup>  At the same time, the AFL-CIO and the Letter Carriers union have given political action committee donations to the quasi-religious Natural Law Party.<sup>43</sup>  This party, founded by adherents of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, claims that a few government-run centers for Transcendental Meditation would reduce crime, illness, terrorism, and war by reducing the global stress level.<sup>44</sup>  Professionals skilled in this meditative technique allegedly can become smarter, halt the aging process, and levitate.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many union members do not agree with such extreme positions. AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson admitted earlier this year that "labor was all over the place [in 1994]: taking positions on gun control, on abortion. Those issues affect us, but our membership told us in surveys that they felt we were not concentrating enough on bread-and-butter issues: pay increases, job security, a better tomorrow for them and their families."<sup>45</sup>  When union members are evenly split on a controversial issue that has little to do with their standard of living, their leaders should avoid taking either a conservative or a liberal position. At the very least, members should not be forced to finance causes they oppose.

<p>
<b>SWEENEY'S FIRST YEAR: LABOR SOCIALISM IN ACTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The union movement is gradually adopting the tactics of European-style labor socialism. In a December 1995 speech, Sweeney offered the following insight into his thought: "I was in Europe last week, traveling with President Clinton, and I couldn't help but be impressed with what is going on in France. In this country, when we're faced with cuts in vital services that benefit workers and the poor, we shut down a few parts of the government. In France, the workers shut down the country -- even though only 8 percent of the work force is organized!"<sup>46</sup>  Sweeney's admiration for the efforts of the French Communist-backed General Confederation of Labor and its stranglehold on many of France's key public-sector agencies is an ominous indication of the AFL-CIO's political agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The New Voice platform on which Sweeney ran for the AFL-CIO presidency promised to "challenge the right-wing domination of the media in politics."<sup>47</sup>  This unusual claim shows just how far out of the political mainstream Sweeney and his colleagues are. In a recent Roper Center survey of Washington print correspondents and bureau chiefs, only 2 percent described themselves as conservative, compared to 91 percent who saw themselves as liberal to moderate.<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This vision of American politics is not surprising given Sweeney's political history. <i>Democratic Left</i>, a publication of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), boasts that Sweeney is a card-carrying DSA member.<sup>49</sup>  The DSA, founded by avowed socialist Michael Harrington, seeks to establish "an openly socialist presence in American communities and politics."  While running for AFL-CIO President, Sweeney worked closely with the DSA by picketing the Columbus office of House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-OH).<sup>50</sup>  The DSA, moreover, is urging youth involvement in Sweeney's Union Summer project: "single-issue progressive young activists have all found a home in unions. And through the labor movement, those activists have learned the connectedness of various forms of oppression and exploitation."<sup>51</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the leadership of George Meany and even Lane Kirkland, the AFL-CIO supported the Cold War and military intervention, if necessary, to protect American national interests. The DSA, a bastion of the very type of "blame America first" thinking that Meany, in particular, condemned, opposed U.S. foreign policy in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Persian Gulf. Although Sweeney has issued few statements on foreign policy, it is worth noting that in January 1991, when he was head of the SEIU, he and Steve Rosenthal, now the AFL-CIO's political director, spearheaded a coalition of labor leaders opposed to the Gulf War.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sweeney and the rest of the new AFL-CIO leadership have even been praised by the Communist Party, U.S.A., a virulent critic of the federation under George Meany's leadership. "Headed by President John Sweeney," writes CPUSA National Chairman Gus Hall, "the new leadership is also involved in a process of radicalization and militancy that is already evident in the activities and commitment of resources in the election campaign, organizing the unorganized and the campaign to win a higher minimum wage."<sup>52</sup>  Reflecting on various speeches at the AFL-CIO convention (including Sweeney's), Hall wrote that "The radical shift in both leadership and policy is a very positive, even historic change. We do not want to take any credit for the shift, but our Party has advocated class struggle policies throughout its 75 years."<sup>53</sup>

<p>
<b>POLITICAL EXPLOITATION OF UNION MEMBERS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The shift from collective bargaining to aggressive political activism has not been limited to issuing cultural manifestos and press releases. Several unions have become heavily involved in partisan politics as well. Despite the fact that union members split their vote roughly 60-40 between the two major parties in 1994, the AFL-CIO has launched an overwhelmingly partisan $35 million "voter education project," funded mainly by mandatory union dues, to defeat conservative members of the 104th Congress. In the words of AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal, the 40 percent who supported Republicans simply voted "wrong."<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unions played a key role at the 1996 Democratic National Convention. NEA President Keith Geiger spoke at the convention and was preaching largely to the choir: 405 NEA members were among the approximately 5,000 delegates.<sup>55</sup>  In addition to that huge total, 889 other delegates came from 44 different international unions, according to the AFL-CIO.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO leadership's efforts to re-elect President Clinton undoubtedly will continue through the fall. Executive Vice-President Linda Chavez-Thompson proclaimed at a union rally that "we will not have a day of rest until Bill Clinton and Al Gore are back in the White House."<sup>57</sup>  Other unions, including the SEIU, plan to close their headquarters in late October and use their staff for a get-out-the-vote effort. This blatant partisanship would be illegal if undertaken by any other type of organization. Even more important, however, it does nothing to advance the economic interests of working-class families.
<p>
<b>LABOR'S LEFT WING</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The nation's largest union, the National Education Association, epitomizes labor's leftward political tilt. At its 1995 annual convention, delegates passed a resolution stating that "the NEA believes that the following programs and practices are detrimental to public education and must be eliminated: privatization, performance contracting, tax credits for tuition to private and parochial schools, voucher plans... and evaluations by private, profit making groups."<sup>58</sup>  The NEA also has been outspoken in supporting multiculturalism, bilingual education, condom distribution, and abortion. With public school education in a downward spiral, the NEA should be concentrating on stopping this decline; instead, it is pursuing a partisan political agenda. The NEA employs nearly 1,500 people to organize teachers to participate in political activity.<sup>59</sup>  Clearly, though, it is the close financial ties between the NEA and the Democratic Party that should be of the greatest concern to dues-paying members. "In 1994, [the NEA] gave 99 percent of its PAC money -- about $2.27 million -- to Democrats" despite the fact that 30 percent of NEA members are Republicans.<sup>60</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Several unions are trying to push the AFL-CIO even farther to the left. The United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers, the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, and the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers used union dues to finance last month's founding convention of the Labor Party, a new organization which plans to compete with the Democratic Party on the left.<sup>61</sup>

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>

The National Labor Relations Act, the basic federal legislation governing labor unions, empowers unions to provide on-the-job representation for workers in terms of wages, benefits, and working conditions. The AFL-CIO's new leaders have shunned this role, preferring to serve as spokesmen for and financial supporters of an activist political agenda. Politicking and other non-collective bargaining activities cost the average union member hundreds of dollars per year in dues.62  The labor movement needs to return to basics and concentrate on representing union workers in collective bargaining with management. If organized labor is unwilling to return to its chartered role as collective bargaining agent, then union privileges should be re-examined.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although unions have a right to participate in politics, they should not finance their political activities through compulsory membership dues. Simple fairness demands that union leaders not be permitted to exact dues from members and then divert union resources to political causes many of those members do not support. The U. S. Constitution itself protects workers against such abuses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In a 1988 decision, <i>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</i>, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that union members are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment.<sup>63</sup>  But these traditional union functions may represent only a small fraction of today's union spending; in a case involving the NEA and two of its affiliates, for example, the union was able to justify only 10 percent of its general treasury funds as chargeable to bargaining activities.<sup>64</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Labor unions are supposed to defend the rights of working men and women, not trample them: The law says that workers should have this money returned to them if they wish. The Luntz survey cited above showed that 78 percent of union workers were unaware that they had the right to a refund of the portion of their mandatory dues that goes to political activity. The same survey revealed that 56 percent of those union members would be likely to request a refund rather than let labor leaders use the money to advance their own political agenda.<sup>65</sup>  The number of members who would ask for refunds probably would increase substantially if members knew that labor leaders were spending their dues money to fight tax cuts for working families, welfare reform that requires recipients to work, and a balanced budget--all of which rank-and-file members support overwhelmingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tide may be starting to turn. John Joyce, head of the International Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, recently refused to join in the AFL-CIO's endorsement of President Clinton for re-election. Spurred by the President's veto of a bill that would have banned partial-birth abortions, Joyce said that while labor leaders should be taking positions on economic issues, "union members do not necessarily want or expect union leaders to take a position on issues, like abortion or gun control, where there's no obvious connection to their lives as a union member."<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While labor unions have a right to get involved in politics, they should not use compulsory membership dues to finance a specific political agenda. Labor leaders are free to associate with such groups as the Democratic Socialists of America, the Natural Law Party, or Planned Parenthood; but as the Supreme Court declared in <i>Beck</i>, they have no business trying to compel millions of union members to support this extreme political agenda with mandatory union dues.

<H3>Three items today:</H3>
<p>
<ol><br><ol>
<li><a href="#moderate">By sticking to a moderate course in the debate</a> and
avoiding scandal topics that would enrage the media, Bob
Dole largely avoided media condemnation and earned praise
for his humor. But, not from everyone. NBC's Lisa Myers
tagged him as "harsh," CBS reporter Phil Jones said Dole
failed to explain how we can "afford" his tax cut and CNN's
Judy Woodruff asked Al Gore if Dole was "too negative."
<li><a href="#hunt">This past weekend Al Hunt labeled three conservatives</a>
from the South as representing "hate," a "hatemonger," and an
"extremist," but he doesn't have such a mean-spirited
attitude toward all Southerners. He thinks one should get
the Nobel Prize.

<a name=moderate>
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1)</FONT> In an amazing break out of balance, Monday night
both ABC's World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News ran
post-debate "fact check" stories that took on assertions
made in Sunday night's debate by both Dole and Clinton.
<p>
In post-debate banter, Bob Dole largely avoided condemnations
for being too negative or too harsh, but there were some exceptions:
<p>
-- On Monday's Today (October 7) NBC's Lisa Myers raised
the "harsh" theme. Here's the quote caught by MRC analyst
Geoffrey Dickens: 
<blockquote>"I think he was strongest when he talked about his
proposals, tax cuts, opportunity scholarships for poor
children. He showed the wit and humor that those of us who
have covered Bob Dole know. The problem, I think, is that he
may have been a little bit harsh at times and that I don't
think that he really did enough to bring home a lot of
undecided voters."</blockquote>
-- During a special midnight (ET) Inside Politics after
the debate CNN brought on Jack Kemp and Al Gore. CNN's
Bernard Shaw did not ask Kemp negative questions about Bill
Clinton's performance, but Judy Woodruff did pose two such
questions to Al Gore about Bob Dole. As transcribed by MRC 
analyst Clay Waters, here are two of her inquiries:<blockquote>
<EM>Woodruff:</EM> "Bob Dole, as I mentioned a moment ago, among
other things, repeatedly again referred to the President as
being liberal. I mean, just, it seemed to come up throughout
the debate. Do you think the President was able to adequately
respond to what has apparently become a negative label?"<br>
<EM>Al Gore responded:</EM> "I think the American people want to
hear about ideas and don't want to hear candidates insulting
each other and hurling accusations and personal charges."<br>
<EM>To which Woodruff asked:</EM>"Well, do you think Bob Dole
was too negative tonight?"</blockquote>
-- Minutes after the debated ended, reporter Phil Jones
made it clear he was not satisfied with Dole's performance.
MRC analyst Steve Kaminski took down his reaction:
<blockquote>
    "I think that if I had to say probably where he was the
weakest and where he really needed to score was, he needed
to explain to the American people how this country can
afford that 15 percent tax cut, the centerpiece of his
campaign, without these draconian cuts. I don't think he has
done that yet."</blockquote>

<a name=hunt>
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2)</FONT> In Sunday's CyberAlert I reported how on Saturday's
CNN Capital Gang Al Hunt, Executive Washington Editor of the
Wall Street Journal, had disparaged three conservatives. He
said Jesse Helms represented "hate," Pat Robertson was a
"hatemonger" and Woody Jenkins was an "extremist."
<p>
MRC analyst Clay Waters reminded me of what Hunt uttered
the week before, on the September 28 Capital Gang:
<blockquote>
"Whatever you thought of Jimmy Carter as President, he
has been a great ex-President, helping to avoid bloodshed
from North Korea to Haiti, bringing health care to children
in Africa and Latin America. Even Bob Novak has lauded some
of these efforts. The outrage? The Nobel Peace prize for
years has given President Carter the back of its hand. It
can make amends next week and give him what he deserves: the
1996 Nobel Peace Prize."</blockquote>
<a name=times>
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3)</FONT> Sunday's CyberAlert also reported how <EM>The
Washington Times</EM> and <EM>Washington Post</EM> led page one with the
news that an aide to Craig Livingstone contradicted his
story on the FBI files. On Sunday, <EM>The New York Times</EM>
finally got around to reporting the revelation, but on the
bottom of page A30 under this vague headline: "New Testimony
Given on Republicans' Files."<p>
But at least <EM>The New York Times</EM> reported the news. I'm
still waiting to see the first broadcast network story.

<title>As Yeltsin's Health Fades, the Succession Struggle Intensifies in Russia -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h3>
AS YELTSIN'S HEALTH FADES, THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE INTENSIFIES IN RUSSIA</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a>, Ph.D.</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 122<br>
October 7, 1996<br>
</center><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Russian President Boris Yeltsin's declining health has generated great speculation around the world about whether he can continue to lead Russia effectively. As the world awaits Yeltsin's scheduled open heart surgery, concerns for the future of Russia's fledgling democracy mount. Should he die, it is unclear who would succeed him to lead Russia into the next millennium. In addition, any further deterioration of Russia's economic stability and military position would present serious foreign policy challenges to the United States and the rest of the world.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A fascinating power struggle already is underway in Moscow involving Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin; Yeltsin's security aide and National Security Council Secretary, retired General Alexander Lebed; Chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais; and other key political figures. As this power struggle unfolds, three possible scenarios have emerged.
<blockquote> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Scenario #1: President Yeltsin dies in office.</b> Prime Minister Chernomyrdin becomes Acting President, and presidential elections, with Chernomyrdin and Lebed as the foremost contenders, take place within three months. Under Chernomyrdin, the Russian government most likely would follow the policies put in place under Yeltsin. If Lebed were elected President, Russia might assume a more anti-Western, isolationist posture.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Scenario #2: President Yeltsin rebounds and fully assumes power.</b> Chernomyrdin and Chubais remain important players, and Lebed is put under even tighter control -- perhaps even fired -- for behavior seen as disloyal to Yeltsin. In this case, Russian foreign policy would remain the same. Friction with the West on NATO expansion eventually might be resolved, but arms control and nuclear proliferation concerns would continue to mar bilateral U.S.-Russia relations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Scenario #3: President Yeltsin remains in power but is incapacitated.</b> Chernomyrdin and Chubais assume crucial roles in governing the country. Political turmoil in Moscow would force Russia's leaders to concentrate on the power struggle, and foreign policy would be neglected. Foreign Minister Evgenii Primakov might assume a dominant role in managing Russia's international affairs.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

U.S. foreign policy makers have a great deal at stake in any scenario for Russia's post-Yeltsin transition. Potential turmoil in Russia raises serious questions such as control of the Russian nuclear arsenal, civil unrest, and upheaval in the defeated, demoralized, and underpaid Russian military. No matter which scenario unfolds, any future Russian government could be less experienced and less predictable than the current one, and might pursue an adventurous policy of aggression in Russia's "near abroad" to solidify support at home. Like the czars and commissars who ruled before them, whoever gains ultimate control of the Kremlin -- whether it is Yeltsin, Lebed, or Chernomyrdin -- will have a tremendous ability to shape the very nature of Russian society and the Russian state.

<p>
<b>JOCKEYING FOR POWER: POLITICAL PLAYERS IN THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Two main contenders for the presidential mantle have emerged over the past three months. The most obvious is Victor Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's Prime Minister since December 1992. Chernomyrdin's primary opponent is General (Ret.) Alexander Lebed, Yeltsin's national security aide.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
<b>The Predictable Chernomyrdin </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to the Russian constitution,<sup>2</sup> should Yeltsin die in office or become unable to perform his duties, the Prime Minister becomes Acting President for no longer than three months until new elections take place. Chernomyrdin represents the class of Soviet-era managers who weathered the country's turbulent transition to the rough-and-tumble market of the post-Soviet era. He also represents the powerful and rich oil and gas industry of Russia, which controls hydrocarbon reserves comparable to those of Saudi Arabia. A gas industry manager during the Soviet era, Chernomyrdin served as gas industry minister in Mikhail Gorbachev's cabinet. Today he leads the centrist, pro-establishment Our Home Is Russia political movement, which won 10 percent of the popular vote in the Duma elections of December 1995.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Chernomyrdin is a convert to the gospel of market economics and a frequent dinner partner of International Monetary Fund Chairman Michel Camdessus, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, and other Western political and business leaders. Although lacking charisma, Chernomyrdin is a tested political leader who preaches the virtues of hard work and a businesslike approach to solving problems. He has proven himself loyal to Yeltsin and expects to be rewarded with the status of heir apparent.
<p>

<b>The Unpredictable Lebed</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Chernomyrdin's main challenger is a retired two-star paratrooper, General Alexander Lebed. A dark horse candidate in the presidential elections of 1996, Lebed is a charismatic and controversial politician. Before the 1996 elections, the Yeltsin camp gave Lebed generous financing, access to state-controlled television, and a team of savvy and sophisticated image makers and campaign managers. Lebed received 15 percent of the popular vote in the first round of the elections, which served Yeltsin well by siphoning nationalist votes away from the Communist candidate, Gennady Zyuganov. Lebed was rewarded with the highly visible post of Secretary of the Security Council and national security aide to the President.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since assuming his duties as part of the administration, General Lebed has become known as a peacemaker in Chechnya. He achieved a truce and accord in Chechnya in the aftermath of the humiliating defeat of the Russian military in Grozny during August 1996. The mantle of peacemaker has made Lebed even more popular with the Russian voters, who oppose the war by a margin of four to one. Lebed has scored two political victories since coming to office as Yeltsin's national security chief. In June 1996, he managed to remove the unpopular Defense Minister Pavel Grachev from the "Russian Pentagon" and to purge Grachev's cronies in the Ministry of Defense. He also succeeded in obtaining the nomination of widely respected three-star general Igor Rodionov for the post of Minister of Defense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, Lebed's popular support could disappear quickly. His promises to fight crime and corruption have remained largely unfulfilled. Russia's thorniest problems still await the general's customary no-nonsense, tough approach. Failure to make clear progress in fighting crime could jeopardize Lebed's chances to mount a credible challenge to Chernomyrdin and gain the support of the Russian public, media, and bureaucracy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lebed's relationships with many powerful Moscow politicians, including Chernomyrdin, Anatoly Chubais, and many nationalists, have soured significantly. Lebed repeatedly offended Yeltsin by openly questioning his ability to govern and by casting doubt on the state of his health.<sup>3</sup>  He also called unsuccessfully for the sacking of the powerful Minister of the Interior, Anatoly Kulikov, thereby making another enemy. Some military officers saw Lebed as too eager to conclude an agreement that came close to granting independence to the Chechen separatists. President Yeltsin, weary of this ambitious, outspoken, and unpredictable general, took action to keep him in check by creating a competing body, the Defense Council, which is chaired by Yeltsin and includes Chernomyrdin (as his deputy) and Chubais. In light of these conflicts, some believe General Lebed's political star "may fade without ever reaching its full luster."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On October 3, Yeltsin announced in a dramatic broadcast to the nation that he had stripped Lebed of a key position as chairman of the committee in charge of top military nominations. Infuriated, Lebed tendered his resignation, which Yeltsin refused to accept. Yeltsin is trying to deprive Lebed of real authority while at the same time keeping him in the government. The drama around Lebed is continuing. Firing the popular general could strengthen his underdog image and further increase his popularity, thereby also increasing his chances to succeed Yeltsin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lebed's post-Soviet conversion to free-market enterprise remains incomplete. While flirting with classic liberal ideology before the election, he now works in tandem with Sergei Glazyev, a moderate nationalist politician. As an economist, Glazyev advocates Keynesian-style industrial policy and highly protectionist tariffs to help local producers. Lebed appointed Glazyev as Director of the Economic Security Department at the Security Council, which he heads. Both Lebed and Glazyev predictably have become spokesmen for the ailing Russian military industrial complex, advocating the massive government infusions of cash that the state-run behemoth badly needs in order to survive. This position, which calls for heavier taxation of Russian energy exports, most likely will cause the oil and gas industry to rally behind Chernomyrdin. Should Lebed assume presidential powers, his policies could make foreign investment in the Russian energy sector less profitable. If Glazyev remains his chief economic adviser, Russia will become more protectionist and more isolated from international markets.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Sources inside the Kremlin have indicated that a broad coalition is forming to check Lebed's efforts in Moscow.<sup>5</sup>  One tactical maneuver -- removing Lebed as manager of the Chechen crisis and putting him in charge of the explosive issue of Russian relations with Ukraine and Belarus -- took place in September. Lebed already has sent tremors through corporate boardrooms in the West by advocating that the dilapidated Russian Black Sea Fleet play a role in securing shipments of oil and gas from the rich Caspian Sea fields. Russian and Western oil interests may be quite wary of the prospect of a President Lebed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite his detractors and a few setbacks in political dogfights, General Lebed is learning the rules of the political game in Moscow. With Glazyev, he has consolidated control over a nationalist movement called the Congress of Russian Communities (KRO). Lebed also is building another support group of hard-line veterans and military retirees called Motherland and Honor. Another political organization supporting Lebed is called Truth and Order. Lebed is interested in forcing presidential elections before Yeltsin's term in office expires in 2000. Yeltsin's failing health may provide him with that opportunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite his rows with the major Moscow politicians, Lebed remains popular with Russian voters.<sup>6</sup>  In fact, he is the most trusted politician in Russia. A recent poll indicates that 34 percent of Russians trust Lebed, compared with Zyuganov (15 percent), Yeltsin (12 percent), and Chernomyrdin (9 percent).<sup>7</sup>  If the presidential elections were held today, Lebed would have a good chance of winning.
<p>

<b>The Dark Horse: Mayor Luzhkov </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another possible presidential contender if Yeltsin dies is Moscow Mayor Yurii Luzhkov. Moscow is undergoing a true renaissance under Luzhkov's leadership. The city leads the rest of Russia in market transformation and is in the midst of an unprecedented construction and real estate boom. Moscow's banks now control 80 percent of Russia's finances. Luzhkov has even repaired the notoriously bad Russian roads and has initiated such high-visibility multimillion-dollar projects as the reconstruction of the Church of Christ the Savior, which was blown up by Communists in the 1930s. The mayor, reelected in 1996 with an unprecedented endorsement of 89 percent of Muscovites, enjoys country-wide popularity. His reputation as a tough, no-nonsense manager and <I>khoziain</I> (boss) make him a serious contender for the presidential mantle.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1993, Luzhkov initiated a campaign to arrest and deport dark-skinned "persons of Caucasian nationality" from Moscow; tens of thousands of Southerners, many of them Russian citizens, were deported without due process of law. This undertaking, while popular in Moscow, was criticized vigorously by the human rights community. The prospect of Luzhkov's becoming President should raise eyebrows among Russia's 20 million Moslems. Moreover, a campaign by international human rights organizations would taint his image throughout the world.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Luzhkov is trying to build a nationwide image as a "can-do" politician, actively reaching out to governors and regional politicians; an ally, Vladimir Yakovlev, is now mayor of St. Petersburg. Support from such political leaders may be crucial. Luzhkov remains outspoken on a variety of issues, usually taking a nationalist stance. For example, he supports Russian control of the Black Sea port of Sevastopol and adamantly opposes returning the four Kuril Islands, captured by Russia in World War II, to Japan. Luzhkov celebrated his 60th birthday with unprecedented pomp, possibly to send a signal that he is healthy and ready to compete for national office.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like Chernomyrdin, Luzhkov is capable of generating the large amounts of cash needed for a presidential campaign. His close ties to Vladimir Gusinsky's banking and media empire, for example, give him an obvious advantage. Nevertheless, his chances of winning the Russian presidency could be reduced significantly if the corruption that is rampant in his administration were to become a major issue in the campaign. Moreover, the envy and animosity of people in the provinces toward "rich" Muscovites could hinder Luzhkov's chances to win national office. The Russian provincial electorate in the end may refuse to vote for a capital city mayor.

<p>

<b>The Capable Anatoly Chubais</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais, Russia's most capable political manager, has not declared his presidential ambitions. He is often blamed for the many shortcomings in Russia's economic reforms and privatization program because he was one of the chief architects of market reforms and has played a key role in privatization efforts. Ironically, the hardship caused by these reforms is the main reason Chubais is not running at this time.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chubais is engaged in a low-key rivalry with Chernomyrdin, a conflict over Chubais's placement of supporters in key jobs with access to Boris Yeltsin. Recently, Chubais reinforced his links to Russia's Democratic Choice, the center-right party led by Yegor Gaidar, and created a political power base for an election. Chubais could align himself with Chernomyrdin against Lebed, and such a coalition doubtless would prove formidable. Chubais is not only an outstanding campaign manager, but also an impressive fund raiser, having built an alliance with the rich Russian banking sector. He also is popular in Washington and other Western capitals, a fact that could make him a key liaison to the Western political and business communities for the Chernomyrdin ticket.

<p>
<b>Other Possible Candidates </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Should Yeltsin die, the resulting round of presidential elections undoubtedly would include some familiar faces from the 1996 presidential elections. The Communists certainly will field a candidate, either Gennady Zyuganov<sup>8</sup> or his ambitious second in command, Valentin Kuptsov. Though Communist support peaked last summer, Zyuganov is unlikely to get more than 20 percent of the vote. Reformer Grigory Yavlinsky and populist nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky also may choose to run, although it is doubtful that either would gain more than single digits at the polls. In addition, there probably will be several third-tier candidates from the fringe parties and small political groups that make the Russian political landscape so colorful.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
<b>THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

President Yeltsin already has signed a decree transferring most of his power to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. As Yeltsin's operation draws closer, the possible scenarios vary according to whether Yeltsin is able to recover and reassume power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Scenario #1: Yeltsin dies.</b> Should Boris Yeltsin die in office, the Russian constitution clearly states that new elections must be held within three months. During this intervening period, the President's duties are to be performed by the Chairman of the Government (Prime Minister), who will not have the right to dissolve the State Duma.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed would be the principal beneficiary under this scenario. Chernomyrdin might want to delay the elections, fearing Lebed's popularity, but this would violate the constitution and might be politically difficult to achieve. A decree or law delaying the elections would amount to amending the constitution. Such legislation would have to be approved by the Duma with a two-thirds majority, by the Council of the Federation (the upper house) by a three-quarters majority, and by two-thirds of the regional legislatures. If Chernomyrdin were to try to pass such a law, Gennady Seleznev (the Communist Chairman of the Duma) and Yegor Stroyev (Chairman of the Council of the Federation) would find it extremely difficult to accommodate him.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In case of new elections, Chubais's role as Chief of Staff and conduit for Yeltsin's views might lessen, but his importance as a campaign manager and fund raiser would benefit him tremendously. Chubais's successful track record in managing Yeltsin's reelection as President could put him in the key position in a Chernomyrdin campaign.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the elections were to take place now, Lebed would have a realistic chance of winning. However, he also suffers from two key limitations: insufficient financing and little access to the electronic media. If Lebed maintains his alliance with Boris Berezovsky, a prominent businessman and chairman of the board of Russia's ORT-TV, he might raise enough money to buy the air time required to win. If elections are delayed, however, Chernomyrdin and Chubais could put together a coalition capable of stopping him.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If Chernomyrdin were to win, Russia probably would continue the present government's reforms. Some friction with the West would continue, but so would "business as usual."  Investment in oil and gas would receive a higher government priority, and links developed with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank under Chernomyrdin's tutelage would continue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If Lebed were to win, the future would be less predictable. Lebed has not been exposed to the West and while not vehemently opposed to NATO expansion, treats all foreigners with suspicion. His power base is the military-industrial complex, veterans of the security services and the army, and the law-and-order constituency. His staff is drawn primarily from the ranks of military veterans who were subjected to intensive anti-Western propaganda while in the service.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lebed's economic knowledge is somewhat lacking, and he relies on Sergei Glazyev's advice. This could cause a delay in the process of economic reform. Russia would likely increase its military spending and subsidize the military-industrial complex, in addition to erecting tariff barriers and creating additional hurdles to foreign investment. However, Lebed is a pragmatist above all else. If he discovered that such policies were highly unpopular, he would be perfectly willing to reverse them.	
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Scenario #2: Yeltsin recovers fully.</b> If Yeltsin survives the operation, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin will be de facto President for the duration of a recuperation period of from three to six months. This would enable the Prime Minister to consolidate his power base and patronage in preparation for the inevitable power struggle. Anatoly Chubais also would play an important role as the one who prepares the presidential decrees and controls access to Yeltsin. During Yeltsin's illness, Lebed has called repeatedly for his resignation and questioned his ability to govern. Once Yeltsin becomes strong enough, Lebed could be fired for these assertions, which many see as demonstrating a lack of loyalty.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During Yeltsin's recuperation, U.S.-Russian relations might be put on hold. Russian politicians would be preoccupied with the power struggle in the Kremlin and with domestic problems, and bureaucratic inertia and anti-Western sentiments could continue to influence Russian policy. There would be little place for bold moves to end the stalemate on such key issues as NATO expansion, ratification of START II by the Duma, or the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even if President Yeltsin recovers fully, however, his overall health, the heavy workload, and his personal lifestyle might not allow him to complete his term in office. Within a year or two, the U.S. could face a new crisis in the Kremlin and new presidential elections in Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>Scenario #3: Yeltsin is disabled.</b> This is the most difficult scenario to forecast. If Yeltsin survives but his health severely limits his capacity to function as head of state, calls for his resignation are likely to grow, with Lebed leading the choir and the Communists following closely behind. Lebed, Zyuganov, and Seleznev already have called for Yeltsin's resignation.<sup>11</sup>  This scenario would benefit Chernomyrdin and Chubais, who would be positioned to run the state as did Mrs. Woodrow Wilson when President Wilson was incapacitated in the early part of this century.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Russia's constitution does not provide for official certification of the President's health. Nor is there a tradition of making the results of presidential medical examinations public. It is not clear who, if anyone, has the right to nominate a council of medical doctors to attest to the President's fitness. While the constitution does not specify such a body, it is conceivable that the Communist-controlled Duma could show legislative initiative in this. However, the Constitutional Court would probably do its best to avoid such a difficult and highly politicized issue.<sup>12</sup>  In the past, the Court has avoided politically controversial questions, such as the constitutionality of the war in Chechnya. An incapacitated Yeltsin would continue to be the focus of political controversy. A disabled Yeltsin might trigger an even more bitter power struggle which would spill over into the Russian media. In the long term, Yeltsin probably would be forced to resign so that new elections could be held.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION: POWER STRUGGLES CLOUD RUSSIA'S FUTURE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Much is riding on Boris Yeltsin's health: the course of Russia's development as a state, Russia's security and economic relations with the world community, and the future of U.S.-Russian relations. The current crisis may take as much as six months to a year to resolve. If Yeltsin were to die, a Chernomyrdin successor government could provide for continuity in relations with the U.S. and the West, while a Lebed or Luzhkov government would take more a confrontational stance toward America. The worst-case scenario -- a victory for the Communists -- seems unlikely at this time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Yeltsin's illness is symbolic of Russia's position as a weak and ailing power. The fact that Yeltsin personally is so important is a clear indication that Russian democracy has a long road to travel. A prolonged power struggle will increase internal instability and interfere with Russia's attempts to put its house in order. Nevertheless, the fact that the transition of power may occur in an orderly manner indicates the progress of Russia's body politic. Russian democracy, as imperfect as it is, still has a good chance to survive its founder and current leader.

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Tuesday, January 21, 1997
</h3> <h2>Getting on With the Business of Governing</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Now that
the shallow rhetoric of the inauguration is history, and now that the latest Gingrich matter
has been disposed of at least for the moment, may we please get down to the business of
running this nation?<p>

There is much pious talk about everyone getting along. There are all of these platitudes
about bipartisanship. There are visions of leaders meeting at a summit to come up with grand
agreements.<p>

Now let's get real.  The fact is while everything has been at a standstill since the
elections, the national debt has continued to expand.  Not a word has been heard by any of
our leadership about tackling that one. Oh, the deficit is down. But the deficit isn't the
problem.  It is the debt that is the problem and almost no one from either party is
discussing this little item which threatens to sink us all.<p>

Then there is the matter of Social Security. Some members of the latest Commission have
actually recommended that Social Security be privatized.  The defenders of the status quo
have, of course, said no.  At least this issue is at last, after years of total silence,
being debated.  The advocates of privatization need champions in the Congress.  They have
none in this Administration. Right now there are too many voices accusing and defending
Speaker Gingrich to find out if anyone is aware that we do have a Social Security problem on
our hands which urgently needs fixing.<p>

And then there is Medicare.  The President wants a fix which will last just long enough for
him to get out of office without the "gone bankrupt" sign being nailed to the door on the
oval office.  Some Republicans are talking about block grants to the states.  Others are
talking about privatization of Medicare through Medical Savings Accounts.  There are lots of
proposals.  No real solutions at hand. And the beat goes on.<p>

The food stamp problem gets worse every year.  The Congress did not have the political will
to do something about it in the 104th.  Does anyone think that the 105th Congress has more
political will than the last gathering?  If, however, this problem isn't tackled, the
welfare reform bill which passed in the last Congress and which Bill Clinton now wants to
repeal will end up effecting very little of the welfare mess this nation has amassed.  That
bill, after all, effected just six percent of the welfare and entitlement programs which are
federally funded.<p>

I am just touching on a few things here.  I haven't tackled regulation, national defense,
the evils of multinationalism, trade and a whole host of other problems staring us in the
face.  And we have time to utter meaningless slogans such as "nothing big has ever come from
being small?"  These problems come close to overwhelming us and yet we can spend days
pondering where the money should come from to pay Speaker Gingrich's fine?<p>

The way we are governed reminds me of how certain of my kids became experts at diverting
their parent's attention from the real issues we wanted them to face.  They did this by
creating a series of side shows.  The side shows were amusing for a time.  They even
succeeded in distracting us for a while.  Sooner or later, however, we and they had to face
the music.<p>

That time has come for America.  We've had our little vacation from reality.  The
celebrations are over.  Now, will someone, anyone, please propose some solutions which will
have lasting impact on the genuine problems facing the country?  Or as my kids used to ask:
"Are we there yet?"

<title>Linda Chavez: Feminist kiss patrol is on the march -- October 2, 1996</title>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>   
<i>October 2, 1996</i><br>     
<h2>Feminist kiss patrol is on the march</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Now that everyone's had a good laugh at the North Carolina school that
punished 6-year-old Johnathan Prevette for kissing a classmate, maybe it's time to take a serious
look at just how far the federal government and the courts have gone to make this incident possible. 
<p>
In fact, elementary schools are becoming the new frontier in the fight against "sexual harassment,"
thanks to feminist groups and their allies in the Department of Education and on the federal bench. 
<p>
Since 1992, when the Supreme Court said that schools could be held legally responsible in sexual
harassment cases, some two dozen suits have been filed in federal court alleging sexual harassment
of students by other students. Although the original Supreme Court ruling involved sexual harassment
of a student by a teacher, the legal principle now has been extended by lower courts to apply to
student-on-student harassment. 
<p>
And in California, state law allows for students as young as fourth grade to be suspended or
expelled for sexual harassment. 
<p>
This year alone, at least four federal courts have ruled in favor of plaintiffs who alleged that their
fellow students sexually harassed them and that the schools were legally liable, including one case
involving fifth-grade students in Louisiana and another involving sixth-graders in New York. This
whole area of law is relatively new and adapted from employment law, which defines sexual
harassment as a form of discrimination prohibited by civil rights statutes. 
<p>
The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this year that "(a) student should have the same
protection in school that an employee has in the workplace." Most of these cases rest on the alleged
failure of schools to prevent a so-called hostile environment, which can mean almost anything from
teasing and taunting to actual physical assault. The only practical way for schools to defend
themselves is to have in place rules that punish students for unwanted verbal or physical harassment -
the kind Johnathan's school has been ridiculed for enforcing. 
<p>
But the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Education considers these matters
deadly serious and now routinely investigates charges of sexual harassment in schools around the
country. In the first year after the Supreme Court ruling, the OCR investigated more than 70 schools.
That same year, Congress appropriated several million dollars under the Women's Educational
Equity Act to provide various "gender-equity training" programs to make boys treat girls more
sensitively and ensure an "environment free from sexual harassment and abuse." 
<p>
OCR has been spurred on by advocacy groups, such as the American Association of University
Women, to zealously root out sexual harassment. In 1993, the AAUW published a study claiming
sexual harassment was rampant in U.S. schools, with 85% of girls and 76% of boys having suffered
such treatment in the previous year alone. 
<p>
Of course, the AAUW produced these shocking statistics by including everything from "sexual
looks" to actual "sexual assault" in the same nebulous category of sexual harassment. 
<p>
Johnathan Prevette may be off the hook temporarily, but not for long. If the feds and their feminist
allies have their way, every little boy and girl in the nation will be taught that flirting is a crime, and
even an admiring look, much less a kiss, can land you in court. As one lawyer for the National
Organization for Women told the Los Angeles Times recently, "The way we establish the rules and
lines of behavior is by litigation." 
<p>
Most Americans may consider this nonsense, but the courts are taking a decidedly different view.
And we can expect worse to come from activist judges in the years ahead (three of the four who
voted against school districts in sexual harassment cases this year were recent Clinton appointees).
School bussing - this time the kissing kind - may once again become the courts' top civil rights issue.

<b>ALBRIGHT BRINGS A GOOD STORY, BUT NOT GOOD IDEAS</b></a><br>Madeleine Albright is an impressive woman with a fascinating story. Born in Czechoslovakia, she was a refugee
     first from Nazism and then from communism.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/feder/fede020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/feder.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Don Feder">
<b>PRAY FOR COLOR-BLIND JUSTICE</b></a><br>You can talk about different standards of proof in criminal and civil cases.
     You can point to evidence that was barred in the first O.J. Simpson trial but admitted in the second. But
     ultimately, the verdicts were influenced by race. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/fields/fiel020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/fields.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="Suzanne Fields">
<b>DENNIS THE MENACE MEETS OEDIPUS</b></a><br>Dennis Rodman, the falling star of the Chicago Bulls, is easy to dislike
     as a man who plays to his basest nature. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/novak/nova020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/novak.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="ROBERT D. NOVAK">
<b>SENATE DEMOCRATIC HARDBALL</b></a><br>The signal last week to the Capitol Hill cognoscenti that
     Democrats were playing hardball against Sen. Fred Thompson's investigation of President Clinton's campaign
     abuses came in the return of fabled Senate wizard Michael Davidson as a back-room strategist.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/snow/snow020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/snow.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="TONY SNOW">
<b>VIRTUE IS ITS OWN REWARD</b></a><br>As a token of the New Bipartisanship, Democrats and
     Republicans have begun touting volunteerism. They both say they want to celebrate good deeds by bestowing
     grants and tax credits upon "volunteers." Evidently, salvation through compassion is out.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/thomas/thom020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/thomas.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Cal Thomas">
<b> WHAT DO BILL CLINTON, O.J. SIMPSON AND J.C. WATTS HAVE IN COMMON?</b></a><br>On Tuesday, we learned that Bill Clinton is a liberal, O.J. Simpson is a criminal and Rep. J.C. Watts, a
     black Republican from Oklahoma, is the ideological heir to Ronald Reagan. What a night! 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/toledano/tole020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/toledano.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="RALPH de TOLEDANO">
<b>R.I.P.  --  THE FBI AS THE WORLD'S GREATEST INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY</b></a><br>Time was when even liberals credited the Federal Bureau of Investigation with being the world's greatest
     investigative agency -- but how many remember?

<b>WHY BLACK HISTORY MONTH DIVIDES US</b></a><br>Many people assume by looking at me that I am a black American. However, I view myself not as black,
     or any color at all, but as a human being. As such I am subject to all the feelings, wants, needs and emotions that
     we all feel irrespective of our skin color.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/feder/fede020597.html"><img src="/thcc/images/feder.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="DON FEDER">
<b>IS BALANCING THE BUDGET IRRESPONSIBLE?</b></a><br>Memo to the president: C'mon Bill, say it. You've said every other dumb thing imaginable to defeat the
     balanced-budget amendment. So, go ahead, tell us how donning this fiscal life vest before the deck of the Titanic
     hits the water line would be ... irresponsible.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/greenberg/gree020597.html"><img src="/thcc/images/greenberg.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Paul Greenberg">
<b>A BUDGET BALANCER THAT DOESN'T BALANCE</b></a><br>How does the song go? Call me irresponsible, call me unreliable ... .
     Call me ideologically unreliable, but the constitutional amendment to balance
     the federal budget, a proposal that grows more and more popular every year in Congress, leaves me cold.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/saunders/saun020597.html"><img src="/thcc/images/saunders.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="DEBRA J. SAUNDERS">
<b>NASTY, NASTY PARTY POOPERS</b></a><br>Apparently, Democratic and Republican party leaders do not believe there is
     enough public outrage at judges who gut voter-approved initiatives that have no constitutional problems
     discernible to the naked eye. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/bowles/bowl020497.html"><img src="/thcc/images/bowles.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="LINDA BOWLES">
<b>CIGARS</b></a><br>The subject of this week's column boiled down to a choice between two hot issues: the president's State of the
     Union address and cigars. I chose cigars. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/fields/fiel020497.html"><img src="/thcc/images/fields.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Suzanne Fields">
<b>THE CREATOR IS NOT A POLITICIAN. (THANK GOD)</b></a><br>Is God a Republican or a Democrat, or what? He's hardly given us His Word on that. 

         But no matter how high the secularists built the wall between church and state, God influences public and
     private policy and behavior.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/huffington/huff020497.html"><img src="/thcc/images/huffington.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="ARIANNA HUFFINGTON">
<b>DRIVING MR. GINGRICH</b></a><br>It was a tragic day in Newt Gingrich's life when in 1993 Jim Tilton, his best friend for 30 years, died of
     pancreatic cancer.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/murchison/murc020497.html"><img src="/thcc/images/murchison.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="WILLIAM MURCHISON">
<b>WEST IS BEST</b></a><br>China proceeds with its crackdown on the liberties of Hong Kong, and I hate saying this because it's so
     politically incorrect ... Aw, I don't really, because it's true: Democracy -- the rule of the people -- does best in
     the West.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/thomas/thom020497.html"><img src="/thcc/images/thomas.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="Cal Thomas">
<b> COMPASSIONATE CAPITALISM: ONE MORE REASON TO LOVE NEW YORK </b></a><br>A group of successful, wealthy New York City businessmen and women are in a van driving to
     Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, an area often used as a backdrop for politicians who make empty promises to
     redeem the poor. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/feder/fede020397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/feder.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="DON FEDER">
<b>THE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF GAY MARRIAGE</b></a><br>A letter to Ann Landers defending sexual relations among blood relatives is yet more evidence of liberalism's
     unintended -- and most unfortunate -- consequences. Signed "A Friend of Humanity," it rips Landers for
     disapproving of a 60-year-old man and his widowed sister who get together twice weekly for activities decidedly
     contrary to Leviticus.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/novak/nova020397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/novak.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="ROBERT D. NOVAK">
<b>DEMOCRATIC FALL GUY?</b></a><br>A letter to Ann Landers defending sexual relations among blood relatives is yet more evidence of liberalism's

<b>THE STATE OF THE UNION</b></a><br>As the time approaches for another State of the Union message by President Bill Clinton, a debate is surely
     raging in the White House over whether the speech will be broadly thematic or program-specific. In the end, like
     most State of the Union speeches, it will probably be both.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/saunders/saun020397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/saunders.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="DEBRA J. SAUNDERS">
<b>REAL WELFARE REFORM</b></a><br>"As I've been saying for months, we've reformed welfare for those who don't have money or powerful
     Washington lobbyists," Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) said Tuesday. "Now it is time we did the same for those
     corporate welfare programs that aid the rich and powerful at the expense of tax paying families."
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/snow/snow020397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/snow.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="TONY SNOW">
<b>CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM</b></a><br>Here's all you need to know about campaign-finance reform: Last Tuesday evening, several
     hours after he urged both parties to "accept responsibility for (election-spending scandals) and take responsibility
     to repair it," President Clinton did neither.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/bozell/boze013197.html"><img src="/thcc/images/bozell.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="L. Brent Bozell">
<b>MUCKRAKING OR MUCKFAKING?</b></a><br>What do you call it when an undercover reporter working for a national television network, investigating the
     sanitation of a grocery store with a hidden camera, films a dirty meat slicer and then mutters obscenities when an
     employee ruins the fun and cleans it up? 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/greenberg/gree013197.html"><img src="/thcc/images/greenberg.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Paul Greenberg">
<b>FULBRIGHT FANS: THE LATEST LIST </b></a><br>The impressive $750,000 memorial, a tower of brass arising out of pool of water, will honor the former
     chairman of the once powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/huffington/huff013197.html"><img src="/thcc/images/huffington.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="ARIANNA HUFFINGTON">
<b>THE LATEST HIT ON CORPORATE WELFARE</b></a><br>What could possibly bring together the ultra-liberal Ralph Nader and the ultra-conservative Grover Norquist,
     Friends of the Earth, and Citizens for a Sound Economy? A Redskins game? A "Politically Incorrect" panel?
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/williams/will013197.html"><img src="/thcc/images/williams.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Armstrong Williams">
<b>PROMOTE THE GOOD WORK ON EBONICS, NEPHEW</b></a><br>Dear Dukelux, 

         In your last letter you informed me of a very interesting development: that the blacks are encouraging
     ignorance among their children.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>Taxing Self-Defense</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Peter J. Ferrara<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
 Even though you pay considerable taxes for police protection,
too often that protection fails, particularly in some areas of
the country that are overwhelmed by crime.  Consequently, many
citizens may feel the need to purchase a gun to protect themselves
and their families from the threat of crime.  What they probably
don't realize is how much they are <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/gunoped.html">paying in taxes again</a> when
they purchase the gun, merely for the privilege of defending themselves.
<P>
 All gun sales are subject to a 10% Federal excise tax paid directly
by the consumer.  The purchaser must also pay state and local
sales tax, averaging about 6%.  So right off the top, 15% of what
the buyer pays for a legal gun goes to the government in taxes.
<P>
 But that is just the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays for the gun, the manufacturer must pay Federal income taxes,
state income taxes, state and local property taxes, federal payroll
taxes, capital gains taxes, unemployment compensation taxes, workmen's
compensation taxes, business license taxes and fees, and utility
taxes.  For any delivery trucks, the manufacturer must pay gas
taxes, tire excise trucks, truck highway use taxes, and heavy
truck excise taxes.  On the phones in the factory, the producer
must pay telephone excise taxes.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes consume about 30% of what the manufacturer
receives for the sale of a gun.  Counting the excise and sales
taxes paid by the consumer, about 46% of what the purchaser pays
for a legal gun to protect himself and his family ends up going
to the government in taxes rather than for the gun.  So if a good
self-defense weapon costs $200 in total, about $92 of that really
goes for taxes rather than for the gun.  All of the costs of manufacturing,
delivering and selling the gun are paid out of the remaining $108.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.
<P>

<title>What Is Policy Review -- Heritage</title>

<h2><i>POLICY REVIEW: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2></center>
<p>
<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, the flagship magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, is published 6 times per year. 
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> specializes in the study of private-sector and local-government alternatives to the bureaucratic, centralized welfare state. We are dedicated to rebuilding the institutions of American citizenship -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, public and private schools, voluntary civic institutions, businesses, and local governments.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> profiles great American citizens: Houston constable Victor Trevino is reducing crime with his "zebra squad" of volunteer cops; Sister Connie Driscoll is helping young urban mothers in Chicago; <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/tolerth.html">Rev. Frank Reid</a>, of Baltimore's AME Church, is promoting black Christian manhood to the members of his community.
<p>
We study "what works": <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/glassth.html">DeVry Institute of Technology</a> sets the standard for career training; Rhode Island's privatized school lunch program tastes better and costs less; private security officers reduce crime around New York's Grand Central Station. 
<p>
We tackle tough subjects, and propose common-sense policy prescriptions, for issues such as <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thegg.html">crime</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thfost.html">taxes</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thhood.html">environment</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thfinn.html">education</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thsher.html">religion and culture</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">adoption and foster care</a>, and <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thbear.html">Social Security</a>. We publish articles by influential people on the major issues of the day. Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/tharmey.html">Dick Armey</a>, Bill Bennett, Ralph Reed, Bill Kristol, Kate O'Beirne, Grover Norquist, and other key policy makers all contribute to <i>Policy Review</i>.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> provides practical, constructive thought -- the best of conservatism-in-action.

SENATE VOTES
<P>
<a name="s1"></a>
1.  <b>BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT</b>.  Passage of the joint resolution to pass a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget by the year 2002 or two years after ratification by
the states.  Rejected 65-35, March 2, 1995.  (A two-thirds majority of those present and voting is
required to pass a constitutional amendment.)  ACU supported the amendment.  [Senate Majority
Leader Robert Dole was credited with a favorable vote on this resolution, because his NO vote
was merely a procedural maneuver designed to allow him to call for a re-vote at a later date,
should he garner one more favorable vote for the Balanced Budget Amendment.]
<P>
<a name="s2"></a>

2.  <b>PUSH-BUTTON STRIKES</b>.  Motion to invoke cloture (thus allowing the measure to be voted
on) on the Kassebaum amendment to block the implementation of a presidential executive order
barring federal contractors from permanently replacing striking workers.  The executive order had
overturned sixty years of established labor law.  Rejected 58-39, March 15, 1995.  (Three-fifths of
the total Senate, or 60 votes, is required to invoke cloture.)  ACU supported the cloture motion.
<P>
<a name="s3"></a>
3.  <b>LINE-ITEM VETO</b>.  Passage of the bill to provide the president with the ability to veto
individual line items in an appropriations bill, targeted tax breaks in a revenue bill, or new
entitlement spending.  Approved 69-29, March 23, 1995.  ACU supported the bill.
<P>
<a name="s4"></a>
4.  <b>PRODUCT LIABILITY OVERHAUL</b>.  Passage of the bill to rewrite the rules governing
product liability suits in federal and state courts, capping punitive damages against small
companies and placing new limits on such awards against larger companies, there
by reducing consumer costs and increasing product availability.  Approved 61-37, May 10, 1995. 
ACU supported the bill.
<P>
<a name="s5"></a>
5.  <b>TAX CUTS</b>.  Gramm amendment to the budget resolution to provide tax cuts similar to those
provided by the House, including a $500-per child credit, a reduction in the capital gains tax rate,
an expansion of IRAs, and the elimination of the marriage penalty in the tax code.  Rejected
31-69, May 23, 1995.  ACU supported the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s6"></a>
6.  <b>WELFARE FOR POLITICIANS</b>.  Kerry amendment to strike from the budget resolution the
provisions that eliminate the Presidential Campaign Fund that is supported by a check-off on tax
returns.  [Under current law, major party candidates for president are supported by taxpayer
funds.  The Senate GOP budget resolution would have ended that.  The Kerry amendment sought
to continue taxpayer funding of presidential campaigns.]  Approved 56-44, May 24, 1995.  ACU
opposed the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s7"></a>
7. <b>DEATH PENALTY DELAYS</B>.  Kyl amendment to prohibit federal habeas corpus appeals in state cases if a state has adequate and effective remedies to test the legality of the individual's detention.  The habeas corpus appeal is the most commonly-used legal tactic to delay the implementation of the death penalty against convicted murderers.  Rejected 38-61, June 7, 1995.  ACU supported the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s8"></a>
8. <b>FOSTER NOMINATION</B>.  NOMINATION.  Motion to invoke cloture (thus limiting debate) on the nomination of Henry Foster, Jr., to be Surgeon General.  Rejected 57-43, June 22, 1995.  (Three-fifths of the total Senate, or 60 votes, is required to invoke cloture.)  ACU opposed the cloture motion. 
<P>
<a name="s9"></a>
9.  <b>REPEALING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</b>.  Gramm amendment to prohibit money in the FY
'96 Legislative Branch appropriations from being used to award federal contracts based on the
race, color, national origin or gender of the contractor.  Rejected 36-61, July 20, 1995.  ACU
supported the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s10"></a>
10.  <b>RYAN WHITE REAUTHORIZATION</b>.  Kassebaum amendment to the Ryan White
Reauthorization bill, which would authorize new funds for AIDS research.  The Kassebaum
amendment gutted the tougher Helms amendment, which had passed earlier in the day, which
would have prevented funds from being used directly or indirectly to promote homosexuality or
intravenous drug use.  The Helms amendment defined "promotion" broadly; the Kassebaum
amendment included no such definition.  Approved 76-23, July 27, 1995.  ACU opposed the
amendment.
<P>
<a name="s11"></a>
11.  <b>MISSILE DEFENSES</b>.  Thurmond motion to table (kill) the Dorgan amendment to cut $300
million from the $671.5 million provided by the bill to fund an anti-missile defense program

motion.

non-elderly food stamp recipients to work 40 hours during each 4-week period.  Rejected 32-66,

<P>
<a name="s15"></a>
13. <b> U.N. POPULATION FUND</b>.  Helms amendment to prohibit money in the bill for the United
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), unless the president certifies that the UNFPA has terminated
all activities in China or no coercive abortions have taken place as the result of the policies of the
Chinese government.  Rejected 43-57, September 21, 1995.  ACU supported the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s16"></a>
14.  <b>STATE DEPARTMENT OVERHAUL</b>.  Leahy motion to table (kill) the Helms amendment
to require the president to submit within six months a plan to cut $3 billion over four years by
abolishing two of the three foreign affairs agencies (the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
the Agency for International Development, and the U.S. Information Agency).  Rejected 43-57,
September 21, 1995.  ACU opposed the motion.
<P>
<a name="s17"></a>
15.  <b>AMERICORPS</b>.  Mikulski amendment to provide $427 million for the Americorps program,
which pays so-called "volunteers" to engage in community service programs.  Rejected 47-52,
September 26, 1995.  ACU opposed the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s18"></a>
16.  <b>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION</b>.  Gramm motion to table (kill) the Domenici
amendment to preserve the Legal Services Corporation by providing the corporation with $340
million, a $130 million increase over the $210 million block grant program established 
by the bill to provide money to the states directly to run their own legal aid services for the poor. 
Rejected 39-60, September 29, 1995.  ACU supported the motion.
<P>
<a name="s19"></a>
17.  <b>FBI CUTS</b>.  Kohl amendment to add $80 million for social crime prevention programs and
offset the cost by cutting FBI funding by an equal amount.  Approved 49-41, September 29,
1995.  ACU opposed the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s20"></a>
18.  <b>WELFARE FOR LOBBYISTS</b>.  Craig substitute amendment to the Simpson amendment to
the Campbell amendment.  The Craig amendment would bar large organizations that receive
federal grants from spending more than $1 million of the first $17 million of their budget on
lobbying activity.  The Simpson amendment would also prohibit large nonprofit lobbying
organizations from receiving federal grants and would require all federal grant recipients other
than individuals who receive more than $25,000 to report their lobbying costs.  Approved 49-47,
November 9, 1995.  ACU supported the amendment.
<P>
<a name="s21"></a>
19.  <b>BALANCED BUDGET ACT</b>.  Passage of the bill to balance the budget over seven years, by
reducing projected spending by $894 billion and cutting taxes by $245 billion.  Approved 52-47,

<P>
<a name="s22"></a>
20. <b>LATE-TERM ABORTION BAN</b>.  Passage of the bill to impose penalties on doctors who
perform certain late-term abortions, in which the person performing the abortion partially delivers
the fetus before performing the abortion.  Approved 54-44, December 7, 1995.  ACU supported
the bill.
<P>
<a name="s23"></a>
21. <b> FLAG DESECRATION</b>.  Passage of the joint resolution to propose a constitutional
amendment to grant Congress the power to prevent the physical desecration of the U.S. flag. 
Rejected 63-36, December 12, 1995.  (A two-thirds majority of those present and voting is
required to pass a constitutional amendment.)  ACU supported the resolution.
<P>
<a name="s24"></a>

ground troops in Bosnia as part of any peace-keeping operations unless specifically appropriated
by Congress.  Rejected 22-77, December 13, 1995.  ACU supported the bill.

Analysis of 1995 ACU Ratings of Congress
</title>

<h2>
Analysis of 1995 ACU Ratings of Congress
</h2>
</center>

<P>
A NOTE ON VOTE SELECTION:
<P>

Four  categories of votes.  As the umbrella lobbying
group of the conservative movement, ACU

tracks a wide range of issues before the Congress,
ranging from taxes to abortion, from ballistic

missile defenses to term limits.  Accordingly, the
votes we choose to rate are broken down into

four general categories:  economic and budget matters;
social and cultural issues; defense and

foreign policy matters; and issues of institutional
reform.  We endeavor to analyze a roughly

equal number of votes from each category, so that
we can obtain a comprehensive picture of an

individual Member's ideological predisposition, based
on votes cast.
<P>




Votes rated on ideological distinction, NOT &quot;most
important.&quot;  Within those four broad

areas, ACU selects the votes it rates based on a
simple criterion:  does the vote reflect a clear

ideological distinction in the Congress?  Thus, the
votes we select to rate are not necessarily

those considered the &quot;most important&quot; or
the &quot;key&quot; votes of any given congressional session.
<P>

And they may not be votes we took a position or lobbied
on during floor consideration.  They are

chosen for one reason, and one reason only:  to provide
a clear picture of where individual

Members of Congress stand on an ideological scale.



<P>



Thus, for example, the 1993 vote on NAFTA was not
rated, though it clearly was one of the most

important votes of the session, in terms of legislative
impact.  The NAFTA vote was omitted

from the 1993 ratings because it was not an ideologically-driven
vote:  many conservatives voted

yes, while a significant number of conservatives
voted no.  Similarly, many liberals voted no, but

a significant number voted yes.

<P>




This simple but important criterion is helpful in
understanding any perceived differences between

a Member's ACU rating and his or her rating from
other organizations which provide ratings of

Congress, such as the AFL-CIO, the Christian Coalition,
or the Chamber of Commerce.

<P>




Vote breakdown.  For the first session of the 104th
Congress, we rated 23 votes in the House,

and 22 votes in the Senate.  In the House, two votes
were double-weighted:  final passage on

term limits, and the Balanced Budget Act.  In the
Senate, one vote was double-weighted:  the

Balanced Budget Act.





<P>
The breakdown is as follows:
<P>

<pre>
House                   

Economic/budget           	6<br>                     
Social/cultural                	7<br>              
Defense/foreign policy     	4<br>                    
Institutional Reform          	6<br>                 


Senate<P>

Economic/budget           	6<br>
Social/cultural                	8<br>
Defense/foreign policy     	2<br>
Institutional Reform          	6

</pre>
<P>
WHAT DO THE DATA SHOW?
<P>


Two types of analysis.  We did two types of analysis
on the vote data:  the first, a &quot;snapshot&quot;

look at the Congress in the first session of the
104th Congress; the second, a &quot;moving picture&quot;

look at vote trends over the last ten years.

<P>





104th Congress more conservative.  The snapshot analysis
reveals that the results of the 1994

elections, in which Republicans took control of both
House and Senate for the first time in four

decades, are reflected in the ideological vote patterns.
 Both House and Senate showed significant

increases in their &quot;conservative quotient,&quot;
as would be expected.

<P>



In the House, there were 31 perfect conservative
scores of 100; there were 9 perfect liberal scores

of 0.  Of the 73 Republican freshmen, there were
15 perfect 100s; thus, though they represent less

than one-fifth of the entire House, they accounted
for just less than half of all the perfect 100s.
<P>




The most conservative Democrat in the House was Ralph
Hall, who scored a 76.  The most

liberal Republican in the House was Connie Morella,
who scored a 25.
<P>




FYI:  Newt Gingrich scored a 100; Dick Armey scored
a 92; Tom DeLay scored an 83; John

Boehner scored an 88; Dick Gephardt scored a 12;
David Bonior scored a 12; Vic Fazio scored

an 8.
<P>



In the Senate, there were 7 perfect conservative
scores of 100; there were 11 perfect liberal scores

of 0.

<P>



The perfect conservative Senators were Kyl, Smith,
Helms, Faircloth, Gramm, Nickles, and

Inhofe.  The perfect liberal Senators were Boxer,
Inouye, Akaka, Sarbanes, Levin, Kerrey,

Lautenberg, Bingaman, Moynihan, Leahy, and Murray.

<P>




The most conservative Democrat in the Senate was
a tie between Jim Exon and Fritz Hollings,

both of whom scored a 35.  The most liberal Republican
in the Senate was Jim Jeffords, who

scored a 23.  
<P>



FYI:  Bob Dole scored an 91; Trent Lott scored a
96; Thad Cochran scored an 83; Don Nickles

scored a 100; Tom Daschle scored a 4; Wendell Ford
scored a 13; Ted Kennedy scored a 4; Chris

Dodd scored a 4.  
<P>




Congress becoming more ideologically polarized. 
The moving picture analysis, in which

voting trends over the last ten years were analyzed,
provides evidence for the conventional

wisdom that the Congress is becoming more polarized
along ideological lines.

<P>



Republicans becoming more conservative, Democrats
more liberal.  In both House and

Senate, the analysis indicates that incoming freshman
Republicans are voting more conservative

than the departing Republicans, and that incoming
freshman Democrats are voting more liberal

than the departing Democrats.  (Use charts for elaboration.)

<P>




Opposition provokes partisan and ideological unity.
 A close analysis of the 1993 and 1995

vote patterns reveals interesting party unity scores.
 In 1993, when the Democrats controlled the

White House for the first time in 12 years, long-suppressed
liberal legislation came to the floor

for votes.  Even liberal Republicans couldn't stomach
some of this legislation, and they voted

with their more conservative Republican colleagues
in opposition.  As a result, party unity scores

for Republicans were much higher than normal, with
most Republicans posting higher

conservative scores than would otherwise have been
expected.<p>






In 1995, the exact opposite occurred:  with conservative
legislation coming to the floor for the

first time in four decades, it was the Democrats
who showed greater ideological unity in

opposition, thereby resulting in most Democrats posting
higher liberal scores than would

otherwise have been expected.  Meanwhile, liberal
Republicans fractured, resulting in some

scores for liberal Republicans that were even lower
than usual.
