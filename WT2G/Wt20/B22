<h3>Who Will Be Tax Reform's "Braveheart"?</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
The need to overhaul our tax code has long been apparent, but the necessary political courage was always in short supply.  However, a historic transformation may be under way in Congress as tax overhaul now receives serious consideration.  	As portrayed in Mel Gibson's movie "Braveheart," William Wallace laid the groundwork for Robert the Bruce to gain Scotland's independence from England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.  One might say that House Majority Leader Dick Armey and House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer are vying for the role of William Wallace on the matter of tax reform, hoping that their own Robert the Bruce will be elected president in 1996 leading to independence from the many burdens of our current income tax structure.
<p><b>	Can an Income Tax Be Benign?</b>
<P>  As constituted today, the federal income tax system is a mess.  It is punitive, complicated, inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation.  Interestingly however, when initially imposed, the federal income tax appeared rather straightforward and not all that burdensome -- almost benign.  Of course, appearances can be deceiving.
<p>
<b>Original Personal Income Tax</b>  
<P>
As originally proposed, the income tax was meant to impose a very low level of tax rates on only the very highest levels of income.  The 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for an income tax eventually won approval because proponents argued that it was a way to force the so-called "robber barons" to pay taxes.  The income tax was not supposed to be a mechanism for reaching into the pockets of most Americans.
<p>
	Figures 1 and 2 illustrate this point quite clearly.  <a href="#1">Figure 1</a> shows the personal income tax structure as initially imposed in 1913, while <a href="#2">Figure 2</a> illustrates what this tax system would look like in 1994 dollars.
<p>
	Undoubtedly, the income tax was not meant to be paid by most citizens, nor were rates so high as to significantly undermine the spirit of enterprise.  For example, if the original income tax system had been left in effect and indexed for inflation, today single taxpayers would pay no tax on any earnings up to almost $45,000 and married couples on earnings up to almost $60,000.  A 1 percent tax rate would be in effect on incomes up to about $300,000.  The top rate of 7 percent would not take hold until earnings of almost $7.5 million.
<p>
<b>Original Corporate Income Tax</b>
<P>
  As for the corporate income 
tax, it was imposed in 1909 at a rate of 1 percent and a $5,000 exemption.  Again, translated into 1994 dollars, corporate income would face the 1 percent rate with an exemption of $81,967.
<p>
<b>Envy = Bad Economics</b>
<P>
  The income tax was an attempt to finance the expansion of government through an appeal to envy.  Envy, though, tends to know no boundaries, and never makes for good economic policy.  The income tax was transformed rather quickly from a light tax on very high incomes to a heavy tax on almost all levels of income.  Naturally, tax avoidance among upper-income individuals -- the ultimate targets of the income tax -- increased along with rising tax rates.
<p>
	As the U.S. undertakes a historic debate over its tax system in the coming months and years, it must be remembered at all times that the income tax remains a dangerous levy.  It raises the costs of working, saving, investing, and risk taking, thereby restraining economic growth.  
<p>
<b>A Boost to Government Spending</b>
<P>
  The income tax also acts as high-octane fuel for the growth of government spending.  Under the income-tax regime, between 1913 and 1994, inflation-adjusted federal government expenditures increased by 13,592 percent!  Over this same period, personal and corporate income taxes grew from 7 percent of total federal revenues and 0.1 percent of the economy, to more than 54 percent of total federal revenues and over 10 percent of U.S. GDP.	
<P>
<b>No Income Tax Led to High Growth</b>
<P>
  As the nineteenth century came to a close and the twentieth century dawned, the United States government imposed no income taxes on its citizens.  It was a period when America took great strides in becoming the world's most powerful economy.  Entrepreneurs pushed the economy to astounding rates of economic growth.  In fact, from 1870 to 1913 -- from when it was agreed that the Civil War income tax would end until the income tax was re-imposed -- the U.S. economy expanded by over 435 percent in real terms, or by an average rate of more than 10 percent per year -- with no inflation.	
<P>
<b>Reforms for the 21st Century</b>
<P>
  As the twentieth century comes to a close and we look toward the twenty-first century, many are concerned with America's economic vitality in an increasingly competitive world economy.  Surely, we must considerably downsize government, deregulate our economy, and re-link the dollar to gold to ensure greater price stability.
<p>
	Perhaps most important, though, we should replace our current tax system with a low, flat tax -- bringing us closer to the original intent of the income tax.  To some degree, this is Representative Armey's suggestion -- his bid, if you will, to be the William Wallace of tax reform.  In contrast, some say simply put an end to one of the twentieth century's biggest impediments to entrepreneurship and growth - the income tax -- and replace it with a direct consumption tax, such as a national retail sales tax.  This is Representative Archer's claim to being a Wallace-like tax reformer.	As long as rates are kept low, the resulting entrepreneurial boom from either plan will stagger even the most wild-eyed optimists and launch the U.S. economy into the twenty-first century.  Of course, as to who will play the role of Robert the Bruce, and actually implement a massive tax revolution, remains to be determined in November 1996.
<p>
<b>Guarding Against Losing Tax Independence</b>
<P>
  One needs to remember, though, that after William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, Scotland eventually lost its independence.  Tax reformers face a similar, ominous threat to their long-run success.  Specifically, flat tax proponents must guard against future presidents and members of Congress merely raising tax rates after most all deductions have been eliminated.  The only way to guard against such backsliding is to require a super-majority vote of the Congress in order to raise taxes.  
<p>
	Retail-sales-tax advocates, of course, must ensure that an 
income tax is not re-imposed at some point down the road.  They must repeal the 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for an income tax.	
<p>
Today, the flat tax holds the upper hand politically, and is well worth fighting to implement.  A flat tax rate of 17 percent (preferably even lower), with no taxation of capital gains, interest earned, and dividends, would boost significantly crucial incentives to work, save, invest, and take risks.  	
<p>
In the long run, however, given the destructive nature and history of the income tax, economic freedom and independence for entrepreneurs and all citizens may only be guaranteed by eliminating the income tax, to be "replaced" by government spending cuts and a low retail sales levy of less than 10 percent.  Such a "dream" tax code, though, is not yet in the cards.  Today's revolution is not quite that revolutionary.

<center><i>September 1995</i><hr>
<h3>Stay Bullish - Cut & Index the Capital Gains Tax</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
Since the Republicans seized control of Congress in the November 1994 elections, stock prices have been positively buoyant.  Indeed, between November 4, 1994 -- the Friday before election day -- to September 20, 1995, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 3807.52 to 4792.69 -- up over 25 percent.  The broader S&P 500 Index climbed from 462.28 to 586.77 -- up almost 27 percent.  The Nasdaq Composite  jumped from 766.08 to 1065.09 -- up almost 39 percent.	
<p>
One may be tempted to call this a Republican bull market.  In fact, that may be the case.  However, it is not party affiliation that matters, but the policies being pursued by those in elected (e.g., Congress and the President) and appointed (e.g., the Federal Reserve) offices.  The Republicans rode into Congress last November promising deregulation, smaller government, elimination of the budget deficit, and tax cuts.  While this combined package has no doubt influenced stock prices, maximum impact springs from the proposal to cut the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent and index capital gains for inflation.  It's basic Adam Smith economics -- higher potential profits attract investors.	
<p>
<b>Can't Afford Any Backsliding on Capital Gains.</b>  
<p>
Some faltering in the new Congress' "revolutionary" agenda can be detected.  Instead of eliminating four cabinet level departments as originally envisioned, a massive struggle is underway to eliminate just the Commerce Department.  Funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and PBS lingers.  Indeed, overall federal government spending will continue to rise.  Much-needed reform of how the federal government regulates the private sector is stalled.  Repeal of the blatantly racist and costly Davis-Bacon Act is in serious doubt.  Such shortcomings will take a toll on the economy as well as on Republican political capital.  However, an inability to cut and index the capital gains tax would be the most damaging blow to entrepreneurship, investment and the economy.	
<p>
As the old saying goes, if you want less of something, tax it.  Investors have been counting on a lower, indexed capital gains tax since late last year.  This anticipation explains a good portion of the rise in stock prices during this period.  Failure to deliver on such a pro-entrepreneur tax cut would amount to a sharp blow to capital markets.  In particular, start-up and high-growth, high-tech enterprises would feel the most pain.  In the event of a failure to cut and index the capital gains tax, potential returns on such high-risk endeavors would be reduced and, therefore, so would equity prices.  The amount of capital available for investment would be far less under a higher, non-indexed capital gains tax rate -- indeed, by various estimates, trillions of dollars less.	
<p>
<b>Main Street vs. Wall Street?</b>  
<p>
Of course, opponents paint capital gains tax reduction as a rich-vs.-poor issue, or even as "Wall Street" vs. "Main Street."  Such a confrontation is mythical.  When the successful Main Street entrepreneur with a good idea needs capital to expand and create more jobs, he seeks out investors.  To do so, he often goes to Wall Street.  A lower, indexed capital gains tax -- that is, a higher potential return on capital -- makes it far easier to attract investors.	
<p>
What hurts Wall Street, hurts Main Street, and vice versa.  And of course, what helps one also helps the other.  The best way for federal officials to help would be the complete elimination of capital gains taxes.  Short of such a sound economic policy initiative, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent and indexing for inflation will do quite nicely for now.	
<p>
<b>Again, the Importance of Retroactive Indexing.</b>  
<p>
As for indexing, its importance cannot be stressed enough.  This has been noted in previous SBSC publications.  The Senate is wavering on indexation.  The House has called only for prospective indexing (calculated from January 1, 1995) on assets held for at least three years.  To make sure that the real capital gains tax rate does not rise above 19.8 percent, that trillions of dollars are unlocked for new investment, and that resources find their way to their best uses, retroactive indexing must be passed and the three-year time limit for indexation eliminated.  	
<p>
The most pro-growth, pro-entrepreneur step this Congress could possibly muster this year is real, significant capital gains tax relief.  It also happens to be a good avenue for keeping a bull market chugging along.

<h3>First Step Toward Budget Sanity:<br> Eliminate the Commerce Department</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>

In fiscal year 1995, the U.S. federal government will spend an 
estimated $1.52 trillion.  By the year 2000, President Clinton's budget would see total outlays reach $1.91 trillion.  Even the more frugal House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution on the Budget -- Fiscal Year 1996 calls for spending to rise to $1.78 trillion by 2000.
<p>
This seemingly relentless march toward a $2-trillion federal budget 
needs to be halted.  The United States should be moving in the opposite direction -- downsizing the public sector and freeing up resources for productive, private-sector ventures.  A public-sector retreat -- making room for substantial tax cuts -- will allow the private sector and entrepreneurship to advance.  Real spending reduction means reversing course toward a $1-trillion federal government.
<p>
  Despite the cries from big-government and special-interest circles, much can be cut from the U.S. federal budget.  The Department of Energy, Department of Education, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, the Small Business Administration, bloated welfare programs, and so many other areas of federal largess offer fertile ground for savings opportunities through considerable downsizing or outright elimination.  As the first major step, perhaps no other department deserves to be dismantled more than the U.S. Department of Commerce.
<p>
<b>The Grand Delusion</b>
<P>
Supporters of the Commerce Department, most prominently Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, claim that the department serves taxpayers and the economy well by increasing U.S. exports, seeding new technologies, and boosting economic growth.  Secretary Brown recently declared: "The work of this department is essential to the economic growth and well-being of this country."1  The Secretary even asserted at the White House Conference on Small Business on June 13, 1995 that the Commerce Department leveraged a "$250 million export promotion budget into $25 billion in overseas sales."  He also declared that an end to the Department's Manufacturing Extension Project would leave "America's 380,000 small manufacturers, with nearly twelve million employees, without accessible and supportive local extension programs providing up-to-date strategies and technologies."  
<P>
Such declarations are, to say the least, most difficult to believe.  After all, if America's small manufacturers relied on a government program for "up-to-date strategies and technologies" and exporters depended on Commerce bureaucrats to sell their wares, our economy today would be a third-world basketcase.  Brown and other Commerce Department proponents fall prey to the grand delusion of industrial policy.  
<P>
In reality, government does not possess the proper knowledge and incentives to be picking industry winners and losers; nor should taxpayer dollars be placed at risk in such futile endeavors.  As for expanding U.S. exports, a productive role for the government is limited to lowering trade barriers.  The Commerce Department should not be acting as the international marketing department for certain American businesses, with taxpayers, including other businesses, footing the bill.  And in terms of boosting economic growth, the economy would be far better served if taxes were cut -- boosting incentives to work, invest, and take risks -- and the Commerce Department terminated.  In the end, individuals buying, selling, creating, and investing in the marketplace always work better than government bureaucrats pushing paper and spending taxpayer dollars.
<P>
In addition to its bankrupt industrial-policy mission, the Commerce Department also serves as a "catch all" federal department.  It houses large governmental undertakings that have absolutely nothing to do with "commerce," such as the Bureau of the Census and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
<P>
<b>Commerce Budget</b>  
<P>
The taxpayers' price tag for the Commerce Department is by no means cheap.  Federal outlays for the Commerce Department in 1995 are estimated at $3.6 billion.  Figure 1 shows Commerce Department outlays since 1980 and Clinton Administration estimates for 1995 through 2000.
<P>
<b>Dismantling the Commerce Department</b>  
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce 
offers a clear opportunity to save taxpayer dollars.  The Commerce Department should be closed, with most of its duties terminated or privatized, and the remaining moved to other departments.  
<ul>
<li> The Bureau of the Census and all other economic and statistical analysis functions at the Commerce Department, at the very least, should be moved into an independent statistical agency, along with other statistical and data-collection functions undertaken by the federal government.  
<p>
However, Jim Miller, former budget director under President Ronald Reagan, offers an intriguing alternative for the Bureau of the Census.  He notes that while the Constitution requires a population census every 10 years, it does not say a government agency has to perform it.  Why not contract it out to a private firm?2  
<p>
<li> All economic development, travel and tourism, and technology programs should be privatized if possible, or otherwise terminated, including the Economic Development Administration, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration,  Technology Administration, the National Technical Information Service, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Telecommunications and Information Agency.
<p>
<li> End the federal government's roles as international marketing department for multinational firms, and a center for raising protectionist trade barriers against foreign goods.  The International Trade Administration should be closed.
<p>
<li> Legitimate trade activities -- such as negotiating, implementing, and enforcing free-trade accords -- should be moved to the Treasury Department.  The Bureau of Export Administration, though, with its responsibility for overseeing the export of goods that could impact national security, should be moved to the Department of Defense.
<p>
<li> The Patent and Trademark Office should be shifted to the Justice Department.
<p>
<li> As for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), much of this $2-billion behemoth should be privatized, with remaining duties shifted to other departments.  For example, the largest part of the NOAA's budget goes toward the National Weather Service.  Heritage Foundation economist Joe Cobb reports that roughly 300 private companies prepare and disseminate weather forecasts, with 85 percent of the American public receiving its weather forecasts from private meteorologists and for-profit companies.  The opportunity for substantial privatization is at hand.
</ul><P>
<p>
<b>A Revolution Needs Real Commitment.</b>  
<p>
The Republican Congress is sending out mixed signals on the Commerce Department.  Some only want to cut the Commerce budget, but leave the department in tact.  Others want to replace the Commerce Department with another, smaller cabinet-level agency, such as a Department of International Trade.  These half-measures should be abandoned.  
<p>
If our federal elected officials are serious about downsizing government, then the Commerce Department truly must be eliminated.  An inability to make the easy cuts -- like eliminating Commerce -- would bode ill for the more politically difficult, but clearly necessary cuts down the road.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey issued a statement on July 26 declaring their "firm commitment to incorporate the [Commerce Department] dismantling legislation into the reconciliation bill."3  
<p>
This commitment to eliminate Commerce needs to be unequivocal if we are ever to bring some sanity back to the U.S. federal budget.  Otherwise, failure to kill the Department of Commerce would signal severe weakness and perhaps the end of a shortlived revolution.  <P><hr>

<h3>Clinton's Budding Trade War or Pacific Rim Free Trade?</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
"The consumer is king."  This concept underlies the free enterprise system. While entrepreneurs drive the economy with their new ideas, innovations, products and services, they ultimately must submit their wares to the tests of the marketplace.  The entrepreneur must meet current consumer demands, create new demands, or fail trying.   	<p>
Of course, the consumer reaps enormous benefits.  Competition among producers lowers prices, expands choices, and enhances quality.  International suppliers of goods and services are a major factor in this process, providing greater competition.  This fact probably never has been so clearly illustrated than in the automobile industry.  In essence, the U.S. automobile industry was saved by foreign competition.  As cost and quality suffered in the 1970s and early 1980s, American consumers could look elsewhere for their transportation needs -- foreign automobile companies.  Naturally, U.S. consumers would have reaped even greater rewards had the government not imposed various trade barriers.  However, even somewhat limited competition forced American automobile producers to improve their products -- to meet the needs of the consumer.	Unfortunately, President Bill Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Cantor seem ready to overthrow the  consumer as king, replacing him with managed-trade bureaucrats.  The looming threat of 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury car imports makes no economic sense.	<p>

Most absurd, the Clinton Administration wants the Japanese government to essentially guarantee market share for U.S. auto parts firms.  Imagine the fury in this nation, if the Japanese pressured the U.S. government to force private businesses to buy a certain amount of Japanese products.  To complete this strange scenario, the proposed 100 percent tariff on 13 Japanese luxury cars would be retroactive to May 20.  Retroactive taxes seem to be a favorite of this Administration -- the 1993 income tax hike was retroactive as well.<p>

A Tax Increase With All the Accompanying Evils.  One needs to remember that a tariff is a tax.  Consumers of Japanese luxury automobiles will face a 100 percent tax on their purchases, if President Clinton carries through with his tariff threat.  The end result of such an act would be to eliminate such vehicles from the U.S. marketplace -- limiting competition and consumer choices.	<p>

The Administration once again is playing the class warfare card, as it did with its 1993 tax increase.  After all, some people say so what if some wealthy individuals will have to either pay a exorbitant tax or consider purchasing a non-Japanese luxury car.  Of course, we all have heard such faulty reasoning before -- such as with the 1990 federal budget deal, which included a luxury tax on yachts.  Of course, the rich were not soaked, but the businesses and the employees who built the boats were devastated.  If the Clinton tax increase on Japanese luxury cars goes into effect on June 28, the hardest impact will be felt by U.S. importers, car dealers, and their employees.	<p>

Indeed, tens of thousands of jobs would be placed in jeopardy.  As 
reported by The Washington Times, 8,000 Americans work in Lexus dealerships and 10,000 in Acura dealerships.  In addition to Lexus and Acura models, Mitsubishi, Mazda, and Infiniti models would fall prey to Clinton's tariffs.  If implemented, these tariffs would be a clear instance where higher taxes closed businesses and placed individuals on the unemployment lines.  The Japanese import car industry asserts that as many as 81,000 jobs would be placed at risk.	An even wider threat looms for the U.S. economy, i.e., Japanese retaliation against U.S. exports.  Japan is the United States' second largest trading partner.  As we all supposedly learned from the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, protectionism hurts everyone in the end.<p>

<b>A Matter of Opening or Serving the Japanese Market?</b><P>
  While most Americans assume that the Japanese market is shut as tight as a clam -- especially in the area of automobiles -- this issue actually remains open to question.  For example, the U.S. may have a point regarding restrictions pertaining to access to Japanese car dealerships.  However, U.S. automakers have never been aggressive in establishing their own dealer networks in Japan.<P>

	More important is the question of supplying autos the Japanese want to drive.  As noted earlier, in order to succeed, a business must meet current or create new consumer demands.  U.S. critics of Japanese trade policies often resort to market share arguments.  That is, since U.S. automakers have captured such small market share in Japan (about 1.6 percent of the new-car market and 1.4 percent of the auto-parts market, according to Investor's Business Daily, June 16, 1995), severe trade barriers must exist.  However, other forces are clearly at work.

<P>For example, the Japanese drive on the left side of the road, 
as a result Japanese consumers are partial (obviously) to right-hand-drive vehicles.  The Economist reported in its June 17, 1995 issue that only two American car models -- in a total of three versions -- come with right-hand drive in Japan.  Meanwhile, the number of models of left-hand-drive Japanese cars in America equals 68, available in a total of 179 different versions.  One easily could conclude that U.S. automakers need to work much harder to meet the demands of Japanese consumers.<p>

<b>"Drop Your Gun, or I'll Shoot!"</b><P>

  Even if we assume that trade barriers remain the largest obstacle to U.S. autos and auto parts in Japan, why punish U.S. consumers?  Whenever a politician threatens to impose retaliatory tariffs on imports, I am reminded of those movie scenes where a character grabs an innocent bystander during a gunfight, puts a gun to that person's head, and yells to his opponent, "Drop your gun, or I'll shoot!"	 <p>

During trade wars, the innocent bystanders with economic guns pointed at their heads are consumers.  Just because the Japanese government may be treating their consumers rather shabbily is no excuse for the U.S. government to treat its consumers the same way.  The U.S. already imposes myriad tariffs and quotas that cost consumers billions of dollars annually.  Indeed, the U.S. is not exactly friendly to many Japanese auto imports, imposing quotas and a 25-percent tariff on imported trucks.  Rather than increasing such penalties, the U.S. should be lowering barriers to trade.<P>

<b>Free Trade on the Pacific Rim</b><P>
  Trade seemed to be the one area of the economy where President Clinton showed some leadership and economic understanding.  Though not perfect, NAFTA and GATT were major steps in the right direction.  Rather than issuing threats, raising trade barriers, circumventing the World Trade Organization (which Clinton helped establish to settle trade disputes), and perhaps creeping toward a full-scale trade war, President Clinton should reassert his leadership on the world scene as an advocate of free trade, and push for a Pacific Rim free trade agreement.  	<P>

The President certainly has struggled on the foreign policy front, including such hotbeds as Somalia, Bosnia and Chechnya.  Not to mention that after pushing for NAFTA, his administration helped to devastate Mexico's economy by assisting the Mexican government with its wrongheaded peso devaluation and bungled policies thereafter.  The President may believe that there are political points to be scored by taking on Japan.  <P>

However, any benefits will be shortlived since his actions are so transparent.  Indeed, The New York Times observed on its editorial page (May 18, 1995) in reference to the President's threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars: "It seems designed more to mend the President's relations with American unions than to resolve trade differences with Japan."  <P>

Reasserting U.S. commitment to free trade -- by example rather than by threats -- would bolster the U.S. internationally.<P>

	A free trade initiative for the Pacific Rim would change the course of American-Japanese trade negotiations -- moving away from the threat of a trade war and toward a freer, growing international marketplace.  The President has mentioned support for such an initiative in the past, but now seems to be going off in a far different, economically dangerous direction.  For the sake of the economy, he needs to get back on the free-trade track, and a Pacific Rim initiative makes particular sense at this time.  	<P>

Unfortunately, if Clinton fails to move in this direction, there are 
few signals emanating from Republicans in Congress to indicate that they understand the issue much better.  Indeed, Republicans have been eerily silent in regards to the President's threats against Japan and, effectively, against U.S. consumers.  Indeed, some Republicans have voiced support.<P>

<b>Free Trade: Providing Opportunities for America's Entrepreneurs</b>
<P>
  A recent article in Investor's Business Daily noted that the Japanese were coming to the United States to study entrepreneurship.  A Pacific Rim free trade agreement would grant them first-hand experience.  Tearing down trade barriers around the Pacific would create enormous opportunities for American business and entrepreneurs; consumers would reap great rewards; and economic growth would receive a hearty boost.<P>

	U.S. consumers, as well as businesses and employees working in the U.S. import industry, should not be sacrificed to misguided, politically driven trade policies.  Free trade works best, and the U.S. should reclaim global leadership on this issue.

<title>Capital Gains and the U.S. Senate</title>

May 1995<p>
 
<center>
<h2>Capital Gains and the U.S. Senate</h2>
by Raymond J. Keating 
Chief Economist 
Small Business Survival Committee
</center><p>
<hr>
 
<i>"Upward mobility is what America is all about, and the ability to access and accumulate capital -- an ability undermined by the capital gainst tax -- is the stairway by which people move up."</i><p>
<p>
--Jack Kemp, The Washington Time, 5/2/95<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>"Experience indicates that lower capital gains taxes have a positive impace on federal revenues.  The most 
impressive evidence involves the period from 1978 to 1985.  During those years the marginal federal tax 
rate on capital gains was cut from almost 50 percent to 20 percent -- but total individual capital gains tax 
receipts increased from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion."</i><p>
<p>
--American Council for Capital Formation, January 1995<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	In 1989, then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-ME) single-handedly killed a capital gains tax cut.  Mitchell's dedication to class warfare and blind-eye towards the benefits for all capital -- income levels from capital gains tax reduction cost the economy untold growth and opportunity -- businesses that were never created or expanded, new jobs never added to the economy, and products and services never made available to consumers.<p>

	President George Bush refused to make another serious push for capital gains tax reduction.  
Indeed, he sacrificed his no-new-taxes pledge and ultimately his presidency the following year by signing 
on to a deficit reduction package that raised taxes, failed to actually cut spending, and didn't reduce the 
deficit.<p>

	Today we have a new Congress looking to do buisness in a new way.  the House of 
Representatives has passed a tax cut package -- including capital gains tax rate reduction (top rate of 19.8 percent for individuals and 25 percent for corporations) and indexing gains for inflation.  Indexing capital gains and reducing the capital gains tax rate was by far the most pro-growth plank in the House 
Republicans' "Contract with America."  For the small buisness, entrepreneurial sector of the economy, 
capital gains tax reduction means greater access to capital for investment and growth.  If America truly has a new Senate in 1995, then the mistakes of 1989 will not be repeated and capital gains tax reduction will be enacted.<p>

<b>Tax Cuts for Growth and Spending Cuts for Deficit Reduction</b> However, some Senators seem to be unable to grasp the concept that cutting taxes and reducing the deficit can be achieved simultaneously.  Many claim such actions to be contradictory.  They are not.  The supply-side economics concept of "policy levers" can help to make this clearer.<p>

	Briefly, the policy lever concept states that policies should directed at the area of the economy where they hold a comparative advantage.  For example, the lone goal of monetary policy, or the monetary lever, should be to achieve price stability.  Meanwhile, the fiscal lever should be geared toward promoting economic growth by enhancing incentives for working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.  Misunderstanding how the economy works, old-line Keynesian economists claim that such actions are contradictory.  Yet, tight money and tax cuts in the 1980s cured stagflation and placed the U.S. economy on a robust growth path.<p>
 
	Likewise, the concept of policy levers can help us with the current dilemma regarding tax cuts and the deficit.  As noted, the fiscal lever should be positioned to promote growth.  Therefore, reducing capital gains tax rates and indexing returns for inflation makes sense -- i.e., the tax lever should be moved in a pro-growth direction.  Meanwhile, the spending lever should then be adjusted so as to deal with the deficit.  Quite simply, if the fiscal lever is going to promote economic growth, then taxes must be cut and deficits dealt with through spending cuts.<p>
 
	Tax increases only work to slow economic growth, thereby boosting government spending, 
shrinking the tax base, and actually expanding the deficit.  Meanwhile, pro-growth tax cuts along with 
spending restraint amount to the most sensible fiscal policy -- the combination of a growing economy, an expanding tax base, and prudent spending policies will shrink the deficit.<p>
 
	Tax cuts and deficit reduction do not have to be mutually exclusive.  The formula for sound fiscal policy is clear: tax cuts for economic growth and spending cuts for deficit reduction.<p>
 
<b>Boosting Entrepreneurship.</b>  Make no mistake, shifting tax policy into a growth mode through capital gains tax rate reduction and indexing, while reducing government spending, will serve to boost the small business, entrepreneurial sector of the economy -- where job creation occurs.  Indeed, considering that access to capital remains probably the biggest obstacle for small business and entrepreneurs, it is difficult to think of a more damaging levy to small business than the capital gains tax.  Entrepreneurs need capital to start up new businesses, to expand existing enterprises, and to create jobs.</p>
 
	<i>In effect, capital gains tax reduction is the best "jobs program" government can institute.</i>
 
	If the Senate wants to ensure that entrepreneurs gain access to capital, then it will:  
 
<ul>

<li>Reduce the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent on individuals, as the House did (the 
corporate rate on capital gains would drop to 25 percent); 

<li>Index gains for inflation.  Unfortunately, the House tax cut only allows for indexing from the 
beginning of 1995, no matter when the asset was acquired.  The Senate should provide for full indexing for inflation from the time the asset actually was acquired, and insist on this in joint conference with the 
House.  Full indexing would unlock trillions of dollars of capital for investment in new and expanding 
businesses.
</ul>
<p>
	In the end, however, Congress should shift the fiscal policy lever into full growth mode by 
eliminating capital gains taxes altogether.<p>

<title>Stop Government Hostile Takeovers of Family Businesses</title>

<h2>Stop Government Hostile Takeovers of</h2>
<h2>Family Businesses: Repeal the Estate Tax</h2>
</center>

<hr>
<i>"Interestingly, for a tax that is supposed to inflict such little pain, people have devoted a great deal of ingenuit to getting around [the estate tax]."</i><p>

-- Economist Bruce Bartlett in his book  Reaganomics<p>


<i>"The U.S. is virtually the only country in the world that imposes significant income and death taxes on the worldwide income and assets of every citizen, even if the citizen is domiciled elsewhere."</i><p>

--Robert Lenzner and Phillippe Mao, "The New Refugees," Forbes 11/221/94<p>


<i>"It's basically cheaper to give away a business than to die owning it."</i><p>

--Frank Rainaldi quoted Investor's Buisness Daily, 4/12/95<p>
<hr>

	At various points in the history of modern-day capitalism, concerns have been raised regarding hostile takeovers of business entities.  Worries over general corporate instability, excessive debt, and job losses often arise when an individual or firm attempts seize the reins of a corporation against the wishes of current management.  In fact, though, hostile takeovers remain a source of dynamism in a free enterprise system -- often removing moribund, inefficient management, finding ways to add value and increase production, and boosting the economy.<p>

	<i>One kind of hostile takeover distinctly anti-free enterprise, though, and worthy of harsh criticism is the federal estate tax, along with the gift and generation-skipping taxes.</i>  After working hard, paying taxes, and establishing a business over a lifetime, thegovernment moves in to claim up to 60 percent of an individual's assets upon death -- a hostile takeover, if you will.  And a target for government raiders under the guise of the estate tax are family businesses.<p>

<b>Insurance to Pay Taxes.</b>  To fend off such government takeovers, family business owners channel large amounts of resources into relatively unproductive endeavors in order to pass business on to the next generation.  Legions of accountants explore creative ways to shield assets from death taxes.  Indeed, individuals may purchase life insurance for the sole purpose of paying estate taxes. Insurance is not cheap, however, and remains out of reach for many individuals working hard to keep their businesses afloat, or if purchased, diverts resources away from productive investment.  A clear indication of a tax system gone awry is when insurance is being bought to cover the costs of taxation.<p>

<b>Killing Businesses.</b>  Most often, the need to pay estate taxes winds up killing family-owned businesses.  In fact, 60 percent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second generation, and 90 percent do not make it to the third generation.<a href="#foot1">1</a>  Estate taxes in play a significant role in this development.  Perhaps most detrimental is the fact that the government is stripping a company of much-needed capital at the worst possible juncture -- under a change of ownership and oversight. Most businesses simply never recover.<p>

	Heavy estate taxation also acts as a disincentive for investment and entrepreneurship, just as onerous income and capital gains taxes do.  With 55 percent of a business enterprise essentially slated for a government takeover, there remains little incentive for individuals to continue to invest and expand a family business when the owner reaches a certain age.  Rather, business owners possess every incentive to sell their family businesses before death to spare their heirs the costs and burdens of a hostile government takeover via estate taxes.<p>

<b>Tax Rates.</b>  Federal estate tax rates range effectively from 37 percent up to 55 percent, plus an additional 5 percent on very large estates.  <i>It is important to understand the fact that this is not 55 percent of income, it is 55 percent of all assets in an estate.</i>  The first $600,000 is exempt from taxation.  (The Contract with America proposal, which recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives, increases the estate tax exemption to $750,000.)<p>

	The gift tax is levied at the same rates as the estate tax, excluding $10,000 per recipient annually.  In addition, a generation-skipping tax is imposed on gifts and bequests to grandchildren.  The generation-skipping tax is levied at an additional, flat rate of 55 percent on amounts in excess of $1 million.<p>

<b>Tax Revenues.</b>  As is always the case when government pushes tax rates too high, tax revenues are relatively insignificant.  As already noted, high estate tax rates intensify tax avoidance efforts and create disincentives for investment, saving, and entrepreneurship.  <i>In 1994, estate and gift taxes accounted for a mere 1.2 percent of total federal government receipts, or $15.2 billion.  Between 1974 and 1994, there has been virtually no inflation-adjusted increase in federal estate and gift tax revenues (only a 0.6 percent increase).</i>  In addition, a good portion of these revenues are eaten up by the federal government's compliance efforts related to estate and other death taxes -- some estimates say as much as 75 percent of estate and gift tax collections are offset by the costs of the IRS, the Treasury Department, and litigation.<a href="#foot2">2</a><p>

<b>Economic Growth and Job Creation.</b>  In the 1970s, Australia and Canada repealed their estate taxes.  While not exactly bastions of free-market economics, both these nations came to realize that estate levies were hurting investment, economic growth and job creation.

	In the most extreme cases, the U.S. tax structure has pushed many upper-income individuals to reject their citizenship, taking up official residence in less-taxing lands.  Again, estate taxes play a major part in such decisions.  <i>Forbes</i> magazine ran a cover story about such individuals entitled "The New Refugees" in its November 21, 1994 issue.  While some might say, "Good riddance to such traitors," the economics underlying the situation should be reviewed.<p>

	A simple question arises: Why does the U.S. impose such a punitive tax code to the point where productive individuals will take the dramatic step of renouncing their citizenship in order to prosper elsewhere? Though the problem of taxing productive individuals out of a country is not new one.  In the late eighteenth century, the great economist Adam Smith warned in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>:

	<blockquote>"The proprietor of stock is properly a citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country.  He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and would remove his stock to some other country where he could either carry on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease.  By removing his stock he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in the country which he left."</blockquote>

This observation takes on even greater significance considering today's worldwide competition for increasingly mobile capital -- made even more mobile through global electronic transfers of funds.<p>

	A 1993 study by the Center for the Study of Taxation estimated the economic impact of repealing estate taxes in the United States.  The study estimated that under a no-estate-tax scenario by the year 2000, GDP would be $79.2 billion higher, 228,000 more jobs would be created, and $630 billion more in savings and capital would accumulate.<p>

<b>End Government Hostile Takeovers.</b>  In the private sector, a hostile takeover often means that the owners (i.e., shareholders) of the targeted company will benefit as their shares in the firm increase in price.  Under the government's hostile takeovers of thousands of family-owned businesses each year via the estate and other death taxes, heirs are decimated as the government often lays claim to more than half the company's assets.  Resources are funneled away from productive, private-sector ventures to often-dubious, unproductive government programs.<p>

	The only justification for estate taxes is envy -- a desire to perpetuate class warfare and worn-out, failed government redistribution schemes.  But as we all know, envy is a poor foundation upon which to base a tax code.  Sound economics is preferable.  The economics of estate taxes tells us that such levies create disincentives to invest, save, and take risks; reduce economic growth and job creation; and are expensive to administer. The time has come to repeal the estate and other death taxes in the United States.  Government's hostile takeovers of family businesses and assets must come to an end.  If not, the government will continue to destroy America's free enterprise system and our great heritage of family-owned businesses.<p>

<title>The Facts About Capital Gains Tax Reduction</title>
</head>

<h2>The Facts About Capital Gains Tax Reduction</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<i>"History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy."</i><p>

-- Sydney Hoff-Hay, SBSC Board Member, in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, 1/26/95.<p>


<i>"While I fully support the elimination of the capital gains tax, the reduction and indexation ... in the Contract With America would result in lower capital costs, increased capital formation, new and higher-paying jobs, and increased investment in start-up enterprises, as well as business expansions."</i><p>

-- Richard Rahn, Ph.D., SBSC Board Member, in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, 2/22/95.<p>


<i>"As long as risk-taking is punished, growth will be smothered.... I genuinely believe we will open the 21st century without a tax on capital gains, as we opened the 20th century."</i><p>

--Jude Wanniski, economist, before the U.S. Senate, 2/15/95.<p>
<hr>

	Much-needed capital gains tax reduction has been placed on hold since then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell almost single-handedly killed it in 1989. During the 1992 campaign, thenpresidential candidate Bill Clinton mentioned the possibility of indexing capital gains for inflation. Nevertheless, President Clinton has voiced opposition to capital gains tax reduction.<p>

Finally, the House Republican "Contract With America" called for significant capital gains tax reduction -- a 50 percent capital gains exclusion from taxation, effectively dropping the top tax rate for individuals from 28 percent to 19.8 percent, and prospective indexing for inflation. At a minimum, <i>the Small Business Survival Committee supports the Houseplanfor capital gains tax reduction, but urges the complete elimination of capital gains taxes.</i><p>

Our bold stance on the capital gains front is based on the facts, which are so often left out of the capital gains tax debate:<p>

<b>Improved Incentives for Investment and Entrepreneurship.</b> Investment and entrepreneurship are the driving forces behind economic growth and job creation. The economy needs individuals who are willing to undertake the great risks of investing sweat and/or capital in new and expanding businesses -- cssentially in new ideas.<p>

	Capital gains taxes raise the costs of such enterprises -reducing potential returns, and thereby reducing risk taking, investment, and economic growth. <i>Basic economics tells us that cutting or eliminaneg the capital-gains tax will enhance incentivesfor investment and entrepreneurship.</i><p>

<b>Widespread Benefits.</b> Critics of capital gains tax reduction illustrate great ignorance when asserting that a capital gains tax cut "will only benefft the rich."<p>

	<i>First</i>, improving incentives for investment and entrepreneurship has widespread economic benefits -- greater competition, more products and services for consumers, greater economic growth, and <i>more jobs</i>. After all, employees need employers. Providing incentives for individuals to expand existing businesses or to create new enterprises is the engine of job creation.  Absurdly, critics seem to think that individuals and the economy somehow benefit from taking resources away from venture capitalists, investors, and entrepreneurs, and giving it to the government.  <i>The problem remains that while government can redistribute, and even destroy, it cannot create</i>.<p>

	Second, capital gains are spread across a wide income spectrum.  According to 1992 federal income tax returns (most recent available), 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, 73 percent of returns with capital gains were from incomes of less than $75,000, while incomes of less than $100,000 claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<p>

	Third, any discussion of which income levels derive direct benefits from capital gains tax reduction will be misleading because capital gains are included in the measurement of income.  Therefore, individuals who perhaps claim one-time or very infrequent capital gains income can be launched into a considerably higher income bracket <i>for only the year in which the capital gain is claimed</i>.  Opponents of capital gains tax cuts misleadingly claim that the rich capture the benefits of tax cuts without mentioning the facts about income measurement.<p>

	<i>Fourth</i>, even if <i>all</i> the direct benefits of capital gains tax reduction accrued to the "rich" -- which they do not -- one must ask: Who possesses better incentives to invest money more wisely, a rich person investing his own money or a government bureaucrat spending the taxpayers' money?<p>

<b>Double Taxation</b>.  Capital gains taxes represent a form of double taxation,  Individuals pay taxes on income they earn, and then choose to either save, invest, or consume their after-tax dollars.  The federal government does not tax consumption, but certainly does tax the benefits of saving and investing.  <i>Eliminating capital gains taxes, as well as taxes on interest earned from saving, alleviates the bias against saving and investment</i>.<p>

<b>Equalizing Tax Treatment of Capital Gains with Government Debt</b>.  Interest on most state and local government debt instruments are not subject to federal taxation, while capital gains are taxed.  This tax structure makes no economic sense.  Government securities present few risks for investors, while investments in private-sector equities, business expansion, and new enterprises offer considerable risks.  In addition, government debt generally finances rather unproductive government projects and programs, while capital gains are generated by successful private-sector enterprises that boost the economy, expand the tax base, and create real jobs.  <i>Clearly, capital gains income should receive the same tax treatment as interest on state and local government debt</i>.<p>

<b>Capital Gains Tax Reduction and Federal Tax Revenues</b>.  Static government analyses project revenue losses from capital gains tax reduction.  However, as the top tax rate on capital gains declined from almost 50 percent to 20 percent between 1978 and 1985, capital gains tax receipts <i>increased</i> from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion.<a href="#foot1">1</a>  In contrast, the 1986 Tax Reform Act hiked the capital gains tax rate by 40 percent -- from 20 percent to 28 percent -- but by 1992 capital gains tax revenues registered about the same amount as were collected in 1985 (far less in real terms).  Naturally, the increase in the capital gains tax rate resulted in far lower capital gains realizations.<p>

	After all, the economy is dynamic, not static.  Therefore, individuals will alter their economic behavior according to the incentives established by governmental policies.  Even the complete elimination of capital gains taxes on individuals does not mean that the federal government will lose all of the $26 billion or so it collects from this levy because investment and entrepreneurship will respond positively, spurring growth and creating revenue feedback for the federal government through other levies.<p>

<b>International Treatment of Capital Gains</b>.  Most of our top international competitors -- including Japan and Germany -- do not tax capital gains as harshly as the U.S. does.  In fact, <i>nations like Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Germany do not tax capital gains income at all</i>.<p>

	Even nations like Great Britain and Australia who tax capital gains at 40 percent and 48.3 percent, respectively -- higher rates than the U.S. -- adjust asset prices for inflation.  Once inflation is factored into the equation, the <i>real</i> U.S. capital gains tax rate jumps much higher than the stated rate of 28 percent -- often well in excess of 50 percent.  In fact, many U.S. taxpayers wind up paying taxes on <i>real</i> capital losses.<p>

	In addition, most states and some cities levy their own capital gains taxes -- pushing the total capital gains tax rate even higher.<p>

<b>Unlocking Past Gains and Improving Economic Efficiency</b>.  Literally trillions of dollars are locked into investments at present because high tax rates, especially after adjusting for inflation, create significant disincentives for investors to sell.  <i>Eliminating capital gains taxes would unlock huge amounts of capital -- that are artificially locked in because of current tax treatment of capital gains income -- to be reinvested in new and growing ventures</i>.

	When one moves past the class warfare rhetoric and nonsensical arguments against capital gains tax reduction, the economics are clear.  <i>Sharply reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes increases potential returns on investment and entrepreneurship, thereby promoting economic growth and job creation</i>.

<h2>Competition and Common Sense:</h2>
<h2>The Two Essential Ingredients for Constructive</h2>
<h2>Health Care Reform</h2>

By Raymond J. Keating
</center>
<hr>

<i>"Anyone familiar with my career in public service knows I strongly favor the social goals of relieving poverty and enhancing the quality of life for all people.  Not one American should be denied access to health care.  But in trying to collect the costs from business, we assume every employer can effectively play a national version of the street corner shell game, with the consumer paying the bill.  But consumers have choices and some businesses have real limitations on what they can charge for products or services.  When government is unmindful of these dynamics, it often means loss of employment for those we seek to help."<p>
</i>
--George McGovern, Insight, 4/26/93<p>


<i>"According to ... the CATO Institute, MSAs would lower the nation's annual health care bill by $33 billion"</i><p>

--National Center for Policy Analysis, Health Care Briefing Book<p>

<hr>

	The misguided effort by President and Mrs. Clinton to further inject government into the U.S. health care system thankfully died in 1994.  However, the underlying struture that makes health care so costly still lives on -- i.e., an expanded definition of "insurance," the prevailing use of third-party payments, and government regulations which prevent innovative methods for making health care affordable and accessible.  in addition, self-employed entrepreneurs and uninsured individuals are not given equal tax treatment in terms of their health care expenditures as is received by employer-based insurance plans.<p>

	In order to control costs, increase choices, and further enhance quality, <i>market-based</i> health care reforms are needed.  The byer-seller relationsh8ip between consumers and suppliers of health care services needs to be re-established.  Under a thrd-party system of payments, neither consumer nor provider have an incentive to be concerned about costs.  Therefore, costs naturally rise.<p>

	There are two veins to thise thrid-party payment system.  First, government involvement in the health care market has increased, especially since the inception of Medicaid and Medicare in the mid-1960s.  Second, the concept of "insurance" has been vastly expanded. By definition, insurance is supposd to cover  catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Today, health insurance plans cover small and predictable expenses.  Such a perversion of health insurance would be the equivalent of extending one's home-owners insurance to cover the costs of mowing the law, trimming and painting the house.<p>

	Make no mistakes, third-party payments have increased dramatically over the past three decades.  For example, according to economist Ed Rebenstein in his book <i>Right Data</i>, in 1950 government fianced 25.3 percent of health care expenditures, private insurance 15.8 percent, and 58.9 percentcovered out of pocket.  As of 1965, government's share had risen to 26.2 percent, private insurance rose to 28.1 percent, while out-of-pocket fiancing fell to 45.7 percent.  By 1990, government fianced health care expenditures reached 42.4 percent, private insurance hit 37.2 percent, with out-of-pocket fiancing falling to a mere 20.4 percent.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i> 1994, in 1991, government fianced expenditures equaled 43.9 percent, private insurance and other private sources 36.9 percent, and 19.2 percent out of pocket.<p>

	The effect of this usurpation of the buyer-seller relationship has been clear -- rising costs.  For example, per capita U.S. health care expenditures between 1965 and 1991 increased by 1,306 percent, versus a rise in the consumer price index of 332 percent.<p>

	The Small Business Survival Committee believes that two reform measures by the 104th Congress and the Administration would go a long way in curing what ails the health care marketplace.<p>

<b>Medical Savings Accounts.</b> Incentives need to be established so that individuals can save to cover the costs of standard, predictable health care expenses out of pocket, while also purchasing catastrophic health care insurance.  Allowing individuals to establish tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs) would provide the basis for such a system.<p>

	The most common MSA scenario would have employers and employees shifting payments from a standard health plan to a split system of an MSA and a catastrophic plan.  For example, a standard plan costing $5,000 could be replaced with $3,000 going into an employee's MSA ($2,500 from the employer and $500 from the employee) and $2,000 covering a catastrophic plan with a $3,000 deductible.<p>

	The employee withdraws funds from the MSA, penalty free, to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses.  Since the employee has an established "budget" and is able to keep what he does not use by the end of the year, the employee has an incentive to spend more prudently and comparison shop for health care purchases.  After all, <i>the critical issue in making health care more accessible is to make it more affordable.</i>  If consumers become more concerned with costs, health care providers are forced to be more cost sensitive in pricing health care services.<p>

	Also, many individuals would be able to build up a large amount of savings in their MSAs, which in turn would help offset health care costs in case the employee lost his job.  Such a plan could be designed to help the poor as well -- eventually replacing Medicaid, and its daunting bureaucracy and costs, with health care vouchers that could be deposited in MSAs.  Again, this would go a long way in helping to alleviate some of the high costs associated with third-party payers, in the case of Medicaid, the government.<p>

	In places where MSA plans already are being tried, the results have been quite positive.  For example:<p>

<ul>
<li>A recent study (January 11, 1995) by the Evergreen Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington reviewed MSA plans currently in use.  They found that the use of MSAs generated "reduced health care spending by sponsors/employers and employees; wiser use of health services by consumers; greater use of preventive services; increased consumer involvement in health care decisions and purchases; dollar savings and improved choice for healthy and ill people; MSA preference by low-income employees; [and] strong employee participation and satisfaction."

<li>Also, the Evergreen report noted that the MSA plan instituted by Forbes, Inc. has reduced insurance premiums by 27 percent since 1991.

<li>According to a survey by The Luntz Research Companies, 98 percent of the employees at Golden Rule Insurance (Indianapolis, Indiana) enrolled in the companys MSA plan are satisfied with the program.  Ninety percent of Golden Rules employees have chosen to enroll in the plan, with the average enrollee accumulating $1,002 in refunds in 1994.  About half of those receiving refunds planned to spend the money on living expenses, holiday gifts and other items, while the other half planned on keeping their money in an interest-bearing MSA reserve account or investing the money in other ways.  Total employee refunds for 1993 and 1994 amounted to $1.2 million.  In addition, for the second straight year using MSAs, Golden Rule has had no rate increase.
</ul><p>

<b>Equalized Tax Treatment of Health Care Expenditures for the Self-Employed and Uninsured.</b>  The current tax system allows full tax deductibility for employer-provided health insurance, but denies such treatment to out-of-pocket health care expenditures and self-employed individuals.  In order to ensure that individuals and entrepreneurs can afford health care, their health care expenses -- whether for insurance or out-of-pocket payments -- should be allowed full tax deductibility.<p>

	The current system of only allowing full tax deductibility for employer-provided insurance benefits larger companies and their employees, leaving entrepreneurs and uninsured workers behind.  Extending 100-percent deductibility to entrepreneurs merely levels the playing field.  In turn, full deductibility may help to foster entrepreneurship.  Many individuals are unwilling to undertake the risks of starting a new business because once they leave the security of being an employee in an established firm, they may lose health care benefits.  Allowing for 100-percent deductibility would give an added incentive for individuals to start their own businesses.<p>

	Unbelievably, Congress and the Administration even allowed the 25-percent deduction for health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed to expire last year.  As a first step, Congress should reinstate this 25-percent deduction immediately (which will still require many individuals to file amended tax returns), and then phase in the 100-percent deduction.<p>

	
	MSAs and full tax deductibility for individuals and entrepreneurs are the kind of market-oriented health care reform measures that will provide greater access to care, enhanced choice for health care consumers, while providing incentives to control costs.  Health care reform may be the arena where the degree of real change brought about by this past election will be measured.  In fact, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer (R-Tx.) is expected to introduce a bill shortly that will include MSAs.<p>

	A government-driven health care plan is one of a primary reason that the Clinton Administration is taking on water.  Market-driven health care reforms could buoy the new Congress.<p>

<h2>Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes:<br>
Lifeblood for an Entrepreneurial Economy</h2><p>
by Raymond J. Keating<p>
</center>
<hr>

<i>"[W]e have to cut the rate on capital gains, which is ... a vacuum sucking up our capital savings into the general treasury."<p></i>

-- U.S. Rep. Bill Archer.<p>
<p>

<i>"Better yet, eliminate capital-gains taxes entirely."</i><p>

-- Ed Rubenstein, Economics Analyst, National Review<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>"Investors are naturally reluctant to support new ventures in decaying urban neighborhoods where theft, drug abuse, violent crime and buisness bankruptcy rates are all very high.  This source of venture capital will not be tapped until sufficient incentives make inner-city investment more attractive to individual backers.  Conversely, reducing the tax on capital gains effectively increases the flow of fiancial 'seed corn' to budding entrepreneurs."<p>
</i>
-- Wall Street Journal op-ed, 8/25/93, by the chairman and four members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.<p>
<p>
<hr>
Most entrepreneurs seeking to start up or expand an enterprise will tell you of a major obstacle -- raising capital.  The answer to this problem is not a proliferation of governmental entities siphoning taxpayer funds to fledgling businesses.  Instead, encouragement for private-sector investment in small business needs to be enhanced.<p>

Investment and entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy.  There is no more important economic task than investing both	sweat and capital in new ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet, the risky nature of such ventures often scares off bank lending officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for entrepreneurial enterprises.<p>

In the economic world of risk-and-reward tradeoffs, the <i>opportunity</i> for high returns must be present in order to entice investment in such high-risk ventures.  Capital gains taxes significantly cut into those returns, thereby diminishing incentives to invest.<p>

The Republican majorities in both houses of the new Congress are considering a reduction in the federal capital gains tax rate, and indexing the rate for inflation.  These are crucial steps to igniting entrepreneurship and investment in the U.S. economy, and thereby stimulating economic growth and job creation.  Though, <i>in order to make the United States a capital haven and an economic-growth juggernaut, taxes on capital gains should be eliminated altogether.</i><p>

<h3>Indexation</h3>

The nominal rate of federal taxation on capital gains income is 28 percent.<a href="#foot1">1</a>   However, when inflation is factored into the capital gains equation the <i>real</i> capital gains tax rate rises substantially.<p>

For example, an individual that made a $10,000 venture capital investment in 1987, and sold it for $15,000 in 1993, would owe $1,400 in federal capital gains taxes at the 28 percent rate.  However, when factoring inflation (we use the gross domestic product deflator) into this equation, the real capital gains tax rate on this transaction jumps to 53 percent.<a href="#foot2">2</a><p>

The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on <i>real capital losses</i>.  That is, after factoring inflation into the equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor still pays taxes on the nominal gain.<p>

Depending on the Federal Reserve's success in maintaining stable prices, the real capital gains tax rate can fluctuate considerably as well.  Figure 1 offers an example of how the Fed's efforts, or lack thereof, to fight inflation can impact capital gains tax rates.  Listed are the real capital gains tax rates from 1977 through 1993 on three-year investments yielding a total nominal return of 30 percent.  It is assumed that the investment is closed out at the end of the stated year, for example, the 1985 real capital gains tax rate relates to an investment made at the beginning of 1983 and sold at the end of 1985.<p>

<hr>	These real rates of capital gaasdfbacsadfasdfsfdwerwerqwerq4ins taxation 	represent severe impediments to keeping America's economy vibrant and growing.  A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to investment, while real rates ranging from 40 percent to 494 percent to even paying taxes on a real capital loss, amount to economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains determination -- equalizing stated and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.<p>

<h3>From Cutting to Eliminating the Capital Gains Tax</h3>

	Members of the new Congress are considering a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent by providing for a 50-percent exclusion on capital gains income.   Combined with indexation, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new Congress.<p>

	However, given the critical and high-risk nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and  the importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains should be excluded from taxation altogether.  A zero percent capital gains tax rate would ensure that entrepreneurial risk taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the U.S. federal tax code.<p>

	Figure 2 offers a comparison of capital gains tax rates among various nations.  The current U.S. non-indexed capital gains tax rate is not competitive internationally.  Even the two nations -- Australia and the United Kingdom -- with higher nominal rates than the United States allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S. real capital gains tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending on U.S. inflation.<p>

<hr>

	From a capital gains perspective, these other nations offer a more conducive and dynamic environment for investment and entrepreneurship.  In a competitive, global economy, a zero percent capital gains tax rate would make the United States a magnet for capital.  Eliminating the capital gains tax would be the most pro-growth, proactive jobs program taken by the new Congress.<p>

<h3>The Growth Effects</h3>

	The potential benefits of eliminating the capital gains tax are clear.  Figure 3, for example, notes that venture capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined up to 1986; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in 1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent.  Eliminating the capital gains tax would  augment incentives to invest in new and expanding ventures.<p>

	In a report released earlier this year,<a href="#foot3">3</a> and reported on in the Small Business Survival Committee's July 1994 <i>Small Business and the Economy</i> newsletter, economists Gary and Aldona Robbins estimated the economic impact of eliminating the federal capital gains tax.  By the year 2000, the Robbins' projected that a zero percent capital gains tax rate would lead to: <p>

<ul>
<li>an additional $3.2 trillion in capital formation;
<li>the creation of 1.1 million additional jobs;
<li>an extra $1.6 trillion in GDP between 1994 and 2000, with annual GDP $391 billion higher than otherwise by the year 2000;
<li>an additional 0.43 percentage points on the long-term annual growth rate for the economy.
</ul><p>

<h3>Government Revenues</h3>

	Gary and Aldona Robbins also noted that much of the lost revenue to the federal government would be recaptured due to enhanced economic growth resulting from the elimination of the capital gains tax.  In fact, when accounting for higher state and local revenues due to a higher rate of growth, they estimate that all levels of government would <i>net</i> $25 billion annually by the year 2000.<p>

	The Robbins' "dynamic" assumptions regarding the recapturing of revenues due to enhanced economic growth are much more realistic than the "static" models normally employed by critics of capital gains tax reduction.  After all, the economy is dynamic -- in the sense that individuals respond to incentives.  People are not static economic variables.<p>

	However, even if one is forced to employ unrealistic, static assumptions regarding revenue projections, the case for eliminating the capital gains tax still stands.  The purpose for eliminating capital gains taxes is to spur investment, entrepreneurship, and economic growth and opportunity.  If that means cutting government spending more deeply than might be called for under a more realistic, dynamic assessment of revenues, so be it.<p>

<h3>Who Benefits?</h3>

	Opponents will employ class warfare tactics, and argue that a capital gains tax is merely a sop to the wealthy.  However, capital gains taxes are not levies on the wealthy, but levies on wealth creation.  As argued here, the benefits of eliminating capital gains levies will be felt throughout the economy as economic growth accelerates.  Simply speaking, you can't have job creation without capital investment and entrepreneurs.<p>

	In addition, capital gains tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe.  As noted in Figure 4, based on 1992 federal income tax returns (most recent available), 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  As Figure 5 shows, total incomes of less than $100,000, including capital gains, claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<a href="#foot4">4</a><p>

<h3>Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains</h3>

	In addition to their false assumptions about large revenue losses and the identification of capital gains just with the wealthy, opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains and, for example, wage or interest income.<p>

	In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and capital gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments, which tend to carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even interest.  In particular, investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant risk.  As already noted, high-risk ventures must at least present the opportunity for high rewards.<p>

<h3>Small Business and the Economy Will Benefit From a 0% Capital Gains Tax Rate</h3>

	Small business is the engine of economic growth and job creation.  In order to undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without adequate capital, new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a premature death.  And with such deaths also go products, services, and jobs.  By eliminating the capital gains tax, Congress and the Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and entrepreneurship -- boosting economic growth and opportunity.<p>

	History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact, during the 1980s, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share of total income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working, saving and investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs were created, and the employment ratio<a href="#head5">5</a> reached a record-high 63 percent in 1989.<p>

	The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and corporate tax rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase in the capital gains tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax hike in the form reduced venture capital investment and restrained entrepreneurship.<p>

	The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

<H2>ONLY EIGHT OF 150 WORLD ECONOMIES RATED "FREE" ON 1997 "INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM"</H2></CENTER>
<p>
	<B>WASHINGTON</B> -- If the economy of Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, keeps growing at its current rate, living standards there won't reach those currently enjoyed by the Western nations for another 102 years. But if Bangladesh frees its economy and achieves growth rates on par with those of, say, Singapore, the people of Bangladesh would be living as well as Americans do today in just 40 years.
<P>
	That's just one of the findings from the 1997 "Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> Index of Economic Freedom," a 520-page book that rates economic freedom -- or the lack of it -- in 150 of the world's 191 countries. 
<P>
	The major finding of the "Index" -- a joint publication of The Heritage Foundation, a prominent Washington-based think tank, and <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, the global business newspaper -- is clear: "Countries with the most economic freedom have higher rates of economic growth than those with less economic freedom," say co-editors <A HREF="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</A>, Heritage vice president for foreign policy studies, <A HREF="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</A>, Heritage policy analyst, and Melanie Kirkpatrick, assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page. 
<P>
	The problem is, only eight countries have economies that can be classified as "free," according to the study.  This is down from 11 last year, but up from seven in 1995, the first year the "Index" was published. All told, the 1997 "Index" shows that 78 countries have economies that are either "mostly unfree," like Bangladesh, or "repressed," like Libya and Cuba, but only 72 countries whose economies earn ratings of "mostly free" or "free." 
<P>
	The British colony of Hong Kong (which reverts to Chinese control on July 1, 1997) is credited with having the freest economy in the world, thanks to its low taxes, almost non-existent trade barriers, world-class banking system and minimal regulation. The other seven countries with "free" economies, in descending order, are Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom and Taiwan. Of the 18 countries that earned the label economically "repressed," the five worst (starting at the bottom) are North Korea, Laos, Cuba, Iraq and Vietnam.
<P>
	The "Index" scores the relative freedom of economies based on 10 factors -- trade policy, tax policy, government consumption of economic output, monetary policy, foreign investment, wage and price controls, property rights, regulation, and the size of the black market. In each category, a country's economy is assigned a score on a scale from one (best) to five (worst). 
<P>
<B>Economic Freedom Sparks Growth</B>
<P>
	Besides providing an annual snapshot of economic freedom around the world, the Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> "Index" is a powerful tool to explain why some countries (and their people) prosper, while others lag behind. In a new chapter added this year, Heritage Foundation economist <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> examines the relationship between the degree of economic freedom in a country and its rate of economic growth and finds a statistically significant correlation between the two (at the 99 percent confidence level). "Our analysis strongly suggests that countries with free-market public policies grow faster than countries that discourage economic freedoms," Beach says. 
<P>
	While this may seem obvious, Beach takes pains to stress that it is a country's degree of economic freedom -- not its population growth, access to natural resources, or pace of technological change -- that appears to determine its potential for significant economic growth. He is joined in this conclusion by many economists who espouse what is called "new growth theory," which rejects the view that long-term economic growth happens only by accelerating a country's technological change. Instead, these economists believe a country's "institutional setting" -- its economic freedom, if you will -- most strongly influences growth rates. As Mancur Olson, a leading growth-theory economist quoted by Beach, puts it: "The only ... plausible explanation is that the great differences in the wealth of nations are mainly due to differences in the quality of their institutions and economic policies."
<P>
	This has obvious implications for the world's poorer countries, which need not resign themselves to sub-par economic growth rates, Beach says. "There is no reason that Bangladesh, or other poor countries, can't achieve economic growth rates that would put their living standards on par with those of developed countries within a generation," he says. "The key is economic freedom."
<P>
<B>An Investor's Tool</B>
<P>
	In another new chapter added this year, <I>Wall Street Journal</I> Deputy Editor (International) George Melloan examines how the "Index" can be used by those engaged in "country risk analysis," a rapidly emerging field spawned by the rush of Western capital into foreign markets. Americans alone, for example, purchased $51.2 billion in foreign stocks and $46.8 billion in foreign bonds in 1995. Foreign direct investment in developing countries totaled $90 billion.
<P>
	While Melloan concedes that country risk analysis involves a lot of guesswork, he says "it goes without saying that open systems where there is a high degree of economic and political freedom are easier to assess than closed or partly closed systems."  It is here that the "Index" shows its value, pointing risk specialists toward countries whose economic freedom makes them more attractive investment opportunities. 
<P>
	For example, the countries in the upper regions of the "Index" -- such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany -- also receive straight A's from the bond-rating firm of Standard & Poors, marking them as sound investments. 
<P>
	But there are also cases where countries that score poorly on the "Index" are viewed by risk analysts as worthy investments. China is a case in point. Ranking only 125th on the "Index," China has nevertheless attracted a flood of foreign investment in recent years -- $27.5 billion in 1993, up from $4.3 billion in 1991.  Melloan says this in no way invalidates the importance of economic freedom to a country's development, but rather reflects both the attractiveness of China's sheer size and its skillful ability to capture foreign investment. Moreover, he says, China's economic resurgence almost certainly will not last unless its leaders further reduce government intervention in its economy.
<P>
	In the end, country risk analysis is "a little bit like critiquing art," Melloan says. "Most of the specialists think they know a good risk when they see it, and the more freedom of decision-making they see in any given system, the more likely they are to judge it favorably. That is why the 'Index of Economic Freedom' is a valuable tool for the investor."
<P>
<B>Foreign Aid: More Harm Than Good</B>
<P>
	If the "Index" explains what works in moving countries up the economic ladder, it also explains what doesn't: foreign aid. In fact, the data demonstrate that "instead of helping poor countries lift themselves out of poverty, development aid often impedes their economic growth," says co-author Bryan Johnson. 
<P>
	Because many long-term U.S. foreign-aid recipients have unfree or repressed economies, Johnson says, the money spent on them is useless or even harmful. Consider:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Haiti</B>, which has relied on U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, remains one of the world's poorest countries. Despite nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid, Haiti's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) fell from $360 in 1965 to $225 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Peru</B> has also received U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, nearly $2 billion worth. Yet its per capita GDP dropped from $1,307 in 1965 to $1,103 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Somalia</B> has taken nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid during the past 41 years, yet its per capita GDP declined from $123 in 1965 to $111 in 1993.
</UL>
<P>
	All told, of the 78 countries ranked as mostly unfree or repressed on the "Index," 34 have received U.S. foreign aid for more than three decades, Johnson says. Of these 34 countries, 23 are no better off today than they were in 1965; and of these 23, 13 are actually poorer today than they were in 1965.
<P>
	Johnson notes that countries graduating to the developed world in the last 20 years -- such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Chile -- have done so largely without the crutch of foreign aid. At the same time, he says, countries in sub-Saharan Africa, a region receiving large amounts of foreign aid, have remained impoverished. The difference, again, is economic freedom: The "Asian Tigers" and Chile embraced the free-market reforms necessary to spark economic growth, the African nations haven't. 
<P>
	A comparison of two countries -- Niger and Singapore -- makes the point. While the African nation has received half a billion dollars in U.S. aid during the past 37 years, its per capita wealth shrank from $617 in 1965 to $272 in 1994 -- a drop of more than 60 percent.  Singapore, by contrast, was cut off from most foreign aid by the late 1960s, yet its per capita GDP has exploded from $1,863 in 1965 to $23,360 in 1994 -- a twelvefold increase. 
<P>

<B>Regional Breakdown</B>
<P>
	Some of the key findings of the 1997 Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> "Index" concerning specific regions and countries include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B> Europe.</B> Switzerland remains the economically freest country in Europe (and fifth overall), followed by the United Kingdom (seventh), the Netherlands (ninth), and the Czech Republic, Denmark and Luxembourg (all tied for 11th). While some formerly communist countries continue to advance toward economic freedom, with the Czech Republic and Estonia (25th) leading the way, others are making little progress, including Bulgaria (108th), Russia and Albania (tied for 115th). Interestingly, Germany (20th) is the only country in Europe to receive a worse score in each successive edition of the "Index," the latest drop stemming from a failure to complete its privatization of state-owned industries.
<P>
<LI><B>Latin America.</B> Chile (22nd) has surpassed Panama (31st) as the freest economy in Latin America, due largely to progress on reducing trade barriers and eliminating price controls, Johnson says. By contrast, little progress has occurred in Mexico (94th), which continues to have a mostly unfree economy. Colombia (78th) and Venezuela (108th) both have received worse scores in each successive edition of the "Index," while Guatemala (50th), Peru (64th) and Ecuador (75th) have each recorded successively better scores. Cuba's economy remained repressed.
<P>
<LI><B>Asia.</B> Despite enthusiasm from the investment community, Vietnam (143rd) remains economically repressed, owing to corrupt border officials, inadequate foreign investment laws, and minimal protections for private property. Japan's score remained unchanged from last year, as did its status as one of the world's 11 freest economies. Overall, the countries of Asia remain a striking mix of the economically free -- Hong Kong (first), Singapore (second), Taiwan (seventh), Thailand (23rd) -- and the unfree -- North Korea and Laos (tied for 148th), Myanmar (formerly Burma, 140th), and China (125th).
<P>
<LI><B>Africa.</B> Of the 40 African countries graded, not one received a score of free, seven received scores of mostly free, 26 scored mostly unfree, and seven were repressed. Morocco was the freest (46th) while Somalia and Libya (tied for 143rd) were the most repressed. Of the 18 repressed countries worldwide, more than a third are in Africa.

<H2>FOREIGN AID CAN IMPEDE ECONOMIC
GROWTH IN POOR COUNTRIES, 1997
"INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM" SHOWS</H2>
</CENTER>
<p>
        <B>WASHINGTON</B> -- If there's one thing poor countries don't need, it's more U.S. foreign aid.
<P>
	That's the conclusion of the 1997 "Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> Index of Economic Freedom," a global survey that measures economic freedom -- or the lack of it -- in 150 of the world's 191 countries. On this point the "Index" is clear: It is the level of economic freedom enjoyed by citizens and businesses in a given country, not foreign aid, that matters most in achieving economic growth. 
<p>
	If anything, the study argues, foreign aid does more harm than good. "Instead of helping poor countries lift themselves out of poverty, development aid often impedes their economic growth," says Heritage Policy Analyst <A HREF="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</A>, co-editor of the "Index" along with <A HREF="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</A>, Heritage vice president for foreign policy studies, and Melanie Kirkpatrick, assistant editor of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>'s editorial page. 
<P>
	Economic freedom, by contrast, produces high rates of economic growth. For example, the 10 economically freest countries on the "Index" -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, the Bahamas and the Netherlands -- all have high standards of living. But the 10 least economically free countries -- North Korea, Laos, Cuba, Iraq, Vietnam, Somalia, Libya, Iran, Azerbeijan and Angola and Myanmar -- all suffer from chronic poverty. "The 'Index' demonstrates unequivocally that countries with the highest levels of economic freedom also have the highest living standards," the editors say.
<P>
	A joint publication of <A HREF="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</A>, a prominent Washington-based think tank, and <A HREF="http://wsj.com"><I>The Wall Street Journal</I></A>, the global business newspaper, the "Index" scores the relative freedom of economies based on 10 factors: trade policy, tax policy, government consumption of economic output, monetary policy, foreign investment, wage and price controls, property rights, regulation, and the size of the black market. In each category, a country's economy is assigned a score on a scale from one (best) to five (worst). The 10 least-free economies listed above are not alone. All told, the 1997 "Index" finds, 78 countries are either "mostly unfree" or "repressed," while only 72 countries are "mostly free" or "free."
<P>
<B>The Fruits of Foreign Aid</B>
<P>
	Of the 78 countries ranked as economically unfree, 34 have received U.S. foreign aid for more than three decades, Johnson found. Of these 34 countries, 23 are no better off today than they were in 1965; and of these 23, 13 are actually poorer than they were in 1965.
<P>	"The facts show that no amount of foreign aid can correct conditions caused by economically repressive policies," Johnson says. As evidence, he offers some particularly glaring case studies:
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Haiti</B>, which has relied on U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, remains one of the world's poorest countries. Despite nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid, Haiti's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) fell from $360 in 1965 to $225 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Peru</B> has also received U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, nearly $2 billion worth. Yet its per capita GDP dropped from $1,307 in 1965 to $1,103 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Somalia</B> has taken nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid during the past 41 years, yet its per capita GDP declined from $123 in 1965 to $111 in 1993.
</UL>
<P>
	By contrast, those countries that have graduated to the developed world in the last 20 years -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Chile -- have done so largely without the crutch of foreign aid. The difference, Johnson says, comes down to economic freedom: The "Asian Tigers" and Chile embraced the free-market reforms necessary to spark economic growth, the aid-dependent nations haven't.
<P>
	A comparison of two countries -- Niger and Singapore -- makes the point. While the African nation has received a half a billion dollars in U.S. aid during the past 37 years, its per capita wealth shrank from $617 in 1965 to $272 in 1994 -- a drop of more than 60 percent.  Singapore, by contrast, was cut off from most foreign aid by the late 1960s, yet its per capita GDP has exploded from $1,863 in 1965 to $23,360 in 1994 -- a twelvefold increase. 
<P>
	Similar findings from the first edition of the "Index," published in 1995, led Congress to re-examine how the U.S. government dispenses foreign-aid dollars. In the fiscal year 1996 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, lawmakers included a provision that requires the Agency for International Development (AID) to report to Congress each year on the relative economic freedom of recipient countries.
<P>
	"If development aid is essential to economic prosperity," Johnson asks, "why has there been so little progress by the countries most dependent on foreign aid? The fact is, poverty is largely a condition imposed on people by ill-conceived and repressive economic policies." 
<P>
<B>Economic Freedom Sparks Growth</B>
<P>
	The evidence that economic freedom leads to prosperity is more than anecdotal. In a new chapter added to the "Index" this year, Heritage Foundation economist <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> examines the relationship between a country's degree of economic freedom and its rate of economic growth and finds a statistically significant correlation between the two (at the 99 percent confidence level). "Our analysis strongly suggests that countries with free-market public policies grow faster than countries that discourage economic freedoms," Beach says. 
<P>
	While this may seem obvious, Beach takes pains to stress that it is a country's degree of economic freedom -- not its population growth, access to natural resources, or pace of technological change -- that appears to determine its potential for significant economic growth. He is joined in this conclusion by many economists who espouse what is called "new growth theory," which rejects the view that long-term economic growth happens only by accelerating a country's technological change. Instead, these economists believe a country's "institutional setting" -- its economic freedom, if you will -- most strongly influences growth rates. As Mancur Olson, a leading growth-theory economist quoted by Beach, puts it: "The only ... plausible explanation is that the great differences in the wealth of nations are mainly due to differences in the quality of their institutions and economic policies."
<P>
	This has obvious implications for the world's poorer countries, which need not resign themselves to sub-par economic growth rates, Beach says. "There is no reason that Haiti, or other poor countries, can't achieve economic growth rates that would put their living standards on par with those of developed countries within a generation," he says. 
<P>
	By way of example, Beach notes that if the economy of Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, keeps growing at its current rate, living standards there won't reach those currently enjoyed by the Western nations for another 102 years. But if Bangladesh frees its economy and achieves growth rates on par with those of, say, Singapore, the people of Bangladesh would be living as well as Americans do today in just 40 years. "The key is economic freedom," Beach says.

<p>
	The <a href="dppo-toc.html"><i>Directory of Public Policy Organizations</i></a> is a publication of The Heritage Foundation's <a 
href="/heritage/dept_writeups/rban.htm">Resource Bank</a>. This first 
edition lists public policy organizations that may generally be said to 
share the broadly "conservative" or "classical liberal" point of view. It is 
our hope that this directory will be helpful to the news media, 
government officials, policy groups, academic institutions, and the public 
in locating organizations on the full range of public policy issues.
<p>
	Building the conservative movement is the main function of the 
nineteen-year-old Resource Bank. Part of Heritage's <a 
href="/heritage/dept_writeups/extrel.html">External Relations 
Department</a>, the Resource Bank is a communications link and 
information clearinghouse for some 400 conservative policy groups and 
2,000 conservative experts and scholars around the world. 
<p>
	Its main activities include publishing the monthly <a 
href="rtoc.html#insid"><i>Insider</i></a> newsletter and biennial 
Guide to Public Policy Experts; hosting several regular policy working 
groups; building directories of policy organizations, experts, and 
activists; organizing conferences and meetings of conservative scholars 
and policy group directors; and handling referrals concerning 
conservative groups and experts. 
<p>
	Placing special emphasis on the growing network of grassroots 
and state policy organizations, The Heritage Foundation's Resource 
Bank advances the conservative cause by highlighting the work of other 
conservative groups, promoting strong intra-movement communications, 
and organizing timely leadership strategy forums.

<center><h3>SENATE GOP INTRODUCES LEAD EDUCATION BILL</h3></center>

<p>

Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) last week introduced
the Safe and Affordable Schools Act (S. 1) as a first effort of
Senate Republicans in the 105th Congress to take the offensive
on education.  The bill would provide for low-income voucher demonstration
projects in 20-30 school districts across the nation, and would
make allowances for victims of violence on school grounds to choose
another school -- whether public, private or religious.  S. 1
would allow states to use block grant money under the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act on additional activities, including
parental choice programs, teacher incentive packages and same-sex
schools.

<p>

Title III of the bill is called &quot;The Affordable
College Act.&quot;  It includes several provisions that would
give tax benefits to parents who save for their children's college
education.  For example, parents could place up to $1000 a year
per child into a &quot;Bob Dole Educational Investment Account&quot;
at a 7 percent interest rate.  Disbursements of funds would not
be taxed if used at an accredited college, university or post-secondary
education institution.

<p>

The bill also deals with literacy issues (Title
V), calling for incentive grants for demonstration projects that
would overcome illiteracy with programs of &quot;demonstrated
effectiveness such as systematic phonics.&quot;  Title V would
also establish a 15-member commission to investigate the failure
of the educational system which has resulted in 64 percent of
12th-grade students not reading proficiently.

<p>

S. 1 was introduced on January 21, 1997.  No
legislative action has yet been scheduled.

<p>

<center><h3>EDUCATION SUBCOMMITTEE GOES WEST</h3></center>

<p>

As part of a series called &quot;Education
at a Crossroads,&quot; the House Education and the Workforce Committee
held field hearings in California and Arizona this week.  These
were the first of fifteen hearings Oversight Subcommittee Chairman
Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) plans to hold at sites across the
country this year in an effort to show &quot;what works&quot;
and &quot;what's wasted&quot; in education.  According to Rep.
Hoekstra, the hearings are intended to focus on local successes
while investigating the burden of federal regulation.

<p>

But reports from the first hearing, held in
Napa Valley on Wednesday, indicate that the majority of witnesses
favored government programs.  Representatives Frank Riggs (R-Calif.),
Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) and Hoekstra heard testimony
from 11 witnesses.  Only two of them -- both parents -- pointed
to the failure of spending and federal programs to improve students'
academic performance and the problems with whole language and
Outcome-Based Education.

<p>

Though in the minority, their comments resonated
with the audience of about 200 who had gathered at the New Technology
High School in Napa.  Witness Dorothy Erickson, parent and president
of a National Right to Read Foundation chapter, said her testimony
was interrupted three times by applause, while other witnesses'
praise for California's School-to-Careers program left the audience
cold.

<p>

<i>Ed Facts</i> awaits feedback from the second hearing in Los Angeles, 
on phonics v. whole language, and this morning's hearing in Phoenix, on 
charter schools.  Future hearings in the &quot;Education at a 
Crossroads&quot; series will be announced as information becomes available.

<p>

<title>Legislative Hotline</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/hotline/hotline.gif"></center>

<p>

<center><h2>Hotline for Week of January 31-February 7</h2></center>

<p>

Welcome to the FRC information line. This message will be updated
Friday, Feb. 7th at the close of business.

<p>

Although Capitol Hill has been relatively involved with confirmation
hearings for Clinton Cabinet appointees, several other issues
have continued to develop.  Among these issues is pro-family 
<a href="#social">Social Security reform</a>, 
<a href="#family">international family planning</a>, and continuing
oppression in San Francisco by <a href="#homosexual">homosexual 
activists</a>.

<p><a name="social">

<h3>Issue One. Pro-family Social Security Reform.</h3>

<p>

On Monday, January 20th, <I>The New York Times</I> ran an editorial by Gary
Bauer, President of the Family Research Council, calling on lawmakers
to preserve the pro-family provisions within our Social Security
system.  The editorial questioned the lack of protection privatization
would offer to America's widows, orphans, and our senior citizens,
and the tax increases average Americans would be saddled with
during the transition.  Bauer cautioned that Social Security does
need reforms and adjustments in order to safeguard its solvency
and prevent a budget crunch, but the ideas being pushed by some
Republicans and libertarian think tanks are bad policy and bad
politics.  Currently Social Security provides compensation for
couples who devote their early years to raising children and it
gives survivor benefits to stay-at-home moms and orphaned children.
Privatization plans leave these widows and orphans out in the
cold.  And they'd mean huge tax increases for over-taxed families.
Privatization also assumes, unrealistically, a booming stock market
for the next 20 years.  In opposition to the recommendations of
the Social Security Advisory Council, Family Research Council
proposes three reforms to save the pro-family policies in our
Social Security system.  First, we have proposed gradually downsizing
of the benefit structure to close the demographic deficit that
will come with the retirement of the baby boomers.  Second, the
current retirement age should be adjusted and indexed to reflect
change in life expectancy among those currently in the workforce.
Third, the payroll tax should be cut by 20% for both workers
and employers, with workers who benefit from the tax cut receiving
a commensurate reduction in growth of future benefits.  Families
work hard to make great sacrifices to raise their children.  They
deserve security when they retire.  While pushing for reform,
FRC will fight to save the pro-family provisions of the Social
Security system.

<p><a name="family">

<h3>Issue Two. International Family Planning.</h3>

<p>

The first pro-life
vote of the 105th Congress will take place mid-February, when
members decide whether or not to release an additional $123 million
to international organizations, of which many perform and promote
abortions as a method of family planning. Last year, the White
House rejected a congressional proposal which would have allowed
$300 million <I>more</I> to go to international family planning.
Why? Because the proposal stipulated that groups could not perform
or actively promote abortions. So essential was abortion to the
administration's &quot;population&quot; mission that population
groups sacrificed $300 million rather than accept pro-life conditions
to the money. From the development assistance budget, more money
is spent on population control than on child survival programs
and other foreign-aid priorities. Pro-life members of Congress
plan to offer an alternative measure which would allow groups
money for international family planning <I>but only</I> if they
agree not to perform or promote abortions. Please contact your
Congressman and Senators and urge them to vote AGAINST the Clinton
administration's resolution and FOR international family planning
restriction proposed by pro-life Members of Congress. Abortion
is not family planning.

<p><a name="homosexual">

<h3>Issue Three. Continuing Oppression by Homosexual Activists
in San Francisco.</h3>

<p>

Earlier this month, the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors instituted a new ordinance requiring companies
that wish to do business in San Francisco to offer &quot;domestic
partnership&quot; benefits to their homosexual employees.  The
Board blocked a United Airlines request for a lease at the San
Francisco airport because the carrier does not extend domestic
partnership benefits to its gay employees.  But now Archbishop
William Levada of San Francisco has asked Mayor Brown to exempt
Catholic Charities, a non-profit charity which provides $5.5 million
worth of services to the city, from compliance with the new ordinance.
Archbishop Leveda argued the ordinance violates the Church's &quot;ethical
tenets&quot; by mandating that it subsidize a lifestyle which
the Church teaches is intrinsically disordered, immoral, and in
no sense equal to a traditional marriage between one man and one
woman. The Catholic Archdiocese argues that the city's domestic
partnership ordinance violates Catholics' &quot;freedom of religion.&quot;
Mayor Brown argues that Catholic Charities is a service provider,
not a religious institution and therefore should not be exempt
from an ordinance which the city claims is about discrimination.
It is clear from this example that men and women of faith must
be engaged in the political process. What's happening in San Francisco
shows us that we're in a war over values that only one side is
going to win. Nothing less than freedom itself is at stake.

<title>Daily Commentary - February 7, 1997</title>

<body>

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
February 7, 1997</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Well, there's more disturbing news out from the IRS.  Years ago
we were told that a new computer system would make the processing
of our tax returns more efficient.  Now $4 <I>billion</I> later
we're told the computer has crashed.

<p>

On top of that, the IRS is thinking of contracting out the processing
of individual tax returns.  That would mean that the private financial
information of ordinary people like you would be in the hands
of whatever company the government hired to do the work. 

<p>

They're also talking about starting over again with a new plan
to develop another computer to process returns.  Won't they ever
learn?  I've got a better idea: how about scrapping the tax system
all together and replacing it with one that's simple and fair.

<p>

The IRS is a big mess, and it's only getting worse as horror
stories of corruption, incompetence and inefficiency keep coming
to light.  It's no wonder tax season is one of the most stressful
times of the year.

<p>

American families and businesses deserve better.  It's time to
take our tax laws back to the drawing board.  It's time to let
America's families keep more of what they earn.

<p>

For Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with today's
Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call 1-800-225-4008.

<center><h2>TO IMPROVE THE STATE OF THE UNION:<br>
EMPOWER PARENTS, RENEW THE CULTURE,<br>
BAUER SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In response to the State of the Union
address by President Clinton and remarks by Oklahoma Rep. J.C.
Watts (R), Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer called
on Congress today to draw on the strengths of both presentations
to produce an agenda that will serve the cause of family and cultural
renewal. &quot;What we heard last night,&quot; Bauer said, &quot;were
two appeals  that undoubtedly resonated with the majority of Americans,
whose deepest concerns have less to do with technology and trade
than with the temper of our times and the character of our nation.&quot;

<p>

&quot;President Clinton's speech was a deliberate and often successful
reach for the mainstream. <B>About the cultural issues of right
and wrong, the President was almost totally silent</B>,&quot;
Bauer said, &quot;but his remarks on issues from drugs and crime
to safe schools and community empowerment represent the ideals
of most men and women in our nation.  On issues from the nation's
overall economic output, to education, to welfare reform, the
President's praise for American ingenuity and 'call to Action'
in the coming century represent an appropriate summons to this
nation's hopeful spirit.&quot;

<p>

&quot;In the days to come,&quot; Bauer said, &quot;the Family
Research Council will examine the President's detailed proposals
as they emerge. For now, we welcome the fact that the President
has identified numerous needs and taken modest steps in the direction
of meeting them.  He is right to recognize that American families
are profoundly concerned about their ability to educate their
children. To meet this need, he has proposed targeted tax relief
and public school choice. FRC favors tax relief with a much bigger
target, and choice with a much wider array of options. <B>Any
summit designed to increase parental involvement in education
is doomed to fail if it does not maximize the financial resources
of parents</B> so that they can choose better schools for their
children -- of all ages.

<p>

&quot;If we cannot trust parents to choose their child's schools,
how can we ever trust them to be involved in that school in a
constructive way? The family home is our nation's real 'empowerment
zone,' and real tax relief that recognizes the value of human
capital must begin there.

<p>

&quot;We completely agree that politics should stop at the schoolhouse
door. But that cannot happen when we pull all education decision-making
into Washington. After all, every Member of  Congress and the
administration is a partisan politician. The president's proposals
to expand the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards
will only strengthen the stranglehold liberal elites already have
over teacher certification. They will spend our money to threaten
the independence and integrity of private schools, religious schools
and home schools. These schools have been meeting the highest
education goals without federal interference.

<p>

&quot;<B>American kids should be reading by the end of <I>first</I>
grade</B>, not wait until the end of third grade, as the President
proposes. This used to happen all over America. The state of California
is showing real leadership in requiring systematic phonics instruction.
A million volunteers cannot teach a single child to read if they
themselves cannot read.&quot;

<p>

On other issues raised on State of the Union night, Bauer commented:

<p>

<li>&quot;The President's pledge to halve the number of children
who go without <B>health insurance</B> coverage is laudable. Again,
however, we must empower parents to purchase and provide this
coverage.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;If we truly want to 'challenge' the nation's artists,
we must ask them to create their works with the same independence
of energy and spirit that animated our nation's writers and painters
for centuries before the advent of the <B>National Endowment for
the Arts</B>. Rescuing this federal handout for a favored few
is morally wrong; moreover, it is thoroughly unnecessary in the
booming economy the President toasted last night.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;Perhaps <B>the biggest disappointment of the night</B>
was President Clinton's omission of any mention of the impending
harm that will be done this summer to American values when the
fate of <B>Hong Kong</B> is decided. We cannot celebrate the prospects
for a democratic opening in Cuba and ignore the jaws of tyranny
closing in China.  The President's failure to speak the plain
truth about the <B>deterioration of human rights</B> in the vast
nation of China, truth underscored in his own State Department's
new report, made his strong words about emerging democracies in
Central America and Eastern Europe ring hollow. In those laudable
cases, American Presidents -- particularly Ronald Reagan -- stood
firmly for personal freedom, religious liberty and democratic
self-governance.

<p>

&quot;Who can forget President Reagan's bold challenge: 'Tear
down that wall, Mr. Gorbachev!' The Berlin Wall didn't come down
because of some amorphous sense of 'inevitability.' It came down
because leaders like Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II, and Aleksander
Solzhenitsyn had  the moral courage to stand up to oppressive
tyrants.  That kind of moral leadership is needed today on behalf
of more than one billion men, women and children who are systematically
and cruelly abused by a despotic regime in Communist China. Their
six million brothers and sisters in Hong Kong, who were promised
that they would maintain their basic freedoms after July 1, 1997,
likewise need and deserve America's moral leadership to make their
fundamental human rights a reality.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;Access to the <B>Internet</B> for every American 12-year-old
from a computer in every home is not merely an issue of fiber
optics, but of the fiber of our people. The President's goal simply
cannot and will not be reached if the problem of pervasive pornography
on the Internet is not resolved. In this regard, what the President's
appointees on the Supreme Court do with the <B>Communications
Decency Act</B> will make all the difference. The same can be
said for most of the family values agenda: neither strong rhetoric
nor wide laws will matter much if our courts continue to erase
what our elected leaders have enacted and signed.&quot;

A drill sergeant's brilliant assault on juvenile crime</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<STRONG>Over the last five years, 775 young criminals -- some convicted of drug-dealing, robbery, and assault -- have taken Sergeant Roger Redd's crash course in law and order. All but a handful have stayed out of trouble. Here's how a former drill sergeant uses physical and moral discipline to shake men loose from a life of crime.
</STRONG>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's early morning in Fayetteville, North Carolina, home to the army's 82nd Airborne Division. Thirty pairs of feet shuffle clumsily to the cadence of a husky-voiced sergeant. Perhaps it's a little too early for some of these recruits, who are having trouble following orders. "Don't show me a grin, I'm not a dentist," snaps Sergeant Roger Redd. "Don't anticipate the command. Pay attention. Engage the brain, engage the brain."

<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although the rows of young men with closely cropped hair may resemble greenhorn troops from nearby Fort Bragg, the scene is deceptive. The men are not recruits -- they're criminals. And this isn't boot camp, it's the parking lot of the Cumberland County courthouse.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"You say you got in trouble, you can't do anything with your life," Redd says. "Wrong answer. You decided to break the law. You made a mistake, but now you're going to profit from it. You're going to do right."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Welcome to Sergeant Redd's physical-training program, a court-approved plan to turn troublemakers on probation into law-abiding citizens. Redd, a court bailiff and former army drill sergeant, oversees a military-style regimen three mornings a week that mixes physical discipline, mental toughness, and common-sense counseling. Less than a chain gang but more than a Jane Fonda workout, Redd's 90-day program is being hailed locally as one of the most successful efforts anywhere to take youthful offenders otherwise bound for prison and turn their lives around. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a few hours, Redd will be busy at his paying job: handcuffing suspects, breaking up fights, and escorting criminals to court or to jail. But now, at just after 5 a.m., he's volunteering to steer these youngsters away from a lawless future by giving them some private lessons on crime and punishment. One at a time, they stand up and explain how they got into trouble with the law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I was charged with auto theft," one mumbles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"You were stealing cars," says Redd, pacing slowly.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"I wasn't stealin' cars. I was stealin' car parts."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"What were you gonna' do," Redd fires back, "put a car together?"
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"No."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Get down and push. It's 'no, <i>sir</i>!' "
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The boy drops to the ground and starts doing push-ups while others stand and recite their stories. No one else forgets to say "sir."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But Redd isn't through with them yet. "If you're used to using your conscience every day, then you're not going to go out and do something stupid," he says. "By the time you leave here, you should be remorseful for what you've done." His aim: teach personal responsibility and break the men of their "I'm a victim" mentality. Until that happens, Redd says, he won't be able to shake them loose from criminal behaviors and keep them out of prison.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Make no mistake: Prison is exactly where most of the men, ages 16 to 21, are headed. "Most come to this program because they failed every other method to keep them out of the Department of Corrections," says court administrator Kim Tucker. "This is the last stop."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All are on probation for committing a nonviolent offense, such as breaking and entering, larceny, or drug possession. Many are repeat offenders, whose crimes as juveniles -- which are expunged from public record -- include arson, robbery, and even assault with a deadly weapon. Virtually all of them have violated the conditions of their probation, and are one step away from prison. "Most of them have never been taught discipline or respect," says Redd. "They're used to doing what they want to, on their own, when they get good and ready. And suddenly now someone's in charge telling them what to do and how not to do it. It's a shock to them."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This may be just the kind of shock therapy needed to jolt young lawbreakers to their senses. About 775 of the 875 men and women who've entered the program have gone on to complete it. According to the county court, only 15 of the graduates have been charged with subsequent criminal offenses. Redd, who keeps a file of each of his graduates, says that 65 have joined the army, and many have completed high school and gotten jobs. "I'm in a position to see a lot of young men come through here," says assistant district attorney Charles Scott, who regularly refers men to the program. "We've seen a very small number come back." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Criminal-justice officials say they know of no other alternatives to prison -- not boot camps, not home surveillance, not work programs -- that approach the program's success rates. "It's the best alternative sentencing program that I'm aware of in the state of North Carolina, and maybe nationally, in terms of results achieved," says E. Lynn Johnson, a superior-court judge who helped Redd launch the effort more than five years ago. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd got the idea after helplessly watching teens and young adults stream in and out of court -- men who, in Redd's view, needed a muscular dose of physical and moral discipline. But they weren't likely to get that from the state's probation system or from imprisonment. "Think about it. In prison you get free education, exercise, television," says Art Zeidman, a candidate for superior-court judge who has run alternatives-to-prison programs in Raleigh. "For the first-time offender, the system is one of a comfortable cocoon, and they don't feel a need to stay away from it." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Patricia Timmons Goodson, a district-court judge in Cumberland County, says she was "not satisfied at all" with her sentencing options. Supervised probation, a commonly used alternative to prison, often fails because a mere handful of county probation officers are asked to track nearly 1,900 youthful offenders now in the system. "You would continue to see many -- too many -- of the same young people coming back," she says.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd was convinced his army experience offered a solution. Participants in his program enter a structured training environment a few hours a day, three days a week, for three months. They must arrive on time, wear uniforms, and learn basic drills. They also receive regular warnings to stay in school, along with practical instruction about finding and keeping jobs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Add to this Redd's blend of personal and professional grit: He grew up poor in a family of eight children; signed up for three tours in Vietnam as an infantry combat soldier; piloted an attack helicopter that was gunned down over Hamburger Hill; received five Purple Hearts for being wounded five times; spent six months in a hospital bed with a foot wound while doctors fretted that he would never walk again; and retired, a first sergeant with the 82nd Airborne, after 22 years in the military.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd's approach offers both a carrot and a stick. Graduates avoid jail and might also see the court relax their probation requirements. Nongraduates head straight to jail. Redd decides who is fit to graduate -- with no second chances and no appeals.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	An early believer, Judge Johnson first began referring men to the program in February 1991. Today, virtually every judge, district attorney, and probation officer in the county's court system scouts out offenders who might be good candidates. Court officers such as Goodson regularly don sneakers and sweats and join Redd in the morning to speak to his latest crop of students. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The key to Redd's strategy is using the best of his military training to reinforce good habits and, eventually, good attitudes. That includes regular drills, countless push-ups, five-mile runs, and swift consequences for disobeying commands. For these men, many of whom have dropped out of high school and haven't held a job, getting up and getting to the courthouse on time is a milestone in personal discipline.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Everyone gets a chance to act as a squad leader, yelling out drill commands. The reason: Many kids who get into trouble do so because they are followers, easily drawn into crime when they're idle. "The man is totally in control of his actions. He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, but he still has a great time," says Wesley, one of Redd's graduates who returns a few mornings a month to help train others in the program. "He's teaching them to act independently, not to go along with the crowd."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The approach differs from many boot-camp experiments, however, because it offers much more than a physical regimen. Says Johnson: "It goes beyond just physically getting in their faces and teaching them how many push-ups they can do, but teaching them to be a man or a woman along the way."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	How does the sergeant teach young men about manhood? In Redd's equation, it's the little decisions that matter, the choices that eventually add up to excellence and integrity. So when he sees his troops marching out of formation, he pounces. "That's raggedy," he barks. "I said a straight row. That's like being on your job and they want you to make sure the pots and pans are put away and they're clean. You do it and you do it <i>right</i>. Men have <i>discipline</i>."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd also counsels the men, individually and in groups. They never seem to know when he'll launch into a mini-sermon about responsibility, honesty, or conscience. Sometimes Redd will focus on building their self-respect: "Every one of you sitting here, from left to right, is just as good as I am. But now you've got a temporary setback," he says. "What you have to do is keep yourself straight and work hard." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	During his speech, Redd spots a late arrival who tries to slip into formation. He doesn't miss a beat: "Get down and <i>push!</i> If you're late tomorrow, just keep on running, right to jail. Because you're going to jail, because you can't follow instructions. You have an obligation and responsibility to yourself to get here on time."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At other times, he presses home the obligation to show respect for others. One of his favorite phrases: "People have the right to be left alone." Redd asks the men to picture themselves as adult parents (some of them are), and to imagine one of their children dying of a cocaine overdose, or a stab wound, or from gun fire. "I want them to realize they would not want this to happen to their child," he says later. "So I place them in a predicament. It makes them wake up and think. Now we're engaging the brain."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After less than a week in the program, Mike's brain already is engaged. He was convicted of burglary and assault with a weapon. Now, during a short break between drills, he says he's determined to graduate so he can clear his record. He's studying computer programming at Fayetteville Technical Training College. "I'm trying to think about the future," he says. Wesley, the recent grad who volunteers as a squad leader, was arrested on drug charges but now works as a graphic artist. "It gave me a real hope that I could still make something of myself," he says, "regardless of the past." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd usually works with about 50 men at a time (plus an occasional woman or two), and nearly 90 percent of them graduate. They might be rewarded with termination of their probation, fewer hours of community service, or reduced fines. Court officials hold a graduation ceremony for each class, and distribute diplomas and special awards donated by community groups, including a tuition scholarship to a local community college. The graduates, all wearing white shirts and black ties, often will pause to thank Redd for being tough on them and convincing them they could make it.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"You can see the care in him," says Kathy Bond, the county's chief probation officer. "You see that hard-nosed soldier, but then you see that other side of him, too -- that compassionate person that really wants to help somebody." That's a combination most of these men have rarely glimpsed before. Many grew up with no father in the home. Some live with cousins or grandmothers or on the streets. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	They're usually surprised when Redd offers to take them to church, or out to breakfast, or to help arrange a job interview, or negotiate their sentence with the district attorney. Near the end of one session, Redd has the men stand and explain what they've gotten out of the program so far. Says one boy, "For once the system is not working against me, but working for me."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Straight talk about responsibility and respect, physical discipline that reinforces basic life skills, and a caring but hard-as-nails authority figure -- could that be a formula for breaking the cycle of juvenile crime?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I think it can be duplicated," says Judge Goodson, "but it's going to take a person that is just as tough . . . and just as committed as Roger Redd." Cumberland County doesn't spend a dime on the program: Redd takes no money for directing the effort, works during his off-hours, uses no county facilities, and asks the local Chamber of Commerce to donate uniforms as needed. By keeping hundreds of offenders out of jail, he calculates, he saves the county $41 a day, or about $6.5 million over the last five years.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Says Judge Johnson: "Roger's experiment here could be contagious." The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that at least 520,000 of the nation's juveniles are placed on probation each year. With numbers like that, we should hope for an epidemic.<p><i><b>Joe Loconte</b> is the deputy editor of</i> Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship.

<h2>Bellwethers of Realignment</h2>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Will the surprise election of a Republican majority in the 104th Congress prove to be the first cannonball fired in a full-scale conservative revolution in the federal government, or merely a brief surgical strike to redirect an overreaching president's imprudent agenda? That question, of course, will be determined by the historians.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Regardless of the outcome of the congressional races this November, state legislatures around the country are providing an irrefutable case for an emerging nationwide trend toward a conservative governing philosophy of traditional values, free-market solutions, and smaller government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Eighteen state legislative chambers have switched from Democratic to Republican control since the 1994 election -- either by direct election or their legislators' party-switching. (One of these, the Wisconsin senate, reverted back to Democratic rule, but only after a Republican senator was recalled by voters for his support of a tax increase.)<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On the national level, conservatism and its standard bearers in Congress haven't had an easy year. Many voters who were enamored of the ideas of Republican candidates in November 1994 are expressing doubt to pollsters that the person they voted for should remain in office in 1997.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the important thing to remember is that the left's attack on the 104th Congress has focused on the messenger of conservative government -- House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- and not the message. To their apparent advantage in polls, challengers to conservative members of congress lambaste their opponents' allegiance to the vilified and unpopular Speaker.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This tactic won't work in state legislative races, where most conservative candidates have never met Gingrich, much less voted with him. State office-seekers are able to separate themselves from the government shutdowns and default threats that haunt many of their federal counterparts and concentrate on the local issues that characterize the devolution of Big Government.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Here are the key states to watch on November 5th for evidence of the conservative agenda's progress:<p>	<center><b>Florida</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jeb Bush doesn't think it's necessarily the big changes in this state that highlight Florida's growing conservatism. "It's just a continued, constant march towards changing the relationship of government to the people," explains Bush, who came within 2 percentage points of defeating Lawton Chiles for the governorship in 1994. This past legislative session marks the first time since Reconstruction that Florida's senate is Republican-controlled. And come November, the house will go the way of the senate if the GOP can capture three seats. They are very optimistic: 11 of the 12 representatives retiring this year are Democrats, and most are from districts that Bush, the son of President George Bush, carried over Chiles in his narrow loss.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The mainstay of the Democrats' re-election strategy is their no-new-taxes votes and a record of holding growth in the state budget to only 2 percent this session, reports Susan McManus, a professor of public administration and political science at the University of South Florida. "Florida, like the nation at large, has become more conservative over the years," McManus wrote in a recent paper.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"There's no question Florida is shifting to the right, both philosophically and in terms of party registration," says John Smith, the vice president of the James Madison Institute, in Tallahassee. He cites as examples Florida's stringent welfare bill, which is currently awaiting approval from the federal government; tough crime measures; and a new charter-school system. If Republicans take the senate, a school-voucher bill that died during this session has an excellent chance of passage.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most indicative of the conservatism blossoming in Florida is the slowing of the state spending machine. Since 1983, Smith says, state spending increases averaged $2.4 billion a year. But spending increases in the two most recent budgets have averaged just $500 million. According to Smith, the 1994 state and federal elections and the spending-cap amendment Floridians voted for (also in 1994) are responsible for this encouraging trend.<p><center><b>Iowa</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The 1994 electoral tidal wave washed over Iowa's lower chamber, enlarging the Republicans' 51-49 majority to 63-37, but it left the senate in Democratic control by a margin of 27-24. Will the November election be a victory for conservatives in the senate?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It will give them a Republican majority -- but not a conservative influence. That will probably take another election cycle," admits Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican and a rising prospect for the governorship. (Governor Terry Branstad is not seeking re-election in 1998.) As a member of the senate from 1989 until 1994, Pate struggled to shepherd conservative bills through his own Republican caucus. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Pate is confident that some of the Republican candidates running to replace retiring Democrats are solid conservatives who will advance the ball next session. The death penalty, parental notification for minors seeking abortions, and regulatory relief are some major issues Iowa conservatives have been pushing, and all have been obstructed by the Democratic senate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The senate was the roadblock to getting any tax cuts at all," says Robert Solt, the research director of Iowans for Tax Relief, of the past legislative session. Under GOP rule, the House introduced an income-tax reduction bill that was supported by Branstad, but thwarted by the more liberal senate. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eventually the senate compromised and passed a property-tax relief bill. Pointing to this year's state budget surplus of $200 million (compared to 1992's $400 million debt), Solt sees ample opportunity for tax cuts next session if Republicans capture the senate. And Pate cites capital gains and inheritance-tax relief as top priorities of the next legislative session, provided Republicans pick up two senate seats and majority control.<p><center><b>Maine</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Bethel Furniture Stock, located near Maine's border with New Hampshire, makes wood parts for furniture. Leon Favreau is the firm's president and part owner. Although he doesn't consider himself a conservative, he remarks that the country, and especially Maine, have grown more conservative over recent years. His biggest concern of late is a referendum put on the state ballot by environmentalists that would outlaw the harvesting of trees throughout most of the state. "It has the possibility of forcing our operation to close overnight," he says.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a state supposedly growing more conservative, how does this threat to the economy gain so much steam? Freshman state representative Lisa Lumbra, a Maine native, explains that residents of the state tend to mind their own business, so the governing is usually left to liberal activists. But a bill passed by the state legislature in 1993 granting special rights to homosexuals served as a wakeup call. A recount after the 1994 election turned control of the senate over to the GOP, and left Republicans in the house one seat shy of a majority.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Lumbra is worried that the senate will not be able to retain its control with the retirement of two conservative stalwarts, but the chances of her party becoming the majority in the house are high. Even as the minority party, house Republicans were able to stop funding for a Goals 2000 bill, pass a 15 percent tax cut pending a budget surplus, and stop a $12 million state health program that covered family planning but not hospitalization costs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even if Republicans lose the senate, "the conservative trend will be obvious," Lumbra predicts. There are a few conservative Democrats who will be instrumental in passing a tax cut independent of a budget surplus, deregulating the tree-harvesting industry, and scaling down the state's intrusive Department of Human Services, which Lumbra cites as her constituents' top complaint. Leon Favreau might not consider himself a conservative, but he is voting Republican this year.<p><center><b>Nevada</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Serious welfare reform, mirroring Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson's plan, was stalled in the assembly this year after votes on the bill were cast entirely along party lines. It tied 21-21. In its place, the assembly passed a welfare bill authorizing more money for employment programs and counseling.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans and Democrats have shared the chairmanship over the assembly chamber, which was brought to parity in the 1994 election. All but one of the six representatives retiring this year are Democrats, however, and Republican registration in the state exceeded 50 percent this year for the first time. If all goes as planned, it's round two in Nevada for real welfare reform. Republicans will retain their majority in the senate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even if Republicans are unable to take the chamber, "there may be enough external pressure from the president's signature on the federal welfare bill for Democrats to support statewide reform," says Judy Cresanta, the president of the Nevada Policy Research Institute.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Cresanta also thinks that a Republican assembly would take a crack at nepotism in the teachers union and pass property-rights legislation, a winner with voters in a state where 80 percent of the land is owned by the federal government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And there's good news for Nevadans on the economic front, too. Carol Vilardo, the president of the Nevada Taxpayers' Association, says, "This is the first year we didn't have to go in [to the legislative session] looking to raise taxes." That's because in the 1991 session, the legislature put an end to automatic spending increases for the coming year based on last year's revenues. This is the first year the new policy's effects were felt.<p><center><b>North Carolina</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The booming Research Triangle and Charlotte metropolitan areas have attracted many urban Yankees over the past decade, which would lead one to assume that the land of Jesse Helms has taken on a liberal tinge. But judging from the size of the gains Republicans made in the general assembly and state senate in 1994 (when they took over the assembly and wound up two seats shy of a majority in the senate), one is prompted to reconsider.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Grassroots Research, a Charlotte-based public opinion company, recently conducted a poll of 500 registered North Carolina voters and found that 81 percent disapprove of the race-based admissions standards at the University of North Carolina, 76 percent favor a constitutional amendment for congressional term limits, and 74 percent believe that someone who earns twice as much as they do should pay no more than twice as much in taxes. This same sample of voters splits its support between Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt and Republican incumbent Jesse Helms in this year's U.S. Senate race. That indicates that, while North Carolinians have doubts about a person associated with conservative ideas this November, they cling faithfully to a conservative agenda.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"The trend in North Carolina to be more fiscally conservative and certainly more conservative all around has extended to the Republican Party," observes senate Minority Leader Betsy Cochran. She foresees her party capturing a slim majority in the senate this fall. If so, a pilot program for school vouchers has an good chance of passage, tough welfare reform will be introduced, and quite possibly, affirmative action will be addressed in a "methodical, deliberative manner," she says. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These plans depend on Republicans retaining their majority in the Assembly, and at this point "it's very difficult to predict with any accuracy what's going to happen," says John Hood, the president of the John Locke Foundation, a think tank in Raleigh. Hood wonders whether Republicans can effectively make the case for their election to the public, given the popularity that Democratic governor Jim Hunt has won by cutting taxes after the 1994 elections jolted the legislature. If they really want to distinguish themselves from Democrats, Hood says, they need to go after affirmative action. They just might.<p><center><b>Washington</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I know every state claims to be the most liberal in the nation, but we've proved it over the years," laughs Bill Baldwin, the president of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies. But with the prospect of property-tax reduction and regulatory and welfare reform sailing through the legislature next session, Washington is looking a lot different these days.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	When asked about his state's facelift, Senator Dan McDonald, the majority leader, suggests it's "probably because the last million to million and  a half people who have moved to Washington state are more conservative than the people who were their predecessors." He cites an increase in the number of suburban voters and social conservatives in his state as reasons for this trend.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1994, when Republicans picked up 25 house seats (a phenomenon widely attributed to the popularity of the term-limits movement), it was their biggest proportional legislative gain in the country. They control the house 62-36, and are only one seat away for a majority in the senate. Baldwin is optimistic that the policies his think tank endorses will be enacted next year, because twice as many Democrats as Republicans are retiring from the senate this year.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Washingtonians will also elect a governor this year, and if it's a Republican, says Baldwin, there is a good chance that the GOP will be able to repeal the state labor law and start privatizing some of its services. What would another Democratic governor do to Baldwin's agenda? "We'll just put referendum clauses on a lot of these things, bypass the governor, and bring these issues straight to the people," says McDonald.<p><center><b>Wisconsin</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The 1994 gains made by the GOP suffered a setback when Republican state senator George Petak was recalled for breaking his promise and voting for a tax increase to fund a sports stadium. The GOP lost its fragile one-seat majority, and now the GOP must protect the assembly and take back the senate. Before Petak's recall, this legislative session's reform-minded agenda had attracted national attention. Governor Tommy Thompson's rise to the vice presidential short-list was due almost entirely to the welfare reform bill passed by the legislature. "Welfare reform never would have come up for a vote under a Democratically controlled legislature . . . but the final vote was overwhelmingly supportive," says Mary Jo Pauke of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another issue that never would have been addressed is abortion, but under the Republican leadership parental-consent and waiting-period laws were passed into law. Pretty ambitious for one term, but conservatives aren't content to rest on their laurels.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"For the first time in Wisconsin, people are actually going to see their tax bill go down," notes Steve Baas, the communications director for Assembly Majority Leader Scott Jensen. Republicans are campaigning on a $1-billion tax-relief package as next session's legislative centerpiece that would protect the property-tax cut passed this year, eliminate the marriage penalty in the Wisconsin tax code, give working families a tax credit, implement a supermajority rule for tax increases, and provide a 100 percent capital-gains exemption for family farms and business.

<h2>Shalom for At-Risk Youth</h2>
<b>By Heidi Goldsmith</b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans across the political spectrum are talking about the value of boarding schools for poor children from broken families and violent neighborhoods. They say we need more residential schools like Piney Woods Country Life School in Mississippi, Boys Town in Nebraska, and the Milton Hershey School, Girard College, and Scotland School for Veterans' Children in Pennsylvania. Despite their troubled families and neighborhoods, the vast majority of students from these schools graduate and go on to college, the military, or jobs.  <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The major barriers to opening new residential schools are high costs and scarce funds. Annual per-student costs range from around $22,000 at Piney Woods, Girard, and the Job Corps, to $45,000 at others. The creators of a few residential charter schools on the drawing board anticipate annual costs of approximately $26,000 per student. <p>

 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Israel's network of 70 children and youth villages offers a model for successful and modestly priced residential schools. Residential education is more widely available in Israel than anywhere else: About 7 percent of Israeli youth attend these schools, at a cost of $6,500 to $9,000 per year. Israel's system comprises child-centered communities for "normal" children who have troubled home environments. The message to the students is, "What your family cannot provide you, the community will." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Based on a hybrid of the European boarding schools and the "kibbutz" (communal settlement), Israel's residential education system began in 1933, when thousands of Jewish children were rescued from the Holocaust in Europe and brought to what would become the State of Israel. Special residential schools were created to care for these young, traumatized refugees. Since then, these schools have adapted to the changing demographics and needs of young Israelis who, for various reasons, lack sufficient support from their families. Many of Israel's top politicians (including Shimon Peres), artists, military heroes, and business executives are graduates of these schools. Roughly half the students today are neglected or abused Israelis born in Israel. The other half are new immigrants, mainly from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Costs are lower in Israel than in America in part because staff salaries are approximately one-third of comparable U.S. salaries. But Israeli youth villages are less expensive also because they are burdened by fewer regulations than American schools. The typical residential student-to-staff ratio in Israel is 10:1; the ideal is 6:1. The norm for residential care in the United States is 4:1, though in some states and programs it is 1:1. Israeli youth villages tend not to have psychological counselors or social workers on staff, as is often required by state regulations in this country. They do not have to provide two adults during the night for every 12 youths, as required by many states. Nor must they hire registered nurses or residential supervisors with Licensed Social Worker degrees (LICSWs), unlike American facilities that wish to qualify for funding from programs such as Medicaid. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We use psychology, not psychologists; child development theory, not social workers," says Zvi Levy, the director of WIZO-Hadassim Youth Village, near Netanya, Israel. He focuses on developing a child's abilities, not offering therapy for her problems. Instead of "experts" with degrees in counseling, Levy likes to hire positive role models -- adults, usually married, who have served in the military, who have finished high school and usually college, who naturally relate well to the students. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Levy's youth village has 45 residential staff for 500 students. "Too many staff means too much structure," he says. Students' input and assistance is therefore needed and encouraged. The village has two rules for both staff and students: Never hurt anyone, physically or emotionally, and attend school. Students otherwise have enormous freedom to plan their free time. Instead of devising programs specific to each student, the school sets goals and provides a simple, well-planned environment with strong community norms where students learn to navigate the setting at their own speed. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fewer regulations does not mean less accountability. The real measure of whether these programs are effective comes years later: Are graduates employed, taxpaying citizens? Have they formed healthy relationships and created strong families? Using these measures, a 25-year study by the University of Haifa concluded the villages were very effective. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Israeli youth villages are largely funded by the equivalent of voucher programs. The Ministry of Education pays to a residential school what it would otherwise pay for a student's education elsewhere. The residential component is paid to the school by either the Ministry of Welfare or The Ministry of Immigration. Private funds supplement the public funds, adding 10 percent to 20 percent of the school budget. American residential schools could benefit from similar flexibility. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Residential schools offer enormous potential for addressing the problems of America's troubled youth. We could have more of them if we applied the community and child development approach, and enjoyed the same flexibility in regulation and funding of Israel's villages.

<h2>EPA Greenmails the States</h2>
<b>By Jessica Gavora</b>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Here's a statistic that would make Joe Six-Pack wince. The Coors brewery in Golden, Colorado, spills between 18 and 22 million gallons of beer every year as it overfills its cans and bottles to force the air out before they're sealed. That's a foamy runoff of about a six-pack a second. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One man's brewsky, of course, is another man's "volatile organic compound." VOC -- that's how Colorado environmental officials classify the evaporating ethanol given off by all that spilled beer. VOCs can be harmful in large amounts, but until 1993 breweries like Coors were thought to be minor-league emitters of these naturally occurring toxins. <p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=center>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But then Coors did something controversial, and increasingly popular among American companies: It tested itself. The company conducted a voluntary self-audit of its operations to see whether they complied with state environmental standards. It discovered that they didn't -- regulators had underestimated the brewery's VOC emissions by a factor of 17 -- and promptly reported its infraction to state environmental authorities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a reward for playing the good corporate citizen and turning itself in, Coors was slapped with a record $1-million fine by the Colorado Department of Health. The company protested the fine, arguing that a million bucks was too much to pay for alerting the state to pollution that neither party had known was occurring. The state legislature and Democratic governor Roy Romer agreed, and in 1994 Colorado became the second state in the nation to pass a law to protect the results of self-audits from being used against companies that voluntarily disclose and correct their environmental infractions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To date, 19 states have passed audit laws -- all of them since 1993 -- and 25 more are considering them. But this surging tide of state innovation is lapping up against a formidable seawall of entrenched federal bureaucratic interests. Officials at the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) and the Justice Department have long been hostile to self-audit laws, and that hostility has recently turned to active sabotage. States that have passed these laws -- as well as those merely considering them -- are being bluntly told that they do so at the risk of losing autonomy over their own environmental programs. Do it our way, the EPA has warned, or don't do it at all. Democratic and Republican state officials recognize this tactic for what it is: blackmail. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the age of reinvented government, rulemaking by the EPA has increased by 20 percent since 1992. Wayne Crews of the <a href="http://www.cei.org/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a> estimates the cost of environmental regulation at $174 billion this year, a whopping 26 percent of the total regulatory burden on American families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Self-audits help businesses cut through complex regulations administered by multiple layers of bureaucracy by providing them with a detailed breakdown of their operations, including suspected sources of pollution. As long as these reports remain in-house, they are useful tools that result in greater environmental compliance. But for bureaucrats used to measuring results in terms of the fines and sentences they impose, audit reports are an irresistible temptation to regulate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In some instances, as with Coors, state or federal regulators subpoena the audit reports themselves. In others, third parties -- typically environmental groups -- use these reports as the basis for class-action lawsuits. As a result, many companies are understandably reluctant to perform a self-audit.States are attempting to overcome this reluctance by providing businesses with assurances that their good deeds will not be used against them. Most state laws protect, or "privilege," audit reports from use against the company in a lawsuit. Many also provide limited immunity from prosecution to companies that promptly report and correct any violations they uncover. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States love self-auditing because it allows them to replace the old command-and-control regulatory model with one that allows private-sector innovation. Audits are part of a new thinking about regulation that prizes a cooperative private industry over a reactive regulatory bureaucracy, and environmental compliance over punishment. Whereas the old model relied on legions of enviro-cops to enforce the law, the new model does what even the most zealous and well-staffed bureaucracy cannot: detect operational problems before they become environmental hazards.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But for all the same reasons the states love self-auditing, it seems, the feds hate it. Although it cannot cite one case in which an audit-protection law was abused, the EPA has decided that states with audit laws are guilty until proven innocent. Without the benign supervision of our federal regulators, EPA officials tell state governors, you will willfully and intentionally foul your own nests. When New Hampshire was considering an audit law last year, John DeVillars, the chief EPA administrator for that region, warned Governor Steve Merrill that the law might tempt him to relax environmental enforcement and turn his state into a "pollution haven" in order to attract business. Merrill replied that he was offended by the suggestion that he would jeopardize the health of his citizens by ignoring criminal behavior -- and he signed the law.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	When artful persuasion failed to sway the states, federal bureaucrats resorted to a blunter instrument: their power to delegate to -- or withhold from -- the states the authority over environmental programs under the major federal laws. In March 1995, EPA Administrator Carol Browner warned that the passage of state audit laws "would cause environmental programs delegated to states . . . to revert to national control at EPA." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For the 50 states, this was no small matter. Although most major federal environmental statutes allow the states to administer and enforce programs, EPA officials have the ultimate say in when and how that authority is granted. They have not been shy about using it. States that are considering audit laws such as Ohio, Arizona, Florida, and California have received what one official dubbed "nastygrams" from the EPA. Earlier this year, for instance, Arizona was warned in the bluntest terms that passage of its audit law would lead to a denial of the state's authority to run the Clean Air Act permit program. Other states that have audit laws and would also like to be able to issue permits to businesses under the Clean Air Act -- including Texas, Idaho, and Michigan--have been denied that authority by the EPA. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In some states, this "delegation blackmail" approach seems to be working. Audit bills died in the Ohio, Maryland, and California legislatures this year following heavy lobbying by the EPA and environmental groups. Texas state senator Warren Chisum, who sponsored the Texas law as a Democrat but became a Republican this year, said "the EPA threats have certainly played a role in delaying this in other states. Legislators might say these bills are a good deal, but they are not worth bringing down the wrath of the EPA upon the state." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Still, some state officials refused to be cowed. "I think scare tactics in swing districts in an election year can be effective, but I didn't poll anyone," says Arizona state representative Russell Bowers. "It always disturbs me when state law is dictated to us by the feds. But the bill will be back next year."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For others, the Clinton administration's heavy-handed tactics have only increased their resolve. Russell Harding, the director of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality, has been a leader in organizing states with audit laws to resist federal pressure. Harding has dug in his heels in Lansing every bit as deep as Carol Browner's pumps pierce the terra in Washington, D.C. -- maybe deeper. "We think we have a very balanced, very carefully crafted law," he says. "Our intention is not to change it. If push comes to shove, we'll give them their programs back."

<b>Funds for New Leadership</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Since 1993, the William H. Donner Foundation, of New York, has granted "New Leadership" fellowships to recognize individuals or groups whose grass-roots efforts to better their communities exemplify the principles of the foundation's "human capital" program. These include self-reliance, entrepreneurialism, personal responsibility, and volunteerism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	This year's winners of the fellowships include: the Reverend Ronald Matlack, of Camden, New Jersey, who established a church on the model of a foreign mission to relieve blight in an urban neighborhood; Carl Elkins, the founder of the Homeless Literacy Project, in New York City; James Robinson, who started a volunteer ambulance corps for youth in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of New York; Terrence Tighe, the founder of an "employability program" that teaches workplace skills and demeanor to K-8 students at an urban Omaha Catholic school; and David Green, the executive director of a network of education services known as the David School for poor families and at-risk youth in Eastern Kentucky. The awards usually amount to $60,000 over three years.

<p>
<b>Report Card on Devolution</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Urban Institute and the Annie E. Casey Foundation have launched an ambitious $20-million project to evaluate the effects of devolution -- or the "New Federalism" -- on social services and communities. The multi-year project aims to answer three major questions about the federal government's efforts to devolve many responsibilities to states and municipalities: (1) How will the New Federalism affect state and local budgets? (2) How will it affect state policy priorities and the delivery of services? (3) How will it affect the behavior and well-being of individuals and families? Researchers at the Urban Institute will track the course of devolutionary policies from legislative bodies all the way down to neighborhoods, and analyze their effects according to a number of statistical indicators of social well-being. These indicators include "health status" (e.g. rates of low-birth-weight births and childhood immunization); "child and youth well-being" (child abuse and neglect, teen pregnancies, and teen deaths, for example); "family well-being" (the number of out-of-wedlock births and children in foster care, to name a few); and "economic security" (for example, poverty levels, number of families receiving public assistance, employment rates, and income growth).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The project may not issue a comprehensive report for at least three years, but will release periodic policy briefs and interim reports.

Science Skills, a high school whose students come from some of New York's most impoverished neighborhoods, was started by Johnson with the help of New Visions for Public Schools, a Manhattan-based organization that works with the Board of Education and the private sector to promote school reform. Johnson, a 45-year-old African American, graduated from Empire State College with a degree in science education. Like many educators involved in the effort to reform New York's public schools, he believes that poor children are being shortchanged by the system. Unlike most "progressive" educators, however, Johnson is convinced that the way to help poor minority students is not by loosening standards, but by tightening them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a result, Science Skills Center is focused on preparing students to do well on standardized tests, including the New York State Regents exams and the Scholastic Aptitude Tests. At a time when only 20 percent of New York's public-school students receive a Regents diploma, all of Johnson's students -- even those designated as special-education students -- take, and pass, the Regents exam.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Not surprisingly, this has made Science Skills Center extremely popular with New York's parents, many of whose children have to be turned away simply because the school does not have enough space for all the applicants. But "progressive" educators are horrified by Johnson's emphasis on tests, his autocratic style, and his rigorous, back-to-basics curriculum. They think that schools should prepare students for the world as it already exists. "Parents at my school have some very fundamental questions," he observes. "Can my kid read? Can my kid add the grocery bill? Can my kid go to college? Some of my colleagues want to duck those questions and say, 'They're not important.' But we can't just say that we don't believe in measuring our kids against kids in other parts of the city or state, because colleges are making decisions based on those comparisons. . . . Harvard it still looking at scores, so that's what I'm going with."

<b>A Classical Curriculum</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Gene Edward Veith, dean of arts and sciences at Concordia University, in Wisconsin, writes that too many  proposals to reform America's schools focus on means -- vouchers, technology, teacher certification -- rather than on ends. Although he does not disparage these means, what American education most urgently requires, Veith contends, is a new philosophy of education -- a return to the classical conception of education as the knowledge a person requires to be truly free, and to the classical "trivium" of grammar, logic, and rhetoric. "To be educated in any discipline," he writes, "one must know its basic facts (grammar); be able to think deeply about the subject (logic); and be able to act on that knowledge in a personal, original and independent way (rhetoric)."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Veith cites three examples of how the classical approach to education is being used in primary and secondary schools. The Association of Classical and Christian Schools (ACCS), which currently has 26 member schools, was founded in 1993 by the Reverend Douglas Wilson, a Protestant minister from Idaho, to promote the idea of a Christian education organized around the trivium. In the prototype ACCS school, the Logos School (founded by Wilson in 1980), the primary grades are devoted to acquiring basic knowledge -- reading, arithmetic, patriotic and biblical stories. Middle school and junior high are devoted to "the questioning and probing of reality that is logic."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Finally, the high-school years, ages 15 to 18, are devoted to self-expression, and beginning rhetoric classes use textbooks by Aristotle and Cicero. According to Veith, "The level of discourse, the depth of thinking, and what can only be described as a richness of character set the Logos seniors apart. Such are the benefits of a classical education."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other attempts to construct an educational philosophy around the classical trivium are the Paideia Project -- used today in some 30 school districts nationwide -- and the Westside Preparatory School in Chicago. These schools help broaden the horizons of thousands of children, including poor children often written off as ineducable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The classical approach to education is valuable, Veith contends, because it offers a "comprehensive, universal paradigm for learning." In his view, the classical education movement holds the key not only to educational reform but to an educational renaissance in America.

<b>Private Schools and Special Ed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In <i>Meeting the Challenge</i>, Janet R. Beales, who directs the Reason Foundation's Study Program, points out that, contrary to a widely held myth, public schools do not accept every student. Students that public schools believe they cannot educate are often sent, at public expense, to private schools that specialize in the education of a certain type of student.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beales distinguishes between three broad categories of difficult-to-educate students who are served by the private sector: "special-education" students are those with mental, physical, emotional, or disabilities. Over 100,000 students, or about 2 percent of the nation's special-education population, currently attend nonpublic schools at the public's expense. (Typically, the private school will operate under contract with government agencies at the local, state, or even federal level).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"At-risk students" include dropouts, teen parents, homeless youth and students with drug problems. School districts in at least 17 states contract with private schools to educate these students. Charter schools -- autonomous, publicly funded schools freed from most state and local regulations -- play an especially large role in serving these students.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Adjudicated students" are juvenile criminals who, under compulsory state education laws, are required to attend school until a certain age. About 35,000 adjudicated youth are housed in 2,000 privately operated facilities, including training centers, ranches, shelters, halfway houses and group homes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although meaningful comparisons between education outcomes for difficult-to-educate students in public and private schools are currently impossible, given the lack of reliable data, Beales documents the wide variety of learning environments provided by the private sector to deal with such students. These arrangements include residential schools, day schools, charter schools, independent study programs, religious schools, and home schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Given this wide variety of options, Beales contends, the commonly heard argument that school-choice policies would turn public schools into a "dumping ground" for the most difficult-to-educate students is simply not credible. On the contrary, a large-scale school-choice program would benefit these students by providing them with a "supply of schools as diverse as the students they are intended to serve." The fact that, even now, private schools already serve many students with special needs, sometimes enrolling the most difficult among them, "lays bare the myth of the public-school dumping ground."

<h2>Cautionary Tales</h2>

<b>Public Schools and Special Ed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although the cost of educating a child in New York City's public-school system comes to $8,000 per year, that figure, argues Kay S. Hymowitz in her profile of New York City's "special-ed" schools, is actually quite misleading. A full-time special-ed student costs the city $23,598 per year. A part-time special-ed student costs $10,207 per year. But an ordinary student receives only $5,148 in educational services per year. New York's "regular education system," Hymowitz argues, "resembles a parking lot full of 1968 cars, while special ed is like a handful of shiny new Cadillacs."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All this might not be so bad if special-ed classes were actually helping their students. But two-thirds of special-ed students exiting the system in 1995, Hymowitz writes, dropped out instead of graduating. Of the remaining third, only half received a diploma that was worth anything.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	New York's special-ed system is a monument to good intentions gone awry. In 1975, Congress passed the All Handicapped Children Act, later called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Initially, the law called on the federal government to pay 40 percent of the cost of the vast program it had called into being. In fact, today Washington funds a mere 7 percent of the program, leaving New York taxpayers to pay the rest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The law was based on several assumptions: First, that if a team of experts examined a child, it could evaluate his or her problem with scientific precision; second, that this team of experts, drawing on the latest scientific advances, could devise an effective program to treat the problem; and third, that educators could then successfully implement such a program, no matter what the cost. In fact, Hymowitz points out, the initial assumption was completely wrong: Different teams of experts, evaluating the same child, have issued sharply different diagnoses. And if assumption one is flawed, it follows that the others are unworkable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, more than 60 percent of the children assigned to special-ed programs are classified as "learning disabled," a term so vague and expansive, writes Hymowitz, "that it is a standing invitation to any poorly performing child." Hymowitz believes that a substantial number of "learning disabled" children come from chaotic, problem-ridden families; their deprivation is cultural, not neurological. Yet the law governing special ed specifies that the category "learning disabled" should "not include children who have learning problems which are primarily the result of . . . environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage." In other words, many of the students enrolled in expensive special-ed programs have no right to be there.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But there are powerful political forces blocking reform. Special-ed schools have provided jobs for thousands of psychologists, social workers, and evaluators. As a result, the unions are quite satisfied with the status quo. Parents of handicapped children also seem pleased with New York's special-ed program, and politicians, fearful of being accused of a lack of compassion, are unwilling to antagonize these parents. As a result, a special-education system that costs a great deal, accomplishes very little, and starves regular public schools of badly needed funds appears impervious to reform.

<h2>Thoughts on Civil Society</h2>

<b>Crime's Terrible Toll</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In <i>Body Count</i>, former Secretary of Education <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William J. Bennett</a> and his two co-authors, Princeton criminologist John DiIulio and John P. Walters, the former deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, focus on what they call "superpredators," cruel, cold-blooded, shockingly young men who can and do kill at random, without rhyme, reason, or remorse, and without any fear of retribution. Over the next decade, they predict, the number of such superpredators is bound to increase substantially, leading to an unprecedented crime wave. "America is a ticking crime bomb," they declare, and when it explodes our streets will be inundated with young killers, possibly leading to an "authoritarian backlash" that will undermine our free institutions and bring us "only a short step away from achieving a quasi-police state."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The root cause of predatory street crime, the authors contend, is moral poverty. "By 'moral poverty'," they write, "we mean the poverty of being without loving, capable, responsible adults who teach the young right from wrong. . . . In the extreme, it is the poverty of growing up surrounded by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults in a perfectly criminogenic environment -- that is, an environment that seems almost consciously designed to produce vicious, unrepentant, predatory street criminals."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Among the causes of moral poverty, Bennett and his co-authors cite the cultural revolution of the 1960s that undermined traditional values and institutions and a welfare system that subsidized illegitimacy and subverts the work ethic. But they pay particular attention to drugs, which, they argue, cause moral poverty by dissolving "the bonds of human and familial ties." By making drug-addicted parents indifferent to everything, including the well-being of their children, drugs sever family members not only from one another, but also from the traditional values of the larger society. Growing up in such families is like being raised by a pack of wolves, and those who survive the ordeal are likely to lack certain character traits -- such as empathy and impulse control -- that we think of quintessentially human.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	From this it follows that if we are serious about eradicating moral poverty, we must conduct an uncompromising war against drugs. The authors of <i>Body Count</i> argue that, contrary to widely-held misconception, America's war on drugs was yielding impressive results until the Clinton administration came into office. Since Clinton's election, however, "the nation has suffered the greatest increase in drug use and the largest expansion in the supply of illegal drugs ever measured." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Besides waging the war on drugs with renewed vigor, eradicating moral poverty requires that we reform our schools and our systems for criminal justice, welfare, and adoption. Most importantly, however, promoting traditional values among young members of the underclass requires the "re-moralization" of our culture through "a widespread renewal of religious faith and the strengthening of religious institutions."

<h2>A City's Assault on Teen Pregnancy</h2>
<b>By Joe Loconte</b>
<P></center>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Eve Jackson taught "family life" classes to students in Hamilton Southeastern High School, a typical Indianapolis-area public school, for four years. They were troubling years for her Baptist conscience.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At the exact time when the hormones of adolescents are at flood tide, Jackson says, the most persuasive message they get about sex comes from their peers -- and the message is: "Come on in, the water's fine." Other voices remain muffled. Teachers often ignore or play down a state requirement that they stress abstinence in sex-education classes. Church-state legal doctrine bans religious ideas about premarital sex from public schools. Says Jackson, "As much as I wanted to talk about God, I really couldn't."

</table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And what she could talk about -- responsible decision-making, peer pressure, self-esteem -- had no more effect than a flashing yellow light on a lonely country road. "So many of them were sexually active. Every year I had a couple of students who had abortions," she says. "But I couldn't talk them out of being sexually involved." Jackson eventually left public education, developed a Bible-based abstinence program taught by high-school juniors and seniors, and brought it into 34 Catholic grade schools throughout the city.



<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now the public schools -- in a city with a teen pregnancy rate that has risen 40 percent over the last decade -- want Jackson back. Mayor Steve Goldsmith has asked Jackson to bring her chastity program, "A Promise to Keep," into 150 public grade schools this fall. Stripped of its religious references, the program will recruit at least 100 high-school students to serve as advocates for abstinence. It's one of more than two dozen initiatives launched by the mayor in the last year, using his bully pulpit in an effort to reduce out-of-wedlock births. Citing its impact on crime, poverty, and welfare dependence, Goldsmith calls teen pregnancy "the most serious long-term issue facing this city. We can do nothing if we don't solve this problem."<p><b>Energize and Stigmatize</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unlike President Clinton's $30-million proposal to reduce illegitimacy, however, the mayor of the nation's 12th-largest city seems uninterested in expanding government services. Following a meeting last year that included the city's school superintendent, a juvenile-court judge, and a county health director, Goldsmith mapped out a 27-point strategy for city-wide action. His aim: energize public opinion, the courts, and church and community groups to stigmatize out-of-wedlock births while supporting teen mothers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The mayor intends to treat casual attitudes about teen pregnancy with the same tolerance that actor Jean-Claude Van Damme brings to flabbiness: Since studies show that roughly half of all teenage moms are impregnated by males older than 18, Goldsmith wants prosecutors to crack down on statutory rape. He plans to enforce laws requiring women to establish paternity as a condition of receiving welfare. He intends to publish monthly reports of teen pregnancies in every high school in the city.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And while local Planned Parenthood clinics seek to build "creative self-expression" through dance, art, and painting classes, Goldsmith is pressuring schools to ban pregnant teens and boys who have fathered children from extracurricular activities. He even has floated the idea of sending pregnant girls to separate schools altogether.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Philosophically we're not in agreement," says Kathleen Baldwin, Planned Parenthood's director of education in Indianapolis. "They would define the problem largely as illegitimacy, and we would define it as limited opportunities for achievement."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Esperanza Zendejas, the superintendent of Indianapolis's public schools, opposes some of the mayor's school-based sanctions, but applauds his broad-based approach to attacking the problem of illegitimacy. "The fact that the city, as a city, is looking at teen pregnancy is extraordinary," she says. "It should be happening in every city in the nation."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It wouldn't be happening in Indianapolis without the active support of the religious community, Goldsmith says. Indeed, the mayor insists that the most dynamic partner in the assault on the culture of teen pregnancy -- and all of the social problems it creates -- will be churches and synagogues. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In February, he summoned 100 spiritual leaders -- Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist -- to a summit on teen pregnancy. He asked them to speak out on the risks of sexual activity outside of marriage. More significantly, he challenged congregations to become personally involved with families on welfare by helping women to avoid more pregnancies, reunite with the father of their children, and get off of government assistance. "The whole notion is to be more of a mentor and support group, not a candy store," says Richard Wiehe, the executive director of the Faith and Families project, a new effort to link congregations with welfare families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The mayor wants religious groups to fight this culture war almost everywhere -- even in city parks. Indianapolis now has 16 congregations managing 30 contracts to maintain public parks. In exchange, churches can sponsor events in the parks with minimal bureaucratic hassle. Goldsmith's explicit hope is that people of faith will form relationships with children who live in surrounding neighborhoods. "We could put police officers on every corner of the city," he says, "but if our people did not believe in God and basic moral values, then we would still not have a safe community."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Crime statistics seem to side with the mayor: Juvenile crime in Indianapolis has increased nearly tenfold in the last decade, and 75 percent of those offenses were committed by fatherless children. Judge Jim Payne of the juvenile court of Marion County says at least 600 new juveniles enter the system each month. "Out-of-wedlock birth is driving every single rotten outcome in our city," says Krista Rush, Mayor's Goldsmith's social-policy advisor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At Goldsmith's request, the Indianapolis Training Center (ITC) set up shop in the city a few years ago to reach out to troubled youth and their families. Payne now refers kids headed for state detention centers to the Christian-based program, which houses about two dozen teens at a time in its residential center. To overcome objections by the Indiana Civil Liberties Union, Payne argued that the program's emphasis on character and family relationships could help reverse irresponsible or predatory attitudes toward sex that have become "incredibly common" among today's youth.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Center director Benny McWha says that many of the girls at the center were sexually abused as children, and are considered at high risk of teen pregnancy. Most of the boys come with no experience of responsible fatherhood. Eight mentor families and about a hundred student volunteers work to keep the kids out of trouble.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Our primary goal is to help teach them character," McWha says, which includes "moral purity from a biblical perspective." The ITC staff also offers practical support -- and a message of abstinence -- to unmarried mothers in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods.<p><b>Modeling the Message</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Communicating an effective abstinence message may be the most difficult task facing the mayor, and the city's public schools are becoming a prime battleground. It is here where getting involved sexually is considered a badge of honor. And it is here where more and more pregnant teens are envied, admired, and applauded -- but rarely shunned. "In many of our schools," Rush says, "there's a tremendous reward for getting pregnant."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jackson, who coordinates adolescent-growth programs for the Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis, cites three principles for overturning an ethos of sexual freedom: (1) Give kids a clear message of abstinence until marriage, (2) get the message to them early, and (3) recruit credible high-school students to deliver it.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"There's a real need to have some positive peer pressure for a change," Jackson says. Young people are more likely to listen when student role models get involved. And, contrary to Planned Parenthood's news releases, finding chaste high schoolers is not a problem. Last year, Jackson recruited 200 peer mentors from six Catholic schools and six public schools to lead the workshops. She expects to train at least 50 students from Indianapolis high schools to work with kids in the city's middle schools this fall.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Though Jackson has removed all religious references from her public-school program, the six-hour curriculum parallels its religious counterpart in stressing chastity until marriage. Jackson essentially has translated religious concepts about the benefits of marriage -- and the risks of sexual permissiveness -- into secular language.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, most of Jackson's high-school mentors come from strong religious backgrounds. "We're finding that our peer mentors are people of faith," she says. "That faith component is essential, because it gives them a moral standard to live by. Otherwise, it's anything goes."

<b>Statement of Purpose</b><br>
<hr></center>
<p>
	Our mission is to revive the spirit of American citizenship by recovering the core political principles of our Founding Fathers and by articulating and advancing the conservative vision of civil society.<p>
	<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> illuminates the families, communities, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, business enterprises, public and private schools, and local governments that are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized, bureaucratic government. Our goal is to stimulate the citizenship movement -- chronicling its success stories, exposing its obstacles and opportunities, and debating the policies that will best invigorate civil society.
<p>	American citizenship combines freedom with responsibility. These are the two great themes of modern conservatism, and they build on the best of the American tradition. Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. Americans are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the political principles of the United States: the Constitution, the rule of law, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
<P>	Americans are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our own families, to participate actively in civic life, to help our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of others' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.       <P><center><hr width=30%></center>
<P>	<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> is published by <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, a research and educational institute that formulates and promotes conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.<P><center><bq>					"Without local institutions, a nation					may give itself a free government,					but it does not have the spirit of liberty."	<br>					Alexis de Tocqueville, <i>Democracy in America</i></bq></center>

<title>How States Can Fight Violent Crime: Two Dozen Steps to a Safer America -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<img src="/heritage/header.gif">
<h3> HOW STATES CAN FIGHT VIOLENT CRIME: TWO DOZEN STEPS TO A SAFER AMERICA </h3>

By Mary Kate Cary<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No.  944/S<br>
June 7, 1993<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>

<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>

     Violent crime remains at intolerably high levels. Gang violence
is spreading across the country. And juveniles are committing more and
more serious crimes. At the same time, crime is becoming more ruthless
and wanton. Too many Americans -- especially residents of the inner
cities -- have become prisoners in their homes, behind bars and
chains. It is not surprising, therefore, that the strongest support
for tougher law enforcement is found among inner-city, largely
minority residents. (See Robert Rector, "A Comprehensive Urban Policy:
How to Fix Welfare and Revitalize America's Inner Cities," Heritage
Foundation Memo to President-Elect Clinton No. 12, January 18, 1993.) 
<P>
     Despite this plague, a powerful bloc of liberal lawmakers in
Congress prevented the passage of tough anti-crime measures proposed
by the Bush Administration. If President Clinton is to launch a war on
crime, he will have to overcome this resistance on Capitol Hill. 
<P>
     As Bill Clinton prepares his own initiatives on crime, he would
be wise to examine the recommendations of the report released last
year by former Attorney General William P. Barr. (For a copy of
Attorney General Barr's original report, "Combatting Violent Crime: 24
Recommendations to Strengthen Criminal Justice" and its "Citizen's
Checklist" of questions for state and local leaders, contact the U.S.
Department of Justice Public Affairs Office at (202) 514-2007.) The
report, entitled "Combatting Violent Crime," focuses on actions which
can be taken at the state and local levels. President Clinton should
call on governors and state legislators to act on the recommendations,
and he should frame federal legislation and policies to complement the
proposals.
<P>
     Real Results. When the federal government works with state
authorities, the combined assault on crime can yield real results.
Working with local police under "Operation Triggerlock," for example,
federal prosecutors were able to charge over 10,000 dangerous
criminals who used firearms in the operation's first eighteen months
alone (Summer 1991-Winter 1992). The average sentence for three-time
felons was eighteen years without parole. In another operation, 300
FBI agents were transferred from counter-espionage to anti-gang squads
in 39 cities across the country, and the federal RICO (Racketeer
Influenced Corrupt Organizations) statutes were used in many cases to
dismember violent gangs. Under the innovative "Operation Weed and
Seed," law enforcement resources were combined with social programs at
the local level to reduce crime in twenty targeted cities. And U.S.
Marshals, in one ten-week period, rounded up thousands of dangerous
fugitives in a massive manhunt named "Operation Gunsmoke."
<P>
     The Clinton Administration should continue to assist state and
local law enforcement officials in these ways. At the same time
President Clinton should build upon the progress made by Presidents
Ronald Reagan and George Bush in strengthening the federal criminal
justice system. During the 1980s, federal legislation reformed bail
laws to establish pretrial detention for dangerous offenders;
sentencing guidelines were initiated to ensure firm and consistent
punishment; mandatory minimum sentences were created and federal
parole was abolished to bring the amount of time served closer to the
amount of time imposed in criminal cases. In addition, substantial
resources were invested in federal law enforcement. The number of
prosecutors and federal law enforcement officials increased
significantly, and President Bush doubled federal prison capacity in
just three years. 
<P>
     Framework for States.Nevertheless, the impact of federal policy
necessarily is limited, since 95 percent of crimes fall within the
jurisdiction of state and local governments. But state and local law
enforcement agencies, with limited resources, are under great strain
to deal effectively with the increase of violence in this country. To
fight violent crime on the state and local levels, Attorney General
Barr made 24 recommendations in his report. Developed in partnership
with a broad array of non-partisan law enforcement officials, these
recommendations are a sound framework for state and local policy
makers seeking tough action on crime. And if the Clinton
Administration should fail to follow through on candidate Clinton's
anti-crime rhetoric, or weaken existing law enforcement programs
through the appointment of liberal jurists to the federal bench, it
will be all the more important for state and local officials to
strengthen law enforcement in their jurisdictions.
<P>
     Already there is evidence that the Clinton Administration is
backing away from tougher law enforcement. President Clinton's first
budget, for instance, substantially cuts resources for the Department
of Justice, and emphasizes social programs at the expense of law
enforcement. The Clinton Administration's budget request for federal
prison construction was $155 million for FY 1994, down from the Bush
Administration's FY 1993 request of $195 million, about a 20 percent
cut. Clinton seeks to reduce prison construction funds to $112 million
by 1998, down from a high of $1.3 billion spent by Bush in 1990 alone.
<P>
     It also appears that the Administration's new crime bill will
reverse many of the legislative reforms enacted during the last
decade, as well as some 22 Supreme Court decisions considered
favorable to law enforcement. It is thus state and local officials who
likely will have to take the lead in the only real opportunity to
improve America's criminal justice system. 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Barr's recommendations focus on five areas: 
<P>
     Protecting the community from dangerous criminals; 
<P>
     Assuring effective deterrence and punishment of adult and young
     offenders; 
<P>
     Creating more efficient trial, appeal, and post-appeal
     procedures; 
<P>
     Improving the detection and prevention of crime; and 
<P>
     Enhancing the role of the victim in the criminal justice process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>   
     Many of the Barr recommendations are modeled after effective
federal statutes enacted during the last decade. President Clinton
should build upon these improvements. And state officials need to take
decisive measures at lower levels of government. Barr's 24
recommendations provide a foundation for such actions.
<P>

<B> THE TIDE OF VIOLENT CRIME IN AMERICA </B>
<P>
     State officials must address a simple fact: The United States is
in the grip of a violent crime wave.
<P>
     As the above graph shows, the number of violent crimes has jumped
dramatically in the last thirty years, over three times the rate in
the 1990s than in 1960. Measuring the increase in terms of population
over the same time period, the U.S. population has increased by 41
percent, while the violent crime rate has increased by more than 500
percent. As Heritage Foundation Distinguished Fellow William J.
Bennett, former National Drug Control Policy Director, observes, "The
rate of violent crime in the U.S. is worse than in any other
industrialized country." (See William J. Bennett, The Index of Leading
Cultural Indicators, published jointly by Empower America, The
Heritage Foundation, and the Free Congress Foundation, Washington D.C.
1993, p. 2.)
<P>
     As noted, the victims of violent crime tend to be
disproportionately poor and members of racial and ethnic minorities,
particularly blacks. "Given current crime rates," observes Bennett,
"eight out of every ten Americans can expect to be a victim of violent
crime at least once in their lives." (Ibid.)

<P>
<B> PROTECTING AMERICA'S COMMUNITIES FROM DANGEROUS CRIMINALS </B>
<P>
     Most of the criminal violence in American society is committed by
a very small group of chronic, violent offenders -- hardened criminals
who commit many violent crimes whenever they are out on the streets.
They begin committing crimes as juveniles, and they go right on
committing crimes as adults, even when on bail, probation, or parole. 
<P>
     The first duty of government is to protect its citizens. If law
enforcement officials are to make any progress in reducing violent
crime, their top priority must be to identify, target, and incarcerate
these hard-core, chronic offenders.
<P>
     The Barr report indicates ways in which state legislatures can
take decisive action to protect citizens:
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #1: Give judges legal authority for pretrial detention
     of dangerous defendants.
<P>
     Every state should grant statutory, and if necessary, state
constitutional authority to its trial judges to hold, without bail,
those defendants who are a danger to witnesses, victims, or the
community at large -- both before trial and pending appeal. 
<P>
     A study by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) of individuals on pretrial release in 75 of the
nation's most populous counties found that 18 percent of released
defendants were known to have been rearrested for the commission of a
felony while on pretrial release. Two-thirds of those rearrested while
on release were again released. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics,
U.S. Department of Justice, Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants,
1988 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991), p. 1.
See also Lazar Institute, "Pretrial Release: A National Evaluation of
Practices and Outcomes," prepared for the National Institute of
Justice, U.S. Department of Justice, by Mary A. Toborg (October 1981),
Grant No. 71-NI-AX-0038, p. 48 (reporting similar rates of pretrial
rearrest).)
<P>
     This revolving door justice adds significantly to crime and
destroys public confidence in the criminal justice system. Law-abiding
citizens understandably are reluctant to inform police of criminal
activities when they know that those arrested will be back on the
street in a few days, or even in a few hours. Citizens fear
retaliation, intimidation, and harassment by returning criminals if
they help police. 
<P>
     Potent Tool. At the federal level, the Bail Reform Act of 1984
grants federal judges the authority to deny bail or pretrial release
to defendants who pose a danger to specific individuals or to the
community in general. (18 U.S.C. sec. 3141-56.) Under the Act,
criminal defendants with serious records, including the commission of
crimes while on release and those charged with serious drug felonies,
are presumed to be a danger to the community and therefore unsuitable
for release. The Act also creates a strong presumption that a
convicted offender will remain imprisoned during any post-conviction
appeal.
<P>
     Pretrial detention has helped federal prosecutors cripple
organized crime and drug rings. When pretrial detention is foregone,
defendants have the opportunity to intimidate or harm witnesses before
their trials. But when pretrial detention is enforced, dangerous
defendants are put behind bars until trial, where they are unable to
obstruct justice or pose a threat. Pretrial detention also increases
the protection afforded to witnesses and victims of crimes.
<P>
     Despite the proven effectiveness of the federal statute, and its
soundness as federal constitutional law, (The Supreme Court rejected a
constitutional challenge to the pretrial detention provisions of the
Bail Reform Act in United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987).)
only a few states have effective pretrial detention provisions. In
many states, pretrial detention is not currently possible because of
an absolute right to bail in the state constitution. Thus where state
constitutional reform is necessary to remedy this, it should be
enacted. 
<P>
     States also should consider other key provisions of the Bail
Reform Act of 1984, such as the serious penalties for jumping bail and
enhanced penalties for crimes committed while on release.
<P>
     In Philadelphia in 1986, for example, a judge placed a limit on
the number of criminals that could be housed in the Philadelphia jail,
in order to prevent overcrowding. Released because of this order were
dangerous arrestees who otherwise would be held without bail or on
very high bond. The result was an increase in violent crimes committed
by the releasees. In the face of this crisis, the federal government
stepped in to use federal pretrial detention in cooperation with state
authorities. Over 600 gang members, who would have been turned loose
by state judges because there was no room to hold them, were placed in
federal facilities under federal law while awaiting trial. The
homicide rate in Philadelphia declined as a result. (See Mike Baylson
(U.S. Attorney ED-PA) and Willie Williams (Philadelphia Police
Commissioner), "Here's Why Murders are Down in the City," The
Philadelphia Inquirer, January 15, 1992, p. A13.)
<P>

<B> PUNISHING AND DETERRING VIOLENT CRIMINALS </B>
<P>
     Imprisoning the hard-core population of chronic, violent
offenders will reduce the level of violent crime in America. The
reason: When these criminals are on the streets, they are victimizing
citizens; when they are in prison, they are not committing crimes
against the public. While liberals may question the deterrent and
rehabilitative aspects of imprisonment, one thing is beyond debate:
Prison incapacitates chronic, repeat offenders.
<P>
     Consider the American experience of the last three decades. In
the 1960s and early 1970s, incarceration rates dropped and violent
crime rates skyrocketed. Conversely, when incarceration rates jumped
in the 1980s, the rate of increase of crime was substantially reduced.
(See Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice,
Crime in the United States, Uniform Crime Reports 1959-90 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, various years); Bureau of
Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Historical Statistics
on Prisoners in State and Federal Institutions, Year end 1925-86
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1988) and
Prisoners in 1989 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1990).) This is all the more impressive, considering the mid-1980s
"crack" drug epidemic and its associated violence.
<P>
     The best way to reduce crime is to identify, prosecute, and
incarcerate hard-core criminals. Study after study shows that a
relatively small portion of the population is responsible for the
lion's share of criminal violence in this country. For example, one
California study found that 3.8 percent of a group of more than
236,000 men born in 1956 were responsible for 55.5 percent of all
serious felonies committed by the study group. (These numbers are
derived from Robert Tillman, "Prevalence and Incidence of Arrest among
Adult Males in California," prepared for California Department of
Justice, Bureau of Criminal Statistics and Special Services,
Sacramento, California (1987).)
<P>
     Putting chronic offenders in prison for long periods, especially
upon second and third convictions, is the most effective way to reduce
violent crime.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #2: Restrict parole and increase the time actually
     served by violent offenders.
<P>
     An axiom of effective law enforcement is that punishment should
be swift, certain, and severe. Yet in too many jurisdictions, it is
none of these. In fact, most violent offenders who are sent to state
prison serve only a small fraction of their sentences. According to
the Bureau of Justice Statistics, analysis of release practices in 36
states and the District of Columbia in 1988 shows that although
violent offenders received an average sentence of seven years and
eleven months imprisonment, they served an average of only two years
and eleven months in prison -- or 37 percent of their imposed
sentence. Overall, 51 percent of the violent offenders in the survey
were discharged from prison in two years or less, and 76 percent were
out in four years or less. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S.
Department of Justice, National Corrections Reporting Program, 1988
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1992), tables 2-7
and 2-4.) 
<P>
     The adjacent chart shows the median sentence and time served in
prison for those released for the first time on a sentence in 1988.
(Ibid.)
<P>
     This huge gap between the nominal sentence given and the real
time served is dishonest, and it is bad policy. It is dishonest
because the public -- especially victims of crime -- is often under
the impression that the sentence will be served in full, when in fact
no such thing happens. It is bad policy because it puts the public at
risk. 
<P>
     There are several reasons why states should restrict parole
practices. First, parole is based on the mistaken idea that the
primary reason for incarceration is rehabilitation (prisoners can be
released as soon as they are rehabilitated, so the argument goes), and
ignores the deterrent, incapacitative, and retributive reasons for
imprisonment. A clear and truthful sentence increases the certainty of
punishment, and both its deterrent and incapacitative effects. 
<P>
     Second, in too many cases parole simply does not work. Studies of
the continuing failure of parole obscure the terrible human cost to
law-abiding citizens. (See, for example, Mark Vosburgh and Sean
Holton, "Florida Prison Failure Churns Out Crime Before Its Time,"
Orlando Sentinal, August 13, 1989, p. A-12; Mark Vosburgh, "Florida's
Early Releases: Flood of Rearrests May Sink Crowded Prisons," Orlando
Sentinal, December 17, 1989, p. A-1; U.S. Department of Justice,

U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism
of Young Parolees, May 1987 (NCJ-104916).) For example, Suzanne
Harrison, an eighteen-year-old honor student, three weeks from
graduation, left her home in Texas with two friends, nineteen and
twenty years old, on May 4, 1986. Her body was found the next day. She
had been raped, beaten, and strangled. Her two companions were shot to
death, and their bodies were found ten days later in a ditch. 
<P>
     Their killer, Jerry Walter McFadden (who calls himself "Animal"),
had been convicted previously of two 1973 rapes, and sentenced to two
fifteen-year sentences in the Texas Penitentiary. Paroled in 1978, he
was again sentenced to fifteen years in 1981 for a crime spree in
which he kidnapped, raped, and sodomized a Texas woman. Despite the
fact that his record now contained three sex-related convictions and
two prison terms, he was released again on parole in July 1985.
McFadden's crime spree finally came to an end when he was convicted of
the capital murder of Suzanne Harrison and sentenced to death in 1987.
McFadden raped and killed Harrison and killed her two friends less
than a year after being released on parole. This tragic example is all
too common, and the cost of failed parole practices to the public
safety is all too high. 
<P>
     Parole sometimes is used as an answer to prison overcrowding.
This is hardly a reasonable justification for the premature release of
violent criminals into the community. The answer to a lack of prison
space is to build more prisons, not to release dangerous criminals.
<P>
     Until recently, the Texas prison system was not expanding rapidly
enough to house that state's criminals. Under federal court order to
remain at a maximum of 95 percent of capacity, the Texas prison system
responded by increasing the number of inmates released on parole. The
number of felons on parole increased by 430 percent during the 1980s,
(See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice,
Probation and Parole 1981 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1982), p. 2; Probation and Parole 1989 (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Government Printing Office, 1990), table 1.) and inmates served an
average of only 62 days for each year of their sentence. (See Texas
Department of Corrections, 1991 Fiscal Year Statistical Report,
Summary Table 4 (1992).) As a result, reported crime rates in Texas
increased 29 percent in the 1980s, according to the FBI, while they
fell for the nation as a whole. (See Federal Bureau of Investigation,
U.S. Department of Justice, Crime in the United States, Uniform Crime
Reports, 1980, table 3 (1981) and 1989, table 5 (1990).)
<P>
     States should enact "truth in sentencing." Parole should be
restricted so that the sentence served more closely matches the
sentence imposed. While "good behavior" incentives may be used to
control prisoners, the mechanism should not exceed federal standards
requiring 85 percent of sentence to be served.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #3: Enact mandatory minimum sentences for gun
     offenders, armed career criminals, and repeat violent offenders.
<P>
     In many states, sentences for violent crimes are too short. To
many criminals, jail time is little more than a brief cost of doing
business. For example, in 1988, of an estimated 100,000 persons
convicted in state courts of murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated
assault, some 17 percent -- or about 17,000 violent criminals --
received sentences that included no prison time at all. (See Bureau of
Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Felony Sentences in
State Courts, 1988 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1990), p. 2.)
<P>
     State legislators should enact mandatory minimum sentences for
aggravated crimes of violence, and for such crimes committed by repeat
offenders. Every state should follow the example of federal law, which
mandates imprisonment where a firearm is used or possessed in the
commission of certain serious felonies. (18 U.S.C. sec. 924 (c) (1).) 
<P>
     Every state should also enact laws similar to the federal armed
career criminal statute, which targets repeat violent criminals who
possess a gun. (18 U.S.C. sec 924 (e).) Under federal law, any person
who has been convicted of three violent felonies or serious drug
offenses, and who illegally possesses a firearm, is sentenced to at
least fifteen years imprisonment without possibility of parole. There
are graduated, lesser penalties for those who have been convicted of
one or more prior felonies and illegally possess a gun. 
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #4: Build more prisons.
<P>
     As former Attorney General Barr says: "The choice is clear: More
prisons or more crime." Building more prisons is not only the morally
right thing to do, it is also economically the right thing to do. As
Heritage Foundation scholar Robert Rector argues, crime is a high tax
on the economic life of America's cities. (Rector, op. cit.) The cost
to society of releasing violent criminals prematurely is far higher
than the cost of building and operating prisons. When a violent
offender is released after conviction because of insufficient prison
space, all the money used to apprehend, try, and convict the criminal
is wasted. And although incarcerating criminals is not cheap, the cost
of not incarcerating criminals is far more expensive.
<P>
     The overall cost of crime to victims -- including direct losses,
pain and suffering, and risk of death -- has been estimated in the
billions of dollars. (See Mark A. Cohen, "Pain, Suffering and Jury
Awards: A Study of the Cost of Crime to Victims," Law and Society
Review, Vol. 22 (1988), p. 539. Cohen estimated the 1984 aggregate
cost of crime to victims at $92.6 billion in 1985 dollars.) And this
does not include larger costs of crime to society, such as lost sales,
because people are afraid to go out shopping; lost jobs, when
businesses leave crime-ridden neighborhoods; and lost tax revenues,
when sales, businesses, and jobs no longer exist.
<P>
     A study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of a group
of career criminals found each had committed an average of 160 crimes
a year. (See Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, U.S. Department
of the Treasury, Protecting America: The Effectiveness of the Federal
Armed Career Criminal Statute (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government
Printing Office, 1992), p. 29; see also Jan M. Chaiken and Marcia R.
Chaiken, Varieties of Criminal Behavior, prepared for the National
Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice (Rand Corp., 1982),
p. 215.) A 1987 National Institute of Justice study estimated that the
average societal cost per crime in the nation was slightly more than
$2,300. (See National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of
Justice, Making Confinement Decisions (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Government Printing Office, 1987), p. 4.) When these costs are
compounded with the multiple crimes committed by the chronic offenders
mentioned above, the cost to society of not incarcerating each
criminal could exceed $350,000 per year.
<P>
     Despite the huge costs of not incarcerating criminals, states are
reluctant to invest in prison space. In fiscal year 1990, only 2.5
percent of total expenditures by state and local governments went for
corrections. And investment in new prison construction was only a
small fraction of that figure, according to 1989-1990 figures on
government finances from the Bureau of the Census. (See Bureau of the
Census, U.S. Department of Commerce, Government Finances: 1989-90
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991), p. 2.)
<P>
     While there are those who argue that America is using prison
space for many people who do not belong there, the truth is that 93
percent of those in prison are repeat or violent offenders (the rest
are drug traffickers or burglars). (See Bureau of Justice Statistics,
U.S. Department of Justice, Prisons and Prisoners in the United States
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1992), p. 16.) In
the face of the overwhelming need for more prison space, spending on
corrections remains a tiny percentage of state and local budgets.
States need to commit sufficient resources to building and operating
prisons, or risk the continuing collapse of the criminal justice
system.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #5: Impose an effective death penalty for the most
     heinous crimes.
<P>
     The death penalty has an important role to play in deterring and
punishing the most heinous violent crimes. ( On the deterrent effects
of capital punishment: see generally Stephen J. Markman and Paul G.
Cassell, "Protecting the Innocent: A Response to the Bedau-Radelet
Study," Stanford Law Review, Vol. 41 (1988), pp. 121, 154-56
(collecting studies that demonstrate deterrent effects of the death
penalty); Stephen K. Layson, "Homicide and Deterrence: A Reexamination
of the United States Time-Series Evidence," Southern Economics
Journal, Vol. 52 (1985), pp. 68, 75-80 (estimating that each execution
in the U.S. deters approximately eighteen murders). On its retributive
effects: see, for example, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,
Establishing Constitutional Procedures for the Imposition of Capital
Punishment, S. Rep. No. 251, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983), p. 13
("Murder does not simply differ in magnitude from extortion or
burglary or property destruction offenses; it differs in kind. Its
punishment ought to also differ in kind. It must acknowledge the
inviolability and dignity of innocent human life. It must, in short,
be proportionate.").) But it must be a real and certain penalty to be
effective. In addition to its deterrent value, capital punishment
permanently removes extremely violent offenders from society. And the
death penalty upholds society's goal of just retribution: It affirms
the moral outrage of the community at the ruthless taking of human
life and assures the victim's loved ones that society takes their loss
seriously. 
<P>
     At the very least, states should make the death penalty an option
for juries to consider in three situations:
<P>
First, it is appropriate for the killing of a law enforcement officer.
     This sends a clear message to violent criminals: Murdering a
     police officer to avoid identification or later arrest is not
     worth it, no matter how long a prison term the criminal faces.
<P>
Second, it is appropriate for those who kill while also committing
     serious felonies. In the California case of People v. Love, (366
     P.2d 33, 41-42 (Cal. 1961).) a collection of convicts' statements
     from police files and other sources indicates that their
     decisions to use toy guns during felonies, not to use firearms to
     resist arrest, and not to kill hostages were motivated by fear of
     the death penalty. The death penalty raises the stakes for these
     criminals, and therefore helps protect the victims of their
     crimes. 
<P>
Third, it is appropriate for killing while in prison. Many criminals
     already serving life sentences in jail feel they have little to
     lose by killing a correctional officer or fellow inmate. The
     death penalty introduces a new level of punishment.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #6: Require prisoners to work or perform community
     service to defray the costs of their imprisonment.
<P>
     Taxpayers pay for a prisoner's room and board, health care, and
all other expenses. In return, able-bodied prisoners should be
required to do something useful for the taxpayers, such as maintaining
prison property. Restrictions on this practice should be applied only
where there is a significant risk of taking jobs away from law-abiding
American workers.
<P>
     There are many benefits associated with prison work. The Federal
Bureau of Prisons recently published preliminary findings from its
Post Release Employment Project (PREP), which compared federal
convicts who received training and work in prison with a control group
which did not. The study's preliminary findings offer strong support
for prison labor programs: Inmates who worked in prison were less
likely to engage in prison misconduct, less likely to commit crimes
after release, and significantly more likely to be gainfully employed
one year after release. (See Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S.
Department of Justice, Post Release Employment Project, Preliminary
Findings (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991),
pp. 6, 10-11.)
<P>
     States should enact laws or promulgate regulations requiring all
able-bodied felons in prison to perform some labor useful to the
public. State legislators also should enact laws making a certain
percentage of the cost of each prisoner's incarceration part of a
mandatory fine imposed as part of sentence. Proceeds from both of
these should be used to defray correctional costs.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #7: Impose drug testing throughout the criminal justice
     process.
<P>
     Violence is a way of life for those who use and distribute drugs.
More than a third of state prisoners serving time for a violent crime
said they were under the influence of drugs at the time the offense
occurred. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of
Justice, Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, 1988 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1988), p. 624.) 
<P>
     States should impose drug testing on those arrested for certain
felonies. This would enable judges to decide more appropriately the
conditions for pretrial release and sentencing after conviction.
Random drug testing in prison also would help cut use in prisons and
discourage the smuggling of drugs into prisons. In addition, periodic
drug tests generally should be required of prisoners on supervised
release after conviction for a serious felony, and the use of drugs
during probation or parole should result in automatic revocation of
release status. Finally, where possible, the cost of these drug tests
should be offset by a fee imposed on those tested. 
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #8: Seize assets to fight crime and to supplement law
     enforcement resources.
<P>
     Asset forfeiture is a one-two punch in the fight against crime.
First, it strips criminals of their ill-gotten gains -- it assures
them that crime does not pay. And second, it reinvests those assets as
funding for law enforcement programs. In fiscal year 1991 alone, the
U.S. Department of Justice deposited $643.6 million into the Asset
Forfeiture Fund and shared $266.8 million in cash and $21.2 million in
property with state and local law enforcement organizations as a
result of joint operations. (Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture,
Office of the Deputy Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,
Annual Report of the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund,
Fiscal Year 1991 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1992), pp. 53, 55.)
<P>
     States can use this sanction in addition to criminal prosecution
in drug trafficking and certain violent crime cases. Still, asset
forfeiture laws should also be applied constitutionally, with proper
regard for due process protections. To assist states in doing so, the
Department of Justice, with the National District Attorneys
Association and the National Association of Attorneys General, has
developed a Model Asset Seizure and Forfeiture Act which contains a
comprehensive set of recommendations for states.

<P>
PUNISHING AND DETERRING YOUNG CRIMINALS
<P>
     Juvenile crime has risen rapidly over the last two decades,
especially violent offenses. The real answer to this problem lies
outside the criminal justice system. As Heritage Foundation scholar
Robert Rector demonstrates, it is the basic institutions of society --
family, schools, churches, and neighborhood groups -- that instill
values and mold children into good citizens. (Rector, op. cit.) Only
when these institutions once again intervene effectively in shaping
the lives of young Americans will juvenile crime be cut substantially.
<P>
     Still, law enforcement has a key role. State legislators and
officials need to distinguish between categories of juvenile
offenders. The vast majority of juvenile offenders have only one or
two brushes with the law and straighten out as they mature. But there
is a smaller group of chronic hardened juvenile offenders, who commit
most of the violent juvenile crime. Unfortunately, juveniles are the
fastest growing group of violent offenders. As the following graph
shows, the arrest rates of juveniles for violent crime have increased
significantly in recent years, particularly since 1985. (Bennett, op.
cit., p. 4.) And the increase in juvenile crimes is responsible for a
large share of the general increase in violent crime. (See Federal
Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice, Age-Specific
Arrest Rates and Race-Specific Arrest Rates for Selected Offenses,
1965-89 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1990), pp.
31, 73, 213.)

     <P>
RECOMMENDATION #9: Toughen juvenile sanctions to deter nonviolent
     first-time offenders from a life of crime. 
<P>
     In the case of the first, larger group of juvenile offenders, the
goal of policy makers and law enforcement officials is to prevent
these youths from becoming chronic offenders. The best way to do this
is to impose tough sanctions that are carefully tailored to the
offender and are meant to instill the values of discipline and
responsibility. Excessive leniency, on the other hand, wastes the
opportunity to turn the young person around, and instead puts him or
her on the conveyor belt to becoming a career criminal. The juvenile
does not get the message that crime does not pay when he or she is not
penalized for committing a crime. Tough but fair sanctions can stop
the all-too-common pipeline from juvenile offender to adult criminal. 
<P>
     To this end, state officials should develop a range of sanctions
for nonviolent first-time juvenile offenders, with the emphasis on
instilling discipline and responsibility in a tough but fair manner.
To be effective, these sanctions should include institutional
settings, including "boot camps" and highly structured community
service programs, as an alternative to probation. And the use of these
structured sanctions must be for a period long enough to bring about a
change in the pattern of behavior.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #10: Target the small group of chronic violent juvenile
     offenders and treat them as adults.
<P>
     One of the worst statistics from the 1980s is the sharp increase
in the number of juveniles arrested for murder: It rose by 60 percent
between 1981 and 1990, according to the FBI. The corresponding adult
increase was 5.2 percent. In 1990, more than a third of all murders in
America were committed by people under the age of 21. (See Federal
Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice, Crime in the
United States, Uniform Crime Reports, 1990 (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Government Printing Office, 1991), tables 27 and 36.) The growth of
violent juvenile gangs and the tendency of drug rings to use young
teens as drug couriers, enforcers, and even "hit men" have contributed
to this alarming trend. There is an attitude of "Let the kid do it"
among criminals on the street, because of the leniency of many state
juvenile justice systems.
<P>
     For example, in 1988 a fourteen-year-old drug runner in the
District of Columbia shot and killed three people on the same day. The
drug dealer for whom the juvenile worked was convicted of felony
murder, but the juvenile served only 26 months in juvenile detention
for the killings. He was back out on the streets taunting local police
before his seventeenth birthday. (See "D.J.," Washington Post
editorial, July 31, 1991, p. A20.)
<P>
     State criminal justice officers must realize that some youthful
offenders are simply hardened criminals who happen to be young. The
challenge for state officials is to identify this small group of hard-
core offenders and treat them as adults -- which may require some
reform of existing procedures.
<P>
     State legislators should ensure, for example, that their legal
systems permit the discretionary waiver or certification of juveniles
into adult court in appropriate circumstances. One approach would be
to create a legislative presumption that any juvenile age fourteen or
older who commits certain crimes of violence (murder, rape, kidnaping,
armed robbery, for example) will be tried as an adult. The presumption
could be rebutted by showing mitigating factors that argue otherwise. 
<P>
     But where violence is involved, a firearm is used, or multiple
offenses have occurred, the youth has already -- through his own
willful criminal conduct -- left the intended focus of the juvenile
justice system.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #11: Allow judges to use juvenile offense records in
     adult sentencing.
<P>
     Many seemingly first-time adult offenders in this country were
chronic offenders as juveniles, yet evidence of their crimes may not
be available or may be considered legally irrelevant to sentencing for
adult crimes. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 38
percent of convicted murderers in state prison in 1986 had a prior
juvenile conviction; and 13 percent of those had no adult record, only
juvenile ones. (The figures are similar for other violent crimes. For
example, 54 percent of state prisoners convicted of robbery as adults
had a juvenile record -- 15 percent had only prior juvenile
convictions. These figures are based on the raw data underlying the
BJS Special Report, Profile of State Prison Inmates, 1986 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1988).) While it is commendable
to forgive a youthful indiscretion and not penalize an otherwise law-
abiding adult with a criminal record, that is hardly reasonable when a
juvenile offender continues a life of crime into adulthood.
<P>
     To address this problem, the FBI now includes juvenile criminal
history information from the states in the national criminal records
system, and states are urged to forward records of serious offenses to
the FBI. So that this is possible, state officials should review their
expungement and confidentiality statutes affecting juvenile offenses.
State laws, moreover, should allow for the fingerprinting of juveniles
convicted of serious crimes, and career criminal statutes should
provide that juvenile convictions for serious drug and violent crimes
be considered relevant factors in the sentencing of adults.
<P>

<B> PROMOTING FAIR AND SPEEDY TRIALS AND STREAMLINING THE APPEALS PROCESS </B>
<P>
     While it is essential for state officials to increase the
certainty and severity of punishment, it is equally important to
ensure its swiftness and finality. The key to this is the ability of
the criminal justice system to seek and find the truth. Several steps
would help achieve this, substantially enhancing the efficiency of
state criminal justice systems and the deterrent effect of their
punishments.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #12: Enforce speedy trial laws.
<P>
     Victims of crime and members of society at large want to see
justice done and criminals removed quickly from society. Defendants
have an interest in clearing their good names if innocent, or in
beginning to serve their sentences if guilty. All sides have an
interest in determining the facts while evidence and the recollections
of witnesses are still fresh.
<P>
     Despite the clear common interest in speedy trials, and despite
the fact that some form of speedy trial law exists in 45 states, (See
Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Prosecution
of Felony Arrests, 1981 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1986), table 30.) delays in prosecution still pervade many
state systems. In fact, a 1988 study of felony convictions in 300
counties across America found that the average time between arrest and
sentencing was 208 days -- even longer in violent felony and drug
trafficking cases. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department
of Justice, Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1988 (Washington, D.C.:
U.S. Government Printing Office, 1990), p. 7.) 
<P>
     These delays benefit no one but the guilty -- and cause
particular anguish and even danger to the victims of violent crime
awaiting the trial proceedings. Many docket-management techniques are
available to clerks and other state officials to help states ensure
criminal trials take place at the earliest possible date. They should
be used more aggressively.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #13: Reform the rules of evidence to secure the truth
     in criminal trials. 
<P>
     The cost of keeping probative evidence away from juries in
criminal cases is very high, and can result in the release of guilty
criminals to further victimize the innocent. State officials should
review their evidentiary rules to ensure that they promote the search
for truth.     
<P>
     State laws also should allow for admission of evidence seized by
officers acting with an objectively reasonable belief that they are
complying with the law. State legislators can, for example, ensure by
statute that whenever police officers act in good faith, but make a
technical error of law or fact, the evidence should nevertheless be
admitted in court. (In recent years, the Supreme Court has identified
a number of situations where it has declined to apply the exclusionary
rule to enforce the Fourth Amendment; primary among these is the 1984
case of U.S. v. Leon.) Colorado, for example, has enacted a good faith
exception to the exclusionary rule for both warrant and warrantless
cases. In some states, however, this may require a constitutional
amendment.
<P>
     State officials also should review evidence rules governing the
use of prior convictions or acts. There are two settings in which this
is particularly important. The first is in the impeachment of a
defendant who takes the stand. Traditionally, any past conviction for
a felony or a crime involving dishonesty was admissible to impeach the
credibility of the witness. Now, Federal Rule of Evidence 609 imposes
a general ten-year time limit on admissible convictions and requires a
special determination by the judge that the probative value of a
defendant's prior felonies outweighs any prejudicial effect.
<P>
     At a minimum, state evidence codes should be no more restrictive
than Rule 609. Allowing the admission of all convictions involving
felonies and crimes involving dishonesty against all witnesses
(including a defendant) would be even better.
<P>
     Second, many state evidence rules limit the use of past criminal
conduct of the defendant as evidence of guilt. Evidence that the
defendant has committed the same type of crime in the past is
particularly probative in sex crime cases, such as rape and child
molesting, where it shows common modus operandi or other relevant
factors. Studies suggest that recidivism runs high among a substantial
percentage of sex offenders, (See, for example, Bureau of Justice
Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Special Report, Recidivism of
Prisoners Released in 1983 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1989), table 10.) and such information may be key to an
informed evaluation of the credibility of the defendant's denial and
the victim's allegations. In such cases, often the only eyewitness is
the victim, who carries the burden of proof in the trial. State
legislators should provide clear statutory authority for the admission
of evidence of past sex offenses whenever the charge is sexual assault
or child molestation.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #14: Reform state habeas corpus procedures and end
     repetitive challenges by convicted criminals. 
<P>
     In recent years, the writ of habeas corpus has been transformed
from a monument of individual liberty, protecting individuals from
imprisonment without trial, into a device used by prisoners to
reexamine endlessly the issues decided by a full trial, and often even
after unsuccessful appeals. The result: a sapping of judicial
resources, a diminishing of punishment, and a continuing torment of
victims of violent crime.
<P>
     State officials should thoroughly review their habeas corpus laws
to deter frivolous litigation and to close loopholes that can be
abused. Four specific reforms would help improve many state laws:
<P>
States should allow only truly collateral claims to be raised in state
     habeas corpus cases. Any claim that was or could have been
     brought forward in a prisoner's direct appeals should be barred
     explicitly from habeas proceedings.
<P>
States should adopt explicit time limits for the filing of habeas
     corpus petitions (as there are for other categories of cases,
     from tort suits to contract claims), beginning from the time the
     petitioner has concluded his direct appeals.
<P>
States should bar successive habeas corpus petitions, except where
     sufficient cause is shown for previous failure to raise the claim
     and the claim, if proved, would address the prisoner's factual
     guilt. 
<P>
States should adopt the retroactivity standard of the 1988 Supreme
     Court case Teague v. Lane, (489 U.S. 288 (1989)) which provides
     that changes in the law after trial and appeal will not apply
     retroactively unless they prohibit a particular crime or
     sentence, or greatly improve the truth-seeking function of the
     trial.
<P>

<B> DETECTING AND PREVENTING CRIME </B>
<P>
     Police and prosecutors in this country are in general doing an
excellent job. But their efforts are often frustrated by a cumbersome
and bureaucratic system that does not give them the tools they need to
get the job done. These tools include proper equipment, better
training, and the appropriate legal authority to apprehend and convict
violent offenders. Law enforcement is not just another line item in
the state budget -- it is the first duty of government. State
legislators should realize that something is wrong if this is not
reflected in budgetary priorities.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #15: Invest in quality law enforcement personnel and
     coordinate social welfare programs with law enforcement
     resources.
<P>
     Members of the police force today are often outgunned by drug
traffickers and gangs, who have access to high-powered weapons and
ordnance. The police need top quality equipment. States should make
sure their officers have adequate firepower and should make body armor
available to every officer. Use of body armor should be mandatory for
officers charged with the execution of arrest and search warrants. 
<P>
     Prosecutors likewise deserve and require adequate tools. In the
face of increasingly complex cases involving money laundering,
racketeering, search and seizure, and intricate drug distribution
rings, specialized training is often needed but not always available.
Likewise, state judges and clerks of court, handling ever-larger
criminal caseloads, need adequate support staff and equipment for case
management. 
<P>
     State officials should in addition coordinate law enforcement
resources with other public expenditures. While it is true that law
enforcement cannot do the job alone, it is also true that social
programs cannot succeed without effective law enforcement. (For a
comprehensive strategy of social and welfare reforms, coupled with a
law enforcement program, see Rector, op. cit.) What good is it to
build the finest schools, only to have them taken over by gangs? What
good are costly improvements in public housing, if units then are
converted into crack houses for drug dealers? Community revitalization
efforts must be combined with tough law enforcement to successfully
reduce violence and improve the lives of those held in its grip. (See
Carl F. Horowitz, "An Empowerment Strategy for Eliminating
Neighborhood Crime," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 814, March
5, 1991.) The "Weed and Seed" concept, a model program begun by the
Department of Justice in 1991, does just this. Federal, state, and
local law enforcement agencies pool their resources to "weed out"
targeted street gangs and drug dealers. Social programs can then take
root in the crime-free area, "seeding in" opportunity and hope for
residents. Between the two elements, community policing acts as a
bridge, so that police and community groups can build a productive
relationship to help prevent crime from resurfacing in the
neighborhood.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #16: Computerize criminal history records in a
     reliable, accurate, and timely fashion.
<P>
     Quick access to accurate criminal history records is important
for two reasons: First, criminal history records are necessary in
deciding pretrial detention issues. A past record of violence or
failure to appear is crucial information to a judge deciding whether
to detain a defendant. Second, reliable criminal history records are
the key to effective career criminal statutes, important for general
sentencing purposes, and vital for resource planning in the justice
system. Also, a criminal records data base is the foundation for a
point-of-sale check prior to firearms purchases. 
<P>
     Many states have serious problems with delays and backlogs in
reporting the final disposition of cases. These delays can mean a
three-month lag, or longer, between the end of the trial and the entry
of the data. To help alleviate this problem, the Department of Justice
set aside $27 million in 1992 to be made available to the states over
three fiscal years to upgrade the quality of their criminal history
records systems. In addition, since late 1992, all states must
dedicate at least five percent of federal formula grants from the
Department of Justice to improve their criminal history records (at
present levels this would total more than $21 million in additional
federal dollars each year).
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #17: Give prosecutors statutory authority to tighten up
     and target the rules for immunity from prosecution.
<P>
     Offering immunity selectively often is the only way of breaking
into drug enterprises, violent gangs, and sophisticated organized
crime operations. Accomplices and lower-level gang members often are
the only eyewitnesses to suspected crimes by superiors in a criminal
organization.
<P>
     Prosecutors also often must grant immunity to witnesses in order
to prevent them from asserting their Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination. Federal prosecutors have the choice of granting
two types of immunity: "Use" immunity prohibits the government from
using the compelled testimony, either directly or indirectly, to build
a case against a witness. It is possible, however, to prosecute based
on other independently gathered evidence. "Transactional" immunity
protects an immunized witness from prosecution for any criminal
transaction mentioned in the compelled testimony. Prosecution is
barred by transactional immunity even where independent evidence of
criminality is discovered. 
<P>
     Right now, state laws are a hodgepodge on the subject of
immunity. Despite the fact that the United States Supreme Court has
held that "use" immunity is constitutionally sufficient, several
states still provide only for transactional immunity, which eliminates
forever the opportunity to prosecute these witnesses even if the
evidence of their crimes was gathered independently of their
testimony. In addition, several states provide for automatic
transactional immunity to all grand jury witnesses. 
<P>
     State immunity laws should be comparable to the federal immunity
statute (18 U.S.C. sec. 6002.) -- prosecutors should be granted the
authority to request immunity and to decide whether it should be use
or transactional. Otherwise, investigations can be thwarted, and
clever witnesses can literally get away with murder. (See New York
State District Attorneys Association, "The Case for a New Immunity Law
in New York" (1988), p. 6.)
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #18: Allow the use of sophisticated electronic
     surveillance technology.
<P>
     With the advent of large-scale illegal drug trafficking and
organized crime cases, especially those involving Asian gangs and Cosa
Nostra families, electronic surveillance of suspects is essential. The
leaders of these organizations often are able to avoid direct
involvement in crimes while planning and coordinating increasingly
sophisticated criminal activity over the phone. Electronic
surveillance can build an extremely effective case by using the
criminal's own words, while also avoiding the risks of using
undercover agents or informants.
<P>
     One way to penetrate sophisticated criminal networks
electronically is to use a "pen register," a device which records the
outgoing numbers dialed from a telephone. The United States Supreme
Court has held that the use of a pen register is not a search within
the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and thus neither probable cause
nor a warrant is needed to use one. (See Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S.
735 (1979).)
<P>
     Conversely, a trap-and-trace device, like Caller ID, reveals the
phone number of all incoming calls to a particular number. In order to
use such a device, federal law requires police application to a court
and a showing that the information obtained from its use will be
relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. (18 U.S.C. sec.
3121-27.) The statute, while creating a legal obligation for phone
companies, landlords, and others to assist police in the installation
of these devices, also provides protection for law enforcement
officers and telephone companies from civil and criminal liability for
actions taken under the statute.
<P>
     Currently, some fifteen states make no provision for court-
ordered electronic surveillance. Others, such as California, have weak
electronic surveillance laws. Others require warrants and probable
cause. 
<P>
     State legislators should review these laws to ensure that
statutory authority exists for electronic surveillance, pen registers,
and trap-and-trace devices. Statutory and constitutional change should
be made where needed.
<P>

<B> ASSURING VICTIMS' RIGHTS </B>
<P>
     Criminal justice serves a twofold purpose: to bring criminals to
justice, and to bring justice to victims. One way to make sure that
appropriate weight is given to victims' rights is to codify and
enforce a "Victims' Bill of Rights." Congress did just this in the
Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and urged the states to
follow suit. Victims of a crime have the right to be protected from
further violence, to expect restitution from financial loss, and to
participate in the criminal justice process. And the criminal justice
system should do all it can to lessen the pain of victims and victim-
witnesses. 
<P>
     Potential victims of crime also have the right to protection.
Victims of stalkers, for instance, should not have to wait until they
are attacked to have effective recourse. State legislators should
enact stalking laws that make it a crime to harass or follow a person
if it puts the victim in fear of death or serious injury. If a
restraining order is in effect at the time of an attack, an enhanced
penalty should be considered.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #19: Give victims a hearing and consideration at
     sentencing.
<P>
     In most states, defendants have the right to address the court
after conviction and before sentencing -- to tell their story and to
ask for mercy. State officials should provide the victim with a
similar right to inform the court about the impact of the crime on his
or her life before a sentence is given. The right should be extended
to victims' families in capital cases. Likewise, parole statutes
should provide that the impact of early release on victims or their
survivors be a consideration bearing on early release decisions or
other discretionary actions of the parole authority.
<P>
     The victim also should have a right to be present at all public
court proceedings related to the crime, which is often the most
traumatic thing that has ever happened to that person. Victims deserve
the right to watch the criminal justice system address the wrong done
to them.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #20: Help victim-witnesses with case coordinators.
<P>
     Victim-witness coordinators are an important link between victims
of crime and the criminal justice system, keeping victims apprised of
developments in the case, informing them of possibilities of
restitution, and notifying them of the release status of the offender.
Victim-witness coordinators should be made more aware of the state
programs funded through the Victims of Crime Act, and such services
offered by programs for victim compensation and assistance,
counseling, and even shelter for battered women.
<P>
     
RECOMMENDATION #21: Assure restitution, adequate compensation, and
     assistance for victims of crime.
<P>
     While every state has some type of victim restitution law, not
all are well enforced. Effective mechanisms for collecting fines and
restitution payments must exist, so that victims are relieved of the
humiliating task of having to chase down the offender personally to
obtain recompense for their injuries.
<P>
     State officials should also make sure that any profits a criminal
makes directly or indirectly from his crimes -- including from book
and movie deals -- are made available to the victim for restitution.
Where possible, states also should provide for reasonable compensation
for victim-witnesses, including payment for travel and loss of work
time, and assistance with day care and similar costs of giving
testimony.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #22: Adopt rules to protect victim-witnesses from
     courtroom intimidation and harassment. 
<P>
     Every state should enact two evidentiary protections for
complaining witnesses. The first is the rape-shield law. A good model
is Federal Rule of Evidence 412, which makes reputation or opinion
evidence concerning the past sexual behavior of the alleged victim
inadmissible in the trial for sex crimes. Admission of such evidence
violates the victim's privacy, increases the trauma of the trial, and
discourages victims from coming forward in the first place.
<P>
     Second, every state should protect child witnesses from traumatic
confrontations with their alleged abusers. In the 1990 case of Craig
v. Maryland, the Supreme Court noted that placing a child witness in
proximity to an alleged abuser or molester may do serious
psychological damage, and may overwhelm the child so much that he
cannot accurately testify to events. 
<P>
     The Maryland statute, upheld by the Supreme Court in Craig,
provides a useful model. If the trial judge deems it necessary, the
child's testimony is taken by closed-circuit television with only the
attorneys and, if necessary, a guardian present.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #23: Require HIV testing of sex offenders before trial.
 <P>
     Because of the AIDS epidemic, sex crimes have become even more
terrifying and traumatic for victims. At the request of the victim,
states should provide for mandatory HIV testing of defendants in
sexual offense cases before trial, in order to reduce the uncertainty
victims must endure. Test results should be available to the victim
and to the court in a way that safeguards the victim's
confidentiality. Also, at the request of the victim, defendants should
be tested again periodically, consistent with the latency period of
the HIV virus. Most important of all, states should provide enhanced
penalties for HIV-positive offenders who commit sexual offenses in the
knowledge that they may transmit the virus to the victim.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #24: Notify victims of all criminal justice proceedings
     and the release status of the offender.
<P>
     Many victims of crime understandably fear that they will be
victimized again by the same offender after his release. Victims
should be told of any change in a convicted criminal's status, such as
enrollment in work-release programs, weekend furlough, or community
incarceration. States should also ensure that adequate protective
measures be taken before release, where there is a legitimate fear of
more victimization.

<P>
<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     On the federal level, President Clinton should use the power of
his office to continue the federal effort against crime. In so doing,
he should build upon the progress of his predecessors, Presidents
Reagan and Bush, in strengthening the criminal justice system. 
<P>
     At the same time, state legislators and judicial officials can
and should take concrete steps to make America safer. Concerned
citizens, victims of crime, and law enforcement leaders are working to
strengthen the criminal justice system. Law-abiding citizens, however,
are asking if their state and local public safety laws are as
effective as those of the federal government and the more rigorous
states. They want police and prosecutors to have the tools they need
to combat gangs, drug dealers, and chronic violent offenders. They
want states to ensure that dangerous criminals are in prison, not in
their neighborhood. And they want victims of crime to have the same
say as the criminals do in the system. The recommendations of the Barr
report provide a sound foundation for making the fundamental changes
necessary to protect the safety of all Americans.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"We're not report takers. We're the police."<sup>2</sup>  This bold message greets visitors to the New York City Police Department's crime strategy center, where for three hours, twice a week, the city's 76 precinct commanders gather to report their challenges and successes. And during William J. Bratton's brief tenure as Commissioner of Police, the department achieved some stunning successes: since 1993, a 36 percent drop in serious crimes, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45 percent drop in murder.<sup>3</sup>  Bratton's winning strategy: Hammer home his aggressive, crime-fighting, morale-building message to his troops while demanding (and getting) measurable results in combating crime and disorder from his commanders in the field.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is possible to achieve dramatic reductions in crime. As a result of New York City's success, "Mayors, police chiefs, and scholars from San Diego to Singapore to Saudi Arabia come crowding into the NYPD's meeting room to learn first hand how this new technique works," says George L. Kelling, professor of criminology at Northeastern University.<sup>4</sup>  Moreover, many other innovative local officials are enjoying successes similar to New York City's. "Police can reduce crime now, within constraints. They needn't wait for new cars or computers, more cops, bigger budget or more overtime," says Professor Kelling.<sup>5</sup>  More than anything else, local police need solid personnel management and a clear mission to combat crime and disorder, with serious backup from the public, the politicians, and the press. Bratton's stunning success in New York City is largely attributable to his progressive vision of what the police can do to control crime.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The gains made by New York and other cities in fighting crime have not been achieved by accident. They have happened because innovative police officials have learned the lessons of experience and used them to improve policing. Among the lessons and actions taken:<ul>
<p><li>
<b>Police should target urban America's "hot spots" and career criminals.</b> Successful police departments focus on the decaying and disordered spaces where most of the nation's serious crime takes place. Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in an urban area. They also target urban America's tiny criminal class: the 6 percent of the male population responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime.
<p><li>
<b>Good policing requires high recruitment standards.</b> While Americans want the best police protection, too many metropolitan areas around the United States have witnessed a deliberate -- often politically motivated -- lowering of intellectual, physical, and character standards within the police force. Failure to maintain standards leads to a loss of ,lan among police officers themselves. Poor personnel practices result in bad, brutal, or incompetent police officers and a lowering of public confidence.
<p><li>
<b>Police should be on the beat, not behind a desk.</b> Instead of keeping order and enforcing the law, too many police officers are patrolling ineffectively or being employed in ancillary functions that could be performed just as easily by civilians or private agencies. These managerial and political decisions compromise the integrity and effectiveness of local law enforcement.
</ul><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local officials can learn from the experience of the growing number of cities and localities that have strengthened their police forces through their own efforts. These localities have improved personnel management, including direct accountability for police performance, while also employing the most effective strategies and the most sophisticated technical and information systems to track, prevent, and combat violent crime. Without waiting for official Washington, local officials can take decisive steps to improve their own police departments. These steps include<ul>

<p><li><b>Upgrading</b> recruitment and training standards;

<p><li><b>Aggressively recruiting</b> police officers from the ranks of the military (which would expand the number of well-qualified black and minority applicants);

<p><li><b>Improving</b> the techniques used to detect and prevent crime;

<p><li><b>Targeting</b> the small number of criminals responsible for most of the serious crime;

<p><li><b>Focusing</b> on urban "hot spots" where crime flourishes;

<p><li><b>Making</b> salaries commensurate with responsibilities and performance;

<p><li><b>Privatizing</b> and civilianizing non-police administrative functions;

<p><li><b>Promoting</b> community policing; and

<p><li><b>Demanding</b> direct accountability of police commanders in the field. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Support from the State and Courts</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Even with excellent police work, violent criminals typically serve only a portion of their sentences, often as little as one-third.<sup>6</sup>  The tireless work of police officers and detectives often seems to be in vain, as repeat violent offenders are released from prison after spending minimal time behind bars. To back up the police, legislatures and courts must act to keep violent criminals and other perpetrators of serious crimes off the streets. Among the remedial measures needed are the reform of parole and probation systems and the adoption of truth in sentencing laws to make sure that violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.<sup>7</sup>  Police officers have a personal interest in such policies: Between 1988 and 1992, 20 percent of all persons arrested for killing law enforcement officers were on probation or parole at the time of the offense.<sup>8</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress also can support America's local police, but not in the ways that often characterize action in Washington. In response to the continuing escalation of violent crime, the 103rd Congress, with the support of President Clinton, enacted the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994. The promise: 100,000 additional police officers on neighborhood streets.<sup>9</sup>  But thus far, the program has meant little more than 17,000 additional police on the streets. Worse, the Administration's funding allocation does not target localities hardest hit by violent crime, and many local governments are finding it difficult to bear the required financial burden of the matching formula.<sup>10</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress could be far more helpful by:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Providing more flexible federal funding for local law enforcement, such as federal tax rebates to states for use in combating violent crime.</b> This would enable local officials to tailor financing to those aspects of law enforcement that best meet the needs of their communities. Alternatively, Congress could make $10 billion in block grants available to local police agencies over a period of five years to target the areas hardest hit by violent crime, as proposed by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL).

<p><li><b>Reforming criminal procedure.</b> This means such things as enacting reform of the so-called exclusionary rule, which passed the House of Representatives earlier this year, to allow a good faith exception in the gathering of evidence during criminal investigations. Hearings on the impact of the <I>Miranda</I> rule governing the taking of statements from suspects doubtless would prove enlightening and might build support for reasonable changes. In exercising their confirmation responsibilities with regard to the appointment of federal judges, Senators also could and should block the appointment of any candidate with a record of demonstrated insensitivity to public safety. Congress recently achieved a long-overdue reform by putting a stop to the judicial imposition of prison caps on state and local prisons. These court-imposed caps have been putting violent felons back on America's streets.<sup>11</sup>  Police officers and crime victims alike have been frustrated and demoralized by such liberal judicial policies. 

<p><li><b>Improving the social environment by replacing failed federal urban policies with a new neighborhood empowerment strategy.</b> Inner-city communities can be renewed through genuine enterprise zones. Scholarships and vouchers can help poor children escape crime-ridden schools and attend the schools of their choice, including religious schools that respect parental responsibility, reinforce the moral teachings of their parents, and promote civilized conduct. Federal policies can encourage effective neighborhood social service agencies, including faith-based drug treatment and counseling activities, to improve the social climate. Strong community-based organizations, working closely with the police, also can help prevent crime. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) are sponsoring comprehensive legislation, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467), to accomplish these goals.<sup>12</sup>
</ul><p>
 
<b>BACK TO BASICS: WHY PUBLIC OFFICIALS NEED TO RETHINK THE ROLE OF THE POLICE</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local police are invested with awesome public authority, yet they often lack the public respect or official understanding that their specific duties should command.<sup>13</sup>  They are expected to make instantaneous and complex decisions, to put themselves in danger, and to act calmly in the most terrifying circumstances, yet they are often underpaid and lack the status of other public officials in much less demanding occupations. Many police officers find this combination of demands and pressures demoralizing.14 <P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The inherent problem of police work is that the law often specifies what the police officer cannot do; it does not tell him what he should do.<sup>15</sup>  In virtually every public or private institution, the discretion available to a person is directly proportional to his rise in the hierarchy. Those at the top have the most discretion, while those at the bottom have the least. But discretion in the exercise of police authority increases as one goes <I>down</I> the hierarchy.<sup>16</sup>  Whether working alone or with a partner, the police officer usually is not subject to any immediate supervision, and his judgments under pressure are subjected to constant analysis and second-guessing by the public and the courts.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As former New York City Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy has noted, the ideal police officer is in tune with the community and able to spot a likely problem before the fact, not just respond after the fact to something that already has become a local tragedy.<sup>17</sup>  Ideally, under circumstances less threatening than a life-or-death situation, a police officer functions best as a "streetcorner politician," peacefully settling disputes and using his social skills to assuage potential combatants and maintain order.<sup>18</sup>  Thus, the special challenge for local officials is to make sure that the recruit is a person of "quiet confidence" who can take control of a situation without identifying criminal resistance to established public authority as some sort of personal slight.<sup>19</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This constant need to exercise prudential judgment illuminates yet another paradox of police work. Police management is likely to give a cop "credit" for an arrest, and yet the resort to an arrest may very well represent a genuine failure to keep order. If a neighborhood dispute is resolved carefully, the police intervention is an unrecorded success.<sup>20</sup>  But if the officer fails to defuse the situation, and there is a crime leading to an arrest and prosecution, the cop who lets the situation deteriorate gets "credit" for the arrest.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For state and local officials, the heart of police reform is personnel management.<sup>21</sup>  The higher educational achievements of officers recruited during the 1940s contributed to the "professionalization" of the police from the 1950s on, and generally produced tougher standards in recruiting urban police officers. In New York City, for example, standardized tests, including IQ tests, were common during the 1950s and 1960s, and the performance of recruits in the Police Academy invariably was above the average for the population generally. As Arthur Niederhoff, a veteran officer and authority on the New York City Police Department, has reported, any recruit with an IQ below the normal range had only a small chance of being recruited either by the NYPD or by other major police departments.<sup>22</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1950s and 1960s, the New York City Police Department also undertook rigorous background investigations into the character, reputation, and medical and psychological histories of recruits. Approximately 50 percent of the applicants who passed the examinations eventually were eliminated.<sup>23</sup>  The rule was simple: Any doubt concerning an applicant's fitness for appointment was to be resolved in "favor of the department."<sup>24</sup>  The rules governing retention on the force were likewise rigorous: Officers were expected to refrain from any behavior (including immoral personal behavior) "that would tend to bring adverse criticism of the department."<sup>25</sup>  During the 1950s and early 1960s, the rate of acceptance in the NYPD was only 15 percent.<sup>26</sup>  In Tucson, Arizona, the acceptance rate during the same period was 6 percent; and in Los Angeles, California, the acceptance rate from 1950-1962 was only 4 percent.<sup>27</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With the recent trend in many cities back to community policing, the job requirements are likely to be even stiffer. One recent study of the competencies essential in "a community policing environment" concludes that "skills in effective verbal communication, listening and demonstration of empathy or understanding in a multicultural society are extremely essential. The ability to identify problems, make commitments, understand the reality of the police impact on crime, analyze situations, demonstrate persistence, employ situational strategies, and recognize solutions to problems are also extremely essential competencies."<sup>28</sup>

In recent years, the working conditions for patrol officers have become tougher. As police departments have become more specialized and bureaucratic, officers have been moved from the street to staff jobs even as crime rates and the workload of patrol officers have increased. The result: "Odd hours, overtime, and off-duty court appearances, not to mention the most dangerous job in the organization, [have made] patrol work the least desirable policing assignment. Ironically, like the classroom teacher and the ward nurse, it is the lowest paid and least respected part of the operation."<sup>29</sup>

Local officials should be aware that demoralization is a serious and recurrent occupational hazard among police officers. In urban areas, the social and economic elites have largely abandoned the central cities, and inner-city communities themselves are often crime-ridden. Big-city police often feel they are fighting a losing battle against overwhelming odds. Far too many of the persons they arrest for violent crimes are out on probation, parole, or pre-trial release.

Police also are frustrated with lenient judges and frequent plea bargaining arrangements. In 1993, for example, 90 percent of the 200,000 felony convictions in the United States were plea bargained.<sup>30</sup>  In one survey, 60 percent of police officers felt that criminal plea bargaining was "unfair to the arresting officer."<sup>31</sup>  Such frustration and cynicism, compounded by poor personnel management, fuel police demoralization. They also contribute to what is known as "the cop culture," the fraternal secrecy and mutual self-defense network thrown up to protect good and bad cops alike. Not surprisingly, studies also indicate that the suicide rate among police officers is more than twice that of the general population.<sup>32</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Americans strongly support putting more police on the streets.<sup>33</sup>  The popular assumption is that increasing the number of police will decrease crime rates, but the quantity of police does not make up for poor management of police or poor working conditions. In 1992, for instance, Washington, D.C.'s homicide rate was six times higher, and its overall serious crime rate two times higher, than San Diego's. Yet Washington had five times as many police officers per capita as San Diego. Moreover, in 1989, when Washington increased its overall police force by 19 percent under congressional mandate, serious violent crime actually rose by 15 percent, and homicide jumped 9 percent over a period of one year.<sup>34</sup>  Between 1952 and 1978, total police personnel in the United States rose from 254,000 to 689,000, an increase of 171 percent; between 1957 and 1978, incidents of reported crime rose from 1,422,000 to 11,141,3000, an increase of 657 percent.<sup>35</sup>  Overall, "More than a dozen major empirical studies over the last two decades have failed to demonstrate either that police manpower and crime rates vary inversely or that particular types of community-oriented policing practices prevent crime."<sup>36</sup>  Declares Dr. Gregory Berg, a veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, "We know that the number of police on the street and police methods in general have little effect on crime rates."<sup>37</sup>

Fortunately, imaginative public policy is running ahead of public policy research. In New York City and elsewhere, innovative policing is having a measurable impact on crime -- again, not because of the numbers or mere presence of the police, but because of what the police are doing. With the evolution of modern information systems and the application of improved strategic thinking on the part of police managers, much more fruitful research is possible.<sup>38</sup> Local officials can adopt strong empirical measures of police performance. But success rests ultimately on the intangibles: Courage and character, sound judgment, a solid knowledge of law and procedure, and an ability to apply them in ambiguous, often dangerous and difficult situations. Officials must realize that these qualities are essential in any person who is given broad discretion, armed with a deadly weapon, and pledged to serve and protect the citizens of the community.

<p>
<b>COMPETENCE AND CONFIDENCE: KEEPING LAW AND ORDER</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Approximately 80 percent of the urban police officer's job is "restoring order."<sup>39</sup>  In practice, this means coping with such relatively minor things as drunken and disorderly conduct, loud noise in the neighborhood, fights and scuffles, or bar-room brawls. It is also the main interest of the public: "In focus groups, community meetings and surveys, citizens regularly report the biggest safety concerns to be things like panhandling, obstreperous youth taking over parks or street corners, public drinking, prostitution and other disorderly behavior. Such concerns cross class, race, and ethnic boundaries, and occur in all areas of the country."<sup>40</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In any given circumstance, restoring order involves intervening and settling a "dispute" about what is "right" or "seemly."<sup>41</sup>  Thus, the situation is governed not only by law, but by the social circumstances and prevailing "subculture" of the neighborhood or community. Indeed, custom is often more important than law in "street situations."<sup>42</sup>  While these incidents may appear to be minor, they can be dangerous, for they often involve personal "honor and dishonor."  Despite its importance to the public, police are often "defensive" in keeping order. They recognize that they are dealing, at least initially, with minor offenses or " misdemeanors" which are unlikely to result in jail or even significant fines. This means that the entire process of arrest, booking, and preliminary hearings is, in most instances, a waste of limited and valuable time; "[t]he most important consequence of this state of affairs is that with respect to routine police matters, the normal tendency of the police is to underenforce the law."<sup>43</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The best guide to making an arrest in such cases is the police officer's own experience and judgment, combined with a strong working knowledge of the law. A notorious neighborhood troublemaker, well-known to the police, for example, invariably is a good candidate for arrest and is worth the personal investment in the time and paperwork the arrest entails. Nevertheless, the police officer knows that very few of his arrests are likely to result in prosecution; for every 56 persons arrested by the police, only 1 goes to prison.<sup>44</sup>  Most of those arrested are released within 12 hours.<sup>45</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nowhere is deciding whether to arrest a suspect more difficult than in cases of domestic violence. In 1984, for example, a controlled experiment in Minneapolis found that male batterers arrested by the police were largely deterred by these arrests which were "more effective" than "peacekeeping strategies."<sup>46</sup>  Further analysis revealed, however, that while this strategy worked if the male batterer was employed, the arrest of batterers who were unemployed led to increased violence toward their partners.<sup>47</sup>  State and local officials must be mindful of the trade-off between arrest and police presence on the street, especially in view of the fact that "[t]he deterrent effects of an arrest and of patrol presence on the streets have never been compared."<sup>48</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The effectiveness of the police in maintaining order and quelling disorder has a broad impact on the prevention or reduction of more serious crime. "For decades," however, "most big city police departments have devoted little effort to combatting disorder. By allowing an accumulation of small infractions, this neglect creates an environment that generates big infractions."<sup>49</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Disorder is highest in neighborhoods characterized not only by loss of economic vitality, but also by social instability: broken families, fatherless children, and physically and sexually abusive criminal adults, the ultimate source of crime.<sup>50</sup>  Broken windows, graffiti, drunken and disorderly conduct, prostitution, and the like all say to the small criminal population responsible for most serious urban crime that members of the community are indifferent to the conditions around them and do not care enough to call the police to stop the disorder in their midst.<sup>51</sup>  These disordered territories become "hot spots," geographical areas open to illegal business and more serious crime such as the sale of crack cocaine, which is strongly associated with rises in violent crime. Moreover, most violent crime is the deadly work of a criminal class comprised largely of males aged 15 to 24 from broken families, with low cognitive abilities (particularly low verbal skills) and a history of anti-social behavior and multiple arrests: "The 5 to 7 percent of the population falling into the category of habitual offenders is responsible for no less than half of all arrests or police contacts."  <sup>52</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This spatial concentration has profound implications for effective urban policing: "Spreading more police out across a big city and lowering response time, the research shows, will have little effect on crime -- no matter what neighborhood groups think. But more police attacking the risk factors for crime -- like guns on the street in 'hot spots' street corners -- could make a substantial difference in crime."<sup>53</sup>  This is especially true of gun crime. Of the approximately 200 million guns in the United States, one-third are handguns; and about 2 percent of these handguns are used to commit crimes.<sup>54</sup>  Therefore, "Concentration of police crime prevention in places with the highest gun crime may be the most effective way to protect everyone, not just residents of the high crime locations."<sup>55</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton made the concerted attack on neighborhood disorder a top priority, combining modern management techniques with an older tradition of policing based on a perceived relationship between neighborhood disorder and serious crime. Bratton's "Police Strategy No. 5," for example, declares that "By working systematically and assertively to reduce the level of disorder in the City, the NYPD will act to undercut the ground on which more serious crimes seem possible and even permissible"<sup>56</sup> This neighborhood-based strategy involves an all-out attack on the components of neighborhood disorder, including prostitution, liquor sales to minors, and violations of noise ordinances, as well as felonies. Violators are cited, and persistent violators are arrested; moreover, these arrests are accompanied by probing police interrogations by officers looking for leads to more serious criminal activities, especially gun-related crimes. When Commissioner Bratton headed the New York City Transit Police, his aggressive methods re-established order on New York's subway systems, long a notorious crime "hot spot;" felonies in that system declined 75 percent in four years.<sup>57</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bratton's success in New York City is mirrored to a lesser extent in other metropolitan areas in which police have combined this aggressive neighborhood-based strategy with innovative community policing techniques. Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Sarasota, Florida, for example, are bringing police officers and their families back into troubled neighborhoods through low-interest home loans. Not only do the police live where they work, but the program also sends a positive message to law-abiding residents in these neighborhoods that the police are there to protect them. Chief Charles Austin of Columbia, South Carolina, says that the city's home loan program has contributed to a 16 percent decrease in crime.<sup>58</sup>  Similarly innovative community police programs can be found in cities throughout the United States, including Lowell, Massachusetts; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Indianapolis, Indiana; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and San Diego, California. 
<P>


<b>Enforcing the Law</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
For the officer on the street, enforcing the law or stopping the commission of a serious crime is more clear-cut than settling a dispute over what constitutes "disorderly" behavior. In practice, however, it is difficult to combat serious crime either by preventing it or by arresting the perpetrator after the fact. Police responding immediately to a case make an arrest in only 2.9 percent of all calls involving serious crimes.<sup>59</sup>  Only 25 percent of all calls to the police in cases of serious crime involve actual contact between the victim and the offender; 75 percent of all serious crimes are reported after the fact.<sup>60</sup>  And, as noted previously, almost half of America's violent crime is never even reported to the police.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Once the initial report is taken, the task of resolving serious crimes usually is reserved to the detectives, whose work requires the ability to ask the right questions, a sound capacity for deductive reasoning, and a keen sense of human nature. In most major metropolitan departments, regardless of the social changes that have taken place over many years, detectives are viewed as the professional elite of the police force.<sup>61</sup>  On the face of it, their work is daunting. They must identify, locate, and arrest the suspect and then prepare a careful report of the criminal investigation, replete with all the pertinent facts of the case. This is the crucial body of information to be used by the prosecution both in determining the charge and ultimately in proving its case in court. The detective must prepare for his own testimony and cross examination as a key state witness at the preliminary hearing and at the trial itself, seeing the case through to its ultimate resolution.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since the 1960s, this job has been complicated by a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulings that, in effect, have federalized state criminal procedure, including the rules of evidence, contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and the original intent of the Framers. For example, in <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I> (1961), the Court mandated the exclusion of evidence in cases involving even the most technical violation of the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment. In <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> (1966), the Court held that a person held as a suspect in a criminal case must be informed of his right to remain silent and to have his lawyer with him during the interrogation.<sup>62</sup>  Again, the penalty for even a minor police mistake was exclusion of any statement made by the suspect. <I>Miranda</I> in particular was met with a storm of protest from local police officials, who argued that it would handcuff their investigative work. Congress responded by enacting a provision in the Crime Control Act of 1968 which allowed a judge, after looking at the totality of circumstances surrounding a confession in a federal case and finding that the confession was given to the law enforcement officers voluntarily, to admit the evidence even though not all of the procedural requirements specified in <I>Miranda</I> had been met. This provision has been all but unused by the U.S. Department of Justice.<sup>63</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given this situation, the detective obviously must be sensitive to the fine points of criminal procedure, since defense attorneys may be expected to seize upon the slightest error. Rigorous selection and training of detectives therefore must be among the most important personnel management priorities in any police department. Because uniformed patrolmen constitute the pool from which future detectives will be drawn, state and local officials must pay close attention to the entrance standards for police recruiting and staffing as well.<sup>64</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The most common measurement of law enforcement success is the clearance rate. Technically, a "cleared" case is one in which a person has been arrested, charged with a crime, and turned over to prosecutors. Clearance rates for violent crimes known to the police have been declining for over two decades. In 1972, the clearance rate for reported violent criminal offenses was 48.8 percent. By 1993, it was 42.5 percent.<sup>65</sup>  In some of America's largest cities, including Chicago, Detroit, and San Francisco, according to 1994 FBI statistics, clearance rates for violent crime run as low as 20.7 to 38 percent.<sup>66</sup>  Over the past 30 years, the clearance rate for homicide nationwide has declined by 25 percent, and the ability of police to close cases of forcible rape has declined by 20 percent.<sup>67</sup>  Clearance rates for 1994, the most recent year for which figures are available, ranged from 64 percent in murder cases to 24 percent for robberies and as low as 13 percent for burglaries and 14 percent for motor vehicle thefts.<sup>68</sup>  Thus, a great many of the most serious crimes are never solved.
<p>

<b>Police and Community</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Walking "the beat" used to be the model for urban policing. Officers got to know the residents of the community, and the residents of the community got to know them. This made it relatively easy to maintain order and enhanced the ability of the police to fight crime. Direct or anonymous tips, a well-grounded experience with local troublemakers, a keen sense of the local powers present in the neighborhood, including the very worst influences, all gave police officers quick and often easy access to solid information that could serve as the basis for further questioning and the apprehension of criminals.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Over the past four decades, two developments changed the widespread use of this traditional model. The first was internal: a change in the style and philosophy of urban policing itself. Police officials determined that officers cruising urban or suburban areas in patrol cars would be in a better position to respond to calls for help or assistance. Aside from the speed and mobility of the well-equipped patrol car itself, the practice of using police cars in regular patrols created higher visibility over a larger geographical area. This, it was thought, would better deter crime and make the police, equipped with radios and other equipment, more effective in combatting it.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The second development was external: the dramatic social and cultural changes within the communities themselves. The legal revolution in civil rights and the racial conflict and social tension of the 1960s and 1970s left a legacy of hostility to the police that persists in certain neighborhoods to this day. While urban police in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in large cities, were overwhelmingly white and came from working-class or middle-class backgrounds, they often were policing non-white neighborhoods. This presented new challenges. "The problems created by the exercise of the necessary discretion," as Professor James Q. Wilson has written, "are least in communities that have widely shared values as to what constitutes an appropriate level of order and what kind of person or form of behavior is an empirically sound predictor of criminal intention; the problems are greatest in cities deeply divided along lines of class and race."<sup>69</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since the 1960s, police officers have found themselves responding in different ways to different communities. Disorder in some neighborhoods may lead to little or no intervention by the police, while similar problems in other neighborhoods may cause an entirely different response.<sup>70</sup>  The unspoken assumption is that "Various neighborhoods and subcultures have their own levels of tolerable disorder; what may appear to be weaker norms are only different norms."<sup>71</sup>  Too often, laboring under real or imagined suspicions of racial bigotry, the police have simply given up trying to quell disorder in many minority communities, thus tacitly accepting the academically fashionable premises of cultural and moral relativism and its tragic consequences.<sup>72</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This problem is aggravated by conflicting ideological pressures, particularly among black liberals and leftists, over the appropriate response to crime and disorder in black communities. Paul Butler, a professor of law at George Washington University and former D.C. prosecutor, argues that black jurors should acquit non-violent black criminals, including drug dealers and burglars, even if they are clearly guilty, precisely because they are black and victims of a racist social order.<sup>73</sup>  At the same time, however, in reacting against laws against disorder used by the police in the past as "tools of subjugation" to harass black males, many black citizens in the District of Columbia now find themselves vulnerable to levels of disorder that are not tolerated in middle-class white suburbs.<sup>74</sup>  Says Professor John DiIulio: "You can't have it both ways -- protesting that police are less responsive to black crime victims than white ones in one breath, charging that too many black victimizers get caught, convicted and sentenced in the next; spinning out conspiratorial theories of white acquiescence in letting drugs flow into black communities in the morning, complaining that efforts to crack down on the drug trade are motivated by racism in the afternoon."<sup>75</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Popular reactions to the Rodney King episode and the O. J. Simpson trial highlight the deep racial divisions in Americans' attitudes toward the police. Blacks are more likely than whites to complain about the behavior of police. Surveys also indicate that 49 percent of blacks, but only 22 percent of whites, believe whites get better treatment before the courts and at the hands of police.<sup>76</sup>  Moreover, while 50 percent of whites believe that the police and the courts treat blacks and whites equally, only 29 percent of blacks believe this to be true.<sup>77</sup>  The data on police brutality,<sup>78</sup> however, indicate that such incidents have not been widespread in recent years. According to Robert E. Worden, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at the State University of New York at Albany, "The incidence of the use of improper force is rare in the sense that aircraft fatalities are rare; it is infrequent relative to the large volume of interaction between police and citizens, just as deaths in aircraft accidents are infrequent relative to the large number of passenger miles flown."<sup>79</sup>  When these incidents do occur, they are associated with a variety of factors and, at least historically, more often than not are aggravated by class rather than racial differences.<sup>80</sup>

<p>
<b>PROTECTING MINORITY COMMUNITIES</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many black leaders, both liberal and conservative, argue that the real problem is the absence of police in neighborhoods that are perceived by the officers as "dangerous."  The predominant fear is not of the police, but that the police will abandon the community to criminal predators, some of them mercenary agents of organized crime or drug cartels. "Why doesn't America keep the peace in inner cities?"  ask Glenn C. Loury, Professor of Economics at Boston University, and Shelby Steele, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. "Suppose there were several hundred gang-related murders every year in suburban Chicago or Washington or Los Angeles. Would there be a different public response?"<sup>81</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Young black males are far more likely to be victimized by violent crime than any other segment of America's population. A solid majority of blacks in one survey (57 percent) agreed that there were places in their areas "where they were afraid to walk alone at night."<sup>82</sup>  In a 1994 survey, more than 60 percent of blacks and whites agreed that government was spending "too little" on law enforcement.<sup>83</sup>  The misgivings of Loury and Steele echo the earlier complaints of the late Dr. Martin Luther King: "Permissive crime in ghettos is the nightmare of the slum family. Permissive crime is the name for the organized crime that flourishes in the ghetto -- designed, directed and cultivated by white national crime syndicates operating numbers, narcotics, and prostitution rackets freely in the protected sanctuaries of the ghettos."<sup>84</sup>  The color and ethnic composition of the predators may have changed, but for inner-city residents, the nightmare continues.

<b>LOWERING STANDARDS: <br>
THE HIGH PRICE OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Minority group spokesmen claim, often with justification, that they are "underrepresented" in the staffing of police departments. Police officers must understand the local people and their culture and mores. Neighborhood perceptions of insensitivity or a lack of diversity among police personnel can have a negative impact on police-community relations.<sup>85</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To cope with these social realities, beginning in earnest in the late 1960s, state and local officials attempted to break down long-standing barriers to the hiring of minorities in metropolitan police forces. Federal laws and regulations, particularly those issued by the Nixon Administration, reinforced these efforts. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, no person may be discriminated against or deprived of an opportunity for public service on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; the processes of recruitment, selection, training, and promotion are supposed to be "color-blind" so that all persons are given an equal opportunity. As a result of this combination of changing "social norms" and "the end of overt discrimination," blacks in particular made substantial gains: "Between 1970 and 1990, for example, the number of black police rose from 23,796 to 63,855; they constituted 41 percent of new hires."<sup>86</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But as the effort to increase diversity accelerated, liberal politicians and judges too often departed from the sound principle that individuals should never be rewarded or penalized on the basis of race or sex. To employ more minorities and women, police agencies frequently have adopted systems of quotas and preferences at the expense of quality, causing standards to be lowered and personnel decisions no longer to be based on selecting the most highly qualified candidates, especially in large metropolitan urban areas.<sup>87</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1966, for example, using federal funds under the Manpower Development Training Act, one of many liberal job training programs enacted during the 1960s, New York City officials planned to train 1,000 black and Puerto Rican youths to become policemen through a "Cadet Program."  Whatever the intended benefits of this program, it was a blow to the cause of professionalism within the NYPD, which had sought to attract new recruits who possessed college degrees, because it concentrated on enrolling "minority group drop-outs" to staff the city's police force.<sup>88</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Quotas are both logically incompatible with personnel management based on the principle of merit selection and a departure from the liberal tradition. In the words of the late Justice William O. Douglas, one of the most prominent champions of liberal views on the U.S. Supreme Court, "Minorities in our midst who are to serve actively in our public affairs should be chosen on talent and character alone, not on cultural orientation or leanings."<sup>89</sup>  The irony is that "Cities as a whole suffer from bad police diversity policies, but it is crime ridden minority communities in them that suffer the most."<sup>90</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Various metropolitan governments have deliberately lowered standards for the recruitment and hiring of police officers in recent years. During the early 1990s, for example, the rush to racial and ethnic "diversity" on the New York City police force resulted in the hiring of officers with low test scores and inadequate background investigations. City officials examining police corruption, including officers compromised by notorious drug dealers, argued that the problem was the "institutional culture" of the department. But the lowering of standards clearly contributed to the problem: "True enough, most bad cops have been white, but a disproportionate number of cops indicted in New York have been minority officers hired in recent years to make the city's force more reflective of its demographics."<sup>91</sup>  In other major cities, whether because of "rush hiring" or quotas, the consequences, both in terms of public safety and in terms of public confidence in the hiring process, have been equally alarming.
<blockquote>
	<b>Washington D.C.:</b> Between 1989 and 1990, under congressional authorization, Washington hired 1,500 police officers. As part of this effort, city officials deliberately reduced hiring standards: "Critical background checks on applicants were cut short, and investigators scrimped on visits to neighborhoods and interviews with former employers. Physical examinations were hurried, and some people who failed to meet minimum requirements were hired anyway. The psychological services unit, which had rejected one in five applicants in other years, rejected just one in 20."<sup>92</sup>
<p>
	Since 1989, 201 D.C. police officers have been arrested (some more than once) by their colleagues on charges ranging from drug dealing and shoplifting to rape and murder. Reporters from <I>The Washington Post</I> learned that the department kept a list of 185 police officers with criminal problems so severe that prosecutors could not put them on the witness stand to testify in criminal cases. And a number of the new police officers that they did put on the stand made such poor witnesses that they often injured the prosecution's case. Because of just one narcotics detective who tested positive for cocaine, the U.S. attorney was forced to seek the release of 32 prisoners convicted on the officer's testimony and the dismissal of 88 cases in which the detective was the key witness for the prosecution.<sup>93</sup>  ABC News correspondent Robert Zelnick has noted that "The police department of the nation's Capital has a notorious record of seeing felony charges dismissed because of police incompetence in filling out arrest reports and related records."<sup>94</sup>
<p>
	A D.C. Metropolitan Police training director found that many recruits had tested so low in reading comprehension tests that they needed "remedial classes."  District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry put a stop to such classes because, said the director, he "feared the classes would reflect poorly on D.C. public schools from which many of the recruits had graduated."<sup>94</sup>  As summed up by Edwin J. Delattre, Professor of Education and Philosophy at Boston University, "The part that Congress and top elected officials in the city government have played in this debacle is a disgrace."
<p>
Because of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) racial, ethnic, and gender "diversity" guidelines, D.C. officials have eliminated any meaningful standards for passing grades on te written examinations for police promotions. Candidates for police promotions now can receive "passing grades" merely by answering correctly "less than half" of the questions on the written examination, which costs taxpayers $1 million to administer.<sup>95</sup> Local officials defend this policy by claiming that certain officers do not test well, that tests are not the best indicator of which candidates would make good police officers, and that results in any case must reflect departmental diversity. But such excuses ignore practical reality. In the words of a police official who asked not to be identified for "fear of retribution," the fact remains that "You're talking about guys who can't get half the answers right. I just don't know how a street officer would feel taking orders from a supervisor who can't get half the answers right."<sup>96</sup> 
<p>
	<b>Miami, Florida:</b> In 1980, the city of Miami quickly hired 200 new policemen, with the specification that 80 percent were to be from the city's minority communities. Throughout the orientation and background investigation process, city officials were warned of the deficiencies of this class of future Miami police officers. The results proved disastrous. By 1988, more than a third of the class hired in 1980 were fired; 75 percent of Miami police officers accused of wrongdoing turned out to be members of this class; and 10 ended up pleading guilty to crimes as serious as murder and drug trafficking. "The frenzy of indiscriminate hiring, inadequate training, and poor supervision eroded personnel standards of the Miami Police Department until even illiteracy was no disqualification."<sup>97</sup>
<p>
	<b>Chicago, Illinois:</b> After promising to base police personnel decisions on merit, Mayor Richard J. Daley, Jr., recently reversed himself and determined that the city would use race as a consideration in promoting senior members of the police department. This would allow police officials to promote black and Hispanic candidates above white candidates who scored higher. In 1994, Mayor Daley authorized merit tests for police promotions, and the taxpayers of Chicago paid $5 million to have an outside company develop and administer these tests. Of the top 114 test scores, only 5 were achieved by minority candidates. Daley's decision has angered and demoralized members of the police force. "They told us it was all about merit," remarked William Nolan, President of the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police. "Now we hear it's not about merit, but about politics and race. So, the police force doesn't believe him anymore."<sup>98</sup>
<p>
	<b>Boston, Massachusetts:</b> Bypassing merit testing for appointment to the police force, the city of Boston has entered into a court-ordered consent decree mandating "diversity" in the ranks. While 42 percent of the residents of Boston are members of minority groups, the police department is 26.4 percent minority. The purpose of the new judicially imposed policy is to reduce the racial imbalance and make up for past "exclusion" by elevating minorities over white candidates taking the police examinations. In 1990, nearly 75 percent of white candidates who took the test scored 90 or above, compared to 36 percent of minorities; 11.4 percent of the white candidates scored 98, 99, or 100, compared to 2.9 percent of minorities. Liberal critics claim the police test is inherently discriminatory, and therefore a poor indicator of how a policeman will perform on the job. According to James Kelly, President of the Boston City Council, however, "There were whites who scored 100 on the tests, but they are not Boston police officers for one reason: the color of their skin. What we have now is a quota system."<sup>99</sup>

Poor personnel management has created serious problems in other major metropolitan areas as well. For example, the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Police Department has been ripped by devastating charges of police corruption, and numerous convictions, including convictions in major drug cases, have been overturned because of falsified police reports, illegal tactics, and perjury on the part of police officers.<sup>100</sup>  In New Orleans, Louisiana, 50 police officers have been arrested, indicted, or convicted on criminal charges ranging from murder to drug-trafficking since 1993.<sup>101</sup>  In Baltimore, Maryland, the failure to retain experienced detectives with top-level investigative skills is compromising the quality of police investigations and hampering the efforts of prosecutors. "In court, it is a loss of an experienced detective who can explain to a jury how you go through an investigation," observes U.S. Attorney Katherine J. Armentout. "They have credibility with a jury that is just invaluable."<sup>102</sup>

<b>THE CLINTON "COPS" PROGRAM</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With the enactment of the $30 billion Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, President Clinton promised to put 100,000 additional police officers on America's streets to fight violent crime. Among its many provisions, the 1994 law sets aside $8.8 billion in funding for the hiring of police officers over a six-year period. Clinton's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program, administered by a new office within the Department of Justice, gives funds to local jurisdictions, including smaller towns and larger urban areas, for "community policing" strategies.<sup>103</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Under this, grants fund local police personnel for three years, and the federal contribution is set at 75 percent of the combined salary and benefits of each officer, up to $75,000 over a three-year period. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, average starting salaries for entry level police officers today range from $18,710 to $26,560, with "average operating expenditures" for each officer ranging from $31,500 to $63,400 per annum.<sup>104</sup>  In 1995, 8,000 of the nation's approximately 15,000 law enforcement jurisdictions applied for the new federal funding; 92 percent of those which applied were approved.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There has been some confusion over the exact number of police officers hired thus far under the Clinton plan. While the 100,000 figure is used routinely in the media, Attorney General Janet Reno recently cited a far smaller number of police on the streets as a result of the new grant program: 17,000.<sup>105</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration's promise of 100,000 additional police is popular with local officials who can afford the matching contribution. But even if the promise were fulfilled, "the nation would go from having one officer on patrol at any given time for every 6,250 Americans (1.6 per 10,000) to one officer for every 5,208 Americans (1.9 per 10,000).... This 20 percent increase does not seem likely to make much difference in crime, at least under conventional theories of high visibility and rapid response time. Nor is it likely to produce the substantially higher arrest rates that some advocates argue will reduce crime."<sup>106</sup>  In addition, reported crime has been declining since 1992,<sup>107</sup> well before passage of the 1994 crime bill and well before the first cohort of newly funded officers hit the streets.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The available evidence clearly indicates that the Clinton program is poorly targeted to reduce violent crime.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a random sample of applicants conducted by the U.S. General Accounting Office, for example, 84 percent of the jurisdictions cited "property" crimes as among their "top five ranked public safety issues," followed by domestic violence (78.3 percent); alcohol-related crimes, including drunken driving (63.3 percent); drug crimes (60.9 percent); and vandalism (51.2 percent). "Violent crimes against persons" ranked only sixth (50.7 percent).<sup>108</sup>  Other "top five public safety issues" included traffic violations (3.7 percent), disorderly conduct (19.8 percent), and gangs (19.3 percent). Overall, the GAO "found no relationship between crime rates and whether an applicant jurisdiction was awarded the grant."<sup>109</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

$7.2 million in COPS grant money ended up funding 86 police officers for state parks, including 30 additional officers in Florida to "keep watch over a coral sanctuary" and 19 park rangers for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.<sup>110</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Based on an extrapolation from the GAO data, the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee found that grant funding was not going to those cities and communities hardest hit by violent crime. In Oregon, for example, Portland accounts for 56 percent of all violent crimes but received less than one percent of the state's COPS funding.<sup>111</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many local jurisdictions simply cannot afford the Clinton plan, which requires them to assume a greater portion of the cost each year of the three-year grant period. According to the GAO, almost 7,000 local jurisdictions did not apply for grants, and over 600 turned down the opportunity to participate. Based on a review of jurisdictions that did not apply, the GAO found that in 62 percent of the cases, the reason was their inability to meet the program's financial requirements.<sup>112</sup>  Other reasons included local management decisions and excessive regulatory and paperwork requirements.<sup>113</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Instead of reinforcing merit selection, the Clinton plan encourages quotas. Upon withdrawing from participation in the COPS program, Oklahoma City Police Chief Sam Gonzales observed that the Justice Department's language on the hiring of women and minorities is "very significant" because "it states 'equal employment' of women and minorities rather than 'equal employment opportunity.'"  <sup>114</sup> The program is also inflexible: "There's nothing wrong with community policing, and many cities would be glad to spend federal dollars to implement it. But others, including some large cities, already have instituted community policing and need computers instead."<sup>115</sup>

<p>
<b>BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE LOCAL POLICE FORCE</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The federal government cannot improve local police personnel management. That is a job for state and local officials and, given the demands of public safety, is one of their most important responsibilities. They must, therefore, understand the realities of police work and the kinds of standards that should be applied both in recruiting new police officers and in evaluating police performance. They cannot safely indulge racial quotas or accommodate liberal political attacks on merit principles of personnel management.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local officials also must pay police officers for the job they do; they cannot expect to have a first-rate police department with bargain-basement pay scales or lowered mental and physical standards. The federal government cannot make police officers effective in their communities simply by throwing more money at the problem. At the same time, however, imaginative local officials have demonstrated some dramatic successes.
<blockquote>
	<b>New York City:</b> Taking over a demoralized 38,000-member department in 1994, William J. Bratton declared an all-out war on crime and disorder to reclaim neighborhoods literally block by block. Commissioner Bratton started decentralizing authority, tracked crime trends through a computerized system, and held commanders directly accountable for decreasing crime and disorder in their precincts. He also dismissed high-level police officials who were unable or unwilling to adapt to the new program.<sup>116</sup>  The result: In 1994, major felonies fell by 2 percent nationwide; in New York City, they dropped by 12 percent in 1994 and fell by another 18 percent in the first nine months of 1995.<sup>117</sup>  This dramatic reduction in major felonies over three years also included an almost 45 percent drop in the murder rate.
<p>
	<b>Houston, Texas:</b> In a remarkable experiment in community policing, Houston Police Chief Sam Nuchia started an innovative "citizens patrol program" to supplement the work of the city's police force. The result: Thousands of citizen patrollers have reported criminal activities to the police, arrests have increased, and police productivity has improved.<sup>118</sup>
<p>
	<b>Oxnard, California:</b> Using a sophisticated crime analysis and advanced gang-tracking computer data base developed by a team of experts during the Reagan Administration, police have been able to issue crime alerts to residents in high-crime areas and to target juvenile offenders effectively. The result: violent crime has fallen by 38 percent to its lowest level since the 1960s.<sup>119</sup>  Similar computerized identification and tracking techniques are being used in 130 other jurisdictions.
<p>
	<b>Charleston, South Carolina:</b> Police Chief Reuben Greenberg, widely known for innovative police management, concentrated his efforts on combatting the high level of crime and disorder in the city's public housing projects. Working directly with public housing tenants, Greenberg and his officers helped them screen prospective tenants for criminal records;, tenants engaged in illegal behavior, including drug trafficking, were evicted. The result: Charleston's public housing projects were transformed from one of the most dangerous places in Charleston to one of the "safest."<sup>120</sup>

<b>THE NEED FOR LOCAL LEADERSHIP</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the final analysis, the principal problems facing the police today are personnel management and how best to utilize the limited resources available to maintain order and enforce the law. To address these problems, state and local officials should:<ol>

<p><li><b>Get serious about personnel standards.</b> The police officer's job is unique; there is nothing comparable to it in the private sector. Many experts like former New York City Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy therefore favor a four-year college degree, or at least a higher education requirement, as an ideal standard.<sup>121</sup>  Other experts do not see a college or university degree as a necessary condition of appointment, and argue that for persons with demonstrated maturity and diverse life experiences, a high school degree or equivalent may suffice.<sup>122</sup>
<p>
No matter what educational standards they adopt, responsible officials should use standardized tests as an initial screening mechanism to evaluate the cognitive ability of recruits. For patrol officers charged with keeping order on the streets, psychological evaluations and the ability to meet serious physical requirements, measured in physical strength and stamina, are also essential. Most important, background investigations of recruits must include serious inquiries into their past behavior, their reputation for honesty and integrity, their current and past associations, and their financial and marital stability, as well as any evidence of illegal drug use or alcohol abuse.<sup>123</sup>  Periodic re-investigations of personnel, particularly those assigned to specialized tasks such as drug enforcement, also are desirable. Continuing vigilance concerning the character and integrity of the police force is the best defense against the perennial threat of corruption.

<p><li><b>Improve the image of the police.</b> The image of the police officer on the street means a lot: "Cops deserve smart looking uniforms -- and should wear them smartly -- because they represent both the city and the profession."<sup>124</sup>  A police officer's personal appearance and demeanor can help instill respect and confidence among members of the community by creating an image of competence and strength. This is what taxpayers want in their police officers, and it is what they deserve.

<P><li><b>Draw recruits from every sector of the community.</b> Because the mission of the police is of vital concern to every citizen, the police department should represent the community and reflect its demographic composition. Such broader representation is particularly important in minority neighborhoods so that officers can understand the prevailing subculture, prevent and control community disorder, and elicit critical information vital to effective law enforcement. Local officials have a genuine public interest in making their police officers role models and champions of the local community.
<p>
This means that they should cast a wide net and recruit aggressively from every sector of the community. But they should not be deceived by the false god of "diversity at all costs" or by the politically correct premise that simple numerical "underrepresentation" is proof of racial or ethnic discrimination. Nor should they adopt race-based deployment, with only white cops in "white communities" and only black cops in "black communities."<sup>125</sup>  And in no case should personnel management policy make a mockery of merit selection or promotion: "When individual performance is undervalued, professional standards are bound to decline."<sup>126</sup>  Finally, while officials should draw police recruits from the minority community, they should not make membership in the community a condition of appointment: "It is easier to teach police about an area and its residents than to make good police from unqualified applicants."<sup>127</sup>

<p><li><b>Draw recruits from the military.</b> The United States Army recruitment motto "Be all that you can be" applies with equal force to the police. While military and police functions are fundamentally different, and good police work is often the product of an entrepreneurial spirit, military personnel have served in a disciplined organization and are trained in many skills that are useful in police work, including the use of firearms. Veterans preference in recruitment and hiring is being used in many departments, but officials should go further and actively recruit candidates from the military, a talent pool distinguished by high standards of performance. Moreover, for officials wishing to increase the number of minorities serving on the police force, they should realize that blacks make up 11.5 percent of America's civilian population between the ages of 18 and 44 but represent almost 30 percent of the American military, including a large number of senior officers, particularly in the Army: "The military is not free of racial problems found in the civilian world, but it has been more insulated from them because it is a closed and hierarchical society where rank is more important than race or gender."<sup>128</sup>

<p><li><b>Anchor the police in the community.</b> The most effective police officer is not an outsider, but an insider; and the best way to establish effective "community policing" is for local residents to know the police and the police to know the local residents. Foot patrols should be established wherever feasible; the more people the police officer knows, the more effective he will be not only in maintaining order and enforcing community standards, but also in obtaining the sort of solid information that is essential in controlling crime.
<p>
A police officer must get to know the community and its residents and be ready to share information with other officers patrolling the area. If the police officer and his family live in the community, policing becomes more than simply a job; it becomes a matter of protecting one's friends and neighbors. In order to integrate police officers into the community, local officials should consider low-cost housing loans or housing vouchers to enable officers to move into the neighborhoods where they are needed. "The residency requirement is not very effective right now," says Hubert Williams, President of the Police Foundation. "We simply need another approach and police homeownership in high risk or deteriorating neighborhoods is proving to be a successful solution."<sup>129</sup>

<p><li><b>Modernize police management.</b> Too often, police management practices are outdated and do not work.<sup>129</sup>  Bureaucratic civil service rules and regulations and outdated labor/management models impede managerial flexibility and undercut accountability and performance. For example, officers appointed to the detective division should serve on a probationary basis to demonstrate their skills and commitment, just as physicians serve internships. Too often, also, there is little lateral entry into managerial ranks from outside the force. The police force is one of the few organizational cultures in which promotion is almost exclusively through the ranks. Success in the ranks, however, usually depends on responding to incidents, not on strategic planning.<sup>131</sup>  Strategic use of resources, which includes analyzing crime and devising of long-term and short-term solutions, requires an effective planning and research capability to support police management. But less than 1 percent of police budgets are dedicated to research,<sup>132</sup> and planning often is not coordinated effectively with operations leadership.
<p>
Sound personnel management is based on clarity of mission, direct accountability of line management and staff to see that goals are met, and reward for performance. While police work is hardly comparable to anything in the private sector, "Police executives must continually review private sector approaches to managing, developing and supporting people, and transport ideas into the public sector where applicable."<sup>133</sup>
<p>
Commissioner Bratton's success in New York City is partially attributable to the clarity of his goals: "`I don't want a 2 or 3 percent reduction in crime this year -- I want 15 to 25 percent.'  And he got it."<sup>134</sup>  He also devolved authority downward to police commanders in the field, holding them directly accountable for the maintenance of law and order in their jurisdictions and carefully measuring their success and the success of the officers working under their command: "We gave these first line managers the authority to run their precincts as miniature police departments without a lot of petty interference from headquarters. The best ones rose to this opportunity with enthusiasm and creativity."  <sup>135</sup> Commanders must know their precincts, take personal responsibility for conditions there, and respond quickly and effectively to the needs of the community: "As many private sector organizations have discovered, the further from the point of service delivery, the harder it is to make good decisions without good information."<sup>136</sup> 
<p>
<p><li><b>Use sound personnel management to combat police corruption.</b> Conventional wisdom holds that if an officer stays too long on one beat, he may become subject to corruption, particularly by organized crime syndicates. Police corruption can be met in two ways: through serious background investigations, particularly investigations into moral character, and through sound management practices that make commanders directly accountable for the integrity, as well as the performance, of their people. Everyone in the department, from the top executives down through the ranks, must accept responsibility for the integrity of the force: "Few actions erode the confidence of the public or of the police in their own department as much as the indifference of command officers to misconduct by their personnel."<sup>137</sup>  In New York City Commissioner Bratton adopted a highly public strategy of going out and personally arresting corrupt policemen, disgracing them by taking their badges from them for violating their oaths.
<p>
If commanders have to answer for a breakdown in the system's integrity, they also are more likely to ensure both the periodic background investigation of personnel assigned to sensitive details, such as narcotics or organized crime investigations where the temptations of corruption are higher, and the periodic rotation of personnel in such assignments. Police officials, in effect, should impose "term limits" on assignments to such highly sensitive investigative squads.

<p><li><b>Target hot spots.</b> Modern techniques for tracking crime give police officials an opportunity to anticipate and intervene quickly and effectively in high crime areas: "By plotting each homicide incident and using sophisticated mapping and statistical clustering procedures, the early warning system allows police to identify potential neighborhood crisis areas at high risk for suffering a spurt of gang violence. With rapid dissemination of information, police can intervene in hot spots to quell emerging trouble."<sup>138</sup>  Such intervention also can serve to disrupt the trade in illegal narcotics. "The key to making crackdowns work is to keep them short and unpredictable," advises Professor Lawrence Sherman. "Long-term police crackdowns all show a 'decay' in their deterrent effects over time. Short term crackdowns, in contrast, show a free bonus of residual deterrence after the crackdown stops, while potential offenders slowly figure out that the cops are gone."<sup>139</sup>  In Minneapolis, a controlled experiment in "hot spots" interventions in 1988 and 1989 resulted in a 50 percent decline in disorder, including neighborhood fights and other disturbances.<sup>140</sup>

<p><li><b>Target the criminal class and their guns.</b> The population engaged in the most serious crime is relatively small, composed generally of serious habitual offenders, often on probation and parole. They should be a routine target of the police. State lawmakers, for example, can enact laws which make all persons on probation and parole subject to "non-consensual" search for guns or other weapons as a condition of probation or parole.<sup>141</sup>  Stopping and frisking such persons, especially in hot spot areas, is an innovative way to combat gun violence.<sup>142</sup>  Local police officials also can create specialized units that "combine surveillance and sting strategies to catch the offender in the act of crime. The resulting evidence is stronger than arrests made after the fact, thus increasing the odds of the offender being imprisoned."<sup>143</sup>  Finally, as Craig Fraser of the Police Executive Research Forum has suggested, state officials should appoint police chiefs to parole and probation panels, giving them a direct role in the official decision to put prisoners back on the streets.

<p><li><b>Civilianize and privatize administrative and support functions.</b> Too many police officers are tied up with administrative, logistical, and other support duties. Officials should review positions held by police personnel to determine whether the job requires a sworn officer. Where possible, civilians should carry out ancillary administrative functions. Santa Clara, California, for example, established a system of community service officers -- personnel who are not armed and who can conduct traffic accident assistance and investigations, file reports, and serve in school crossing and traffic positions. Community service personnel also can serve as a good pool for recruitment into the regular police ranks.
<p>
Local officials also should consider the privatization of ancillary police services. Most police departments, for example, have a large fleet of automobiles that must be maintained; keeping police cruisers in top condition need not require police personnel, but could be contracted out to private bidders. Privatization is a healthy and growing challenge to police management generally: "Venture capitalists are now exploring the concept of policing corporations which provide policing services to contract cities."<sup>144</sup>

<p><li><b>Reduce the caseloads of detectives.</b> In many urban areas, the caseload for detectives is too high. This problem could be eased by training patrol officers to conduct the early stages of investigations, including the interrogations of witnesses and suspects at or near crime scenes. In order to gain the confidence of detectives on the force, experienced or retired detectives could be used for such training. In the investigation of certain crimes, specially trained officers easily can take over interviewing responsibilities normally reserved for detectives, especially in sensitive areas such as rape or child molestation.<sup>145</sup> 
<p>
Careful interviewing and questioning of informants, witnesses, and suspects is the key to resolving difficult cases. Officials therefore should thoroughly debrief retiring detectives before they leave the force to gather as much information as possible about their investigative techniques, experiences, and other tricks of the trade. Retiring detectives also should transmit to police intelligence units, consistent with respect for confidentiality and the sensitivity of the information, the names of good informants, contacts in the underworld, or other crucial sources of information.

<p><li><b>Improve police compensation.</b> "Bargain basement cops" invariably turn out to be expensive, especially in terms of morale and lost public confidence. Policing must be a desirable middle-class occupation. This means regularly reviewing police pay to make sure that it attracts the best candidates to the force. Officials also should consider pay for performance, at least for police managers,<sup>146</sup> as well as bonuses for officers assigned to dangerous or sensitive investigations. Monies secured from "drug busts," for example, could be used not only for drug rehabilitation and treatment, but also for bonuses for police officers temporarily assigned to narcotics investigations, undercover work, or other dangerous assignments. Nor should local officials neglect other forms of compensation: "Educational incentives, patrol bonuses, watch differentials and alternative work schedules are methods to improve the quality of service delivered and the job satisfaction of line personnel."<sup>147</sup> 

<p><li><b>Use advanced technology.</b> Modern, time-saving equipment can magnify the effectiveness of well-trained police officers. The concept of "working smarter, not harder" is particularly appropriate to police work and can free up the officer's time to maintain the neighborhood contacts vital to community policing. Lap-top computers can speed up the process of report writing and improve the legibility of field reports, making it unnecessary to write out the same information numerous times in order to complete the crime reports, arrest reports, property reports, witness lists, and other paperwork needed to record police incidents.
<p>
Some departments are using innovative electronic information systems to streamline the process of reporting and analysis. In St. Petersburg, Florida, for example, the police are experimenting with electronic docking mechanisms in patrol cars which would allow officers to use computers to receive and transmit information through the police radio system. This would allow all crime incident record keeping processes -- from the original taking of a telephone complaint, through the patrol officer's response and preliminary investigation, to the follow-up investigation by detectives -- to be automated. The resulting improvements in productivity, timeliness, and accuracy would provide multiple benefits both for the police department itself and for the citizens who rely on its services.
<p>
Other advanced electronic devices, such as cellular telephones and facsimile transmission equipment, can enhance patrol officers' ability to communicate while minimizing their time away from the neighborhoods they serve. Automated fingerprint identification systems greatly improve criminal investigations and the apprehension of suspects. Closed-circuit television has many uses, from "line ups" identification to traffic surveillance and physical location security. Advanced simulation technology and computer-generated audio-visual equipment can provide "virtual reality" in police training and increase the accuracy of officer evaluations.
<p>
Even though many municipalities may find it difficult to provide funding for the major capital expenditures necessary to obtain such equipment, they should make a special effort in this direction as a way to improve public safety. Special law enforcement bond issues, private sector contributions, or other innovative means of financing could be used. Likewise, if Congress wants to provide federal funds to local law enforcement, it would be far wiser to make those funds available for capital expenditures on technological improvements which provide long-term value<sup>148</sup> instead of simply paying part of the costs of local police operating expenses, which offer only temporary and limited benefits.
</ol><p><b>
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

State and local officials bear the primary responsibility for combatting most crime, especially street crime. Nevertheless, both Congress and the executive branch can play a supporting role. Among the 15,000 law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States, the challenges to law enforcement are as different as the communities they serve. Therefore, any federal assistance should ensure maximum flexibility for state and local officials in fighting crime in their communities. Specifically, Congress should:<ul>

<p><li><b>Block the appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity to public safety.</b> The United States Senate has the constitutional responsibility to give its advice and consent to the appointment of federal judicial nominees. A number of liberal judges appointed to the bench have issued creative rulings to advance the rights of criminal suspects, even to the point of embarrassing the Presidents who appointed them. The Senate should scrutinize judicial candidates more carefully, rely more heavily on the formal advice and testimony of police representatives in the confirmation process, and block the appointment of nominees with records of insensitivity to public safety.

<p><li><b>Review all federal statutes dealing with crime, identify those which impinge on the legitimate authority of local and state law enforcement officials, and repeal them.</b> Currently, there are more than 3,000 federal crime laws on the statute books: "Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities. Federal crimes now range from serious but purely local crimes like carjacking and drug dealing to trivial crimes like disrupting a rodeo."<sup>149</sup>  The Clinton Administration's 1994 crime bill added two dozen more federal crimes, duplicating offenses already illegal under state and local statutes. Congress should begin to reverse this counterproductive trend toward the federalization of crime -- a process that has been promoted by representatives of both political parties.

<p><li><b>Reform the exclusionary rule.</b> A "good faith" exception to the exclusionary rule would enable prosecutors to introduce incriminating evidence at trial which has been gathered in good faith but otherwise would be ruled inadmissible because of technical violations of procedure by police officers. A process also should be established to discipline officers who abuse proper procedure. As currently formulated, the exclusionary rule suppresses good evidence, causes good arrests to be thrown out, and contributes to the demoralization of the police. This problem is aggravated by tortured interpretations of the law by liberal judges: "If an officer stops a car without adequate reason and finds the butt of a marijuana cigarette on the floor," for example, "there is little public concern when the offense goes unpunished. But if the officer finds a gun that proves the driver committed a murder, the suppression of the gun may set a killer free and outrage the public. The officer's conduct in both cases is the same, but the consequences to the public vary drastically."<sup>150</sup>  A congressionally enacted good faith exception to the exclusionary rule for federal jurisdictions also could encourage state legislatures to enact similar statutes affecting local jurisdictions.

<p><li><b>Review the impact of the Miranda ruling.</b> For three decades, police officers have been operating under the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> requiring officers to inform suspects of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney. Statements made by suspects can be excluded as evidence if the technical rules are not followed precisely. Congress should revisit this ruling to determine its impact on the ability of prosecutors to achieve justice in criminal cases. Professor Paul G. Cassell of the University of Utah College of Law, for example, argues that <I>Miranda</I>, at least as currently enforced, is responsible for thousands of lost criminal cases.<sup>151</sup>  Congress should conduct hearings and enact remedies for any deficiencies in the application of <I>Miranda</I> rules, including an alternative to the exclusion of valid probative evidence.

<p><li><b>Make federal funding of local law enforcement user friendly.</b> Neither federal programs nor increases in federal anti-crime spending have had much impact in reducing violent crime at the local level, and early indications are that President Clinton's multibillion dollar COPS program will follow this pattern. If Congress wants to help state and local officials, it should break away from outdated and ineffective patterns of federal spending.
<p>
Under an innovative proposal by Representative F. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI), for example, 2 percent of the federal personal income tax taken from the residents of each state would be returned to the state to fight crime. These tax rebates would be free of the federal intrusions that accompany categorical grants and would allow state officials to use the money for their specific needs, such as police staffing and equipment, community policing, crime prevention, or prison programs. These rebates would amount to $55 billion over a five-year period, a steady stream of funding both more flexible and more generous than that contained in the Clinton Administration's crime bill.<sup>152</sup>  The tax rebate strategy also has the advantage of creating strong incentives for local officials to spend the money wisely, targeting what is necessary rather than what is merely desirable. The reason: Under the Sensenbrenner proposal, state officials also would have the option of giving money back to the taxpayers directly in the form of tax cuts. 

<p><li><b>Review D.C. police pay and personnel management practices.</b> Since Congress in the late 1980s and early 1990s contributed directly to the problems of the police in the nation's capital, it should work cooperatively with local officials to make the D.C. police force the national model it once was. This includes reviewing pay and personnel management practices, particularly the recruiting and hiring of police officers. Washington Police Chief Larry Soulsby already has embarked on a comprehensive retraining program for 2,700 officers, nearly 75 percent of the force. This retraining covers everything from ethics and criminal procedures to street tactics and the preparation of police reports, a critical subject since "Unclear or misleading statements in those documents can jeopardize prosecution of criminal cases."<sup>153</sup>

<p><li><b>Pursue an innovative empowerment strategy to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods plagued by crime and disorder.</b> Over the past 40 years, Congress has enacted numerous social programs aimed at crime "prevention," including federal programs for "at risk" and delinquent youth. The General Accounting Office recently identified 131 such overlapping federal programs for "at risk" youth alone, administered by 16 federal agencies at an annual cost of over $4 billion.<sup>154</sup>
<p>
Innovative community policing strategies should be combined with imaginative new social policies. Representatives James Talent (R-MO) and J. C. Watts (R-OK), for example, are sponsoring Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467). This comprehensive initiative would establish a new federal policy to empower parents and neighborhood organizations, such as black churches and other religious institutions, to educate children trapped in poorly performing inner-city schools, in addition to encouraging faith-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation and other private social service programs that work.<sup>155</sup>  Dr. Richard Freeman of Harvard University has found that black inner-city youth who have religious values are 54 percent less likely to use drugs and 50 percent less likely to engage in criminal activities than those without religious values.<sup>156</sup>
<p>
One final recommendation applies specifically to the executive branch: 
<p><li><b>Improve the sharing of information with state and local officials.</b> In carrying out their constitutional responsibilities to combat interstate and international crime, as well as to control United States borders, federal law enforcement agencies should maximize their coordination and cooperation with state and local police. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in particular can provide valuable technical assistance and training, specialized support in the fields of identification and scientific investigation, and central facilities for the collection and dissemination of statistical data, criminal intelligence, and other relevant information on a national basis.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

No American family is safe from the threat of crime. In some inner-city neighborhoods, the situation is positively desperate. And with the rising tide of violent juvenile crime, millions of Americans will be locked behind their doors, imprisoned in their own homes in deteriorating neighborhoods. In far too many urban areas, law-abiding citizens cannot go to the store, take a stroll in the park, or even visit friends and relatives without fear of violent assault. These people need the best police protection they can get. It is the job of state and local officials to give it to them.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To do this, they must get serious about the mission of the police and expand their use of the kinds of personnel management principles that can attract and hold first-rate police officers. This includes setting and maintaining high standards for appointment; drawing from every sector of the community; drawing from the military, particularly to broaden minority representation; aggressively targeting both hot spots and the criminal class; anchoring police officers in the community; modernizing police management and privatizing and civilianizing support functions wherever possible; and improving police compensation.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress can play a supportive role in this drama, but not a definitive one. This means repealing federal laws which impede the ability of local police to enforce the law. Specifically, Congress should reformulate the exclusionary rule to allow the inclusion of evidence gathered in good faith by police officers; review the impact of <I>Miranda</I> on police criminal investigations; stop the appointment of lenient federal judges; and change the funding formulas for federal financial assistance to the states, replacing the current grant-in-aid system with a more generous tax rebate that allows state and local officials maximum flexibility to combat violent crime.

   <p><li> Under the 1996 Prison Litigation Reform Act, Congress has restricted federal judicial control over state prison systems. The new law limits court-ordered relief in suits challenging prison conditions; only specific violations of an inmate's constitutional rights now qualify for relief. Furthermore, the court must consider whether its remedy would harm public safety. The new law also restricts court-ordered prison population caps by requiring a court finding that overcrowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's constitutional rights.

In the evaluation of social programs, especially those conducted by the General Accounting Office, Congress should order the study of success, not just the many federal programs that don't work.
<p><li>    The problem is long-standing: "The police feel that they deserve respect from the public. But the upper class looks down on them; the middle class seems to ignore them, as if they were part of the urban scenery; the lower class fears them." Arthur Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield: The Police in Urban Society</I> (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday and Company, 1967), p. 9. The literature on the police and public policy is rich and growing. While chronologically dated, Niederhoff's work and James Q. Wilson's <I>Varieties of Police Behavior: The Management of Law and Order in Eight Communities</I> (New York, N.Y.: Atheneum Press, 1970) are foundational. See also J. S. Skolnick, <I>Justice Without Trial: Law Enforcement in a Democratic Society</I> (New York, N.Y.: John Wiley and Sons, 1966).
  <p><li>  Fully 91 percent of New York City police officers responding to a recent survey felt that the public has little understanding of police problems. Kelling, "How to Run a Police Department," p. 37.
   <p><li> "The patroleman is neither a bureaucrat nor a professional, but a member of a craft. As with most crafts, his has no body of generalized written knowledge nor a set of detailed prescriptions as to how to behave. It has in short, neither theory nor rules. Learning the craft is by apprenticeship, but on the job and not in the academy." Wilson, <I>Varieties of Police Behavior</I>, p. 283.

Culturally, these standards appear light-years away from personal behavior that would be ignored or even approved today.

In an older extensive study covering the period 1950-1965, the average number of suicides in the general New York City population for males was 15 per 100,000, but the average police rate was 22.7 per 100,000, a rate substantially higher than the general population.

   <p><li> Commenting on the professional culture of the famed New York City detective division in the 1950s and 1960s, Arthur Niederhoff, a former New York City policeman, observes that "Detectives are the upper class of police society and haughtily guard their special status and privileges. Their quarters are separate from those of the uniformed police. Within this private domain democratic camaraderie eliminates the social distance that ordinarily divides the various ranks of a bureaucratic hierarchy.... It is of special significance that this high status unit, to which every member of the lower echelon aspires, performs best when disregarding formal regulations and official procedures." Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield</I>, pp. 83-85.
 <p><li>   The Supreme Court qualified its <i>Miranda </i>ruling in <I>Harris v. New York</I> (1971), ruling that if an accused person makes statements on the witness stand that differ from statements made to the police, the prosecution can introduce the earlier statements into the record for purposes of discrediting the testimony of the accused.
<p><li>    See Paul Cassell, <I>Reforming Miranda: A Proposal for Congressional Action,</I> College of Law, University of Utah, 1994.
 <p><li>   "A good detective must be suspicious; he needs the intuitive ability to sense plots and conspiracies on the basis of embryonic evidence," says Niederhoff, but the qualifications are hard to establish: "A strong minority on the [New York] police force asserts... that a detective's value and future success depends on the private sources of information at his disposal, and his willingness to do the necessary legwork. They support this opinion by citing the many brilliant detectives in police history who could never have passed an IQ test, could hardly write an intelligible report, and whose techniques of investigation violated every recommended principle of scientific detection."

  <p><li>  "Incidents that would cause commotion and consternation in quiet precincts seem so common in ghetto neighborhoods that they are often not reported. The police rationalize this avoidance of duty with theories that the victim would refuse to prosecute because violence has become the accepted way of life for his community, and that any other course would result in a great loss of time in court, which would reduce the efficiency of other police functions."

  <p><li>  "This doctrine encourages an observer from one culture to respect the integrity of another, although its standards of behavior may be different from his own. The implication is that the policeman has some justification for accepting a minority group's way of life on its own terms, and thus for acting the way he does. There is no easy answer to this paradox." Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield</I>, p. 66.
  <p><li>  Professor Butler's basic argument is that since the United States is "structurally" racist, blacks are victimized by the American system, and black jurors have, therefore, no obligation to up hold its system of justice, at least as applied to blacks who commit non-violent crimes.

<p><li>     Craig Fraser of the Police Executive Research Forum, for example, argues that 21- or 22-year-old college graduates may test well and have outstanding academic records, but they frequently have little or no exposure to life outside a college setting. Having been dependent on parental authority and institutional settings throughout their late teens and early twenties, such persons would be struggling as police officers, not only in using discretion on the street, but also in trying to live on their own. Interview with Craig Fraser, November 17, 1994.

<h3>THE REAL ROOT CAUSES OF VIOLENT CRIME:<br>
The Breakdown of Marriage, Family, and Community</h3>

<B> INTRODUCTION</B><P>
     Policymakers at last are coming to recognize the connection between
the breakdown of American families and various social problems.  The
unfolding debate over welfare reform, for instance, has been shaped by the
wide acceptance in recent years that children born into single-parent families
are much more likely than children of intact families to fall into poverty and
welfare dependence themselves in later years.  These children, in fact, face
a daunting array of problems.
<P>
     While this link between illegitimacy and chronic welfare dependency
now is better understood, policymakers also need to appreciate another
strong and disturbing pattern evident in scholarly studies:  the link between 
illegitimacy and violent crime and between the lack of parental attachment
and violent crime.  Without an understanding of the root causes of criminal
behavior -- how criminals are formed -- Members of Congress and state
legislators cannot understand why whole sectors of society, particularly in
urban areas, are being torn apart by crime.  And without that knowledge,
sound policymaking is impossible.
<P>
          A review of the empirical evidence in the professional
literature of the social sciences gives policymakers an insight into the root
causes of crime.  Consider, for instance:
<P>
Over the past thirty years, the rise in violent crime parallels the rise in
families abandoned by fathers.
<P>
High-crime neighborhoods are characterized by high concentrations of
families abandoned by fathers.
<P>
State-by-state analysis by Heritage scholars indicates that a 10 percent
increase in the percentage of children living in single-parent homes leads
typically to a 17 percent increase in juvenile crime.
<P>
The rate of violent teenage crime corresponds with the number of families
abandoned by fathers.
<P>
The type of aggression and hostility demonstrated by a future criminal often
is foreshadowed in unusual aggressiveness as early as age five or six.
<P>
The future criminal tends to be an individual rejected by other children as
early as the first grade who goes on to form his own group of friends, often
the future delinquent gang.
<P>
On the other hand: 
<P>
Neighborhoods with a high degree of religious practice are not high-crime
neighborhoods.
<P>
Even in high-crime inner-city neighborhoods, well over 90 percent of
children from safe, stable homes do not become delinquents.  By contrast
only 10 percent of children from unsafe, unstable homes in these
neighborhoods avoid crime.
<P>
Criminals capable of sustaining marriage gradually move away from a life
of crime after they get married.
<P>
The mother's strong affectionate attachment to her child is the child's best
buffer against a life of crime.
<P>
The father's authority and involvement in raising his children are also a
great buffer against a life of crime.
<P>
     The scholarly evidence, in short, suggests that at the heart of the
explosion of crime in America is the loss of the capacity of fathers and
mothers to be responsible in caring for the children they bring into the
world.  This loss of love and guidance at the intimate levels of marriage and
family has broad social consequences for children and for the wider
community.  The empirical evidence shows that too many young men and
women from broken families tend to have a much weaker sense of
connection with their neighborhood and are prone to exploit its members to
satisfy their unmet needs or desires.  This contributes to a loss of a sense
of community and to the disintegration of neighborhoods into social chaos
and violent crime.  If policymakers are to deal with the root causes of
crime, therefore, they must deal with the rapid rise of illegitimacy.
     
     <P>     

<B> OFFICIAL WASHINGTON'S VIEW OF CRIME </B><P>
     The professional literature in criminology is quite at odds with
orthodox thinking in official Washington.  Many lawmakers in Congress and
in the states assume that the high level of crime in America must have its
roots in material conditions, such as poor employment opportunities and a
shortage of adequately funded social programs.  But Members of Congress
and other policymakers cannot understand the root causes of crime if they
insist on viewing it purely in material terms.  This view blinds policymakers
to the personal aspects of crime, including moral failure, the refusal to
exercise personal responsibility, and the inability or refusal to enter into
family and community relationships based on love, respect, and attachment
both to the broader community and to a common code of conduct.
<P>
          The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of
1994, supported by the Clinton Administration and enacted last year,
perfectly embodies official Washington's thinking about crime.  It provides
for billions of dollars in new spending, adding 15 new social programs on
top of a welfare system that has cost taxpayers $5 trillion since the "War on
Poverty" was declared in 1965.  There is no reason to suppose the
programs will have any significant effect.  Since 1965, welfare spending has
increased 800 percent in real terms, while the number of major felonies per
capita today is roughly three times the rate before 1960.  As Senator Phil
Gramm (R-TX) says, "If social spending stopped crime we would be the
safest country in the world."
<P>
          Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE), former chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee and a major sponsor of the recent crime bill, summed
up the predominant view of crime prevention:  "These [social services] are
all good programs.  They are all designed to do the same thing -- give these
kids something to say yes to."  Likewise, the Department of Justice's report,
"Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent and Chronic Juvenile
Offenders," accurately diagnoses the roots of the problem (in terms of
family, religion, and moral formation), but then recommends a long list of
new federal social programs on top of the current programs.
      <P>
           But the conventional assumptions about the root causes of
crime -- and thus the solutions -- are wide of the mark:
<P>
<B> Poverty and Unemployment </B>
<P>
     The central proposition in official Washington's thinking about crime
is that poverty is the primary cause of crime.  In its simplest form, this
contention is absurd; if it were true, there would have been more crime in
the past, when more people were poorer.  And in poorer nations, the crime
rates would be higher than in the United States.  More significantly, history
defies the assumption that deteriorating economic circumstances breed crime
(and improving conditions reduce it).  Instead, America's crime rate
gradually rose during the long period of real economic growth:  1905 to
1933.  As the Great Depression set in and incomes dropped, the crime rate
also dropped.  It rose again between 1965 and 1974 when incomes rose
steadily.  Most recently, during the recession of 1982, there was a slight dip
in crime, not an increase.
<P>
          What is true of the general population is also true of black
Americans.  For example, between 1950 and 1974 black income in
Philadelphia almost doubled, and homicides more than doubled.  Even the
Reverend Jesse Jackson, whose prescriptions for social reform mirror
conventional liberal ideology, admits that black-on-black homicide is not an
issue of poverty.  The crime rate in other communities also shows no link
between low incomes and crime.  The Chinese in San Francisco in the mid-
1960s, for instance, had the lowest family income of any ethnic group (less
than $4,000 per year) but next to no crime:  only 5 Chinese in all of
California were then in prison.
<P>
<B> Race and Crime </B>
<P>
     There is a widespread belief that race is a major explanatory cause
of crime.  This belief is anchored in the large disparity in crime rates
between whites and blacks.  However, a closer look at the data shows that
the real variable is not race but family structure and all that it implies in
commitment and love between adults.  The incidence of broken families is
much higher in the black community.  Douglas Smith and G.  Roger
Jarjoura, in a major 1988 study of 11,000 individuals, found that "the
percentage of single-parent households with children between the ages of 12
and 20 is significantly associated with rates of violent crime and burglary." 
The same study makes clear that the widespread popular assumption that
there is an association between race and crime is false.  Illegitimacy is the
key factor.  It is the absence of marriage, and the failure to form and
maintain intact families, that explains the incidence of high crime in a
neighborhood among whites as well as blacks.  This contradicts
conventional wisdom.
     <P>
          Bolstering the Smith-Jarjoura study, University of Illinois
sociologist Robert J.  Sampson, in a study on the differential effects of
poverty and family disruption on crime, states:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Overall the analysis shows that rates of black violent
     offending, especially by juveniles, are strongly influenced by
     variations in family structure.  Independent of the major
     candidates supplied by prior criminological theory (e.g. 
     income, region, size, density, age and race composition)
     black family disruption has the largest effects on black
     juvenile robbery and homicide.... The effects of family
     structure are strong and cannot be easily dismissed by
     reference to other structural and cultural features of urban
     environments.... The effect of family disruption on black
     violence is not due to the effect of black violence on family
     structure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Sampson adds:  "the predictors of white robbery are in large part
identical in sign and magnitude to those for blacks."
<P>
<B> HOW CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR DEVELOPS </B>
<P>
     Propensity to crime develops in stages associated with major
psychological and sociological factors.  The factors are not caused by race
or poverty, and the stages are the normal tasks of growing up that every
child confronts as he gets older.  In the case of future violent criminals these
tasks, in the absence of the love, affection, and dedication of both his
parents, become perverse exercises, frustrating his needs and stunting his
ability to belong.
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The stages are: </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Early infancy and the development of the capacity for empathy.
Early family life and the development of relationships based on agreements
being kept and a sense of an intimate place where he belongs.
Early school life and the development of peer relationships based on
cooperation and agreements conveying a sense of a community to which he
belongs.
<P>
Mid-childhood and the experience of a growing capacity to learn and
cooperate within his community.
<P>
Adolescence and the need to belong as an adult and to perform. 
<P>
 Generativity, or the begetting of the next generation through intimate sexual
union and bringing others into the family and the community.
<P>
     In all of these stages the lack of dedication and the atmosphere of
rejection or conflict within the family diminish the child's experience of his
personal life as one of love, dedication, and a place to belong.  Instead, it
is characterized increasingly by rejection, abandonment, conflict, isolation,
and even abuse.  He is compelled to seek a place to belong outside of such
a home and, most frequently not finding it in the ordinary community, finds
it among others who have experienced similar rejection.  He becomes
attached to those who are alienated, for, like him, they have been rejected. 
Not finding acceptance and nurturance from caring adults, they begin
conveying their own form of acceptance.
<P>
<B> STAGE ONE:  THE BROKEN FAMILY </B>
<P>
     The evidence of the professional literature is overwhelming:  teenage
criminal behavior has its roots in habitual deprivation of parental love and
affection going back to early infancy.  Future delinquents invariably have
a chaotic, disintegrating family life.  This frequently leads to aggression and
hostility toward others outside the family.  Most delinquents are not
withdrawn or depressed.  Quite the opposite:  they are actively involved in
their neighborhood, but often in a violent fashion.  This hostility is
established in the first few years of life.  By age six, habits of aggression
and free-floating anger typically are already formed.  By way of contrast,
normal children enjoy a sense of personal security derived from their natural
attachment to their mother.  The future criminal is often denied that natural
attachment.
<P>
          The relationship between parents, not just the relationship
between mother and child, has a powerful effect on very young children. 
Children react to quarreling parents by disobeying, crying, hitting other
children, and in general being much more antisocial than their peers. 
And, significantly, quarreling or abusive parents do not generally vent their
anger equally on all their children.  Such parents tend to vent their anger on
their more difficult children.  This parental hostility and physical and
emotional abuse of the child shapes the future delinquent.
<P>
          Most delinquents are children who have been abandoned by
their fathers.  They are often deprived also of the love and affection they
need from their mother.  Inconsistent parenting, family turmoil, and
multiple other stresses (such as economic hardship and psychiatric
illnesses) that flow from these disagreements compound the rejection of
these children by these parents, many of whom became criminals during
childhood.  With all these factors working against the child's normal
development, by age five the future criminal already will tend to be
aggressive, hostile, and hyperactive.  Four-fifths of children destined to be
criminals will be "antisocial" by 11 years of age, and fully two-thirds of
antisocial five-year-olds will be delinquent by age 15. 
<P>
           Summing up the findings of the professional literature on
juvenile delinquency, Kevin Wright, professor of criminal justice at the State
University of New York at Binghamton, writes:  "Research confirms that
children raised in supportive, affectionate, and accepting homes are less
likely to become deviant.  Children rejected by parents are among the most
likely to become delinquent."
     <P>
     
     
     

<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #1:  Fatherless Families </B>
<P>
     According to the professional literature, the absence of the father is
the single most important cause of poverty.  The same is true for crime. 
According to Kevin and Karen Wright, 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Research into the idea that single-parent homes may produce
     more delinquents dates back to the early 19th century....
     [O]fficials at New York State's Auburn Penitentiary, in an
     attempt to discern the causes of crime, studied the
     biographies of incarcerated men.  Reports to the legislature
     in 1829 and 1830 suggested that family disintegration
     resulting from the death, desertion, or divorce of parents led
     to undisciplined children who eventually became criminals. 
     Now well over a century later, researchers continue to
     examine the family background of unique populations and
     reach similar conclusions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     The growth of the poverty-ridden family today is linked directly with
the growth of the family headed by the always-single mother.  And this
modern form of family disintegration -- or more accurately non-formation
-- has its consequences for criminal behavior.  The growth in crime is
paralleled by the growth in families abandoned by fathers.
<P>
     As the chart on the following page shows, the rate of juvenile crime
within each state is closely linked to the percentage of children raised in
single-parent families.  States with a lower percentage of single-parent
families, on average, will have lower rates of juvenile crime.  State-by-state
analysis indicates that, in general, a 10 percent increase in the number of
children living in single-parent homes (including divorces) accompanies a
17 percent increase in juvenile crime.
<P>
     Along with the increased probability of family poverty and
heightened risk of delinquency, a father's absence is associated with a host
of other social problems.  The three most prominent effects are lower
intellectual development, higher levels of illegitimate parenting in the
teenage years, and higher levels of welfare dependency.  According to a
1990 report from the Department of Justice, more often than not, missing
and "throwaway" children come from single-parent families, families with
step parents, and cohabiting-adult families.
<P>
     Abandoned mothers.  In normal families a father gives support to his
wife, particularly during the period surrounding birth and in the early
childhood years when children make heavy demands on her.  In popular
parlance, he is her "burn-out" prevention.  But a single mother does not
have this support, and the added emotional and physical stress may result
in fatigue and less parent availability to the child, increasing the risk of a
relationship with the child that is emotionally more distant.  The single
mother generally is less able to attend to all of her child's needs as quickly
or as fully as she could if she were well taken care of by a husband.  These
factors tend to affect the mother's emotional attachment to her child and in
turn reduce the child's lifelong capacity for emotional attachment to others
and empathy for others.  Such empathy helps restrain a person from acting
against others' well-being.  Violent criminals obviously lack this.  At the
extreme, and a more common situation in America's inner cities, the distant
relationship between a mother and child can become an abusing and
neglectful relationship.  Under such conditions the child is at risk of
becoming a psychopath. 
<P>
      These observations have disturbing implications for society.  If the
conditions in which psychopathy is bred continue to increase, then America
will have proportionately more psychopaths, and society is at an increased
risk of suffering in unpredictable ways.
<P>
     Abandoned sons.  A father's attention to his son has enormous
positive effects on a boy's emotional and social development.  But a boy
abandoned by his father is deprived of a deep sense of personal security. 
According to Rolf Loeber, Professor of Psychiatry, Psychology and
Epidemiology at the Western Psychiatric Institute in the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, "A close and intense relationship between
a boy and his father prevents hostility and inappropriate aggressiveness." 
This inappropriate aggressiveness is an early indication of potential
delinquency later on, particularly in boys.  Furthermore, such bad
behavior is a barrier to the child's finding a place among his more normal
peers, and aggressiveness usually is the precursor of a hostile and violent
"street" attitude.  Elijah Anderson, Professor of Sociology at the University
of Pennsylvania, observes that these young men, very sensitive in their
demands for "respect," display a demeanor which communicates "deterrent
aggression" not unlike the behavior that causes normal peers to reject and
isolate aggressive boys in grade school.  The message of this body
language, of course, triggers rejection by the normal adult community.
<P>
     Absence of a Father's Authority and Discipline.  The dominant role
of fathers in preventing delinquency is well-established.  Over forty years
ago, this phenomenon was highlighted in the classic studies of the causes of
delinquency by Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck of Harvard University. 
They described in academic terms what many children hear their mothers
so often say:  "Wait till your father gets home!"  In a well-functioning
family, the very presence of the father embodies authority, an authority
conveyed through his daily involvement in family life.  This paternal
authority is critical to the prevention of psychopathology and
delinquency. 
<P>
      The benefits a child receives from his relationship with his father
are notably different from those derived from his relationship with his
mother.  The father contributes a sense of paternal authority and discipline
which is conveyed through his involved presence.  The additional benefits
of his affection and attachment add to this primary benefit.  Albert Bandura,
professor of psychology at Stanford University, observed as early as 1959
that delinquents suffer from an absence of the father's affection.
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #2:  The Absence of a Mother's
Love
</B><P>
     According to Professor Rolf Loeber of the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine:  "There is increasing evidence for an important critical
period that occurs early in children's lives.  At that time, youngsters'
attachment to adult caretakers is formed.  This helps them to learn prosocial
skills and to unlearn any aggressive or acting out behaviors."
<P>
     The early experience of intense maternal affection is the basis for the
development of a conscience and moral empathy with others.
<P>
     If a child's emotional attachment to his mother is disrupted during
the first few years, permanent harm can be done to his capacity for
emotional attachment to others.  He will be less able to trust others and
throughout his life will stay more distant emotionally from others.  Having
many different caretakers during the first few years can lead to a loss of this
sense of attachment for life and to antisocial behavior.  Separation from
the mother, especially between six months and three years of age, can lead
to long lasting negative effects on behavior and emotional development. 
Severe maternal deprivation is a critical ingredient of juvenile delinquency: 
As John Bowlby, the father of attachment research, puts it, "Theft, like
rheumatic fever, is a disease of childhood, and, as in rheumatic fever,
attacks in later life are frequently in the nature of recurrences."  A child's
emotional attachment to his mother is powerful in other ways.  For example,
even after a period of juvenile delinquency, a young man's ability to
become emotionally attached to his wife can make it possible for him to
turn away from crime.  This capacity is rooted in the very early
attachment to his mother.  We also know that a weak marital attachment
resulting in separation or divorce accompanies a continuing life of crime.
<P>
     Many family conditions can weaken a mother's attachment to her
young child.  Perhaps the mother herself is an emotionally unattached
person.  The mother could be so lacking in family and emotional support
that she cannot fill the emotional needs of the child.  She could return to
work, or be forced to return to work, too soon after the birth of her child. 
Or, while she is at work, there could be a change in the personnel
responsible for the child's day care.  The more prevalent these conditions,
the less likely a child will be securely attached to his mother and the more
likely he will be hostile and aggressive.
<P>
     The mother's relationship with her children during this early period
is also relevant to the debate over child care.  According to Professor James
Q.  Wilson of the University of California at Los Angeles, the extended
absence of a working mother from her child during the early critical stages
of the child's emotional development increases the risk of delinquency. 
Specifically, say Stephen Cernkovich and Peggy Giordano, "maternal
employment affects behavior indirectly, through such factors as lack of
supervision, loss of direct control, and attenuation of close relationships." 
Thus, forcing a young single mother to return to work too soon after the
birth of her baby is bad public policy.  Unfortunately, the Clinton
Administration's welfare reform bill would do just that.
<P>

<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #3:  Parental Fighting and
Domestic Violence </B>
<P>
     The empirical evidence shows that, for a growing child, the happiest
and most tranquil family situation is the intact primary marriage.  But
even within intact two-parent families, serious parental conflict has bad
effects.  The famous studies of Harvard professors Sheldon and Eleanor
Glueck in the 1950s found that one-third of delinquent boys in their sample
came from homes with spouse abuse.  The Cambridge-Somerville Youth
Study observed that the incidence of delinquent behavior was higher in
intact homes characterized by a high degree of conflict and neglect than it
was in broken homes without conflict.  Dr.  Travis Hirschi, professor of
criminology at Arizona State University, in a study of junior and senior high
school children in Northern California, replicated these findings a decade
later.  As these and other studies have shown, the lack of emotional
attachment to parents is more strongly related to delinquency than is an
intact home.  Professor Kevin N.  Wright, in his review of the literature
for the Department of Justice, lists 21 other major studies that clearly show
the link between parental conflict and delinquency.  The lesson is clear: 
conflict between parents hurts the child.  The more frequent or intense the
conflict, the more the child is hurt emotionally.  In sharp contrast,
tranquillity and peace in the family and in the marriage help prevent
delinquency.
<P>
     Family Breakup.  Breakup of his parents' marriage during the first
five years of his life places a child at high risk of becoming a juvenile
delinquent.  This breakup -- through either divorce or separation -- is
most likely to occur three to four years after marriage.  Therefore, a large
proportion of very young children experience the emotional pain of the early
and final stages of marital dissolution at a time when they are most
vulnerable to disruptions in their emotional attachment to their parents. 
<P>
      Conflict within "step families" (families where at least one of the
married parents is not the biological parent of all the children) also has
serious effects.  According to the California Youth Authority study of
female delinquents, conducted by Jill Leslie Rosenbaum, professor of
criminology at California State University, "In the two parent families
examined in this study a great deal of conflict was present.  Of these
parents, 71 percent fought regularly about the children.  Since there were
often 'his', 'hers' and 'theirs' present, the sources of conflict tended to
result from one set of children having a bad influence on the others, the type
of punishment invoked, or one particular child receiving too much
attention." <P>

      Rates of conflict are much higher outside intact marriage
families.  Not surprisingly, the rates of emotional and behavioral
problems of children are more than double in step families.  Given their
impact on children, the marriage arrangements of parents have significant
effects on the incidence of teenage crime.
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #4:  The Lack of Parental
Supervision and Discipline </B>
<P>
     The absence of parental supervision and discipline often is due
simply to a lack of parenting skill, particularly if the parents were not
supervised properly by their own parents.  Summarizing the findings of the
Oregon Group, a team of social science researchers under the leadership of
Gerald R.  Patterson of the Oregon Social Learning Center, James Q. 
Wilson of UCLA writes: 
<P>
<UL>[I]n order for the parent to teach the child not to use force
     or fraud, the parent must 
   <P><UL> 
          monitor the child's behavior; 
     <P>
          recognize deviant behavior when it occurs; and 
    <P> 
          punish such behavior.</UL>
<P>
      All that is required to activate the system is affection for or
     investment in the child.  The parent who cares for the child
     will watch his behavior, see him doing things he should not
     do, and correct him.  Presto, a decent, socialized human
     being.</UL>
  <P>   
     Summarizing the Oregon Group's work on parental skills, Professor
Kevin Wright advises:  "Notice what the child is doing, monitor it over long
periods of time, model social skill behavior, clearly state house rules,
consistently provide some punishments for transgressions, provide
reinforcement for conformity, and negotiate disagreement so the conflicts
and crises do not escalate.  Monitoring children involves awareness of their
companions, whereabouts, and free-time activities.  It also includes
appropriate communication, accountability of the child to the parents and the
amount of time spent with parents."  A host of other studies confirm that
good supervision is at least as powerful as parental emotional attachment to
the child and other forms of indirect control.  Monitoring fills the child's
need for parental attention, moral education, and correction.
<P>
     The children of single teenage mothers are more at risk for later
criminal behavior.  One reason is that teenage single mothers monitor their
children less than older married mothers do.  They are more inclined to
have an inconsistent, explosively angry approach to disciplining their
children.  In such homes family members, including children, generally use
aggressive, coercive methods to make sure their needs are met by others in
the family.  The parent's inability to monitor a child's behavior
compounds the hostility between parent and child and leads to the first of
the two major stages in delinquency described by the Oregon Group: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[The first stage is a] breakdown in family management
     procedures, producing an increase in antisocial behavior and
     an impairment in social skills and application at school.  [In]
     the second stage, during adolescence, these conditions
     continue and the disruptions in the parents' monitoring
     practices and the adolescent's own poor social skills place
     him further at risk for finding his community in a deviant
     peer group.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
      While parental monitoring and supervision obviously are good for
children, harsh or excessive discipline has just the opposite effect.  The
parents of delinquents are harsher than ordinary parents in punishing their
children; and depressed, stressed, or hostile parents more likely will vent
their anger on their more aggressive children.  In the case of the single
teenage mother, the absence of the father increases the risk of harshness
from the mother.  For these children, harsh punishment can mean parental
rejection.  "Punishment that is too strict, frequent or severe can lead to a
greater probability of delinquency regardless of parental attachments.  That
is, a strong parent-child bond will not lessen the adverse impact of
punishment that is too harsh."
<P>

<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #5:  Rejection of the Child </B>
<P>
     Jill Leslie Rosenbaum, professor of criminology at California State
University, writes:  "Research consistently has shown that those youth
whose bond to their parents is weak are more likely to be delinquent. 
[Y]outh who are more attached to their parents have greater direct and
indirect controls placed on their behavior."
<P>
     As a child's emotional attachment to his parents ensures a well-
adjusted adult, so parental rejection of the child has powerful opposite
effects.  Ronald Simons, professor of sociology at Iowa State University,
summarizes the research findings:  "Rejected children tend to distrust and
attribute malevolent motives to others, with the result being a defensive, if
not aggressive, approach to peer interactions.... Such [rejecting] parents not
only fail to model and reinforce prosocial behavior, they actually provide
training in aggressive noncompliant behavior."
<P>
     Rejection by the family, which is the child's first and fundamental
"community," sets the stage for another social tragedy.  Rejected children
tend gradually to drop out of normal community life.  Professor Simons
continues:  "Parental rejection... increased the probability of a youth's
involvement in a deviant peer group, reliance upon an avoidant coping style,
and use of substances."  Many other studies in the professional literature
replicate these findings.
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #6:  Parental Abuse or Neglect </B>
<P>
     The professional literature is replete with findings of a connection
between future delinquency and criminal behavior and the abuse and neglect
visited upon children by their parents.  This abuse can be physical,
emotional, or sexual.  "Overwhelmingly," observes Patricia Koski,
"studies conducted since 1964 have found a positive correlation between
parent-child aggression-violence-abuse-physical punishment and aggression
on the part of the child."  Or, as summarized by Cathy Spatz Widom,
professor of Criminal Justice and Psychology at Indiana University,
Bloomington, "Violence begets violence."
<P>
     Studies of the official records of abused children and arrested
offenders put this connection in the range of 14 percent to 26 percent. 
But the connection triples to a range of 50 percent to 70 percent once
researchers go beyond official reports of investigated cases of child abuse
to reports of abuse by the delinquents themselves.
<P>
     Significantly, West Coast Crips and Bloods gang members almost
without exception grew up in dangerous family environments.  Typically,
they left home to escape the violence or drifted away because they were
abandoned or neglected by their parents.  Consequently, these young men
have developed a defensive world view characterized by a feeling of
vulnerability and a need to protect oneself, a belief that no one can be
trusted, a need to maintain social distance, a willingness to use violence and
intimidation to repel others, an attraction to similarly defensive people, and
an expectation that no one will come to their aid.  Young women
delinquents who run away from home are also frequently victims of sexual
abuse.
<P>
     The close connection between child abuse and violent crime is
highlighted also in a 1988 study of the 14 juveniles then condemned to
death in the United States:  12 had been brutally abused, and 5 had been
sodomized by relatives.
<P>
     Child sexual or physical abuse alone can outweigh many other
factors in contributing to violent crime but affects boys and girls differently. 
Abuse visited upon girls is more likely to result in depression (the inversion
of anger) or psychiatric hospitalization than in the more outwardly
directed hostility of abused males.  According to Cathy Spatz Widom,
"Early childhood victimization has demonstrable long-term consequences for
delinquency, adult criminality, and violent behavior.... The experience of
child abuse and neglect has a substantial impact even on individuals with
otherwise little likelihood of engaging in officially recorded criminal
behavior."
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #7:  Criminal Parents </B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Patterns of crime are transmitted from generation to generation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     In a longitudinal study of 394 families in England, David P. 
Farrington, professor of criminology at Cambridge University, found that
approximately 4 percent of these families accrued almost half of the
convictions of the entire sample.  "The fact that delinquency is
transmitted from one generation to the next is indisputable.... [F]ewer than
5 percent of the families accounted for almost half of the criminal
convictions in the entire sample.... In order to achieve such concentration of
crime in a small number of families, it is necessary that the parents and the
brothers and sisters of offenders also be unusually likely to commit criminal
acts."
<P>
The findings for England, though dramatic and for a different culture and
country, comport with the earlier U.S.  research as summarized by Professor
Kevin Wright of the State University of New York at Binghamton: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The Gluecks determined that delinquents were more likely
     than nondelinquents to have delinquent fathers and mothers. 
     Subsequent studies supported the Gluecks' findings,
     observing that delinquent boys were more likely to have
     delinquent or criminal parents.  In a study of the families of
     black delinquents in St.  Louis, Robins found that a child's
     delinquent behavior was associated with 1) arrests of one or
     both of the parents in their adult years, and 2) a history of
     juvenile delinquency on the part of the parents.  Children
     with two parents with criminal histories were at extremely
     high risk of delinquency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     Girls involved in crime tend to mate with (if not marry) men with
criminal records.  Jill Leslie Rosenbaum of California State University,
describing young delinquent women in her study, states:  "[T]he men in the
wards' lives bore a striking resemblance to the men chosen by their mothers. 
Many were significantly older than the girls and had criminal records."

<P>

<B> STAGE TWO:  JUVENILE DELINQUENCY </B>
<P><B> Community Experience Leading to Crime #1:  A Child's Rejection by
Other Children</B> 
<P>
     For most normal children, going to school is their first serious step
into the broader community.  But for future delinquents, this first experience
pushes them further down the spiral toward delinquency and crime. 
Because of their family experiences, these children already are aggressive
and hostile.  Normal, emotionally attached children avoid them -- in
effect isolating and rejecting them.  As a result, they seek compatible
company elsewhere, in a group where they feel they belong.
<P>
     As Ronald Simons, professor of sociology at Iowa State University,
writes, "Ineffective parents produce aggressive first graders who are rejected
by their peers and as a consequence must form friendships with other
deviant youth."  Likewise, Gerald Patterson of the Oregon Social
Learning Center says:  "Poor social skills, characterized by aversive or
coercive interaction styles, lead directly to rejection by normal peers." 
Patterson, the leading expert in this area, also makes the point that peer
rejection tends to be linked to ineffective parenting:  "Specifically, early
parent failures contribute to later skills deficits.... Parent skills in solving
family problems correlate significantly with measures of academic skill and
peer relations."  In a study of 1,224 grade school boys, James D.  Roff,
professor of psychology at Eastern Michigan University, concludes that the
boy at highest risk of becoming delinquent "was characterized by aggressive
behavior in the context of peer rejection."
<P>
     Closed off from the community of their peers, future criminals search
out companions who feel comfortable with them.  Not surprisingly, these
companions are similarly aggressive-hostile children with whom they feel
at ease and by whom they are accepted.  The group thus reinforces its own
aggressive-hostile ways and gradually rejects the conventional ways of
normally attached children.  Continued disruption at home, parents'
continued use of harsh discipline, and the continued absence of a father
all add to the growing hostility of these future delinquents.  Association with
delinquent peers -- almost all of whom come from similar family and
parental backgrounds -- is the next significant development on the path to
habitual crime.
<P>
<B> Community Experience Leading to Crime #2:  Failure at School </B>
<P>
     By the age of five or six, small children who are deprived of parental
love and supervision have become hostile and aggressive and therefore have
greater difficulty forming friendships with normal children.  This hostility
also undermines their school work and success.  Professor David P. 
Farrington's Cambridge University study finds a high correlation between
school adjustment problems and later delinquency:  "Youths who dislike
school and teachers, who do not get involved in school activities, and who
are not committed to educational pursuits are more likely than others to
engage in delinquent behavior."
<P>
     Future criminals tend not to have good verbal memory at school or
the ability to grasp the meaning of concepts, including moral concepts. 
They generally fail to learn reading and computation skills, undermining
their performance in the middle grades.  They often fail in the later grades
and have no or low aspirations for school or work.  They begin to be
truant and eventually drop out of school in their teens.  Typically,
before they drop out of school they already have begun a serious
apprenticeship in crime by having far higher rates of delinquency than do
those who graduate.
<P>
     Once again, all these problems are rooted in unfavorable family
conditions.  In a study on juvenile delinquency, Merry Morash, professor of
criminology at Michigan State University, analyzed four large data sets:  the
British-funded Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development and the U.S. 
federally funded National Longitudinal Study of Youth, National Survey of
Children, and Philadelphia Cohort study.  Examining these four large studies
of the development of children, particularly the connection between home,
education, and crime, she concludes:  "[The] mother's [young] age is related
to delinquency primarily through its association with low hopes for
education, negative school experiences, father absence, and limited
monitoring of the child."
<P>
     Consider the bleak impact of these family conditions on the future
of the education system and the next generation of students.  In the mid-
1980s, the Chancellor of the New York City school system was
complaining:  "We are in a situation now where 12,000 of the 60,000
kindergartners have mothers who are still in their teenage years, and where
40 percent  of our students come from single parent households."  But
since then, the national teenage out-of-wedlock birth rate has grown by 50
percent, from 30 births per 1,000 unmarried teenage girls in 1982 to 45 per
1,000 in 1991.
<P>
<B> Community Experience Leading to Crime #3:  The Growth of the Gang </B>
<P>
     Commenting on the work of all parents as their children enter
adolescence, James Q.  Wilson of UCLA writes: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Affection and monitoring had better have done the job
     already, because the "child-rearing" days are over.  It is time
     to hope for the best.... [A] major feature of recent times is
     the increasing independence of adolescents from the family....
     This independence from the family results in increasing
     dependence of the adolescent on other adolescents.  But
     adolescents cannot take the place of parents as socializing
     agents because they have little or no investment in the
     outcome, and are less likely to recognize deviant
     behavior.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     All children, especially during their teenage years, gravitate toward
the influence of their peers.  Not surprisingly, as the professional
literature shows, delinquent peers move a boy in the direction of
delinquency and crime.  The same is true for girls.
<P>
     In the company of their peers, future criminals gradually learn to
exploit the people of their own community, a community to which they feel
no responsibility or obligation.  For these boys, increasingly involved
with delinquent companions, their lives tend to become insulated from the
weakening influence of their families.  Continued weakness in parental
supervision, monitoring, and control invariably escalates the conflict at
home, and this increasing conflict and related family problems cause these
children to deepen their affiliation with delinquent groups, the only class of
people likely to welcome them "with a place to belong to."  While the
children continue their aggressive, hostile, and violent ways, their behavior
also increasingly repels normal, non-aggressive people.  They grow more
familiar and at ease with their delinquent peers.  Dropping out of school
is a natural development. 
<P>
 <B> STAGE THREE:  THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNITY </B>
<P>
     Criminal youth tend to live in high-crime neighborhoods.  Each
reinforces the other in a destructive relationship, spiraling downward into
violence and social chaos.
<P>
          The 1980s witnessed an extraordinary increase in community
violence in most major American cities.  In 1990, homicide in Boston
increased by over 40 percent over the previous year; in Denver, it rose by
29 percent; in Chicago, Dallas, and New Orleans, by more than 20 percent;
in Los Angeles, by 16 percent; in New York, by 11 percent.  In 1988,
nationwide firearm death rates for all teenagers for the first time exceeded
the total for all other natural causes of death combined, and black male
teens were 11 times more likely than their white counterparts to be killed
by guns. 
<P>
           According to the national survey data, there is a clear
correlation between the surge in criminal violence in these largely urban
communities and the collapse of marriage.  Professional research in
criminology also supports this conclusion.
<P>
          Tragically for these communities, single-parent neighborhoods
tend to be high-crime neighborhoods.  Researchers long ago observed that
violent crime, among both teenagers and adults, is concentrated most heavily
in urban neighborhoods characterized by a very high proportion of single-
parent families.  More recent figures indicate the illegitimate birth rate
in many urban neighborhoods is a staggering 80 percent.  And today's
researchers, like those before them, find that a neighborhood composed
mainly of single-parent families invariably is a chaotic, crime-ridden
community in which assaults are high and the gang -- " the
delinquent subcommunity"-- assumes control.  In these chaotic
conditions, parental supervision of adolescent and pre-adolescent children is
almost impossible.  In turn, children living in these neighborhoods are
more likely to learn, accept, and use physical violence to satisfy their wants
and needs.
<P>
          While serious crime is highest in these socially disorganized,
largely urban neighborhoods, however, its frequency is not a function of
race.  The determining factor is absence of marriage.  Among broken
families, with their chaotic, "dysfunctional" relationships, whether white or
black, the crime rate is very high.  Among married two-parent families,
whether white or black, the crime rate is very low.  The capacity and
determination to maintain stable married relationships, not race, is the
pivotal factor.  The chaotic, broken community stems from these
chaotic, broken families.  The reason race appears to be an important factor
in crime is the wide differences in marriage rates among ethnic groups.
<P>
     While the crime rate among blacks has risen sharply, so has the
disappearance of marriage.  The same holds true for whites.
<P>
     A recent report from the state of Wisconsin further illustrates the
same relationship.
<P>
          A high concentration of broken families without husbands and
fathers is the danger signal for future crime.
<P>
          Violent families, violent youth, and violent communities. 
<P>
Violent youth often come from violent parents.  Violent youth are the most
likely to have witnessed conflict and violence between their parents. 
They also are the most likely to commit serious violent crime and to
become "versatile" criminals -- those engaged in a variety of crimes,
including, theft, fraud, and drugs.  Among these youths, physically or
sexually abused boys commit the most violent offenses.
<P>
          Internal family violence is only one major contributor to
adolescent violence in these socially disorganized neighborhoods.  The
neighborhood itself (which includes the youth's violent peers, also rooted in
their own broken families) is the other powerful contributor, especially
to violent delinquency, and its culture of aggression and violence is
imported into the school.  Consider a recent report from the Centers for
Disease Control:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> More than 4 per cent of high school students in Grades 9-12
     had carried a firearm at least once in the past 30 days, and
     35.5 percent of those had carried six or more times during
     that period.  Thus, about 1.4 percent of high school students
     might be considered regular gun carriers.  Furthermore, more
     than 60 percent of the students surveyed in Baltimore
     reported knowing someone who had carried a gun to
     school.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          Given the level of violence in their neighborhoods, for young
people to carry guns for self-defense is perhaps understandable.  And
the youth most likely to feel the need for defense is the member of a street
gang in a violent neighborhood.  After he has committed his first violent
crime, the evidence shows that he is likely to commit further crimes and
more than twice as likely as other criminal youths to commit more
violence.  Various studies indicate that violent crime is much more
likely to come to the attention of the police and lead to investigation and
arrest.  For example, Franklyn W.  Dunford and Delbert S.  Elliott of
the Behavioral Research Institute at Boulder, Colorado, find that young
violent criminals are more likely than others to be arrested. 
<P>
           As a result of the low arrest rate for criminals, even the
alarming official crime figures do not give policymakers a true picture of
what is happening in high-crime communities.  According to Dunford and
Elliott, 93 percent of those committing between 100 and 200 offenses
between 1976 and 1978 were not arrested, while 81 percent of the youth
responsible for more than 200 offenses during the same two-year period
were not arrested.  Explains Dunford:  "These data suggest that only those
at the extreme have any risk of arrest, and even that risk is not high.  It
appears that the volume of crime committed by these youth may be such
that arrest is a function of chance alone.  The police may, figuratively, be
stumbling over them.  The likelihood of arrest is close to zero until one
reports in excess of 100 total offenses."  Elsewhere in the same study,
Dunford reports:  "Of the 242 [career criminals] 86 percent had no record
of arrest.  In other words, the overwhelming majority of self-reported career
offenders were never arrested during a three year period when they were
involved in very frequent and serious criminal offenses."
<P>
          Given the very high frequency of undetected crime by career
(expert) criminals, the other dramatic finding from the Cambridge University
study of British delinquents may hold for the United States as well: 
that 50 percent of all crime probably comes from less than 5 percent of the
delinquents' families.
<P>
          The Family versus the "Hood." Two researchers from the
National Institute of Mental Health, John E.  Richters and Pedro Martinez,
have studied families in high-risk inner-city neighborhoods.  Their study
indicates that only 6 percent of children from stable, safe homes become
delinquent.  Meanwhile, 18 percent of children from homes rated as either
unstable or unsafe (broken marriage or lack of supervision) became
delinquent, but 90 percent of children from homes rated as both unstable
and unsafe became delinquent.  Only 10 percent did not.
<P>
          Such studies show that the family is fighting desperately with
the violent neighborhood for the future of its children.  The good news is
that even in violent and crime-ridden neighborhoods, "good families" are
winning the battle, though a 6 percent juvenile delinquency failure rate is
still a tragedy for them.  Even the troubled family is winning, with its 82
percent success rate, though the one-in-five delinquency rate means that
every second family has had a family member in jail.  Remarkably, even 10
percent of children from the most unstable and unsafe families somehow
survive and escape a life of crime.  The 90 percent delinquency rate
among their siblings may be inevitable, for these are the families with the
highest concentration of neglectful and abusive parents who would warp any
child.
     
     <P>

<B> Delinquent Girls </B>
<P>
     The discussion of delinquency generally focuses on boys because
most violent crime is committed by males.  But while male and female
delinquents have similar experiences, the quality of the intimate family
relations of delinquent females often is much worse.  They tend to be even
less attached to, and to have more problems with, their mothers than do
male delinquents.  They are even more firmly rejected by their female
school peers than are their male counterparts.  And, in turn, they are even
more firmly attached to their own "bad companions" -- the delinquent peer
group -- than are males to theirs.
<P>
          Professor Jill Rosenbaum of California State University paints
a graphic picture of the early life of a female delinquent.  The relationship
between family breakdown or disintegration and later criminal status is
dramatic:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> In 1980, records were requested on 240 women who had
     been committed to the California Youth Authority (CYA),
     the state agency for juvenile offenders.... Family Structure: 
     Very few (seven percent) of these girls came from intact
     homes families.... By the time these girls were 16, their
     mothers had been married an average of four times, and there
     was an average of 4.3 children per family.... Family
     Criminality:  seventy six percent of the girls came from
     families where there was a record of criminality.... Family
     Violence:  Although much data on family violence are
     missing, it is evident that violence was present in many of
     these homes.... Family Conflict:  In the two parent families
     (mainly step families) examined in this study a great deal of
     conflict was present.  Of these parents, 71 percent fought
     regularly about the children.  Since there were often his, hers
     and theirs present, the sources of conflict tended to result
     from one set of children having a bad influence on the
     others, the type of punishment invoked, or one particular
     child receiving too much attention.... Conflict over the use of
     alcohol was present in 81 percent of the homes.... Parent-
     Child Relationships:  A Poor relationship between parent and
     child is highly influential in the child's subsequent
     delinquency.... Many of the girls received very little positive
     feedback from parents in the home.  Of the fathers who were
     present, 53 percent were viewed by parole officers as
     rejecting of the girl, as were 47 percent of the mothers. 
     Rejection came in many forms.... The mothers appeared to be
     not only neglectful, but 96 percent were described as passive
     and 67 percent as irresponsible.... Generational Cycles:  The
     mothers of the CYA wards tend to marry young, with 44%
     having had the ward by the time she was 18.  These
     daughters tended to follow in their mothers' footsteps and
     begin bearing children at an early age.... Parents often
     encouraged this behavior.  One mother explained to her
     daughter's parole officer that she was happy to hear that her
     15-year-old daughter was pregnant --" That is what women
     are supposed to do."...  The men in the wards' lives bore a
     striking resemblance to the men chosen by their mothers. 
     Many were significantly older than the girls and had criminal
     records.... The Mothers:  The wards' mothers did not have
     the supports or resources needed to cope with their
     environments.  They often were socially isolated and
     distrusted those attempting to help.  They viewed welfare
     workers as those trying to take away funds and social
     workers as trying to take away their children.  These attitudes
     and fears began long before the wards were born perhaps
     even before their mothers were born.  The mothers of the
     CYA girls did not know how to be mothers, for they were
     often children themselves when their children were born, and
     lacked the emotional resources to instill a sense of trust and
     security necessary for self esteem and growth.  Over time,
     just trying to survive depleted whatever emotional resources
     they might once have had.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     
<P>
<B> THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF A SAFE SOCIETY
</B><P>
     Most ordinary Americans do not need to survey the social science
literature to know that a family life of affection, cohesion, and parental
involvement prevents delinquency.  In particular, they know almost
instinctively that maternal affection, maternal self-confidence, and the
father's esteem for the mother are among the critical elements in raising
well-balanced children.  The literature bears out these common-sense
assumptions.  Most Americans, too, know that in a law-abiding family
the parents encourage the moral development of their children and promote
an understanding and acceptance of traditional moral norms.  Again, the
professional literature reinforces these common-sense maxims.  As Professor
Wright observes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The existing literature on the topic [of normative
     development] includes a study by Mak that found that a
     belief in law was negatively associated with several measures
     of delinquency for both boys and girls.  Mak further reported
     that feelings of empathy are inversely related to seriousness,
     vandalism, and assault for girls and cheating and assault for
     boys.  Agnew found that a belief that it is good to be
     honest and to avoid cheating was associated with a reduced
     likelihood of delinquency.  Smith and Paternoster
     discovered that moral beliefs reduced the likelihood of
     marijuana use among both males and females.  Paternoster
     and Triplettobserved that moral beliefs were related to
     both the incidence and prevalence of marijuana use, theft,
     and vandalism.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          Moreover, most Americans know that this moral development
of children usually is accomplished within the context of religious belief and
practice.  The government's own surveys of the professional literature
confirm this view.  To continue from Professor Wright's review of the
literature for the Justice Department: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Another study found that attachment to church was
     inversely related to violence.  And, finally Tolan found
     that the moral-religious emphasis within the family... was
     related to self-reported delinquency.
     <P>
     Rodney Stark says that delinquency rises or falls in a high
     school to the extent to which the high schools contain a
     majority of religious students.  This fits with the findings
     that among black men incarcerated and those not is that those
     who do not commit crime participated in church activities
     and had friends who went to church.  By contrast those who
     were incarcerated had deviant friends and did not go to
     church.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     
<P>
 <B> The Crucial Elements </B>
<P>
     The root cause of violent crime thus is found in failed intimate
relationships of love in marriage and in the family.  The breakdown of
stable communities into crime-infested neighborhoods flows directly from
this failure.  In contrast, addressing the root causes of crime requires an
understanding of the crucial elements of supportive family and community
life.
<P>
First in importance and influence is the basic marriage commitment.  Its
vital importance is starkly evident in the catastrophic impact of its absence.
<P>
Second is the relationship of love between parents and children, a love
expressed primarily in supervision.
<P>
Third, stemming from the first and second, is the child's ability to relate to
other children.
<P>
Fourth, the backbone of strong neighborhoods, is friendship and cooperation
between families.
<P>
     It is no coincidence that one of the central rules in the traditional
moral codes of all communities at all times, in all places, and in all cultures
is the prohibition against giving birth to children outside of marriage. 
Societies all over the world have recognized that this prohibition is essential
to social stability and to raising members of each new generation with the
proper respect for their community and their peers.  Unfortunately, and with
disastrous consequences, this prohibition is ignored today in American
society at all levels, but most especially in central-city neighborhoods. 
Having a child outside of marriage virtually guarantees a teenage woman
and her children a life of poverty, low education, low expectations, and low
achievement.  It gradually puts in place the conditions which foster rejection
and, ultimately, crime.
<P>
          Whenever there is too high a concentration of such broken
families in any community, that community will disintegrate.  Only so many
dysfunctional families can be sustained before the moral and social fabric
of the community itself breaks down.  Re-establishment of the basic
community code of children within marriage is necessary both for the future
happiness of American families and for a reduction in violent crime.
<P>
          It follows, then, that the real work of reducing violent crime
is the work of rebuilding the family.  Institutions in the community, such as
the church and the school, have demonstrated their importance in helping to
restore stability.  Government agencies, on the other hand, are powerless to
increase marital and parental love; they are powerless to increase or
guarantee care and attention in a family; they are powerless to increase the
ability of adults to make and keep commitments and agreements.  Instead,
thanks to policies that do little to preserve the traditional family and much
to undermine it, government continues to misdiagnose the root cause of
social collapse as an absence of goods and services.  This misdiagnosis is
government's own contribution to the growth of crime.  Having
misdiagnosed, it misleads.
<P>
          There is an irreplaceable role for political leadership in the
current crisis.  It is not to take the place of family and community,
however, but to articulate a compelling, positive vision of the nation in
terms of family and community life.  As President John F.  Kennedy
inspired thousands of young people to serve others overseas, another must
inspire today's youth to rebuild America's families and community.  This
is the work not of government, but of the nation's primary nurturing
institutions:  family, church, and school.  The missions of these institutions
are missions of love and the moral and the spiritual formation of a people.
   <P>       The alternative is continued social disintegration.  
<P>
<B> WHAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO </B>
<P>
Hold hearings on the real causes of crime.
<P>
     Given the disconnect between the assumptions behind the social
spending in the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1994 and the real root causes of
crime, a major correction in thinking is needed.  The Judiciary Committees
of Congress should conduct a series of hearings on the root causes -- the
long-term causes -- of crime.  These should focus on the relationship of
family structure, and particularly of marriage and religious practice, to the
prevention of violent crime.  The literature, the scholarship, and particularly
the experience are wide and deep.
<P>
Conduct a serious review of all national social programs.
<P>
     Congress ought to conduct a comprehensive review of all national
social programs, inviting the director of each program to present the
evaluation data on the program's effectiveness (or lack of it) in reducing
crime.
<P>
Commission geographical mapping of social problems and their related
conditions.
<P>
Congress should require the Departments of Health and Human Services,
Justice, Labor, and Commerce to provide it with geographical mapping of
the conditions known to be related to crime and other social problems. 
Among the problem indices that should be mapped:
<P>
The different types of crime;<BR>
Drug use;<BR>
Long-term welfare dependency (over two years);<BR>
School performance;<BR>
Out-of-wedlock births;<BR>
Domestic violence, by types;<BR>
Child abuse;<BR>
Sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS.
<P>
     Congress also should require information to examine the relationships
between other social indicators and the lack of crime.  Among the social
strengths that should be mapped:
<P>
Presence of intact primary marriages (comparing these with alternative
family structures, from blended families of different types to different forms
of single-parent families);
<P>
Attendance of adults and children at religious institutions;
<P>
Religious education indices (attendance at religion-based schools and at
supplementary religion classes);
<P>
Volunteer activity in social service associations.
By mapping at the smallest geographical unit possible (county, zip code, or
even smaller), many research benefits can be derived.
<P>
Request research on the effects on children of the intergenerational
transmission of the single-parent family structure.
<P>
     Congress ought to request summary descriptive and comparative
research on how the children of first, second, third, and fourth generation
single-parent families fare on indices of health and development, as well as
social competence, during and by the end of their growing years.  While we
do have some knowledge of the impact of out-of-wedlock birth and
single-parent family life on children, we do not know about multiple-
generation effects.  This knowledge could be very salutary.
<P>
Reform the welfare system.
<P>
     Welfare today is a destructive Faustian bargain between all potential
mothers and the government.  As the condition for receiving cash -- as
opposed to real community support -- the system requires that women and
girls abandon the traditional moral code.  Explains Heritage Foundation
Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector:  "The woman has a contract with the
government:  She will continue to receive her 'paycheck' as long as she
fulfills two conditions:  1) She must not work; and 2) She must not marry
an employed male."
<P>
     Whatever good intentions were served by the welfare system, the
evidence shows that its perverse financial incentives discourage the
formation of intact families and the pursuit of work.  These are the
outcomes of the current "community code" on which high-crime
neighborhoods are built.  Thus, current government policy is a powerful
facilitator of the long-term rise in the crime rate.
<P>
     Legislation is needed to end the destructive features of the welfare
system.  Instead of sending paychecks to single mothers, such a reformed
system should channel money to local institutions and levels of government
that can pull the mother toward helping groups in the community and pull
the community toward the mother and child in need of help.
<P>
     Legislation introduced by Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-NC) and
Representative James Talent (R-MO) (S.2134 and H.R.4566) in the 103rd
Congress takes these necessary steps and would foster a different community
code.  Money now used to support these broken and unformed families
could be given instead to the local community to allow it to decide how best
to help families in need, including newly formed, father-abandoned
families.  The community could disburse this money, at its discretion,
to organizations committed to rebuilding the lives of these broken families.
<P>
Promote -- through leadership in ideas, not national funding --
volunteer community efforts, including the efforts of religious
institutions.
<P>
     Amid the social collapse of so many urban neighborhoods, there are
stunning examples of successful efforts to turn around the lives of young
people previously immersed in crime.  These efforts invariably possess two
features.  One is a strong system of rules within an organization
characterized by the love and firm guidance seen in a supportive family. 
The other is a strong spiritual dimension, most commonly a profound
religious commitment. 
<P>
      Examples of this type of program abound.
<P>
     Example:  Leon Watkins of South Central Los Angeles, convinced
that gangs fill a void for those who join them, helps them do it in a way
that bridges to society.  According to Watkins, being in a gang is like a
religious commitment; there are codes of conduct and service to a higher
good than oneself:  the gang itself.  Watkins shows gang members how to
be true to all that attracts them to the gang and yet be true to themselves
and society around them.  The spiritual inspiration behind all his efforts
becomes clear to the youth.  They learn how to become aware of the
spiritual dimension of their lives.
<P>
     Example:  The Reverend Lee Earl started a church in one of the
most desolate sections of Detroit, a neighborhood whose economy was built
on drugs, prostitution, and welfare.  Within a decade the same neighborhood
and the same inhabitants, under the inspiration of the spiritual leadership of
Rev.  Earl, motivated by a trust in God, had rebuilt their community.  They
became married families, started small businesses, and rebuilt and bought
out their own homes.  Crime plummeted and a community was reborn.
<P>
     Giving people a place to belong and hope in a future, hope
communicated through inspiring leadership, is common to all these
successes.  Giving a neglected child a place to belong -- someone to belong
to -- is communicated through the spirit of a giving person, something
beyond social work alone.  It involves a long-term personal relationship with
a child.  These relationships do not take money, but they do take a generous
commitment of personal time, as in Big Brothers and Big Sisters. 
Government cannot purchase these efforts.  If it tries, it will vitiate them by
turning moral relationships into monetary ones.
<P>
Promote, through leadership in ideas, the benefits to the nation of
regular worship at religious institutions.
<P>
     The importance of codes of conduct and religious practice can hardly
be overstated.  According to the professional literature, active participation
in a church significantly correlates with decreased incidence of crime. 
Expansion of active church membership and religious worship in a
community contributes to the reduction of crime.
<P>
     Government cannot re-empower religious institutions, for their
essential nature is moral and spiritual.  But it can be less hostile to their
traditional areas of competence and mission.  The potential for good among
many religiously inspired schools, especially in America's inner cities, is
well-known.  But Congress and the courts insist that the price of
government cooperation in education is noncooperation among the three
nurturing institutions of family, church, and school.  This strategy weakens
communities.
<P>
Conduct inner-city experiments with school vouchers.
<P>
     Schools that maintain discipline and strong moral values can help
support families that value these virtues and may make a difference in
communities that have broken down.  Parents need to be able to select such
schools when their children are at risk.  To give parents this choice, states
and localities can be encouraged to offer vouchers to lower-income families. 
So far states have resisted conducting these experiments.  The federal
government ought to finance and evaluate six to twelve such local
demonstrations.
<P>
     Recent poll data in California and New Jersey confirm the general
pattern of support for vouchers:  not surprisingly, it is the poor who most
want vouchers for private schools for their children.  The poor well
understand the importance of good schools in giving young people in crime-
ridden neighborhoods the chance for a productive life.  Private and religious
schools have the major advantage of being able to instill and enforce a
moral code for teachers, children, and parents.  This is just the help that
parents in fragile, crime-ridden communities desperately need.  In the battle
between the family and the "Hood," such schools can be crucial allies for
parents.  Vouchers provide the constitutional and financial means for this
close and effective cooperation between school and family in the moral
formation of children.
<P>
Remove barriers to adoption.
<P>
     Many children would have the benefit of a stable, two-parent family
-- reducing the probability that they would descend into crime -- if adoption
were made easier.  Unfortunately, there are many frustrating barriers to
adoption. 
<P>
      The largest barrier is the ethos of the social services establishment,
which discourages adoption as the preferred option for a young unmarried
mother and her child.  The best way to deal with this is to provide
competition by allowing other institutions to provide adoption services.  One
of the best competitors could be the nation's churches, which have great
outreach to young pregnant women and to couples desiring to adopt.  Black
churches are particularly well poised to perform this function and are likely
to take care of balancing the needs of the child in racial matching of the
parents where possible while also ensuring a speedy adoption, no matter
who the parents are.  However, liability law needs to be changed to remove
obstacles to churches, particularly small churches, wishing to provide this
natural form of charity.
<P>
Reduce taxes on marriage and children.
<P>
     The federal tax code discriminates against the institution of marriage
and the raising of children.  Since the early 1950s, the tax system each year
has increased the tax burden at a much faster rate on families raising
children than on any other form of household.  Talk of "family" values
is largely meaningless if it does not address this central economic
relationship between government and family, a relationship that will always
be there, no matter the levels of social problems.  A government intent on
doing its limited best in the long-term prevention of crime will adjust its tax
code to reflect the fundamental importance of stable marriage to the social
order.
<P>
     The federal government can and should reform features of the tax
code that hurt families with children -- particularly low-income working
families.  One such egregious feature is the "marriage penalty" on fathers
and mothers who move from cohabitation to married family status.  Another
step Congress can take is to enact tax credits or other tax relief for parents
with children.  Adjusting the tax system to benefit the intact family silently
but powerfully upholds marriage and the family.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     The professional literature of criminology is surprisingly consistent
on the real root causes of violent crime:  the breakdown of the family and
community stability.  The sequence has its deepest roots in the absence of
stable marriage.
<P>
          Despite the good news that overall crime rates have dropped
in recent years, the frightening news is that both the level and viciousness
of teenage violent crime have been rising steadily.  More ominous still, this
was set in motion sixteen to eighteen years ago, when these violent
teenagers were born into chaotic family and social conditions.  Since then
these conditions have become more prevalent, and we will see a continued
rise in violent teenage crime.  Furthermore, America is headed toward a 50
percent out-of-wedlock birthrate sometime in the next twelve to twenty
years, inching more and more of the country closer to today's inner-city
illegitimacy rate.  If this trend is not reversed, Americans must prepare for
extensive and serious erosion of public safety and practical freedoms.
<P>
          Government can staff and manage the criminal justice system
efficiently and prevent crime in the short term by locking up violent teenage
criminals so that they are no longer a danger to others.  But it lacks both the
capacity and competence to tackle the root causes of crime.  That is the
mission of three other basic institutions of society:  the family, the church,
and the school.  For close to five decades government has increasingly
burdened these institutions -- has even become hostile to them.  It is now
time to help these institutions fulfill their missions by reversing course and
removing these burdens.
<P>
     However, it will take real leadership -- leadership through ideas and
passionately meant words -- to inspire us all to cooperate in rebuilding our
marriages, families, neighborhoods, and communities. That is the appropriate
work for America's political leaders and statesmen.

<P><hr width=50%></center>
<P>


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration continues to retreat in the war on drugs. After a decade of consistent progress during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, almost every available indicator today shows the United States is losing -- some would say surrendering -- in the prolonged struggle against illegal drugs. Consider the evidence:
<p><ul>
<li> Since President Clinton took office, the number of 12-to-17-year-olds using marijuana has almost doubled -- 2.9 million compared with the 1992 level of 1.6 million.<sup>3</sup>  One in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana, and 48.4 percent of the Class of 1995 had tried drugs by graduation day.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<li> LSD use has reached the highest rate since recordkeeping started in 1975. Fully 11.7 percent of the Class of 1995 had tried it at least once.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<li> The number of cocaine- and heroin-related emergency room admissions has jumped to historic levels. In the first half of 1995, cocaine-related emergency room cases were 65 percent above the level in the first half of 1991. Heroin admissions soared 120 percent over the same period.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> Methamphetamine use has turned into a major problem, particularly in the western United States. In the first half of 1995, meth-related emergency room cases were up by 321 percent compared with the first half of 1991.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While there are many different reasons for this deterioration in America's resistance to illegal drugs, part of the explanation is a failure in federal policy. President Clinton and his Administration have demonstrated little leadership on the issue and have failed to send out an unambiguous message of disapproval to young Americans. The President's personnel appointments in this area have ranged from the virtually invisible, as in the case of former "drug czar" Lee Brown, to the embarrassing, as in the case of Dr. Joycelyn Elders, former Surgeon General of the United States. Staffing at the Office of National Drug Control Policy was cut by 80 percent -- from 147 to 25. Moreover, although the President's election year budget reverses this cut and requests major increases for drug law enforcement, his FY 1995 request would have eliminated 621 drug enforcement positions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration's policy initiatives have been similarly ineffectual, especially their focus on hard core drug users at the expense of stronger law enforcement and interdiction. The evidence is in: Federal illegal drug caseloads fell by 10.3 percent from FY 1992 to FY 1995; the government-wide interdiction budget has been cut 39 percent since 1993; the impact of interdiction programs has dropped off sharply; and drug-related hospital emergency room admissions have hit record levels.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead of pursuing ineffectual anti-drug policies and giving the impression that curbing drug use is not a priority, the President and Congress should demonstrate leadership in this deadly contest. If the United States is serious about combating the infiltration of illegal drugs across America's borders and into the nation's cities, towns, neighborhoods, and schools, several steps need to be taken: 
<p><ul>
<li> The President must use the "bully pulpit" of his office to send out a clear message that drug use is unacceptable.
<p>
<li> America must assist its allies in Latin America and elsewhere in their efforts to take on the drug cartels.
<p>
<li> President must propose budgetary, personnel, and policy initiatives that make it absolutely clear that Washington means business in curbing the flow of drugs into America. 
<p>
<li>Congress should pass legislation to close loopholes that result in excessively lenient sentences for marijuana smugglers.
<p>
<li> Congress should continue to block the United States Sentencing Commission's proposals to lower sentences for crack cocaine dealers. 
<p>
<li> Washington must get serious about promoting rehabilitation that works, such as religion-based programs, instead of simply funding programs that promise to rehabilitate drug addicts and fail to deliver. Congress should re-evaluate all treatment programs carefully. The basis of federal funding for drug rehabilitation should be a clear track record of success.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America succeeded in reducing the rate of drug use, especially among vulnerable teenagers, in the 1980s because local efforts were reinforced by a serious program of law enforcement, interdiction, and hard-headed demand reduction policies, and because the Reagan and Bush Administrations made it very clear that they were determined to win the war against drugs. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration has adopted a very different posture, and America is now losing the war. 

<p>
<b>THE FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The illegal drug problem is admittedly complex, but complexity is no excuse for inaction. President Clinton began derailing the successful approaches of prior administrations from the earliest days of his presidency. After promising to "reinvent our drug control programs" and "move beyond ideological debates," the President announced a new approach to drug policy, de-emphasizing law enforcement and effecting a "controlled shift" away from interdiction. More important, in a message to Congress, he promised to "change the focus of drug policy by targeting chronic, hardcore drug users."<sup>8</sup>  This ineffectual policy -- the latest manifestation of the liberals' commitment to a "therapeutic state" in which government serves as the agent of personal rehabilitation -- seems to have been rejected even by the President's new drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey, who has moved to elevate the profile of prevention programs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Cuts in the interdiction system and the dismantling of other programs with records of success have been accompanied by the increased availability of drugs. Ironically, as illustrated in Figure 3, the Clinton drug policy has been most harmful to its intended beneficiaries -- the very hard-core drug addicts who are cycling through emergency rooms at record rates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The President's lack of visibility on the drug issue has drawn criticism from prominent congressional supporters of drug control programs, including leading Democrats in the House and Senate. Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE) admits he has "been openly critical of this President's silence."<sup>9</sup>  And Representative Charles Rangel (D-NY) has gone so far as to declare, "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any Administration that's been so silent on this great challenge to the American people."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, since taking office, President Clinton has been significantly engaged in only one aspect of the drug problem -- drugs in schools, which arguably is not even the federal government's responsibility. In June 1995, Clinton promised to veto any attempt by the 104th Congress to cut the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program, which Congress had evaluated and found to be ineffective. Bob Peterson, former Michigan drug czar, described the program as a "slush fund," and even former ONDCP Director Lee Brown acknowledged "abuses of the program" in testimony before a House subcommittee.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Disturbing Change in the Trends.</b> During the 1980s and early 1990s, the United States experienced dramatic reductions in casual drug use -- reductions that were won through increased penalties, strong presidential leadership, and a clear national anti-drug message. Beyond the substantial investment of resources, engaged commanders in chief used the bully pulpit to change attitudes. Because Ronald Reagan and George Bush visibly involved themselves in the effort to combat illegal drugs, they helped rescue much of a generation. Overall, casual drug use was cut by more than half between 1977 and 1992. Casual cocaine use fell by 79 percent, while monthly use fell from 2.9 million users in 1988 to 1.3 million in 1992.<sup>12</sup>  Strong presidential leadership had tangible effects.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Against this backdrop of accomplishment, Bill Clinton promised to get even tougher than his predecessors. Indeed, while campaigning for the presidency, then-Governor Clinton appeared to take an even harder line on illegal drugs than Bush, declaring that "President Bush hasn't fought a real war on crime and drugs ... [and] I will."  On the link between drugs and crime, Clinton said, "We have a national problem on our hands that requires a tough national response."<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite the tough rhetoric, however, the President's performance has been disappointing. Perhaps the first solid indication that rhetoric and reality would not fit neatly in the same policy box was the appointment of Dr. Joycelyn Elders of Arkansas as Surgeon General of the United States. Dr. Elders, among other things, offered the taxpayers the tantalizing theory that legalization of drugs might "markedly reduce our crime rate" without increasing drug use.<sup>14</sup>  As for the President himself, his image of rhetorical toughness was compromised on occasion by remarks that could at best be described as indifferent, at worst as flippant.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<b>DOWNGRADING THE WAR ON DRUGS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The President's ill-considered public words have been accompanied by a reduction in tangible resources and effort. Within weeks of taking office, the Clinton Administration announced that it would slash the Office of National Drug Control Policy staff from 147 to 25. The President made the Director of the Office a member of the Cabinet, but the move was empty symbolism. This became painfully evident when his new Director, former New York City Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown, was observed to be virtually invisible during his two-and-one-half-year tenure. President Bush's Drug Policy Director, William Bennett, told Congress that the Clinton Administration cuts essentially would relegate the new Director to the position of an office clerk.<sup>16</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Cuts in the drug czar's office prefigured much larger cuts in federal enforcement and interdiction agencies. The Administration's fiscal 1995 budget, for example, proposed to slash 621 drug enforcement positions from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Customs Service, FBI, and Coast Guard.<sup>17</sup>  The DEA, America's only law enforcement agency dedicated exclusively to fighting the drug trade, lost 227 agent positions between September 1992 and September 1995 -- more than 6 percent of its agent force.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Declining Caseloads.</b> Cuts in law enforcement paralleled reduced drug case filings. As illustrated in Chart 4, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts registered a 10.3 percent reduction in federal case filings between FY 1992 and FY 1995, and the total number of defendants indicted in these cases declined by 8.5 percent. The number of federal drug cases refused for prosecution increased by 18.6 percent over the same period as U.S. Attorneys pursued more investigations into health-care fraud and other areas deemed to be of greater priority than combating illegal drugs (Chart 5).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In an April 26, 1995, letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-UT), then-Drug Policy Director Lee Brown attributed the "troubling" decline in prosecutions to "the policies of the new U.S. Attorneys who de-emphasized prosecution of small-scale drug offenders."  Director Brown also quoted the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to the effect that the change had been "consistent with DOJ policy."
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite the abundance of data confirming the declining trend in illegal drug prosecutions, Clinton Administration officials have cited different figures, compiled by the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, to suggest that case filings and defendants prosecuted actually rose 12.9 and 12.1 percent, respectively, between fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1995 (see Chart 6). But even according to these figures, the number of drug defendants prosecuted dropped for the three years prior to 1995, and remains 5.2 percent below the FY 1992 level.<sup>18</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a textbook illustration of the laxness of Clinton Administration drug policy, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> revealed on May 12, 1996, that hundreds of marijuana smugglers "have been allowed to go free after U.S. authorities arrested them with substantial quantities of drugs at ports of entry in California."<sup>19</sup>  Attorney General Janet Reno objected to the article's claims, noting that the individuals in question are "punished" by having their border crossing cards confiscated. Ms. Reno added that prosecution may be "deferred" only if five mitigating factors are present, a claim that elicited this reaction from Bush Administration Drug Enforcement Administration head Robert C. Bonner:
<p><ul>
<li>	Reno claims that only Mexican nationals qualify under the leniency policy. This results in two standards of justice. U.S. citizens are prosecuted, but Mexican nationals get a free ride to Mexico.
<p>
	<li>Another criterion is being caught with under 125 pounds of marijuana. So, if you are smuggling "only" 100 pounds, with a wholesale value of over $100,000, you meet one of the criteria.
<P>
	<li>Now, Reno also says that there must also be "insufficient evidence" of knowledge and intent, but, of course, no one should be prosecuted, regardless of citizenship or quantity, if evidence of knowledge and intent are not present.<sup>20</sup>
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Dropping the Safeguards. </b> The Clinton Administration began to reduce America's drug interdiction efforts within a year of the inaugural. On November 3, 1993, against the vehement objections of senior Coast Guard officers, the National Security Council issued a classified presidential memorandum dictating a "controlled shift" of interdiction assets to other functions. At the same time, flight hours in the so-called "transit zone" between the United States and South America were cut by 50 percent, many interdiction aircraft and helicopters were put into mothballs, ship "steaming days" were cut by a third, and <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/defenselink/">Department of Defense</a> detection and monitoring budgets were reduced by more than half. Controlling for inflation, the aggregate government-wide drug interdiction budget has been cut 39 percent since the last year of the Bush Administration (see Chart 7).<sup>21</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The impact of these cuts was almost immediate: As Chart 8 illustrates, between 1993 and 1994, U.S. interdiction forces experienced a 47 percent drop in their ability to stop drug shipments from Latin America. Cocaine seizures by the Customs Service and the Coast Guard fell by 70 percent and 71 percent, respectively, during the same period.<sup>22</sup>  Overall interdiction effectiveness has dropped by a cumulative 64 percent between 1993 and 1996.<sup>23</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some, including General McCaffrey, have attempted to argue, against the evidence, that this reduced effectiveness was the result of changing trafficker routes, not vastly diminished levels of national effort. This argument is refuted by an interdiction study commissioned by the Clinton Administration itself. The study, performed for the Office of National Drug Control Policy by the EBR Corporation, using conservative assumptions, showed that restoring $500 million in assets to the transit zone could cause seizures, jettisons, and mission-aborts totaling 130 tons of cocaine per year. In round terms, this means that restoring half the assets cut by the Clinton Administration could result in the seizure or disruption of more than the entire amount of cocaine seized domestically every year.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Stimulating Demand. </b> Cuts in interdiction and law enforcement have had additional consequences that should have been predictable to anyone with even a modicum of understanding of the basic economic laws of supply and demand. As illustrated in Chart 9, between 1993 and 1994 -- the first year of the "controlled shift" away from interdiction -- the retail price of a gram of cocaine dropped from $123 to $104. Two years later, the price was still a low $107 per gram. Heroin prices have fallen even more sharply, from $1,647 per pure gram in 1992 to $966 per gram in February 1996.<sup>24</sup>  The increased availability of such relatively cheap drugs has helped drive hard-core drug use -- as reflected in emergency room admissions -- to record levels.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While most drugs are produced in inaccessible regions overseas, limiting the impact of U.S.-sponsored eradication programs, the bulk of the marijuana consumed in the United States is produced domestically. Domestic marijuana eradication under the Bush Administration was highly successful -- so successful, in fact, that marijuana became more expensive, ounce for ounce, than gold. Hawaiian producers were forced to import marijuana to satisfy local demand for the first time in recent history. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration, however, has deemphasized marijuana eradication. As shown in Chart 10, there has been a 59 percent reduction in cultivated plants destroyed since 1992.<sup>25</sup>  The drug budget of the U.S. Park Service has been cut 22 percent from the FY 1992 level,<sup>26</sup> resulting in a 47 percent reduction in plants eradicated by the Park Service. Once again, increases in supply have fueled demand (use by 8th graders has increased 184 percent since 1992) and caused prices to drop (marijuana prices are at the lowest level in eight years). 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The ubiquitous availability of illegal drugs -- <I>de facto</I> legalization -- is confirmed by the Administration's own data. According to the latest White House report on drug use,<sup>27</sup> heroin is now so cheap and pure that it has "driven new demand and drawn some former addicts back into use."  Meanwhile, the availability of cocaine and crack is described as "high," and marijuana is "plentiful and potent" and "widely available" in all areas of the country except California.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By making drugs more expensive, aggressive interdiction and law enforcement efforts reduce use among particularly vulnerable inner-city populations by forcing addicts to spend their limited disposable income on a smaller quantity of drugs.<sup>28</sup>  A cocaine addict named "Joe," interviewed for a book<sup>29</sup> on the impact of cocaine, describes the phenomenon: "What keeps you from dying is you run out of money."  Conversely, paring back supply reduction programs hits hardest those who are most heavily addicted and least able to resist drug use.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Rising Emergency Room Cases.</b> This phenomenon is evident in the record number of drug-related emergency room admissions that have followed in the wake of the Clinton Administration's cuts to enforcement and interdiction programs. (It is instructive that these record increases have occurred despite the Clinton strategy's stated concern for hard-core addicts, the primary population captured by the emergency room statistics.) Compared with the first half of 1994 (which was then the high water mark for drug-related emergency room cases), cocaine-related emergencies have increased 12 percent (from 68,400 to 76,800); heroin-related episodes have risen 27 percent (from 30,000 to 38,100); marijuana-related episodes have increased 32 percent (from 19,100 to 25,200); and methamphetamine cases have jumped by a staggering 35 percent (from 7,800 to 10,600).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hard-core addicts deserve access to treatment, but experience teaches that the typical addict will cycle through the treatment system several times over a period of years before getting off drugs, with many never reaching that goal. A 1994 RAND study found that only 13 percent of heavy cocaine users who receive treatment are either non-users or light users at the end of a year. The study also found that 20 percent of heavy users continue to use drugs while in treatment.<sup>30</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Getting serious about hard-core drug use ultimately requires America to do more to fight youthful drug use: While hard-core users are mostly beyond the reach of drug treatment professionals, today's young people can be dissuaded from going down the road that leads to hard-core addiction. In fact, those who reach age 21 without using drugs almost never try them later in life. Conversely, drug users almost always start young, and almost invariably by smoking marijuana.<sup>31</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>An About Face? </b> With U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey's appointment as the new point man on drugs, the President indicated he was reversing his decision to gut ONDCP and discarding his misguided strategy of targeting hard-core users. The editors of <I>The Washington Post</I> called the change an "about face."  President Clinton was able to capitalize on the installation of a tough-minded general; White House aide Rahm Emmanuel was candid enough to say that the changes were "what the President believes will help us improve on our record."<sup>32</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given the Clinton Administration's previous track record, however, it remains unclear whether Director McCaffrey's appointment means a genuine change in course. His is a managerial position that accords him little line authority, and his policy accomplishments will depend largely on his willingness and ability to take on the various empires of the federal bureaucracy. This in turn will depend on the degree to which he is supported by the President of the United States. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, early indications suggest that Director McCaffrey may be reticent to test the President's commitment to an effective anti-drug strategy. For instance, McCaffrey recently sided with the Department of State in supporting a determination that Mexico had "cooperated fully" with the United States on drug control matters, even though the head of the DEA objected that the government of Mexico had not done enough to warrant that designation. This determination was made even though the Administration could have waived the sanctions that typically accompany decertification. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This decision sounds a disturbing signal about the degree of General McCaffrey's leverage on drug questions. The United States imports 400 tons of cocaine annually, 70 percent of it transshipped through Mexico. Yet Mexico's seizures have slumped to roughly one-twentieth of the amount passing through their country. Arrest figures are down significantly, and the former president's brother, Raul Salinas, has been arrested on suspicion of "drug-related charges."  Four Mexican trafficking "confederations," meanwhile, operate with relative impunity. But President Clinton's statement to Congress explained away Mexican inaction on the peso crisis and declared weakly that President Zedillo's administration has "set the stage for action against the major drug cartels in Mexico."<sup>33</sup>  For too long, the U.S. has accepted at face value repeated Mexican promises of future aggressive action against the drug trade. It is time for such complacency to end.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

McCaffrey also appears to have had little positive impact on recent high-level appointments. For example, on June 12, 1996, Patricia M. McMahon was nominated to serve as his Deputy Director for Demand Reduction, a post that requires Senate confirmation. A former Clinton campaign worker with little substantive background in drug policy, Ms. McMahon's appointment to a lower-level position was criticized by the <I>Washington Post</I> in the early days of the Clinton Administration as "an example of continued political patronage."<sup>34</sup>  Her principal contribution to the White House drug office was to serve as the political operative who carried out the slashing of the staff by 80 percent at the start of the Administration.
<p>
<b>THE COMPONENTS OF A NEW ANTI-DRUG POLICY </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The President and Congress can retake the initiative in the continuing struggle against drug use and the agents of the criminal network that is exporting poison into America's neighborhoods. But this cannot happen without the full leadership of the President and his Administration. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 The Administration must take several decisive steps:
<p><ol>
<b><li>Use the bully pulpit.</b> When President George Bush gave the first national primetime address of his presidency, it was on the drug issue. By doing this, he followed the example of visible and emphatic national leadership set by President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan. The national effort against drugs -- carried on by parents, young people, local religious leaders, neighbors, local law enforcement, educators, medical personnel, and local government officials -- gains immeasurably from strong, visible presidential support. But it is weakened considerably by the perception of presidential indifference. 
<p>
<b><li> Do more in Latin America.</b> Fighting drugs at the source makes sense. Federal authorities ought to be going after the beehive, not just the bees. Foreign programs are also cheap and effective.

<p>An example: America's chronically underfunded program in Peru will cost just $16 million to run in FY 1996. But targeting even that meager amount effectively can work. The Peruvians have managed to shoot down or disable 20 trafficker airplanes since March 1, 1995. Unfortunately Peruvian President Fujimori's aggressive line on drugs actually caused President Clinton to bar Peru from receiving radar tracking data. That decision has badly damaged Peruvian-American relations, but Fujimori has continued to work with the United States, and much more can be done at very small cost. The Peruvian air force currently uses obsolete A-37 jet trainers from the 1950s. For $50 million, the United States could equip the Peruvians with new tracker aircraft, improved night-flying gear, and spare parts. This is an opportunity to save American lives by helping the Peruvians press their attack on traffickers. In addition to helping countries like Peru, the United States should make effective cooperation in fighting drugs one of the most important requirements for Latin nations seeking good diplomatic and economic relations.
<p>
<b><li> Set more sensible budget priorities.</b> The Department of Defense today is allowed to spend only 0.3 percent of its budget on preventing the inflow of drugs. The U.S. military cannot solve the drug problem, but it can make a profound contribution to cutting the flow of drugs through interdiction. The budget needs to reflect this national priority.
<p>
<b><li> Reduce marijuana availability.</b> The federal government urgently needs to restore leadership to the fight against marijuana production, trafficking, and use. Federal marijuana penalties need to be stiffened, partly by eliminating the loophole that allows marijuana smugglers to be treated far more leniently than marijuana growers. Federal eradication efforts need to be reinvigorated.
<p>
<b><li> Block lower crack sentences.</b> Last year, the United States Sentencing Commission proposed steep reductions in sentences for crack dealers. Those changes were blocked by statute. In its 1997 amendments cycle, the Sentencing Commission is expected again to propose changes. Irresponsible public policy proposals by the Sentencing Commission should be blocked, and the Commission should be barred from proposing changes in criminal penalties where Congress has established mandatory minimum sentences, except in an advisory format that would require affirmative congressional action before taking effect.
<p>
<b><li> Stop undercutting those drug treatment programs that do work.</b> Taxpayers have heard the stories about waiting lists for drug treatment. Waiting lists are not fiction -- they do exist. On the other hand, one program that rarely has waiting lists is Mitch Rosenthal's well-regarded Phoenix House, a tough program where addicts spend 18-24 months literally learning to live new lives. Programs like Phoenix House have a proven track record dating back to 1967. But they are unpopular with addicts because, to quote one analyst, "a residential program with constricted freedom, rigorous rules, and enforced separation from drugs is the last place most addicts want to find themselves, at least initially."35  Nevertheless, these approaches work. Yet taxpayers today pay billions of dollars on drug treatment that allows the addicts to decide for themselves how rigorous and how long their treatment will be. Not surprisingly, this arrangement does not work very well. 
<p>
In addition, while many faith-based treatment programs report remarkable success with the addicted, their religious character usually bars them from receiving government treatment funds. In a break from current policy, Representatives Jim Talent (R-MO) and J.C. Watts (R-OK) have introduced a bill, the American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">HR 3467</a>), which would allow neighborhood groups, including religious institutions, the same access to federal funds that is enjoyed by other drug treatment and counseling facilities. States also would be able to contract with these drug treatment centers. Discrimination against effective religiously based programs should end.Taxpayer funding for drug treatment should be tied strictly to results, religiously based programs should be eligible for funding, and addicts who seek publicly funded treatment should be required to enter rigorous programs and face real sanctions if they fail to complete them.
</ol><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration has a poor record in fighting the war on drugs. Interdiction efforts and prosecution for illegal drugs are down, illegal drug usage and emergency room admissions are up, and there has been an absence of credible presidential leadership on this issue. Part of the problem also has been a failure in personnel management: the inability or unwillingness to appoint effective leaders in key positions to articulate and enforce a strong anti-drug message, as well as inappropriate reductions in staff at agencies dedicated to dealing with the problem on the front lines. With the appointment of General Barry McCaffrey as Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, this situation may improve, although the McMahon appointment is far from encouraging. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

American taxpayers need and deserve presidential leadership on this issue. Members of Congress also need to focus federal efforts on law enforcement and interdiction programs that work, and fund only those rehabilitation programs that have a track record of success. One way Congress can do this is to allow funding for drug counseling and drug rehabilitation programs provided by religious organizations. Congress and the states also should undertake a tough re-evaluation of existing grant recipients to make sure that funding is going to programs that work best in reducing dependency on illegal drugs. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

America's illegal drug problem is complex and presents a special challenge for policymakers in Congress and the White House. But the complexity and the difficulty of the issue are no excuse for ineffective policy and a lack of serious effort.

Costs and prices  are falling as quality and variety of services increase. At least, this  is the case in economies thatthanks to reformed or reduced regulationenjoy  competitive markets for such services. But, here in the United States,  the telecommunications industry has the distinction of being one of the  most regulated. And, if you look closely, its prices are not decreasing  all that rapidly. As for service, the offerings are characterized more  by fragmentation than by improved quality.</P>  <P>In response, 12 years after the breakup of the telephone public utility,  we are seeing an order-of-magnitude increase in regulation. What should  have been a &quot;shakeout&quot; of corporate and regulatory practices  that block the way to genuine competition has turned out to be a <I>shakedown</I>  of potential entrants by government regulators favoring an established  clientele.</P>  <P>Two questions: (1) How is it that a pervasive regulatory process has  become the controlling factor in the most dynamic and potentially most  competitive industry in our economy? And (2), Given Congress's stated purpose  in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to prevent current regulatory constraints  from interfering with the transition to a dynamic and competitive set of  markets how has this increase in regulation happened?</P>  <P>There is a short answer to the second question. As President Ford once  said to me, the worse the regulation, the less likely it will change; and  since this is not only the most pervasive but also the worst regulation,  the answergiven the activities of the Federal Communications Commission  and the 50 state regulatory commissionscould be that the service offerings  of the telecommunication companies are fixed in their current form at their  current prices.</P>  <P>But the &quot;short answer&quot; is unacceptable (because, among other  things, it ends this essay). In order to continue, we need to consider  another answer. Looking further into the experimental aftermath of the  1996 Act will help us see if we can predict an outbreak of new services,  and new revenue-sources, from competitors new and old. To make this step,  we should focus on history and be clear on how we got here. We are here  because of the AT&amp;T divestiture of 1984, the Telecommunications Act  of 1996 and, most recently, the FCC's First Report and Order of August  1996.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I>From Divestiture to the FCC's August Ruling</I></B></P>  <P>Until 1984, AT&amp;T enjoyed a monopoly which was franchised and price-regulated  by the federal and state regulatory agencies, in return for which it provided  end-to-end universal service.</P>  <P>The overwhelmingly large share of AT&amp;T's activities were devoted  to providing basic local service, at monthly charges that covered direct  operating costs, while vertical (add-on) services, local toll and interstate  toll were provided at per-call prices sufficiently in excess of direct  costs to develop profit margins high enough to pay for the infrastructure.</P>  <P>Over the previous 12 years, long-distance revenues tripledbut at least  half of this increase was paid contributions to cover the overhead costs  of the entire local and long-distance system. As in numerous other markets,  regulated or unregulated, these rising revenues became an attraction to  other potential long-distance carriersones who were without such &quot;requirements&quot;  to provide for the infrastructure of a lattice of local networks.</P>  <P>At the same time, new transport technologies (such as microwave) enabled  the entry of specialized carriers into lucrative long-distance markets.  AT&amp;T's aggressive responsesincluding delays in providing interconnection,  selective price-cuts, and the promotion of new regulatory barriersprovoked  the antitrust proceeding that resulted in divestiture of the company's  local exchange from its long-distance operations.</P>  <P>The local exchange carriers of AT&amp;T were put together into seven  regional operating companies, each offering local exchange and local tolls  in its region only, under the continuing jurisdiction of the federal and  state commissions for rates and service. But the focus of the new policy  was on long-distance. Here the downsized AT&amp;T would face reduced regulation  and regulation with a new purpose, to operate so as to develop open competition  in these markets. Indeed, the CEO of AT&amp;T and the head of the antitrust  division both promised that the development of competition would lead to  genuine deregulation in long-distance.</P>  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>From 1984 to 1996, we had a full 12-year dose of collective  agency decisions. This policy process has not resulted in long-distance  markets becoming competitive.</B><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>  <P>The policy process for generating such competition in long-distance  was unique. The antitrust court, the Justice Department and the FCC were  to make collective decisions for the long-distance carriers on entry, service-offerings,  and pricing. They were to decide what carriers could offer which specific  services at tariff-certified rates. Entry into long-distance would be open  to all comers, except it was not to be allowed by the FCC to the now-divested  Bell operating companies. Competition ideally would come from new facilities-based  long-distance carriers; but since there were none, it would have to come  from the expansion of MCI and Sprint, along with whichever independents  and resellers come over the transom.</P>  <P>From 1984 to 1996, we had a full 12-year dose of collective agency decisions.  This policy process has not resulted in long-distance markets becoming  competitive.</P>  <P>The tariffing of AT&amp;T's prices, as worked out by the FCC, made it  easy for the other two major carriers to follow the leader, so that, by  the late 1980s, MCI and Sprint were matching but not undercutting AT&amp;T's  prices. As market-concentration in revenue-shares continued to decline,  or particularly as AT&amp;T's share continued to decrease, the price-cost  margins of all three companies increased.</P>  <P>This was most striking in message toll services (MTS) where margins  rose from 50% to 70%, as the HHI concentration index fell by almost that  much <A HREF="footnote.html">(footnote 1</A>). These countertrends were  pervasive in Inbound WATS as well as Outbound WATS . All three carriers  now enjoy price-cost margins exceeding 70% for almost all services <A   HREF="footnote.html">(footnote 2)</A>. This level of marginthe same as  for AT&amp;T before divestitureis the highest in any industry I know of,  despite the fact that AT&amp;T at least continues to yield market-share.</P>  <P>The economic term used to describe such behavior is &quot;tacit collusion  in oligopoly.&quot; In business terms, this results from a strategy that  focuses on earnings, rather than share, in market conditions where a company  can count on the other major suppliers doing the same.</P>  <P>With the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress again attempted to  inject competition into long-distance markets, this time by fostering entry  of an extremely important group of potential new long-distance carriers  left out by the antitrust divestiture. The Act attempts to make a difference,  explicitly, by permitting the local Bell operating companies (previously  excluded from providing long-distance service) to offer those services  now provided for the most part by AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint.</P>  <P>But the Act has two provisions that more strictly regulate those potential  entrants. First, it requires them to demonstrate that their own local exchange  markets are competitive before they can enter long-distance. Second, and  perhaps fatally, it places the FCC in charge of the process for certifying  that those local markets have become competitive.</P>  <P>Welcome to the &quot;shakedown&quot; phase, in which the first line  of potential competitors in long-distance must pay &quot;rebate,&quot;  by fostering entry into their own markets.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I>Competitors, Yes; Competitiveness, No</I></B></P>  <P>To begin to regulate as required by the Telecommunications Act, the  FCC issued its First Report and Order in August 1996. In more than 940  pages, it sets out how local competition will be achieved. The theory is  that competition in local exchange, which has to come first, will result  from new local carriers using parts of the system networks of the incumbent  operating companies. Such &quot;attachment&quot; might not be the permanent  state, but it is at least the initial state of this competitive market  structure.</P>  <P>Note how this breaks new ground in deregulatory experiments. After all,  new airlines, or gas pipelines or railroads, did not &quot;attach&quot;  themselves to existing networks.</P>  <P>To make this possible, the FCC has sought to anticipate every type of  contract agreement on attachment between entrant and incumbent, and to  set &quot;guidelines&quot; on the technical nature as well as prices for  service resulting from attachment at the loop, the switch or the line.  The guidelines are to be used for all attachment agreements between entrant  and incumbent to be approved by state regulatory agencies.</P>  <P>In the event of a breakdown in contract negotiations, the guidelines  themselves are the required terms and conditions that the state agencies  have to use when they write the contracts. In that case, the incumbent  carrier turns itself over to the state agency-to provide to entrants &quot;available  telephone, service-interval information and maintenance histories [so that]  competing carriers [do not] operate at a significant disadvantage.&quot;</P>  <P>One must be in awe of an FCC that states that it will specify the terms  on which any new local carrier attaches to the loop, switch, trunk or tandem  of any incumbent carrier anywhere in the fifty states. The Commission's  confidence that it can replace private decision-making in millions of different  transactions is impressive, particularly when it is intended that the result  be &quot;competition&quot; between attacher and attachee.</P>  <P>Indeed, that the Commission is proceeding this way in order to establish  competition in place of regulation is confounding. The extent of regulation  required to carry out the commission's procedure is far greater than ever  before. Since Adam Smith's time, competition has never been established  by forcing an incumbent supplier to attach potential competitors to its  system. The only way that a market structure so shared can be made stable  is by the regulator setting the terms so that the regulatory system itself  ends up providing financial support for the attachees.</P>  <P>The FCC's First Order in fact does call for abundant subsidies to be  provided to entrants into local exchange. For attachment at the loop, switch,  or trunk, the incumbent is required to set prices determined by its total  element long-run incremental cost (TELRIC) for that network element. TELRIC  is a figment of an imaginary scenario in which the <BR>  incumbent operating company theoretically replaces its existing equipment  entirely with new equipment based on the latest technology.</P>  <P>The companies are doing no such thing. Rather, they are more or less  the current product of old and new technologies, with current marginal  operating costs only approaching TELRIC to the limited extent a company  network is made over. But that does not matter, for TELRIC is to be used  as the basis for prices in order to &quot;prevent incumbent local exchange  carriers from exploiting their market power at the expense of their competitors  that are dependent on the incumbent's facilities.&quot; The Commission  believes competitive prices will result.</P>  <P>Yet, given that TELRIC is below current marginal costs for incumbent  carriers, TELRIC prices will be below competitive prices for network parts.  By requiring TELRIC prices, the FCC is indirectly providing a subsidy to  prop up entrants by as much as one-third of competitive price. This cannot  be an accident, given that the FCC comes to the same result in its &quot;guidelines&quot;  for the wholesale prices for bundled services the incumbent must now offer  the entrant.</P>  <P>As entrants, AT&amp;T and MCI can request that the local operating company  provide to them a complete local exchange service, which they will resell  as part of their package of local and long-distance offerings. The price  for that local service is required to be set at the incumbent operating  company's retail price for the same service minus the &quot;avoided costs&quot;  of that part of its retail function foregone at wholesale.</P>  <P>However, what the Commission defines as &quot;avoided&quot; includes  not only the billing and advertising costs associated with retail-only  services, but also indirect, shared costs and even so-called &quot;profits.&quot;  Loading on those overhead costs results in a retail-to-wholesale discount  of 17 to 25%, which is twice too much to reflect the actual costs avoided.  The entrants will enjoy a 50% price-cost margin at retail on resale of  the incumbents' local exchanges.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I>Two Questions,Two Sets of Stocks</I></B></P>  <P>The FCC's First Report was just the first of three. The Commission plans  to set out two more parts of the regulatory structure in two more 900-page  Orders. They will set the price structure at retail for the Bell operating  companies in their local markets.</P>  <P>These FCC Reports all have to be completed and put into effect before  the FCC authorizes operating-company entry into long-distance. After all,  such entry into long-distance markets is the operating companies' goal.  With current consumer prices three times costs at the margin on long-distance,  that is where the profit opportunity is.</P>  <P>What is the timing of these steps by which entry is to be allowed? It  is only possible after the FCC issues its second and third reports, to  set guidelines for universal service and pricing structures in, again,  local service markets.</P>  <P>But, on October 15, the St. Louis Federal Court of Appeals issued a  stay in the implementation of the First Order, on grounds that there was  cause to believe that the FCC had improperly extended its jurisdiction  to cover that of the state agencies under the 1996 Act. Only after this  appeal is heard, and decided, and appealed to the Supreme Court, will all  three FCC Orders have been completed.</P>  <P>Then the Commission might certify that local service is sufficiently  competitive for local carriers to be allowed to enter long-distance markets.  But even this finding might not be enough, for the FCC also has to be convinced  of a &quot;public interest&quot; in allowing such entry.</P>  <P>Anyone familiar with regulatory agency procedures in the network industries  needs only to know two things to determine the final results for long-distance  markets. The first is: In which company's interests are FCC decisions being  made?</P>  <P>The First Report and Order emasculates the earnings from local services  in unbundled network elements and in wholesale bundles to be provided by  the Bell operating companies to the long-distance carriers. So the answer  has to be the three large long-distance carriers: They will benefit from  too-low local exchange service wholesale prices. Meanwhile those that do  not benefitthe local carriersby protesting, in order to delay having to  offer these prices, are kept out of the lucrative long-distance markets.  This also benefits the long-distance carriers.</P>  <P>Indeed, that the Commission serves the long-distance carriers is the  assessment of those who know best investors in the common shares of the  telecommunications companies. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the  FCC First Report and Order have affected telecommunications stock prices  in ways that indicate just such a reality.</P>  <P>When the Act was signed into law, the common stock of both operating  companies and long-distance carriers generally increased in value. That  was not surprising. Institutional investors optimistically believed that  removing regulatory barriers to entry in all markets would give rise to  a more competitive environment, which would lead to more rapid innovation  and greater revenue growth. On balance, even though competition brings  lower prices, its presence and the absence of regulation would have a positive  effect on earnings in the telecommunications sector generally (as has deregulation  in surface transportation, natural gas, etc.).</P>  <P>On August 1, when the Commission circulated the First Report and Order,  the picture began to change. From that point through mid-October, the share  prices of the Bell operating companies declined by close to 7%, or nearly  $16 billion, as compared to a 6% increase in the S&amp;P 500, and an 8%  gain in the prices of non-U.S. telecommunication stocks.</P>  <P>The operating-company response will likely be to cut back capital spending-spending  that will not be picked up by the large long-distance carriers on local  exchange capacity. Why should they pick it up, as long as they can buy  wholesale services at the TELRIC-based deep-discount prices? As long as  the Commission uses the new interconnection rules to create a profitable  arbitrage opportunity to resellers, investment in network capacity will  be curtailed. A forecast of five years of no change is not disproved by  the first finding.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I>Innovation Takes The Hit</I></B></P>  <P>The second question to answer then becomes critical: Will advanced network  technologies provide a route around these regulatory obstructions? After  all, Federal Express used computer information and new air traffic network  systems to invent services that could not be regulated by the Interstate  Commerce Commission and Postal Rate Commission; it was not long before  these agencies became substantially irrelevant to the forward development  of surface transportation. Could the same not happen in long-distance?</P>  <P>Unfortunately, it will be different: Advanced network technologies require  large investments that will not be forthcoming from the incumbent local  and long-distance carriers when plain old technologies are available at  prices below current costs of providing their services. This regulatory  agency has found the ultimate strategy for preventing its irrelevance and  ultimate demisenamely, to set prices that are predatory to the advanced  technologies that can work around regulation.</P>  <P>Some competition could still, eventually, break out. We have indications  of that at the current time. Recent initiatives of AT&amp;T and MCI have,  for the first time in this decade, begun to focus on price as the means  to expand total service levels.</P>  <P>Still, it is difficult to projectfrom the new one-price plan of AT&amp;Tany  change in strategy from tacit collusion to low-price dominance. After all,  15 cents per minute is going to change my long-distance bill of $255 by  only $7.53 (according to the AT&amp;T contract telemarketer I talked to  on the phone during a recent dinner hour).</P>  <P>In effect, there are several hypotheses for explaining the new discount-plan  price-reductions. The first is that AT&amp;T felt a loss of control in  these markets due to its evident breakdown in internal management. Second,  that this is a pricing strategy to contain the market-share gains of the  operating companies after they enter long-distance.</P>  <P>But, as arguments, both of these explanations are far-fetched. It is  more likely that AT&amp;T has gone to this one-price strategy to contain  its loss of long-distance share to small facilities-based long-distance  carriers and to its own resellers. Because AT&amp;T was experiencing increasing  margins of profitability in residential Message Toll Service, retail prices  were too high or were out-of-line with WATS (wide-area telephone services)  wholesale and business services. That followed from MTS price-cost margins  rising while margins on contracts to resellers were not increasing as rapidly.  AT&amp;T, in effect, was advancing its earnings margins to benefit itself,  but also, derivatively, was helping resellers in their share gains against  these higher retail margins.</P>  <P>This last explanation is more credible than the argument that a new  strategic focus on pricing is underway, in anticipation of competitive  entry into long-distance by the Bell operating companies. To believe the  latter flies in the face of the fact that the long-distance carriers scored  a singular victory, with the FCC's First Report and Order, in its campaign  to keep the operating companies out of long-distance.</P>  <P>The First Report takes all the profitability out of local exchange before  the local carriers will be certified for entry into long-distance. The  plethora of legal initiatives to reject the First Report in the Federal  Appeals Courts will slow down that process. For the foreseeable future,  the Bell operating companies have trained their strategic direction on  surviving in local exchange, rather than competing in long-distance. Long-distance  entry remains the light at the end of the tunnel, but the train has been  required to go off into a local-exchange sidetrack.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I>Doing Much Less With Many More </I></B></P>  <P>You may think too much of this sounds like Vice-President Al Gore, and  that I have offered an analysis so enmeshed in legal moves and countermoves  it ignores the good news of an advanced technology industry that itself  is playing a large role in establishing the information-based economy.  (After all, it was the Vice-President who said nine months ago that we  will not achieve key regulatory reforms required to move along the Information  Superhighway if Congress keeps cutting the FCC's budget.)</P>  <P>So perhaps it is time to step back from the FCC machinations and gain  perspective. The history of this industry is indeed dominated by advances  in technology, through microwave and fiber, to a high level of performance  <I>in spite of</I> massive regulatory intrusion into the management decisions  of companies of all sizes and in all markets.</P>  <P>But the regulatory process has reduced industry growth and efficiency,  while seeking to preserve profitability for a few firms. In that tradition,  the FCC's First, Second and Third Orders to implement the 1996 Telecommunications  Act <I>will</I> increase the number of companies in telecommunications,  <I>will </I>halve the profitability of the incumbent local exchange companies,  and <I>will </I>significantly retard the advancement of competition in  long-distance.</P>  <P>To achieve that high level of accomplishment, the FCC and the state  regulatory agencies will have to grow their own organizations by at least  50%. This last statement is the easiest of all to defend.</P>  <P>Consumers and Congress alike are now confronting the grim reality: What  should be a shakeout of corporate and regulatory practices on the way to  an era of dynamic competition has become a shakedown of potential entrants  by regulators favoring an established clientele. The cause of competition  has been betrayed.</P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>    <P><CENTER><BR>    <B>Discovery Institute Adjunct Fellow Paul W.

But beginning in parochial school I was taught that He could use  natural processes to produce life. Contrary to conventional wisdom, religion  has made room for science for a long time. But as biology uncovers startling  complexity in life, the question becomes, can science make room for religion?  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>In his statement, the Pope was careful to point out that  it is better to talk about &quot;theories of evolution&quot; rather than  a single theory. The distinction is crucial. Indeed, until I completed  my doctoral studies in biochemistry, I believed that Darwin's mechanism  -- random mutation paired with natural selection -- was the correct explanation  for the diversity of life. Yet I now find that theory incomplete. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>In fact, the complex design of the cell has provoked me  to stake out a distinctly minority view among scientists on the question  of what caused evolution. I believe that Darwin's mechanism for evolution  doesn't explain much of what is seen under a microscope. Cells are simply  too complex to have evolved randomly; intelligence was required to produce  them. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>I want to be explicit about what I am, and am not, questioning.  The word &quot;evolution&quot; carries many associations. Usually it means  common descent -- the idea that all organisms living and dead are related  by common ancestry. I have no quarrel with the idea of common descent,  and continue to think it explains similarities among species. By itself,  however, common descent doesn't explain the vast differences among species.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>That's where Darwin's mechanism comes in. &quot;Evolution&quot;  also sometimes implies that random mutation and natural selection powered  the changes in life. The idea is that just by chance an animal was born  that was slightly faster or stronger than its siblings. Its descendants  inherited the change and eventually won the contest of survival over the  descendants of other members of the species. Over time, repetition of the  process resulted in great changes -- and, indeed, wholly different animals.    That's the theory. A practical difficulty, however, is that one can't  test the theory from fossils. To really test the theory, one has to observe  contemporary change in the wild, in the laboratory or at least reconstruct  a detailed pathway that might have led to a certain adaptation. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Darwinian theory successfully accounts for a variety of  modern changes. Scientists have shown that the average beak size of Galapagos  finches changed in response to altered weather patterns. Likewise, the  ratio of dark- to light-colored moths in England shifted when pollution  made light-colored moths more visible to predators. Mutant bacteria survive  when they become resistant to antibiotics. These are all clear examples  of natural selection in action. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>But these examples involve only one or a few mutations,  and the mutant organism is not much different from its ancestor. Yet to  account for all of life, a series of mutations would have to produce very  different types of creatures. That has not yet been demonstrated. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Darwin's theory encounters its greatest difficulties when  it comes to explaining the development of the cell. Many cellular systems  are what I term &quot;irreducibly complex.&quot; That means the system  needs several components before it can work properly. An everyday example  of irreducible complexity is a mousetrap, built of several pieces (platform,  hammer, spring and so on). Such a system probably cannot be put together  in a Darwinian manner, gradually improving its function. You can't catch  a mouse with just the platform and then catch a few more by adding the  spring. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>All the pieces have to be in place before you catch any  mice. An example of an irreducibly complex cellular system is the bacterial  flagellum: a rotary propeller, powered by a flow of acid, that bacteria  use to swim. The flagellum requires a number of parts before it works --  a rotor, stator and motor. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Furthermore, genetic studies have shown that about 40  different kinds of proteins are needed to produce a working flagellum.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>The intracellular transport system is also quite complex.  Plant and animal cells are divided into many discrete compartments; supplies,  including enzymes and proteins, have to be shipped between these compartments.  Some supplies are packaged into molecular trucks, and each truck has a  key that will fit only the lock of its particular cellular destination.  Other proteins act as loading docks, opening the truck and letting the  contents into the destination compartment. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many other examples could be cited. The bottom line is  that the cell -- the very basis of life -- is staggeringly complex. But  doesn't science already have answers, or partial answers, for how these  systems originated? No. As James Shapiro, a biochemist at the University  of Chicago, wrote, &quot;There are no detailed Darwinian accounts for the  evolution of any fundamental biochemical or cellular system, only a variety  of wishful speculations.&quot;   A few scientists have suggested non-Darwinian  theories to account for the cell, but I don't find them persuasive. Instead,  I think that the complex systems were designed - purposely arranged by  an intelligent agent. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Whenever we see interactive systems (such as a mousetrap)  in the everyday world, we assume that they are the products of intelligent  activity. We should extend the reasoning to cellular systems. We know of  no other mechanism, including Darwin's, which produces such complexity.  Only intelligence does. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Of course, I could be proved wrong. If someone demonstrated  that, say, a type of bacteria without a flagellum could gradually produce  such a system, or produce any new, comparably complex structure, my idea  would be neatly disproved. But I don't expect that to happen. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Intelligent design may mean that the ultimate explanation  for life is beyond scientific explanation. That assessment is premature.  But even if it is true, I would not be troubled. I don't want the best  scientific explanation for the origins of life; I want the correct explanation.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>Pope John Paul II spoke of &quot;theories of evolution.&quot;  Right now it looks as if one of those theories involves intelligent design.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+1>Michael Behe is a Professor  at Lehigh University and the author of the critically acclaimed <I>Darwin's  Black Box</I>.</FONT></B></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

It's both a political statement by one who's been  there and a human testimony by a young woman with an unusual literary maturity,  certainly when measured by contemporary standards. And if Ms. Dahlby, a  Cornell grad (physics major) now working for a high-tech corporation, reaches  perhaps too harsh a conclusion if a woman really loves the service, she'll  leave her more nuanced moments bear witness to things that too often get  trampled in the blind quest for total equality . . . and in the equally  blind attempt to pretend that half the species isn't female. <BR>  <BR>  I became aware of Karen Dahlby a few weeks ago, via the standard unsolicited  query. So-and-so, she wrote, gave me your name and thought that you might  be interested in reading my. . . plus the standard, always faintly humiliating  SASE. (Self Addressed Stamped Envelope, so the object of your supplication  doesn't have to pay for the privilege of telling you to get lost.) <BR>  <BR>  I know from SASE's. A decade or two ago, I'd tried my hand at another kind  of non-regulation military fiction: a Beltway novella about the encounter  of a disgraced Marine colonel and his long-ago lover, now a Congresswoman  determined to become the first female secretary of defense. A novel about  a woman captain running an Air Force Aircraft Maintenance Unit couldn't  be much farther out. And anyway, reading unsolicited manuscripts seems  as good a form of community service as any.<BR>  <BR>  The title, &quot;Placeholder,&quot; refers to the literal meaning of the  word lieutenant: an officer who stands in for an absent superior. The plot  centers on the relationship between the unit's officer-in-charge, Capt.  Alexandra Ahlquist, and her new lieutenant, Stephanie Leclair. Alexandra,  a career type who values integrity yet knows how to play the Air Force  game, has a few weeks to prepare her new lieutenant to run the unit before  she leaves for a temporary assignment in Saudi Arabia. Stephanie's former  enlisted, street smart, college-educated (electrical engineering), and  equally intent upon excellence. Yet she begins to infect Alexandra with  her doubts as to whether women should really be in that hangar at all.<BR>  <BR>  The human element becomes fascinating. Two young women commanding a couple  hundred men of various ratings, sizes, and intensities. But the women focus  on each other. They're doing the same things men do, yet doing them utterly  differently. The way Captain Ahlquist preps, mentors, and disciplines Lt.  Leclair there's an emotional edge, a calculated game-playing that, in a  man, would be both offensive and ineffective. The men keep their distance,  a diffidence compounded of respect, distaste, and backbrain knowledge of  what would happen to their careers, were they to get out of line. <BR>  <BR>  Alexandra leaves Stephanie in charge. While in Saudi, a stray thought occurs:  Might Stephanie be interested in one of her unit's most attractive males,  Master Sergeant Lombard? The wonder becomes obsessive and Alexandra realizes  the depth of her own, hitherto unadmitted, interest in the man. When she  returns, nobody will tell her what happened, personally or professionally,  except that &quot;Everything's OK.&quot; Stephanie and Lombard seem particularly  reticent, and Alexandra endures a double torture: not knowing about her  unit or her fantasy, because the system requires that women's shortcomings  remain unacknowledged. <BR>  <BR>  Stephanie decides to resign. No clear reasons given. None demanded. A few  weeks later, Alexandra tries to write to Stephanie about her own doubts,  but realizes that the relationship is over. Stephanie's gone on to other  things in another world. For Alexandra to follow her would be throwing  away her career and - she shudders - the only family she expects to have.  So she crosses out &quot;Stephanie&quot; and writes &quot;To Cadet Alexandra  Ahlquist&quot;:<BR>  <BR>  &quot;I want to tell you some things. Things someone should have warned  you about. You don't want the military. You like the military, sure, but  mostly because of the kind of people who are in it. The kind of men who  are in it, I mean. You can't win. You'll always be competing with, fighting,  the ones you really wanted to be on a team with. If you win, then you won't  be interested in being on their team anymore. If you lose, you'll feel  inferior. . . .&quot; <BR>  <BR>  She muses that &quot;things happen, but I never expected it would be so  common I'd get used to it. Broken families are no more shocking than broken  aircraft now. Now that I've seen the cases of rape, the cases that weren't  rape, the colonels having affairs with sergeants, the maternity uniforms  on unmarried girls, the bets on who goes to bed with whom . . .&quot; <BR>  <BR>  A few weeks later, a plane crashes. The cause is traced to a female sergeant  who'd been improperly trained, advanced, and supervised because she was  female. Alexandra knows how it will be handled.<BR>  <BR>  &quot;That meant, I told myself after I had found a shredder and fed the  report to it page by page, that because I was female, I could not depend  on the Air Force to tell me if I was incompetent. That meant that I could  be a danger to my own unit and no one would tell me. It meant that the  scope of the problems might be so great no one was going to say anything  because it would bring up questions about everything. It meant that as  long as there was anything political about women in the military I could  not trust the Air Force to do its job of being prepared for war.<BR>  <BR>  &quot;I called in sick the day after I read the accident report, and that  was not dishonesty.&quot; <BR>  <BR>  Unfair to the Air Force? Perhaps. Arguably, the Air Force has done the  best job of integrating women and still seems capable of some pretty heavy  warfighting. But women in the military is no longer a purely military,  or even a political issue. It's starting to suffuse the cultural debate,  and may well become a key battlefield in the Culture War. Perhaps it should.  <BR>  <BR>  To those opposed to women in all or part of the military, these passages  will be ammunition. To those whose only priority is &quot;women&quot; and  their &quot;rights,&quot; it probably won't matter. But is there any possible  middle stance, based on recognition that equality (not sameness) is a fact  of life that never shouldn't have been a fact of life, and that getting  it right must be a long and often messy affair? <BR>  <BR>  &quot;Placeholder,&quot; by its civility and complexity, contributes to  that possibility. Would that another woman, another vet, might write another  &quot;Placeholder,&quot; with a different point of view.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Philip Gold is director of defense and aerospacestudies at the Seattle-based Discovery Institute.</FONT></B></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><FONT SIZE=-1><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></FONT></A><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="crsc1.html"><IMG SRC="crscbttn.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><AHREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Thank you for coming. My name  is Philip Gold. I do Discovery's defense and national security work. In  fact, I'm the only person at Discovery who does defense work, so it's always  a treat when I get a chance to talk to somebody besides myself.</P>  <P>As you know, one of the special things about Discovery is that nearly  all of us have multidisciplinary backgrounds and many of us work in more  than one field. Mark Plummer, whom you just heard, does our environmental  work, but he's also an economist. Roberta Katz, who will do the next presentation,  is a high-tech lawyer with a doctorate in anthropology. I also have two  fields: national security and American culture, specifically, life after  the Culture Wars. So when I'm not worrying defense, I'm the resident feminist,  deep ecologist, psychobabble expert, and general purpose postmodernism  guru. I used to think it was kind of a schizophrenic way to make a living,  but now I realize it's more manic-depressive . . . manic referring to the  Pentagon, depressive describing the state of our culture. Or perhaps depressive  describes the Pentagon, and manic refers to the culture.</P>  <P>In any event, I've been asked to predict the next four years in defense  and national security. In one sense, that's impossible. Four years is an  eternity in this Age of Instant Everything, of policies too often based  on CNN inputs and MTV outputs. And, of course, nothing ever gets done unless  it's a crisis or a scandal, preferably both, and nowadays the American  people have hundreds to choose from. In fact, if you believe the surveys,  more Americans are worried about space aliens than national defense.</P>  <P>But in another sense, predicting the future of defense is the easiest  thing in the world. Just think of it as a Seattle weather forecast &shy;  more of the same unless it changes, rain turning to showers, and if you  don't like what you see, just wait fifteen minutes. Something else will  come along. For those preferring a less rosy scenario, I refer you to Mr.  Murphy, and to the First Codicil of Murphy's Law:</P>  <P>Murphy was an optimist.</P>  <P>But at a more serious level &shy; and defense is a serious, a deadly  serious business &shy; I would suggest that, absent a war or a major catastrophe,  these are the years the locust are going to eat. We will waste them arguing  secondary to non-issues, on infighting and turf battles at home, and abroad  on that peculiarly American version of the Politics of Feeling Good about  Yourself, Global Style . . . that odd array of activities, from military  social work to shooting cruise missiles, by which we periodically demonstrate  our resolve to demonstrate our resolve. And I don't think the situation  would be much different, were Bob Dole getting ready to move into the White  House.</P>  <P>We need to get beyond this. So I'd like to take the Discovery approach  &shy; looking farther into the future and farther into the past, in order  to get a better sense of what's happening and what needs to be done. Such  a look, farther into the future and farther into the past, yields the central  proposition of this talk:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>The Age of the Wars of Ideology is over. The Age  of the Wars of Terror and Identity has begun. What are we going to do about  it, and how do we prepare for it?</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>To get at this, I would like to look generally at three sets of propositions  and recognitions:</P>  <P>1) American national security policy is decadent. And again, this is  not a partisan issue. It wouldn't be that different under a Dole administration.</P>  <P>2) There is now a conceptual basis for a nondecadent security policy,  and sufficient coherence to turn that policy into strategy.</P>  <P>3) That nondecadent strategy can be supported militarily, provided certain  long-term trends and opportunities are recognized.</P>  <P>After that, I should like to make ten recommendations for the funding  and structuring of the 21st century military.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>American National Security Policy Is Decadent.</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>I use the word here in two ways. First, in the literal Latin meaning,  <I>decadere</I>, a falling-away, with the implication of a falling-away  from some previous standard. I also use the word in the way Robert Adams,  a literary critic, used it in a few years ago in a book entitled, <I>Decadent  Societies</I>. He defined lowest-common-denominator decadence as &quot;the  deliberate neglect of the essentials of self-preservation.&quot; In both  senses, the word describes the state of American security policy.</P>  <P>The falling-away here is from a previous standard of coherence and purpose.  Through most of the 20th century, American security policy has been both  coherent and purposeful. Sometimes it was not especially realistic &shy;  making the world safe for democracy didn't quite come up to code &shy;  but as for the unconditional surrender of the Axis and the containment  of Soviet communism: Missions Accomplished.</P>  <P>But today, we are told, incessantly told, no such coherence is possible.  This is the New World Disorder, everything is crazy, we have to wait until  it sorts itself out. But it already has sorted itself out. It is very coherent.  To repeat:</P>  <P>The Age of the Wars of Ideology is over. The Age of the Wars of Terror  and Identity has <I>begun.</I></P>  <P>Of course, parts of this new era may not affect or concern us. And American  foreign policy should not be militarized. Our overall policy should be  based upon that supplication in the 1928 Episcopal <I>Book of Common Prayer</I>  where we ask to stand ready &quot;to do good to all men, according to our  abilities and opportunities.&quot; Promoting democracy and human rights,  women's rights and responsible environmentalism, advancing American trade  and strengthening the community of nations, these should be our goals.  Nonetheless, two clear and present dangers have emerged. And if they have  not taken traditional nation-state forms, they are still far from incoherent.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><UL>  <UL>    <LI><I>Weapons of Mass Destruction</I> (WMD) nuclear, biological, chemical,    and high-power conventional, in the hands of those who wish us ill, whether    nation-states, subnational groups, supranational movements, criminals,    terrorist organizations, even individuals. The people I talk to who work    in this field, at both the policy and operational levels, tell me it's    no longer a matter of if WMD will be used against the American homeland.    It's a matter of when. And that use may well occasion the greatest carnage    on this continent since the Civil War.    <LI><I>Violent Expansionist Islamic Fundamentalism</I>. And let's be very    clear here about what we mean. The enemy is not Islam, which is one of    the world's great faiths. Islam has its gracious and humane side, and has    given the world countless cultural treasures. Nor is the enemy the people    of Islam, any more than the Russian people were the enemy during the Cold    War. Nor is the enemy Islamic fundamentalism <I>per se</I>, even though    many of its practices, especially regarding women, may strike us as ludicrous    to abhorrent. Islamic fundamentalism only becomes the enemy when it turns    expansionist and violent, when it spreads its violence across the globe,    alone and in concert with other nations, groups, movements, and criminal    elements. And we must understand that the enmity of Islamic fundamentalism    is now based upon more than American support of Israel, or our historic    (and not always comfortable) relations with &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;modernizing&quot;    Islamic regimes. It is also based upon a profound detestation of much of    American culture. Some weeks ago, the Iranian government announced the    development of an &quot;Islamic Barbie Doll,&quot; wearing Islamic clothing    and accompanied by a &quot;Ken&quot; doll, dressed as a clerical student.    It sounds ridiculous, but I wouldn't want to be debating a devout Muslim    and have to defend some of the values associated with old Ken and Barbie.    And we do well to remember that some of the condemnations thundered forth    twenty years ago (Has it been that long?) by the Ayatollah Khomeini were    also being voiced by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.  </UL></UL><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>A Nondecadent Security Policy Is Now Possible and  Necessary.</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>In his history of the Second World War, Winston Churchill called the  1930s &quot;The Gathering Storm.&quot; A storm is gathering again. In fact,  any nondecadent security policy begins with recognition of two gathering  storms: one related to the global proliferation of WMD, the other to violent  expansionist Islamic fundamentalism. Recall those maps so popular during  the Cold War, showing the spreading of communism &shy; the areas shaded  red, the arrows thrust outwards. Imagine such a map of violent Islamic  fundamentalism. The countries already gone (Iran, Libya, Sudan, Afghanistan),  the violent allies (Iraq, Syria), the countries endangered and pressured:  Algeria, Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the Islamic areas of Russia.</P>  <P>This recognition of gathering storms, however, can lead in two directions.  One points, as it did in the 1930s, toward denial of the coherence and  imminence of the threat. It points toward a multiplicity of evasions: endless  studies and commissions, counter-terrorism by press conference, business-as-usual,  and the spurious either/or's &shy; defense versus civil liberties, for  example &shy; by which we too often manage to avoid the obvious. The other  way points toward the making of a decision which Americans have made three  times in the 20th century:</P>  <P>Not to withdraw from the world's violence. Not to try to live, as the  theologian Reinhold <I>Niebuhr once put it, as an &quot;island of relative  security in the middle of a global</I> hell.&quot;</P>  <P>But this time, there is a difference. When America made this decision  in the World Wars, the continental homeland was safe. When Americans made  this decision in the Cold War - certainly in the Cold War's second half  - the threat was so overwhelming that little could be done save to trust  in deterrence and hope for the best. This time, the American homeland is  vulnerable. And if the United States chooses to continue to exercise global  leadership, and especially to act in Islamic areas, <B>we're going to get  hit</B>.</P>  <P>If the American people wish to remain engaged with this planet, the  decision must be made in full knowledge of the terrible vulnerability involved.  Nor can there be doubt that, in the struggle against WMD, pre-emption,  prevention, and reprisal will be necessary and legitimate uses of power.  True, the criterion of military success will be what doesn't happen. But  things can &quot;not happen&quot; in many ways. And reprisal of a quality  to deter future attacks will be horrific.</P>  <P>To turn this purpose into policy, and this policy into strategy, two  other recognitions are necessary.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><UL>  <UL>    <LI>The defense of the homeland must come first. A truly isolationist America    would have scant need for defenses. Many would hate us, but few would have    reason to attack us, so long as we left them alone, bought their oil on    their terms, and ignored their crimes. Only an activist America requires    homeland defense. Further, this defense consists of an aggregate of activities,    from ballistic-missile and air defense against limited strikes to counter-terrorism,    drug interdiction, border security, information warfare, and protection    against violent domestic extremists. Currently, these activities are neither    conceived nor pursued as a coherent whole. They need to be.    <LI>The United States must choose its military commitments very carefully.    This excludes the use of the military for global social work, save in very    special circumstances. This also requires a considerable quantity of often    distasteful <I>ad </I>hoc arrangements, from alliances and technology sharing    to acceptance of the fact that (to borrow an Arab proverb) &quot;My enemy's    enemy is my friend&quot; . . . at least for today.  </UL></UL><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Turning Policy into Power.</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>A coherent, nondecadent military component of American security policy  must be based upon four recognitions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><UL>  <UL>    <LI><I>Today, the United States is involved in a unique, historically unprecedented,    </I>asymmetrical arms race. Historically, arms races involved discrete    political entities, i.e., nation-states, empires, or other political structures,    and were easily quantified. Ten tanks were better than five tanks, walls    could defend against chariots, x number of anti-aircraft guns could be    expect to bring down y number of enemy bombers. Today, however, the United    States concentrates on precision-guided weaponry, while the planetary bad    actors &shy; a category which includes far more than nation-states &shy;    build or acquire WMD along with crude but serviceable delivery systems,    from missiles and aircraft to tug boats and trucks. The problem is to make    American power effective against these threats. American conventional forces,    properly maintained and modernized, can defeat any conventional force on    earth. Everybody knows it. But that's only part of the task, and perhaps    not even the most important part. And a lot of people who wish us ill know    that, too.    <LI>However, modern technology provides an astonishing array of new options.    To understand this, it's necessary to go beyond the buzzwords: &quot;Information    Age Warfare,&quot; &quot;Digitizing the Battlefield,&quot; &quot;Third    Wave,&quot; etc. Go back a century. Things were simple. If it happened    on land, the Army did it. The Navy pursued its role at sea. Then the airplane    began to blur the distinction between land and sea combat. Hundreds of    new weapons and systems entered the forces. And a remarkable mixing and    matching began. You could put airplanes on ships: aircraft carriers. You    could put soldiers on airplanes: paratroops and airmobile operations. You    could put armies on ships and land them on defended beaches: the Marine    Corps and the great Army amphibious operations of World War II. You could    put missiles on submarines. The result of all this invention has been that    systems have proliferated, but effects have converged. The &quot;Microprocessor    Revolution&quot; in targeting and command, control, communications, and    intelligence has increased this convergence by orders of magnitude. For    example, in World War II, the best weapon against a tank was another tank;    there were only a couple other ways, none very effective, to do it. Today,    there are over a dozen different ways to fight tanks. It is now possible    to fight tanks with submarines &shy; submerged craft hundreds of miles    from the battle, firing cruise missiles with precision-guided submunitions.    It is now possible, as a recent Naval War College simulation showed, to    sink entire fleets without ever putting a hull in the water. This means    that systems are vulnerable. But it also means that power can be made relevant    to the tasks at hand in many ways.    <LI><I>Think multi-use</I>. Future weapons and systems procurement must    emphasize versatility. In one sense, this is nothing new. A fighter-bomber,    for example, is a good buy because it can attack ground targets or ships    and also fight other aircraft. But today, multi-use means more than different    roles on the battlefield: It means operating in different environments,    from conventional combat to homeland defense. The systems that protect    troops in the field from enemy missiles should be adaptable to protect    the homeland. Ships and aircraft protecting, say, Saudi Arabia, should    also be able to protect Puget Sound. Multi-use now means environments as    well as tasks.    <LI>Finally, this is an age of blurring boundaries. In security policy,    hitherto tidy distinctions between military and law enforcement functions    may begin to break down. Nobody wants a domestic security state; nobody    wants the military on every street corner. Nobody wants massive violations    of constitutional rights and civil liberties. Still, it may be necessary    to make some new divisions of labor for that twilight zone where terrorists,    guerrillas, and the homegrown demented operate. Fortunately, civil liberties    and homeland defense are not either/or, provided the challenge is met honestly,    openly, and publicly.  </UL></UL><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Now to ten specific recommendations The first five pertain to money,  the second five to changes in force structure, roles and missions, and  design philosophy:</P>  <P><B>1)</B> Don't cut the defense budget. Real spending is less than half  what it was ten years ago. Five years ago, two years ago, a case could  be made for further cuts. No more. In fiscal 1997, the Defense Department  appropriation is about $264 billion. $275 billion, in real dollars, should  be an adequate base.</P>  <P><B>2)</B> Stop raiding the accounts. Stop using operating money to pay  for peacekeeping, especially. Keep the procurement and R&amp;D accounts  strong.</P>  <P><B>3)</B> Privatize and outsource whenever possible. As a general rule,  if a function doesn't have to deploy anywhere, it can probably be done  better by civilians. This includes everything from aircraft depot maintenance  to mowing the lawns.</P>  <P><B>4) </B>Another round of base closures and realignments. These may  produce greater &quot;cost avoidance&quot; than real savings, but are necessary  nonetheless.</P>  <P><B>5) </B>Downsize. Cut uniformed end strength from the current 1.5  million to one million. Defense must become capital intensive. The days  of cheap &shy; and unskilled &shy; conscript labor are over. This is a  professional force. It is also older and more married; dependents are becoming  an increasingly expensive burden, expecially in medical care.</P>  <P><B>6) </B>Realign roles and missions. This means revisiting the National  Security Act of 1947 and subsequent legislation and agreements. Everything  should be on the table.</P>  <P><B>7)</B> Aerospace first. Aerospace in all its aspects is the great  American comparative advantage. It must be kept. As a general rule, whatever  can be done from the air, probably should be done from the air. Militarily  as well as economically, what's good for Boeing is good for America. And  it may not be too much of a stretch to suggest that, militarily, what's  good for Boeing is good for the world.</P>  <P><B>8)</B> Maintain a robust fleet of 400-450 ships, a 180,000 strong  Marine Corps, and a smaller but modernized Army and a revitalized National  Guard. Yes, &quot;boots on the ground&quot; &shy; the ability to take and  hold territory &shy; will always be necessary. But this tells us little  about how many boots, or how often they'll be used in the WMD era.</P>  <P><B>9) </B>Think multi-use always. This includes both systems and organizations.  The National Guard, for example, is a classic multi-use organization. Its  possibilities along the entire threat array, from homeland defense and  disaster relief to providing the nation's combat reserve for major war  should be explored and enhanced anew. The Guard, too often and too easily  dismissed as archaic, should be viewed from a &quot;clean slate&quot; perspective.  Only then will its enormous potential begin to become apparent.</P>  <P><B>10)</B> Homeland defense. Begin to consider whether and how, at some  point, it might be necessary to create a unified Home Defense Command with  military and civilian elements, subject to rigid civilian oversight and  protection of civil liberties. This isn't necessary now; hopefully, it  will never be needed. But the current arrangements, in which homeland defense  is parcelled out among literally hundreds of agencies and services, working  groups and task forces, may not be adequate to the threat ten or twenty  years from now.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusion</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>Will any of this come to pass, short of a major catastrophe? Hard to  tell. At the moment, in the think tank world certainly, working in defense  is time in the wilderness. Nobody's interested. Nobody's funding it. Perhaps  it will take a major civilian-military movement, akin to the defense reform  movement of the 1970s and 80s, or the airpower advocacies of the interwar  years, to bring it about. They too had their time in the wilderness.</P>  <P>Still, the wilderness can be a challenging place. You meet interesting  people there. And, sometimes, you get to do some good. If the current time  in the wilderness generates a movement that accomplished what the defense  reform and airpower people did, it will be time well spent.</P>  <P>Thank you.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="52%" SIZE="4"></CENTER></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Philip Gold is director of defense and  aerospace studies at the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based think tank,  and director of &quot;ReVisioning Defense: Protecting the People, Defending  the Defenders,&quot; in co-operation with the Heritage Foundation in Washington,  DC.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><FONT SIZE=-1><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></FONT></A><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="crsc1.html"><IMG SRC="crscbttn.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><AHREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</BODY></HTML>

Sam Beard, founder of the National Development Council and Fellow of Discovery
Institute, is an accomplished leader in economic development. Here now is
his carefully conceived and meticulously studied plan to save Social Security.
What makes his plan stunningly distinct is its potential to create real
economic opportunity for the three-quarters of Americans whose financial
situations prevent them from saving for their retirement.<BR>
<BR>
In university classrooms, senior centers, chambers of commerce and on talk
radio, Beard's proposal is being well-received by retirees, Babyboomers
and Generation X. Beards has undertaken this as his mission, and is disproving
the conventional expectation of generational divisions over any proposal
to change social security. Indeed, he is finding remarkable acceptance and
approval of his ideas in every venue.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B><BR>
<BR>
The message of this book cuts to the heart of a new revolution sweeping
across America.</B> The message addresses a concern you probably feel in
your gut as intensely as I do-a helplessness and insecurity about our nation's
future. It's a sentiment many of us are trying to communicate to our friends,
family members and politicians. Americans are worried about their country's
direction, and their political opinions are volatile. <BR>
<BR>
<B>For proof, we need only examine the results of recent national elections.</B>
We simply don't like the way things are going. We are looking for new answers,
and we are prepared to sweep out old ways for those that work. We desperately
want to believe that our actions make a difference. We want to know that
we still control our own destiny. When we believe we have job security,
the ability to get ahead, and that the safety and educational opportunities
of our children are assured, Americans feel their country is on the right
track. But these issues are among our most serious concerns today. We are
fed up, with the direction in which our government is leading us. We are
angry and very distrustful of our politicians. Americans in both parties-liberals
and conservatives-have the same concern: We are paying too much in taxes,
getting too little in return, and recklessly mortgaging our future. People
simply don't trust government solutions or our political leaders. Thus,
a new revolution is underway-redefining the role of government as it affects
people's lives and pocketbooks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><CENTER>Millions of Americans Are Angry and Frustrated</CENTER>
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Many of us are afraid that future opportunity is diminishing.</B>
When I interviewed people for this book, I asked, &quot;Will your children
have a higher standard of living and greater opportunities than you?&quot;
Eight out of ten immediately responded no- indicating they strongly believed
their children would have a lowerstandard of living and less opportunity.
This runs contrary to traditional American optimism. We pride ourselves
in working hard, and passing expanded opportunities on to our children.
America historically sees itself as a land of progress and dreams. But,
a majority of Americans today feel we are on a treadmill. We are angry.
And we are ready for change.</BLOCKQUOTE>

campaign.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>William Kristol, The Weekly Standard</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;...if we do not plan for the future, entitlement spending promises
will exceed financial resources in the next century. The current spending
trend is clearly unsustainable. In this creative book, Sam Beard lucidly
identifies some <BR>
of the problems in our Social Security system and proposes <BR>
innovative ways to solve them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>United States Senator (D) Bob Kerry </I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sam Beard's call for a national grassroots debate on these issues
is so vitally important for the future of the Social Security program. Beard
offers Americans a fresh, outside-the-beltway approach which deserves our
most serious and conscientious consideration.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>United States Senator (R) Alan K. Simpson</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sam Beard has devised the unassailable substitute for the Social Security
system, which even the AARP would approve of. Why didn't we think of it?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>William F. Buckley, Jr.</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sam Beard offers a creative plan to remodel Social Security for the
21st century while upholding that contract with today's seniors. ... His
plan not only protects seniors and ensures retirement security for future
generations, but promises economic growth and keeps the American Dream alive.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>Sandra L. Butler, President United Senior Association</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;As Social Security hurdles towards insolvency, Sam Beard offers an
innovative approach that might enable America to stave off entitlement collapse
and provide future generations with a vibrant retirement system. His recommendations
deserve serious analysis and consideration.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>Richard Thau, Jonathon Karl, Douglas Kennedy, Third Millennium</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Restoring Hope in America brings the looming Social Security crisis
to our attention - and presents a unique and thoughtful solution worth discussing!
... Everyone should read Restoring Hope in America and get involved in the
debate about Social Security.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

An agreement between the U.S. Department of Justice and an allegedly crime-ridden labor union is being scrutinized in Congress because of allegations that political considerations may have led the government to adopt a lenient stance toward the union. One aspect of the relations between the Clinton Administration and the Laborers' International Union of North America which merits particular examination is the string of federal grants that have continued to subsidize LIUNA even as government investigators were uncovering evidence of organized criminal influence in the union. Restriction or elimination of grants to politically active groups like unions ought to be high on the list of remedies Congress considers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In addition to examining the Clinton Administration's handling of criminal investigations, Congress should seek to ascertain why purely discretionary funds continued to flow to a group subject to such serious allegations. Were federal grantmakers aware of long-pending allegations that LIUNA was tied to organized crime? And in reviewing evidence that union leaders misused union funds, Congress should ask the General Accounting Office and other agencies to investigate how those same officials used taxpayer funds entrusted to them.
<p>
<b>Welfare for Unions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The vast patronage network created by Congress and the federal bureaucracy during the past 40 years is out of control. Each year, American taxpayers fund nearly $39 billion in grants to over 40,000 private organizations,<sup>1</sup> many of which taxpayers might find objectionable or offensive. Even when the advertised purpose of a federal grant seems inoffensive, every federal dollar that an organization receives frees private resources for other uses, including political and lobbying activities in pursuit of ever more government subsidies. Furthermore, most federal grants include an "overhead" allowance that directly subsidizes all of a recipient's activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Over the past few decades, labor unions have been among the major beneficiaries of federal largesse, receiving literally billions of dollars for educational, training, and construction programs.<sup>2</sup> The maze of federal grants to unions in areas ranging from job-training to AIDS education is so vast, and public disclosure so limited, that a precise figure is unavailable. One admittedly preliminary investigation uncovered $110 million in "direct subsidies" to unions between January 1993 to March 1994 from the Departments of Labor, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services alone.<sup>3</sup> And this is dwarfed by the indirect subsidies unions receive through worker training grants distributed by the states under the $3.4 billion federal Job Training Partnership Act.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This year, the AFL-CIO has earmarked $35 million to defeat conservative members of the 104th Congress. Yet federal grants to the AFL-CIO continue. In the midst of this campaign, for example, the AFL-CIO was awarded a "financial management training" grant of $400,000 by President Clinton's supposedly nonpartisan "national service" program, AmeriCorps.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	While any group should be free to pursue legitimate political aims, labor unions enjoy two unusual privileges: federal grant subsidies and the ability to force workers to subsidize political efforts with which many union members disagree. Both of these privileges allow organized labor to use dollars earned coercively-either from taxpayers through federal grants or from union members through mandatory dues payments-to support a narrow ideological agenda.
<p>


<b>Money, Crime, and Politics</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In addition to the question of whether politically active groups should receive federal funding, the lack of accountability in the federal grants process is disturbing. The Laborers' International Union of North America received more than $11 million in federal grant money in FY 1994. In the 1994 election cycle, LIUNA's political action committee, the Laborers' Political League, donated over $1 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates. Whether federal grant dollars effectively subsidized political activity is a legitimate subject of inquiry, but the grants to LIUNA raise an even more significant question: Why did LIUNA continue to receive millions in federal grant dollars when it had been singled out for a decade as probably infiltrated by organized crime?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In 1986, President Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime issued a landmark report detailing the influence of organized crime on labor unions. The report singled out several unions, suggesting in a chapter entitled "A Case Waiting to be Made" that the Justice Department file racketeering charges against the Laborers' International Union of North America to return control of the union to its members.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Eight years later, in November 1994, DOJ's organized crime and racketeering section delivered a 212-page draft complaint to LIUNA's general president, Arthur Coia. The charge: that Coia, along with several co-conspirators, had "employed actual and threatened force, violence and economic injury to create a climate of intimidation and fear" at the Rhode Island-based union, which represents 700,000 workers, primarily in the hazardous waste cleanup and construction trades. The complaint recommended that Coia be "immediately removed" from his post as general president and that control of the union be assumed by an independent administrator.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Over the past two decades, LIUNA officials have recorded over 80 convictions for crimes ranging from racketeering to bribery, extortion, tax evasion, and attempted murder. Despite this record and the lengthy Justice Department report detailing Coia's use of "fear and intimidation" in running the union, Coia was not removed as head of LIUNA. In February 1995, the Justice Department reached an agreement with the union by which Coia kept his job in exchange for a promise that he would weed out corruption.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	DOJ's voluntary agreement with LIUNA, proposed by the union in response to the 212-page draft complaint, was the first of its kind in a racketeering case involving a labor union. It relies on LIUNA itself-not a court-appointed officer granted wide powers and broad access to federal investigative resources-to institute needed reforms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In the consent decree filed by LIUNA and DOJ, the union acknowledged that "the organized crime syndicate known as La Cosa Nostra has at various times had a corrupting influence on the affairs of various locals and other entities within LIUNA." The union also openly admitted that it "ha[d] not eliminated all of such corrupting influence" in its ranks.<sup>5</sup> In effect, the "Department of Justice farm[ed] out the task of mob-busting to a union boss they once charged as a racketeer."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime recently held hearings in conjunction with the tenth anniversary of the Reagan Commission to examine how LIUNA remained under Coia's thumb. One theory is that politics may have played a role.<sup>7</sup> Coia lent $100,000 of LIUNA money to the Clinton Inaugural Committee; and in 1993 and 1994, the Laborers' Political League donated over $1 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates. During 1995 and the first quarter of 1996, the LPL has contributed $747,000 to over 200 liberal congressional candidates. Coia personally served as vice chairman of a May 1996 fund-raiser that raised $12 million for the Democratic Party.
<p>
<b>LIUNA and Federal Grants</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In addition to reviewing the Justice Department's decision to allow Coia to remain as LIUNA's general president, the Judiciary Committee might wish to investigate federal funding of the union's training programs. Since 1986, millions of tax dollars have flowed to this union, described by the Commission on Organized Crime as a "corrupt" organization whose "leaders steal or misuse workers' funds." Moreover, the November 1994 Justice Department complaint noted that "in or about 1986 to on or about July 31, 1994," LIUNA leaders intended to devise a scheme to "defraud training and education funds of various upstate locals" in New York by using "actual and threatened force" to "induce the locals to surrender control of these funds."<sup>8</sup> In FY 1994, while the Justice Department was investigating graft and intimidation at LIUNA, the union and its affiliates received 38 grants totaling $11,376,000 from four federal agencies and departments: the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Labor.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In April 1995, less than three months after the Justice Department signed its agreement with LIUNA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development signed its own agreement with the union. HUD awarded the Laborers' Institute for Training and Education, a LIUNA affiliate, a $3.5 million grant to "provide construction and environmental training and career opportunities and advancement for public housing residents."<sup>10</sup> Under this grant, according to LIUNA, public housing residents will be trained in "basic construction and environmental remediation skills," after which they will "become members of LIUNA" and "enjoy long-term access to future employment opportunities through union hiring halls." It is little wonder that, upon receiving this grant, Coia declared that "this is just one more shining example of how the Clinton administration and the LIUNA is [sic] putting people first."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Congress should call additional hearings to require the relevant grantmaking officials at HUD to testify about their decision to award such a major grant to LIUNA just three months after the consent decree was signed. In particular, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Joseph Shuldiner, who signed the April 26, 1995, grant, should be asked about his knowledge of wrongdoing at LIUNA as well as what efforts his bureau is taking to prevent such wrongdoing in the future.
<p>
<b>Lessons for the Federal Grants Process</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	LIUNA is just one of the nearly 40,000 private organizations that receive more than $39 billion annually in federal grant funds. Like LIUNA, many of these groups also take an active part in the political process by promoting a particular ideological agenda or by lobbying for increased federal spending. When the taxpayers fund special interests, they make it possible for these organizations to use private resources for such purposes. The federal grants process employs the coercive power of government to force taxpayers to finance organizations whose political agenda they oppose. With regard to LIUNA specifically, tax dollars have gone repeatedly to an organization whose leadership has played a significant role in supporting the Democratic Party.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Wholly aside from LIUNA's links to the Clinton Administration, organizations alleged to be rife with criminal wrongdoing should be ineligible for federal funding. Clearly, federal grant dollars should not be given to any organization with admitted ties to organized crime for the purpose of recruiting more members. Whatever other else might be done to prevent the abuse of federal grants for political purposes, this is a first step upon which liberals and conservatives alike should be able to agree.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As Congress reviews charges that LIUNA officials misused union funds, government investigators should be asked whether they reviewed the receipt and use of taxpayer funds by those same officials. Given the union's admission of wrongdoing, an investigation and accounting of the use of recent federal grants clearly is in order. Because of questions about the relationship between the Clinton Administration and LIUNA, the General Accounting Office, an independent congressional agency, should conduct that review.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The LIUNA case is an example of the inherent conflict of interest in permitting executive branch agencies to give grants to politically active groups. In 1995, Congress attempted to address the problem of taxpayer-subsidized political activities by ending grants to groups that engage in lobbying. Unfortunately, the restriction Congress approved applies only to one category of lobbying organization, and efforts to erect broader restrictions on federally funded lobbying, principally the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment, were stymied by congressional liberals. Along with general efforts to eliminate welfare for lobbyists, Congress should identify and eliminate all programs that serve most often to channel funding to special-interest groups.<sup>11</sup> This case should serve to stimulate such efforts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	As Congress questions the standard for criminal prosecution in cases such as LIUNA's, it also should consider an intermediate step: barring federal grants to suspect organizations. During the ten years that allegations against LIUNA have been pending, government grantmakers appear to have been uninformed of or unconcerned about substantial evidence of criminal activity within the union. Because federal grants to organizations like LIUNA are discretionary, it would be entirely reasonable to withhold money from suspect groups and award it to others. Government should take all reasonable steps to protect taxpayer funds even before seeking criminal sanctions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Congress should consider steps to stop-or at least require a review of-federal grants to any group for which there is substantial evidence of corruption. Among the actions which might trigger such a review:
<ul>
 <p><li>Conviction of a group's officers or employees on charges indicating abuse of monies or organizational powers;
 
 <p><li>Delivery or filing of charges against an organization by federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies; or
 
<p><li>Any public disclosure of criminal activity by an organization.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Having raised serious legal concerns about the propriety of the Clinton Administration's decision to allow the crime-infested Laborer's International Union to remain out of federal receivership, Congress also should ask why such an organization has continued to receive federal grant subsidies. LIUNA presents a case study of serious problems in the federal grants process. Since 1993, the Laborers' Political League has donated nearly $1.75 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates. At the same time, LIUNA affiliates have received over $15 million in federal grants. Indeed, just three months after it admitted to organized crime infiltration in federal court, LIUNA received a $3.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;



	It is time for Congress to end the corruption of the federal grants process by acting immediately to:<ul>

 <p><li><b>Require</b> that relevant grantmakers at HUD, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor testify about their knowledge of allegations of criminal infiltration of LIUNA;
 
 <p><li><b>Prohibit</b> organizations whose officers have records of criminal wrongdoing from receiving federal grants;
 
 <p><li><b>Renew</b> efforts to restrict lobbying by federal grantees; and
 
<p><li><b>Order</b> a General Accounting Office investigation into LIUNA's handling of federal grants.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	It is bad enough that mandatory dues from union members are used to pay for corruption and political activities. Taxpayers should not be forced to pay as well.

<title>Questioning the Bosnia Peace Plan -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>QUESTIONING THE BOSNIA PEACE PLAN</i></h3>
By John Hillen<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1062<br>
November 30, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The recent conclusion of a <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/current/bosnia/bosagree.html">Bosnian peace accord</a> is a welcome development in a brutal conflict that has raged unchecked for four years. However, there are very serious questions that need to be answered about the political viability of the accord and the effectiveness of the American military intervention to implement it.
<p>
In his nationally televised address on November 27, President Clinton stated that he will request congressional support for the deployment of over 20,000 <a href=" http://www.dtic.dla.mil/bosnia/">American ground troops</a> to Bosnia. The President will also have to convince a very skeptical U.S. public that the sacrifice of American lives and resources is worth the short-term results he hopes to achieve. Most important, the President will have to convince both Congress and the American people that he has not committed American troops to an open-ended and ill-defined military mission in the midst of a volatile civil war.
<P>
To assess fully the tough political and military issues involved, Congress should be prepared to ask the President specific questions about the practicalities of the Bosnian peace plan and about the risks and costs associated with an American military intervention that would implement such a plan.
<p>

<b>QUESTIONS ABOUT POLITICAL VIABILITY</b>
<p>

<b>Q. Is a bifurcated Bosnian state a realistic and sustainable political entity? </b>
<p>
The <a href="http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/bosagree.html">Bosnian peace accord</a> proposes a Bosnia-Herzegovina that has the appearance of a single state, but is in fact based on two separate political entities -- the Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic. For the central organs of Bosnia to function as intended, the two separate entities will have to show the most extraordinary goodwill and cooperation toward each other, qualities that have never been in evidence in Bosnia. 
<p>
Many experienced diplomats have expressed skepticism about the political viability of this Bosnian state and the realistic chances of its survival as a centrally governed and coherent nation. Former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski has stated that the accord is a contrived peace that actually creates "two and a half states."<sup>1</sup><p>Much of this skepticism is rooted in the fact that the accord does not address fundamental issues of sovereignty and ethnic self-determination. Instead, it freezes those unresolved issues in place and offers up an elaborate power-sharing agreement for a Bosnian central government. However, it will be difficult for a contrived central government to replace the bonds of loyalty, authority, and legitimacy that currently exist between Bosnian Croats and Croatia and Bosnian Serbs and Serbia. These bonds are rooted in centuries of political, ethnic, and cultural identity and are sure to prove stronger than bonds to a hastily fabricated central government. 
<p>
This central dilemma was noted recently by Swedish diplomat Thomas Gur, who wrote that this "peace plan has many built-in contradictions and weaknesses. Many of the proposed arrangements lay the groundwork for possible new conflicts between different minorities, and for future interventions by Serbia as well as Croatia. If the arrangements for peace in Bosnia are carried out according to the peace plan, new conflicts will be triggered by old ones."<sup>2</sup><p>If history is any guide, this agreement stands little chance of lasting. In Cyprus in 1964, international negotiators reached a similar agreement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Much like the Bosnian agreement, the doomed Cyprus accord attempted to replace bonds to the "parent entities" for both sides (Greece and Turkey) with an unworkable central executive and ethnically aligned parliamentary blocs. This ensured continued intractability. This structure never worked because it never addressed the fundamental fears and aspirations of the warring factions and was predicated on a diplomatic fantasy:  hopes for a degree of cooperation that had never been present in Cyprus. After 10 years of sporadic fighting and instability under this makeshift arrangement, Turkey invaded the island in 1974, partitioned Cyprus, and put an end to the ephemeral peace -- an imposed peace that was never locally supported. United Nations peacekeepers have been in Cyprus for over 30 years. 
<p>
The same pattern can be expected in Bosnia. How can an imposed peace that does not reflect political realities or the basic concerns of the warring factions hope to survive except by the continued enforcement of thousands of NATO and American troops?  The recently concluded Bosnian peace accord is inherently weak because it fails to address the fundamental issues that caused the parties to go to war in the first place. It is, at best, a cease-fire that can work only under the continued stewardship of 60,000 heavily armed NATO combat troops.<sup>3 </sup><p><b>Q. Is the Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation itself a politically sustainable arrangement? </b>
<p>
The entire peace accord is predicated on the notion that the Muslim/Croat Federation is a solid political entity that can be endowed with more political and military resources and that will continue to grow in cohesiveness as an uneasy counterweight to the Bosnian Serb Republic. There is considerable doubt about the solidarity of this alliance, which came about as a marriage of convenience in 1994.
<p>
Before that federation was formed, the Croats and Muslims fought a brutal war for control of cities such as Mostar in Bosnia. Contentious territorial and refugee issues remain to be settled between the two groups. Many observers believe that the Muslim/Croat Federation started to come apart as soon as there was no imminent Serbian threat to hold it together. A U.N. official in Zagreb recently noted that "the American plan rests on the assumption that the Muslim-Croat federation is solid. Maybe that plan is built on sand."<sup>4</sup><p><b>Q. Is this peace accord locally supported? </b>
<P>
While Slobodan Milosevic purports to speak for the Bosnian Serb leaders, local support is far from guaranteed. Since 1992, the Bosnian Serbs have reneged twice on deals backed by President Milosevic. If anything, initial signs have been distressing. All three Bosnian Serbs present at the Dayton peace talks refused to sign the peace accord, and Bosnian Serb leaders denounced the accord within hours of its initialing. Since then Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo have staged protests and their leader, Radovan Karadzic, has insisted that the Sarajevo provisions of the peace accord doom that city to the fate of Beirut and must be renegotiated. The leader of the Bosnian Serb Parliament stated that "the agreement that has been reached does not meet even the minimum of our interests."<sup>5</sup>  In addition to these and other signs of a possible split between Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leaders, there are many different factions within the Muslim and Croat camps, all with local ambitions and aspirations. It must be remembered that there is very little central control over many paramilitary elements ostensibly connected with one of the three sides. These include, among others, the 1,000 Mujahideen militia fighters from Iran, Afghanistan, and elsewhere who recently have attacked British forces in Bosnia and are suspected of murdering an American working for the U.N. near Tuzla.<sup>6</sup><p><b>Q. What issues remain unresolved, and how does the Bosnian peace accord address those problems? </b>
<p>
It is not a good sign that some of the thorniest issues raised at <a href="http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/bosagree.html">Dayton</a> were left unresolved. In particular, the dispute over the Serbian corridor around Brcko was left to be submitted to binding arbitration by a panel made up of Muslims, Serbs, and Europeans. The content, character, method, and authority of the arbitration were not specified. Also not addressed were specifics about how to integrate the two (or possibly three) rival armies into one that would serve the foreign policies of the central government, and specific measures to ensure that indicted war criminals would be brought to trial.
<p>
<b>Q. What long-term commitment has the U.S. made to the continued security of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in its planned form? </b>
<p>
Even if the bulk of U.S. ground troops leave within 12 to 18 months, the United States will incur some form of continuing security obligation to Bosnia. President Clinton not only must define clearly the exact nature of that commitment, but also must identify the strategic resources he intends to allocate to that commitment and the contingency plans he will ask the military to prepare. The commitment of the United States to the continued existence of this state of Bosnia-Herzegovina will certainly go beyond the initial use of American troops on the ground in Bosnia. This was very much the case, for example, after the liberation of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. Since 1991, the United States has been heavily engaged in defending Kuwait, undertaking operations such as "Vigilant Warrior" in October 1994, which sent thousands of American soldiers to Kuwait on almost no notice. In addition, President Clinton just announced an extension of the U.S. military presence in Haiti. A similar commitment to Bosnia needs to be factored into the strategic, operational, logistical, resources, and fiscal planning of the military.
<p>

<b>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION FORCE</b>
<p>
There also are serious questions about the military feasibility of <a href="gopher://marvin.stc.nato.int:70/11/yugo">NATO's</a> Implementation Force (IFOR).
<p>
<b>Q. What are the defined and measurable military objectives for this peace implementation mission? </b>
<p>
The military mission in Bosnia will be so-called peace implementation. This is a term invented by the Clinton Administration to describe a dangerous and ambiguous mission that will be improvised on the ground and made up as it goes along. In 1994, after an intensive study of the dynamics of post-Cold War peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations, the <a href="http://www.army.mil">U.S. Army</a> released a comprehensive doctrinal manual entitled <i>Peace Operations</i>. This manual describes how the U.S. military will operate in various peace support missions, including support for diplomacy, peacemaking, peace building, preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping, and peace enforcement. "Peace implementation" is not addressed.
<p>
When the U.S. military is given a task, it must be one which it understands and one for which it has trained. Clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives must be identified, and these objectives must contribute directly to the political goals of the operation. There are significant doubts about the existence of such objectives in the Bosnia peace implementation force. The United States must be able to measure the success of operations and formulate an exit strategy that leaves something sustainable behind. It brings to mind the confusion felt by Marines in Lebanon when they were asked to go ashore in 1982 and "establish a presence."  That is not a defined military mission. It is merely a deployment of troops without a realizable mission.
<p>
<b>Q. Why will American forces work under self-imposed restraints? </b>
<p>
Peacekeeping, peace enforcement, or even peace implementation are missions that depend ultimately on the goodwill of the warring factions in order to succeed. There is no question of trying to coerce all factions into a pattern of behavior with only 60,000 NATO troops (of whom fewer than 20,000 will be "trigger pullers"). The bottom line for the American armed forces is that they will be in a mission that places U.S. troops in a strategically passive posture. 
<p>
After the Vietnam war and the 1983 disaster in Lebanon, American political and military officials formulated a comprehensive doctrine ensuring that when U.S. troops are deployed into imminent hostilities, it is with a coherent strategy and every conceivable operational advantage. One condition guaranteed to the military is that they will receive a mission that allows American forces the operational freedom and resources to keep the initiative of action -- to dictate the terms of battle to their advantage. This allows American military forces to create the conditions they need to succeed. It is a formula that worked brilliantly in Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm, and even in peace operations like the initial U.S.-led humanitarian relief effort by President Bush in Somalia. 
<P>
The Bosnia peace implementation plan does the opposite. It strips any advantage from American ground forces and places U.S. troops in a passive and reactive posture. It gives the initiative of action to the warring factions and ensures that, regardless of U.S. action, the warring factions will be the sole determinants of mission success.
<p>
Secretary of Defense William Perry has tried to pre-empt the inevitable criticism of this static and passive military role for American forces by insisting that the U.S. will be "the meanest dog in town."  This gives the U.S. the opportunity to respond to tactical attacks, but still within a strategically passive mission. It raises again the specter of strategic incoherence that was so prevalent in U.S. strategy during the Vietnam war. While the U.S. may "win" all the little fights on the ground in Bosnia, the entire effort may have nothing to show for its "victories" at the end of the mission. 
<p>
Being the "meanest dog in town" is no advantage in Bosnian terrain that negates the U.S. superiority in armor and maneuver. It is no advantage against a foe who, in the words of strategist Andrew Krepinevich, will be more likely to attack U.S. forces as "fleas, and not another dog."<sup>7</sup>  It is no advantage when the U.S. is kept chained by a passive and static strategy that deprives the U.S. of the operational advantages of effective military doctrine. This mission will give the U.S. forces all the political constraints and liabilities of traditional peacekeeping, but with all the dangers and expenses of an enforcement operation -- and with no control over the results. Peace implementation combines the worst of both worlds, with no guarantee that the benefits of American intervention will outweigh the costs.
<p>
<b>Q. How will American forces know when they have accomplished their mission and are ready to leave? </b>
<p>
In order for the U.S. to avoid "mission creep" -- the unintended and unanticipated acceptance of new missions and new mandates -- it must stick to a comprehensive and clearly articulated strategy that lays out military objectives and a clear exit strategy. President Clinton stated in his national address that the mission in Bosnia would be clear, limited, and achievable. For that to be true, clearly defined and easily measurable military criteria must be identified at all levels of the military effort:  strategic, operational, and tactical. The prospects and costs of achieving these criteria also must be clearly stated. 
<p>
The <a href="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/bosnia/">American and NATO forces</a> deployed to Bosnia have very broad powers that extend to disarmament, refugee resettlement, election security, and even nation-building. A workable military campaign plan must reconcile those sweeping and comprehensive powers with the President's wish to keep the mission clear, limited, and achievable; it is inconsistent to state that the mission will be limited and at the same time plan for the forces to accomplish something politically sustainable. President Clinton has maintained all along that this deployment will be limited in scope, but the peace accord opens the door for NATO peacekeepers to perform many nation-building activities such as ensuring the free movement and resettlement of refugees, aiding humanitarian workers, resolving boundary disputes, creating secure conditions for free elections, and responding to violence against civilians.
<p>
Having multiple missions requires the military to have different criteria for success in these many tasks. In addition, the criteria for success at lower levels must add up to success at higher levels. The U.S. should not repeat the mistakes of the Vietnam war, in which criteria for success such as body counts and ammunition expenditure were ultimately irrelevant to the strategic and political outcome. Criteria should be easily measurable and must lead ultimately to an exit strategy. The exit strategy for a successful Bosnian peace implementation force must be driven by events, not by time as the President has suggested. It also cannot just reflect a "checklist" of tasks for American forces to accomplish. The exit strategy must be constructed with the intention of leaving behind a locally supported peace that does not require an open-ended commitment of American troops. In addition, in the very likely event that something does not go according to plan, several different exit strategies must be included in contingency plans. All possible eventualities must be planned for in military  operations.
<p>
<b>Q. How do American forces intend to avoid "mission creep?" </b>
<p>
Even with clearly defined, limited, achievable, and measurable objectives, U.S. forces can be subject to mission creep and escalatory fighting. The broad authority granted to NATO troops is a well-intentioned attempt by military planners to give the passively postured U.S. troops some measure of control over their environment and to help them minimize their risks and casualties. However, it also plants the seeds for mission creep and open-ended commitments. Ironically, the dynamics of mission creep and escalation will be most likely to take root when U.S. soldiers do the smart thing in response to aggression.
<p>
For instance, responding to attacks with "robust" rules of engagement will necessarily mean offensive combat operations. Vice President Al Gore noted recently that "if challenged, [American troops] will respond with brutal and overwhelming force... not just to provocations, but to evident intent."<sup>8</sup>  This aggressive attitude is in keeping with successful military doctrine, but it also presents a hazardous dilemma to American forces. If U.S. forces respond only to the immediate source of low-level attacks or threatened attacks (snipers, mortal teams, small paramilitary units), they run the risk of expending considerable resources in an attempt to swat a fly with a sledgehammer. If, however, as the Vice President implies, the U.S. commander chooses the far more effective option of responding to the primary source of the attack (local command headquarters, larger units, or leaders), then the action could easily deepen U.S. involvement. Robust rules of engagement are truly a double-edged sword in an intervention that is supposed to remain "limited."  By being tough and going after the "source" of the attack, the U.S. could escalate the conflict and lead to retaliations which require even harsher responses from the U.S. side.
<p>
The most poignant example of this occurred in Somalia. In June 1993, 24 Pakistani peacekeepers were killed by a mob of Somalis that included women and children. Instead of attempting to ferret out the responsible parties from within a surging street mob, the U.N. commander asked the U.S. to help him hit the source of the attack -- General Mohammed Farah Aideed. The U.S. then launched a series of limited offensive attacks to cut down Aideed's military power base and capture Aideed himself. This drew the U.S. deeper into the Somali conflict and gave American troops a new status as one more local faction in the Somali wars. All of this was brought on by robust rules of engagement. Although President Clinton talked tough in his November 27 speech, there are considerable risks and costs involved with "fighting fire with fire, and then some." As James Webb, former Secretary of the Navy and a highly decorated Vietnam combat veteran observed, the Bosnia rules of engagement are "a formula for confusion once a combat unit sent on a distinctly noncombat mission comes under repeated attack."<sup>9</sup><p>American troops will want to respond with disproportionate force in order to deter or discourage further attacks. However, the use of force always tends to draw all sides into further confrontation. Recent history provides unambiguous evidence of this. Attempts to undertake coercive disarmament or use robust rules of engagement in a peacekeeping-type operation failed in U.N. operations in the Congo in 1960-1964 and the former Yugoslavia and in U.S. missions in Lebanon (1982-1983) and Somalia (1992-1994). NATO's Implementation Force will be caught in a dilemma:  The more aggressively it operates, the better its chances of success and force protection, but also the more it will get drawn into the conflict and be seen as yet another warring faction.
<p>
<b>Q. Will the early withdrawal of American forces be supported by European allies, or will it cause the mission to collapse? </b>
<p>
Clinton has anticipated that American troops will be withdrawn within one year. In fact, the peace accord opens the possibility that the redeployment of American forces could begin as early as six months into the operation. European allies have universally condemned President Clinton's proposed timetable for American forces in Bosnia. President Chirac of France has predicted an armed NATO presence that could last up to 20 years. The United States intends to leave within 12 months because American public support would never tolerate a protracted and costly intervention in an area of marginal strategic interest to America. However, this action could damage U.S. credibility even further. 
<p>
In addition, local belligerents from all three factions who stand to gain by a continued American military presence are very likely to try to prevent U.S. withdrawal. In the past two years, U.N. units in Bosnia have been attacked by "friendly" factions opposed to their withdrawal or redeployment. The history of peacekeeping or peace enforcement does not offer many instances in which heavily involved forces have been able to make a quick and graceful exit. This brings to mind the Duke of Wellington's classic admonition that "Great nations do not fight small wars."  This reflects the fact that great powers cannot skip blithely in and out of conflicts. Once the prestige, honor, blood, and treasure of the United States are engaged, the U.S. will have to see the intervention through to its conclusion.
 <p>
<b>Q. What are the American contingency plans to deal with resistance to the efforts of the Implementation Force? </b><p>

Military commanders with experience in the Balkans have emphasized that U.S. forces are certain to encounter resistance from armed elements in Bosnia.<sup>10</sup>  President Clinton has stated that should the peace accord break down, U.S. troops would withdraw rather than stay in the midst of renewed civil war. A complete breakdown is not likely to happen because all parties benefit in the short run from the opportunity to rest and re-arm. It is far more likely that there will be sporadic and local levels of resistance and intransigence, in which case the United States will have only three bad options:  the "Northern Ireland option," in which the U.S. struggles on with the original mandate of the mission, accepting the casualties and continued commitment to the operation with no easily achievable end-state in sight; the "Vietnam option," in which the U.S. reinforces its forces and expands its mission and rules of engagement in order to try to force a solution through a more significant military effort; or the "Lebanon or Somalia option," in which the U.S. simply gives up and goes home. Any prolonged resistance could force the U.S. military in Bosnia into one of these options. There is no easy way out in Bosnia, especially in light of the resistance that can be anticipated. 
<p>
<b>Q. How does the U.S. plan to assume a peacekeeping role, train and arm the Bosnian Muslims, and supervise or enforce a "build-down" of Serbian armaments all at the same time? </b>
<p>
The implementation plan calls for the Bosnian Serbs to "reduce their military potential to the level where it is no longer a threat to the federation. If the Bosnian Serbs do not disarm, the United States has given assurances to the Bosnian government that it will level the playing field by equipping and training the Bosnian army."<sup>11</sup>  There are many questions still to be answered about the modalities of this mission and what role U.S. forces will play. The IFOR has broad powers under the agreement, including the power to remove or relocate certain units or weapons that it feels may threaten the mission. This will entail an active and most likely coercive role for IFOR. In addition, it remains to be seen how Bosnian Serb military potential will be measured, who will do the measuring, and exactly what types of coercive action will be taken against factions that refuse to disarm. 
<p>
In Somalia the U.S. discovered that the same force cannot act as a neutral peacekeeper and conduct coercive disarmament at the same time. It is a proven formula for disaster. Another lesson was that coercive and comprehensive disarmament very rapidly draws the coercer into the conflict. The initial American-led operation in Somalia gave American forces circumscribed and localized rules of engagement that allowed U.S. troops to disarm Somalis who immediately threatened U.S. operations. However, the nation-building mandate of the U.N.-led operation in Somalia greatly increased the mandate for disarmament, and in 1993 U.N. forces began aggressively to seek out the arms caches of warring factions in Mogadishu. This led directly to the disastrous street battle of October 3, 1993, in which 18 U.S. soldiers were killed and over 75 wounded. 
<p>
The only other option for a disarmament plan such as the one written into the Bosnian peace accord is to ignore those factions that refuse to disarm and hope that they choose to remain passive. This is what the United Nations did in Cambodia in 1992-1993. When the Khmer Rouge refused to honor the disarmament provisions of the Cambodian peace treaty, the U.N. commander knew it would be folly to try to coerce over 50,000 Khmer Rouge guerrillas into disarmament. The U.N. commander's plan instead was to "ride his luck"<sup>12</sup> and hope the Khmer Rouge did not disrupt the Cambodian elections or peace process. He knew that to pursue reluctant belligerents could draw his troops into a long, bloody, and fruitless contest. The same dilemma will confront the IFOR in Bosnia:  Pursue disarmament at great cost and risk escalating the fighting, or ignore intransigent belligerents and "hope" for their goodwill and cooperation.
<p>
In addition to these problems, any perception of American evenhandedness will be compromised by the plan to arm the Bosnian Muslims or Croats. European allies have strongly resisted the U.S. plan to arm and train the Muslims. However, the key to lasting peace in the Balkans is a local balance of power, and it is doubtful that this can be achieved without lifting the arms embargo (scheduled to be lifted 90 days after the peace accord is signed in Paris) and training the Muslims. Either way, the mission to "level the playing field" is fraught with difficulty for an outside party trying to create and sustain the subtleties of a local standoff in Bosnia.
<p>
<b>Q. Will the command and control structure worked out with the Russians stand up to the pressures of the mission? </b>
<p>
Command and control structures must be responsive, authoritative, rehearsed, and legitimate. Most important, they must be organized to handle the stress and strain of a "worst case scenario."  An authoritative command and control structure can offer a framework for action and response when military missions are faced with dangerous and contentious situations. The arrangement worked out with Russia looks reasonable on paper, but is likely to break down under pressure. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has stated that the Russian commander and the national authorities in Moscow have veto power over orders issued to the Russian contingent by the U.S. commander. This sort of arrangement can elevate tactical disagreements to a political level and exacerbate friction between the U.S. and Russia. The Administration would do well to heed an old military aphorism:  "If you cannot explain the command and control structure in less than 10 seconds, it isn't going to work."
<p>
Because goals and objectives are hard to define in a peace enforcement operation of this sort, European, American, and Russian policy could diverge to a great degree, as it has in the recent past. Much the same happened in Somalia. In the absence of clearly defined and measurable military goals, peace enforcement forces from different nations approached their mission in very different ways. This divergence caused the U.S. to insist on the removal of the Italian commander in Somalia. Imagine the imbroglios that could develop among the U.S., Russia, and the Europeans after NATO and Russian troops start dying in Bosnia. Peace enforcement is yet to be proven as a viable military concept, and its lack of conceptual and practical clarity means that when the shooting starts, everybody interprets the mandates in different ways. Failure to address these issues within a workable command and control framework could cause a further deterioration of alliance solidarity.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Very serious questions remain about the recently concluded Bosnia peace accord. The political plan is admittedly tenuous, as evidenced by the fact that its implementation requires some 60,000 NATO combat troops. The fact is that this accord cannot succeed without clearly evident local support. Among the many questions that remain to be answered are those concerning the political viability of a hastily cobbled-together Bosnian state whose planned structure does not clearly address the fundamental political aims and concerns of the previously warring parties. A peace accord does not necessarily make the peace, and it must be remembered that some Nobel Prize-winning accords, such as the 1974 Vietnam peace settlement, have collapsed in ignominy because they did not address the basic issues at hand.
<p>
In addition, the military strategy of the peace implementation plan must undergo a rigorous examination to determine whether the objectives and modus operandi of the Implementation Force represent a sound and coherent plan for NATO. There is an inherent contradiction between the President's stated desire to keep the mission "clear, limited, and achievable" and the sweeping authority given to the NATO force in areas such as disarmament, refugee resettlement, and nation-building. In addition, contingency plans to address all manner of resistance must be addressed categorically. Calculations about costs, benefits, and the probability of success must be applied to all possible circumstances and discussed fully. 
<p>
The Bosnian peace plan is a tremendously risky enterprise. All of the factors involved in its implementation must be fully understood and debated before American lives and prestige are put on the line in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defending American freedom, security, and prosperity from foreign threats requires that America remain militarily strong and preserve its military alliances. It is no accident that the U.S. became involved in World War I and World War II during the first half of the 20th century when it was essentially a regional military power, still disinclined to exercise global leadership. Nor is it an accident that there have been no world wars and few major U.S. wars since America's emergence as a global power and leader of the West after 1945. The lesson of history is clear: The best way to keep the United States out of costly major wars is to remain a global power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's status as a global power, however, could be in danger. The refusal of the Clinton Administration and Congress to provide adequate funding and other support for national security programs could leave the U.S. no longer able to make good on its commitments to military alliances in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. Analysts at the Heritage Foundation estimate that the Clinton Administration is underfunding its defense plan for fiscal years 1997-2002 by some $130 billion. If not corrected, this shortfall will leave America with a serious mismatch between its security commitments and the military capabilities needed to fulfill those commitments. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The time is rapidly approaching when this mismatch may force the nation to abandon at least some of its security commitments. Indeed, the time is rapidly approaching when the U.S. will have to decide between remaining a global power capable of preventing wars or becoming a mere regional military power, condemned to fight and possibly lose them.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress needs to sound the alarm over this problem. Congress also needs to conduct a serious debate on how to close the gap. One solution would be to pledge the nation to honor its existing security commitments and propose increasing the defense budget over projected levels to meet these commitments. If Congress and the Administration are not willing to support a defense budget and force levels sufficient to honor U.S. security commitments, they will leave America with only one feasible course of action: partial withdrawal from existing U.S. security commitments while projected defense spending levels are held steady.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This second approach is not a solution, but an evasion. It would mean the end of America as a global military power capable of defending its freedom and interests. And it would mean the beginning of a new age of insecurity of the sort that Americans have not known since the first half of this century.
<p>
<b>U.S. SECURITY COMMITMENTS AND MILITARY CAPABILITIES: THE COMING MISMATCH</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the heart of the emerging mismatch between U.S. military capabilities and security commitments is declining funding for defense. Since 1985, U.S. defense spending has declined by about 35 percent (through the end of the last fiscal year, or FY 1995). Both Administration and congressional budget proposals would result in an FY 2002 defense budget that is between 6 percent and 8 percent below the level prevailing in 1995 (see <a href="bg1083c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Reductions of this magnitude mean that the force structure recommended by the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review cannot be sustained.<sup>1</sup>  In fact, the defense budget proposed by the Clinton Administration for fiscal years 1997 through 2002 falls roughly $130 billion short of what is required for the President's proposed force structure. In other words, the Clinton Administration is failing to fund its own defense force, and the size of the U.S. armed forces will shrink to levels below those recommended in the Administration's own Bottom-Up Review (see <a href="bg1083c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and defense critics in Congress have explained the reduction in resources for the military as a natural result of the end of the Cold War. However, while defense budgets and force structure have diminished, U.S. security commitments have not changed. These commitments are derived from such important security treaties as the Washington Treaty of 1949 establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Japanese-United States Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaties of 1951 and 1960 (see <a href="bg1083c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). Other non-treaty commitments, such as those to U.S. friends in the Persian Gulf, also remain in force. In addition, at the same time President Clinton is cutting defense, he is seeking to expand the level of American military commitments by increasing U.S. participation in peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations and expanding NATO membership to qualifying states in Eastern Europe.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of these commitments place an extraordinary drain on the resources of the armed services. The Clinton Administration's policy calls for the Army to have ten active divisions, but the Administration's underfunding is likely to force down the number of active divisions to eight. U.S. security commitments to the countries of the Persian Gulf (in this case non-treaty commitments) oblige the U.S. to confront an attack on its friends in the region by either Iraq or Iran. As a result of this commitment, America could find itself fighting another Persian Gulf War, say in 2005. But sending the same number of active Army combat divisions to a future war in the Persian Gulf as were sent in 1990/91 would require more than seven divisions -- at least 70 percent of active Army divisions called for under the Bottom-Up Review, and 87 percent of the active divisions likely to result from Clinton Administration budget policy. Similar demands would exist for the combat forces of the other services (see <a href="bg1083c4.gif">Chart 4</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The demand placed on military support systems by U.S. security commitments cannot be quantified as easily, because such support systems as strategic lift, worldwide communications, and intelligence are global in scope and can be used to support combat forces in several regions concurrently. Nevertheless, it is accurate to say that the cost of developing and procuring this global infrastructure is based on the worldwide scope of U.S. commitments and is very expensive. For example, the Pentagon has spent roughly $6 billion annually on developing, procuring, and operating its airlift and sealift systems during the 1990s.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<b>THE FINANCIAL COST OF U.S. MILITARY LEADERSHIP: THE PERSIAN GULF WAR MODEL</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some critics of defense spending are quick to point out that the U.S. defense budget is three times larger than any other country's. They make this point to convince both Congress and the American people that the defense budget can be reduced safely from projected levels without jeopardizing U.S. security commitments. This assumes, however, that the U.S. needs to spend only as much as--or slightly more than--other states on defense, particularly regional bullies like Iraq or North Korea. This assumption is wrong. The U.S. needs to spend much more than three times the amount spent by rogue states in order to uphold its commitments to its allies in important regions. The history of the Persian Gulf War demonstrates why.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
History shows that from 1988-1990, the U.S. had to spend annually some seven times as much as Iraq to defeat Saddam Hussein in Kuwait (see <a href="bg1083c5.gif">Chart 5</a>).<sup>3</sup>  The reasons: 
<ul><p>
<li>The U.S. needs to meet commitments on a global basis, which requires greater spending on overseas bases, logistical support, airlift, and other military infrastructure. By contrast, rogue regimes need only threaten a U.S. commitment in one region, which is considerably cheaper.
<p>
<li>American military forces need to project power to regions thousands of miles from American shores, while the militaries of rogue regimes have only to operate in close proximity to their own territories. 
<p>
<li>The U.S. requires a high-technology force to defeat its enemies with limited casualties. By contrast, rogue regimes have fewer high-tech military systems and care little for the loss of human life on either side. 
<p>
<li>The U.S. chooses to retain a more expensive all-volunteer force as opposed to a conscript army of the sort retained by Iraq.
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If America wishes to remain a global power -- and it must if it wishes to protect its own freedom and security -- it must accept the burden of paying much more for its own defense than would its adversaries. U.S. forces are not "overstuffed."<sup>4</sup>  They are, if anything, already growing too weak to meet the challenging task of outgunning rogue states that have the luxury of spending less on defense than does the U.S. In this respect, rogue states are to the U.S. as an arsonist is to a fire insurance company: The arsonist, with his gasoline and matches, can spend much less than the insurance company, which either must focus on fire prevention or pay the cost of rebuilding a house burned down by the arsonist.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This cost, though high, must be borne by the U.S. It was the price of victory in the Gulf War, and it will be the price of victory in similar wars in the future. U.S. friends and allies, like Kuwait, understand that if America does not make the necessary investments to protect its regional interests, it will be unable to fulfill its commitments. This is why reductions in the defense budget threaten to undermine U.S. security commitments. As friends and allies like Kuwait question American commitment, they may begin to seek security elsewhere. These commitments are more than an academic question for U.S. friends and allies: As any Kuwaiti will attest, their very existence as sovereign states may hang in the balance.
<p>
<b>ANSWERING THE QUESTION ABOUT U.S. SECURITY COMMITMENTS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the end of the Cold War, there has been no debate about whether the U.S. should continue to uphold its existing security commitments to friends and allies around the world. As a result, defense budgets and military forces have been shrinking without consideration for the potential impact on the alliance structure. The Clinton Administration is largely responsible for this state of affairs. First, it failed to fund its own defense policy. Second, it altered internal accounts in the Pentagon budget to fund daily military operations at the direct expense of its ability to buy new weapons for the future. This has allowed the Administration to retain a conventional force that for the last several years is larger than the budget otherwise would allow. As pressure to buy new weapons builds, so does the pressure to reduce the size of the force to free up money for new weapons.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress, however, has exacerbated the problem. The budget resolution approved last year, covering fiscal years 1996 through 2002, added more funds for defense each year for fiscal years 1996 through 2000. Nevertheless, at the end of the seven-year period, in fiscal 2001 and 2002, Congress would spend less on defense than would the Clinton Administration. Further, even the $7 billion increase in defense expenditures Congress provided for the current fiscal year is not enough to fund the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review force structure. Putting the Pentagon on a path that funds both the readiness and    modernization needs of the military would require an increase of somewhat less than $20 billion.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One can only speculate about the sort of ugly reality the American people will have to face sometime during the next five years if Clinton Administration defense policies continue on their present course: for example, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the disintegration of NATO, an invasion of South Korea by the North, Russian hegemony over the "near abroad," or Iranian military control of the Persian Gulf. All that is needed is for the U.S. to be perceived as militarily weak and unable to uphold its security commitments in Asia, Europe, and the Persian Gulf. Clearly, the time has come for Congress to clarify this situation for the American people.
<p>
<b>CALL TO DEBATE</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The best way for Congress to educate the American people about the emerging gap between U.S. security commitments and forces is to debate the issue. The mere fact that Congress is debating the issue will serve to bring home to the American people that there is a serious problem. As of now, they cannot know because the Clinton Administration refuses to acknowledge that the problem exists. As the American people become aware of the emerging gap, the likelihood that the Clinton Administration will be forced to address it increases. Then, and only then, can the gap between forces and commitments be closed.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress also can propose a resolution to uphold U.S. security commitments by increasing projected defense budgets to fund the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review force. Even with the additional funding, however, Congress would be required to propose a riskier strategy than the one proposed in the Bottom-Up Review. The resolution should admit this by asserting that, at best, the Bottom-Up Review force is capable of handling one major regional conflict (similar to the Persian Gulf War) and one minor regional conflict (similar to the 1989 invasion of Panama) simultaneously, as opposed to two major regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously" (a sample draft resolution can be found in the appendix to this paper).<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Currently projected defense budgets have America on a forced march along the path to military weakness and withdrawal. The alarming thing is that the American people are not aware that the nation is headed in this direction. A congressional debate over the future of U.S. security commitments is needed to start the process of educating the American people about this potentially life-or-death issue. The debate should be on a resolution that puts Congress on record as saying that America does not go back on its commitments to its friends and allies. Further, this resolution would make it clear that Congress will continue to provide the military resources, above the Clinton Administration's requested levels, needed to back these commitments.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and its allies in Congress will deny that they wish to abrogate America's commitments to its friends and allies. But in this respect, their actions speak louder than their words. The American people need to know that a choice must be made and that the President and Congress so far have not made it. Hanging in the balance is whether America will or will not be a global power capable of defending its own interests and freedom, which requires it to meet its security commitments to its allies and friends around the world.

<h3>CLINTON'S BOSNIA VENTURE THREATENS WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO UPHOLD -- THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE</h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 267<br>
December 15, 1995<br>
<p>
(Updating Backgrounder No. 1012, "Don't Let Bosnia Destroy NATO," December 28, 1994.)
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
A year ago, The Heritage Foundation warned that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's credibility was being severely damaged by subordination of its Bosnian peace enforcement efforts to an impotent and ineffective United Nations (UNPROFOR) command structure. At the same time, Heritage warned that misguided attempts to salvage NATO's credibility by "Americanizing" the Balkan conflict could destroy the alliance, because it would impose a responsibility which NATO was not designed to handle.<sup>1</sup> <p>
Today, as a result of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/current/bosnia/bosagree.html">Dayton peace agreement</a>, the Bosnia war is being Americanized. Advance parties of U.S. and allied troops already are in Bosnia or on their way. Now that the formal peace agreement has been signed in Paris, the U.S. First Armored Division will begin moving from Germany into northeast Bosnia. In all, some 60,000 NATO troops, including upwards of 20,000 Americans and contingents from 11 non-NATO countries, will take part in the Bosnian Implementation Force (IFOR). This number does not include the even larger logistical "tail," as well as naval and air units, that will be dedicated to supporting U.S. elements on the ground. 
<p>
This massive deployment of American ground forces for a peacekeeping mission -- one in which there is no emergency, no threat to U.S. lives, and no immediate national security interest at stake -- is unprecedented. Nevertheless, it is going forward. On Decemer 13 the Senate offered qualified and grudging support for the troops and mission in Bosnia, while the House backed the troops but opposed the President's policy.
<P>
Deploying 20,000 U.S. troops to IFOR is highly risky and unnecessary. But the Clinton Administration painted the United States into a corner with ill-considered promises of ground troops and by making U.S. participation in the peacekeeping force a condition of the Dayton peace framework. Once these commitments were on the table, the Administration found it necessary to invoke the sanctity of U.S. commitments, America's credibility and prestige, and the continued strength of the Atlantic alliance in order to sell the deployment to Congress. For these reasons, Congress had no choice but to offer its support at least for U.S. troops in Bosnia.
<p>
The IFOR commitment, entered into hastily and without thoughtful analysis, is, in the words of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, an example of a vital national interest which has been "self-created."<sup>2</sup>  But this is the hand that has been dealt, and the U.S. must play it out as best it can. Though there are risks in going into Bosnia, the Clinton Administration's intellectual confusion and incompetent statecraft have set up a situation in which there also are penalties if America turns its back on NATO and the allies at this stage. The U.S. has to weigh the actual and certain damage of reneging on its promises against the potential and uncertain damage if the mission should fail at some future point. Presented with a wholly unnecessary <i>fait accompli</i>, the Congress now must support American troops while expressing strong reservations about the Bosnia mission, laying down markers for its success or failure, and establishing some clear guidelines for implementation of the peace plan.
<p>
The President once again has led the nation into a foreign policy <i>cul de sac</i> with no good choices. American and allied soldiers in IFOR may lose their lives, all in the name of "preserving NATO."  Since public opposition to the U.S. role in IFOR is both broad and deep, the Administration's Bosnian sales pitch may well result in loss of public support for the NATO alliance as IFOR casualties mount. 
<p>
As the U.S. wades deeper into this proverbial quagmire, it is time to look at past mistakes and future risks. The nation's leaders must make sure this mission does not turn into another Somalia episode, destroying the very things it is supposed to uphold -- U.S. leadership, credibility, prestige, the sanctity of U.S. commitments, and especially the health of the Western alliance.
<p>

<b>Correcting the Administration's Mistakes</b>
<p>
The Clinton Administration has made some serious mistakes in its policy on Bosnia. The President and Congress should correct these mistakes in the coming days and weeks.
<p>
<b>Mistake #1:  Linking the Implementation Force to NATO</b><br>
The President must stop making IFOR a test case for NATO, and the Administration must begin to anticipate what will happen to public support for NATO as a result of this policy linkage if the Bosnia mission results in the loss of U.S. soldiers and a premature withdrawal. Such an outcome would be far more destructive of NATO than a U.S. refusal to commit ground troops to IFOR at the outset. NATO is more important to the U.S. than IFOR, and American public support for NATO must transcend the ups and downs of this peace implementation mission.
<p>
<b>Mistake #2:  De Facto Changes in the North Atlantic Treaty</b><br>
Having experienced the failure of the UNPROFOR command arrangement, the Administration refused to deploy U.S. troops to Bosnia under the United Nations. This was a wise move. Only a tried and true military command structure, one in which the U.S. is the dominant military partner, is acceptable for U.S. troops in potential danger. Putting IFOR under NATO was the only practical choice.
<p>
However, in sending troops on a peace enforcement mission to Bosnia under NATO, the Administration has turned the North Atlantic Treaty into something other than a mutual defense treaty. Article 5 of the treaty explicitly makes NATO a defensive alliance:  An attack upon one is an attack upon all. It does not authorize out-of-area peacekeeping operations. 
<p>
The Administration must begin to address the impact of unilaterally stretching the fabric of the Atlantic alliance beyond what it will bear. If the North Atlantic Treaty is going to be converted into something other than a mutual defense treaty that leads to more Bosnia-like missions in the future, then the American people (as well as the other 15 member nations of NATO) have the right to approve. In America's case, approval should come through the advise-and-consent treaty prerogative of the U.S. Senate under the Constitution.
<p>
<b>Mistake #3: Confusion Over Ends and Means</b><br>
	NATO has never been an end in itself, but a means to achieve the collective defense of its members. As such, it is still immensely important and worth preserving. However, since the threat and the historical conditions which gave birth to NATO have changed dramatically, NATO cannot expect to remain the same and still be relevant to the security needs of Europe and the strategic interests of the United States. Those needs still exist, even if in different form, and must be articulated clearly by the President and his national security leadership. By invoking NATO to justify an unpopular IFOR mission, the Administration has confused this equation and made NATO the end in itself. That argument will not be sustainable if things in Bosnia go wrong. If the IFOR mission fails, it will be seen as a failure of NATO. Questions then will be raised about the efficacy and necessity of NATO. As a result, perhaps America's most important military alliance will have been put in jeopardy.
<p>
<b>Mistake #4: Neglecting the Selection of NATO's Secretary General</b><br>
The Administration either acquiesced in, or actively participated in, the short-sighted decision to pick Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana as NATO's new Secretary General. Solana, a leading Spanish Socialist, opposed Spain's entry into NATO and was active in trying to expel the U.S. from NATO air bases in Spain. While he may have experienced a "confirmation conversion," American supporters of NATO are entitled to be skeptical of the selection of a man with marginal qualifications and whose country is not part of NATO's integrated command structure, especially at what is perhaps the most critical moment in NATO's recent history. 
<p>
The Administration is willing to send 20,000 U.S. soldiers into potential combat "in order to preserve NATO," but it was not willing to insist on -- or even recruit, if necessary -- a highly qualified and credible Secretary General from a country which is part of the integrated military command. It is too late now to make another choice, but it is not too late for the United States to demand that the new Secretary General:
<p><ul>
<li> Respect the essential military nature of NATO as a defensive alliance. Efforts to get NATO involved in "nation building" and other civilian activities should be resisted, while attempts formally to change NATO's charter to deal with peacekeeping and other quasi-military missions should be discouraged;
<p>
<li> Assert NATO's primacy in the implementation of the Bosnia peace accord to insure that refugee matters and nation-building activity by the U.N. and the Organization for Security and Cooperations in Europe do not interfere with military operations under NATO;
<p>
<li> Defer to NATO's Supreme Military Commander in all matters related to IFOR military operations; and
<p>
<li> Support robust rules of engagement and aggressive force protection measures.
</ul><p>
<b>Mistake #5: Turning the U.S. Armed Services into a Constabulary Force</b><br>
The principal mission of the U.S. armed forces is to fight and win America's wars. This mission requires continuous, arduous, and dedicated training. In contrast, the Clinton Administration has demonstrated a peculiar propensity toward using U.S. military forces for peacekeeping, peace enforcement, humanitarian, and other non-traditional missions while neglecting to provide the resources and commitment needed to keep them in the best fighting trim. In effect, the Administration, led by a commander in chief notoriously inexperienced in foreign and defense policy, is in danger of turning America's combat-ready forces into a constabulary force and NATO into a regional policing organization. If NATO is to remain viable, its primary mission must remain self-defense and deterrence, not peacekeeping and peace enforcement.
<p>
One of the greatest concerns of U.S. Army commanders being deployed to Bosnia is the inevitable erosion of their units' combat skills, which demand constant and rigorous training to keep honed. The U.S. deployment to Bosnia requires the great majority of the ground combat strength of U.S. forces in Europe. Upon returning to their bases in Germany from Bosnia, these troops will need many months to retrain and regain the warfighting skills that will atrophy during the IFOR mission. This effectively puts the U.S. Army in Europe out of the warfighting business for at least two years. The problem was highlighted recently in a General Accounting Office report charting the deleterious and alarming effects of peace operations on combat readiness.<sup>3</sup>  After a year in Bosnia on peacekeeping duty, the U.S. First Armored Division, now arguably the best, most combat-ready heavy division in the world, will no longer be at a state of readiness to perform its warfighting mission should a crisis erupt in another part of the world.
 <p><b>"Inoculating" NATO Against Failure in Bosnia</b><p>
In addition to correcting these mistakes, there are several steps the Administration and Congress should take to inoculate NATO against the possible failure of IFOR. The ambiguities and contradictions inherent in the peace accord and the military plan have exposed the contrary and clashing ambitions of the allies. The Administration must end the rhetorical oversell, begin a serious assessment of these inherent deficiencies, and develop strategies to deal with them as they become evident on the ground. Above all, the U.S. should take the lead in assuring that the cracks now appearing in NATO's approach to IFOR will not widen as this poorly planned mission proceeds. The first priority is to ensure a political and military unity of effort among the NATO allies.
<P>
<b>Getting Political Unity Among the Allies.</b>
<p>
 America and Europe have fundamentally different policy approaches to the Bosnian problem that transcend the provisions of the peace accord initialed in Dayton. The first and most obvious disagreement is over goals, end-states, and commitment. America's European allies, having been on the ground in the former Yugoslavia for the better part of the four-year war, understand that a long-term commitment is needed to address this enigmatic and intractable conflict. In the face of extended European commitment to the long-term rehabilitation of war-torn Bosnian society, the Clinton Administration has proposed a plan that has U.S. troops redeploying within nine or ten months. It is obvious to the European allies that, for the U.S., the "exit strategy is the mission. That is, the mission is to show up and leave, not to stay until the goals are fully achieved."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
According to the timetable laid out in the Dayton peace accords, the period when U.S. troops will be ready to redeploy will be the most crucial and fragile period in the peace implementation plan. It is at this time that the critical issues of disarmament, refugee resettlement, elections, and the political formation of an elaborate central Bosnian government all will be coming to the fore. It is also at this time that the U.S. commitment will be waning.
<p>
The second policy disagreement concerns arming and training the Bosnian Muslims, a policy the European NATO partners have resisted vigorously throughout the conflict. If the expected scenario is played out, nine or ten months into this operation, American troops will be redeploying and European forces will be manning the buffer zone and assisting in nation-building while the U.S. is sponsoring the arming and training of the Bosnian army. The International Institute of Strategic Studies in London recently noted that this "will not only undermine the impartiality which IFOR is now insisting on, but it will certainly encourage, if that was ever needed, Croat and Serb forces to maintain their own arsenals."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
Clearly, such fundamental policy disagreements need to be addressed thoroughly before more soldiers set foot on the ground. Otherwise, much as disagreement over disarmament did in Somalia, the issue will work to split the alliance and bring down the mission. America and her allies have a peace accord and a peace implementation plan. They do not have full agreement on a final political settlement, intermediate and long-term objectives, criteria for success, and a road map to get there.
<p>
<b>Getting Military Unity Among the Allies.</b>
<p>
 NATO is one of the few military alliances with a consistent, reliable, and rehearsed common doctrine as well as standard operating procedures. However, this common doctrine is no assurance of a common approach to the military aspects of the peace implementation mission. It is a challenge in any multinational mission to ensure that a common tactical and operational approach is used by all forces. This challenge increases by leaps and bounds in a mission that has ill-defined goals, objectives, and end-states. As noted above, the Bosnia implementation plan is not well-defined enough to ensure a unified and common approach to operations.
<p>
In the U.N. operation in Somalia, the forces involved operated under standard rules of engagement and a common operational plan, and yet there were great differences in interpreting military actions in this peace-enforcement mission. In Somalia, the U.S. had its most significant differences with another NATO ally -- Italy -- and even demanded the United Nations fire the Italian military commander after he publicly criticized the American contingent's aggressive approach to operations. Common doctrine in a contentious mission by no means guarantees unity of effort. A disagreement over tactics and operations easily can lead to a splintering of the mission.
<p>
In Bosnia, the U.S., French, British, Russian, and 19 other military contingents (both NATO and non-NATO) also will interpret the mission and rules of engagement differently. America's European allies tend to operate with much greater restraint and patience as a result of their long experience with these types of missions. They eschew both the emphasis on disproportionate and overwhelming force by the U.S.<sup>6</sup>  and the wanton use of force by the Russians in conflicts such as Chechnya. In fact, a recent British military report emphasized that "American doctrine currently lacks the subtlety required for internal conflict and is in danger of being associated with an inexact and counter-productive use of force."<sup>7</sup>  The European allies are not nearly as impatient or intolerant of casualties as the U.S. and are willing to bear far greater restraints for longer periods of time in these types of missions.<p><b>NATO Expansion.</b><br> One of the most profound ways the Administration can inoculate NATO against failure in Bosnia is to embark upon a coherent and thoughtful program of NATO expansion. This will give the alliance new life and energy, and will reassert its role as a mutual security treaty by integrating the new democratic states of East and Central Europe.
<p>
NATO has been the foundation of European security for 45 years, possibly the most successful such alliance in history. The U.S. should support a renewed and enlarged NATO because it guarantees an American presence on the European continent and a "seat at the table" in the world's most vital, productive region. The United States has clear, abiding, and vital interests in Europe. Europe is the soil where America's deepest roots are found. America is bound to Europe by innumerable links of trade, finance, communications, and technology exchange; ties of history, culture, and shared values; and nearly five decades of mutual security arrangements. 
<p>
A free and stable Europe has always been essential to the United States. In the 20th century, the U.S. has intervened in two bloody world wars to prevent the domination of Europe by aggressive dictatorships. Moreover, America paid a high price for 45 years of Cold War to prevent the domination of Europe and the Eurasian landmass by communist imperialism. This involvement and stabilizing presence have made the U.S. in effect a European power. Americans cannot cut themselves off from Europe without doing harm to the U.S. as a world power, and as a people.
<p>
Europe cannot remain stable and prosperous, to the mutual benefit of the U.S. and the European allies, if its post-Cold War boundary is drawn along the borders of Germany and Austria. Such an artificial division would leave a power vacuum in East Central Europe and consign millions of people who share America's democratic values and aspirations to an uncertain fate. A new European security framework will not hold up unless it reflects the realities of the political upheaval that marked the end of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact. That new reality includes the re-orienting of former East Bloc states toward the West.
<p>
There are other reasons to enlarge NATO-- for example, to lessen internal tensions between members and facilitate the resolution of conflicts-- but the U.S. must not lose sight of the fact that NATO has been successful because it was a defensive alliance. Turning it into something else could weaken it fatally. At the very least, changing the nature of NATO, as the Administration is doing in Bosnia, requires debate in Congress. Unless America understands that NATO's underlying and abiding purpose remains to defend Europe, the burdens of the alliance over time will cause NATO to crumble.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
Because the Bosnian peace implementation plan is weak and ambiguous in many of its military provisions, there is a great possibility that several major policy imbroglios could develop between the U.S. and its NATO allies. As British strategist William Shawcross recently noted in <i>The Times</i> of London, "A real danger is that, although the Dayton agreement provides a chance to end the war, its complexities, its contradictions and the different if not conflicting ambitions of the Allies mean that it, too, may be seen to fail. That would be an even more serious failure than that of the UN. It would be the defeat of NATO, and of the Western Alliance."<sup>8</sup> <p><b>What Congress Should Do </b><p>Deep opposition to the IFOR deployment exists in both political parties and in both houses of Congress. But at this stage, the 104th Congress has been unwilling to challenge the President's constitutional prerogatives as commander in chief, either by a statutory prohibition of U.S. participation in IFOR or by cutting off funds, both of which are within Congress's power. Once American forces are deployed on missions where hostile action is possible, Congress usually is reluctant to endanger them or undermine their success by making the mission the object of a domestic political struggle. The Administration, counting on this traditional support for the troops, was confident its Bosnia <i>fait accompli</i> would survive congressional action.
<p>
On December 13, the Senate voted 69-30 in favor of the Dole-McCain resolution, which supports the men and women in uniform but "does not endorse the President's decision ...[or] the agreement reached in Dayton," according to Majority Leader Dole. The House, which had voted to cut off funds for the Bosnia mission, was even more forceful, voting 287-141 to condemn the mission while expressing support for the troops being deployed. This tepid endorsement provides political distance for Members of Congress should the President's Bosnian intervention result in catastrophic failure. 
<p>
But expressing support for the troops while criticizing the Dayton plan and IFOR's mission does not end Congress's responsibility. Congress simply cannot wash its hands of the issue and cede all responsibility to a President who has shown such ineptness in foreign and defense policy. If Members believe the IFOR mission is dangerously flawed, they have a responsibility to continue their efforts to mitigate the dangers. This would demonstrate actual and not just rhetorical support for the troops facing possible death or injury in Bosnia.
<p>
How should Congress respond to the Administration's <i>fait accompli</i>?  First, Congress should continue to exercise its oversight responsibility by reviewing the mistakes that led to the "boxing in" of the United States so that no choice was left but to proceed with such a risky and unnecessary venture. Second, it should assess the ambiguities and deficiencies in the Bosnia peace plan that could jeopardize success -- and thus harm NATO and U.S. credibility.<sup>9</sup>  Third, it should consider future legislation building on the momentum and principles established in the December 13 House and Senate votes and designed to achieve the following: <p><ul><li> Lay down additional markers by which success or failure can be measured. This would help prevent "mission creep" and provide further basis for an exit strategy.

<li> Establish some basic guidelines for implementing the agreement. This could include such do's and don'ts as:  a) avoid trying coercively to disarm unthreatening factions; b) refuse to get involved in nation-building or to police civilian activities; c) avoid trying to guarantee either the return of refugees or certain outcomes in elections; d) resist the temptation to launch military operations in search of alleged war criminals; and e) use overwhelming force when challenged.

<li> Express strong support for NATO and NATO expansion. The President has implied that opposition to the Dayton plan is tantamount to weakening the credibility of America's commitment to NATO. Congress should make it clear that this is not true. In no way should the reservations of Congress be interpreted as doubting the validity or credibility of NATO. A vote of confidence in NATO and for expanding the alliance not only would help to deflect the President's unfair and unwise depiction of doubters as isolationists or opponents of NATO, but also would help to inoculate NATO against the fallout of the possible failure in Bosnia that so many in Congress fully expect.
</ul><p>
Opposing IFOR is not equivalent to isolationism or opposition to NATO. In fact, it may turn out to be the Clinton Administration's misguided adventurism that destroys NATO. The President has embarked upon a hazardous course for good or ill; he alone is now responsible to the American people for what happens. But he needs to be reminded, even as Americans defer to his role as commander in chief, that U.S. credibility and prestige are too valuable to be squandered or debased by improper use.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The statement that "If you like laws and sausages, you should never watch either one being made" is attributed to Prince Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of Germany during the late 19th century. Were he alive today, he might want to add "government management" to that list. It also is not a pretty sight, and no one seems much interested in cleaning up the mess.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fact is that, notwithstanding all sorts of promises to the contrary by elected officials of both parties, in Congress and in the White House, egregious instances of costly waste continue throughout the government and all too often survive the budget ax while important spending plans are scrapped. Consider the following recent examples drawn from the government's own studies and reports:
<p>
<b>Beach Blanket Boondoggle</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The invitation to the 1995 convention of the National Tenant Organization (NTO) at the San Juan, Puerto Rico, Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort reads like any vacation brochure: "We promise you a vacation that will be unforgettable!!  Casino's for Dads. Beaches, Swimming, Snorkeling, Dancing, & Touring etc... for youths. Exotic Shopping, Beauty Salon for complete pampering for Moms. Appetizing, Savory, Delicious foods for the Family Meals."
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only problem is that this boondoggle occurred in the guise of a training session for 260 public housing tenants, public housing officials, and employees of the <a href="http://www.hud.gov">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> that was both sponsored and funded by HUD. It cost the U.S. taxpayer an estimated $325,000, according to HUD's own Inspector General in a February 29, 1996, report to Congress.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although HUD officials denied any agency involvement when first questioned by Congress, the department's independent Inspector General subsequently concluded that "HUD officials played a key role in planning and conducting NTO's 1995 National Convention in Puerto Rico."<sup>2</sup>  And although conference sponsors contend the event was educational in nature, the Inspector General found otherwise, concluding that "The video recordings of actual convention events show the poor organization and lack of programmatic substance at the convention."  The official watchdog further commented that "The videos of convention events also show the political nature of the convention," noting that the government employee who was translating from English to Spanish withdrew in the middle of a session because he believed that it was inappropriate for a federal employee to be involved in such a partisan event. It seems that his superiors did not show the same good judgment.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Kevin E. Marchman, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, (202) 708-0950.

<p>
<b>Crash Test Dummies</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the ValuJet crash focused the public's attention on the <a href="http://www.dot.gov">Department of Transportation</a>'s questionable enforcement of air safety standards, a recent report by DOT's Inspector General found similar failures in the Federal Transit Administration's Bus Testing Program. This program is operated for DOT and FTA by university faculty and graduate students at two Pennsylvania test facilities. The IG's report concluded that "FTA procedures were not adequate to ensure new bus models were tested as required; deficiencies existed in tests for structural integrity, performance and fuel economy."<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Specifically, as noted in the report, "at least ten new bus models, involving $44.5 million in federal funds, were operating without having been tested."  The report also suggested that the government might be able to recover $350,000 due to questionable personnel costs. These costs included salaries paid to eight graduate students who were not working on the project, payments to the principal investigator after he was replaced, and salary paid to a facilities manager after he was reassigned to other duties. This report has been available to the DOT and to Congress for more than two years. But according to the Inspector General, DOT has not yet resolved the allegations raised in the report; nor has it recovered the money.

<P>
<b>Dialing With Your Dollars</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Each year the <a href="http://www.usda.gov">Department of Agriculture</a> spends more than $50 million to provide telephone service for its 105,000 employees, but a costly portion of that spending represents employee phone abuse that Department officials ignored despite earlier warnings from the U.S. General Accounting Office.<sup>4</sup>  The GAO also discovered that the USDA continued to pay for telephone service for field offices that had been closed for more than a year.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How bad is the abuse?  During a four month period examined by the GAO, about half of all collect calls received by USDA employees, amounting to more than 600 calls costing $2,600, were from inmates at 18 jails or prisons. Many of these calls were rerouted illegally by USDA employees to other USDA long-distance lines.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to the GAO, the USDA had been aware of the inmate abuse since 1994 but did nothing to stop it. The same GAO review found that numerous calls were being made from Agriculture Department phones to adult chat lines that offer sexually explicit entertainment, and that a number of these involved expensive international calls, many to the Dominican Republic. The GAO was unable to determine to what extent these sex-related calls were made by rerouted, collect-calling inmates.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Dan Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture, (202) 720-3631.
<p>
<b>You Can Dance If You Want to, You Can Leave Your Friends Behind.... </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The notion that the government should fund self-sustaining, indigenous culture and art like the North Dallas Square Dance Club or the Out of Town Blues Band at Washington's New Vegas Lounge probably would strike most Americans as both silly and wasteful. Yet this is exactly what the National Endowment for the Arts has been doing -- but only if the artistic activity is indigenous to foreign countries -- at a cost to the American taxpayer of hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in the dance category alone.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Should taxpayers subsidize Mexican folk dancing?  The NEA thinks so. It gave $40,000 in 1994 (the most recent year for which spending details are available) to Floricanto Dance Theater, Academia de Danza y Folklore Mexicano, Raices de Mexico, and Los Lupenos de San Jose. It seems that even Japanese folk dancing needs taxpayer help. The NEA gave $10,000 to the Tokunagu Dance Ko. and the Jo Ha Kyu Performance Group.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The list goes on and on, including the New York Chinese Cultural Center, Dancing and Drums of Africa, and $20,000 to the Capoeira Foundation (Brazilian dance). Traditional Philippine dance was supported through the Samahan Philippine Dance Company and Kulintang Arts Inc., while groups pursuing dance cultures of undetermined ethnicity such as the Najwa Dance Corps, Sharir Dance Company, and Zivili Kolo Ensemble reflect the dozens of dance clubs that received taxpayer support.
<p>
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Jane Alexander, Chairman, National Endowment for the Arts, (202) 682-5414.

<b>A Knockout Punch to the Taxpayer</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Faced with imminent fiscal collapse, the District of Columbia government has cut back on many vital social services and has been forced to surrender much of its executive authority to an independent control board as a pre-condition for any taxpayer bailout, now averaging $3,898 for each and every District resident. But these reforms have not extended to D.C.'s Boxing and Wrestling Commission -- a money loser thanks to mismanagement and a limited number of poorly attended professional fights. Sharing responsibility for D.C.'s few professional fights with the D.C. Sports Commission, the Boxing Commission normally is supposed to be funded by an excise tax on gate receipts and revenues from pay-per-view boxing matches shown over local cable television. But the District of Columbia Auditor found that the Commission generally fails to collect the required taxes and operates at a loss: more than $26,000 over the past two years.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Commission has failed to collect the necessary taxes in every year between 1991 and 1995. Much of the shortfall reflects both the Commission's inability to collect taxes owed by the local cable TV monopoly and its mismanagement of live fights. This occurs despite the fact that the financially pressed District government spends more than $2 million per year on the Office of Cable Television, whose duties include monitoring the company's compliance with the terms and conditions of its franchise agreement. Last year, the unauthorized distribution of complimentary tickets to the "Million Man March Fights" by one of the Commission's officials led the promoter of the event to withhold his tax payment. Had the District collected the boxing fees it was owed and operated the Commission on a break-even basis, it would have had enough money to repair dozens of its growing inventory of disabled police cars.

Americans are increasingly aware of well-documented failings within the <a href="http://www.faa.gov">Federal Aviation Administration</a>-operated air traffic control system, which is responsible for safely guiding airplanes in flight, as well as through takeoffs and landings.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

America's government-operated air traffic control system lurches from one costly equipment failure to another, most recently with a new sophisticated radar system designed to detect dangerous wind conditions. Expected to cost $373 million when installed at 47 airports, the new system has suffered frequent shutdowns and failures at the 16 airports where it already is in place. At Washington's National Airport, for example, the new system has failed nearly once a week since it was installed in January 1996, and its failure to detect unsafe wind conditions contributed to a potentially dangerous situation where strong winds caused a plane's wing to hit a runway light on takeoff.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Persistent failure of costly equipment is nothing new with the FAA. Other recent occurrences include a power surge blamed on a squirrel, which took down the Cleveland airport's radar for a week; a new system in Pasco, Washington, that could track cars in driveways but sometimes missed planes; Tampa controllers who complained of "black holes" on their screens, with planes disappearing for two or three miles; and lost power in the New York City area system that grounded 200 planes while another 37 were in the air -- one pilot used on-board telephones to contact the New York ground controllers. Also occurring over the past year were multiple radar failures in Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, Florida; Baltimore, Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Washington, D.C.; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Gardena, California; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Between May 1993 and June 1995, the Long Island control facility that guides planes over the North Atlantic suffered 16 significant outages; the nearby New York center that handles planes flying close to the city has experienced 52 significant computer failures since 1993.

</td></tr></table>


<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On September 26, 1996, the <a href="http://www.census.gov/">U.S. Bureau of the Census</a> announced that real median family income increased in 1995 by 1.8 percent.<sup>1</sup>  Unfortunately, many American families will find these apparent gains in income elusive. Since 1991, the growth in family income has stagnated, falling far below increases recorded during any four-year period of economic growth since 1960. In traditional married families with only the husband working, incomes have continued to decline. Only increases in the labor force participation of women, income from other sources, and the number of full-time workers also working at a second job have helped to keep the level of family income from falling across the board.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not since World War II has the American economy come out of a recession, grown for four consecutive years, and failed to produce a significant increase in family income. No matter how one breaks down the numbers -- by region, age, marriage, or education -- the typical American family has seen real income stagnate or decline compared with the economic recoveries of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s (see <a href="fyi121c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).<sup>2</sup>  This dismal economic performance, despite lower unemployment, explains why American workers continue to believe they are working harder and harder yet failing to get ahead.
<p>
<b>Family Income Grows Slowly While Real Earnings Continue to Fall</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By most measures -- family income, employment, wages, or economic growth -- the 1991-1995 economic recovery has been by far the slowest since the end of World War II.<sup>3</sup>  After reaching a peak of $42,049 in 1989, real median family income declined by 7.2 percent from 1989 to 1993. The initial decline can be attributed to the 1990-1991 recession, but family income continued to fall as the recovery got underway in 1992 and 1993. Despite increases in 1994 and 1995, real median family income is just 1.0 percent more than it was in 1991, and remains 3.4 percent below 1989.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since 1993, family income has grown while real median weekly earnings for full-time workers have declined (see <a href="fyi121c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). This apparent anomaly arises because the weekly earnings of full-time workers are only one part of family income. Other sources of family income include second jobs and the earnings of spouses and children. Family income also includes interest income, dividends, and Social Security, all of which have been growing faster than wage and salary income since 1993.<sup>4</sup>  Only the increasing participation of women in the labor force and income from other sources have kept family incomes from falling overall.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The decline in real median weekly earnings since 1993 also raises a serious question about President Clinton's claim that most of the new jobs created since 1992 are high-paying jobs. If it is true that most of the recent employment growth has been in jobs paying above median wages, real median weekly earnings should be increasing. The data show, however, that real median weekly earnings for both men and women have declined from 1991 to 1995, suggesting that most of the job growth since 1991 has been in lower paying (below the median) jobs.

<p>
<b>Families Enjoying Growth in Real Income Vary Considerably</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1991, family income has increased for some types of families while declining significantly for others, such as traditional married families with only the husband working. Baby-boomers who saw their family income rise 5.3 to 11.1 percent during the 1980s recovery are wondering why, after four years of economic growth, their family incomes actually have declined.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Growth in family income since 1991 also has varied considerably by region and by education. While family incomes rose 5.7 percent in the Midwest, they declined by 2.5 percent in the Northeast. Only families with either a doctoral degree or less than a 9th grade education have seen their family incomes rise;<sup>7</sup> everyone else's incomes have declined.
<p>
<b>Other Measures of Income Also Are Growing Slowly</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Family income is not the only measure of income that is growing either slowly or not at all. For example, from 1991 to 1995:
<p><ul>
<li> The income for all households grew in 1995 for the first time in six years, but only in the Midwest.<sup>8</sup>  In all other regions, household income continued to stagnate. Since 1991, real median household income has increased just 1.1 percent, and the income of single men and women living alone has not increased at all.
<p>
<li> Real median weekly earnings for women working full-time declined by 1.7 percent.<sup>9</sup>  For men working full-time, the decline was even worse:  3.3 percent. In addition, 4.4 million Americans are working two jobs (one full-time) just to make ends meet.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li> Real average annual pay has increased only 1.2 percent to $18,271.<sup>11</sup>  This is an increase of just 0.2 percent per year compared to a 1.0 percent increase per year from 1982 to 1986.<p>
<li> Real disposable income per person increased at less than half the pace of the economic expansions in the 1960s and 1980s, and 1 percent less than that of the 1974-1978 period.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<li> Real hourly compensation increased at less than half the pace of the economic expansions in the 1970s and 1980s, and only one-fifth the rate of increase in the 1960-1964 period.<sup>13</sup>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although the most recent data on family income seem encouraging, a more careful examination shows that the American economy continues to perform well below its potential, and many families are being left behind. For the first time in 50 years, the American economy has failed to raise family incomes significantly during four consecutive years of economic growth after a recession. Growth has been weak because of high taxes and burdensome regulations that limit productivity gains and lower the real earnings of American workers.<sup>14</sup>  Policies that focus on addressing these problems -- and especially on reducing the tax burden on Americans -- will unleash America's growth potential and allow all families, not just a select few, to enjoy higher incomes and realize their American dream.

<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although union members split their vote roughly 60-40 between the two major political parties in 1994, this year the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a> has launched an overwhelmingly partisan $35 million "voter education project," funded mainly with mandatory union dues, to defeat conservative members of the 104th Congress. What most union members may not realize is that they have every right to demand a refund of the portion of their dues used to back political candidates or lobby for causes with which they may disagree. Depending on the individual union and the accounting rules applied, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 a year per union member. This alone argues for a better system both to account for and to inform union members about the use of mandatory dues payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3580:">Worker Right to Know Act</a> (H.R. 3580), recently introduced by Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL), would require labor unions to get permission from their members before using mandatory dues for politicking and other activities unrelated to collective bargaining. Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~gregg/">Judd Gregg</a> (R-NH) has introduced <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3580:">a similar measure</a> (S. 1845) in the Senate. The House version of this legislation has been incorporated into the campaign finance legislation currently scheduled for House floor debate.

<p>
<b>BACKGROUND</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The National Labor Relations Act, the basic federal law governing relations between labor unions and employers, allows a union and an employer to enter into a union security agreement that requires workers, as a condition of their employment, to pay union membership dues (or an equivalent agency fee for nonmembers). Although section 14(b) of the NLRA (popularly known as the Taft-Hartley Act) allows states to enact "Right to Work" laws that prohibit such union security agreements, only 21 states have done so. In the other 29 states and the District of Columbia, a worker can be fired for refusing to pay union dues, even if such dues are used for purposes abhorrent to his or her religious, moral, or political beliefs.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <I>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</I> that workers who so choose are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities, contract administration, and grievance processes. Writing for the majority, Justice William Brennan noted that "the National Labor Relations Act... authorizes the exaction of only those fees and dues necessary to 'performing the duties of an exclusive representative of the employees in dealing with the employer on labor-management issues.'"<sup>2</sup>  Unfortunately, this decision remains largely unenforced.
<p>



<b>President Bush's Executive Order</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In October 1992, President George Bush issued an executive order requiring federal contractors to notify workers of their Beck rights by posting notices of these rights at worksites.<sup></sup>  One of the Clinton Administration's first actions was to rescind this order.<sup>4</sup>  Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who frequently proclaims the Clinton Administration's concern for workers' rights, told the AFL-CIO recently that "collective bargaining is not a privilege, it is a right."<sup>5</sup>  Yet the Administration has cooperated with union officials to keep workers in the dark on their Beck rights. To Reich, the Bush executive order's requirement that workers be informed of their rights is a "burden without a benefit."<sup>6</sup>

<p>
<b>National Labor Relations Board</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to enforce the NLRA, has failed to step in to break the conspiracy of silence on this issue. Earlier this year, in the first case concerning Beck rights heard by the Board since the Supreme Court's decision eight years ago, the NLRB found that a brief notice of Beck rights in a union's annual publication was sufficient to satisfy a worker's right to know. In a dissenting opinion, however, one NLRB member declared that this single notice did not "represent a good-faith effort" to inform non-member employees of their Beck rights.<sup>7</sup>
<p>

<b>PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING LAW</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Despite the <I>Beck</I> decision, rank-and-file union members remain largely unaware of just what their rights are. In an April 1996 survey of 1,000 union members, 78 percent did not know they had a right to obtain a refund for the portion of their mandatory dues spent on political activities. The survey further revealed that once union members realized what their Beck rights were, 56 percent would be likely to request a refund.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Even for workers who are aware of their rights, trying to exercise them can be frustrating. Currently, a union can require workers to resign from the union in order to exercise their Beck rights.<sup>9</sup>  Thus, workers who want to stop contributing to union "voter education" efforts can be left without a say in such important decisions as whether to go out on strike because their unions have forced them to resign.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Moreover, unions often serve as judge in their own case by making their own estimates of the amount of dues which should be refunded to Beck claimants. Exactly what constitutes non-collective bargaining activities is a question subject to significant disagreement. Marshall J. Breger, former Solicitor of the Department of Labor, states that as much as 80 percent of union dues is used for non-collective bargaining activities, while union attorneys claim the same 80 percent figure as the amount used for collective bargaining-related expenses.<sup>10</sup>  In a recent case, the National Education Association (NEA) and a state and local affiliate were able to prove that only 10 percent of their general treasury funds were chargeable to bargaining activities.<sup>11</sup>  Workers have a right to know where their hard-earned money is going. In 1993-1994, for instance, rank and file teacher union members in Modesto, California, paid $640 in combined local, state, and national union dues.<sup>12</sup>
<p>



<b>THE WORKER RIGHT TO KNOW ACT</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In spite of foot-dragging by labor leaders, the NLRB, and President Clinton, Congress can step in to see that hard-working Americans are made aware of their Beck rights. The Worker Right to Know Act (H.R. 3580, S. 1845) would require that a union obtain a signed agreement from an employee before using dues for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities. The agreement would offer a clear statement detailing the percentage of dues used for traditional collective bargaining and the percentage used for non-collective bargaining activities such as "voter education."<sup>13</sup>  An independent auditor would determine the percentage breakdown between mandatory and voluntary activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Worker Right to Know Act also would make it clear that if individual workers chose not to give a portion of their dues to the political agendas of labor leaders, they still would retain the right to participate fully in the activities of their unions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The House version differs from the Senate version in that it would amend the NLRA and the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA), while the Senate version would amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unions argue that this legislation is unnecessary because only a small percentage of workers have chosen to exercise their Beck rights, but that is no excuse for obstructing those who do seek to exercise their rights. Moreover, union leaders fail to mention that few union dues payers have been informed of their rights. Clearly, if knowledge of Beck rights was more widespread, more workers would seek to obtain refunds.
<p>

<b>HOW MUCH IS AT STAKE?</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Determining the overall size and composition of union budgets is difficult. Information on union membership and finances provided in annual LM-2 union disclosure forms filed with the U.S. Department of Labor is often vague and incomplete. Economist James T. Bennett of George Mason University, who has done extensive work in this area, notes that the Department of Labor neither sets guidelines for the information it requests nor performs comprehensive audits in order to verify the accuracy of the information submitted.<sup>15</sup>  Therefore, unions are fully aware that incomplete or inaccurate information will not be scrutinized. For example, the United Auto Workers (UAW) lists "not available" under rates for union dues and initiation fees on all forms currently on file at the Department of Labor (forms for 1990-1995).<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

What can be discerned, however, is that rank-and-file union members in many cases are shouldering increasingly heavy burdens as membership declines. From 1991-1995, for example, among several of the major international unions that make up the AFL-CIO, total receipts taken in actually increased while membership continued to drop.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Trends in local union revenue likewise indicate the burden rank-and-file members are being forced to bear. A random sample of locals, when combined with the internationals, shows that receipts per member range from a low of $709.36 to a high of $2,019.35 per year.<sup>17</sup>  Given the vagaries of union practices and accounting procedures, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 annually per union member.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Labor unions will claim that the Worker Right to Know Act is merely election year harassment, but those who experience the real harassment and frustration are the workers who try to exercise their right to refuse to fund political causes with which they disagree. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is time to make workers aware of their rights under applicable Supreme Court decisions and to make it possible for them to exercise these rights freely. Labor unions, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Clinton Administration have kept workers uninformed of their rights. The Worker Right to Know Act would remedy this problem by giving union members the power to choose for themselves whether to give their money to political causes and by making it indisputably clear that workers can continue to participate fully in the activities of their unions even if they choose not to support the AFL-CIO's partisan political agenda.

Russia's Rising Political Star - Heritage</title>

<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	General Alexander Ivanovich Lebed has emerged at the front of Russia's tumultuous political stage. According to the polls, he is poised to beat any other politician in the presidential elections scheduled for the summer of 1996. He is the most popular leader in Russia, ahead of President Boris Yeltsin. Yet few in the West know who he is or what he represents.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lieutenant General Lebed retired from command of the Special 14th Army in June 1995. This Russian army still occupies the Trans-Dniester region in Moldova. Lebed today is Vice Chairman of the Congress of Russian Communities, a nationalist party headed by Soviet-era military-industrial stalwart Yurii Skokov and guided by the famous writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. If Skokov and Lebed succeed in the Russian parliamentary elections of December 1995, their likely goals will be to restore the Russian Empire and dismantle democratic and market reforms.<sup>1</sup> A Lebed presidency might well plunge Russia into wars with her neighbors and confrontation with the United States.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lebed has said that enlarging NATO to include some countries of Central Europe would be enough to start World War III. He is deeply suspicious of the West, particularly the United States. Lacking economic education or knowledge, he would tend to push not only for ever-increasing military budgets, but also for speedy and forced integration of the Newly Independent States of the "near abroad" into a Greater Russia. As the quintessential Soviet military man, he would see only military strength and territorial aggrandizement as the true measures of Russia's status as a great power.
<p>

<b>WHO ARE YOU, GENERAL LEBED?</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lebed retired this year as a 44-year-old general of the paratroop and special assault forces. Russia's current Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, was Lebed's long-time boss and mentor. In 1981-1982 they fought together in Afghanistan, where Grachev earned the highest Soviet military decoration, Hero of the Soviet Union.<sup>2</sup> As commander of the elite Tula paratroop division, Lebed participated in suppressing ethnic unrest during the closing days of the Soviet empire in the late 1980s. In Azerbaijan in 1988, he cracked down on riots in the capital, Baku, and commanded the   (special operations) troops sent in to quell anti-Armenian pogroms in Sumgait. He then was dispatched to put down demonstrations in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in the spring of 1989. Over twenty people were killed and dozens wounded when his   troops used sapper shovels and chemical weapons to quash the unrest.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the winter of 1990, Lebed was ordered to impose martial law in Baku as communist rule in Azerbaijan was collapsing. Again, he proved himself a ruthless commander. Using armored personnel carriers, his troops shot, stabbed to death, and crushed hundreds of Azerbaijanis.<sup>3</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In 1989-1991, younger officers of the rank of colonel and general, many of them Afghan war veterans like Lebed and Grachev, threw in with Boris Yeltsin when he made his bid for power against Mikhail Gorbachev. Most senior marshals in the General Staff supported the hard-line communist forces who staged the 1991 coup aimed at deposing Gorbachev. Today there is a public debate in Russia between Lebed and Grachev about the role each played in the momentous events of August 1991. Lebed says that as commander of the Tula Guard division, he was ordered by Grachev, then commander of the paratroop forces, to take up a position near the Russian White House. According to Lebed, he informed Yeltsin that his troops had arrived to prevent bloodshed and then reported to Grachev that he intended to protect the seat of the Russian president. While Grachev insists he supported Yeltsin all along, Lebed claims that Grachev waffled between the putschists and the president until the last minute.<sup>4</sup> In addition, Lebed reportedly got into a personal fight with then-Vice President Rutskoi.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lebed assumed command of the 14th Army in June 1992, when ethnic Moldovans and Russians from the Trans-Dniester were at each other's throats. Three thousand people had been killed and tens of thousands wounded. Lebed stopped the war by decimating the nascent Moldovan armed forces. His nomination as commanding officer of the 14th Army put him in charge of one of the largest former Soviet arsenals, which could be used in the event of an attempt to revive the Soviet Union. Some Russian generals have explored the idea of selling arms from this depot to groups in the Balkans and the Middle East.<sup>5</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	At Kolbasna, a town near the Ukrainian border, Russian troops are still guarding the central military depot of the southwestern flank of the former Warsaw Pact. Without this protection, hundreds of tanks and cannon, millions of rounds of ammunition, and 400,000 tons of explosives could fall prey to Russian mercenaries, Serbs, Chechens, or anybody with enough cash to pay for them. Before retiring his command, Lebed suggested on several occasions that his removal from Moldova would allow "corrupt" Russian generals to sell off the gigantic 14th Army arsenal.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In 1994 Grachev began pushing for reduction of the Russian forces in the Trans-Dniester region. He called for bringing the 14th Army and its arsenal back to Russia proper and demanded both the removal of the Army commander and a dramatic reduction in the 14th Army's manpower. In July 1994, Grachev ordered Lebed to report to Moscow, where Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin offered him the post of Defense Minister of Tajikistan, a Central Asian state in the throes of civil war. Lebed declined, asking:  "Why should a Russian general help one group of Tajiks kill another group of Tajiks?"  Yeltsin finally intervened,<sup>6</sup> and Grachev reversed his decision,<sup>7</sup> but Lebed had to fight repeated attempts by Grachev to remove him from command of the 14th Army during the following months. Lebed refused to withdraw the 14th Army and continued to sit on the largest arsenal of weapons in southeastern Europe until his resignation in June 1995.
<p>

<b>GENERAL LEBED'S VIEWS</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	<b>On the end of the Russian Empire.</b> Lebed has been known to bemoan the collapse of the Soviet Union, to brag about his aggressive use of military force, and to defend Russian control of the Trans-Dniestrian enclave. As commander of the 14th Army, he threatened to take the Rumanian capital of Bucharest in seven hours. He has alleged that "The West is attempting to turn Russia into a cheap supplier of raw materials, a reservoir of free labor, and a huge hazardous waste dump for the industrial world."<sup>8</sup>  Because "Everybody is wiping their feet on Russia... Russia has to show her teeth."<sup>9</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	At the same time, looking back at the collapse of the USSR, the general appears now to have reconsidered the use of force:  "I know for sure that constitutional order cannot be restored by using air force, tanks and artillery. We used military power in Tbilisi, Baku, Vilnius. Where are they today -- Georgia, Azerbaijan, Lithuania?  Everything we tried to keep by force was lost. Now everything is being done in order to lose Chechnya."<sup>10</sup>  Whether this really signals a kinder, gentler approach, however, is unknown.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>On Moldova.</b> Lebed claimed there were three reasons why the 14th Army should stay in Moldova:  (1) if the Army was moved, the ethnic conflict would start again; (2) both the Trans-Dniester Russians and Moldovans wanted the Russian Army to stay; and (3) moving the army with its weaponry would be dangerous. In the event of withdrawal, he warned, the arms would be seized by the Trans-Dniestrian Russians, who would sell them or use them to fight Moldovans.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But Lebed did not enunciate the fourth -- and possibly the most weighty -- reason:  According to a leading Russian military commentator, for Russia to keep the huge arsenal in Moldova makes sense only if the former Soviet Union is put back together again. To do this would require a large army close to the Balkans and in Ukraine's rear, hundreds of miles away from the Russian border.<sup>11 </sup> Looking at the USSR's pre-1992 borders, it would make perfect sense for Lebed, a Russian "great power patriot," to keep the huge arsenal in Moldova indefinitely, until such time as the Soviet Union could be resurrected.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>On Democracy.</b> Lebed's democratic credentials are shaky at best. He once confessed that "To conduct diplomatic negotiations with some parliament to receive power and to maneuver is not my style."<sup>12</sup>  After he was forced to resign, he lost the aura of the persecuted general speaking for the disgruntled Russian army. Moreover, he is seen by some in the career military as having pushed the army toward a confrontation with the defense minister and the president that eroded the military's neutrality and its position "outside of politics."  Lebed is a general who used his military command to boost his political career.<sup>13</sup> By appealing to the media and civilian paramilitary forces, such as the Cossacks, Lebed played by a new set of rules that has been rejected by many officers.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>On Lenin.</b> Lebed is trying to define himself as a Russian patriot who appeals to both communists and nationalists. In media interviews published in 1993-1995, he attacked Russia's current leadership, charging that "Yeltsin is nothing but the first (communist party) secretary of Sverdlovsk, infamous for the destruction of the building where the last Russian tsar and his family were incarcerated before their execution."<sup>14</sup>  He also once publicly said he was reading the memoirs of White Russian generals Anton Denikin and Peter Krasnov from the Civil War era (1918-1921), a clear nod in the direction of the nationalist right wing. However, in the same interview Lebed defended keeping a large bust of Lenin in his headquarters and declared himself an atheist. "They threw the old fetishes to the junkyard, but did not give us new ones," he complained; "therefore Lenin stays."<sup>15</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The founder of the Soviet state indeed appears to have a special place in Lebed's heart:  "Lenin was the only man in our history who combined theory and practice in Russian politics."<sup>16</sup>  This despite numerous revelations in the Russian media about Lenin's personal involvement in hostage executions and the mass murder of Russian peasants, military officers, clergy, and intellectuals during and after the Civil War.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Leaders whom Lebed perceives as tough include Stalin, Charles De Gaulle, and Augusto Pinochet.<sup>17</sup> Lebed himself is often called a possible "Russian Pinochet" by the Moscow media, even though he adheres neither to the Chilean general's free-market policy nor to his anti-communism.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>On Crime.</b> After crushing the Moldovan attempt to take over the Trans-Dniester Republic, Lebed, who had become extremely popular locally, was elected to the Trans-Dniester Supreme Soviet (legislature). Soon he learned of the massive corruption and embezzlement for which the Trans-Dniester leadership is famous. He resigned from the local parliament, stating loudly that he would "not travel along with thieves," and called upon the state to "make everybody feel its gentle embrace."<sup>18</sup>  The army and Russian society at large took notice. Many interpreted this statement as aimed at the Yeltsin administration and Grachev's Defense Ministry, both widely regarded as corrupt.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Playing the anti-crime card in today's Russia was a winning move, especially when one military inspection after another failed to find anything wrong with the 14th Army. On the contrary, Lebed boosted morale, beefed up military drilling, created a special "Russian Soldier of the Future" program based on the Green Beret training routine, and almost eliminated the hazing and suicides which plague the rest of the Russian military.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In a country where alcoholism is the leading cause of death and falling life expectancy, Lebed says he stopped drinking so that he "would be the only sober man in this drunken country."  For this he was widely applauded.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lebed has a tough fight ahead of him, perhaps the most difficult battle of his career. The prize is the Russian government. The nationalist field in Russian politics is getting crowded. "Liberal-Democratic" Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Gennady Ziuganov of the Communist Party, former Vice President Rutskoi, former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov, and others are vying for the mantle of "most patriotic" leader. Whoever emerges will have to face President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, or Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky in the presidential elections of 1996.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	If he throws his hat into the presidential ring, Lebed will have one thing working for him:  his skill in tapping two major themes in today's Russian politics -- wounded national pride and the law-and-order crusade. The Russian voters seem to be buying Lebed's simple message. It remains to be seen whether they will buy him as their next leader.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On June 16, Russian voters across 11 time zones will vote for their next president. This will be a hard choice. The decision Russians will make is not only about the personalities of the candidates. It also is about what direction Russia will take in domestic and international policy. At stake is nothing less than whether there will be continued cooperation or renewed conflict between Russia and the West.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boris Yeltsin, the incumbent, presided over the collapse of communism and the Soviet Union but now faces a resurgent Communist Party calling for the restoration of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin's opponent is Gennady Zyuganov, head of the Communist Party. Yeltsin was trailing Zyuganov in the polls until mid-May, but now they are running neck-and-neck, with each candidate receiving a 28-30 percent approval rating.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are other contenders in the presidential election as well: for example, liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky, the most pro-reform and pro-Western of all the candidates, including Yeltsin; nationalist General Alexander Lebed; neo-fascist Vladimir Zhirinovsky; and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The free-market, democratic alternative personified by Yavlinsky remains weak. He is expected to receive only 8-10 percent of the vote. While surprises are always possible, the race appears to have come down to a choice between Boris Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov. Yeltsin's record has been marred by the unsuccessful war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and the skyrocketing levels of crime and corruption, while communist turned nationalist Gennady Zyuganov has been compared to a Russian Slobodan Milosevic armed with nuclear weapons.<sup>1</sup>  With almost one-third of the voters still undecided and popular discontent with Russia's current situation so widespread, it will be difficult, though not impossible, for Yeltsin to win.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Electoral Behavior.</b> According to recent polls, over 70 percent of the Russian people blame Boris Yeltsin for their difficult economic situation; 92 percent consider their economy to be in "bad" or "critical" condition.<sup>2</sup>  In a poll taken in January 1996, 56 percent of the respondents said Yeltsin should resign immediately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This distress is understandable. While privatization has occurred, the main beneficiaries have been the old communist elite and the criminal element. With the rule of law conspicuously absent, Russian society has fallen prey to an unprecedented wave of crime and corruption. Many in the electorate believe that the situation is Yeltsin's fault, and so are attracted to the communists. Indeed, over 50 percent of those polled indicated that they would not fear a Communist Party takeover.<sup>3</sup>  In fact, many see the communists as the only party capable of providing a social safety net and safeguards against rampant crime.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The elderly, who make up Russia's most active voting bloc, are staunchly pro-communist, nostalgic for a mythic Soviet past, and opposed to reforms by a margin of two to one. By contrast, young voters under 30 years old tend to be pro-reform, but their support for Yeltsin is soft, and their turnout is expected to be low.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Election Mechanics.</b> Russian law allows anyone who registers and collects one million signatures to run for president. The Central Electoral Commission (CEC), nominated jointly by both houses of the Russian parliament and the president, approves the signatures and certifies the candidates as eligible to run. In 1996, 42 candidates threw their hats in the ring, and 11 were approved by the CEC. A voter turnout below 50 percent would invalidate the election, in which case Yeltsin would remain in office and new elections would have to be scheduled within three months.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Russian elections are conducted by paper ballot: pre-printed sheets of paper on which voters check off the names of their preferred candidates. The results are aggregated by local and regional electoral commissions and then transferred electronically to a central computer run by the CEC. Reportedly, the security service in charge of electronic communications (known by the Russian acronym FAPSI) is in charge of the data processing. It is controlled by the Yeltsin administration, a fact which raises some questions concerning the reliability of the vote count.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the runoff, scheduled for 15 days after the results of the first round are counted if no candidate wins a clear majority, the two top candidates will face each other. Presumably, they will be Boris Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov. Currently, Yeltsin is slowly pulling ahead of his formidable rival.
<p>

<b>BORIS YELTSIN: THE SITTING CZAR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At 65 years of age, Boris Yeltsin has all the advantages and handicaps of incumbency. While he is blamed for falling living standards and other social ills, he is also a known quantity and a guarantor of stability. Despite his communist roots, Yeltsin has cast himself as an anti-communist during this campaign.<sup>5</suP>  Certain sectors of Russian society, especially the business elite and intellectuals, fear a communist restoration and prefer Yeltsin as the lesser of two evils. Yeltsin is particularly strong with urban, educated voters under 35 years old and with the business community.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But Yeltsin's anti-communist claims are somewhat disingenuous. The survivors in his administration are former party <I>apparatchiks</I> or communist industrial managers, including hard-line chief of staff Nikolay Yegorov, Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, and many others. Radical reformers have not fared nearly as well. Over the past four years, they have been forced out of the Yeltsin government, and Soviet-era <I>nomenklatura</I> now occupy most of the key posts. This phenomenon was epitomized by the nomination of the hard-line Russian Foreign Intelligence Service chief, Yevgenii Primakov, to the post of Foreign Minister in the fall of 1995. Primakov spent a lifetime in the Soviet foreign intelligence service, becoming one of Leonid Brezhnev's top Middle Eastern policymakers. He has personal ties to the Islamic fundamentalist regime in Tehran, as well as to both Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Muammar Qadhafi.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin increasingly has adopted old communist symbols as a way to take votes away from Zyuganov. For example, he gave an order to have the old red banners flown during the most recent celebration of V-E day on May 9. Moreover, surrounded by generals, he delivered a speech from the podium on top of Lenin's mausoleum and addressed the veterans as "comrades."  He has become more favorably disposed to the idea of interfering in the Russian "near abroad."  Indeed, Russian troops are stationed in Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Belarus, and Tajikistan, and Russia is pursuing an ambitious policy of integrating the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the loose confederation formed upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. This integration includes cooperation between the former KGB security services as well as among border guard troops, joint air defenses, and far-reaching economic policy coordination.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin has brought in a number of leading politicians, including some democrats, to work on his campaign. His former chief of staff, Sergei Filatov, former First Deputy Prime Minister and architect of privatization Anatoly Chubais, and Independence Television (NTV) Executive Director Victor Malashenko are among the leading Russian liberals working for him. Former acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar has endorsed Yeltsin, despite their bitter disagreements over the war in Chechnya.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to the pitfalls faced by any incumbent, Yeltsin has made several mistakes that have come to haunt him. First, he still has not ended the fighting in Chechnya, despite the recent cease-fire which may or may not hold. Even if Chechnya remains a part of the Russian Federation, the high casualty figures (over 30,000 dead and more than 400,000 refugees) and the sheer brutality of the war will dog Yeltsin throughout the election.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin's Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, is extremely unpopular not only inside the Russian armed forces, but with the general population as well. He is held responsible for the abysmal performance of the Russian military in Chechnya and for the widespread and growing corruption. Grachev is famous for his opulent lifestyle and goes by the nickname "Pashka the Mercedes."  Reformers want to replace Grachev with a civilian, but they have been thwarted by military leaders who resist both civilian control of the armed forces and overdue reforms of the bloated and rusty Russian war machine. Yeltsin apparently either prefers to stick with the loyal and controllable Grachev or is incapable of finding a suitable replacement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of Yeltsin's biggest political failures has been his refusal to create a political party of his own. The 500,000-strong communists are the leading political force in the country, beating the Yeltsin campaign in grass-roots organizing, turn-out-the-vote tactics, and pre-election meetings. Yeltsin controls the electronic media and the state budget. Everywhere he goes, he promises state subsidies for enterprises and other would-be constituencies. But most Russian voters are fed up with his promises. Lacking a political base outside of government, Yeltsin may discover -- as Central and East European reform governments already have -- that controlling the media is no guarantee of victory.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Rampant crime and corruption continue to plague Yeltsin's presidency. He could use a crime fighter in a prominent position, such as head of the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) or head of the Internal Security Services (FSB). Instead, the current Minister of the Interior, who is in charge of the police, is known more for opposing privatization and denouncing foreigners than for combating crime. General Mikhail Barsukov, Director of the FSB and Yeltsin's confidante, has lately embarked on a spy-catching mission, hurting Russia's relations with the West in the process. His latest "success" was uncovering an alleged British spy ring. Yet the arrest may have been little more than a cover-up for Russian organized crime outfits supplying the Irish Republican Army (IRA) with weapons, and possibly with nuclear materials.<sup>7</sup>  Yeltsin's lack of leadership in the war on crime has been a great handicap, raising serious questions about the extent of corruption in his administration.

<p>
<b>GENNADY ZYUGANOV: THE COMMUNIST CHALLENGER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin's main challenger is Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.<sup>8</sup>  The 52-year-old Zyuganov is a quintessential Communist Party <I>apparatchik</I> who rose steadily through the ranks of the Soviet power structure, only to have it destroyed by Gorbachev's <I>glasnost</I> and <I>perestroika</I>.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov believes in the imminent collapse of Western civilization. He refers to the West as "ultra-materialist, selfish and spiritless" and regards the reforms of the 1980s as the greatest treason executed against Russia by Western intelligence agencies and their agents in Russia (the reformers). He also has condemned both former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin as traitors.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov deeply distrusts the West and is preoccupied with restoring Russia's "old glory."  He articulates the frustration of those who see Russia as a wounded superpower betrayed by its leadership and relegated by scheming adversaries to the sidelines of history. Parallels between pre-Hitler Germany, which had just lost World War I, and Russia, which was defeated in the Cold War, are too obvious to be ignored.<sup>9</sup>  Russian communists and nationalists, like the German Nazis before them, are appealing to the sort of militant and xenophobic nationalism that leads inevitably to disastrous military adventures.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov has revised communist ideology, making it more nationalistic and imperialistic than in the Soviet era. He offers an ideology to fill the spiritual void left by the collapse of the USSR -- something Yeltsin has failed to do.<sup>10</sup>  But Zyuganov's message is poisonous. He speaks and writes about a Western conspiracy, led by the U.S. and aimed at destroying first the Soviet Union and then Russia. As Zyuganov tells it, Gorbachev and Yeltsin are traitors, and the U.S. is the embodiment of all that is evil in the world; corrupt and materialistic, the U.S. and the West are doomed. At the same time, however, Zyuganov and his aides talk about the need for trade and investment with the West, and Zyuganov touts himself as a pragmatic, even pro-business Russian leader when speaking to Westerners. Like Lenin, Stalin, and Brezhnev before him, Zyuganov talks the tough anti-Western line at home but tries to portray himself as an innocuous reformer interested in Western investment when talking to Western audiences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Flirting with God.</b> In their attempt to build a broad nationalist-communist coalition, the "new" communists have even dropped the traditional atheism from their party's platform. Today, an open believer can be a member of the party, but only if he is a member of "the three Russian traditional denominations" -- Orthodoxy, Islam, or Buddhism. This newly professed religious tolerance does not apply to Protestants, Catholics, or Jews, however, despite their deep roots in Russia. According to the communist-sponsored draft law on religion (vetoed previously by President Yeltsin), these minority denominations would become subject to severe regulation by the state. Unchecked, the communists conceivably could move to ban Western-based Protestant denominations outright. In order to steal religion's thunder, Zyuganov has announced that the socialist ideas he espouses are grounded in the 2,000-year-old Christian tradition and have deep roots in the Russian Orthodox Church.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While not personally charismatic, Zyuganov is a master tactician whose organizational skills have won grudging praise from his opponents. He organized the resurgence of the Communist Party after the blow it suffered in the 1991 coup. He won in court against proceedings initiated by the Yeltsin administration to ban the party in 1993 and then led the party to electoral victory in the Duma elections of December 1995. Zyuganov also is credited with building a broad coalition with the nationalists for the 1996 presidential elections.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Communist Party has the strongest organization in Russia. No one, including President Yeltsin, can match its network of political hacks, propagandists, union organizers, and influence peddlers. The party enjoys unparalleled popularity in the cash-starved military, obsolete heavy industry, and inefficient agricultural sectors and has largely restored its network of grass-roots cells in factories, schools, universities, and government offices. As in Soviet times, membership is by co-optation only, and three recommendations from party members in good standing are needed in order to join. Thus, the party is not a mass political movement in the Western sense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov is considered a moderate by Communist Party standards, and there are many, both within and outside the party, who are more hard-line than he. Some of these allies, such as Viktor Anpilov, head of the Marxist-Leninist "Labor Russia" movement, support Zyuganov only on condition that he drop any kind of social democratic rhetoric. Anpilov believes in shooting and jailing political opponents and is vitriolic in his denunciations of the West. In the future, Zyuganov may be challenged and replaced by a more orthodox communist; he also could be challenged successfully by such other contenders as Valentian Kuptsov, former chairman and current number two figure in the party, or Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznev.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While Yeltsin and Zyuganov most probably will remain the two front-runners for the presidency, three other candidates could break into the second round of elections. If Yeltsin stumbles -- for example, if he is incapacitated or there is a major terrorist event, possibly triggered by the war in Chechnya -- one of the following candidates could appeal to Russian voters and cut Yeltsin out of the runoff elections.

<P>
<b>GRIGORY YAVLINSKY: THE REFORMERS' BEST HOPE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of "Yabloko," a reformist party with social democratic leanings and the only free-market party left in the Duma, is projected to receive about 10 percent of the popular vote in the first round of the upcoming elections. His supporters are those who did not gain property or power in the economic reform but still have anti-communist, pro-free market, and democratic convictions. His core support is in large cities, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, among students, the intelligentsia, and some entrepreneurs. Yavlinsky rose to prominence by attacking former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and President Yeltsin for mistakes committed during the implementation of economic reforms, although today he admits that Gaidar's reforms were "mostly correct."<sup>11</sup>  He is the author of the reformist 500-day program, which was rejected by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 and never implemented.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Born in Lviv, Ukraine, and 44 years old, Yavlinsky is the most Westernized of all the presidential candidates. He speaks English well and has a long-standing academic relationship with Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Western free-market economists sometimes consider his policies too Keynesian and inflationary, and many of the policies he advocates, such as raising pensions and salaries in the state sector, could lead to increased public spending and inflation if implemented.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yavlinsky strongly opposes the war in Chechnya, and his criticism of Yeltsin's policies in Chechnya have split traditional democratic reformers. Those who support the war, such as former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, also support Boris Yeltsin; those who oppose the war -- for example, Andrey Sakharov's widow Elena Bonner and Yeltsin's former Human Rights Commissioner, Sergei A. Kovalev -- support Yavlinsky. Yavlinsky criticizes the Yeltsin administration for violating human rights (especially in the Chechen conflict), allowing corruption to spread, and neglecting the rule of law. He also favors full economic integration of the Commonwealth of Independent States under the aegis of Russia. Such a merger would include a common market of goods, services, and labor, and possibly a single currency. At the same time, however, Yavlinsky recognizes the need for these countries to preserve their independence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yavlinsky lacks a strong party machine, is a poor campaigner, and has largely run out of funds. In addition, many in the democratic camp have not forgiven his vitriolic attacks on former Yeltsin Prime Minister and democrat Yegor Gaidar. Today, it does not appear that Yavlinsky can beat either Yeltsin or Zyuganov in the first round of elections; therefore, he is unlikely to be a strong challenger in the second round.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin and Yavlinsky have conducted negotiations that could lead to Yavlinsky's withdrawing his candidacy in favor of Yeltsin, but these talks so far have been inconclusive. Yeltsin, hoping to receive several million of Yavlinsky's votes, has stated that, if re-elected, he would offer Yavlinsky the post of First Deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic reform.<sup>12</sup>  This post, formerly occupied by the dynamic Anatoly Chubais, is occupied currently by industrialist Vladimir Kadannikov, who lacks strong credentials as a reformer. Yavlinsky is holding out, hoping for a strong showing in the first round of the elections, and possibly that he will be offered the post of Prime Minister if Yeltsin's position seems desperate enough. As his price for supporting Yeltsin for president, Yavlinsky also is demanding an end to the war in Chechnya and the firing of some the hard-liners in the current administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yavlinsky could win in his campaign dealings with Yeltsin, or he could destroy his political future and reputation. If his demands are accepted, and if he can secure some guarantees that Yeltsin will not fire him, he could jump-start the economic reforms, end the war in Chechnya, and become the recognized leader of the democratic camp, greatly enhancing his chances of becoming the next president of Russia. He also could be pushed aside by Yeltsin after the election, meeting the same fate as Gaidar and Chubais. In short, lacking a strong political party machine, financial support, and executive experience, Yavlinsky could join the Yeltsin administration without enough power to accomplish anything, condemning himself to a swift political demise.
<p>

<b>VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY: THE WILD CARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky became an internationally recognized figure when his organization, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), gained almost 25 percent of Russia's electoral vote in the State Duma elections on December 12, 1993. His main slogans in the 1993 campaign were "I will not allow anybody to abuse Russians" and "I will make Russia rise from its knees."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zhirinovsky was a military intelligence officer before becoming a lawyer. He later worked for a KGB-run organization which established and maintained contact with foreign students. Allegations by Mikhail Gorbachev and Alexander Yakovlev, as well as these early intelligence connections and mysterious cash inflows early in his party's activities, indicate that the Russian security services launched his political career. In the December 1995 Duma elections, Zhirinovsky garnered over 10 percent of the vote, well ahead of predictions. He is projected to receive about the same percentage, or somewhat less, in the June presidential elections.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, he is running the most low-profile campaign in his political history, freely proclaiming that Yeltsin is going to be re-elected. This is most uncharacteristic behavior for the ambitious Zhirinovsky, who normally would conduct the most aggressive campaign, heavily emphasizing media coverage and mass rallies. Many observers speculate that his passivity indicates that the Russian security services may still control Zhirinovsky, and that Yeltsin's entourage has been able to neutralize him as a threat. Moscow-based observers believe that Zhirinovsky either was bought off or was blackmailed into silence. Meanwhile, Zhirinovsky states publicly that he is focusing his political effort on the year 2000, building his party and leaving someone else to take responsibility for the disastrous situation of the Russian state.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The name of Zhirinovsky's party is dangerously misleading. Many Westerners probably assume the Liberal Democrats really are liberal and democratic. In fact, however, they are neither; if anything, they are national socialists. Launched in the latter years of the Soviet Union with the encouragement and participation of top Communist Party and KGB officials, the LDPR is an ultra-nationalist party that stands for Russian imperial revival. While declaring limited support for markets and private property, Zhirinovsky favors a large government sector in the economy and a strong military-industrial complex. His statements on the restoration of the Russian Empire, including Alaska, Poland, and Finland, are particularly troublesome. In his book <I>The Last Thrust South</I>, he said that he will not rest until Russian soldiers wash their boots in the Indian Ocean. His foreign political allies include Jean Marie Le Pen's French National Front, the German and Austrian Neo-Nazis, and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath party.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Publicly audacious, Zhirinovsky has become one of the most successful post-communist politicians. The LDPR today is the second-largest political party in Russia, second only to the communists. With many regional and local organizations and several party newspapers, its organization is larger than anything the reformers, or even President Yeltsin himself, can claim. A gifted speaker with a sense of humor and a penchant for one-liners, Zhirinovsky is probably Russia's best political campaigner. He performs well on television and is entertaining when interviewed. He also has gained popularity with many young voters through his intensive use of pop and rock music and his regular and open discussion of sex. He shamelessly promotes himself through brand names, such as Zhirinovsky vodka and clothing, and owns a Zhirinovsky store in Moscow which sells Zhirinovsky T-shirts, rock and punk music, and even Zhirinovsky matchboxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zhirinovsky's past election successes have sent chills through Russians, Eastern Europeans, and citizens of the former Soviet republics. He stands for the restoration of the Russian Empire as a unitary state, and for an aggressive foreign policy in Central Europe and the Middle East. He would accomplish this through military power, which could lead to a major clash with the West. Any sign of his advance to the pinnacle of power in Russia would be tantamount to a political earthquake.
<p>
<b>GENERAL ALEXANDER LEBED: NO COLIN POWELL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
General Alexander Ivanovich Lebed emerged at the front of Russia's political stage in 1994-1995, when he served as commander of the 14th Army Russian troops occupying part of Moldova. For a while, he was the most popular politician in Russia. Currently, he is polling at about 5 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed was the classmate of current Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who was also Lebed's commander and mentor in the paratrooper academy in the city of Ryazan. Initially, his career was attached to Grachev's; they both fought, for example, in Afghanistan. As the USSR was collapsing, Lebed was involved in "peacemaking" operations, suppressing popular rebellions in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Lithuania.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed positioned himself as a tough crime fighter, the outsider who feels the pain of ordinary people and of the military rank and file. He fought the appointment of the notoriously corrupt General Matvey Burlakov as first deputy defense minister in the fall of 1994, with the result that Burlakov was fired. To protest corruption in the Trans-Dniester region, he resigned from the parliament of this ethnically Slavic enclave. While the Soviet and Russian military was collapsing, Lebed managed to build and train a surprisingly fit military force.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed retired from command of the 14th Army in June of 1995, losing the aura of the persecuted hero speaking for the disgruntled Russian army. He is seen by some in the career military as having pushed the army toward confrontation with the defense minister and the president, eroding the military's neutrality and its position "outside of politics."  Lebed also is faulted by some for using his command to boost his political image.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed's political career has turned out to be less spectacular than his military adventures. He is not only blunt, but abrasive. He has stated publicly that "to conduct diplomatic negotiations with some parliament to receive power" and "maneuver" is not his style.<sup>14</sup>  "For idiots who did not get it the first time," he once told a press conference, "I repeat, I do not comment on Chechnya."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the December 1995 Duma elections, Lebed was vice chairman of the nationalist Union of Russian Communities, headed by Soviet-era industrial stalwart Yurii Skokov. The general and his party did poorly in these elections, primarily because of Skokov's mismanagement of the campaign. The Union failed to garner enough votes to be represented in the Duma, damaging Lebed's stature as a challenger for the presidency in the upcoming elections of 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If he ever did become president or even defense minister, Lebed might push Russia toward confrontation with her neighbors and the West. He has said repeatedly that enlarging NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia would be a <I>casus belli</I> for World War III. "The West is wiping its feet all over Russia," he has said. He is deeply suspicious of the West, and particularly of the U.S., and as the quintessential Soviet military man sees Russia expressing herself as a Great Power only through military strength and territorial aggrandizement. Still, he seems to have mellowed, tends to identify himself as an anti-communist and anti-establishment, and has received a crash course in market economics from the Moscow liberal economists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite his appeal, the majority of the Russian public believes that an active-duty or even a former military man should not be president. Lebed's chances today do not seem particularly high, though he could siphon off some of Zyuganov's and Yeltsin's support.


<P>
<b>"THIRD TIER" CANDIDATES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of the following candidates are registered to run in the elections, although none appears to have a good chance of achieving a strong showing in the first round.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Aman Geldy Tuleev.</b> This hard-line communist leader was born in Krasnovodsk, Turkmenistan, in 1944. A graduate of the Novosibirsk Railroad Engineering Institute, he served from March 1990 to October 1993 as speaker of the Kemerovo Region Soviet. In 1991, Tuleyev ran for president of Russia, finishing fifth. Since April 1994, he has served as speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the Kemerovo Region. Tuleyev is a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. For reasons probably better known to party insiders, he has promised to withdraw his candidacy and endorse Gennady Zyuganov but has not yet pulled out of the race. Tuleev is close to Zyuganov politically and is seen as a reserve player for the communists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Martin Shakkum.</b> A dark horse candidate with ties to the powerful Russian military industry, Martin Shakkum was born in the Moscow region in 1951. He graduated from a military engineering academy, earned a degree in civil engineering by correspondence, and holds a Ph.D. in political science. He worked for the Institute of Space Research from 1976 to 1978, after which he held a sequence of managerial positions in construction (in the Mosinzhremont and Glavmosoblstroy state-run companies). In 1990, Shakkum became CEO of the RIDA joint enterprise. He currently is first vice president of the International Fund of Economic and Social Reforms (the Reform Fund), which started out as moderately reformist but now takes increasingly hard-line positions. In 1992-1993, Shakkum served as a consultant to former Vice Premier Georgy Khizha, who was in charge of the military-industrial complex in the Yeltsin cabinet and known as a hard-liner. Since April 1996, Shakkum has led the Russian Socialist Popular Party. He is a nationalist and anti-Western politician.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Vladimir Bryntsalov.</b> This colorful candidate represents the nascent Russian business class. Bryntsalov was born in 1946 in the city of Cherkessk in Stavropol province. After graduating from the Novocherkassk Polytechnic Institute in 1969, he taught at the Cherkassk Polytechnic College and then worked in construction. In 1987, he started an agricultural cooperative. Toward the end of the 1980s, Bryntsalov became head of the Moscow Drug Manufacturers' Association, which later became Ferane, a major joint-stock enterprise. A multimillionaire, Bryntsalov is a Duma member (elected in December 1995) and both founder and leader (since April 1996) of the Russian Socialist Party. Bryntsalov espouses a combination of nationalist and socialist views.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Yuri Vlasov.</b> This nationalist candidate was born in 1935. He was the superheavyweight world champion in weight-lifting in 1959, 1961, 1962, and 1963, and Olympic superheavyweight champion in 1960. Vlasov set many weight-lifting records and was nicknamed "the strongest man on Earth."  He also was the young Arnold Schwarzenegger's role model. A 1959 graduate of the Zhukovsky Air-Force Engineering Academy, he later became a writer.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yuri Vlasov presents himself as a "patriot" fighting communism and the Zionist conspiracy against the Russian people. He participated in the December 1995 parliamentary elections on the list of the leftist Power to the People but failed to gain a seat in the Duma, losing to Konstantin N. Borovoi, a prominent businessman and leader of the right-of-center Party of Economic Freedom, in Tushino.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Svyatoslav Fyodorov.</b> Fyodorov is a successful and prosperous eye surgeon who recently has gone into politics, polling at only about 6 percent in the current presidential race. He was something of a national hero even under Brezhnev. In 1995, he formed his centrist Workers' Self-Government Party. He advocates the mass creation of joint stock companies to guarantee workers a share of profits, the removal of most taxes, and a ban on the export of most raw materials. He presents himself as a third force in Russian politics, claiming that he draws his inspiration from former U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot and China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Mikhail Gorbachev.</b> The former Soviet leader is still popular in the West for his role in ending the Cold War and bringing about the end of the Communist Party's monopoly on power. But his popularity at home is close to zero, and no major political force has ventured to back him. Only some aging Moscow intellectuals sing his praises, and even the news-hungry Russian media are ignoring the man who helped bring down the Soviet empire. His chances in the elections are close to zero.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact that the presidential elections are taking place at all indicates how far Russia has progressed on the road to freedom. But the fact that there is no viable democratic, pro-free market front-runner demonstrates how long it will be before Russia achieves genuine democracy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Russian democrats, with the exception of the left-of-center Grigory Yavlinsky and his Yabloko, erred in failing to create a viable political party. This failure has contributed significantly to their loss of voter appeal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, the June elections present the Russian voters with a rather unhappy choice. If they vote for Yeltsin, they will be choosing haphazard reforms accompanied by lawlessness and corruption. If the communists win, the majority of Russian voters may be choosing a massive renationalization of property and an attempt to restore the Russian empire.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A communist victory in Russia this summer would be a major setback for democracy, although it would not necessarily be a vote of no confidence against free markets and democracy. The Yeltsin administration's implementation of reform has been extremely inept, mired in a degree of corruption unprecedented even by Russian standards. Instead of attaining a market economy, the Russian voters have been confronted largely by a caricature, in many cases presided over by the same old Soviet <I>nomenklatura</I> clad in new suits and driving new cars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A communist ascendancy most probably would result not in a new totalitarianism, but in severe crisis and the final disillusionment of the Russian people with the communist idea.<sup>15</sup>  Despite difficulties and setbacks, the ideas behind free markets and political democracy are developing roots in Russia, especially among the young generation. Neither the old nor the "new" communist and nationalist ideologies appears to have the power to mobilize the people and resources of today's Russia to create a second version of the Soviet Brave New World.

<html><head><title>Linda Chavez</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><center><h3>Linda Chavez</h3></center><hr>

<i>The New York Times</i> calls Linda Chavez "an influential voice on civil rights policy." <i>The Washington Post</I> describes her as one of "a new generation of intellectuals [seeking] to question the orthodoxies of the civil rights establishment" 
 <P>
Chavez is President of the Center for Equal Opportunity, based in Washington. She is the author of <I>Out of 
the Barrio: Toward a New Politics of Hispanic Assimilation</i> (Basic Books, 1991) which chronicles the 
untold story of Hispanic progress and achievement and addresses the implications of bilingual education, voting rights, immigration, and Affirmative action. The Denver Post said that this book "should explode the stereotypes about Hispanics that have clouded the minds of patronizing liberals and xenophobic conservatives alike." 
 <P>
Many know Chavez from her weekly column in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a>, which appears each Wednesday. She writes often for many other publications, including the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>The New Republic, Commentary</i>, and <i>Crisis</i>. She also makes regular appearances on "The McLaughlin Group," "To the Contrary," "CNN & Co.," "Equal Time " and "The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour." 
 <P>
Chavez has held a number of political positions, among them <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> Director of Public Liaison (1985) and Director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1983-85). She won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator from Maryland (1986), but lost in the general election. Before that, Chavez 
was editor of the prizewinning quarterly journal of the American Federation of Teachers, <i>American Educator</I> (1977-83). She also serves as U.S. Expert on the United Nations Subcommission on Human 
Rights. 
 <P>
Chavez is currently at work on her second book, <i>A House Divided: Race and the Politics of Multiculturalism</I>.

<i><font size="-1">Town Hall is the first truly
interactive community
on the Internet to bring Internet users and public policy organizations together under the broad 
umbrella of "conservative" thoughts, ideas and 
actions.  Our goal is to become the mall of ideas in which people congregate
to exchange, discuss and disseminate the latest news and information.  Town Hall is 
committed to inform, educate and entertain the public through this emerging electronic medium.
<P>
The organizations that have chosen to become citizens of Town Hall do not agree on 
every issue, yet that is why Town Hall believes our community is of value.  An 
interactive, open and honest debate of the issues within the conservative community 
will help us all in the fight against those who would sacrifice the individual and freedom
 for 
political gain and big government.

<h2>
INSIDE REPORT<br>
GOP: NOT COLORBLIND
</h2>
<h3>
Robert D. Novak
</h3>
<i>July 15, 1996</i>

</center>

<dd>SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- It is not just presidential candidate Robert J. 
Dole who has backed away from the drive to end racial preferences in 
California. So has the national Republican establishment.
<P>
<dd>House Speaker Newt Gingrich has publicly recommended that Dole not 
actively campaign for the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) to bar 
government affirmative action programs that practice racial 
discrimination. Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour has been 
lukewarm. Jack Kemp has all but opposed the initiative. 
<P>
<dd>So have leaders of giant California-based corporations, whose 
pocketbooks are open to Dole but not CCRI. Fund-raising efforts beyond 
the state's borders have flopped, with normally conservative money 
sources in New York saying no. 
<P>
<dd>In contrast, actively and financially aligned in opposition to the initiative 
are the education establishment, organized labor, the Democratic Party, 
minority-group activists and assorted foundations. "Everyone is against 
us," Ward Connerly, a University of California regent and CCRI state 
chairman, told me. "Everybody but the people." 
<P>
<dd>That is an exaggeration. California Republicans such as State GOP 
Chairman John Herrington, Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle and 
especially Gov. Pete Wilson are solidly supportive. But the real push for 
a colorblind system does come from the public, holding steady at 65 
percent in some polls.
<P>
<dd>Given that popularity, why would Dole back away from CCRI? Arnie 
Steinberg, the veteran political operative managing the proposal, blames 
"country-club Republicans." 
<P>
<dd>One of California's leading corporate executives, a conservative 
Republican, cannot speak on the record because his company has not 
decided whether to oppose CCRI. But he defined his personal views: "If 
we do away with affirmative action, what happens to these young people? 
I worry about the third big riot in Los Angeles."
<P>
<dd>Similar concern was expressed by George Deukmejian, former two-term 
Republican governor of California, when he declined to support the 
initiative and then told of his epiphany. Since he now has to drive his 
own car through the racially diverse streets of Los Angeles, he perceives 
a dangerously "fragile" city.
<P>
<dd>Such talk infuriates Sacramento management consultant Connerly, an 
African-American who contends that big businessmen are seeking 
government protection for their own racial preference policies. He points 
to last month's Los Angeles Times poll of the city's voters showing 69 
percent support for CCRI, including 56 percent from blacks and 68 
percent from Hispanics. He considers absurd the danger of underclass 
blacks rioting because they want to go to Berkeley and demeaning the 
notion that African-Americans can get there only with special 
preferences. 
<P>
<dd>Connerly, who became a Republican in the late 1960s when he observed 
then Gov. Ronald Reagan upholding the rights of the individual, mourns 
the lost political opportunity. A Dole delegate to the GOP national 
convention, Connerly wants his candidate to use this popular issue to 
erase the California gap between him and Bill Clinton. One of the 
president's managers here says privately that while he must oppose CCRI, 
the less Clinton says about it, the better.
<P>
<dd>But it was Dole on his last California visit who ignored CCRI, and 
Connerly privately took issue with him. The response came from Dole's 
wife, Elizabeth, who asked what the initiative would do to "outreach" 
programs. Nothing, Connerly replied, so long as there are no racial 
preferences. But, she persisted, what about "compensatory outreach," 
such as she practiced as secretary of labor?  That suggested the thinking 
of the Doles was frozen in outmoded cliches.
<P>
<dd>Dole's agents ambiguously assure CCRI that he will be aboard the effort. 
When Wilson telephoned Gingrich to protest his contrary advice to Dole, 
the speaker told the governor he would help raise funds for the initiative. 
But skepticism abounds about promises from Washington. "I have never 
in my life been lied to so much and double-crossed so often," Steinberg 
told me.
<P>
<dd>Connerly describes CCRI this way: "This is a defining issue between 
Dole and Clinton. It is the right thing to do, good for the country, good 
for the party. If an incompetent Republican Party cannot understand this, 
it deserves its fate." He is implying that whether Dole ends his retreat on 
a colorblind society may determine not only whether he carries California 
but whether he deserves to.

Snow: MR. WILLPOWER - July 15, 1996

<h2>MR. WILLPOWER</h2>
<h3>Tony Snow</h3>
<i>July 15, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<dd>WASHINGTON -- It's as close as you get to a right-wing intellectual 
salon in Washington: Each Wednesday morning, a group of conservative 
political operatives gathers at the offices of Americans for Tax Reform 
and talks about how to create a limited-government movement as durable 
and inspiring as FDR's New Deal bureaucracy. 
<p>
<dd>Until recently, these cabals had a festive air about them. The attendees -- 
mostly guys -- predicted great things and called key politicians by their 
first names, as in: "Newt says ..." 
<p>
<dd>Then came Bob Dole, who in 100 days has done more to dampen 
regulars' spirits than Bill Clinton possibly could do in 1000. One stalwart 
confessed after last week's confab: "People are getting worried. It's white-
knuckle time now." 
<p>
<dd>Republicans have plenty of reasons to feel helpless. If there is one 
defining characteristic of Bob Dole, it's that he does things his way. Jim 
Lucier, a grandee at Americans for Tax Reform, notes that "Bob Dole is 
Mr. Willpower. He willed himself out of a hospital bed as a young man, 
and within two years won his first public office. He says, 'I know what I 
want, and that's the way it's going to be.' That's his secret. If he didn't 
have that ornery streak, he'd probably still be in a hospital bed." 
<p>
<dd>Yet that stubbornness has become a liability -- at least in the short run -- 
because candidate Dole possess two other, usually fatal traits. He has no 
discernible ideology, and he has no bosom buddies besides his wife. 
<p>
<dd>William F. Buckley tried to define the ideological problem in a recent 
interview with Sir David Frost. He described the difference between a 
lawmaker like Dole and a leader like Ronald Reagan as that between 
being "a conservative" and being "conservative." 
<p>
<dd>"A conservative," in the Buckley argot, enters public life to defend and 
extend a set of exalted values. Such a person trades in grand visions -- 
shining cities on the hill, for instance -- and invites voters to build a 
world defined by their dreams and aspirations. He gives everyone a stake 
in his success, and when he wins, so do his supporters. 
<p>
<dd>Dole, in contrast, approaches politics as a profession with set procedures 
and rituals. The good organization man wears the right clothes, adopts the 
proper opinions, follows the rules and attends no function that people 
have not paid to attend. This power-by-numbers approach works just 
dandy in the prim, hierarchical GOP. Today, after 36 years in 
Washington, all Dole's superiors have moved on or died -- and he stands 
atop the heap. Alone.
<p>
<dd>This triumph carries a special set of problems. Dole doesn't superintend a 
throng of admirers. He bestrides a tank packed with predatory would-be 
successors. Nobody cheers when he wins. Colleagues plot his removal. It 
is as if he has written a will, and everyone is lingering around, waiting for 
him to give them an opportunity to divide up the estate. 
<p>
<dd>This explains why a Dole event has all the electricity of a compulsory 
elementary-school lecture on the dangers of head lice. People appear out 
of duty, not passion. Even the candidate looks bored, as if someone 
dragged him into the hall. 
<p>
<dd>In an age when people venerate politicians with big hearts and profound 
senses of empathy, Dole keeps folks at bay with witty barbs and 
stultifying shows of jargon. When someone asked him about his position 
on welfare reform, he offered the timeless quip, "I'm in the conference 
(committee)." 
<p>
<dd>Hence, "white-knuckle time." Even though Republicans haven't held their 
nominating convention, many party elders have come to the conclusion 
that their man will lose unless Bill Clinton somehow winds up in the 
clink. They know Dole is Dole, and heartbreakingly, nobody will stand 
up for him unless first getting paid. 
<p>
<dd>If you don't believe it, think back to last week's hot controversy. Dole 
skipped the convention of the National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People. When the press began blasting him, only Sen. John 
McCain rose in his defense -- and McCain originally supported Phil 
Gramm. 
<p>
<dd>So we have the following weird situation. Dole stands alone and stands 
for nothing, yet Republicans know they owe their power to ideas. Let's 
face it, Gingrich and Co. are not just a bunch of pretty faces.  
<p>
<dd>As a result, members of his own party have begun planning an 
ideological takeover. If, within the next fortnight, he doesn't speak about 
key issues -- especially taxes, crime and quotas -- they will. And Bob 
Dole, Mr. Willpower, will be cast as a guy Americans should vote for not 
because he dares to lead, but because he will not get in the Republican 
Congress' way.

Sowell: THE GAY "MARRIAGE" ISSUE - July 18, 1996

<h2>
THE GAY "MARRIAGE" ISSUE
</h2>
<h3>Thomas Sowell</h3>
<i>July 18, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<dd>On an issue where misleading and dishonest statements have been the 
norm, it should hardly be surprising that the headline on the San 
Francisco Chronicle read: "House Votes Against Gay Marriages." The 
story claimed that the bill passed by the House was "a bill to restrict gay 
marriage."
<p>
<dd>In reality, after this vote you can still have all the gay marriages you want 
and any state that wants to recognize these marriages remains free to do 
so. What Congress refused to do was to force all 50 states to accord 
same-sex relationships the whole sweeping range of legislation that has 
been passed over the centuries, based on the assumption that this 
legislation would apply to a union between a man and a woman, who 
have the prospect of producing children that would have to be taken care 
of by them or by the society. 
<p>
<dd>Any state that wants to apply any or all of this legislation to homosexual 
unions remains free to do so after the House vote. What the gay activists 
and their allies in the liberal media wanted was for all states to be forced 
to do so, if any single state decided to recognize homosexual unions as 
marriages, superseding the previously defined sense of the term.
<p>
<dd>In other words, what they wanted was an end-run around the democratic 
process, so that they could piggy-back onto legislation passed with 
entirely different situations in mind. 
<p>
<dd>This is what the House of Representatives rejected -- and rightly so. If 
homosexuals want to participate in the democratic process and convince 
state legislatures to apply some or all of the laws that were passed for 
husband-wife unions and their offspring to same-sex relationships as 
well, they have every right to do so. 
<p>
<dd>They do not have a right to sneak in through the back door, pretending to 
be somebody else, just by using a word. 
<p>
<dd>The issue of gay marriages exposes the hypocrisy of what was once the 
homosexuals' strongest argument -- that what consenting adults do in 
private is nobody else's business. Now it is suddenly everybody else's 
business to recognize these liaisons and to confer on them all the legal 
prerogatives created for others. 
<p>
<dd>Serious changes in the law and public policy should be discussed 
seriously, not evaded by the verbal sleight-of-hand of using the word 
"marriage." Marriage is more than a contract between two individuals. It 
is an assertion of an interest in those people's relationship, and its possible 
offspring, by the society at large. 
<p>
<dd>Gay activists are trying to have it both ways. If it is none of my business 
what they do, then it is none of their business what I think about it. Nor 
should I be forced to recognize it in word or deed. 
<p>
<dd>Emotional assertions of how much homosexual relationships mean to 
those involved are relevant only to those people themselves, who are free 
to make whatever contractual relationships they wish with one another, 
and to solemnize their relationship in whatever ceremony they prefer. But 
that is very different from trying to drag the rest of us into this, willy-
nilly, through laws which our elected representatives never agreed to 
apply to them.
<p>
<dd>In a sense, the gay marriage issue is only a further extension of the notion 
that a "family" means whatever anybody wants it to mean. But there 
would never have been such a word in the language in the first place if 
any group of people, with any kind of relationship to one another, was 
considered the same as any other. 
<p>
<dd>Families are not baseball teams, corporations, marching bands or 
computer clubs. What the law has evolved over centuries of experience 
with families need not apply to any other kind of association. Calling 
other kinds of relationships "families" is playing games with words, 
submerging the very concept in a sea of verbal mush. 
<p>
<dd>What our laws, our values, and our analyses have said about families was 
not meant to apply to any old set of people that might later be fashionably 
analogized to families. Such word games may be very clever, but all that 
they boil down to is that all things are the same, except for the 
differences, and different except for the similarities.
<p>
<dd>Gay activists have also thrived on the confusion between homosexuals 
and members of racial or ethnic minorities. But you are black or white or 
Chinese or Cuban, regardless of how you behave. Homosexuality is 
defined by behavior. 
<p>
<dd>It is one thing to say that all people have the same rights, as the 14th 
Amendment does, and something very different to say that all behavior 
has the same rights. There is no reason why the law should make all 
behavior equally acceptable to all people or surround all behavior with 
legal obligations on others. Once more the call for "equal rights" has 
masked an attempt to get special privileges, without having to play by the 
rules.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>43 Taxes on Gas</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Peter J. Ferrara<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
 When you cruise on over to the gas station to fill
up your car's gas tank, you naturally assume that you are paying
for gas.  What you don't realize is that <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/gas1.html">over half of what you
pay goes to the government in taxes</a> rather than for the gas.</FONT>
<P>
The Federal government adds an excise tax of 18.3
cents on every gallon of gas.  Each state then adds an additional
excise tax now averaging 19.4 cents per gallon.  This adds up
to a total of 37.7 cents per gallon.  Based on recent price data
from the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department
of Energy, these taxes account for about 28% of what you pay for
a gallon of gas at the pump.</FONT>
<P>
 For a car with a standard 15 gallon gas tank, a
tax of 37.7 cents per gallon adds up to $5.66 per fill-up.  The
Tax Foundation estimates that the average American household will
spend $422 this year on these taxes alone.</FONT>
<P>
 But that is not all.  Before the gas even gets to
the station, the oil producer must pay considerable taxes on its
production and distribution.  These include Federal income taxes,
state income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, capital gains taxes,
unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's compensation taxes, local
property taxes, corporate franchise taxes, sales and use taxes,
and any local income taxes.  States impose severance taxes or
production taxes on each gallon of oil produced.  The companies
must also pay import duties on foreign oil, customs ad valorem
user fees, airport and airway trust fund taxes, harbor maintenance
trust fund taxes, refinery throughport taxes, and pipeline throughport
taxes.  Additional taxes include the corporate environmental tax,
the Superfund tax, the oil spill liability trust fund tax, the
leaking underground storage tank tax, the aquatic resources trust
fund tax, the inland waterways trust fund tax, and the used oil
disposal tax.</FONT>
<P>
 For delivery trucks, the producers must pay heavy
truck excise taxes, tire excise taxes, Federal gas taxes, state
gas taxes, heavy truck highway use taxes, environmental impact
taxes, public highway user taxes, and personal property taxes
on the vehicles.  Finally, the phones at the refinery or on the
pipeline are subject to 3% Federal tax on general telephone services
and another 3% tax on long distance.  Many states also add additional
taxes on telephones averaging another 2%.</FONT>
<P>
 Altogether, the government imposes 43 taxes on the
production of gas.</FONT>
<P>
 The taxes producers pay amount to about 26% of the
income received from the sale of oil and gas products like gasoline.
 As a result, counting the 28% in Federal and state excise taxes
discussed above, a grand total of 54% of what you pay for gas
at the pump goes to the government in taxes rather than for the
gas.</FONT>
<P>
 Suppose the gas you buy costs $1.33 per gallon,
which was the national average for all grades of gas in May. 
Of that total, 72.3 cents would go to the government in taxes,
and only 60.7 cents would remain with the oil producer.  For a
fill-up of a standard 15 gallon gas tank, $10.77 of what you pay
would go to the government in taxes rather than for the gas. 
And none of this counts the impact of regulation, much of which
maybe unnecessary, in increasing gas prices.</FONT>
<P>
 This incredible tax burden falls most harshly on
the poor.  According to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress,
the lowest 20% of income earners pay 7.1% of their incomes on
gas, while the top 20% only pay 1.6%.  In other words, the lowest
income families in America pay over 4 times as much of their incomes
on gas as the highest income earners.  As a result, the high taxes
embodied in the price of gas are consuming over 4 times as much
of the income of the poor as of the rich.</FONT>
<P>
 The excise taxes on gas used to be justified as
a user fee dedicated to paying for the roads.  But today 4.3 cents
of the 18.3 cent Federal excise tax is openly dedicated to general
government expenses rather than roads.  Another 2 cents is dedicated
to mass transit.</FONT>
<P>
 Much of the remainder has not been spent on roads
in recent years either.  Instead, the Federal government uses
the money for general expenses and puts an IOU in a so-called
Highway Trust Fund.  That IOU would be turned in for cash from
the government to be used for highways, if and when the Federal
government so chooses.</FONT>
<P>
 If you are concerned about the high cost of gasoline,
you should focus on the real problem -- your greedy and overreaching
government.</FONT>

<title>What Is Policy Review -- Heritage</title>
<META name="keyword" content="Policy Review: Journal of American Citizenship, community, conservative, journal, families, family, local, civic, religious, schools, education, citizens">
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<img src="/heritage/revpo.gif" width=169 height=79 alt="Policy Review" border=0></a>
<h2><i>POLICY REVIEW: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2></center>
<p>
<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, the flagship magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, is published 6 times per year. 
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> specializes in the study of private-sector and local-government alternatives to the bureaucratic, centralized welfare state. We are dedicated to rebuilding the institutions of American citizenship -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, public and private schools, voluntary civic institutions, businesses, and local governments.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> profiles great American citizens: Houston constable Victor Trevino is reducing crime with his "zebra squad" of volunteer cops; Sister Connie Driscoll is helping young urban mothers in Chicago; <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/tolerth.html">Rev. Frank Reid</a>, of Baltimore's AME Church, is promoting black Christian manhood to the members of his community.
<p>
We study "what works": <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/glassth.html">DeVry Institute of Technology</a> sets the standard for career training; Rhode Island's privatized school lunch program tastes better and costs less; private security officers reduce crime around New York's Grand Central Station. 
<p>
We tackle tough subjects, and propose common-sense policy prescriptions, for issues such as <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thegg.html">crime</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thfost.html">taxes</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thhood.html">environment</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thfinn.html">education</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thsher.html">religion and culture</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">adoption and foster care</a>, and <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thbear.html">Social Security</a>. We publish articles by influential people on the major issues of the day. Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/tharmey.html">Dick Armey</a>, Bill Bennett, Ralph Reed, Bill Kristol, Kate O'Beirne, Grover Norquist, and other key policy makers all contribute to <i>Policy Review</i>.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> provides practical, constructive thought -- the best of conservatism-in-action.

<b>The Heritage Foundation: Providing Practical Ideas for America's Future</b>
</center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the nation's leading think tank, The Heritage Foundation's impact on public policy is more pronounced than ever. As <I>The Wall 
Street Journal</I> wrote recently, "No policy shop has more clout than the conservative Heritage 
Foundation."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, many of the 104th Congress' plans for balancing 
the budget and scaling back big government began at Heritage. By providing official Washington 
with timely research and analysis, Heritage has become a primary information source for America's 
lawmakers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Heritage's people are more than just well-informed and 
well-educated. Many have hands-on government experience. They are doers as well as thinkers.  
Players, not just spectators. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you need a thought-provoking, articulate expert to 
discuss today's important issues, The Heritage Foundation is the place to turn. Contact 
<a href="mailto:moebiusw@heritage.org">Wanda Moebius</a> at (202) 675-1761 to book a speaker.

Welcome to the Town Hall CyberPersonality site!  I can assure you that this is certainly a new venture for me.  I've heard of "talking heads" from the likes of "Capitol Gang," and what used to be "MacNeil-Lehrer," but an on-line Internet personality is one of newest ways The Heritage Foundation would like to get past the limited amount of media coverage of hot issues and tell you what is really happening in Washington, on Capitol Hill, in the White House, and in policy circles.
<P>
A little bit about me -- I'm <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a>, and I'm primarily responsible for maintaining contact with the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</a>, educating the presidential campaigns on important policy issues, and overseeing The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/jobs/jobs.html">Job Bank</a>. I also serve as a spokesman for the Foundation on Heritage proposals and research findings in all areas of the Foundation's study.<p>


I'd like to tell you a little bit about what you can expect to see when you come to this site.  Of course, over the next several months, I'll be doing some fine-tuning to make this as interesting and informative as possible.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on what you'd like to see, and what would help you to keep on top of current issues. 
<p>
Twice a week -- on Tuesday and Friday -- I will be on-line to discuss hot topics on the Hill and elsewhere, and answer your questions.  I am also planning to post research materials, discuss what opinion leaders are saying, interview guests on politics and policy, and much more!  
<p>
What would you like to see? Please <a href="mailto:gabrona@heritage.org">email</a> your thoughts to me, or to <a href="mailto: gabrona@heritage.org">Andy Gabron</a>, who helps me with research
 for this page. I look forward to hearing from you!

Founded in 1973, The Heritage Foundation is a research and educational institute -- a think tank -- whose mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.
<P>
<A HREF= "/heritage/staff/stafftoc.html">Heritage's  staff</A> pursues this mission by performing timely accurate research addressing key policy 
issues and effectively marketing these findings to its primary audiences: members of Congress, key congressional staff members, policymakers in the executive branch, the nation's news media, and the academic and policy communities. Heritage's products include publications, articles, lectures, conferences, and meetings.
<P>
Governed by an independent Board of Trustees,The Heritage Foundation is a non-partisan, tax exempt institution. Heritage relies on the private financial support of the general public -- individuals, foundations, and corporations -- for its income, and accepts no government funds and performs no contract work. Heritage is one of the nation's largest public policy research organization. More than 200,000 contributors make it the most broadly supported in America.

<p>
Dear fellow conservative,
<p>
The Leadership Institute (LI) educates conservatives like you for participation in the public policy process.<p>
In 1995 2,426 people enrolled for LI schools all across the country. <p>
Most young men and women who come to my schools are already philosophically committed to the conservative values which keep America free and strong.  The staff and faculty of my schools reinforce that committment.<p>
But it is not sufficient to have the right ideas if you do not implement them.  As a conservative, you owe it to your philosophy to study how to win.<p>
Over the years I have learned that victory in a public policy contest is largely determined by the number and effectiveness of the activists on the respective sides.<p>
That's what the Leadership Institute is all about -- building responsible conservative leadership today, for the challenges of tomorrow.<p>
You should prepare yourself now to be effective in the public policy process.<p>
You could be one of the new leaders I train in 1996.<p>
You're welcome to attend any program listed on this Web site.  You may decide to attend more than one.  Many of the schools and services build on each other.<p>
<!--
If you are a high school or college student I urge you to start with my <a href="sc-yl.html">Youth Leadership School</a>.  This school, which I have conducted in various forms since 1968, provides the "nuts and bolts" technology needed to succeed in politics at all levels.<p>
-->
Many of today's leaders, including Senator Mitch McConnell, Governor Terry Branstad, Congressmen Jack Fields, Steve Stockman, Mark Souder, David McIntosh, and Virginia Attorney General Jim Gilmore, used the leadership Institute to launch their careers.<p>
Now it's your turn.<p>
The <a href="school.html">Student Publications School</a>, trains conservative students to start and run successful campus publications.  Attending this school will allow you to provide a forum for conservative views on your campus and gain valuable journalism experience as you fight the liberal monopoly of the college media.<p>
If you're graduating or have already begun a public policy career, I have several other programs that will interest you.  This Web site, will introduce you to  my <a href="sc-brj.html">Broadcast Journalism School</a>, <a href="sc-ch.html>Capitol Hill Staff Training School</a>, Foreign Service Opportunity School, <a href="sc-cd.html>Candidate Development School</a> and <a href="sc-pr.html">Public Relations School</a>.<p>
Your interest in public policy may take you far.  Please let me help you as you invest your time and effort in America's future.<p>
Thank you for considering what the Leadership Institute can offer you.  Listed below are brief descriptions of many of the Institute's programs.<p>
These programs are all made possibe by the generous support of the LI's donors.  The revenue from school tuition accounts for a tiny percentage of the total cost of the Institute's efforts.<p>
If you would like to help advance the work of the Institute via a <a href="donate.html.cgi">contribution,</a> you can do this on-line with your credit card or by mail to: The Leadership Institute, Steven P.J. Wood Building, 1101 Highland Street, Arlington, VA 22201.<p>
Please mark "Town Hall" in the memo field of your check.<p>
I look forward to hearing from you soon.<p>
Cordially,<p>
<img alt="mortsig" src="mortsig.gif">
<br>Morton C. Blackwell<br>
President<p>
<p>

P.S.  I've also put on-line here some of <a href="speeches.html">my speeches and writings</a> which I hope you find interesting.

</i>
<P>
Founded by Morton C. Blackwell in 1979, the Leadership Institute (LI) actively identifies,
recruits, trains and places principled conservatives in the public policy process.<p>

The Leadership Institute's Free Employment Placement Service is one of the oldest, longest
running, and most successful conservative job banks in Washington. LI's program has placed hundreds of conservatives
in all levels of the public policy process. In addition, its counseling service and educational programs
provide countless other conservatives with the leads, advice and training necessary to succeed in
public policy.<p>

Currently, LI's free Employment Placement Service offers three main placement options.<p>

The main Employment Placement Service program helps conservatives secure full and part-time
work in the public policy, government and private sectors.  A heavy emphasis is placed on filling
positions in Capitol Hill offices, special-interest groups and trade associations. After the 1994 fall election
cycle, special attention was given to Congressional placements and training of prospective Capitol Hill staff.

<p>The Broadcast Media Placement program helps conservatives locate and secure positions in
broadcast and print journalism, as well as public and media relations.<p>

The Intern Placement program helps interested individuals gain experience though
quality internships, volunteer work or temporary positions.<p>

Two full-time placement directors offer career counseling, tips on resume writing, job-hunting,
interviewing techniques, and networking advice to job-seekers.  To set-up an appointment, contact Emily Kertz at (703) 247-2000.<p>

In addition, LI offers a variety of one-day, two-day, three-day, and week-long professional
training programs to help conservatives become effective in the public policy process.<p>

Specialized schools such as the <a href="sc-ch.html">Capitol Hill Staff Training School</a>, the <a href="sc-cd.html">Candidate Development
School</a>, the Foreign Service Opportunity School, and the <a href="sc-brj.html">Broadcast Journalism School</a> teach job-
seekers how to land and succeed in positions within these professions.<p>


Technology-oriented schools including <!--the <a href="sc-yl.html">Youth Leadership School,--></a> the <a href="sc-pr.html">Public Relations

School,</a> the Rhetoric & Campaign Communications School, and
the <a href="sc-sp.html">Student Publications School</a> help conservatives enhance their public policy skills.<p>

<i>"Although I had been told by three separate individuals that the Leadership Institute is a good place to go when looking for a job, I never expected to see results so quickly. I would not have known where to start without your help. It was great to be on the receiving end of the  phone line for a change."</i><br>

<p>
The mission of the Salvatori Leadership Speakers Bureau is to promote on campus America's first principles and to defend the values of the Founding Fathers: the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, strong national defense and traditional family values.<p>

Although these speakers would not agree on all issues, each of them represents aspects of the winning conservative coalition in the United States, values and ideas which are over looked on most campuses.<p>
<p>
Currently, we are in the process of updating
our Salvatori Leadership Speakers Bureau web page. All of the speaker descriptions are being updated and new speakers are being added. The new web page will be
posted as soon as the updates are finished. If you would like information on

<h3>Morton C. Blackwell's<br>
Speeches and Writings</center></h3>
<p>

	From being the youngest Goldwater delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1964 to serving on the White House Staff for President Reagan, I have been involved in many aspects of the conservative movement.
<p>
	Over the years, I have written down many of my thoughts concerning conservative politics.
<P>
	I have compiled them and published them here so you may read them.  Feel free to read them on-line or even download them to read later.
<P>
	I would appreciate any <a href="mailto:mcb@townhall.com">comments</a> you have.  And if you would like to <a href="donate.html.cgi">support</a> the work of the Leadership Institute, thank you for your tax-deductible contribution.<p>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he alienation of African-American men from the churches of their communities 
is perhaps the single greatest tragedy facing black America. "While 75 percent of the 
mosque is male, 75 percent of the black church is female," laments Jawanza Kunjufu, 
author of <I>Adam Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church</I>. It wasn't 
always so: In earlier generations, black men were much more involved in the church, and 
their religious faith bolstered their commitment to families and neighborhoods. The most 
effective way to reduce black crime, and to strengthen black families, may be to return 
African-American men to their spiritual roots.</P>
<P>	A church in Baltimore that is itself returning to its roots is making great headway 
in its ministry to men. Bethel AME Church, founded in 1785, is the second-oldest church 
in the African Methodist Episcopal denomination and a venerable institution squarely in 
the black political mainstream. Bethel hosted much of the NAACP's national summit last 
year. Its pastor, Frank Madison Reid III, is the son and grandson of AME bishops, and his 
step-brother is Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Reid was educated at Yale University 
and Harvard Divinity School. A veteran of the civil-rights movement, he served later as 
pastor of Ward AME Church, an important congregation in Los Angeles. He has earned a 
black belt in karate, a prominent image as a local television personality, and a position as 
an intellectual leader of the African-American church.</P>

<H3>A Growing Concern</H3>
<P>	When Reid, 43, was named pastor of Bethel in 1989, the congregation had 7,000 
members, 25 percent of them men. Today, its membership numbers 10,000, 40 percent of 
whom are men. Each week, 4,400 of the faithful attend one of the two Sunday services, 
and 45 percent of them are men. Secular agencies and politicians who want to improve 
urban life should take note of Reid's ministry. Black men in his congregation have 
reconciled with their wives, resumed responsibilities to their children and communities, 
committed themselves to becoming productive citizens, and dedicated themselves to God.</P>
<P>	Rare among traditional black churches, economic classes mix at Bethel. The 
church is located in the Druid Hill section of Baltimore, a historically working-class 
neighborhood now infested with drugs and dilapidated public-housing projects, but it 
draws its membership from middle-class suburbs as well as the surrounding 
neighborhood. At services, blue-jean-clad youths pray while holding hands with middle-
aged professionals and families dressed in their Sunday best.</P> 
<P>	Reid attributes the growth of his congregation to a return to its Methodist roots. 
The Methodist movement, started by Charles and John Wesley in England in the 18th 
century, was spread throughout America by preachers such as George Whitefield. When 
Richard Allen and other blacks were barred from praying in a Methodist church in 
Philadelphia in the late 1700s, they established the AME church. Early Methodism 
emphasized moral rectitude and discipline, revivalism, the study of Scripture in Bible 
groups, and personal conversion. The movement played a leading role in the national 
crusades against drunkenness and slavery. "We meet the spiritual needs of the people 
because of our focus on prayer and the mystical nature of connection between the 
individual human being and the Holy Spirit," says Reid.</P>
<P>	Worship at Bethel is boisterous; dancing and shouting infuse the atmosphere. 
Reid sees this as a return to the spirit of early Methodism, when religious intensity 
energized powerful campaigns for the betterment of society. Reid points with pride to the 
18th-century English Methodists who "went into the prisons and streets with a revival 
that saved England from the same revolutionary fate as France." And he cites as a model 
the 1870s revival at Philadelphia's Bethel AME Church, which prompted a moral uplift 
in the city's black population.</P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men is in the early Methodist tradition of vigorous outreach to 
the unchurched, wherever they may be found. As the pastor of Ward AME in the early 
1980s, Reid concluded that the church wasn't addressing the needs of young men on the 
street. He also wondered why black males were joining the Nation of Islam or Los 
Angeles gangs like the Bloods and Crips, but not the Protestant churches. "Jesus said, `I 
will make you fishers of men,' " he says. "But either the church wasn't using the right 
bait or the lines weren't strong enough to bring the fish into the church."</P> 
<P>	How does Reid reel the men in at Bethel?  His television services encourage men 
to visit the church.  Highly approachable, he invites men to attend his church when he 
meets them on Baltimore's streets in his daily travels.  His use of the term "brother" 
suggests kinship and inspires male members to actively urge their friends to accompany 
them to Bethel.</P>  
<P>	Reid also uses a four-step plan that relies on "respect" for black males, teaching 
the "roots" of Christianity, "reformation" of habits, and "resurrection" of lives.  At 
Sunday services, male visitors are welcomed with applause and hugs. "We want to 
express our joy for your presence in the Lord's house," Reid says from the pulpit.</P>   
<P>	 Reid recently invited Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to speak at Bethel. 
Reid disagrees with Farrakhan's theology and racial and religious separatism. But Reid 
wanted men who are attracted to Farrakhan to be exposed to a church that emphasizes 
Christian manliness.</P>
<P>	Men who visit Bethel also find an atmosphere that is masculine as well as 
feminine, unlike many of the churches they are used to. At age 13 or so, many black 
youths tend to drop out of church. "At that age, black males who were once drawn to the 
choir as youth no longer sing, because robes look like dresses," says Reid. "Their Sunday 
school teacher, superintendent, and youth adviser are women. Their reaction to the 
religious femininity of the church drives them out of the church and into the seduction of 
a gang."</P>
<P>	At Bethel, men as well as women occupy important board and teaching positions, 
and Reid makes sure that men won't have to leave the church to find opportunities for 
brotherhood. In addition to all-female Bible study and family Bible programs, Bethel 
offers weekly all-male Bible classes. There, stories from Scripture inspire men to talk 
freely about difficulties in their relations with women, and--Reid calls this a common 
problem among black men--the resentment they may feel toward absent, domineering, or 
abusive fathers.</P> 
<P>	Every November, Bethel hosts a month-long celebration of men. Last year's 
activities included a retreat, African martial-arts experts, scholarly lectures, a Men's Day 
with noted personalities like talk-show host Tony Brown, and a week-long revival service 
at which 67 men, including some substance abusers, joined the church. </P>
<P>	Reid also attracts men to Bethel by setting strict standards of individual moral 
responsibility. Foul language, lying, cheating, and adultery are simply not tolerated. No 
drinking, smoking, or blasphemy is allowed in the congregation. In his sermons, Reid 
cautions the men against excessive anger, spitefulness, and abusive behavior created by 
high stress and low self-esteem. He advises them to restrain their anger through a close 
relationship with Christ. "If men are unable to handle their emotions," he says, "then they 
become prime candidates for abusing their wives or girlfriends and children, as well as 
their friends and neighbors and, ultimately, the community."</P>
<P>	Reid is convinced that exacting standards of behavior do not drive men away, but 
attract them. Men are empowered by morality, he says; they gain courage and conviction 
when they know they are acting responsibly. He argues that the appeal of Malcolm X and 
Louis Farrakhan comes more from their moral authority than their religion. Christianity, 
too, must emphasize its firmness along with its love and compassion. "Jesus drew strong 
fishermen to him," Reid says. "His moral authority was a magnet."</P>
<P>	Reid challenges the males in his congregation to be men rather than boys. "You 
can be 65 and still be a boy," he preaches. "You can be 45, married with children, and 
still be a boy. The difference between a boy and a man is that a man loves God and takes 
responsibility for himself and others."</P> 
<P>	Many congregants fail to live up to the church's standards. But all men are 
welcome. No stigma is placed on former convicts and drug-abusers. At each service, Reid 
asks men who have been incarcerated to stand and be applauded. Reid preaches that 
everybody in the church is sinful, citing the biblical injunction, "We were born in sin and 
shaped in iniquity, and we all have fallen short of the glory of God." </P>
<P>	Bethel provides wrongdoers with encouragement coupled with discipline. Biblical 
passages are cited to show why the behavior in question is wrong. The church is firm in 
response to wrongful deeds, but forgiving. The man admits his error, and he and Reid 
discuss ways to make restitution and bring healing for the wrongs he has committed. Reid 
strongly emphasizes restitution, arguing that one has a responsibility to bring wholeness 
to that which one has broken.</P>
<P>	Changa Onyanga used to be a lieutenant in the drug culture. When he first entered 
Bethel to visit a former member of his gang, he had no respect for ministers like Reid. "I 
looked him up and down and pressed on." Onyanga says now. "I did not speak to him. 
Besides, preachers had a bad rap because they were not doing anything for people who 
needed a cause to champion."</P>
<P>	Reid noted Onyanga's "terrible disposition" and responded. "No one walks 
around this church and does not speak," Reid said to him. "We are friendly and we speak 
to one another as Christians should." Reid had Onyanga's friend talk to him and teach 
him about the decorum of his church. Onyanga has since joined Bethel.</P>
<P>	In preaching personal responsibility, Reid acknowledges his own errors. Happily 
married with two daughters, eight and two, Reid also fathered a son out of wedlock 
during an earlier pastorate in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I do not deny my 15-year-old 
son," says Reid. "He is a reality." Although his son lives with the mother, Reid remains a 
significant part of his life. He provides monetary and moral support and communicates 
regularly. Reid even has him stand up in the congregation when he comes to visit.</P>
<P>	Reid tells the men that he has been where some of them are. Once they see that 
their spiritual leader is not above temptation, he believes, the men in his congregation can 
grapple more easily with issues of manhood and sexuality. </P>
<P>	Reid argues that spiritual leaders must be honest with men about their own 
failings. Some black men resist attending church because they regard the preachers as 
hypocrites. Reid chides his fellow clergy for not practicing what they preach. "Just 
because they received the calling," he says, "does not mean they are above the struggle or 
the contradictions." Citing St. Augustine and other great religious teachers who have 
acknowledged their sinfulness, he says pastors must realize they are preaching to 
themselves as well as to their congregations. </P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men includes working with women to restore male authority in 
the home. Men will be better fathers and husbands and will participate more willingly in 
church and community life, Reid argues, if they are allowed to exercise authority as head 
of the household. This does not mean tyranny or dictatorial control, but rather loving 
responsibility. Reid teaches men to be the protector, priest, provider, and partner of the 
household. The Old Testament instructs the man to be "watchman for his family."</P>
<P>	"We teach that the man should be the first person his wife goes to for prayer," 
Reid says. "If there is need for the pastor to come into the household, then it should be to 
pray for the family. But that can only happen if the man takes the leadership in making 
prayer a part of the household. The man should take the leadership for making sure Bible 
study is part of family life." Reid preaches that wives should submit to their husbands, 
but also that husbands must not abuse this authority. "Paul's letter to the Ephesians 
teaches us: `Woman, submit thyself if your man loves you as Jesus loves the church,' "  
he says. "If the husband does not love his wife as Jesus loved the church, then she has no 
responsibility to submit to him. We submit to Jesus out of the fact that he loved us." </P>
<P>	The principle of male headship does not mean that the husband must be the 
primary breadwinner. "We teach the men that wives' earnings should not bruise their 
ego," says Reid. "A husband should be thankful when a woman who earns more, or has 
more education, looks to him as protector and provider." The word "provider," Reid 
points out, comes from the Latin for "seeing." It means supplying a family's vision as 
much as providing its material sustenance.</P>
<P>	Reid also teaches women how to respond to men in the household. Annette 
Brown, for example, used Reid's sermon on "a loving God" to endure six years of 
estrangement from her husband, Kevin. "There were times when my husband was gone 
for four days without contact," says Brown, "but pastor Reid's message told me to look 
beyond his faults and see his needs." Annette and Kevin are back together, and their 
relationship is stronger. He has joined Bethel and resumed his role as father of their two 
sons. He has even begun to prepare for the ministry.</P>
<P>	Brown is the religious leader and disciplinarian of the household. He is also in 
charge of sex education. Brown settles family decisions after family prayer. Matters in 
which he reserves the final say include private school for their children, vacations, family 
transportation, his work hours, visits to relatives, and house-buying. But his wife controls 
the household finances. She submits to him because he submits to the church. "Kevin 
takes the authority in the household," she says. "When there is a decision, he makes the 
final decision." She reserves the right to veto any decision not in the family's best 
interest, but she adheres to Biblical scripture: Better to live on a corner of the roof than 
share a house with a quarrelsome wife. "I always uplift my husband," she says.</P>
<P>	Reid denies that this approach oppresses women. "I have not talked to a single 
African-American woman," he says, "who has said `no' when I have asked whether she 
would gladly submit to a man who loved Christ, who provided for her and her children, 
who would protect her, and was spiritual. They recognize that the submission would not 
be an oppressive submission, but a submission in partnership." </P>
<P>	Reid encourages men to marry or, if they are separated, to reunite with the 
mothers of their children. But he does not always counsel marriage. "It makes no sense," 
he says, "to push together a couple that does not love each other. If the mother has 
become pregnant for the wrong reasons--out of lust, for example, or to get welfare 
payments--then it may not be possible for the father to exercise loving authority as head 
of the household."</P>
<P>	"In an ideal world, it is easy to say, `if you make a baby, then marry the mother,' " 
Reid says. "But as a pastor, I have to deal with the hard facts of family conflict. What 
happens to the child who grows up in a home where the parents hate each other because 
you made them get married? The child will grow up with their hostility and take it out 
into the world."</P> 
<P>	Reid thinks public policy treats African-American men with illegitimate children 
too harshly. He is especially troubled by a court system that cuts fathers off from their 
children. Men are presumed guilty in disputes over child support; visitation can be denied 
at the mother's request. Reid says the system "tortures fathers, who often want to do the 
right thing for their children, and is unfairly slanted toward the mother."</P>
<P>	According to Reid, models of Christian manhood from African and African-
American history are essential in attracting black men to church. Before becoming full 
members of Bethel, men must spend an hour with the pastor, who teaches them about 
Africans in the Bible and African-American church history. In this portion of his 
ministry, which he calls "roots," Reid tries to dispel the notion that Christianity is a 
Eurocentric, slave masters' religion. He teaches about the Africans Simeon (also called 
Niger) and Lucius of Cyrene, who ordained the Apostle Paul and Silas. He talks about the 
black abolitionist David Walker, who in 1829 published an anti-slavery tract known as 
the Appeal. This seminal publication demanded the end of slavery and appealed to the 
"God of the Ethiopians." </P> 
<P>	Another of Reid's models of black Christian manhood is Bishop Henry McNeil 
Turner. Born a slave in South Carolina, Turner became the first black chaplain of the 
Union army, a member of the South Carolina Legislature, and an advocate for the black 
emigration to Africa in 1874. His status as a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church allowed him to carry the African-American religious tradition to South Africa 
more than 100 years ago. </P> 
<P>	Reid also likes to point out to his African-American audience that Jesus may not 
have been as European-looking as Hollywood and other forms of  popular culture 
typically have portrayed him--white, blue-eyed, and fair-haired. He quotes a passage 
from the Old Testament book of Daniel that describes the Messiah, whose "feet were like 
burnished brass and his hair was like lamb's wool," and the New Testament book of 
Revelation, which similarly describes Jesus with feet "like bronze glowing in a furnace." 
Some church members, such as Charles Wiggins, say they were greatly affected by 
Reid's more raw, human portrait of Christ. "I had never heard a minister talk about Jesus 
who looked like me," says Wiggins, who joined in 1991. "I have found a home."</P>
<P>	Reid brings in guest lecturers to talk about African-American manhood. In a 
recent program, Na'im Akbar, a Florida State psychologist who is an expert on black 
male psychology, urged men at Bethel to learn from "the courage of Dr. King, the 
defiance of the honorable Elijah Muhammed, the economic strategy of Booker T. 
Washington, and the uncompromising integrity of Paul Robeson."</P>
<P>	Reid encourages the men to spiritually mold young males of the community. 
Through Project RAISE, they mentor teenagers from local schools. The men do not 
pressure them to join the church, but some do, attending Sunday services and Bible study 
with their mentors.</P>
<P>	After a small riot erupted at Booker T. Washington Junior High School just before 
Christmas last year, Bethel began a direct partnership with the school. To prevent a 
reoccurrence, Reid summoned 150 men to the school. They lined the street in front of the 
school and remained watchful for arsonists, gangs, and visiting troublemakers. At the 
request of the principal, the men recently returned to supervise the children in the 
morning and afternoon. The pupils' tranquillity prompted one teacher to comment that 
they were "acting like children again."</P>
<P>	Bethel assists men in running their households. In the class for new members, 
men are shown how to allocate their earnings. The 10-10-80 plan is a voluntary financial-
management procedure wherein 10 percent of the new member's yearly earnings is 
contributed to the church. Another 10 percent goes into a savings account, while the 
remainder is used for living expenses. </P>
<P>	Men who need additional help in managing their finances can attend classes on 
preparing tax returns, taught by a CPA who donates her time. Bethel has helped its 
members form food co-ops and investment clubs for pooling risk capital, purchasing 
bonds and mutual funds, and setting up funds for children's college tuition.</P>
<P>	Reid and members of the congregation also find jobs for men. Some have 
convictions for crack use, weapons possession, or other felonies, while others possess 
little or no high school or college education. But Reid and other officers at Bethel often 
vouch for the character of church members who might not look good on paper.</P>
<P>	Reid himself hires men as security guards for the church. The security team not 
only protects the church and its membership; it gives young men the opportunity to 
"soldier"--to wear a uniform, carry walkie-talkies, use one's physical strength, and 
become close friends with other men. Reid argues that these are the principal lures of 
being in a gang. So why not channel these male yearnings into structures that help build 
spiritual soldiers?</P>
<P>	The security guards are called the Mighty Men of God after the warriors who 
followed King David.  There is no better symbol than these men of Reid's teaching that 
Christianity is a manly as well as a womanly religion. The Mighty Men of God hold 
respected positions in the church, including the leader of Bible study, sexton, and security 
guard. They are responsible for the safety of the congregation and community, and 
combat random crime with periodic community patrolling. </P>
<P>	The M.M.O.G. play an important role in the safety of the children who attend 
Bethel's day school. They greet parents and students each morning as they arrive. During 
the day, they guard against intruders and drug sales. At the end of the day, a Mighty Man 
of God sees each child safely across the street.</P>
<P>	The regimen of the M.M.O.G. requires discipline. They meet for two hours every 
Tuesday and Saturday. Officers open the meetings with a personal inspection. They 
check for fresh haircuts, cleanshaven faces, and shined shoes. Members are not allowed 
to smoke or drink, so officers check for burns and yellow stains from nicotine or 
marijuana. M.M.O.G. maintain two uniforms: a suit and a security outfit for guarding the 
church.</P>
<P>	After prayer, they discuss local and international events. Drilling, marching, and 
commands soon fill the room. An inspirational message from Reid follows, and the group 
closes with hand-holding prayer.</P>
<P>	One member of the Mighty Men of God is Max Taylor. After joining Bethel at the 
age of 18, Taylor joined forces with local drug dealers and descended into the world of 
drugs, guns, and violence. He was responsible for preparing street corners for potential 
drug sales. "I cleaned street corners for drug dealers by any means necessary," says 
Taylor, 29. He reached a point, he says, when he realized that if he continued he would 
soon "be dead or behind bars for a long time if I was arrested."</P>
<P>	In 1992, Taylor rejoined the church with rejuvenated purpose. He walked through 
local housing complexes challenging drug dealers, his old friends, for territory. "I was 
extremely cold and ruthless," says Taylor, "but due to the power of Frank Reid and God, 
I have changed."</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT></B>peaking in Galesburg, Illinois, in January, President Clinton proposed a federally 
funded job-training program "to keep the American Dream alive in the 21st century." 
Cost to American taxpayers: $3.5 billion a year.</P>
<P>	If he had driven about an hour north, Clinton could have visited a college campus 
that proves his program is unnecessary. DeVry Institute of Technology, headquartered in 
Oakbrook, Illinois, makes a handsome profit by offering a first-rate technical education to 
working-class students. This little-known school shows how private businesses 
outperform government in providing good job training.</P>
<P>	On 13 campuses from Atlanta to Los Angeles, more than 15,000 students--35 
percent of whom are black or Latino--are earning their bachelor's of science degrees at 
DeVry. Ninety-four percent of the school's graduates land jobs in their fields of study 
within six months, with an average starting salary exceeding $24,000 a year.</P>
<P>	DeVry's alumni enjoy cutting-edge technical careers. At Hughes 
Communications, the nation's largest satellite company, 22 of the 30 engineers 
responsible for orbit maintenance are DeVry graduates. KLA Instruments, which designs 
quality-control systems for the manufacture of microchips, boasts that a fifth of its 1,000 
employees graduated from DeVry. All this at an annual cost per student of $2,500 less 
than similar state-run programs.</P>
<P>	And DeVry posted a $12-million profit on revenues of  $211 million last year to 
boot.</P>

<H3>Selling Job Opportunity</H3>
<P>	Since its founding in 1931 by Herman DeVry, the inventor of the portable 
motion-picture projector, the institute has specialized in technical training that leads to 
lucrative careers. DeVry, which grants accredited bachelor's degrees, is a for-profit 
venture whose stock trades on the NASDAQ exchange. In short, it sells job opportunity.</P>
<P>	Five years ago, when Zaneta Rizzo graduated from a small high school in rural 
Louisiana, she "knew less than nothing" about computers, thought DOS was pronounced 
"dose," and was terrified of automatic-teller machines.</P>
<P>	After two years of bouncing among jobs in fast-food restaurants, Rizzo enrolled at 
DeVry's Dallas campus. Recently she graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer 
information systems and is deciding between several job offers with computer-training 
firms. Before DeVry, Rizzo's salary peaked at $760 a month. Her current offers are for 
$25,000 a year--a 275 percent pay hike.</P>
<P>	When Jeri Gomez graduated from high school near Fresno, California, she 
enrolled in a local community college to study the health sciences and dance, but classes 
were constantly being canceled, so she enlisted in the army. After serving in Desert 
Storm, Gomez enrolled at DeVry's Pomona campus. She is now deciding among several 
job offers in software programming that pay more than $30,000 a year.</P>
<P>	Rizzo's and Gomez's stories are typical of DeVry students, many of whom field 
multiple job offers before their commencement. In fact, more than 95 percent of 
engineering and accounting majors are placed in their fields within six months of 
graduation--a success rate many of the nation's top schools never approach. How does 
DeVry do it? By running the college like a business.</P>
<P>	Unlike most colleges, DeVry receives no direct government money or alumni 
gifts. Nearly all revenues, and therefore profits, come from tuition. And DeVry has found 
that the best way to attract more students--over half of whom are the first in their 
families to attend college--is to secure high-paying jobs for graduates. Dennis Keller, 
DeVry's chief executive officer, says the school avoids anything that doesn't help 
students find careers.</P>
<P>	To this end, DeVry maintains an enormous placement system with more than 100 
staffers and a database of thousands of employers. While most other schools in the 
country assign placement officers to handle a broad spectrum of careers, DeVry has 
found that employers prefer to communicate with staffers who understand their particular 
needs. For this reason, each officer is trained in a specific field. For instance, Motorola--
which is based near DeVry's DuPage County campus in northern Illinois--works closely 
with staffers specializing in telecommunications. The payoff has been tremendous. When 
the electronics giant was planning a major expansion in Illinois, it consulted DeVry 
placement officials in advance to secure an educated labor force.</P>
<P>	DeVry also edges out the competition by studying labor trends, nationally as well 
as in the local markets near each campus. DeVry does not depend on the federal 
government's research, which is mostly retrospective; its researchers analyze new and 
growing fields. Using data from interviews with small and large employers, annual 
alumni surveys, and more than a dozen local-industry advisory panels, DeVry graduates 
can target rapidly emerging areas that traditional schools miss. Relying on data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, most colleges until recently paid little attention to 
the cellular industry. DeVry officials, on the other hand, adjusted their 
telecommunications curriculum eight years ago to include this technology, and 
subsequently launched the careers of many graduates. "Health care is the next big one," 
says Norman Metz, a senior vice president at DeVry. "We are currently focusing on the 
medical-equipment industry that will handle the graying of America."</P>
<P>	Despite these unsurpassed placement results, the Clinton administration has 
frowned upon for-profit schools like DeVry, insisting the capitalist model leads to a 
useless education. At a 1993 press conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich told 
journalists to be wary of these institutions, claiming that they mismatch thousands of 
students, and that there is no market for their degrees. Reich's warning was reiterated by 
the media, including the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which urged some for-profit schools to 
carry "warning labels" detailing prospective students' chances of finding employment 
after graduation. In fact, if many state schools had to publish such information, students 
would likely flock to DeVry.</P>

<H3>Blood, Sweat, and Jobs</H3>
<P>	Some for-profit trade schools, to be sure, are little more than diploma mills that 
give gullible students a shlock education. These schools usually go bankrupt when 
students catch on that their degree leads nowhere. But for an institution that is in business 
for the long haul, producing high-quality education for satisfied customers is essential to 
growth and profitability. Keller believes that every graduate represents the school: If an 
employer is unsatisfied with the quality of a single graduate's work, he is unlikely to hire 
from DeVry in the future. That would ultimately harm the bottom line.</P>
<P>	To that end, the school maintains a demanding curriculum that students call 
"brutal" and Keller calls "tough love." It is a no-frills, lots-of-sweat education. The 
rigorous process begins even before the classes start. Although the school accepts SAT 
and ACT test scores--applicants average at the 45th percentile--all students are required 
to take DeVry's admissions test in math. About 14 percent of the applicants fail the exam. 
Of the remaining students, about a quarter are admitted on the condition that they take 
remedial classes. Applicants are also required to take a College Board English test that 
determines their placement in humanities courses.</P>
<P>	From the first day, students follow the curriculum in lockstep. There are no 
electives. Students immediately choose a major from among five fields: electronics-
engineering technology, computer information systems, business operations, 
telecommunications management, or accounting. Each major requires eight or nine 
semesters, and can be completed in three years with summer school.</P>
<P>	Students and DeVry's senior management both prefer this inflexible system. Like 
a manufacturer, the school desires a reputation for providing a consistent "product"; 
students say they enjoy receiving firm direction. "This gets rid of a lot of the time-
wasting filler classes, like underwater basket-weaving, that people take elsewhere," 
recalls Rose Huening, a 1986 graduate.</P>

<H3>Heavy Lifting</H3>
<P>	Here there is no time to waste. Each term, DeVry students take at least four 
classes, plus labs, often exceeding a conventional courseload by four to six credit hours. 
The first-year courseload for computer information systems is typical: five computer-
science classes, four computer labs, two math courses and a math lab, two English 
courses with one writing lab, an economics course, a psychology course, and a business 
course. In addition, since many of the students have never before been pushed to work so 
hard, all freshmen enroll in a class on "success strategies," which teaches study skills and 
time-management techniques.</P>
<P>	George Dean, the vice president for educational planning, believes that many 
traditional colleges waste a great deal of energy embracing new teaching methods. DeVry 
doesn't mandate teaching methods--professors can choose whatever textbooks they 
want--but the level of academic expectations is set at the head office, and it's set high. 
"At the end of the course, the students have to be able to do x and y and z," Dean says. 
"If it works better at the Columbus campus to teach it z then y then x, it doesn't bother 
me."</P>
<P>	Dean is comfortable giving the professors ample latitude because they are 
required to gain real-world experience in their field, and so tend to prefer the most 
practical methods. Although some students earn money for tuition by assisting faculty 
members, they are prohibited from teaching, and are usually limited to grading papers.</P>
<P>	Unlike trade schools that teach specific skills (many of which become obsolete as 
technology changes), DeVry's curriculum focuses on teaching students how to reason. In 
many ways, DeVry offers the liberal-arts version of a technical education: students learn 
how to solve technical problems. They are drilled thoroughly on the basics, and required 
to spend countless hours in the lab to build an educational foundation. On exams, 
students are rarely asked straight-forward mathematical questions; instead, they are 
usually given detailed descriptions of real-world problems, including information they 
must recognize as extraneous. Dean claims that this education prepares students to 
operate efficiently in the business world. Furthermore, teachers will fail students whose 
lab reports are not written in proper English, regardless of the experiment's outcome. 
DeVry doesn't shortchange the humanities, because these non-technical abilities will be 
vital to the students' careers. Alumni routinely tell Dean that the technical skills get them 
hired and the reasoning skills get them promoted.</P>
<P>	 A student with a grade point average below a "C" is placed on academic 
probation, and prohibited from taking a relaxed schedule. If the student's g.p.a. remains 
below a "C" average the following semester, he or she is expelled. Every year, 20 percent 
of the student body flunks out. DeVry does not pamper its students en route to the 
diploma. "We have hard classes, but if that is not met with enough commitment to be 
successful, then it is detrimental to this company for that student to stay," Keller says. 
Huening's class is a perfect example: of the 325 students who started, only 94 graduated 
on time.</P> 
<P>	Just as auto manufacturers are constantly reviewing the efficiency of their cars, 
DeVry maintains strict quality control. About a decade ago, DeVry was reviewing each 
course every three years, which was considered swift compared to traditional schools. 
Now it rewrites each course at least once a year. During the summer term, faculty 
members visit hundreds of employers across the nation and find out what their needs will 
be in five to 10 years. Together with information offered by industry leaders on DeVry's 
dozen or so curriculum-advisory boards, the school sets new course requirements. For 
instance, a few years ago most computer-programming courses only taught a 
programming language called COBOL, but professors noted that firms near some of their 
campuses were switching from mainframes to desktop-based systems that require C 
language. After DeVry adjusted its curriculum, businesses responded by hiring more of 
its graduates. Although industry does not dictate DeVry's curriculum, the school must 
measure success and failure by its placement rate.</P>
<P>	The institute's educational audit is exhaustive. DeVry's central headquarters 
evaluates randomly selected writing samples from students on every campus twice a year 
in order to ensure that writing skills remain high. The institute also administers 
standardized tests in electronics to be certain that technical skills are not dropping. 
Finally, administrators also investigate courses with unusual grade distribution.</P>
<P>	The best evidence of the quality of DeVry's curriculum is the on-the-job success 
of its graduates. Bill Buglewicz, a senior manufacturing manager at KLA Instruments, 
recruits at six of the campuses every year. "DeVry students have a great work ethic, 
higher motivation, and initiative," Buglewicz says. "The courseload, in particular the 
exhaustive lab work, makes them wonderful thinkers and troubleshooters."</P> 
<P>	Gary Nuzzi, a 1983 graduate, says the lab work helped him and 1963 graduate 
Bill Blethen develop a revolutionary lighting system that won an Academy Award for 
technical achievement last year. The portable strobe light allows movie cameras to 
capture detail at high speed. "The education was, at times, very challenging, but very 
practical," Nuzzi adds.</P> 

<H3>The Bottom Line</H3>
<P>	Most remarkable, however, is that DeVry makes a profit. By defining its mission 
narrowly, the school has perfected its product and minimized waste. DeVry's cost-saving 
efforts are immediately evident. There are no ivy-laden academic halls or rolling greens. 
Rather, each DeVry campus holds its classes in an office building that is usually 
surrounded by a parking lot. In such a modern facility, little space is wasted, maintenance 
costs are moderate, and classrooms can accommodate professors from various 
departments. And the school runs three cycles of classes--morning, afternoon, and 
evening--to use the space more efficiently. The institute does not own any dormitories. 
Instead, DeVry leases housing near its campuses from local landlords and sublets it to the 
students at a modest profit.</P>
<P>	DeVry also holds down costs by maintaining a narrow academic focus. DeVry 
does not fund any sports teams or clubs that are not directly related to job placement; on 
some campuses, students independently run intramural leagues by securing outside 
sponsors. "We are not trying to be all things to all people," says Kathy Perdue, head of 
the accounting department at the Atlanta campus. "We figured out what we do best, 
concentrating on the academics to get jobs, not filling social needs."</P>
<P>	The school does not grant tenure to any of its professors, allowing it to respond 
quickly to fluctuating enrollments. Moreover, DeVry is not a research or publishing 
institution, so faculty members carry teaching loads two to three times that of other 
college professors. Finally, since the school operates at full capacity, even in the 
summers, professors are expected to work as they would in private industry: year-round.
<P>	DeVry maximizes tuition revenue by actively recruiting students through 
television and newspaper advertising, direct mail, and recruiters. A traveling sales force 
of 200 visits high schools and Army bases throughout North America, while another 100 
salespeople respond to applicants who call DeVry in response to advertising. DeVry's 
$15-million advertising campaign promotes its focus on careers, profiling graduates with 
senior positions in prominent companies like Coca-Cola.</P>
<P>	The individual cost-saving measures add up. The price tag of a DeVry education 
is $6,015 for two semesters, or $26,730 for the complete degree. By comparison, a four-
year degree at public, non-research universities in the same states where DeVry operates 
costs much more in tuition and taxpayer subsidies: $40,148 in California, for instance, 
and $35,440 in Georgia.</P>
<P>	As an accredited school, DeVry participates in all the same financial aid programs 
as public schools. DeVry's loan default rate is 17 percent--better than many for-profit 
trade schools and far below the government's intervention zone of 25 to 30 percent. 
Industry analysts note that the institute's job placement record and bachelor's degree 
program distinguishes it from trade schools.</P>
<P>	For-profit schools such as DeVry are a model for the future of university 
education. As more adults return to school later in life, they will find they prefer the no-
nonsense DeVry degree, which can be finished in three years. Currently the average age 
of DeVry students is 26. In addition, the number of high-school graduates is expected to 
keep rising through 2013. Combine that statistic with downsizing in the military, for-
profit education's top rival for high-school graduates, and DeVry seems to enjoy a rosy 
outlook. In fact, the results are already beginning to show: Enrollment was up 4 percent 
this year, and the company added two new campuses. "Frankly, the demand is growing 
quicker than our ability to supply it," says Norman Levine, DeVry's chief financial 
officer. And two other for-profit college-education companies announced initial public 
offerings this year.</P>
<P>	Despite DeVry's proven track record in securing jobs for working-class students, 
bureaucrats may prevent the school from expanding. In New York City, for example, the 
state's department of education has not yet approved DeVry's 1993 accreditation 
application. Once the department okays the school's academic standards, government 
analysts will determine DeVry's impact on established local schools. Every college in 
New York City will be invited to comment on DeVry's entrance into the market. If area 
schools fear DeVry will steal students from their tuition rolls, they can urge the 
department to reject the application. The Education Department's Bureau of Planning will 
also analyze whether the local job market can accommodate the future DeVry graduates. 
Department officials note that, due to understaffing, it normally takes several years for a 
school's 300-page application to be approved.</P>
<P>	Even skeptics of for-profit education concede that public schools and private non-
profits are unable to expand to meet the growing demand. Public universities would 
require greater tax subsidies to support a larger student base, and private non-profits 
would have to raise even more through alumni giving. "Time and time again, we have 
seen that the healthiest and best systems in the world involve private enterprise 
competing," says Keller. "We're the future of education."</P>

<blockquote>

We must restore a balance between citizen and police responsibilities, [for] effective social control cannot possibly be achieved by hired hands alone.
</blockquote><p>

-- Herman Goldstein, <i>Policing a Free Society
</i><p>
	Americans live in fear. We live in the most criminally violent times in our nation's history. The level of street crime is between three and four times what it was in 1960, and the rate of violent crimes quadrupled between 1966 and 1990. People no longer feel safe walking to the corner store or letting their kids bike to the local park.
<p>	In healthy communities, individuals establish and enforce codes of conduct, both formal and informal. Litterers get a lecture. Speeders get yelled at. Unruly youths get a tongue-lashing. But in unhealthy communities, the fear of crime keeps people shut up in their homes (especially the elderly), cuts off commercial activity, alienates individuals from each other, and surrenders the streets to the very kind of disorderly activity that fuels crime in the first place. Community is eroded, and because individuals are afraid to maintain order, the community loses its lawful environment.
<p>	Until neighborhoods are safe again, they will not thrive economically or socially. Waiting for the government to make it all better is a losing strategy. People have to become more involved in ensuring their own security.
<p>	It is said that for every complex problem, there is a simple and elegant solution that is wrong. For crime, the simple answer is, "We need more cops and we need more prisons." Though extremely popular right now with politicians, this approach will ultimately do little to improve public safety. The best police force in the world cannot make safe a community in which people have no regard for the lives or property of others. Without question, swift and sure punishment of criminal activity is an important component of an effective crime policy. But the best defense against crime is not a thin, blue line, but a community of individuals respectful of others. 
<p>	There is a great deal that the government can and should do to improve public safety, but first it must recognize that it needs help. Restoring public safety demands a renewed partnership between the police and the community. Police must reacquaint themselves with the people in the communities they serve, and communities must recognize that the brunt of the task of policing a free society does not lie with the police, but with citizens themselves.
<p>
<b>Community Policing</b><p>
	From the time of America's founding, law enforcement has had a strong neighborhood foundation. In the early years of the Republic, male citizens in large U.S. cities were required to stand watch at night with no pay. Throughout most of America's history, in fact, citizens were expected to police their communities themselves -- at least part time -- as they went about their daily lives. The job of police officers was to support the community in keeping the peace.
<p>	Alexis de Tocqueville, who was particularly impressed by this, wrote, "In America, the means available to the authorities for the discovery of crimes and arrest of criminals are few. . . . Nevertheless, I doubt whether in any other country crime so seldom escapes punishment. . . . During my stay in the United States I have seen the inhabitants of a country where a serious crime had been committed spontaneously forming committees with the object of catching the criminal and handing him over to the courts. In Europe the criminal is a luckless man fighting to save his head from the authorities. In America he is an enemy of the human race and every human being is against him."
<p>	Direct community involvement doesn't mean vigilantes stringing up violators. Urban anthropologist Jane Jacobs explains, "The first thing to understand is that the public space -- the sidewalk and street peace -- of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. Rather, it is kept by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards established and enforced by the people themselves."
<p>	Except in extremely small geographic areas, it is not economically possible to put a cop on every corner. No police department is large enough -- nor should it be -- to serve as an occupying army. A community must police itself. There is no way that New York City's 37,000 police officers can control the city's 7.5 million residents. The police are there to help. For much of America's history, this was understood.
<p>	In the 1960s, however, the public began to forget its role in controlling crime and grew increasingly dependent on the police. Police departments became more professionalized and shifted their primary mission from peacekeeping to crime fighting. Rather than regular beats, foot patrols, and informal pressure on the unruly, police forces increasingly used motorized patrols, radio dispatch, and rapid response as their main tools. In the terminology of television culture, the "Andy of Mayberry" model was replaced by the "One-Adam-Twelve" approach. 
<p>	Americans began to think of crimefighting as the job of police. The riots of the 1960s showed in violent detail how America's historic partnership between police and community had broken down. Police officers -- often in squad cars or behind desks at headquarters -- were spending more time with other officers than with citizens. The new policing methods had the effect of divorcing them from the community. The divorce was mutual: Many communities stopped policing themselves. <p>
	This alienation left everyone worse off. Americans are more dissatisfied with their police departments than ever before, and the police are straining under the weight of massive problems they are powerless to handle alone. 
<p>	Swift and sure punishment for criminals is important, but we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that the courts can make us safe, any more than the police can. We will never really get a hold on crime in America until we move back to a society where kids in trouble can be turned around before they get in more trouble and are sent away to prisons to become hardened criminals. "The total impacts [of public policy on crime] are not going to be that great in a free society," says James Q. Wilson. "A free society depends on the conscience and reputations of individuals and the social norms of communities to maintain order. That is what has collapsed in America."
<p>	To use an analogy from the manufacturing world, we can't afford to depend on an outside referee to detect and fix the defective products of our society; far better to create a system that isn't producing so many defects in the first place. From this perspective, product quality is no longer the exclusive responsibility of the inspectors in the quality department; rather, it's everyone's concern. Families come first, police and courts follow.
<p>	With its emphasis on crime prevention, community policing can be a part of the total picture. "We currently see ourselves as feeding the criminal-justice system," says police chief Daryl Stephens of St. Petersburg, Florida. "What if we saw our primary responsibility as starving it?"
<P>	At its heart, neighborhood policing recreates the partnership between the police and the community. In essence, the police tell the community, "We will help you do your job." Variations of the idea are being introduced all over the country, from Jacksonville to Madison to Seattle.
<p>	For community policing to work, the neighborhoods have to be willing to help themselves. Explains San Diego police officer Jim Coleman, "It is not the teacher's fault, it's not the police officer's fault, it's not the court's fault. The community has to recognize it has a responsibility for governing its own value standards. . . . People choose the way they want to live, and police can't remove that responsibility. The police can't come in and restore order if the community doesn't raise its own value standard."
<p>	San Diego has led the nation in embracing a partnership with neighborhood groups, citizen patrols, and volunteer "officers" (see <a href="#sandiego">sidebar</a>). To be sure, in America's toughest communities, where neighborhood control has been overrun by gangs, drug dealers, and a general sense of lawlessness, community policing of the San Diego model may not be enough. Community policing works best in the communities still controlled by law-abiding residents, not criminals. In the neighborhoods where criminals now hold sway, cops will be needed to help law-abiding citizens -- a majority in even the worst inner-city neighborhoods -- regain control and come out from behind their locked doors to augment the police presence. In the long run, however, community members themselves must take responsibility for making their neighborhoods unfriendly to criminals.
<p>
<b>Street Patrols
</b><p>	A key component of community policing is getting more cops back on the neighborhood beat. "Beat integrity," the practice of charging a small group of officers with responsibility for a small area, has hardly been seen since the 1950s. Patrols can be conducted on foot, on bike, in a car, or some combination of these. The beat system increases the connection between law-abiding citizens and the police and gives citizens opportunities to express their concerns. 
<p>	This sense of connection is evident in the community policing of officer Mike Elder, whose beat for the last two years has been a three-square-mile, lower-middle-class area on Indianapolis's south side. Elder's beat includes numerous vacant lots, some boarded-up buildings, and two of the city's worst public-housing projects. As in many cities, Indianapolis's urban sprawl makes it impractical for Elder to patrol his entire beat on foot. However, he makes up for this by spending a good part of each day walking around the housing projects and the neighborhood parks, checking in with store owners, and maintaining open office hours at his field office in the Clearstream housing project.<p>
	Elder is a reassuring presence to public-housing residents tired of living in fear. Before Elder set up shop at Clearstream, says one resident, "there would be gunfights in the project in the middle of the street in broad daylight." Another Clearstream resident, a single mother, says, "Before Mike came in, I wouldn't dare let my kids play outdoors because of the shootings and drug deals going down at all hours of the day and night. People living in projects want a normal life, too -- and we're getting there." After Elder started his beat, the number of service calls from the Clearstream projects to the police dropped from 1,500 in 1991 to 550 in 1993.<p>
	With an intense awareness of the neighborhood, community-based officers can stop crimes before they happen. The officer on the beat hears gossip from casual, informal contact with people. Elder knows most of the residents at his two housing projects. He can count on a dozen or so residents in each project to keep him informed of impending trouble by calling him on his beeper. If any drug dealing is taking place or any strangers are causing trouble, he'll know within a day.
<p>	Assigning officers to regular beats and emphasizing problem-solving can also prompt residents of troubled minority areas to look more favorably on the men and women in blue. Before Elder was assigned to their beat, residents of Clearstream didn't much trust the police. Residents only saw cops when they were responding to incidents, and viewed them as outsiders. With steady contact, Elder has built a relationship of trust. "If we tried to take Elder out of that beat, the residents would be marching on city hall within hours," jokes Michael Beaver, Indianapolis's director of public safety.
<p>	Most cops loathe beat patrols. Many police officers -- particularly those in middle management -- would prefer the safety of their desk jobs over venturing out onto the streets. Hitting the pavement is seen as a demotion by veteran cops, many of whom have worked hard to get off the beat and win an assignment to a specialty unit or to administrative work. 
<p>	Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler learned the hard way that the opposition to community policing can be intense. When he was elected in 1992, just one cop worked foot patrol in Jersey City; Schundler wanted 300. The force hardly embraced the idea. "Comfortable jobs in all city departments were given as a reward for political service and loyalty," wrote Schundler in <i>Policy Review</i> (Summer 1994). "The patronage system has made assignments to street patrol intolerable."<p>
	The new mayor found himself battling with Jersey City's police union. When Schundler learned that two police officers spent their days delivering interoffice mail, he had them reassigned to street patrol. The police union filed a lawsuit to prevent the move, citing a contract clause that states: "Police work cannot be diminished except through contract negotiation." Like most people, Schundler can't understand how having officers patrol the street diminishes police work. He is fighting the suit.
<p>	Schundler cites union contracts -- supported by state arbitration rules -- as his biggest barrier to successful policing. "Our crime problem is not the result of our spending too little on policing," he says, "but rather of our getting too little policing for our money -- and the root cause of this problem is non-local government interference in police department management."
<p>
<b>Combating Disorder
</b>

<p>	Many urban areas are marked by evidence of physical decay: boarded-up buildings, vacant lots strewn with litter, and graffiti-covered walls. This sense of community despair creates an aura of lawlessness that encourages criminal behavior.
<p>	In a 1982 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> article titled "Broken Windows," James Q. Wilson and George Kelling argued that disorder in a community, if left uncorrected, undercuts residents' own efforts to maintain their homes and neighborhoods and control unruly behavior. "If a window in a building is broken and left unrepaired," they wrote, "all the rest of the windows will soon be broken. . . . One unrepaired window is a signal that no one cares, so breaking more windows costs nothing. . . . Untended property becomes fair game for people out for fun or plunder."
<p>	If disorder goes unchecked, a vicious cycle begins. First, it kindles a fear of crime among residents, who respond by staying behind locked doors. Their involvement in the neighborhood declines; people begin to ignore rowdy and threatening behavior in public. They cease to exercise social regulation over little things like litter on the street, loitering strangers, or truant schoolchildren. When law-abiding eyes stop watching the streets, the social order breaks down and criminals move in.
<p>	"Stable neighborhoods can change in a few months to jungles," declare Wilson and Kelling. Disorder also can have dire economic consequences. Shoppers will shun an area they perceive as being "out of control." One study analyzing crime in 30 different areas found that the level of disorder of a neighborhood -- more than such factors as income level, resident turnover, or racial makeup -- was the best indicator of an area's lack of safety.
<p>	For decades, most big-city police departments have devoted little effort to combating disorder. By allowing an accumulation of small infractions, this neglect creates an environment that generates big infractions.
<p>	The community-policing movement is beginning to change this. Community policing emphasizes giving neighborhoods a greater say in determining police priorities, a surefire way to bringing issues of physical and social disorder to the top of the police agenda. An important part of a community patrol officer's job is enforcing a community's norms of tolerable behavior and order. Beat officers can't impose their personal rules on a community, but they can help a community maintain its own standards. "You have to be given the latitude to enforce the laws in different ways in different communities," says Indianapolis's Elder.
<p>	Although calls for order maintenance have historically been associated mostly with white middle- and upper-class neighborhoods, today some of the loudest voices are coming from poor minority communities. Says Ace Backus, a Milwaukee community organizer, "In the nice white communities don't be drunk on the street, don't be throwing down litter, the cops will stop you. In the middle of the black ghetto you can do that and the police will drive past. It's reverse discrimination."
<p>
<b>Problems, Not Symptoms 
</b>

<p>	Conventional policing is incident-driven: A citizen calls 911 to report a crime and then the police show up. Much of the time, all officers can do at this point is take a report. By reacting to crime rather than trying to prevent crime, police treat only the symptoms, not the root causes of problems. The key to improving New York's subway was the emphasis on preemptive problem solving, an example of what policing experts refer to as "problem-oriented policing" (see <a href="#subway">sidebar</a>).
<P>	Former San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen frames the issue this way: "Random patrol duty is little better than sleeping on duty."
<p>	In one large city, for example, a trucking company had 32 trailers burglarized in less than 18 months. A predictable routine developed: The owner would report the crime, the police would visit the yard, take a statement, and then wait for the next call from the owner. In desperation, the owner finally threatened to move his $13-million company out of the city unless something was done to stop the stream of break-ins. 
<p>	This prompted the police department to abandon business as usual. An outside consultant was brought in, and police soon determined that the physical layout of the trucking yard was encouraging the break-ins. The officers talked the owner into improving the lighting and raising the fence. Police then worked with other city agencies to erect a barricade between the truck yard and the adjacent vacant city property that was being used as an escape route. Problem solved.
<p>	Some level of problem-solving occurs in every police department, but it is typically done in a haphazard fashion. San Diego is alone in making problem-solving a focal point of each police officer's daily duties. Because it depends on identifying recurring patterns of disruptive activity, problem-oriented policing depends on good information. 
<p>	San Diego's crime analysis unit has set up a sophisticated computer tracking system that officers can tap into to get information on 60 types of problems, previous attempts to solve specific problems, and recurrent problems in different geographical areas. While problem-solving gives police officers some tools and the analytical framework for approaching community safety problems, community involvement is still a key component. "There are no long-term solutions to problems unless the community is involved," says Nancy McPherson, formerly the city's neighborhood-policing coordinator.
<p>	As already noted, people tend to equate the frequency of crime in an area with how the external environment "looks" and "feels." Visible disorder sends warning signals to our brains of impending danger. Disorder is a sign that the social mechanisms of control that characterize healthy neighborhoods have broken down, which in turn encourages lawlessness. To build safer neighborhoods, individuals and communities must exercise control of the physical environment in which they live. 
<p>
<b>Empowering Landlords
</b><p>

 	Police officers appreciate the role that landlords can play in keeping a neighborhood strong and safe. Historically, landlords in low-income, working-class neighborhoods adhered to the neighborhood's set of norms and refused to rent to individuals who, in the landlord's judgment, would not be a positive force in the neighborhood. This is because landlords, for economic reasons, desire essentially the same thing as neighbors do for social reasons: responsible and conscientious tenants who will respect the property of others.
<p>	In recent years, government regulations, civil-rights laws, and court rulings have made it almost impossible for landlords to turn away dubious renters or to evict destructive tenants from their apartments. The unintended consequence? Many working-class neighborhoods have been ripped apart by rental units that become crack houses.
<p>	Giving homeowners control of their property can help reduce crime. Almost by accident, the city of Milwaukee came up with a simple yet effective way for government to assist, instead of frustrate, landlords who want to maintain neighborhood norms. Marty Collins, a 15-year city employee, was looking for a way to improve the city's drug-addiction prevention program. Knowing that most drug dealing in Milwaukee occurred out of rental properties, Collins reasoned that the only people that really could control the situation are the landlords. 
<p>	Collins surveyed Milwaukee landlords and found that 70 percent of them reported having had destructive tenants at one time or another, yet virtually no landlords were using tenant screening techniques. Why not? "For fear of getting their butts sued," says Collins. Milwaukee's landlords were largely unaware that legal methods were available to enable them to discriminate against prospective tenants with destructive histories. By taking simple precautions, such as requiring favorable recommendations from previous owners, running a credit check, and visiting the current home of prospective renters, homeowners can eliminate the bad apples and help keep their neighborhoods safe.
<p>	Most landlords were also unaware of three Milwaukee companies that provide a listing of all tenants who have been previously evicted from rental properties. Milwaukee now informs all landlords how to be more discriminating.
<p>	While Milwaukee deserves credit for giving landlords the legal leverage they need to protect their property, the city sometimes goes too far in holding landlords responsible for the actions of their tenants. If police receive two complaints about drug dealing at a rented property, Milwaukee undercover police will attempt a drug buy. If successful, the city sends a notice to the landlord instructing him or her to take actions to stop the property from being used for drug dealing. If the problem persists, the city takes the landlord to court and can ask for the property to be forfeited. 
<p>	In essence, Milwaukee is asking the landlord to control their tenants' behavior or risk losing their property. Empowering landlords by allowing them to choose to whom they will and will not rent is one thing. Asking them to be responsible for the actions of their renters is quite another. Providing landlords with the legal assistance to screen and evict disruptive tenants is a step in the right direction, but we shouldn't expect landlords to act as chaperones for their tenants.
<p>	This trend toward relying on landlords to discipline tenants is ironic, for in many cases the most irresponsible landlord of all is the government. Much of the worst crime in America takes place in or around government housing projects. When Reuben Greenberg became the police chief of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1982, he thought it ludicrous that the government routinely rented units to the lowliest criminals of society. "No other landlord has to rent to child molesters, robbers, rapists, and arsonists. Why should people in public housing have to live with them?" asked Greenberg.
<p>	Working with city housing authorities, Greenberg set out to make the city's public housing the last place criminals would dare to set up shop. Prospective tenants were screened for criminal records. Tenants who engaged in illegal behavior were swiftly evicted. Through mostly common-sense measures that any sensible landlord would take, Charleston's public housing projects are now "the safest places to live in Charleston," says department spokesman Charles Francis.
<p>
<b>Closing off Streets</b>
<p>	Americans like to control their space. With their long driveways, high walls, and security systems, wealthier neighborhoods have never been known for their accessibility to outsiders. Wealthy city-dwellers have "doormen" that provide security for their apartment buildings. Middle-class suburbs have their own ways of discouraging strangers, including myriad cul-de-sacs and white picket fences. Residential community associations (RCAs) have taken the concept of designing for safety one step further. The typical RCA has walls, gates, cul-de-sacs, security systems, and an endless series of speed bumps. 
<p> 	In contrast, poor city neighborhoods are typically laid out in a grid format. "By allowing for lots of through traffic, grids compromise a neighborhood's integrity," says Judy Butler, the city of Houston's neighborhood coordinator. The grid format, while pleasing to city traffic engineers, makes neighborhoods susceptible to drive-by shootings and random through-traffic. 
<p> 	While some criticize the suburbs and RCAs for having a "fortress mentality," these communities provide residents with the security they desire, providing physical barriers that give people greater control over their living environment. These barriers not only keep strangers out, they mark the physical boundaries that define communities.
<p>	"Why not try to redesign the urban area to recapture the quality of life in the suburbs?" asks Oscar Newman, a city planner and architect. Newman is the country's leading expert on and proponent of creating "defensible space" in urban neighborhoods by closing off streets. Street closures, Newman has found, give residents greater control over the security of their neighborhood. Closures also broadcast a distinct message to potential criminals: This community is profoundly serious about deterring crime and anti-social behavior.
<p>	St. Louis has a long tradition of street closures. Beginning in the late 19th century, many streets in the wealthiest neighborhoods were deeded to residents instead of the city. Each of the streets was represented by an association that often also owned the sewers and water mains. At the time, St. Louis had shoddy public services, so the private streets were a way of attracting homebuyers by assuring them of reliable services such as water supply and street lighting.
<p>	In the 1950s, St. Louis was in decline. Crime was rising, property values were falling, and much of the middle class was fleeing to the safer and cleaner suburbs. Left behind were poorer residents, less likely to be homeowners and more likely to be transient. To stop the flight of middle-class homeowners out of the city, the city began to revive its private street program. Neighborhoods of all income levels were allowed and encouraged to petition the city to convert their public streets to private ownership. Many middle-class neighborhoods took the city's offer: They formed homeowner associations, put up gates, and assumed the costs and responsibilities of maintaining the streets themselves. 
<p>	Since the mid-1970s, more than 1,000 St. Louis streets have been closed off and privatized. By making these neighborhoods more distinct, street closures have made it easier to identify intruders and keep out unwanted visitors. The result: lower crime rates and higher property values compared to adjacent neighborhoods, according to Newman. It also has made the neighborhoods more cohesive, as they become safe places for children to play and conduits for social activity. "With traffic flow limited to an occasional moving car, the street has become an extension of the front yards of the abutting houses: an area where children play and adults can meet and socialize," writes Newman. Street closures can restore the balance between mobility for cars and livability for residents. 
<p>	Until recently, St. Louis was about the only city that made use of street closures in urban settings. But the increasing levels of crime, gang activity, and drive-by shootings throughout urban America are prompting other cities to experiment with street closures. Cities as diverse as Dallas, Chicago, Houston, Dayton, and Fort Lauderdale are aggressively closing off streets. Though St. Louis is unique in allowing a transfer of ownership to residents, these urban enclaves are proving an effective way for a community to regain control of its environment.
<p>	Dayton, Ohio, is home to one of the country's most ambitious street-closure experiments. Like many aging urban communities, Five Oaks, an integrated, lower-middle-class neighborhood in Dayton, found itself in decline. Homeowners were leaving, rental properties were poorly maintained, and drug dealers and prostitutes had set up shop. Located near the freeway, Five Oaks was an ideal location for crack houses. Experts predicted that within two years much of the neighborhood would be a disaster area.
<p>	In 1992, desperate neighborhood leaders turned to street closures. The city called in Oscar Newman to assist. A year later, 34 streets and 26 alleys were closed off in Five Oaks. Neighborhood residents divided Five Oaks into ten mini-neighborhoods to enable law-abiding residents to confront the problems in their immediate area.
<p>	Only a year after the streets were closed, substantial improvement was visible. Cut-through traffic, previously a big problem in the neighborhood, fell by two-thirds. Automobile accidents and traffic speed levels also declined dramatically. After dropping the previous two years, housing sales surged 55 percent, while the average purchase price of a home increased 15 percent. Violent crime was cut in half; overall crime plunged by 26 percent. Most importantly, Five Oaks residents felt much safer and in control of their immediate surroundings. "I have four little kids," said one neighborhood homeowner. "My kids can now play out in the yard. It's been a blessing for my family."
<p>
<b>Reclaiming Public Parks</b> 
<p>	Another problem of "space" in many cities (and some suburbs too) are local parks. Instead of serving as a place for kids to play and families to picnic, many parks have become gathering places for gangs and drug dealers. Instead of serving as a common area that knits the community together, many neighborhood parks are tearing communities apart. 
<p>	City officials refer to such parks as "orphan" parks because there is no real or perceived "ownership" of the park, and so no one takes care of it. City hall cannot possibly provide the same level of attention as the people who use the park every day. Local involvement is needed to make small parks a positive force in the neighborhood; only neighborhood residents, the people who use the park, can provide this. 
<p>	The inspiring story of San Antonio's Lee's Creek Park proves the point. "It's not every 41-year old that can leave a legacy for his children," says San Antonian Bill Lucas as he looks over the plans for Lee's Creek Park, a project that engrossed him for over a year. Lucas does not work for the city planning or recreation department -- he is a sales manager for Bekins Moving Systems. <p>
	Donated by the Lee family to the city, the park is located in a declining area of the city with swelling gang problems. After 10 years, it was still little more than a vacant lot. Then along came Bill Lucas and the local chapter of Optimist Club International, the 75-year-old "friends of youth" organization. In conjunction with around 35 neighborhood families, the Optimist Club transformed the weed-infested vacant lot into a thriving community parkwithout the aid of taxpayer money. Creating Lee's Creek Park was a true volunteer effort. A bridge over the creek was a gift from an Optimist Club member in memory of his wife. A running track was donated by a construction company. The sweat to clear the lot and plant the trees was contributed by neighborhood residents and even some nonresidents, including Mrs. Lee herself. "All we are doing is recreating in a small way neighborhood involvement like it was in the 1800s in America when people used to pitch in and help build their neighbors' houses and barns," says Lucas.<p>
	When the park was finished it was turned back over to the city, which agreed to maintain it. Lucas is confident the park will not fall victim to "orphan park" syndrome. "Our idea is for the neighbors to create ownership opportunities for themselves," he said. To do so, ownership committees were created and vested with control of certain blocked out sections of the park that they are responsible for beautifying and maintaining. The sense of ownership is critical. "If the park were given to us we wouldn't respect it," says Lucas. "We can see it in our own children. Make them earn it, and they own it." 
<p>	Turning over partial ownership or management of city parks to nonprofit groups and neighborhood associations is often the best way to ensure they remain a public asset. New York City's Neighborhood Open Space Coalition has assumed control of hundreds of abandoned lots and parks in this way, turning many dangerous eyesores into gardens. Nearly one-fourth of the city's nearly 1,500 public parks are now cared for by community associations under the Operation Green Thumb program.
<p>	Private groups usually have more success ensuring the park is in constant use, which is the key to keeping a park safe. The nonprofit Central Park Conservancy has raised more than $100 million for New York City's Central Park since its founding in 1980. It has taken over the care of trees, lawns, and plants and provides more than half of the park's operating costs. By 1989, 72 percent of Central Park users said the park felt safer after the conservancy got involved. Crime dropped 59 percent and robberies plummeted 73 percent. The drop in crime is attributed to the large increase in park activities put on by the conservancy. Good uses drove out the bad uses.
<p>
<b>Crisis Point</b> 
<p>	What is the future of public safety in America? One possibility is that we will continue to ask police to attempt the impossible: To create safe communities without the communities' help. Under this scenario, there will be more cops, more prisons -- and more crime.
<p>	The other possibility is more appealing. We can learn from America's most innovative public-safety models -- San Diego's problem-oriented, neighborhood policing; New York's subway-disorder reduction; Milwaukee's landlord empowerment policies; and Dayton's Five Oaks street closures -- to develop a new vision of policing America's neighborhoods and downtowns where police departments are closer to the communities they serve and citizens and communities take a more active role in protecting their safety. 
<p>	Under this scenario, America could see a future with fewer police and more security. We are fast approaching a crisis point in our country as crime and fear of crime paralyze our nation. How we respond will go a long way in determining what we become as a nation.

<a name="sandiego"></a><b>San Diego's Trailblazing Example (sidebar)</b>

<p>	Community policing demands that both police and citizens accept responsibilities. The community's contribution can take many forms, from setting up community watches and getting landlords to screen potential renters to cleaning up vacant lots, reporting suspicious behavior, and making sure teenagers don't roam the streets. If citizens don't take responsibility for the safety of their own community, the police can do little to help. 
<p>	San Diego's bold effort to involve citizens in public safety is unheard of among big cities. One San Diego official related this story: "I told a group of our officers that we were planning to have civilian volunteers take crime reports and collect evidence in cases of petty thefts. About three-quarters of them were nodding their heads, saying, 'Yeah, that makes sense.' If I tried that in New York or Chicago, they'd laugh me out of the room."
<p>	At San Diego's Eastern Division police headquarters, a group gathers around a conference table regularly to discuss better ways to patrol a certain neighborhood. But these blue-shirted peacekeepers aren't police officers. They are gray-haired volunteers of the Retired Senior Volunteer Patrol (RSVP), a major component of San Diego's commitment to neighborhood policing. 
<p>	"The partnership between the community and our department really works," says police captain Dan Berglund. In addition to 272 sworn officers, Berglund's division relies on 115 senior volunteers, 20 reserves, and 40 other resident volunteers. "Their influence in their own community has been extremely beneficial," says Berglund. 
<p>	Neighborhood policing requires a fundamental change in the department's operating philosophy. The police shift their attention from rapid response to putting more officers out on regular beats, where they can help the community solve public-safety problems. Neighborhood policing also entails much greater use of volunteers and soliciting the concerns of the citizens. In the language of Tom Peters, neighborhood policing means "getting close to the customer." 
<p>	San Diego uses volunteers in a wide range of nonconfrontational situations, such as towing cars, collecting evidence (including fingerprinting), and checking on the homes of absent neighbors. Instead of assigning a uniformed officer to spend, say, 45 minutes writing a report for a petty theft, San Diego uses volunteers trained at the police academy. This frees up officers for problems that require their special skills. "So long as volunteers are given meaningful work, and welcomed as a partner in the process, I will have an unlimited number of people in any community in this city to do that," Berglund said. 
<p>	The SDPD is unusual in its openness to citizen input and volunteer assistance. Admittedly, San Diego is blessed with many retirees. Although it's the sixth-largest city in America, San Diego's police force has a small-town feel. In most big cities, powerful police unions would oppose the use of community volunteers for police work. But San Diego welcomes them. 
<p>	This tolerant culture, which took years to develop, is due partly to Police Chief Jerry Sanders's deep commitment to community policing. San Diego is the first large city to adopt a department-wide approach to community policing. Nearly every SDPD police officer belongs to a team assigned to a discrete geographical area and charged with developing a close relationship with that neighborhood. "We are using persuasion rather than coercion to get people on board," says Nancy McPherson, who served as San Diego's neighborhood-policing coordinator before moving on to the Seattle police department.
<P>	Police departments customarily resist community policing because cops fear they will become social workers rather than crimefighters. The department dispelled that idea early on. After getting to know the residents on their beat, two San Diego cops trained in neighborhood problem-solving learned that a gang had taken over a particular section of an apartment complex. Through close relations with the building's law-abiding residents, they gathered the evidence needed to obtain search warrants. The bust that followed -- complete with SWAT teams and swarms of patrol cars -- put an end to the worry that neighborhood policing was soft on crime.

<p>

<a name="subway"></a><b>New York City's Subway (sidebar)</b><p>

	For years litter, graffiti, vagrants, and panhandlers had been turning New York City's subway into a vaguely sinister netherworld. The transit agency's first reaction to this problem was standard public-sector misjudgment: Add more "inputs." Additional police officers were assigned to patrol the transit system. The results were unimpressive, and riders remained frightened.
<p>	In the mid-1980s, David Gunn, the new transit authority president, decided to wage a war on the graffiti that covered nearly every square foot of every city subway car. Vast amounts of time and money had already been invested in increasing patrols and surveillance to reduce graffiti -- to no avail. Regardless of how many "taggers" were caught, there were always more. The overburdened courts never gave taggers more than stern lectures.<p>
	A deeper analysis of the graffiti problem revealed that taggers got a thrill from viewing their markings on future trips. Denied the satisfaction of beholding their "art," Gunn figured, many taggers would simply stop. He made the removal of graffiti from subway cars a top priority. The strategy worked. On May 12, 1989, five years after the launch of the Clean Car Program, the last of the graffiti-covered cars was removed from service. The Big Apple's notorious subway cars were among the cleanest in the world.<p>
	But removing the graffiti only solved part of the problem. New Yorkers still feared the disorderly people who always seemed to be hanging around the subway.
<p>	In 1990, the city hired William Bratton (now the city's police commissioner) as the new chief of transit police. "We understood early on that the problems of crime, disorder, and fare evasion were deeply interrelated," Bratton says, "and that therefore we would have to form a coherent strategy to deal with them." Bratton discovered that fare-jumpers not only cost the transit system more than $120 million a year in income, but also committed much of the crime and unruly behavior in the subway. He organized plainclothes "sweep teams" of four to six officers to catch fare-evaders. Says Bratton, "The sweeps produced some interesting results. One of every six fare-evaders we stopped either was carrying a weapon or was wanted for another crime on an outstanding warrant. That was an incredibly high statistic, and it made us realize that by fighting fare evasion, we were also making an impact on crime."
<p>	At the same time, Bratton set out to reduce the intimidating behavior of panhandlers and homeless people in the subways. Monthly ejections from the subway went from 2,000 to 16,000. In Bratton's first two years, the number of felonies in the subway fell 30 percent.

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.

Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.  
<p>

<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.  
<p>	  
When capital income, which would not be subject to personal income tax,  
is considered along with wage

<Font Size="2"><b>Less progressive.</b>  One potential criticism of the flat tax is that high-income groups appear to pay a lower percentage of their personal income in taxes than middle-income groups.  This occurs because higher-income groups receive a greater share of their earnings from capital income, which is exempt under the flat tax.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>
<center> 
<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government
<p>

<hr width="50%">
<Font Size="2"><b>More proportional.</b>  When income is defined comprehensively to include business income, taxes on higher-income groups remain remarkably proportional.  That's because the flat tax appears to shift some of the overall tax burden to businesses, whose taxes are borne disproportionately by (higher-income) business owners.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Possibility Awaits">A GREATER POSSIBILITY AWAITS</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

<h3><a name="Addendum">Taking on the Mortgage-Interest Deduction</a></h3>
<hr width="60%">

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
If the flat tax is to gain the support of the public, its advocates will have to confront defenders of existing 
deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<h3>The Environmental Benefits of Capitalism</h3>

	Profit and the environment are supposed to be enemies. Remember that the next time you visit Yellowstone National Park, one of the crown jewels of the national park system and a popular attraction for tourists, backpackers, and amateur botanists, zoologists, and geologists. Yellowstone boasts some of the most breathtaking sights in all of North America. It also boasts an interesting capitalistic pedigree.
<p>	It was the Northern Pacific Railroad, a private corporation, that funded early expeditions to the Yellowstone region and helped establish the Yellowstone National Park in 1872. "Because it provided the main form of transportation to the region," report economists Terry Anderson and Donald Leal, "the railroad could profit from preservation of this scenic wonder and therefore had an incentive to preserve it." Many other Western parks were promoted and protected by private railroad and development companies for the same reason.
<p>	More recently, some private timber companies have found that, by exploring other uses of the forest lands they own, they can increase their profits. In International Paper's commercial forests in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, company biologist Tom Bourland implemented a fee-based recreation program to make money from not harvesting trees. His program charged hunters for access and leased small tracts of land on which families could park their motor homes and enjoy the woods. After three years, International Paper saw its revenues from the program triple, constituting 25 percent of its total profits from the area. Since this valuable use of private land relied on beauty and diverse wildlife rather than ease of harvest, the company had an incentive to preserve habitat for white-tailed deer, wild turkey, fox, squirrel, quail, bald eagles, and red-cockaded woodpeckers.
<p>	Deseret Land and Livestock pursued a similar strategy when its cattle ranch fell on hard times. The firm's managers decided to invest in wildlife habitat, charging hunters for the right to hunt elk and other animals. Herds of elk and mule deer -- now a valuable commodity -- on Deseret land actually grew, and the company thrived. The 1,289-square-mile King Ranch in south Texas now makes 60 percent of its income from business activities other than cattle -- including revenues from hunters and nature lovers.
<p>	Within the corporate social-responsibility movement, there is no more important issue than environmentalism. Often, the call for corporate responsibility and the exhortation to "save the planet" from a host of environmental problems seem virtually to be the same thing. The firms most often honored for their responsibility -- such as the Body Shop, Patagonia, and Ben and Jerry's -- usually exhibit some sort of (highly publicized) commitment to environmental goals. "Corporations, because they are the dominant institution on the planet, must squarely face the social and environmental problems that afflict humankind," states Paul Hawken, a founder of Smith and Hawken catalog company. "How," he asks, "does business face the prospect that creating a profitable, growing company requires an intolerable abuse of the natural world?"
<p>	The notion that profit and ecology must be at loggerheads, and that businesses must place environmental obligations above economic ones, is but one viewpoint among social-responsibility advocates. A different notion, championed most famously by Vice President Al Gore, is that doing business in an "environmentally friendly" way is also to increase the profitability of firms. "We can prosper," he wrote in his book <i>Earth in the Balance</i>, "by leading the environmental revolution and producing for the world marketplace the new products and technologies that foster economic progress without environmental destruction."
<p>	When you think through the complex issue of corporate environmental responsibility, however, neither Hawken's "win-lose" proposition nor Gore's "win-win" proposition ultimately satisfies. Both have merit, but ignore the most important characteristic of environmental ethics: uncertainty. For Hawken, the fact that the world is headed for catastrophe is scarcely debatable. Only if you buy his apocalyptic predictions about overpopulation, global climate change, deforestation, and depletion of natural resources does his recipe for a low-growth, heavily regulated, "sustainable" economy make any sense. 
<p>	In Gore's case, he makes no conceptual distinction between profiting from innovation and profiting from regulation. Throughout much of his book, he argues that governments should make environmental regulations more strict, repeating many of the doomsday scenarios of which Hawken is fond, but then concludes that American firms can make money designing technologies to meet the higher standards. This is no doubt true, but it ignores the firms -- actually shareholders, workers, and consumers -- who clearly lose when regulatory standards change.
<p>	Innovative compliance might reduce the cost of regulation, but it doesn't eliminate it. For example, a state might decide to require that only cars fueled by electric batteries will be sold within its borders. This might well lead to the development of better, cheaper electric cars, as firms struggle to capture as much as they can of the new automobile market, but that's not the only consideration. Under the mandate, consumers would lose access to the products they prefer. Some individuals and businesses would leave the state entirely. The resulting costs and dislocations would far exceed the environmental benefits of lower auto emissions, which are questionable in any event. (The generation of electricity for the cars, for example, would still produce some air or water pollution.)
<p>	Gore, in other words, is essentially arguing that it's worth building a better mousetrap, regardless of how many mice you think may be actually running around in your house. But what if the more pressing problem you face in your home is termite infestation? Then the mousetrap doesn't help you.
<p>	In a different sense, though, Gore is on exactly the right track in charting a course for corporate responsibility on environmental matters. Corporations are not governments. They are not charities. They are unlikely to be successful if they pursue the same sorts of strategies that governments and philanthropic organizations use to protect wildlife habitats and promote clean air and water, such as setting and enforcing standards of health and safety for the public. Corporate America's unique contribution to solving real environmental problems will come from innovation -- finding new ways to produce goods and services, package and deliver them to consumers, and dispose of or recycle the wastes generated by their own production or by consumption.
<p>
<b>Pollution and Profits</b>
<p>	Corporate innovation in the pollution-reduction area is already widespread. The "Pollution Prevention Pays" program begun by Minnesota-based 3M in 1975 has reduced the company's emissions by more than a billion pounds while saving $500 million.
<p>	"At our company, we view a good portion of the environmental problems most talked about today as symptoms of an underlying disease," said 3M chairman Livio D. DeSimone. "That disease is waste -- the wasteful and inefficient utilization of our resources."<p>
	Similarly, Dow Chemical and Westinghouse have implemented waste reduction strategies that have saved millions of dollars since the mid-1980s. One Westinghouse plant in Puerto Rico reduced "dragout" -- the contamination accidentally spread as chemicals flow from one tank to another -- by 75 percent by shaking the tank to remove solids before releasing the chemical on to the next tank. Chevron saved $10 million in waste disposal costs and reduced hazardous waste by 60 percent in the first three years of its "Save Money and Reduce Toxics" (SMART) program.<p>
	Over the past few decades, timber companies have found that "sustainable-yield forestry" -- including preventing fires, spraying for pests, and quickly replanting harvested areas -- produces less waste and higher profits while also preserving habitat for wildlife. In addition, they have reformed their manufacturing processes, for example by using leftovers from lumbering to make paper pulp and to generate steam for paper mills. International Paper saved about $100 million in disposal expenses between 1988 and 1995 by recycling and reusing its manufacturing wastes.
<p>To be successful both at saving money and "saving the planet," however, corporate waste-reduction programs can't be based on rhetoric or ideology or guesswork about what is or isn't environmentally friendly. One of the greatest myths propagated by the corporate social-responsibility movement is that the most environmentally friendly way to produce goods and services is already known, and that all corporate executives need do is embrace the environmental ethic. This is untrue. Often, the consequences of corporate decisions are ambiguous in terms of overall affect on species, health, air, and water quality, and the global environment. In some cases, the very practices advocated by environmental activists harm the environment.
<p>	Consider the historical example of the automobile. Given the attention paid to air pollution and oil spills, one might believe that the environment would be better off if cars had never been invented and mass-produced for widespread use. But such a judgment would be hasty. Although cars created a new source of air pollution, they also virtually eliminated one of the oldest sources of air and water pollution known to man: animal dung.
<p>	A horse, for instance, produces about 45 pounds of manure each day. In American cities before the advent of automobiles, massive amounts of horse manure collected daily on streets, sidewalks, and public property. The resulting mess fouled the air, and contaminated water and food. It had to be collected and dumped or buried, often at great expense. And the horses died. In the late 19th century, New York City had to dispose of some 15,000 dead horses a year. Sometimes this difficult task wasn't performed as quickly as it should have been, resulting in outbreaks of disease.
<p>	In 1885, a British writer described London in the supposedly pristine days before the car. "It is a vast stagnant swamp, which no man dare enter, since death would be his inevitable fate. There exhales from this oozy mass so fatal a vapor that no animal can endure it. The black water bears a greenish-brown floating scum, which forever bubbles up from the putrid mud of the bottom. . . . It is dead."
<p>	Fred Smith, the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, in Washington, D.C., and a former environmental regulator, notes that the automobile swept away many of these environmental problems. Besides reducing the need to deal with horse and draught-animal wastes and corpses, the car "encouraged developments that reduce air pollution," he observed in Reason magazine. Before the automobile, most urban homes and businesses were heated with coal, an extremely dirty source of energy that spewed sulfur dioxide, particulates, and toxic ash into the air. As the demand for gasoline stimulated oil exploration, heating oil and natural gas became cheaper and more readily available.
<p>	Did the inventors and early manufacturers of the automobile perceive its potential environmental benefits? Have General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler been run by environmental activists for the past half-century? Hardly. Their environmental records are mixed. Nor have all the environmental problems created by the human need for transportation and fuel been "solved" -- particularly in those unique areas, such as southern California, where topography and climate make auto emissions, regardless of how numerous their source, a continuing problem. The automobile example shows only that economic decisions, motivated by an insatiable demand for higher productivity, lower costs, and bigger profit margins, can have unforeseen benefits for third parties and the environment.
<P>
<b>It's Not Easy Being Green</b>
<p>	One problem for corporate managers is that years of apocalyptic rhetoric and breathless media coverage have created environmental illiteracy among many Americans, including potential consumers and employees. When McDonald's first began to research whether its plastic "clamshell" hamburger boxes posed a significant waste-disposal problem, company scientists came to the conclusion that paper wrappers would actually be harder to recycle. But in a well-publicized 1990 decision, the restaurant chain nevertheless switched to paper.
<p>	The reason wasn't sound environmental policymaking, but public relations. A letter-writing campaign organized by environmental activists and teachers had schoolchildren across the country telling their favorite fast-food outlet (and their parents) that they wanted paper rather than plastic to "save the planet." McDonald's complied. Subsequently, a study in <i>Science</i> concluded that the plastic alternative was less environmentally harmful, once all the relevant costs -- such as the energy expended to make the paper wrappings -- were factored in.
<p>    Not only did McDonald's appear to make the environmentally "wrong" decision, but the company also nipped a promising business venture in the bud. Before the paper-packaging decision was announced, Dow Chemical and seven other plastic manufacturers had formed the National Polystyrene Recycling Company to recycle polystyrene from 450 McDonald's restaurants. The switch to paper nixed the deal, which would have advanced plastics recycling.
<p>	The effect of corporate decisions on the environment are, in other words, extremely difficult to predict with accuracy. Corporations pursuing profit have as much chance of generating environmental benefits as regulators or environmental activists do -- particularly when they are faced with prices for waste disposal that are as close to cost as possible.
<p>	For natural resources over which property rights are relatively easy to establish, such as oil, minerals, or timber, prices serve as an early-warning signal to companies about scarcity. If the price is rising, that suggests more demand for the resource than can be met by available supply. Companies then have a financial incentive either to find new supplies or to reduce its need by developing alternatives or ferreting out waste. This market process amounts to a sort of ongoing environment research project seeking an answer to this question: What is the most efficient and least resource-depleting method of producing the goods and services people need?
<p>	A good example of how this process works can be found in the development by Bristol-Myers-Squibb of a new way to make Taxol, a treatment for ovarian and breast cancer. Taxol had been made from the bark of the endangered Pacific yew tree, but the process killed the tree. Responding to the mounting cost of obtaining Pacific yew bark, the company found a way to make Taxol from the needles and twigs of the more common Himalayan yew tree, thus assuring a continued supply of Taxol while reducing the need to harvest the endangered species.
<p>	For resources over which property rights haven't been established, either because of technical difficulty or because of bad public-policy decisions, the pricing system doesn't work as well. When governments relieve corporations of the need for pay the full cost of disposing of waste, for example, by operating and subsidizing waste collection, landfills, incinerators, and recycling programs, they reduce the incentive for those corporations to find alternative methods that produce less waste.
<p>	
<b>Environmental Surprises</b>
<p>	Some ecological benefits come from surprising places. Man-made pesticides and the companies that produce them, for example, are often reviled for the risks they supposedly pose to humans and habitats. But according to Dennis Avery, the director of global food issues for the Hudson Institute, the Herculean efforts by American companies and researchers to make farming more productive -- by introducing insecticides, herbicides, crop-breeding, and genetic engineering -- have reduced the need for farmland in the United States and other countries. Besides lowering the real price and improving the quality of the foods consumers buy, this happy result has had the side-effect of protecting forests and other sensitive habitats from being cleared for agriculture. "Today's typical environmentalist worries about how many spiders and pigweeds survive in an acre of monoculture corn without giving environmental credit for the millions of organisms thriving on the two acres that didn't have to be plowed because we tripled crop yields," Avery comments.
<p>	Actually, reducing the price and improving the quality of agricultural produce has had its own salutary effects on human health. Throughout human history, most people in most societies have had little to eat. Starvation has until recently been the typical state of much of the Earth's population. Only within the past century, and especially since the early 1900s, has agricultural productivity increased rapidly enough to guarantee a plentiful supply of food at affordable prices in developed countries. 		Much of this productivity is due to the invention and production of agricultural chemicals and the development of new farming practices by American entrepreneurs. Even today, herbicides and pesticides make fruits and vegetables cheaper and more attractive. One study by Texas A&M University researchers found that without pesticides, potato yields would drop 50 percent, orange yields by 55 percent, and corn yields by 78 percent. Prices for these commodities would rise tremendously without pesticides.
<p>	Companies introducing these agricultural innovations have clearly advanced the interests of their shareholders, too. The Monsanto Co., founded in 1901 to produce saccharin in competition with German firms, has since diversified into chemicals, fibers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. Two of its most profitable products for the past 30 years have been the popular herbicides Lasso (introduced in 1969) and Roundup (1973), one of the best-selling agricultural products of all time. Monsanto continues to introduce new products to increase agricultural productivity, such as Posilac, which boosts milk production in cows and reduces per-unit consumption of feed grains.
<p>
<b>Plastic Pleasures</b>
<p>	If anything symbolizes the irresponsible corporation in the minds of many theorists, it is the manufacturer of that epitome of 20th-century wastefulness, plastic. Typically made from oil, a nonrenewable resource, plastic has come to represent everything that is wrong with American commercial life and our "throwaway culture." But is plastic really a significant environmental problem? Does it provide no benefits to human health and safety or the environment that need to be weighed?
<p>	William Rathje, a professor of archeology at the University of Arizona, has spent years studying solid-waste disposal patterns. His excavations of landfills have found that plastics make up about 7 percent by weight and 16 percent by volume of the typical landfill -- much less than paper or yard waste. Polystyrene plastic, used in drinking cups and those "clamshell" hamburger containers McDonald's abandoned, makes up only 1 percent of landfill volume. Fast-food packaging amounts to no more than one-third of 1 percent. Of course, environmentalists fault plastic for much more than taking up space in landfills. They point out that plastic manufacturing relies on extracting and transporting oil. But since less than 2 percent of the world's petroleum is used to produce petrochemicals of all kinds, from fertilizers to plastics, the impact on oil consumption of using plastic to make consumer products is negligible.<p>
	Consider, on the other hand, the benefits of plastic. Even something as banal as plastic wrap has been a tremendous boon for Americans' health and safety. A hundred years ago, grocery stores had little in the way of prepackaged foods. At the turn of the century, paper packaging began to enter food retailing, but it had limitations. Meat, for example, was still often shipped in the form of whole carcasses only 50 years ago. Consumers would request particular cuts of meat from butchers, who kept carcasses until they were all sold or completely spoiled. The meat was expensive, particularly because butchers spent so much time carving it.
<p>	During the 1950s, however, the advent of plastic packaging began to change food delivery. Dow Chemical of Midland, Michigan, was an industry leader, not only in supplying plastic products to businesses but also by introducing its first major consumer product, Saran Wrap, in 1953. Plastic packaging allowed grocers to sell smaller portions at lower prices, and consumers to store food more efficiently and effectively. One study estimates that the modern system of packaging lowers the price of beef by about 40 cents a pound, while improving its quality.
<p>	Furthermore, the use of plastic and other types of packaging for foods seems to have reduced, not increased, total household waste. When Rathje took his garbage-archeology team to Mexico City in 1990, they found that the average household there discarded 40 percent more refuse each day than the average U.S. household, because Mexicans ate more whole fruits and vegetables and thus had more rinds, peels, and other food debris. In America, food processors sell prepackaged fruits and vegetables in cans, bags, or microwaveable plastic containers. From an environmental standpoint, this has the effect of accumulating the food debris in a central location, thus making it easier to dispose of in the form of compost, animal feed, and other products.
<p>	Today, the American plastics industry is one of the most innovative in the world. By finding new ways to manufacture, package, and store products that cost less, last longer, require fewer resources, and reduce harm to the environment, the industry is constantly improving the way we live. Since World War II, innovations in the manufacture, design, and use of plastics have yielded tremendous benefits for the public in terms of safety, health, economy, and quality of life. Consider these examples:
<p>	Plastic tubing made possible the first disposable, ready-to-use hypodermic needles. Initially introduced for combat use in the 1940s, the disposable needle soon made it possible to conduct safe and effective mass inoculations against disease in America and throughout the world.
<p>	In 1945, Earl Tupper introduced the first flexible plastic storage containers to replace glass, earthenware, and metal containers for storing food and other perishables. His product, Tupperware, vastly improved the freshness and quality of stored food.
<p>	Plastic siphon tubing made mass irrigation possible in the 1940s and 1950s, thus contributing to the Green Revolution that increased agricultural productivity and eliminated famine in much of the world. In the 1960s, plastic pipes began to replace other forms of piping for water distribution and drainage, because they were lighter and easier to install and resisted corrosion better than alternatives.
<p>	Plastic innovations during the past three decades by such companies as Phillips Petroleum, Union Carbide, and Shell Chemical have made possible such life-saving and life-enhancing products as artificial organs, comfortable prosthetics, body armor for law-enforcement personnel, unbreakable but light children's toys, and many automotive parts.
<p>	Cheap, all-temperature performance, flame-retardant, high-impact-resistant plastic parts made the first home computers -- manufactured by Apple Computer and Tandy -- viable products.
<p>	Lingering environmental controversies such as the risks of dioxin -- which many view as a potent human carcinogen -- are being resolved by plastic designers who, just in the past few years, have developed products that reduce or eliminate these real or perceived environmental problems. GE Plastics, for example, developed a new flame-retardant product that doesn't produce dioxin and that is also easier to make and costs no more than the plastic it replaces. Apple Computer is using the product in its Macintosh line of personal computers. Waste-to-energy plants, which dispose of about 60,000 tons of refuse each day and supply electricity to nearly a million Americans, also employ a series of technologies that reduce dioxin emissions to almost immeasurable levels.
<p>
<b>The Recycling Conundrum</b>
<p>	An article of faith among environmental advocates is that recycling will help American business conserve natural resources and demonstrate its environmental responsibility. This assumption doesn't account for the potential costs, including environmental costs, of pursuing recycling regardless of whether it is truly profitable.
<p>	For example, curbside recycling programs usually require more collection trucks. That means more fuel consumption and engine emissions. Some recycling programs produce high volumes of wastewater and use large amounts of energy. When researchers have tried to examine every aspect of the recycling equation -- from energy use to production costs -- they have found that sometimes recycling makes sense from an economic and environmental standpoint, while other times it does not.
<p>	Aluminum cans are a clear example of a commercial package that should be recycled. It takes 10 percent less energy to recycle aluminum than it does to make it from mined bauxite. So aluminum recycling is profitable -- and commonplace. Steel is also relatively economical to recycle. Virtually all products made with steel contain at least 25 percent reclaimed steel. On the other hand, recycling fruit-juice containers probably doesn't make economic or ecological sense. Filling disposable cardboard boxes takes half as much energy as filling recyclable glass bottles. For a given beverage volume, transporting the empty glass bottles requires 15 times as many trucks as does transporting disposable boxes. Transporting the containers once they are filled also costs less when using disposable boxes. Juice boxes don't break like glass bottles can, they are easily packed or frozen, and they seem to encourage juice consumption among the young, with whom they have proven to be popular.
<p>	For some commodities, such as newsprint, it seems that the only way to make recycling profitable is to force manufacturers to use them. Many states have laws requiring that newspapers contain a certain percentage of recycled paper, thus artificially creating a demand for newsprint. Even mandates sometimes fail to make recycling work: In Germany, laws requiring plastics recycling have resulted in a glut of collected plastics with few economical uses. Advocates for such laws point out that market prices don't capture all the costs of alternatives to recycling. But prices nevertheless contain important information. When forest stocks become scarcer, for example, the price of virgin timber rises, thus making recyclables more attractive. Similarly, as long as landfills are run to at least break even, then as they fill up their tipping fees will rise, again encouraging diversion of waste products into recycling or reuse. These price mechanisms already exist to a significant degree, and yet paper and plastic recycling often makes no sense absent government mandates.	

<p>For corporate managers trying to make heads or tails of the economic and environmental issues surrounding recycling, the answer may well be to trust an imperfect system of market prices over an even more imperfect attempt to guess at the ecological impact of various waste-reduction and recycling strategies. In everyday decisionmaking, this means weighing costs and benefits while maximizing shareholder return.
<p>

	Ford saved millions in 1994 when it converted several components of its automobiles into 100 percent recycled plastic. Chrysler is using completely recycled plastic in the interior trim of its popular minivans. Both car companies have made increasing use of these recycled plastics, made by companies such as Washington Penn Plastics and AlliedSignal, because of their cost and performance advantages over "virgin" plastic, not because of an attempt to meet some vague environmental goal. The savings "go straight to the bottom line," said Tony Brooks, Ford's special recycling coordinator. "Ford's position is that we will do everything we can to use recycled materials in our cars, but they can't cost more than virgin and they must perform at least as well as virgin."
<p>
<b>Problem, Innovation, Solution</b>
<p>	Most environmental issues in America today represent not only public-sector controversies but also private-sector opportunities. For companies that can identify a problem and devise a solution, the potential profits are significant.
<p>	In the case of plastics, profit-seeking corporations are experimenting with edible food packaging that offers better protection, lower cost, and few environmental considerations. ConAgra, Inc., the processed-food giant, is working on an edible bag in which to package products such as frozen entrees that currently used plastic bags. "If you could make a boilable, edible bag, you could replace the plastic with something that is part of the food -- ultimately eliminating a source of package waste," says the company's packaging director, Brian Hopkins. Other companies are working along similar lines. Quaker Oats is testing edible coating for breakfast cereals. RJR Nabisco is working on a film made from milk protein that could be used to coat frozen fish products and baked goods.
<p>	These innovations aren't being pursued simply to reduce package waste. Food manufacturers also want to improve food preservation to enhance the taste and freshness of their products. Instead of having consumers buy whole fruits and vegetables, for example, and then slicing or dicing them at home, manufacturers could prepare large quantities of fresh produce -- such as pre-sliced onions or oranges -- and then preserve them with edible coatings. The cost of the foods would be lower, consumers could enjoy the convenience of pre-sliced ingredients, and waste peelings -- currently spread out over the entire population of homes -- would be centralized in manufacturing facilities and thus easier to dispose of. The resulting boon to human health would be significant. "Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables could be higher if this service were provided," says Attila E. Pavlath, a food scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<p>Other corporations are focusing their innovative energies on hazardous waste spills, hoping to profit from creative solutions to this most serious of environmental dangers. Whether it is the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 or Superfund sites or underground leakage of cancer-causing chemicals, the topic of hazardous waste often generates passionate feelings and great concern about environmental damage. But is the answer to spills to be found in banning substances or jawboning industry to reduce its dependency on them? Many entrepreneurial U.S. companies say no.

<p>The answer, they suggest, is to find new ways to clean up spills quickly, easily, and effectively. Bioremediation -- using bacteria or fungi either found in nature or engineered in laboratories to clean up hazardous wastes -- is a promising technology that offers the prospect of a cleaner economy without sacrificing the modern industrial processes that make our so economy productive. In Seattle, UNOCAL is using petroleum-eating bacteria to clean a six-acre patch of dirt where an oily residue of gasoline and disease fuels had accumulated over 65 years of leaks from its Seattle Marketing Fuel Terminal. Once the site is clean, UNOCAL expects to sell it for a significant price to commercial or residential developers.
<p>	Bioremediation isn't exactly a new idea -- municipal water systems have long used bacteria to purify sewage and paper companies have used them to remove organic matter from industrial sludgesbut a bustling new industry of bioremediation enterprises promises to clean up such hazardous materials as DDT, wood preservatives, toxic petrochemicals, and radioactive waste. Corporate pioneers in the area include Amoco and Du Pont, but most of the new technologies are coming from small, start-up firms such as Remediation Technologies of Concord, Massachusetts, Alpha Environmental in Austin, Texas, and Envirogen of Lawrenceville, New Jersey. Ironically, many bioremediation approaches have come from a close observation of how Mother Nature herself deals with waste. In searching for microbes to clean up oil spills, Alpha Environmental president Eugene Douglas said, "we went to where there are natural oil seeps in the Mediterranean, Central Asia, and North America, but where there isn't what you'd call pollution. Over time, microbes at these sites have evolved the ability to ingest that oil."
<p>	Bioremediation isn't the only solution profit-seeking corporations are working on. For the problem of oil spills, for example, Sea Sweep, Inc. of Denver, Colorado has developed an oil-absorbing, floating material, made from heating sawdust and woodchips, that will absorb 3.5 times its weight in oil. If administered to a spill, Sea Sweep will absorb the oil and then float to the surface for easy collection, after which it can be burned as fuel. Wyoming-based Centech has developed a centrifuge that generates relatively clean water and marketable oil from oil sludge, which is a serious problem around crude oil storage tanks and pipelines. In the area of industrial wastes, Tennessee's Olin Corp. has developed a process for dramatically reducing absorbable organic halides (such as dioxin) from the paper pulp-bleaching process. Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. has a process for dechlorinating wastewater streams.
<p>	It would be impossible to list all of the environmental innovations and inventions one can find in just a single year, ranging from simple reuse technologies at plant sites to machines and acids that remove virtually all known pollutants from energy plant emissions. Some of these technologies have been developed, as Gore suggests, in response to regulatory mandates. Others have come about as companies seek to reduce their waste disposal costs, improve the efficiency of their production processes, or find new areas of opportunity in a growing, constantly changing economy. It is through innovation and productivity gains, not through corporate munificence or a commitment to a theoretical environmental ethos, that American business will make its most important contribution to a cleaner world and the health and safety of the public. 
<p>	For corporate decisionmakers, true responsibility entails a recognition of the uncertainty that often accompanies environmental controversies and an unwillingness to put the interests of shareholders at risk by accepting environmental "truisms" at face value. It is by no means clear that simply recycling more, or substituting paper for plastic, or abandoning profitable enterprises because they require nonrenewable resources will necessarily serve environmental ends. Ultimately, such ends are determined and valued by human beings who also value healthful and reasonably priced foods, high-quality consumer goods, and job opportunities. The chances of making a poor decision are higher when corporate managers try to act like public policymakers or conservation experts.
<p>	Instead, as much as is practicable, corporations should let prices guide their decisions. In most cases, wasteful industrial practices impose measurable costs on firms, be they for waste disposal, raw-materials purchases, or lost customer revenue. Thus firms have every incentive to find alternatives. "For all environmental issues, shareholder value, rather than compliance, emissions, or costs, is the critical unifying metric," said McKinsey & Co. management consultants Noah Walley and Bradley Whitehead in their noted 1994 essay on corporate environmentalism in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. "That approach is environmentally sound, but it's also hardheaded, informed by business experience, and, as a result, much more likely to be truly sustainable over the long term."
<p>	An example of how truly responsible companies might make decisions about environmental issues is the case of Eco-Foam pellets, a substitute for Styrofoam peanuts in packing boxes or other containers. Texas-based American Excelsior Co. makes Eco-Foam out of corn starch and markets it as environmentally friendly. "The biggest benefit is that it's manufactured from renewable resources instead of petroleum products," says one local distributor. Should responsible companies concerned about the global environment use Eco-Foam instead of Styrofoam, then? Probably not. Managers need not evaluate all the pros and cons of the two products. They need only watch the price. In early 1995, Eco-Foam cost 25 percent more than Styrofoam. If we ever really start running out of oil, the price of petroleum products, including Styrofoam, will rise -- making alternatives competitive. Until then, the environmental benefits of switching to corn starch won't be worth the cost.
<p>	Public policymakers will continue to develop more efficient ways to regulate waste and pollution, and scientists will continue to gather information about the environmental risks from various substances or practices. As they do, pricing structures will evolve that communicate even more accurate information to manufacturers and entrepreneurs about the true cost of commercial activities and the potential rewards from innovative solutions to environmental problems.
<p>	There are many promising trends in environmental thinking and regulatory policy, from markets for emissions permits to the increased use of cost-benefit analysis to establish public priorities. Once ecological and economic ends are brought closer together, the perceived clash of interests between American business and Mother Nature will largely disappear. For corporations, the complex issues of environmental responsibility will always be challenging. But dealing with them requires no redefinition of the core profit-seeking purpose of economic enterprises.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>
	Two competing paradigms of education reform have emerged in the United States in recent years, and the differences between them are growing sharper. One, commonly termed "systemic reform," assumes that reform efforts should be led by government and imposed from the top down. Its advocates believe that state (or federal) authorities must set standards not only for student learning, but also for teacher training, pupil assessments, textbooks, and school resources. Though undertaken in pursuit of higher standards and better results, systemic reform relies on uniform strategies to ensure that "inputs" everywhere are equal and all schools undertake similar activities. Government resources and bureaucratic regulation are, of course, its preferred mechanism for making this happen. Much of Goals 2000 embodies this approach.<p>	The second reform paradigm, which we call "reinventing education," embraces decentralized control, entrepreneurial management, and grassroots initiatives, all within a framework of publicly defined standards and accountability. Under this approach, public officials establish standards, make assessments, and hold schools accountable for meeting performance goals but do not themselves run the schools. Public officials also retain the power to cancel charters and school-management contracts on grounds of consistently poor performance, but they do not directly supervise or control the means by which schools pursue those ends.<p>	Under this paradigm, education may be delivered through charter schools (licensed by public authorities such as a state, city, or local school district), "opt out" schools that secede from their local education agencies and run themselves with what amounts to a "block grant" of public funds, "contract schools" (in which a performance contract is negotiated between private educational managers and a public agency), and "choice" programs (in which students use scholarships or publicly-funded vouchers to attend the schools of their choice). In all such situations, the continuing responsibility of public authorities is to establish standards for educational and fiscal performance and monitor progress in relation to those standards. (Those who reject this degree of public accountability may, of course, turn to wholly private schools or home schooling.)<p>	The "reinvention" approach welcomes diverse strategies and schools organized and run by various entities such as teacher cooperatives, parent associations, private corporations, religious institutions, and community-based organizations. It assumes that students and families are different and should be free to match themselves to the schools that suit them best. It requires little bureaucracy and few regulations because it rejects the proposition that schools must be centrally managed according to a single formula.<p>	We strongly favor the "reinvention" paradigm, provided that it contains one key element borrowed from the "systemic" approach: standards and accountability. It is our conviction that only clear and high standards for performance will ensure accountability, both to the marketplace (that is, to families making informed choices among schools) and to whatever public body authorizes the schools to operate.<p>	These standards need not be national, they need not be highly detailed, they should not prescribe pedagogy or resource use, and they need not cover the entire curriculum. (Indeed, the ability of schools to add their own features to the "core" described in the standards is part of what will make them different from one another.) But only when such standards are in place -- and accompanied by good tests and a steady flow of performance information -- can parents make informed choices among schools and public authorities determine which schools deserve to retain their "charters," contracts, or accreditations.<p>	These two approaches are now competing with each other, not only in Washington, D.C., but also in the states. Systemic reform remains the favored strategy of the Clinton administration and of some educators (especially in state departments of education and teachers unions), but the "reinvention" alternative is preferred in many other quarters -- including by many elected officials, business leaders, and parents, as well as by teachers and principals who welcome the possibility of breaking free from the stifling grip of bureaucracy. <p>	The reinvention impulse has even reached Capitol Hill, where the past year saw stirrings of the first major push in memory to "devolve" centralized activities to states, communities, and families and to lift restrictions on the use of federal aid. This impulse arises partly from the quest for better education, but also from a reaction against the regulatory burden of federal regulations and unfunded mandates.<p>	This is the motive behind recent congressional activity concerning "block grants" in areas as diverse as welfare, school lunches, and job training, as well as education aid. To be sure, turning categorical programs into block grants and devolving control to states and communities will not automatically foster reinvention. Indeed, recipients may not do much of anything. But doing away with "Washington-knows-best" approaches and removing strings from federal dollars at least permits reform-minded states and communities to experiment with new strategies for education and other public servicesand closes the easy route of blaming Uncle Sam for poor results.<p>	The federal government is so hamstrung by special interest groups that getting it out of the way of change-minded states and communities may be the most we can expect from Washington on the "reinvention" front. Certainly, all efforts by Uncle Sam to foster such reforms directly have proven halfhearted at best and fraudulent at worst. The so-called "Improving America's Schools Act" of 1994, for example, banned any use of federal aid for privately managed public schools and created a school "choice" program so laden with preconditions and constraints that it must be termed phony. It enables members of Congress to say they "voted for school choice" while ensuring that there is none.<p>	Even rigorous accountability based on testing was discouraged by explicit prohibitions in the Goals 2000 legislation on the use of federal funds for this purpose. Those who believe that such reforms are the main hope for serious educational improvement are learning that Washington is the wrong place to look. But much is happening elsewhere in the nation under the "reinvention" banner.
<p><b>Potemkin Charters</b><p>	The charter school idea has picked up tremendous momentum, as have variants, such as a flock of new, miniature high schools in New York City that are not called charters but share many of their characteristics. Those qualities include a large measure of operational independence from headquarters in return for a promise to achieve certain results over a stated period of time. (New York City's quasi-charters, however, have not agreed to any educational performance goals, and their quasi-independence relies on waivers by the local teachers union, waivers that do not even apply to the schools' many other employees.)<p>	By summer 1995, 19 states had enacted explicit "charter" school laws, including eight during the most recent legislative session (Louisiana, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Texas, Alaska, Wyoming, Delaware, and Rhode Island). Several hundred such schools were scheduled to be open this fall. Charter schools are no panacea -- not in a country with 85,000 public schools -- but this movement is the second-most-exciting development on the educational reform front.<p>	Not all charter laws are created equal, however, and several enacted in recent months are so weak that they are unlikely to do much good. We think of them as "Potemkin" charter programs with an impressive facade but no substance. Some of these laws were supported by people who actually oppose charter schools on principle and had decided to undermine support for them by promoting a bill that pretended to create them. This is currently happening in New Jersey, where the state teachers union is supporting a weak charter bill in the state assembly, although a stronger, competing bill supported by the state education commissioner, the state senate, and Governor Christine Whitman may yet prevail.<p>	Weak charter laws generally suffer from at least one of three serious failings:<p><ul><li>	They require the prior assent of too many "stakeholders," such as a majority of teachers currently teaching in the affected schools, and contain no mechanism for creating new charter schools that do not already possess such stakeholders. Of course, it would be wonderful if existing schools converted to charter status with the support of a majority of teachers and parents working together, and that is sure to happen in some places. But there are also situations in which parents and community leaders want to start a new school, and they should be allowed to do sowith the staff they want to teach in it. (Currently, California's charter law requires the approval of a majority of teachers, as do those in Georgia, Hawaii, and New Mexico.)<p>
<li>	They place local school boards in sole charge of granting charters. (Wyoming, Louisiana, and Texas have recently enacted such laws.) Though such a limitation is invariably a key political goal of school board lobbyists, it can be fatal for charter schools, because the uniform policies of a benighted local board and risk-averse superintendent are usually what charter-seekers are keenest to escape. That is why strong charter laws either lodge the authority to issue charters with a different entity (such as a state superintendent or state board) or -- better yet -- create multiple windows or appeal mechanisms so that no single entity has the absolute power to deny a charter application. In Michigan and Minnesota, state universities have the authority to issue charters. In Arizona, besides vesting this authority in both local and state school boards, the legislature created a new "charter school" board exclusively for this purpose<p>.<li>	They neglect to exempt charter schools from enough of the statutes, regulations, and contractual provisions that burden conventional schools. Thus, the charter school is not truly free to chart its own course. The whole point of such a school, after all, is to gain autonomy of action in return for accountability for results. The only regulations that charter schools should be expected to comply with are those governing health and safety and protections against racial discrimination. But many states leave numerous other rules in place. If a state still requires that U.S. history be taught in the 11th grade, that a school's pupil-teacher ratio cannot exceed 25:1, that 40 minutes a day must be spent on math, that certain textbooks must be purchased, and if there is no respite from seniority rules, salary schedules, or tenure requirements, then we see little point in calling an entity so regulated a "charter school." Such a charter is unlikely to be worth the paper it is printed on -- and few will go to the bother of seeking such a document.</ul><p>
	Why have so many states created these Potemkin charter programs? The explanation, of course, has to do with power and politics, catalyzed by the education establishment's fierce resistance to changes that threaten its monopoly. Though many teachers and principals crave opportunities to "opt out" of the system and run their own schools without the incessant oversight, time-wasting regulations, and innumerable mandates of the bureaucracy, their professional organizations seldom see it this way. Thus teachers unions, school-board associations, and superintendents, if they cannot defeat the charter bill altogether, generally do their utmost to weaken it. So do other advocacy groupsfor example, special educationwhose stock-in-trade is rule-bound uniformity rather than diversity. In fact, the Southwest Regional Laboratory recently leveled a novel criticism: that charter schoolsprecisely because many of them demand a high degree of parent involvementare unfair to children with bad parents!<p>	Obtaining a charter does not end the hazards that await these schools. Most also encounter practical problems when they first launch. One perennial challenge is finding a place to operate a charter school. To our knowledge, no state provides charter operators with buildings or capital financing. Though this is no huge burden for existing schools that convert to charter status, it poses a great obstacle to the creation of new charter schools. Another problem is that many charter school founders and managers have little prior experience in matters such as financial management, purchasing, and marketing.<p>	Our hunch, however, is that these are birthing and growing pains associated with a feisty, infant reform strategy that will, in time, turn into a strapping youth. We doubt that opponents will be able to halt its growth. In England, where "grant-maintained" schools have been in place for several years -- and where almost a fifth of all secondary schools have "opted out" into this independent status -- even the Labor Party is having to come to terms with their continued existence. Indeed, party leader Tony Blair now sends his own child to a grant-maintained school.<p><b>Gains for School Choice</b>
<p>	There was major progress on the choice front in 1994-95, centering on Milwaukee and Cleveland. In Wisconsin, Governor Tommy Thompson succeeded in persuading the legislature to pass his proposal to expand Milwaukee's voucher experiment to include many more children and to permit attendance at church-affiliated schools. As revised, and assuming the courts eventually assent, up to 15,000 low-income Milwaukee children (nearly all of them minority) will be able to attend any school within the city limits.<p>	In Ohio, the legislature agreed to a proposal by Governor George Voinovich to initiate a voucher "pilot" in 1996 for children in Cleveland. That city's catastrophically bad school system was "taken over" by the state under a federal court order in early 1995. Here, too, church-affiliated schools will be eligible recipients of voucher-bearing youngsters -- up to 2,000 of them. And here, too, the primary beneficiaries of this reform will be low-income minority youngsters.<p>	Court battles have already begun, and we do not doubt that choice's foes, having lost two significant political battles, will now throw vast resources into the effort to get vouchers thrown out as a violation of the "Establishment Clause" of the First Amendment. In August, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction against the Milwaukee plan. But the governors and legislators of Wisconsin and Ohio deserve hearty applause from those who believe, as we do, that no child should be forced to attend a bad public school against his and his parents' will when a better school -- public, private, or hybrid -- is available close by. Because the families of poor children often lack the wherewithal to exercise such a choice on their own, it is the obligation of elected officials to make it possible for them, as they have historically done in higher education. That this will now happen in two major U.S. cities is a development of immense significance to American education. <p>	A number of other states stepped up to the "choice" plate in 1995 but struck out. In Texas, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Illinois, and Arizona, variations on the voucher theme failed to pass, and New Jersey delayed consideration of Mayor Bret Schundler's Jersey City plan until at least autumn of this year. The original Ohio choice bill, to encompass a broader area than Cleveland, was chopped down by the legislature. Another setback was the ruling by Puerto Rico's Supreme Court that the voucher program there violated the commonwealth's constitution.<p>	Nothing, of course, elicits tougher opposition from defenders of the public-school status quo than voucher schemes (and similar ventures that go by different names), even when such plans are aimed precisely at those disadvantaged children who are most likely to drop out of public school. But the idea is not going away. Meanwhile, privately-funded voucher projects also continue to multiply, from New York's Student/Sponsor Partnership, to the Golden Rule program launched in Indianapolis in 1991. Today 23 programs reach more than 10,000 students. <p>	We believe that it is just a matter of time before children from needy families in most parts of the country will be able to carry their vouchers (or scholarships or whatever they may be called) to any accredited school. We understand that some private schools fear government regulation, and may decline to participate. We recognize that public aid should be targeted toward those students in greatest need (as is now the case in higher education); and we acknowledge that the Supreme Court will have to sort through the constitutional questions posed by inclusion of parochial schools. (Recent Supreme Court decisions in this domain have encouraged voucher supporters.)<p>	Still, it must be noted that, in the meantime, primary and secondary schooling is becoming increasingly anomalous as vouchers come to prevail in most other domains of U.S. domestic policy. Even President Clinton has endorsed vouchers in job training and in public housing. Moreover, much of the rest of the world -- from Australia to Chile to the Netherlands -- treats publicly-subsidized private-school attendance as routine and normal.<p><b>Contract Management</b><p>
	Paul Hill's superb new book <i>Reinventing Public Education</i> sets forth a comprehensive vision of how this approach could work in the future -- and why it is apt to work better than direct operation of all schools by the school system's central office. Meanwhile, Educational Alternatives, Inc. (EAI) continues to manage a number of schools in Baltimore and recently added Hartford, Connecticut, to its portfolio. The superintendent of schools in the District of Columbia has tried to revive his plan to engage EAI to run some of D.C.'s troubled schools. A private management firm is functioning as "superintendent of schools" in Minneapolis.<p>The Edison Project opened its first four schools in 1995, with others due to follow if these succeed. And at least two other companies are already active in this field in the United States. Sabis is an international group that has been running a school in Minnesota and recently added a second (charter) school in Springfield, Massachusetts. Nashville-based Alternative Public School Strategies has reached an agreement with little Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, to run one of three elementary schools in that community -- a school in which 78 percent of students receive free or reduced-price lunches. (The future of this contract, however, is shadowed by ambiguity in the laws of Pennsylvania as to the legality of such an arrangement.) More companies and communities will surely follow, probably including big corporate guns such as Disney, which is creating a school in Florida that many view as a prototype.<p>	Unfortunately, not all the blossoms in this garden are healthy. EAI's relationship with a school in Dade County, Florida, has ended. Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke -- whose strong support is the main reason EAI has been able to withstand intense establishment pressure in that city -- has voiced dissatisfaction with student performance in the EAI-run schools after three years and has suggested that the arrangement may need to be rethought. And EAI's bold plan to alter budget priorities in Hartford kicked up such a storm from vested interests -- imagine shifting funds from surplus staff to areas such as technologythat the company and school board have decided to scale back most of the changes, at least for now, from the entire district to six schools that have "volunteered" for the full treatment. <p>	The difficulties of EAI in Baltimore and Hartford suggest that contracting will probably work best with new schools and with existing schools that are receptive. It is difficult to graft a new management program onto a school whose staff is determined to defeat the new managers. Perhaps private management should begin with a single school or manageable number of schools that want to be changed. Otherwise, the new managers will be forced to maintain all the elements of a system that currently does not work for children. And if they do, they will be doomed to fail.<p>	As for Edison, there is incredible pressure on its first four schools to be nearly perfect -- educationally, organizationally, and budgetarily -- from the very outset. The venture's future hinges on how well it meets these immense expectations. Every education journalist and researcher in the Western world is knocking on the Edison schools' door, probing for defects or missteps. No conventionally-run public school in America is likely to be subjected to the same degree of scrutiny or held to the same standards of perfection.<p>	In our view, contract management of public schools holds considerable promise, and these trials should be encouraged. We should also expect bumps along the road as these schools get their bearings; some may even fail. It is well to bear in mind, however, that we currently keep failing public schools open and even reward them when they should be closed down. Therefore, when a poorly run contract school or charter school is terminated, we should see such an action as a victory rather than a setback for the reinvention strategy. If and when that happens, it will prove that school authorities are willing to be held accountable for poor results.<p>	Meanwhile, beware the word "privatization," which is widely used by supporters of the current system to block all movement toward contract management. True "privatization" means selling or otherwise transferring a public asset to private owners who henceforth bear sole responsibility for its existence and are accountable to no one save their shareholders.<p>	That is what is happening to certain big, state-run factories in Eastern Europe, for example, but it is not what firms such as EAI and Edison are doing with the U.S. schools they manage under contract. Those schools remain public in every sense that a student, parent, taxpayer, or voter could think important: They are open to the public, financed by the public, and educationally and fiscally accountable to public authorities for their continued existence (and for the retention or termination of their private managers). Here is a sure test of whether an organization has been privatized: If public authorities can cancel the contract or withdraw the charter, the transaction is not privatization. It is a management contract on behalf of the public, not a transfer of public goods to private ownership.<p><b>Governance Changes</b><p>	The century-old governance structure of American public education is showing signs of change. As a recent <i>Education Week</i> headline put it, "Fervor spreads to overhaul state agencies."<p>	This year, it appears, 30 states carried out or at least considered reorganization or reduction of their education departments, mirroring the popular political trends of reducing government, pushing authority to local officials, and giving power to the elected officials whom the voters are apt to hold responsible at the polls for the effective use of their tax dollars. (Education spending is the largest or second-largest budget item in every state.)<p>	Texas offers a dramatic example. Now the second most populous state, Texas has been long known to have perhaps the most highly regulated school system in the country, with an immensely detailed education code and an all-powerful state education agency. Early this year, the legislature agreed with Governor George W. Bush Jr. that significant changes were needed. In effect, they repealed the entire education code and started afresh.<p>	The authority of the Texas Education Agency has been limited to six basic functions, including recommending education goals, granting campus charters, managing school funds, and administering federal programs. Several new categories of schools and school systems have been authorized, including "home rule" districts that are freed from most state mandates and charter schools that may be organized by individuals or groups outside the existing school system. (Unfortunately, as we noted earlier, almost all Texas charters must be issued by the local school board, and these boards are not likely to welcome dissenting approaches.) Texas also created a new network of alternative schools and made it easier to remove disruptive students from regular classrooms. And it created a powerful new state board for educator certification, to be named by the governor.<p>	Other states have taken different approaches. Minnesota abolished its department of education and merged these functions into a new department of children, families, and learning. Wisconsin took virtually all duties and powers away from its independently-elected state school superintendent, an office that was widely perceived as a captive of the education establishment, and turned them over to a new agency answerable to the governor. New Jersey's governor "froze" the regulatory process and directed the education commissioner and his colleagues to propose a comprehensive overhaul.North Carolina -- another highly centralized, heavily regulated state -- is shrinking its department of education by half and rewriting laws and regulations to give local districts far greater flexibility. The state has established annual performance standards for the state's almost 2,000 public schools based on "reasonable progress" in reading, writing, and math and with various interventions, sanctions (including suspension of principals and teachers), and rewards for success or failure to meet those standards. In other words, the state is moving from a regulatory compliance strategy to one based on standards and results.<p>	Illinois also made a radical change, though it affects only the city of Chicago, whose troubled and deficit-plagued schools have been the object of innumerable reform efforts in recent years. The legislature gave unprecedented control to the mayor, who has appointed (and can remove) all members of a small newly created "board of trustees" and a management team that includes a chief operating officer and fiscal, purchasing, and educational officers. The new law also places school principals in charge of all school employees (previously they had no authority over custodians) and authorizes them to set their own school hours and staff schedules. The Chicago Teachers Union is barred from bargaining over many nonsalary issues such as class size, staff assignments, academic calendar, hours and places of instruction, pupil assessment policies, privatizing services, and decisions over charter schools. It is also forbidden to strike for the next 18 months.<p><b>Will Unions Get with the Program?</b><p>	Chicago is not the only place where teachers unions have run afoul of public authorities. Largely because of their efforts to block state and local reforms, the unions are coming under more intense scrutiny and challenge. School boards, legislatures, and governors are promulgating policies and proposing legislation to abolish tenure, redefine collective bargaining rights, repeal "fair-share" agreements, and otherwise change laws and practices that sustain union interests and undergird their power.<p>	In Indiana, for example, the "fair share" law has been repealed. This law had authorized unions to extract fees from nonunion members in return for "services" performed for them by the unions, regardless of whether the individuals wanted those services. (An obvious example is a wage increase that affects all teachers in the district.) By repealing this law, the legislature made it illegal for unions to negotiate such arrangements with school districts. In another, more localized blow to the Indiana State Teachers Association, the legislature passed a reform bill for the Indianapolis schools that limits collective bargaining to the issue of wages only in that city. <p>	In neighboring Michigan, the state also erased collective bargaining over certain nonsalary issues, empowered school boards to put teachers' health insurance out for competitive bidding (rather than compelling purchase of this benefit from the Michigan Education Association's insurance subsidiary), instituted steep fines against teachers who go on strike, and forbade the union to deduct political contributions from teachers' paychecks without their permission.<p>	Such developments are apt to continue as long as unions throw sand in the reform gears. When education is reshaped around standards and performance rather than inputs and processes, just about every established routine will be affected, including personnel practices. No aspect of a school's management is more crucial to its effectiveness than how it handles staffing, and nothing is more fatal to performance-based innovation than attempts to preserve staffing rules that disregard performance.<p>	In New York City, for example, the contract with the United Federation of Teachers allows a school, if 75 percent of the staff agrees, to be included in the "school-based option transfer plan," which lets it (among other union-rule waivers) select its own teachers rather than having staff assigned on the basis of seniority. Sixty schools, including most of the struggling new, small high schools, have opted to be included in the program.<p>	In the city's 1,000 other public schools, however, which enroll 99 percent of the children in the system, transfers to vacancies continue to be based strictly on seniority. Junior teachers can be "bumped" by more senior teachers from other schools, no matter how much a school may want the junior teacher or how little it wants the more senior teacher. Such practices, of course, make it impossible for a school's staff to develop its own ethos, which is essential to the staff's effectiveness and its ability to work together as a team with shared goals.<p>	The Educational Excellence Network has had a long history of successful association on important projects with the American Federation of Teachers at the national level, and the authors of this report admire AFT head Albert Shanker's defense of high standards and high stakes, his international work on behalf of democracy, and his good sense about curricula issues. His staff has also produced some terrific products, and several AFT locals have pioneered (or at least tolerated) some promising reform strategies.<p>	At the state and local levels, however, far more often than not, the AFT and NEA are the most potent protectors of the status quo. In principle, they could change, abandoning their tired industrial model of unionism and turning to the flexible, responsibility- and accountability-seeking, participatory, professional approach to organizational behavior that modern organizations need, and that many other organizations have. We do not know whether, if only for self-preservation, they will prove willing and able to take such a step. We certainly hope they will.

<h3>Will Conservative Welfare Reform Corrupt Religious Charities?</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>Amy L. Sherman</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>	Welfare reform, says Governor John Engler of Michigan, is not "just about reforming a broken system, but about reforming what is broken in the human character." Engler is one of a growing number of policymakers who seek to shift responsibility for helping the poor from government bureaucracies to civil institutions -- particularly religious ones -- that can address the underlying moral and cultural aspects of chronic welfare dependency. Indeed, amidst the flurry of federal and state initiatives to scale back the welfare state, religious nonprofits are becoming the new provider of choice for funding and delivering social programs.<p>Engler has approved a multimillion-dollar contract with the Salvation Army to care for the state's homeless population. Mississippi governor Kirk Fordice has established a "Faith and Families" project in which state social-service agencies work with churches to "adopt" welfare families. The federal government provides some 350 grant programs for social-service nonprofits, many of them with religious roots. U.S. Senators John Ashcroft and Dan Coats have proposed legislation allowing individuals a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for donations made to charities, including religious groups, that serve the poor.<p>The enthusiasm for religion-based providers is well-deserved. Christian-based substance-abuse recovery programs, for example, reportedly boast a 70 to 80 percent success rate, whereas secular therapeutic programs report an average success rate of 6 to 10 percent. Research by Roger Freeman of Harvard University shows that black inner-city youth who attend church are 47 percent less likely to drop out of school, 54 percent less likely to use drugs, and 50 percent less likely to engage in criminal activities than those without religious values. Columnist William Raspberry of the <i>Washington Post</i> recently asserted that the most successful social programs "are those that are driven -- even if only tacitly -- by moral or religious values."<p>So it's beginning to look like th
e secular state wants some old-time religion. But what impact will increased state funding have on religion-based programs? Will more money allow them to help more needy people, or will it dilute -- or pollute -- their ability to exert the moral and spiritual influence that makes them uniquely successful? <p>In Michigan, where Engler has aggressively collaborated with religious nonprofits, the results are mixed. State agencies tend to treat these nonprofits not as equals, but as subcontracting functionaries doing the government's bidding. State contracts almost always come with conditions -- regulations that sometimes diminish a religious group's best assets: its personal involvement, its credibility with the community, and its commitment to addressing not only physical needs but spiritual ones as well<p>Moreover, religious nonprofits that contract with the state may, as a result, shift their purpose from the transformation of lives to the mere delivery of services. The most effective groups challenge those who embrace faith to live out its moral implications in every significant area of their lives, from breaking drug or alcohol addictions and repairing family relationships to recommitting themselves to the value of honest work. But state social-service contracts aren't mainly concerned with such outcomes; they focus on the number of meals served, beds available, and checks cashed. <p>
<b>Engler Calls in the Army</b><p>The aim of his welfare-reform efforts, Engler says, is to smash the entitlement mentality, promote the idea that aid entails responsibility, and empower the private sector (particularly the religious community) to deliver welfare services. To accomplish the first two goals, Michigan in 1992 began requiring recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to sign a "social contract" with the state that committed them to work, job training, or volunteer service for at least 20 hours per week. To accomplish the third goal, Engler has increased collaboration with and funding of religiously based social-service groups.<p>Some public-private partnerships in the state are still too young to afford solid conclusions about their effects. Nonetheless, the most formal and visible partnership in social welfare in Michigan -- the state's annual $9.5 million contract with the Salvation Army to assist the homeless -- sheds some light on the deficiencies of public-private collaboration.<p>In December 1991, the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS) awarded the Salvation Army a $3 million grant to provide emergency shelter and two meals per day to homeless individuals, either in its own facilities or by "subcontracting" with other private shelter operators. The partnership resulted from the expectation that homelessness would increase following Engler's most dramatic welfare reform: terminating the state's General Assistance (GA) program. Until October 1991, the GA program had provided about $240 million annually to childless, able-bodied, nonworking adults. Critics charged that without assistance, many of these individuals would become homeless. State officials wanted an inexpensive but effective initiative to prepare for such a contingency.<p>	The scale of this partnership is impressive. In the first year, the Army provided over 680,000 "nights of service" (a bed and a meal) to the state's homeless. The initial grant of $3 million has increased each year to reach $9.5 mi
llion in 1995. This works out to $10 per day per client and allows the Army a modest administrative overhead of 3 percent. From the time GA was terminated until March of this year, the Army and its subcontractors provided nearly 2.9 million nights of service to homeless individuals.<p>	From the state's perspective, this partnership has been, in the words of Rusty Hills, Engler's public-affairs director, "absolutely magnificent." In one fell swoop, Engler saved the taxpayers millions of dollars, dealt a significant blow to the entitlement culture, encouraged thousands of individuals to leave the dole and find jobs, and provided homeless people food and shelter far more cost-effectively than ever before. Despite the increase in homelessness that followed the GA cuts, state officials say, the Army and its subcontractors have risen to the challenge. Shirley Nowakowski, the director of energy, housing, and emergency programs for Michigan's DSS, says the Salvation Army partnership is a success because "everyone who wants a bed has a bed." Jerry Miller, the state's director of social services, agrees, noting that the Salvation Army is providing services far more cheaply than the state could.<p>	Leonard Krugel, the Army's director of divisional services and the point man in the Army's contract with the state, is also pleased with the collaboration. He explains that the Army would have had to confront an increased homeless population anyway, and having state dollars helped pay the bills. More importantly, Krugel argues that the partnership has provided the Army "regulatory relief." <p>	For example, city officials in Detroit recently passed a new ordinance requiring homeless shelters to provide, among other things, dietitian-approved menus, quiet study rooms for schoolchildren, and expensive fire-suppression sprinkler systems. The ordinance already has put some private shelter operators out of business, and critics say the regulations are excessive and unrealistic. But for the Army, Krugel explains, "all of [these reg
ulations] are outside the sphere of this contract."Just Send the Checks?<p>	Former Army staffers and outside observers, however, are less sanguine about the partnership. The Army has a long history of providing emergency shelter. But it also knows a lot about how to help the homeless break the cycle of dependency. Salvation Army chapters in Michigan offer drug rehabilitation programs, educational services, and job-training seminars. Nearly every Army center has a chapel on site, and Bible study classes and spiritual support groups are common. <p>   The state contract, however, is limited to emergency services only. It includes neither the practical nor spiritual functions that have distinguished the Army over the years. With state-supplied funds, the Army subcontracts with shelters and certifies that they meet minimum standards of health and safety and provide the basic services of food and shelter. The Army neither provides consulting services to the subcontracting shelters nor assists them in designing programs to serve the homeless. It simply acts as a conduit for state funds, distributing money to 116 shelters (including religion-based ones) throughout the state.<p>	The contract represents an enormous missed opportunity. On the one hand, state officials seemed to focus nearly exclusively on the cost effectiveness of turning over care of the homeless to the Army. On the other hand, Army staffers failed to insist that their emphasis on moral renewal be implemented in participating shelters.<p> 	"The Salvation Army has taken a very myopic approach to its role, that of being a fiduciary -- not a program monitor, just a 'pass through,'" says Dan Piepszowski, the Army's former director of social services in eastern Michigan who is now with the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. "I don't think the Army was able to fully integrate their church ministry agenda into the operation of the contract." Piepszowski says, for example, that there has been no clear ministerial role for core officers -- the heart of the Arm
y's religious leadership -- at the shelters. <p>	"They've got to figure out who they are in this collaboration," Piepszowski says. "Do we want to send the checks or do we want to work our magic? They've opted to send the checks."<p>	It appears that the Michigan DSS also had a too-limited vision of what it wanted out of the partnership. Leonard Krugel, for example, does not know why the state chose to work with the Army rather than some other entity. When asked the same question, Shirley Nowakowski of the DSS said that the state selected the Army because it has corporate offices in several Michigan counties. She seemed unaware that the Army, as a religion-based provider, might address moral and behavioral problems underlying chronic homelessness more effectively than typical secular programs. Neither did state welfare director Jerry Miller. He said the fact that the Army is a religious organization never entered his thinking. Rather, according to these officials, they wanted to ensure that every Michigan citizen who needed emergency shelter would get it -- and they believed the Salvation Army could deliver.<p>	Sam Chambers, the director of social services in Wayne County (which includes Detroit), complains that the state was never interested in a genuine partnership in which the Army could pursue its holistic approach to homelessness. "Case planning wasn't part of [the partnership]. Rebuilding people's lives wasn't part of it. . . . All that was bought by the state was direct emergency services -- a 'cot and a hot.'" Critics say the Army's involvement is not helping Michigan transform homeless individuals into productive citizens, but is simply feeding and sheltering a dependent homeless population more efficiently. All that has changed, they maintain, is who signs the checks for the individual shelters.<p><b>The Dole and the Soul</b><p>The drawbacks of state funding go deeper than the loss to welfare recipients of the benefits of a spiritual ministry. The nonprofits themselves risk losing their unique cap
acity to help the needy. For example, a nonprofit's credibility in the eyes of its beneficiaries may be tainted by its association with state agencies. Rev. Eddie Edwards, who oversees a community-development organization in east Detroit called Joy of Jesus, explains: "When we are working with people in the community, helping them become self-sufficient, helping them get off welfare, it would be extremely difficult to tell them to get off welfare if we were on some kind of public assistance."<p>	Other problems, though, exist largely because of the way public-private partnerships are now conducted. The impact of public funds on REACH, Inc., another church-based ministry in Michigan, illustrates several pitfalls into which such groups can stumble.<p>	REACH began as the brainchild of several lay members of Detroit's 12th Street Baptist Church, who started an outreach to senior citizens in the surrounding neighborhood. The group established a day-care center, purchased and rehabilitated crack houses, and even opened up a local restaurant. Rev. Lee Earl pastored the church, and REACH's offices were housed in the church building. As the group's vision for community renewal expanded, some members wanted to pursue government funding. In its early years, church members and private companies had financed the ministry's work. Earl says he was not sure that "the benefits of government funding outweighed the challenges," but his was a minority voice. <p>	In the early 1990s, the church won grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Small Business Administration, and the city government to expand its housing-redevelopment efforts and small-business training. But with the dollars came headaches. For one thing, bureaucratic sluggishness delayed their redevelopment program. Earl describes how government bureaucrats held up the processing of contracts because they lacked computer skills. "Their turnaround time might be a month and your turnaround might be a day," Earl says. "But you've got to move by
 their timetable." <p>	Local government officials overseeing REACH's work also lacked "street sense," Earl says. When REACH rehabilitated homes with private money, it negotiated only with the city's building authority. "The building authority was flexible to the realities of rehabbing," he says. "For example, the houses have to have gutters and doors and other parts made of aluminum. But you can't put that stuff on until the house has people in it, because the crack heads will steal the aluminum and sell it for drugs." Building authorities typically approved the inspection as long as the materials were purchased and ready to be put on. Once the home was approved, the family could move in, and church volunteers put on the aluminum within 24 hours. <p>	Once REACH received local, state, and federal funds, other agencies, including the community development department, assumed various responsibilities for oversight. According to Earl, the officials there did not understand the realities of rehabilitation in the inner-city. "They wanted [the aluminum] on the house before they would even come out and inspect it," Earl says. "They said, 'Put it on the house and we'll be out within seven working days.' Well, it wouldn't stay on the house for seven working hours!"<p><b>Up Close and Impersonal</b><p>	One attraction of religion-based social-service groups is that they tend to be more personable than their secular counterparts. Workers in the religion-based providers often come from the local neighborhood and can relate well to clients. Moreover, ministry staff are often volunteers or are underpaid; they are there because they view their work as a calling rather than a job. Nearly everyone in social service agrees that a friendly, supportive environment stimulates improvements in behavior among welfare recipients. Consequently, the "impersonalization" or "bureaucratization" of a ministry can severely undercut its effectiveness.<p>	The process of "impersonalization" unfolds in a variety of ways. Ministries complain th
at government funding brings enormous paperwork that steals time away from face-to-face ministry. In addition, government often dictates that groups receiving public funds hire only staffers with specific educational degrees, such as a masters of social work (M.S.W.), or with certification in professional substance-abuse counseling programs. Such "professionalization" can undermine the informal, relational style that once prevailed between staff and recipients of care.<p>	"Part of the criticism of us now is that we're too professional, too polished; that we can't relate to the things that [local residents] are going through," says Linda Smith, a REACH staff member since its inception. In the organization's early years, says former executive director Charlene Johnson, about 70 to 100 volunteers participated in various aspects of the ministry. Today, REACH's office "volunteers" number three -- all from the federally funded Americorps program. REACH's current director, Pamela Martin Turner, says the organization is "developing personnel policies, formalized job descriptions with job titles and salary ranges, and other things that happen when you become more bureaucratic."<p>	Gary Bayer, who used to oversee a Detroit homeless shelter serving substance abusers, argues that ex-clients who have overcome their addictions make some of the best employees. They have walked the same streets as the drug abusers they now serve; they have the authority to challenge them, and teach them how to get off drugs and stay off them. But under the government's credentialing requirements, such "homegrown" leaders often aren't eligible for employment as counselors.<p>	While credentialing requirements are appropriate in certain kinds of social-service work (no one wants volunteer "doctors" providing them medical care), they may be unnecessary elsewhere. In Detroit, DSS director Sam Chambers and his friends in the religious social-service sector are trying to design more creative programs with a greater role for paraprofessionals and v
olunteers. Unfortunately, such collaboration seems to be exceptional.<p><b>Organizational Drift</b><p>	At its heart, a religion-based service provider aims to transform lives. Such a goal can be difficult to measure by objective, quantitative data. That's why program leaders, when conferring with supporters in the private sector, typically tell stories. Progress in personal transformation is often judged by such things as changed language, faithful attendance in education/training programs, increased punctuality and personal responsibility, willingness to work, improved social relations with staff, reaffiliation with family, avoidance of drugs, commitment to financial accountability, greater reliability, and increasing initiative and enthusiasm. These often intangible and "qualitative" changes are the very ones credited with permanent socioeconomic improvement. <p>	Government, by contrast, focuses on objective statistics, usually to measure the number of commodities provided to a needy person or neighborhood. Consequently, nonprofits receiving government funds start counting numbers and recording statistics. And to ensure continued receipt of state dollars, they may start investing more effort in programs that produce easily quantifiable results rather than in holistic ministry that produces qualitative change.<p>	REACH's Linda Smith reports that the tone of the group's programs has changed. Before receiving major government grants, the ministry emphasized "human development," with great attention to moral and spiritual matters. "Our experience showed that if we didn't do this, we could move people into a house, but they'd trash it and not make the mortgage payments," says former director Johnson. Now the ministry's help is more "commodified" (providing people material goods such as houses) and its work is more project-oriented than relationship-oriented. Under Johnson's tenure, the ministry's largest annual budget was $1 million, distributed across youth, family, and economic-development programs. Today, 
the thrust of REACH's energy is on housing rehabilitation and construction, programs for which they can obtain major federal and state grants. REACH recently secured a $1.7 million grant for a major housing initiative.<p>
"Government funding will not realistically finance your Christian, holistic, or evangelistic purpose. You can't use it for that," says Virgil Gulker, a guru of the religion-based service community who has founded numerous projects in Michigan for the poor. "So you end up evaluating quantitative things -- how many houses did you build, how many meals did you serve, how many jobs did you find -- that will have no impact on your organization's original purposes, other than to diminish that original purpose or mission."<p>
<b>Secularization</b><p>	Gulker's insights touch on the crux of the issue of government funding of religion-based providers: the potential danger of secularization. REACH's current executive director, Pamela Martin Turner, admits quite openly that REACH has "evolved into a more secular, more ecumenical organization than in past years. . . . To some large extent, the work of the past was primarily based on faith, on a commitment to spiritual and religious values. Whereas now, on the staff level, there may be some internal spiritual value that compels people to come to work, but that's not the explicit understanding. People come to work because it's their job and they're expected to do a good job."<p>	The de-emphasis on the spiritual comes with a cost: REACH staffers are less likely to bring their religious convictions to bear in addressing, confronting, and meeting the needs of the needy. "We do not talk about the spiritual needs at all," says Smith. "When we worked out of the church, I knew every day, without a doubt, why I was there." Now, she says, "some days I come to work and people come in and I feel like I can't help them because they need more than to just talk about putting them in a house. It's a struggle for me."<p>	People of faith, of course, are concerned about the threat of secularization. But others ought to be worried as well, for the dilution of a ministry's religious distinctiveness may remove the very element that makes it so effective in addressing social problems. <p>	Even ministries known for their spiritually integrated approach are susceptible. The Detroit-based Joy of Jesus accepts no government funding, but financial problems led it to incorporate a separate, not explicitly religious, nonprofit partner organization called R-3 that solicits state funds. These are used principally in the organization's housing-redevelopment program. The ministry also moved its job training program to R-3 because private donations were insufficient to maintain it. Instructor Kevin Feldman reports that 
he used to integrate biblical principles in the training curriculum and pray with his students, but had to stop once the organization received government funding. In Feldman's view, the result has been that "our success rate has dramatically declined." Fewer individuals are completing the program and fewer are finding and retaining jobs. <P>	After reviewing this ledger of potential pitfalls, some faith-based groups in Michigan have decided that accepting government funds is too risky. "In general, there's a need for collaborative effort between the public and private sectors," says Joel Samy of American Family Hope, a Michigan nonprofit that helps the working poor. "But it's in the best interests of a church-based ministry to have minimal involvement with government at the funding level." Like Virgil Gulker and others, Samy worries that religion-based providers will exchange their original mission -- with its emphasis on spiritual awakeningfor a governmental agenda. <p><b>Exceptions to the Rule</b><p>	Although the problems afflicting religious nonprofits in their collaboration with the state of Michigan are serious, they do not seem to be inevitable. Some religious agencies have been able to work with government entities, accept tax dollars, and avoid the pitfalls identified above. If Michigan builds on these successful examples of collaboration rather than replicating its faulty models, then Engler's goal of transforming lives by cooperating with nonprofits in social welfare could be advanced.<p>	Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries (DRMM) provides substance-abuse programs and emergency shelter for homeless men and women. It enjoys excellent relations with Wayne County's Sam Chambers and has collaborated for decades with the county department of social services. Chambers has established a community-wide planning board, including several religion-based providers, to discuss policy. Chambers welcomes input from the religious nonprofits. These groups, he explains, are closer to the needs, more "user-friendly,"
 and less bureaucratic and intimidating. Noting that Detroit has 4,000 churches but only 33 welfare offices, Chambers says it is obvious he can meet needs more effectively by tapping into the religious sector. Such groups "do a better job because they tend to treat the whole man," he says.<p>	Aware of the church-state issues involved, Chambers says his evaluations of the religious nonprofits his department works with are "outcome-based." His office enforces health and safety regulations and conducts financial audits, but does not interfere with ministries' internal policies and procedures. There is no attempt to force groups to change their holistic approach or extirpate their religious sensibilities. Chambers says he works with DRMM because the ministry's track record is stellar: It has helped turn around the lives of some of the toughest clients in the welfare system.<p>	This partnership works not only because the approach Chambers takes is one of genuine, respectful, and pragmatic collaboration, but also because DRMM has a clear vision for its ministry and strong leadership. Its president, Don DeVos, says he'll refuse any government grant that compromises the ministry's commitment to holistic ministry. So far, it seems, he has.<p>	In Grand Rapids, Bethany Christian Services works with the Kent County Department of Social Services to provide foster care for at-risk children and residential care for abused and neglected children and juvenile sexual offenders. Its relationship with government is, like DRMM's, cordial and long-standing. John Cole, the program manager for the local DSS, is the ministry's principal government contact. Like Chambers, Cole takes a results-oriented and respectful approach to the partnership. Cole says he "doesn't implement any policy without first developing it in draft form and asking the private groups what they think about it." His staff meets with BCS staff monthly, and he meets personally with BCS leaders quarterly to discuss policy design and implementation. <p>	Unfortunate
ly, according to Cole, this kind of genuine and broad-based collaboration is rare in Michigan. He says that, despite the governor's strong support for privatization, most county welfare offices are biased against purchasing welfare services from private nonprofits. Because of the entrenched state bureaucracy, Cole explains, "There's a preference for county departments to provide their own services." And even when local welfare departments do purchase services from nonprofits, they do not do so as part of a broad, genuine, partnership. "They may purchase services but I don't think they really believe that that's the way they ought to go. I've been in meetings where they [government officials] are very critical of the [private] agencies," Cole says. And at the state level, he says, "the arrangements are very much businesslike and one-sided," even "adversarial" at times.<p><b>Redefining the Relationship</b><p>	Some of the most fruitful state collaborations with religion-based social welfare groups in Michigan appear to rest largely on the goodwill of certain government officials who treat nonprofits as equals and are more interested in enabling religiously based organizations to transform lives than they are in rigorously enforcing a church-state divide. This is a shaky foundation for the partnerships, since such individuals could be replaced by less sympathetic officials. Clearly, a stronger foundation for public-private partnerships is needed. And it must be built soon, before, in our zeal for welfare reform and "devolution," a whole superstructure of arrangements between government and nonprofits is erected. <p>	Some religiously rooted groups will, of course, continue to avoid any involvement with state contracts as they offer help to the needy, and their effectiveness bolsters the case for others to do likewise. But some ministries believe that relying on public funds through state and federal agencies is desirable and potentially beneficial. My investigation into private non-profits in Michigan suggests s
everal steps that both government and faith-based providers could take to guard the integrity of groups that seek out government grants and contracts.<p>	To start, state lawmakers and agency officials need to listen more attentively to the good Samaritans on the front lines. When big government imperiously issues decrees from on high, its private "partners" bust their budgets trying to conform. Genuine collaboration would mean, at best, that ministries would have some say in designing the regulations. Or, at least, that government entities would allow their grassroots partners flexibility in achieving the intentions of the regulations, if not the letter of the law. Otherwise, "working together" means that ministries accomplish less with the "help" they receive from government than they would have in the absence of a state contract.<p>	Politicians must redefine "public-private partnership" to go beyond the "delivery system" model, which is principally concerned with saving money, not transforming lives. In this model, the state decides what services will be offered and then pays private groups to deliver them. Some recent initiatives by Engler suggest he is on the right track. For example, Engler's "Clergy Summit" in October shows an awareness not only of the cost-effectiveness of outreach by the religious community, but also of that community's moral authority in low-income neighborhoods. At the meeting, state officials are expected to solicit the help of pastors in publicizing welfare services. Says an Engler spokesman, "If we can tap into the moral authority and trust that the pastors have, we are much more likely to reach people than if we just hope that some bureaucratic edict from the impersonal state government is suddenly going to make things happen." Absolutely right.<p>	In addition, state officials are now discussing how to broaden their arrangement with the Salvation Army. Social service director Jerry Miller says the state now recognizes the partnership should go beyond the provision of emergency 
services: "We need to work to get [the homeless] into transitional housing" -- and, eventually, permanently off the streets. It remains to be seen whether the Army can conduct this additional work in a way that takes full advantage of its strengths as a religion-based provider of social services.<p>	The Engler administration can go even further. It can hold up the work of officials like Sam Chambers and John Cole as examples of a smart way to develop genuine, effective partnerships with religious organizations. It's not enough for Engler to praise collaboration with these nonprofits. His administration must clearly define the kind of collaboration that is desirable -- and it should look more like the partnership between Wayne County and the Detroit Rescue Mission than the current partnership between Lansing and the Salvation Army.<p>Finally, government officials must acknowledge the value of a religion-based, holistic approach to serving the needy, and take the necessary actions to ensure that ministries agreeing to work with the state do not thereby stumble into the traps discussed. The government welfare system has failed, not only because it is a poor deliverer of the standard package of welfare benefits, but because the package itself is flawed. Cash and commodities are not the things that transform poor people's lives. Religious welfare providers have a better record in changing lives not only because they deliver services more effectively, but because their services are different. They provide "goods" like love, emotional support, spiritual instruction, trust, accountability, moral authority, hope, character training, and basic life skillsall in the context of personal relationships with the poor. They suffer with and walk alongside needy people until those people are able to walk out of the underclass.<p>	Any arrangement with state agencies that fails to give this level of autonomy to religiously grounded outreach efforts may serve the interests of government bureaucrats or certain activists for the 
poor. But it will not, in the long run, help the needy to help themselves.<p><b>AMY L. SHERMAN</B>, <i>a visiting fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, is writing a book on urban ministry</i>.

John, 10, is one of America's children who waits. He waits for
a home, and he has been waiting nearly all of his life. When John
was a toddler, his drug-addicted mom lost her parental rights,
and claimed not to know who the father was. John has been legally
free to be adopted since he was three, but instead has lived in
state-run foster homes and group homes. While his childhood slips
away, John's social workers debate his best interests and the
programs they hope will address them. But this skinny kid who
loves baseball knows better: &quot;I'm all wrapped up in programs,&quot;
he says. &quot;What I need is a mom.&quot;  

<P>Across the country,
there are 50,000 foster children like John, who no longer live
with their mother or father and have been declared by courts as
free to be adopted, but who languish for months or years in state-run,
state-funded substitute care. On any given day, nearly 400,000
other children-none of them eligible for adoption-can be found
in government foster homes, group homes, and shelters. Many of
them are kept there by absentee parents clinging to the legal rights
to their children. 

<P>Foster care and adoption in America have sunk
to a state of near-catastrophe. 

<P>
According to the American Public
Welfare Association, the population of children in substitute
care is growing 33 times faster than the U.S. child population
in general. During each of the past 10 years, more children have
entered the system than exited. Every year, 15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot;
from foster care by turning 18 with no permanent family; 40 percent
of all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare, according
to the American Civil Liberties Union.  

<P>
What was for most of America's
history an entirely private endeavor has become a massive, inefficient
government system. State agencies consistently fail to recruit
enough families for the children eligible for adoption every year;
potential parents often are turned down because of racial considerations,
or turned off by protracted and unnecessary waiting periods; cumbersome
state regulations extend to private adoption agencies and can
even prohibit private attorneys from handling adoptions. The result
is that tens of thousands of children are now free to be adopted
but have nowhere to go. 

<P>
This is the dirty little secret of the
welfare state: Every child is adoptable, and there are waiting
lists of families ready to take in even the most emotionally troubled
and physically handicapped children. Government adoption policies
are utterly failing in their most basic purpose-to quickly place
children who are free to be adopted into permanent homes. 

<P>
The
problem lies not with the children. What keeps kids like John
bound to state care are the tentacles of a bureaucratic leviathan:
a public funding scheme that rewards and extends poor-quality
foster care; an anti-adoption bias that creates numerous legal
and regulatory barriers; and a culture of victimization that places
the whims of irresponsible parents above the well-being of their
children. 

<P>
I can identify with these kids. I was a foster child
in a family that cared for 110 children. That family-my family-adopted
me in the early 1970s. Years later, as a student at Harvard, I
happened upon a book of statistics on children in state care.
I was stunned to learn that decades of research, policymaking,
and government funding had only intensified the system's failures.
I was one of the lucky ones, but luck will not stem the tide of
parentless children. By the year 2000, well over a million children
will enter foster care, and tens of thousands of kids will become
eligible for adoption. Unless the government apparatus of foster
care and adoption is dismantled, these children could spend their
childhoods wishing for what most people take for granted: stability,
a family that will last longer than a few months, a last name.

<P><CENTER><B>Subsidizing</B></CENTER><BR>
Failure For years the rallying cry of many children's activists
has been: &quot;More money!&quot; The National Commission on Family
Foster Care, convened by the Child Welfare League of America,
says that &quot;family foster care and other child welfare services
have never been given the resources necessary&quot; to meet federal
standards, and calls for a &quot;fully funded array of child and
family welfare services.&quot; When it comes to child welfare,
rare is the research article that does not call for more money
and further research. 

<P>
America already is spending $10 billion
a year on foster care and adoption services through public agencies.
Federal dollars now account for nearly a third of all foster care
funding, with most of the rest coming from state coffers. California
alone spends at least $635 million a year on substitute care;
the District of Columbia spent $53 million last year on a system
that was so poorly run it recently was taken over by a federal
court. 

<P>
According to the ACLU, a year in foster care costs about
$17,500 per child, including per-child payments to foster families
and administrative costs of child welfare agencies. That does
not include counseling and treatment programs for biological parents
or foster parent recruitment and training. The <I>San Francisco
Chronicle</I> reports that per-child costs for foster home or
group home care have increased more than fourfold in the past
decade. 

<P>
The problem with foster care is not the level of government
spending, it is the structure of that spending. The funding system
gives child-welfare bureaucracies incentives to keep even free-to-be-adopted
kids in state care. State-social-service agencies are neither
rewarded for helping children find adoptive homes nor penalized
for failing to do so in a reasonable amount of time. There is
no financial incentive to recruit adoptive families. And as more
children enter the system, so does the tax money to support them
in substitute care.  

<P>
By contrast, private adoption agencies are
paid to find suitable families quickly, even if it means going
out of state. The public social-service bureaucracy, nearly overwhelmed
by other urban problems, has little to gain by devoting extra
resources to adoption. Private adoption agencies are free to focus
on finding homes for kids and are financially motivated to do
so. Private adoption agencies are paid according to the number
of successful placements; public agencies, in a sense, are paid
for the number of children they prevent from being adopted. 

<P>
There
is a similar reward for foster parents to keep kids in state care.
By law, adoption subsidies cannot exceed foster care payments,
and in practice they are almost always lower. According to the
National Foster Parent Association, foster families in 1993 received
anywhere from $200 to $530 a month for each child under age 10,
plus additional money from states and counties. The subsidies
are tax free, and foster parents receive more money as the children
under their care get older. So the longer the system fails to
find permanent homes for kids, the more money flows to those fostering.


<P>
In some states, payments to foster parents caring for four kids
equal the after-tax income of a $35,000-a-year job. The money
is tax free. It doesn't take much imagination to see that paying
people to parent can lead to mischief. Parents are not held accountable
for how they spend their federal and state allocations; for too
many foster parents, the children in their homes are reduced to
mere income streams. If foster parents don't wish to adopt the
children under their care, what incentive do they have to alert
other parents hoping to adopt?  

<P>
Let me be very clear: There are
many dedicated and compassionate people in the foster care system,
serving as case workers, counselors, and foster parents. My own
experience in foster care was a positive one. But I have seen
and heard of too many that were heartbreaking failures.

<P><CENTER><B>Special-Needs
Stigma</B></CENTER><BR>
I have heard perhaps a thousand times that the children
who wait cannot be adopted because they have &quot;special needs.&quot;
Of course they do-they need parents. They require love and nurturing
that endures. But the &quot;special needs&quot; referred to by
advocates come with federal dollars attached. In 1980, Congress
started offering states matching funds to assist the adoption
of children with special needs, which included children of various
ages, ethnic backgrounds, and those with severe mental and physical
handicaps who may require expensive care. The subsidy was to become
available only after a state determined that it could not reasonably
expect to place a child without it. 

<P>
As with so many other federal
subsidies, states quickly expanded their slice of the government
pie by broadening the criteria for receiving money. Today, nearly
two- thirds of all foster children qualify. In some states, special-needs
children include kids who have a sibling; are black, biracial,
Hispanic, or Native American; are &quot;older,&quot; as defined
by the state; or have been in foster care longer than 18 months.


<P>
Two leading adoption organizations report that there are no national
figures available that break down the type of need, or indicate
the number of children who have physical or emotional handicaps
that would require extra expenses by their new parents. This leaves
the door wide open to all sorts of graft and fiscal abuse.  

<P>But
there are other unintended and unconscionable consequences of
this masquerade. One is that the needs of very vulnerable children
are downplayed. The plight of a teen-age girl in a wheelchair
who requires constant attention is trivialized when she is included
in the same group as children whose &quot;needs&quot; are that
they are eight years old. Another result-one I see often-is that
local social-services departments discourage families from adopting
by telling them, &quot;Oh, these kids aren't for you. We only
have <I>special-needs</I> children.&quot; This emphasis on kids
with the most challenging emotional and physical handicaps unwittingly
contributes to the false notion that foster children are &quot;unadoptable.&quot;
Ironically, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980
that established special-needs matching funds warned that children
must not be &quot;routinely classified as 'hard-to-place.'&quot;
Government funding has had just that effect, and it is helping
to delay the placement of children ready for adoption.  

<P>
I am convinced
that the entire incentive structure for foster care and public
agency adoption helps perpetuate the system's failure. It is a
failure rooted in the notion that government funding is the panacea
for family disintegration. The National Commission on Family Foster
Care claims the foster care crisis is &quot;the logical result
of two decades of national neglect in providing funding and services
for children, youths, and their families.&quot; On the contrary,
as long as these children come with tax money attached-with little
in the way of accountability-those invested in perpetuating the
system will do little to reform it. As one foster child put it:
&quot;Everywhere I go, somebody gets money to keep me from having
a mom and dad.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Anti-Adoption Bias</B></CENTER><BR>  
Government funding schemes
and inefficiencies that prevent adoption exist within a larger
framework: a steadily growing bias against adoption. Despite all
the sociological evidence of the benefits of adoption, the conviction
that a child does best in a permanent, loving, and stable home
is all but missing from the ethos of state-run substitute care.
How can this be? 

<P>
In both the popular and elite media, a deep suspicion
of adoption is all too evident. Marvin Olasky, a professor at
the University of Texas at Austin, has noted that a New York Times
series on adoption included such headlines as &quot;The Ties that
Traumatize&quot; and &quot;Adoption is Getting Some Harder Looks.&quot;
And what do <I>Playboy</I>, <I>Mirabella</I>, and <I>Good Housekeeping
</I>have in common? As Olasky says, each has joined the offensive
with an article that warns readers against the &quot;distasteful
&#133; bartering of lives&quot; that supposedly is adoption. 

<P>
Television
writers would have us believe that adoption has no happy endings.
TV portrays adoption as shady, risky, and shameful. Over the last
year, a dozen programs featured adoption in their plots, and in
every case the adoption agency was depicted as callously profit-driven.
The adopting families were white, middle-class couples who kept
secrets from the authorities or from each other. Birth mothers
were unfairly portrayed as selfish or disturbed. The programs
paid little attention to the well-being of the children. 

<P>
Groups
such as Concerned United Birthparents (CUB) help give legal expression
to this bias. CUB was behind the &quot;Baby Jessica&quot; case
that led to the removal of a two-year-old from her adoptive family.
Groups like CUB claim that adoption is a feminist issue, that
only the outmoded ideal of a two-parent family makes the notion
of adoption palatable. As Olasky notes, Joss Sawyer's book <I>Death
by Adoption</I> calls adoption &quot;a violent act, a political
act of aggression toward a woman.&quot; 

<P>
Perhaps more significant,
however, is the battle against transracial adoption that has been
waged by the National Association of Black Social Workers (NABSW)
for more than two decades. Its 1972 position paper reads: &quot;Black
children belong physically, psychologically, and culturally in
Black families in order that they receive the total sense of themselves.&quot;
Otherwise, the group claims, black children &quot;will not have
the background and knowledge which is necessary to survive in
a racist society.&quot; Our institute has received letters from
adoptive families in many states who have been barred from adopting
transracially. According to the North American Council on Adoptable
Children, state adoption laws may allow for race-matching, but
 &quot;their preferencing policy isn't written down.&quot; 
 
<P>When
it comes to transracial adoptions, there is no longer much doubt
that current policies are bringing the greatest harm to the very
community they were intended to help: African Americans. Just
consider the numbers: Though black families adopt at very high
rates, black children represent nearly half of foster kids waiting
to be adopted. Fifteen percent of all children in America are
black; but 40 percent of the children in foster care are black.
State delays in finding homes for black children, as case workers
search for &quot;culturally consistent&quot; placements, can keep
kids languishing in state care for years. 

<P>
&quot;These policies
are seriously harmful to black children, requiring that black
kids who could get good homes be left in foster care,&quot; Harvard
law professor Elizabeth Bartholet told the <I>New York Times</I>.
&quot;There is not an iota of evidence in all the empirical studies
that transracial adoption does any harm at all.&#133;There is
plenty of evidence that delay in adoption does do harm.&quot;


<P>
Such policies reveal a profound misunderstanding of the nature
and effects of adoption. To insist that successful adoption means
placing a child in a family of his  racial or ethnic heritage
is to overlook what every adopted child understands intuitively:
Adoption is not easy. No matter how much a child's family looks
like him, it does not alter the fact that someone gave him up.
Having the same skin color as the people in his household doesn't
automatically erase that. Only love does. As someone who grew
up in a multi-ethnic family, I find it incomprehensible when people
tell me that I cannot love my siblings the way I could if our
skin color matched.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Fallout</B></CENTER><BR>  
Attitudes against adoption, whether
racially motivated or not, share at least two flaws. First, they
ignore all the best evidence indicating that adoption leads to
positive outcomes for kids. Last year, the Search Institute of
Minneapolis released the largest study ever of adopted adolescents
and their families (see table above). The study, in which 881
adopted children and 1,262 adoptive parents were surveyed, found
that children who were adopted fared as well as or better than
a national sample of non-adopted adolescents in self-esteem, mental
health, school achievement-even the amount of time spent each
week helping others. Adopted adolescents were more likely to agree
or strongly agree with the statement &quot;There is a lot of love
in my family&quot; than were non-adopted children. 

<P>
Sociological
studies of transracial adoptions are equally encouraging. Rita
Simon of American University has conducted a 20-year longitudinal
study of transracial adoption. She found that such adoptions cause
none of the problems alleged by the NABSW. Rather, black children
adopted into white families typically &quot;grow up with a positive
sense of their black identity and a knowledge of their history
and culture.&quot; And such children, Simon says, often possess
&quot;special interpersonal talents and skills at bridging cultures.&quot;


<P>
Second, the anti-adoption movement fortifies the legal and bureaucratic
obstacles that are keeping children from finding permanent homes.
There are numerous state laws that needlessly complicate or block
the process. In Minnesota, for example, if filing deadlines and
other technical requirements of state adoption law are not precisely
met, parents can be prevented for months or years from finalizing
a child's adoption. Thanks to horror stories of baby-selling,
four states have laws that ban independent adoptions (though exceptions
are permitted). Despite this, more than 45,000 adoptions in 1992
were conducted through private agencies or independent agents-the
vast majority of them successfully. 

<P>
My office receives numerous
letters from people eager to adopt but frustrated by laws and
bureaucrats. One woman recently wrote: &quot;My husband and I
decided we would like to adopt a little girl, thinking we had
a lot of love, nurturing, and stability to give a child who had
been abandoned or abused. Almost immediately I hit a brick wall.&quot;
Her local department of social services-in a state with more than
5,000 foster children free to be adopted-told her it was &quot;not
taking new cases&quot; of families willing to adopt foster children.
A couple wrote that of their three adopted children, &quot;two
[had] lingered in foster care, one of whom we were not able to
adopt until he was age 18.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Adoptable You</B></CENTER><BR>  
There is at least
one other mistaken notion that feeds the legal and cultural bias
against adoption-the idea that many of the children in foster
care are simply not adoptable. My own experience suggests otherwise,
as I was an older child when my foster parents adopted me. And
my experience with parents in and outside the foster care system
tells me that every child is adoptable. 

<P>
For every child who is
ready for a permanent home, there are families waiting. It is
time to shatter the myth that adoptive parents are interested
only in &quot;healthy white babies.&quot; There are waiting lists
to adopt white children, black children, Hispanic children, infants
and teens, children with Down's syndrome and with AIDS. Private
agencies for years have found families for all types of children.
Adopt a Special Kid, a California-based service, receives more
than 1,500 inquiries annually from families interested in adopting
children with disabilities. The National Adoption Center maintains
a computerized listing of 650 qualified families waiting to embrace
disabled &quot;older&quot; children. The center reports that infants,
even the most severely disabled, are adopted almost immediately.


<P>
Outside of the thousands of families who have successfully completed
home studies and have registered with with their states, there
are no hard figures for the number of parents able and willing
to adopt. Certainly there are families who would come forward
if public agencies recruited more aggressively. Beginning in November,
1993, Massachusetts stepped up its recruitment efforts with public-service
announcements, an aggressive media campaign, adoption &quot;open
houses,&quot; and community-based recruitment. Such efforts helped
increase foster child adoptions by 47 percent in one year. 

<P>
Most
people know someone who has gone to heroic lengths to adopt. Americans
adopted more than 7,300 children from other countries in 1993,
according to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
The INS estimates that the 1994 figure exceeds 8,000. Others have
spent their life savings to offer permanence to a child; domestic
adoption through private agencies or independent attorneys can
cost more than $30,000. It is not unusual for foster parents to
adopt two, five, or even 10 children under their care. Clearly,
the barriers to adoption are neither the characteristics of children
who wait nor the parents who want to care for them.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Route toFoster Care</B></CENTER><BR>
In addition to the 50,000 children who today are
legally free to be adopted, there are hundreds of thousands more
who drift for days, months, or years within the state-run system-a
system that too often guarantees a parentless future for some
of society's most vulnerable members. 

<P>
Children enter foster care
for a variety of reasons. Mom abuses or neglects one of her kids,
dad is using drugs or is arrested for a felony, or perhaps the
parents are just having a hard time coping with the responsibilities
of parenthood. The American Public Welfare Association reports
that 70 percent of foster children enter the system because of
abuse, neglect, or &quot;parental conditions&quot;-including drug
addiction, incarceration, illness, or death. More than 600,000
kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute care, up from
434,000 in 1982. 

<P>
A profile of children in state care belies the
stigma that foster children are mostly &quot;unadoptable&quot;
troubled teens. Researchers at the Chapin Hall Center for Children
at the University of Chicago studied five states whose foster
care children make up about half of the U.S. foster care population.
They found that from 1990 to 1992, nearly 25 percent of all first
admissions to foster care were babies less than one year old.
Between 1983 and 1992, the proportion of 12- to 15-year-olds entering
substitute care in those states declined. The American Public
Welfare Association cites similar trends.   

<P>
Sadly, the youngest
children remain in the system the longest. The University of Chicago
study revealed that, after controlling for other factors, children
who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent
longer than other young children.  

<P>
The fact remains, however,
that foster care is failing children of all ages. The ACLU reports
that one in 10 foster children remains in state care longer than
7.4 years. At least 40,600 foster children have been in care for
five years or longer; another 51,300 have been in care between
three and five years. System kids, on average, live with three
different families, though 10 or more placements is not uncommon.
&quot;Every new placement is a loss,&quot; says Michael B. Pines,
a psychologist specializing in attachment disorders. &quot;The
result is that these kids begin not to trust anyone.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Paidto Parent</B></CENTER><BR>
One of the reasons that foster care tends to ensnare
children in a legal and emotional limbo is that its bureaucracy
and incentive system attract parents who are unable or unwilling
to adopt or help find homes for the children in their care. 

<P>
Whether
adopting through private or public adoption agencies, would-be
parents must undergo a home study.  Private agencies, which must
successfully place children in homes to stay in business, are
free to set higher standards for parents than public agencies
do. Christian or other faith-based adoption agencies typically
emphasize tough standards of behavior. But this is not so for
state-run substitute care. In many states, adults who fail the
adoption home study get a consolation prize: They can become foster
parents. Deemed unworthy to serve as legal adoptive parents, these
adults are then paid handsomely to raise children in state care.

<P>
Foster homes, group homes, and public orphanages share another
vice: Their government money comes with regulations attached.
This often guarantees confusion and conflict. Private orphanages
always have been driven by a mission:  keep girls from getting
pregnant, keep children in school, expose children to the Christian
faith, and so on. They use a combination of rules and rewards,
discipline and love to fulfill their mission. Often, this isn't
allowed in a state-run group home, where it may be against the
law to hug a child, or to lock the door after midnight, or even
to advertise for a married couple to serve as housemasters.  

<P>
If
a permanent, loving family is the surest route to producing happy,
well-adjusted children, then what effect does the foster care
system, at its worst, have on countless kids? The result of the
system's delays, incentive structure, and regulatory grip is that
many former foster children ultimately remain dependent on state
services. They are wildly over-represented among welfare recipients,
the homeless, and in juvenile and adult prison populations. In
Los Angeles County, 39 percent of homeless youth are former foster
children. In New York, 23 percent of the homeless were once in
foster care; in Minneapolis, the figure is 38 percent. According
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, former foster children make
up nearly 14 percent of America's prison population.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Culture ofVictimization</B></CENTER><BR>  

The financial disincentives to adoption and the
legal and societal biases against it do not exist in a vacuum;
they are rooted in the soil of victimization. More than half of
the children who enter foster care were abused or neglected in
their families of origin. But the current system grants &quot;victim
status&quot; to these parents. It often allows them to cling to
their parental rights as they move in and out of social service
programs. As a result, tens of thousands of children remain trapped
in foster care, never free to be adopted into stable, loving homes.


<P>
Take the case of Halie (not her real name), a two-year-old girl
who one day wouldn't eat her dinner. Her mother and mother's boyfriend
tied her to an electric heater. Hours passed, until Halie's face,
chest, and arm were disfigured. Her mother then threw her into
a cold shower, dressed her, and took her to a hospital-claiming
the child had spilled hot water on herself. After weeks of hospitalization,
Halie entered foster care. For the next 10 years, her biological
mother-coached by the local department of social services-maintained
her legal rights to the child. Case workers helped Halie's mom
to toe the official line to prove she somehow was still capable
as a parent: She married her boyfriend and had a child with him.


<P>
When Halie was 12, her case workers and a judge approved overnight
and extended visits between Halie and her biological mother. Halie's
mother rejected a judge's offer to regain custody. She didn't
want to raise Halie, but didn't want to let her go, and the state
gave her all the legal and financial help she needed. Halie spent
her teen years in group homes and foster homes. She turned 18
in foster care. 

<P>
Most states give biological parents every possible
chance to prove they are fit-while their babies grow up in state
care. A family recently wrote me about their two-year-old foster
daughter: &quot;She is precious beyond belief, and her parents
are being given chance upon chance to clean up their lives-at
her expense, as we see it. She is so adoptable by the right family,
but the system will keep her under lock and key for years if necessary
for her parents' benefit.&quot; 

<P>
In our social-work schools, counseling
centers, and government-funded research, the culture of victimization
insists that the most despicable behavior by abusive parents has
its causes in economics, racism, broken homes-anything but the
consciences and moral choices of men and women. We have devised
a foster care system that puts a vogue pop psychology ahead of
the well-being of children. This helps explain why roughly a third
of all the foster children who are reunited with their families
of origin soon return to state care. Indeed, it is the only explanation
for some of the bizarre attempts I have seen to reunite a foster
child with a parent who is clearly unwilling or unfit. 

<P>
Under federal
law, states cannot obtain federal funds for foster care unless
&quot;reasonable efforts&quot; are made to keep members of the
family of origin together (&quot;family preservation&quot;) or
to reunite the family ( &quot;family reunification&quot;). But
the federal government nowhere defines &quot;reasonable efforts,&quot;
and only a few states have specific statutes. It's a classic Catch-22:
Children are not free to be adopted until every reasonable effort
is made to return them to their biological parents. But almost
no one seems to know what constitutes a reasonable effort, that
is, what services must be offered to parents who need outside
help. 

<P>
When, for example, a public agency reports to a judge that
a mother has failed her drug-treatment program, the judge is likely
to insist that the mom enter every drug treatment program available.
So biological parents are given multiple chances to fail at parenting,
while children may bounce between state care and their family
of origin. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) admits
that the inability to meet &quot;reasonable efforts&quot; standards
is the primary barrier to foster child adoption. 

<P>
From my own experience
in foster care, the most difficult part was watching my brothers
and sisters return to biological parents who had burned or beaten
them, or put out cigarettes on their children's bottoms. I felt
like an accomplice. It must have been hard for my parents, who
could do nothing to stop it. 

<P>
Most foster parents, at one point
or another, must relinquish a child to a home situation that is
precarious. One foster mother of five years wrote: &quot;I have
been seriously reconsidering my position as a foster parent because
when we started this it was to try to help these children, and
I am finding out that I am not able to do that. The pain and heartbreak
of not being able to protect these children is a heavy burden
to bear.&quot; Until the system is reshaped, it is a burden that
every one of us carries.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Assignment: Adoption</B></CENTER><BR> 
It is one thing to
tolerate inefficiencies and bureaucratic delays in other areas
of public life-public toll roads, for example. Such inefficiencies
don't cost children 18 years of their lives. We do not need another
study, or blue-ribbon commission, or congressional subcommittee
hearing. When I was four years old, it didn't matter to me that
someone was getting a research grant to study the effects of foster
care on childhood development. What I wanted was a last name.


<P>
I am convinced that there are more parents willing to adopt than
there are children ready to be adopted. But the market for adoption
is frustrated by the regulatory system now in place. To create
a more efficient system, one with incentives to help rather than
abandon innocent children, we must get Big Government out of the
business of parenting. I do not mean we should create a market
in babies. I am not talking about baby-selling. I am talking about
serving babies and children by removing the barriers to their
enjoyment of stable, loving homes.  

<P>
Where parts of foster care
and adoption are privately run, competition and incentives have
led to better outcomes for children. In Michigan, where two-thirds
of foster care management is privatized, private providers spend
less per child, yet have achieved better social worker-to-child
ratios than those of state-run agencies. Adoption is, in fact,
the ultimate form of privatization: wresting authority over children's
lives from the state and allowing children to be free, to be raised
not by government but by parents.  

<P>
We must reform, state by state,
our system of transferring parental rights-from the government,
which can never be a parent, to parents who are eager and able
to bring these children into their hearts and lives. Congress
recently has taken interest in adoption reform by proposing a
$5,000 tax credit for adoptive parents. But will that tax credit
get children out of foster care more quickly? No. Does it stimulate
a market in private adoptions? No. Does it allow independent adoptions
in states where they are now outlawed? No. 

<P>
Tax credits might make
adoption a little easier for some parents, but they will not make
adoption work. To do that, we need reform at the federal and state
levels-bureaucratic reform that will shatter the incentive structure
that traps kids in foster care, and legal reform that will free
children who already have spent years in substitute care. In Massachusetts,
we call it &quot;Assignment: Adoption,&quot; a comprehensive plan
that our institute is bringing before federal lawmakers and state
governors: 

<P>
<B>Hold states accountable for reporting their progress
in finding homes for children in foster care.</B> Here is one federal
mandate that states ought to be obliged to take on. Washington
should require that states make publicly available, within 30
days of the close of each fiscal year, the following information:
(1) the number of foster children in state care; (2) the number
of foster children free to be adopted and still in state care,
but not in pre-adoptive placements; (3) the number of state-recruited
families with completed home studies. 

<P>
Most conservatives right
now wouldn't touch a federal mandate with a 10-foot pole. I would
prefer to see an entirely private system that includes a strong
charitable element. Until that happens, a few basic requirements
on the states are in order. We're talking about giving children
a mother and a father. And until we know the depth of the problem
in each state, until the number of kids waiting for homes becomes
part of our thinking and vocabulary, state agencies are unlikely
to change. There are people in our state departments of social
services who know these numbers, but we're not hearing them. 

<P>
<B>Prohibit
race-based delays in adoption.</B> Congressional attempts to outlaw
race-matching in adoption have yet to free tens of thousands of
children of color from foster care. This summer, the U.S. Senate
will consider a welfare-reform bill that prohibits race-based
delays in adoption. Even if Congress approves the bill, its impact
could be minimal. 

<P>
Recall that the Multiethnic Placement Act of
1994, sponsored by former U.S. Senator Howard Metzenbaum, had
a similar goal, but it was watered down. Under guidelines released
by HHS in April, the new law allows adoption agencies to consider
the child's &quot;cultural, ethnic, and racial background.&quot;
As reported by the Washington Post, the guidelines &quot;stopped
far short of requiring that adoption must be colorblind.&quot;


<P>
It is at this point that the discrepancies between legal precedent,
public policy, and social-work practices become painfully clear.
The HHS guidelines have not overturned any state laws requiring
that race be considered in adoption. And with vaguely written
state statutes, case workers will continue to have a lot of power
over whether a child will be adopted or languish in long-term
&quot;temporary&quot; care. 

<P>
Suppose every state had adoption policies
that were truly colorblind. We at the Institute for Children are
challenging governors to remove any and all restrictions to adoption
based on race. What would happen if thousands of children of color
grew up in white or mixed-race families? It would produce an amazing
generation of young people who, instead of growing up without
a last name or a permanent home, were raised by loving parents
in a diverse, multicultural environment. Why are some black leaders
so afraid of that? If their real agenda is the well-being of children,
then the evidence is in. Children are infinitely better off in
a loving, interracial home than as virtual orphans in foster care.


<P>
<B>End government funding that creates incentives to keep children
in substitute care for longer than 12 months.</B> Part of the problem
is that government money extends indefinitely, with no sanctions
enforced against  bureaucratic delays. The Adoption Assistance
and Child Welfare Act of 1980 required a &quot;permanency plan&quot;
for every child within 18 months of entering foster care. This
means that case workers decide whether to reunite a child with
his family, place him in long-term fostering, an independent living
arrangement, a group home, or make him  free for adoption. Adoption
is the permanency plan for 100,000 foster children, but no one
knows how often these plans result in permanent homes for children.

Deadlines for permanency plans come and go, court dates are postponed,
files are lost as children are shuffled among foster families.
A federal study reveals that children spend, on average, 30 to
42 months in foster care before adoption is even decided on as
a permanency plan. Once that happens, the state files a petition
to terminate parental rights; the filing can take another six
months or more. A report by HHS admits that in some states &quot;children
had an official plan of adoption for more than three years, but
no petitions had been filed.&quot;  

<P>The result is that in probably
every state there are children who have been in foster care longer
than 10 years. Meanwhile, the money to support children in state-run
care keeps coming, with no consequences to the state bureaucracies
that fail to place children.  

<P>
<B>Require that states find adoptive
homes for children within 30 days after the termination of parental
rights.</B> The foster child who is freed for adoption typically has
been in the system for at least two years and has had a permanency
plan of adoption for at least one year. Yet, as children become
legally free to be adopted, states claim to need more time to
find families for them! Our institute recommends a 30-day window:
If the state does not have a qualified family waiting, one who
has met the child and is ready to proceed with the adoption, then
state officials must contract out the adoption process to a private
agency. Qualified families exist in large numbers, and private
adoption agencies are pretty good at finding them. Three years
ago, Michigan launched a carrot-and-stick program with public
and private adoption agencies to get kids into permanent homes
more quickly. Since then, total adoptions are up, and the number
of black children adopted has increased by 121 percent-about 700
kids in the past year alone. 

<P>
Critics call this baby-selling and
claim that government should not act like a business. As someone
who has seen the machinery of the state from the inside, I argue
that government could promote children's well-being much more
effectively if it acted more like a business. I am not alone in
noting the failure of foster care management. The director of
the ACLU's Children's Rights Project recently wrote, &quot;If
the foster care system were considered a business, with its profit-and-loss
statements judged in terms of unnecessary human suffering inflicted
by mismanaged systems, in terms of misspent dollars, or even in
terms of how far these systems depart from their own goals, it
would have been forced into bankruptcy long ago.&quot;

<CENTER><B>Getting
Kids Out of Limbo</B></CENTER><BR> 

All of the above reforms are aimed at getting
the children now eligible for adoption into permanent homes as
quickly as possible. But there are more than 600,000 children
in foster care at some point during the year. Most of those kids
are happily reunited with their parents. Many of them, however,
become trapped in the state-run system-children who are never
free to be adopted, but who will not or should not return to their
biological parents. There are at least three steps every governor
could take to rescue these children from the worst effects of
foster care and help them find a home: 

<P>
<B>Make entrance requirements
for foster families as stringent as those for adoptive families.</B>
In the wake of a wave of child deaths in foster care, people are
beginning to speak out about the need to raise the standards for
being licensed as a foster parent. As one advocate put it, to
be a foster parent &quot;all you need is a clean criminal record
and an extra bed.&quot; People who have failed an adoption home
study can sign up with the state as foster parents. Foster children
deserve better than that. 

<P>
Critics argue that if we raise the requirements
for foster families, there won't be enough qualified people to
take care of the kids. I have more confidence in the generosity
of the American people. I think if you raise the requirements,
you'll see more foster parents and better care. Look, for example,
at private schools with higher requirements and lower teacher
salaries than public schools; they  continue to attract excellent
teachers and deliver a quality education. By maintaining a separate
set of standards for foster parents than those for adoptive parents,
we are saying to a half-million kids that it is not important
where they spend the most formative years of their lives. 

<P>
But
this is not the only disgrace in foster-parent licensing and training
procedures. In state-sponsored training courses, foster parents
are admonished, &quot;Do not get too close to your foster children.
Do not form a bond.&quot; Foster parents are instructed that their
main task is to facilitate a child's return to his or her biological
parents. From day one, good foster parents are discouraged from
adopting. 

<P>
Certainly there is a stigma attached to being a foster
parent-the system has created it. It is that stigma that discourages
many capable and loving people from fostering. If the entrance
requirements for fostering were as high as those for adopting,
foster children would be better cared for. The anti-adoption establishment
wouldn't like it, because it would ruin the standard argument
that foster parents are not adequate to adopt. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than
12 months for biological parents to prove their fitness to resume
custody of their children.</B> This may be the most difficult law
to pass at the state level, but it also may be the most desperately
needed. State laws can be so vaguely written and so easily assailable
that termination of parental rights is always a last resort and
can take years of court hearings. There are many in the field
who believe it is almost always better to send children back to
their natural parents. The Child Welfare League promotes the notion
that &quot;no one can truly substitute for the family of origin.&quot;


<P>
I agree that nature provides every child with two protectors-a
man and a woman-and that we're meant to be with our biological
parents. But nature didn't design women's bodies to endure crack
cocaine; it didn't design children to be shaken until they suffer
cerebral hemorrhages. Family preservation doesn't work in these
cases because there is nothing left to preserve. 

<P>
State governors
should take the lead in setting tough sanctions against parents
who neglect or abuse their kids. By setting a deadline for parents
to get their lives together-to get off drugs, get out of jail,
find a place to live, and even get a job or go to school-we remind
them that they really are responsible for their actions. But the
deadline must be final and incontestable; otherwise, irresponsible
parents will continue to imprison their children in a labyrinth
of legal battles and parentless foster care. The 12-month limit
has yet to be adopted by any state and is indeed a radical departure
from the years it can now take to legally separate a child from
unfit parents. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than 30 days from the birth of the
child for biological fathers to formalize paternity.</B> The &quot;Baby
Jessica&quot; and &quot;Baby Richard&quot; cases have demonstrated
the law's allowance for biological fathers who come out of the
woodwork to claim their children after they've been adopted. In
the now pending &quot;Baby Emily&quot; case, a little girl born
in 1992 was soon placed for adoption after the father's rights
were terminated for abandonment (he was doing jail time for a
rape conviction). But now the father is out of prison and has
sued for custody of his daughter. The adoptive family's finances
have been completely exhausted as the case awaits adjudication
in Florida's supreme court. 

<P>
Governor William Weld of Massachusetts
has sent to the legislature a proposal that, if passed, will prevent
such tragic cases in Massachusetts. The proposal requires every
unwed biological father to formalize paternity within 30 days
of the child's birth, and to maintain contact with the child and
provide financial support to the best of his ability-or forfeit
his right to contest the child's adoption. Ideally, that would
mean no appeals, no hearings, no state officials pulling children
out of their adoptive homes. The legislation, if not severely
amended, could serve as a model for state reform.

<P><CENTER><B>A Life That Matters</B></CENTER><BR>
A teenage girl-we'll call her Sarah-who worked for our institute
last summer was a system kid; she had turned 18 in foster care.
This was her first job and she was surprised when she noticed
that taxes had been taken out of her paycheck. She asked me what
the government would do with her money. In my usual non-partisan
spirit, I explained how the federal government would spend the
$300 withheld from her summer earnings. She actually started to
cry. She looked at me and asked, &quot;Will it go to pay for foster
care?&quot; She said it hurt her that she had worked so hard only
to help the government keep some other child from being adopted.
 

<P>
That's what the system is doing to our children. Though my own
experience in foster care was a good one, it opened my eyes to
the real hardships of countless children. My foster brothers and
sisters who might have gone back safely to their families of origin
too often and for too long were delayed from doing so. Others
lived the saddest stories of rejection-they had been burned, beaten,
sodomized or battered, left in a doorway or in a fruit field,
but later sent &quot;home&quot; to their abusers. Like foster
children everywhere, many who could have been adopted were denied
the chance to be loved and cherished by a family who would always
be there. 

<P>
Let's be honest: Adoption is no fairy tale. It is a
risk. Kids don't always go home and live happily ever after. But
every parentless child knows the alternative: the feeling that
there is no one to whom her &quot;case&quot;-that is, her life-really
matters.  

<P>
When parents adopt, they can accomplish something government
cannot: They can convince a child she matters. That's what makes
adoption such a great gift, an expression of unconditional love
and compassion. Don't we, as a society, owe that gift to our children?

At least 90,000 children have been in foster longer than three
years. One in ten foster children remains in care longer than 7
years.
<P>
The population of children in substitute care is growing 33 times
faster than the overall U.S. child population. Every year, 15,000
foster children turn 18 with no permanent family.
<P>
A year in foster care costs taxpayers $17,500 per child. Last year,
California spent $635 million on foster and group home care.
<P>
More than half of all foster children were abused or neglected
by their biological parents.
<P>
Fifteen percent of all children in America are black,but 40 percent
of the children in foster care are black.
<P>
More than 600,000 kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute
care - up from 434,000 in 1982.
<P>
After Massachusetts launched an aggressive pro-adoption campaign, foster
child adoptions increased by 47 percent.
