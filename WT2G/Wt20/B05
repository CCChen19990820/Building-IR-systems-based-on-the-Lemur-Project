<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER May 1996 </h2>

<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p> By Mike Fitzpatrick 
<p>Greetings,<br>
	Don't forget our member Auction of unused and unwanted computer and related items. Please try to be a bit early at the May meeting.
<p>	As you all know, SPACE has a web home page. If you have Internet access, it can be found at
<p align=center><strong>http://www.library.carleton.edu/space/</strong>
<p>
	If anyone has a color printer and could download a picture of what SPACE's home page looks like, that would be greatly appreciated.
<p>	April was a super meeting and it was nice to see former SPACE president Nathan Block.
<p>	July is just around the corner and it is time to start planning for our annual SPACE birthday party. Our ever faithful secretary will be starting a sign-up list.
<p>See you at the May meeting.

<h3>BBS News</h3>
<p>	Well the extent of the power company induced damage is: 
<ol>
<li>One blown 5 volt power supply for the 1-meg 800XL.
<li>One non-functioning Adaptec 4000A (Hard Disk Interface).
<li>Data corrupted on the main and backup hard disk 
<li>One shaky 14.4 external modem.
</ol>
<p>	What this has done is to force me to rethink the wisdom and choice of having 2 BBS's integrated into one system. At best it was always a bit unstable. What is planned currently is: 
<ol>
<li>Restart the BBS (done). 
<li>Rework how the user accesses the message bases and files based upon the internal security levels. This is in the process of being completed.
<li>Incorporate Sparta DOS 3.3B designed exclusively for BBS Express PRO.
<li>Best news is that the floppy backup of the sig_files is fine.
</ol>
<p>	Any former user who has not logged back in, please be patient and re-log on again and you'll be validated.

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting</h3>

<h3>Treasurer's Report by Greg Leitner</h3>
<p>
	Last month's Club meeting came at a good time for me. I was starting to burn out what with all the adversity health-wise my in-laws have gone through the last few weeks. My family hasn't had much time to spend together lately, and our leisure time has been non-existent. So I really welcomed the chance to make it to the meeting in April, and seeing and visiting with all the members in attendance really gave me the break I needed.
<p>	Don't forget the May Atari Club Auction next month. Nathan Block made a surprise appearance last meeting and sold off a lot of his extra hardware and software. It was good to see him again and he said he would try to make more of the meetings in the future. The Auction should give members another good chance of picking up some great bargains, so be there.
<p>	We had a slower month in software sales in April even though our attendance was great. We did have two memberships paid which helped and we even had someone contribute a dollar for coffee. Our total receipts for April was $58.00 and our only expense paid out was for the BBS phone bill. Keep in mind we haven't gotten the first quarter room rental bill and we haven't paid for the April newsletter as Mike Schmidt couldn't make it to the last meeting. Our balance now stands at $511.20 which is as high as it has been since last November. It would be nice to take in some extra cash from the Auction next month to help pay for the room rental coming up.
<p>	Well, the fifteen minutes I took to write this column is all the leisure time I can muster for now. Back to the grind, and I hope to see you all for the Auction next month on May 10, 1996.

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER June 1996</h2>



<h3>President's Corner By Mike Fitzpatrick</h3>
<p>
	I've been in contact with an Atari Club in the U.K. Their main interest is the Atari Portfolio Computer. I informed them that while our club intends to support _ALL_ Atari machines we didn't have a great deal of strong support for the Portfolio. If there is any member of the club who is aware of Portfolio support please contact me and I'll send you the U.K. e-mail address.
</p>
<p>
	Members Mike Schmidt and Glen Kirschenmann were missed last month. It was brought to my attention that Mike had some minor surgery. Here's hoping that a full and speedy recovery has occurred.
</p>
<p>
	The 1st ever auction was a success and the club netted a nice amount of cash. I expect the exact amount will be found in the Treasurer's Report. It is intended that we have another auction in July and September.</p>
<p>
	Speaking of July, don't forget to sign up for the birthday party. See Mike Weist for the list.</p>
<p>
	I need a volunteer to help with the entertainment for the July Birthday Party.</P>
<p>
	Again thanks to member Michael Current for making the home page for SPACE.
</p>

<h3>BBS News</h3>
<p>
	Well the BBS is back on-line (fingers crossed) fully. Any problems please leave e-mail with a description of what has occurred to you. The damage was more substantial than what was originally reported. The hard drive that was weakened did fail. The 4000A interface card needs repair.
<p>	The modem did finally fail. Fortunately, I had a 14.4 modem on my personal machine that is now on the BBS. The extra power supply starts out fine but shuts down when warm and/or a power demand is placed upon it.
<p>	In the past year there have been 3 hard drives fail; 2 interface cards (a 4000A & a 4070); two power supplies; and a 14.4 modem. This is a risk that seems to grow as equipment grows older and is used extensively as with a BBS. Replacement items are used.
<p>	Now the neat stuff, there is the start of a discussion on how to use the Atari Classic on the Internet. Also the latest version of Ice-T, an 80 column term program has been loaded on the BBS for the DOM folks to evaluate. If they chose not to use it will be placed in the general usage sig_file area.
<p>	In a discussion with Amos Jackson of WARP-10 fame and lifemember of SPACE, I was informed that the higher the level of PRO the greater the risk of incompatibility of 3rd party software such as f-mail. This has been or is being done by the current programmer, Steve Cardin, to reduce the number of backdoors into the system.
<p>	Thanks all for your patience during the time since the last BBS failure and restoration. If you haven't please re-log on as backup on the hard drive was lost when the hard drive failed.

<h3>Treasurer's Report bv Greg Leitner</h3>
<p>	Where can you get a computer for $8.00, or a disk drive for $2.50, or $200.00 of software for $15.00? At the SPACE Club auction that's where. If you happened to have missed out on the May auction don't despair. The Club has announced two more auctions for 1996. One will be held in conjunction with our July Birthday bash and another is scheduled for the fall, September?
<p>	Unfortunately the fishing opener and Mother's Day weekend kept our May meeting attendance down, and that kept the competition on the bidding at the auction from being what it could have been. Still, because most items were donated, the Club made almost a pure profit on the auctioned items.
<p>	Because our Membership Chairman was one of our fishing opener casualties we didn't have much in the way of software sales, but Terry did bring in some copies of the Disk of the Month and we sold seven of them. It looked like a great games disk and l hope Terry will make this disk available next month to those who couldn't make it to the meeting in May. We also picked up a membership renewal from the proceeds of the ST software that was auctioned.
<p>	Our total take for the May meeting including $69.00 from the auction was $105.00. Unfortunately we had a very large expense in May and that was the first and second quarter room rental which was $210.00. Along with the BBS phone billing our expenses outweighed our receipts by about $134.00 bringing our bank balance down to $377.46 for the month ended May 31, 1996.
<p>	Since we have the room rental out of the way through June we could really help our treasury by buying those Dom's and renewing those memberships, Also we need your support at the next auction in July. That means we need your bidding and we need more Atari items to auction off. Maybe we could expand one of these suctions to include items other than just Atari related. Come to the next meeting and give your input and support to your Club.

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting May 10, 1996</h3>
<p>	Space meeting for May 10, 1996 opened at 7:40 PM. Space club president, Mike Fitzpatrick, welcomed members to the meeting. Mike said the meeting would be an abbreviated meeting. He in-formed members that a software demo would follow meeting and auction.
<p>	Mike asked members if they received a Space club newsletter for May. Mike asked the membership to approve Minutes of April 12, 1996 and Treasurer Report as written in May newsletter. This was approved by the membership.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick talked to the membership about the Space club auction that was to be held after the meeting. Ray Wafer, a Space club member, asked if the auction could be changed to the Space birthday party on July 12, 1996 or September 1996 because of the lack of membership at meeting. Mike Fitzpatrick, club president, said the auction could continue in July and September to sell leftover auction items. Mike also stated that Don Langford will be the moderator for the auction. Members were asked to sign up for a bidding number.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick also asked membership to sign up for a potluck food item for Space birthday party, that will be held on July 12, 1996. A potluck food item sign up list will be on table by meeting room entrance this month and next month.
<p>	Terry Streeter, Dom Librarian, explained what was on the DOM of the Month for May '96. 

<p align=right>Meeting adjourned at 7:50 PM </p>

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER July 1996 </h2>

<h3>President's Corner</h3>
By Mike Fitzpatrick July 1996
<p>
	Well it is time for our annual SPACE Birthday Party. In addition to the feasting we will have another auction of computer/computer related items.
<p>
	The business meeting will be so brief it probably should be dispensed down to starting the feast and introducing the members who will be conducting the auction.
<p>
	For the feast: Please remember to bring what you've signed up for plus a little bit something extra. That way everyone can enjoy. Also, just as a precaution remember to bring some flatware and maybe a paper plate or two.
<p>
	The auction is basically the same as last time. You the seller must state if the item is to have a minimum price coming back to you or if the club is to get the entire sale amount. Also, any item that does not sell you'll have to take back as the storage space is <strong>REALLY OVER CROWDED</strong>. Lastly, to make things easier and smoother for our club treasurer, no payouts until the August Meeting; this will save on the nightmare of trying to keep the books straight. The rest of the sale protocol will be explained at the time of the meeting.
<p>
	Lastly, in order to help the dedicated few who traditionally cleanup, I'm asking that everyone pitch in and at least straighten up their area prior to leaving.
<p align=right>
See you at the meeting.

<h3>BBS News</h3>
June 1996
<p>
	Well the BBS is back on-line (fingers crossed) fully. Any problems please leave e-mail with a description of what has occurred to you.
<p>
	The damage was more substantial than what was originally reported. The hard drive that was weakened did fail. The 4000A interface card needs repair.
<p>
	The modem did finally fail. Fortunately, I had a 14.4 modem on my personal machine that is now on the BBS. The extra power supply starts out fine but shuts down when warm and/or a power demand is placed upon it.
<p>
	In the past year there have been 3 hard drives fail; 2 interface cards (a 4000A & a 4070); two power supplies; and a 14.4 modem. This is a risk that seems to grow as equipment grows older and is used extensively as with a BBS. Replacement items are used.
<p>
	Now the neat stuff, there is the start of a discussion on how to use the Atari Classic on the Internet. Also the latest version of Ice-T, an 80 column term program has been loaded on the BBS for the DOM folks to evaluate. If they chose not to use it will be placed in the general usage sig_file area.

<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>
<p> by Greg Leitner
<p>
	Among a well-attended meeting in June were a few new faces. At this stage in the 8-bit world it makes you wonder how many others are out there who may need to depend on SPACE for what information is left for their Atari computers. SPACE must make sure that we let Atari users know that we will be here to help them along their way in getting the meet out of their systems.
<p>
	It seems like there is still new ideas that pop up from time to time that keep our interest alive in our 8-bits. It was announced at the June meeting that in an upcoming monthly meeting there will be a demonstration of using our 8-bits to access the Internet. Come to the next meeting to find out more information about this development.
<p>
	Don't forget the Birthday bash in July and the auction we have scheduled with the party. The last auction in May was very successful considering only a few members were present. The Club took in $69.00 net at that one and we expect to do even better in July. Remember, we need items to auction off, so if you have any Atari hardware or software you don't use or need anymore, please bring them next month to the auction. Let me know how much you want for each item and we will do all the work in trying to sell it, and the best part is that you get your money and the Club benefits by getting any additional revenue if we can sell it for more.
<p>
	On to the treasury report fur the June meeting. We had three memberships recorded for June and also we had very good Dom sales. We took in $45.00 on the memberships and another $48.00 in Dom's for a total of $93.00 in receipts.
<p>
	Our expenses for June unfortunately were greater than our income. We had to pay $52.00 for the semi-annual P.O. Box fee and catching up on three months newsletter costs along with the regular BBS phone bill. Our total expenses were $118.72 leaving our bank balance at $351.74 for the month ended June 30, 1996.
<p>
 	Now that all our major expenses are paid until September, we have a good chance to pick up some ground what with the auctions we have planned in the future and the sale of our Dom's which seems to have picked up again.
<p>
	In order to accomplish this we need your support each month and that means you need to set aside time the second Friday each month to make it to the meetings. So I guess I will see you all in July, RIGHT!!
<p>

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting</h3><p> June 14, 1996
<p>
	Space meeting for June 14, 1996 opened at 7:35 PM. at the Falcon Heights Community Center in Falcon Heights, Minn. Space club president, Mike Fitzpatrick, welcomed everybody to the meeting.
<p>
	Mike Fitzpatrick asked if there were any additions or corrections to Treasurer and Secretary Report as printed in June newsletter. Hearing none, he asked both be approved as printed. They were approved.
<p>
<h4>OLD BUSINESS-</h4>
<p>
	Mike asked members to sign the Space Birthday party potluck list on table by meeting room entrance.
<p>
	Mike Fitzpatrick also said the Space auction would continue on in July at the Space Birthday party and at September Space meeting. He told the membership that he learned things from first auction at May meeting. Space club member, Bill Cotter, asked what he learned. Mike said he learned how to present and organize items for a auction.
<p>
	A member mentioned a TYPO- ERROR in June Space newsletter. He said it said May Space Newsletter and it should of said June Space Newsletter. The Newsletter editor, Mike Schmidt, noted this mistake.

<h4>NEW BUSINESS-</h4>
<p>
	Mike Fitzpatrick, club president, said that there were other Atari club newsletters available for members at meeting. Mike said he is in contact with Atarian from England. He said the new Space club HOME PAGE on the INTERNET is working.

<h3>Origins by Tony Walsh</h3>
<p>
	I am one of the original members of SPACE. I, Steve Howard and Chris Tiggerman started SPACE back in April 1982. At that time, TAIG was the only ATARI club in Mpls. TAIG meetings were in Chaska and they had about 150 members. We wanted a smaller club in the northern part of the Twin Cities. Steve, Chris and I were talking one day at work(UNIVAC) and the idea came up to start another ATARI club. But no one was willing to be president. The ball started rolling when Steve reluctantly volunteered. Chris volunteered to be vice president and I took the librarian job. We had several monthly meetings before we made the public announcement. Many people had expressed interest during those early months so we new the club had a chance to survive.
<p>
	One of our first projects was to pick out a club name. Steve wanted the words "Saint Paul" in the name. I wanted "ATARI" included. Chris liked the ring of Twin City ATARI Interest Group or TAIG. So we made a list of words and started trying different combinations. It seemed like magic as SPACE was one of the first combinations that everyone liked. And we also agreed that our "temporary" name would be reviewed by the general club membership and they would pick a new permanent name. For some reason, our "temporary" name became permanent.
<p>
	The first public meeting was in June 1982. I can't remember where the meeting took place - about 8 people showed up. After that meeting, we encountered some problems. Steve resigned and the meeting room was to small. That was a critical time as it seemed like our club foundation had vanished. Chris and I found out that Steve had volunteered, just to start the club and he had no intention of being the president. Steve was an author and he really wanted to write and publish the news letter. Out of nowhere, Ed Finegan stepped forward and replaced Steve. Ed found a new meeting hall on Lexington and Snelling - Minnesota Federal conference room. Our July meeting was a success with 13 people showing up.
<p>
	At our August meeting, we had 17 ATARI enthusiasts. Steve published our first news letter that month. And I started gathering software for the library. TAIG had 35 disc's of public domain software. I made a deal with Phil Seifert of TAIG to purchase there DOM and redistribute that software in SPACE. Ed surveyed the 17 members and found 8 had the 810 Disk drive and 9 used the 410 Program Recorder for loading software. That meant I had to build 8 DOM's and 7 COM (Cassette Of the Month) each meeting.
<p>
	The DOM's were easy to build as it took just a few minutes to copy the disc's. The COM's took a full day. I used 60 minute Radio Shack cassette tapes for the COMs. I wrote a basic program that copied all the DOM programs to my 410 Program Recorder. I would start a copy and return in 30 minutes, so I could flip the COM or start a new one. I was lucky if I got the job done in one day because the 410 Program Recorder was not too reliable. I also printed labels with counter numbers that approximated the start of the program.
<p>
	To load a COM program, you used the 410 counter to position the cassette. Then by pushing the PLAY button, you listened for a long silence in the tones. That meant you must have found the gap between programs. You typed in "LOAD C:" and waited for the computer to beep. Then you quickly depressed PLAY on the 410 and hopefully the program would load. The 410 was a "poor man's" loader and it was not too reliable. That meant the above process was sometimes repeated 3 or 4 times before you got a good load. It was near impossible to load a big program. And we found my 410 counter was different than everyone else so that added another problem. I swapped many COM"s because some worked for some people, and not others. What a time we had with our new toy!
<p>
	It was really encouraging to go to each meeting. We usually signed up 5 to 10 new members each month. And TAIG really grew - from Aug. 1982 to April 1983 there membership grew from 185 to 358 people. I don't have any numbers for SPACE - my guess is about 100 in April 1983. By this time SPACE and TAIG limited COM's to 5 programs per side because of reliability problems. And by now most people were using disk drives as the price dropped from $459 to $229. We charged $4 for DOM or COM. 5.25 inch disc's, in those days, were $2.25 each. ATARI 800 sold for $499 and the 400 went for $200. An ATARI 400 full stroke keyboard was $125 to $250. The 410 Program Recorder sold for about $80. And the 850 interface went for $250 if you could find one. My Epson, state of the art, MX80 dot matrix printer cost $459 and for $80 more, I could buy EPROM's that printed graphics. The Anchor Signalman 300 baud modem sold for $99. The popular magazines were COMPUTE, 250 pages at $2.50 and Creative Computing at $2.50. COMPUTE really supported ATARI and they usually devoted about 100 pages. They had type in software and informative articles from ATARI founding fathers like Chris Crawfort. All that cost put quite a drain on our pocket books - no wonder the wife was afraid of bankruptcy.
<p>
	I remember starting many "new" events. SPACE birthday parties, swap meets, paper library, and the 65K upgrade. In Feb. 1983, Steve Bergland figured out how to add memory to his ATARI 400 and I organized a 65K upgrade SIG (Special Interest Group). $85 got you 65K installed on your ATARI 400. Remember that up to this time, most of us had 16K machines which ran 90% of software available. Now my 400 could compete with those 800's with 48K. I think this was one of the first memory upgrades and it seemed we started an avalanche - all you saw advertised after that was memory upgrades. It did not take long for software to catch up with the 65K. And in about 6 months, all you saw was large programs and 48K machines.
<p>
	Looking back in my notes I see names like Glen Kirschenmamm paid $4 for Aug. 1982 COM. In Sept. 1982, Glen submitted COMPUTE type in software to the library. Sherm Erickson in Nov. 1982 was working with the mail order cassette library. In Jan. 1983, Sherm wrote an article for the news letter explaining the COM mail order procedures and charges. At the Feb. 1983 meeting, Sherm and Rich Mier were working with Prepie and cassette backup. Sherm and Rich also offered their computers and TV's for club demonstrations.
<p>
	Our club has come along way since 1982. Somehow, the club survived! I have always though the ATARI 400/800 are well though out and well documented computers. And they are a fast (machine language), 8 bit machines. They keep living on. I hope to see many of you at the SPACE meetings for years to come.

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER August, 1996 </h2>

<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick Aug., 1996
<p>
	The birthday party and auction went well; many thanks to all who helped and participated. A reminder before we move on: the next and last auction this year will be the September meeting.
<p>	Many thanks to Mike Schmidt for finding and making available to the club those new and unused 3M floppy disks for the Atari Classic. They are available to the club members at $1.00 per box of ten.
<p>	The August meeting will be a good one as two of our members will be demonstrating how to access the Internet with an Atari. Please remember (someone/anyone) to bring in a modem capable of handling higner speeds as the clubs modem as stored has ceased to function.
<p>	Our vice-president will preside over the session as my wife and I will be at our son's graduation and commissioning ceremony in Oregon. 
<p>See you in September and don't forget to renew your membership.

<h3>BBS News</h3><p> Aug., 1996
<p>	The BBS has been working well but I do turn it off during electrical storms. Lost a safety on the phone line when a surge triggered the crowbar protection device. It is back on line with no damage to the BBS.
<p>	Do have an apology to make: That being forgetting to restart the BBS after a recent storm.
<p>Not much else new; see you in September.

<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3><p> by Greg Leitner
<p>	The July '96 Birthday meeting can only be described as "awesome, baby". The food was great and plentiful and the turnout was even better. It was nice to see some of the "better halves" at the meeting to help us celebrate yet another year. Other years I had the feeling that it could be our last, but now I feel that this Club could survive many more years with the support I see we have been getting lately.
<p>	The auction was a complete success. The only change that was suggested is that we start the bidding at least $1.00 higher than the minimum bid. This would ensure that the Club would benefit on any item that was auctioned by at least $1.00.
<p>	The July auction actually grossed $254.00 and after deducting for the moneys due to the donators, the Club still netted $123.50. Even though the Club made less than half of the total amount taken in it was still very successful and the members got unbelievable deals to boot. Because of the auction sales and strong Dom and blank disk sales our balance climbed higher for one month than it has for quite a long time. Our bank balance at the end of June was $351.74 and at the end of July it was sitting at $475.52 an increase of $123.78. Our expenses were the BBS phone billing and monthly newsletter. Also we purchased some blank disks for $50.00, but this will end up to be a good
investment because we already sold $26.00 worth of blank disks and we still have a large inventory of them left for future months. When all the disks are sold we will make a handsome profit.
<p>	I am really excited about what the Club is doing and the direction we are going. The monthly Dom's are great and the members are supporting them. The auctions were a bonanza and the member who suggested the idea should be acknowledged.
<p>	I didn't fare to well at the last auction (everything I bid on was outbid by someone else) but that's great because the Club benefited and I figure there is always the next time. So I challenge all the Atari members in September to try to outbid me again because this time I will be more prepared for the long haul. And if I lose again I know the Club wins and that is the goal we are trying to achieve.
<p>	See you next month in August and I dare you to challenge me at the Auction in September.

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting</h3><p> July 12, 1996
<p>	Space meeting for June 14, 1996 opened at 7:35 PM. at the Falcon Heights Community Center in Falcon Heights, Minn. Space club president, Mike Fitzpatrick, welcomed everybody to the meeting.
	Mike Fitzpatrick asked if there were any additions or corrections to Treasurer and Secretary Report as printed in June newsletter. Hearing none, he asked both be approved as printed. They were approved.
<h4>OLD BUSINESS-</h4><p> Mike asked members to sign the Space Birthday party potluck list on table by meeting room entrance.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick also said the Space auction would continue on in July at the Space Birthday party and at September Space meeting. He told the membership that he learned things from first auction at May meeting. Space club member, Bill Cotter, asked what he learned. Mike said he learned how to present and organize items for a auction.
<p>	A member mentioned a TYPO- ERROR in June Space newsletter. He said it said May Space Newsletter and it should of said June Space neevslelter. The newsletter editor, Mike Schmidt, noted this mistake.
<h4>NEW BUSINESS-</h4><p> Mike Fitzpatrick, club president, said that there were other Atari club newsletters available for members at meeting. Mike said he is in contact with an Atarian from England. He said the new Space club HOME PAGE on the INTERNET is working.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick said Wesley Ringquist and Nolan Freeman will have a DEMO at the August Space meeting. They will demonstrate using the Atari computer in Atari Text Mode on the INTERNET.
<p>	Mike told everyone to show up for the Space 14th Birthday party at the July '96 meeting. Meeting adjourned at 7:50 PM.
<p>
Michael Weist, Secretary

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER September, 1996 </h2>
<p><IMG SRC="mike.jpg" ALT="M I K E">
<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick Sept., 1996
<p>
	The September meeting will be our last auction for this year. Hopefully the best!
<p>	September will also be the planning meeting for the year prior to the election of your club's officers in November.
<p>	We have a volunteer to be the BBS Sysop but the choice will be made at the meeting when everyone has a chance to voice their own desire, if any, to be the club Sysop.
<p>Hope everyone had a great summer and will be at the meeting.

<h3>BBS News for September 1996</h3>
<p>
We have a volunteer for the BBS Sysop job; Nolan Ryan. 
<p>If any other club member wishes to have a shot at being the Sysop please be at the September 1996 meeting and express your desire. To be the club BBS Sysop you'll have to commit to the following:
<ol>
<li>Provide a local call data line. 
<li>Provide a modem; the club's is fried. 
<li>Be a club member of SPACE. 
<li>Sign out the equipment from the club's treasurer. 
</ol>
<p>Being the Sysop does have some advantages: 
<ol>
<li>The club pays for local data line (no unauthorized long distance
	calls) usage. 
<li>You get the opportunity to learn more about your machine; the
	Atari Classic 8-bit Computer. 
<li>You get to write a newsletter article.
<li>You get to fix people problems on the BBS. 
</ol>
<p>Again, if you are a potential volunteer for the job of BBS Sysop please make you voice heard. Nolan has requested to do the job via the BBS but in fairness to all the selection should be made at the club meeting.

<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3> 
<p>by Greg Leitner
<p>
	I don't have much to say this month as I had to leave early from the August meeting to visit my father-in-law at the hospital. I got back to the meeting just in time to see the demo of accessing the Internet with our 8-bit Atari computers. All I can say is that it does work, but I understand you really need 128K to operate most of the software that's available right now. It was noted that you can access the Internet even as low as 300 baud. The 128K is a real drawback for a lot of us who only have stock 800XL's.

<p>
	Don't forget next month is our final auction for this year. Please bring in your computer related items to auction off. And don't forget that the bidding will start at $1.00 over what the owner wants. If the owner is donating the item to the Club for the auction then the bidding can start as low as $1.00. Let's make this final auction a great success. So far the Club has done very well with the first two auctions and it has helped our financial position considerably.
<p>	It was a rather small turnout for the August meeting and we only took in one membership renewal. Our only payout was $69.50 to Mike Schmidt for the wonderful items he brought to the last auction. I had the cash which I had collected from the auction to give to Mike at the August meeting, but since he couldn't make the meeting I decided to send him a check. So in turn I just deposited the cash. We only had $24.00 in software sales which means our total net deposit for the month was $39.00. Our bank balance now stands at $514.02 and that is the highest balance we have had since November 1995.
<p>	Let's keep it going with a good turnout in September and bring a lot of cash for the auction.

<h3>From the Editor:</h3>
<p>	The Minutes published last month were from the June Meeting. The following Minutes should've been in last month's Newsletter. The Minutes from the August Meeting were not posted by the time this Newsletter was ready for copying.

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting</h3>
<p> July 12, 1996

<p>	Space meeting opened at 7:30 PM, Mike Fitzpatrick, club president, welcomed members to Space meeting and Space birthday party. Mike said this meeting would be very abbreviated.
<p>	Mike mentioned 5 1/4 boxes of DD computer disks, unformatted, were available for sale for $1 from Glen Kirschenmann.
<p>	Mike Schmidt, club newsletter editor, mentioned he has Atari Iron on shirt pictures available for sale for $3.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick also said there are other club newsletters available at meeting. Copies of the Space club Web page on the Internet are available too.
<p>	Mike asked that the minutes and treasury report be approved as written in July newsletter. Approved.
<p>	Next month will be Internet night Demo. Mike Fitzpatrick and his wife will be in Corvallis, Oregon, so Terry Streeter will conduct Space club meeting. Mike and his wife will be back in September, at which time a third Space club Atari auction will take place.
<p>Meeting adjourned at 7:35 PM. Space birthday party followed.

<p>	Mike Weist	Space club secretary
<h3> Space Club's 14th Birthday</h3>
<p>	Well the day came, July 12th, Space's 14th birthday Party. What a sight to come into the meeting room and see a 30 foot long table full of food. Everything from a giant Tom Turkey, salads, chips, desserts, to Ray Wafer's famous potato salad, Bill Cotter's famous BBQ meatballs, Don Langford's famous BBQ smokies, and at the end a giant cooler full of ice cold pop provided by our treasurer, Greg Leitner.
<p>	The Space meeting didn't last long as reflected in Space minutes. About five minutes. Now I know why the meeting was abbreviated. Members had a chance to sit, eat hardy and do some Atari Talking. In all we had a OK crowd that attended the birthday party. We had a few people that stopped in that we haven't seen for a while. Pat Krehn and family showed up to help us celebrated. Nice to see you Pat!!! Stop in again!!
<p>	Absent was Rich Meir, Rich you missed a good party. During the party a second Space Atari auction took place. Don Langsford was the moderator. His assistant was Greg Leitner. Thanks Greg! The auction had everything from software to computer, printers, disk drives, and other items. At times the bidding was very intense. Money raised will go into the club treasury. I think the auction raises a sum of money.
<p>	The auction ended around 10 PM. Thanks is in order for the party committee, clean up crew, and for all the members that showed up to make another Space Birthday Party a big success! Hey everybody pat your self on the back. See you all at the August Space meeting.
<p>
Mike Weist

<h3>Accessing the Internet with your Atari 8-Bit</h3>
<p> by Andy Floyd - Re-printed from May/June Nybbles&butes

<p>	Many people hear about Surfing the Net and World Wide Web. I've even been asked by co-workers what all that stuff is about. "What's that thingy with the 'www' on those commercials?"
<p>	Well, not knowing where to start, I'll start at the very basic, gloss over some specifics for later (if I get the chance!), and give you some idea about what it takes to get Internet access of some type.
<p>	I will be writing from my own experience and from what I use regularly. If I leave out something or get something wrong altogether, you know what I know little of without being able to check it.

<h4>The Basics</h4>
<p> To get access to anything Internet, you need several things for your Atari:
<ol>
<li>Modem (well duh!) 
<li>Phone Line (Double Duh!)
<li>Interface
<li>Compatible Cable
<li>Software!
</ol>
<p>
So if you have your computer, disk drive, and printer, you've got that part covered. 
<h4>1. Modem</h4>
<p> Depending on the kind of access you got and what you will be accessing with your modem, the speed is somewhat important. The system I call is a local call, so 1200 baud doesn't give me too many headaches. If your provider requires a faster baud rate, you can use modems that are faster up to and including 14.4K and 19.2K baud. World Wide Web access usually requires a fast modem, depending on what you actually do. For Email messaging, speed isn't too important. If you call long distance, then it is. The kind of modem you need is External RS-232. I don't know of
any interfaces for Internal IBM modems yet, so External RS-232 is what you should look for. 
<h4>2. Phone Line</h4>
<p> You can use any modem over your own voice line, but you'll need to have some sort of extension cord to bring it to your computer, be it 6 feet to 25 feet. Modular. Nothing big here, but I thought it important. 
<h4>3. Interface</h4>
<p> Your Atari 8-bit can't use your modem unless you have the proper interface. And the kind of interface determines the maximum usable baud rate for your system. I'm not too sure which ones are the best, because I don't use an interface with my Atari SX-212. The Atari 850, the P:R: Connection (in any of its various flavors), the R:Verter, the MIO or MIO II, and the CSS Blackbox all interface modems to the Atari 8-bit in some manner. Not sure of which is better than the others nor their maximum baud rates. I don't have that much hardware laying around to find this out, so perhaps the FAQ on Usenet's comp.sys.atari.8bit (if I got that right) has that info! 
<h4>4. Cable</h4>
<p> For the P:R: Connection and 850 interfaces at least, you do need the proper cable. Standard IBM cables will not work! Mail order sources for this cable include B&C Computervisions and American TechnaVision. Again, ask around for their latest addresses and prices, as I don't get their catalogs all that often. 
<h4>5. Software</h4>
<p> You got the modem, phone line, interface, and cable. Pretty much got it connected, and you need software to make it work. Not really giving the specifics on any one piece of software, you need a good one with the handler as part of the package you load up. Bobterm is popular, and I use DeTerm 1.59 all the time. ICE-T is used for some type of text emulation mode. And there's plenty of others. The main problem with getting the soft vare for "modeming" is obtaining a copy to use on the 8-bit especially when you don't have any. Best thing I can suggest is to ask a user group or have someone mail you a proper disk with the proper working software. 
<h4>The Next Step After That!</h4>
<p> Let's gloss over the specifics of setting up and getting it working to: Where do I go from here? You go get yourself a phone number, hopefully of a local system that has the Internet access you want. This can turn out to be a pay system or a local free BBS which asks for donations. Even colleges or other public institutions can provide this for free. It really depends on where you live and who is the provider. In my area, at least 2 providers have outrageous prices for World Wide Web and homepage services. One at a rip-off $25 a month with LIMITED hours per month! But the system I use, Canton Communications in Canton, Ohio, has a reasonable subscription ate and is a local call. The WWW providers require you to have a fast modem and assume you'll be using an IBM. At least one does has ASCII screen interfacing capability. This info is from the advertising leaflets I received in the mail. But Cancomm provides the first level of Intemet access - Intenet Email - without limiting the amount per month I can access it. 
<h4>Internet Email? So what?</h4> This is probably the first and most important tier of Internet messaging access. Anything that can be found on Internet can be sent to your Email address! Anything! Especially Files! But you get an Email address. What does it mean? Why is it like it is? My Internet Email address is 'and 'andy.floyd@cancomm.com'. Let's dissect that. My name is in lowercase with a period between my fiat and last names. A lot of this Internet stuff is shoved through UNIX systems that use commands like "Is -I" to do a directory. These computers manipulate everything in a 100% ASCII (text) format and are very case-sensitive. Even though my system will capitalize a couple of the characters in my address. I enter them in lowercase or just hit <R>eply and I don't have to enter the reply Email address. The "@cancomm.com" is the "domain name." The ".com" is a designation to tell what kind of domain. ".com" is commercial, ".edu" means is a school or university, ".org" means non-profit organization, and ".gov" is a government designation. There's others, but these are the ones I know. So, reading it. I am "andy.floyd" at "cancomm" and it's a .com"commercial site. Anyone with the proper routing systems for Internet Email can send a
 message through the proper section and send Internet Email. The specifics on how that works goes into packet-switching and network technology, so let's just say "You send it, it'll get there." <h4>Files! How do I get files!</h4>
<p> One of the first things I did when I got a modem was to stay up late on local BBSs downloading games until 5 am. Nice and all, but I was limited to what I could get from the local systems. Now that I can get files through Internet Email. I can get anything from anyone, anywhere in the world! But.. In order to send a binary file, you have to make it 100% ASCII. This process is called UUEncoding. I don't know the exact reason for that name, but let's just say that when you UUEncode a file, you can send it in chunks and send it just like any regular Text Email message! That means you have to use a program on your end to UUEncode and UUDecode. UUDecoding is what you do to a UUEncoded file to make it a Binary file. 
<h4>Why all this Encoding?</h4> 
<p>Binary files, like programs, pictures files, and whatever, use bytes whose characters are not ASCII and therefore cannot be printed. Unix systems cannot deal with these types of bytes when sending text Email messages. So you have to pull the bytes apart and restring them together to form characters that can be sent as ASCII text. OK? And there are a few flavors of UUEncoding. UUE uses the IBM 'backquote' character, ASCII 96. This doesn't translate well on the 8-bit. Then there's UAA or something. This replaces ASCII 96 with the space character, ASCII 32, and usually includes a decoding translation table to tell your UUDecoding software how to handle that. And one becoming more popular all the time is XXE. This uses both upper and lowercase characters in its files, and is very popular on Fidonet. I get Japanese anime' pictures XXEncoded all the time, and fortunately with the XXE decoding table, The "Almost Fool-Proof UUDecoder" can handle these well.
<p>
Figure 1: XXE Translation Table
<p>
table<br>
+-0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST<br>
UVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

<p>It's just a simple 1 to 1 replacement to make a UUE or UUA into an XXE.

<p>One last UUE variant uses extra long lines. Some decoders can handle it, and AFP UUdecoder is one of them. It has an "S" at the beginning of the line. The AFP UUEncoder for the 8-bit makes UAA files. I have a couple of problems with it:
<ol>
<li>The lines have a lowercase "a" at the end. Some decoders use that final lowercase character for line-sequence checking.
<li>It uses the space character to replace the backquote. The editor for Fidonet echo mail I use tends to run lines together if I don't precede each line with a space. It tends to confuse people who try to decode my UAA postings. So I wrote a UAA2XXE program. Very short.
</ol>

<h4>After ALL That...</h4>
<p> OK.. My Internet Email access includes binary file XXE capability. That means if you send me an Email message, any length, with an XXE file in it, I'll get a binary automatically ready to download. I don't have to decode it off-line! Sometimes I get an UUEncoded file not in XXE format, and thankfully most often in chunks. Those don't decode and I do them off-line. And if you can find a automated mail server on a file site that will send you encoded chunks, you just have to capture or download them to disk, use a word processor like TextPro to put them back together in the right order, and save it all as one big file. My last gripe with "Almost Fool-Proof UUDecoder" and the UUEncoder is that it defaults to Drive 1 for all writes. I have to use SpartaDOS X's "SWAP" command to fool it into using the RAM disk for writing 
<h4>What about WWW?</h4>
<p> That's a different type of Internet access where you store files on someone else's computer for people to get at, like an always on-line BBS area. Sort of like an "off-site backup." World Wide Web also uses domain names. A "Home page" is an area on the Web. And any homepage can have a link to anyone else's. I don't currently have any access to that. Getting a system with UUCP routed, domain-designated Internet Email is the first and most important step. Actually, as long as someone can send you a UUEncoded file, you don't need Web access. And there's always someone willing to do that.
<p>
"Remember: It's "Internet". No 'the' in front of it. Internet is so prestigious, it doesn't need an article in front. Just refer to it as "Internet" and everyone knows what you are talking about."
<p>
"If you say 'the Internet' I'll know you are one of the clueless.'"
<p>
Just a pet peeve of mine. I &ltnever&gt refer to Internet with an article unless I talk about "the Internet Servers" or "The Internet File Archives." In those cases, Internet is a label or adjective. By itself, it's an entire entity with its own name.

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER October, 1996 </h2>

<p><IMG SRC="mike.jpg" ALT="M I K E">
<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick Oct., 1996
<p>
Fall is upon us and things should be getting back to normal.
<p>	At this time I'd like to thank Greg Leitner and his crew on their on-going inventory of SPACE property. They are doing a fine job for such a Herculean Task.
<p>	November is Elections of Officers. So please be at the October meeting to voice your nomination choices.
<p>	This month Mike Weist will not be at the meeting and we'll have need of someone to fill in as secretary. Please feel free to volunteer.
<p>	If you are wondering what happened to the September Newsletter. Our Newsletter Editor made a wise choice to not publish due to lack of input. Like everyone else I'm guilty. See you at SPACE.

<h3>BBS News for October 1996</h3>
<p>	Well the power supply (fan) failed the week of 22-27 September. Fortunately the hard drive power supply performed as advertised and shut itself down when in an overheat condition. Currently, the hard drive is being cooled by an external power supply and hopefully that will work for awhile.
<p>	The status of the BBS usage and future of the BBS will be discussed at the October SPACE meeting.

<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>
<h4>by Greg Leitner</h4>
<p>	We had a short session at the September meeting and a large group of members were in attendance anticipating the final Club auction of 1996. This was probably the hardest of the three auctions to hold as most of the items were software and very little hardware. But I thought it went well and Don did a great job as our auctioneer.
<p>	The Club once again did rather well from the auction and we netted $89.00 after all was said and done. Along with our regular DOM sales and one membership renewal we took in a total of $130.00 for the September meeting. Our expenses for the month were for two months BBS phone billing and two months of the newsletter. The two months were for August end September because neither Mike's could make it to the August meeting and we had to do a little bit of catch up. Now we are paid up through the end of September and the only big expenses we should have is the third quarter room rental fee of $105.00 due any time soon.
<p>	The BBS is going to be a hot topic next month so I would hope that all the members will be in attendance at the October meeting. Also, election time is coming upon us very quickly and anyone who may be interested in running for a position is encouraged to do so. I, for one am willing to remain Treasurer if the members so decide, and I would hope that the other Officers feel the same way. But if anyone else wants to run I am sure we would all feel encouraged that other members are still interested in what's going on in their Club.
<p>	Please come to the next meeting and help in deciding and discussing some very important Club matters. It could be very crucial to the future of the Club in how we want to support it and present it. See you all in October.

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting</h3>
<h4>Sept. 13th, 1996</h4>
<p>	Space meeting opened at 7:35 PM. Mike Fitzpatrick, club president, welcomed members to the meeting. Mike asked for a treasurer report.
<p>	Greg Leitner, club treasurer gave a report. The club treasury has its highest balance since November 1995.
<p>	Room rental of $105 will be due next month. Greg Leitner suggested that we have a club auction next year too. Greg said the club BBS. situation will be talked about by the club president.
Motion made to accept treasurer report. Approved.
<p>	A secretary report was asked for. Club secretary said he was unable to make last month's meeting. He said he asked for a volunteer to take over in his absent. No one stepped forward, no minutes were taken for August meeting. Minutes in the September newsletter are July minutes that should of been in August newsletter, that were mistakenly omitted.. Club president asked that it be noted that there was no minutes for August meeting. A note in next month's newsletter will state this.

<p><strong> NO AUGUST MEETING MINUTES TAKEN FOR SEPTEMBER NEWSLETTER------</strong>
<p>
<strong>OLD BUSINESS---</strong> None
<p>
<strong>NEW BUSINESS-</strong> An apology was made by our club president for a name mistake for person that is considering taking over BBS. Mike said that Nolan Ryan was interested in taking over BBS. The person's right name was Nolan Friedland.
<p>	Mike stated that total BBS. seems to be around 9 people. Is there still value to keep the BBS. going? If discontinued the club would save $300.
<p>	If continued by person that takes over. The person will have to provide own phone line. This will be discussed in more detail next month's meeting.
<p>	Hamfest will not be at Civic Center this year. The Hamfest will be at the University of Minnesota this year on the 26th of October. Having a club table at this year's Hamfest was discussed. It was decided that the club would not have a club table at Hamfest.
<p>	Tony Walsh, club member, said he looked at Michael Current's Home Page on the Internet for our club. To see the Space club home page on the Internet. Get into the Internet and type in http://www.library.carleton.edu/space/
<p>	Meeting adjourned at 7:40 PM. 3rd of 3 club auctions followed the meeting.

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER November, 1996 </h2>

<p><IMG SRC="mike.jpg" ALT="M I K E">
<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick Oct., 1996

<p>Mike did not submit an article for the Newsletter this month.

<h3>BBS News for October 1996</h3>

<p>Mike did not submit a BBS update for the newsletter this month.

<h3>Treasurer's Report by Greg Leitner</h3>
<p>
	Just a handful of members were present for the October meeting. With the elections just a month away I would hope that we get a good turnout in November. It's hard to believe that we have only two meetings left for 1996, and both of those meetings are a must for our members. In November we will be voting for the Officers for 1997 and in December we have our annual Christmas party.
<p>	You would think that with only a few members present in October we would not have much to report in the way of receipts. Actually we had a very good month and with four membership renewals and Dom sales we took in $103.00. Our expenses were for the monthly BBS and we had to pay the third quarter room rental to the Falcon Heights Center of $105.00. Usually our bank account goes way down in the month we have to pay for the room rental, but this quarter it only went down slightly. Our new bank balance at month end for October now stands at $530.80.
<p>	With the elections coming up next month and the Xmas party to follow in December, I would hope that the members who have not been able to come to the last few meetings will find the time to participate in the next two. These meetings are very important to the Club and should be to you as well. Let's continue to show the Twin Cities community that the SPACE Club is still alive and doing very well, and with your support it will continue to be the best source for all Atari users. Come to the meeting and let your vote be counted.

<h3>Minutes Of Space Meeting Oct. 11th, 1996</h3>

<p>Space meeting opened at 7:35 pm. Mike Fitzpatrick, club president, welcomed members to the meeting.

<p><strong>OLD BUSINESS</strong> - Mike asked for approval of treasury report and secretary report as printed in Space Newsletter. Approved. Election of club officers next month.

<p><strong>NEW BUSINESS</strong> - Mike Fitzpatrick asked club secretary to make a Christmas Potluck List to circulate among members for Christmas party. The secretary will do this.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick stated the Space BBS.will be discontinued as of November 1, 1996, unless a person comes forwards to continue the BBS. Mike stated BBS. usage is to low to keep the BBS. operating. Mike and his wife want to dedicate their system totally towards their business.
<p>	Nolan Friedland volunteered to take over BBS. This means he will pay the cost of the phone line and agree to BBS operation rules. On further discussion by the membership it was agreed that the Space BBS. will go be discontinued November 1, 1996 and the Space club will rent SIG file areas from Lance Ringquist. This will allow Mike Fitzpatrick, Mike Schmidt, Terry Streeter to exchange F-Mail.
<p>	The Space club's UPS and other equipment from the old BBS. system will go in storeroom at meeting site. Mike Fitzpatrick thanked Nolan Friedland for volunteering to take over BBS.  But he stated it wouldn't be fair for Nolan to pay out of his own pocket for the phone line. Mike Fitzpatrick also noted that the Flightline BBS. is stil around with Atari Net and Fido Net for the 8-Bit and ST. Club member, Michael Current, stated that the Atari Home Address in the October Space Newsletter is wrong.<br> <strong>The right address is----http://www.library.carleton.edu/space/</strong>

<p>The meeting adjourned at 8:00 pm. Mike Weist, Club Secretary

<h3 align=center>Attention! Christmas Party<br>
December 13, 1996</h3>

<p>	Well. fellow Space Atarians it is that time of the year again. Time to think about the club's Christmas Party. I assume that you all haven't forgotten last year's Christmas Party Alot of us were all ready in December, but Mother Nature changed that. Anyway we still had a fun Christmas Party, only it was one month later.
<p>	Last Christmas party we saw a few old members we haven't seen for a while. Plus there was alots of good food, fun, and Atari Talk. Mark you calendars for December 13, 1996 and come. Bring a friend and a potluck item and have a fun time!
<p>	For potluck items we will need, meats, vegetables, salads, chips, desserts, and beverages. So come to the November meeting ready to sign the potluck list. I hope to see Ray Wafer's famous pototoe salad, Bill Cotter's famous meatballs, Don Langford's famous smookies, Mike Fitzpatrick's cake, Greg Leinter's pop to wash all that good food down and other items. Oh! I forgot! Al Nobles' Special K-Bars.

<h3 align=center>Remember come to the Space club's 14th Christmas<br>
Party, December 13th!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h3>

<p><IMG SRC="mike.jpg" ALT="M I K E">
<h3>President's Corner</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick Nov., 1996

<p>	Well the elections are over and the officers have been elected for another year..
<p>	The BBS has been terminated and the club will be doing official business on the Video-61 BBS. The difference in savings will equate to approximately 5 months of room rent, where we meet.
<p> Don't forget the annual Christmas Party. It is still a pot luck affair and Mike Wiest had a great idea about calling prior SPACE members for the event. I did call three former members and they all agreed to put the event on their calendar. As with any pot luck please remember to bring what you've signed up for plus a little extra. Also please remember to bring some flatware and plates for yourself.
<p>	If you haven't already, please check out the SPACE home page compliments of member Michael Current.
<p>	Since the December meeting is primarily social please start thinking about what we wish to start doing commencmg with our January meeting.
<p>Hope you had a great Thanksgiving Holiday.

<p><strong>P.S. Don't forget this: <br>With really inclimate weather SPACE will be canceled</strong>

<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>
<p><strong> by Greg Leitner</strong>
<p>
	November 8, 1996, voting night for S.P.A.C.E., only a handful of members were present to cast their ballots, and the end result; no changes in the Club's officers for 1997. Now that wasn't all true, we didn't actually cast ballots, but we did re-elect the incumbants from 1996 to continue on for another year. If you were one of the few members attending the November meeting you know the election was not that formal, but it is still a very important part of the Club's function. If you were not at the meeting then you missed out on one of your privileges as a dues paying member. I would assume that if you are willing to cough up the money for your dues that you would want to get something out of the Club in return. If you have a suggestion that you could help to contribute to the meetings then please come and do so. It could provide a much needed spark or a put a new idea into action that the whole Club would benefit from. This is why we all joined, to help each other get the most out of our Atari computers and programs, but you need to be there to reap the benefits.
<p>	Next month, on December 13, 1996, we will be having our Christmas party meeting. It would be nice to see a lot of the old faces again. Please join us for a great time and don't forget to bring a dish for everyone to enjoy.
<p>	We have a lot to celebrate this Christmas as the Club is ending the year in great financial shape. Our balance at this time is $589.14 and grew by over $50.00 from the previous month balance. Since our average monthly expenses are only about $70.00 we only need a couple of monthly memberships and average monthly dom sales to cover them. Anything above this and it is all gravy for the Club. We are ending the year on a good note and with your support we should expect another financially successful year for 1997. See you at the Christmas party.

<h3>Minutes of Space Meeting</h3>
<p><strong>Nov 8th, 1996</strong>

<p>	Some items need to be refreshed for the users and general membership.
<ol>
<li>The BBS is not the property of the club. The club's hardware is inventoried in the storage locker. The software, table, and UPS are with the Sysop. There are those who have forgotten that the BBS was piggybacked to another system to save the club about $100 in phone charges when it was moved early this year.
<li>The SPACE portion of the BBS is for the primary use of SPACE members and secondly for all interested people who are interested an Atari Computers.
<li>There has been a ruggy war now apparently over where drastic measures had to be taken to diffuse the issue. Some users took umbrage to that. There seems to be threats being sent in e-mail; that will have to stop. As of the posting of this in the Newsletter I will start monitoring e-mail and delete any threatening posts.
</ol>
<h4>Ghost Files:</h4>
<p>	There have been concerns about being informed that there are F-mail messages when in fact there are none or less that what is displayed. Traced that down to botched or incomplete uploads where the file has 0 (zero) bytes in it and may not be displayed. Went through and cleaned out the file mail sub directory the weekend of 27-29 October. If you have a problem with ghost files please let the Sysop know in e-mail; Thanks.

<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>
<p> by Greg Leitner
<p>	Two members in the back of the room discussing the ST. Tnree members around the demo table practicing the programs on the current disk of the month. Younger members and older members' young children standing in the lobby engrossed in the game play of the new Jaguar CD system. Other members with computer hardware mechanical malfunctions describing their problems to Rich Mier in hopes of finding a cure for their machines.
<p>	All of this is what a typical Atari monthly meeting is all about and well it should be. This is where we can get the answers or help on anything about Atari, whether it's an 8-bit, 16-bit, older generation game system or a new game system.
<p>
We probably spend more time talking Atari on this night of the month than the rest of the month put together.
<p>	So I guess what I am leading up to is the fact that the Club is what every Atari owner needs to keep the fire burning. I know there are times when I really don't feel like going to the meeting, but after arriving I don't want the evening to end. The Atari may be dead in most people's minds, but we make it come alive every second Friday of every month.
<p>	Now on to the reason why I write this report each month. In October we had a good month for receipts. With the ice cream social and two membership renewals along with DOM sales we took in $104.25. Our expenses included the third quarter room rental, the monthly expenses for the BBS and the newsletter which all totaled $134.94. Our balance at month ending 18/31/95 is $460.00, and with the room rental paid until December we have a good chance of building our balance to greater heights. All we need is to have all of our members show up, especially now that summer is over and we all have extra time on our hands (HA HA).
<p>	Don't forget that November is election month and it's very important that every member is heard and counted. I hope we have the best turnout so far this year.

<h3 align=center>HEY! LET'S PLAN THE SPACE 13TH ANNUAL CHRISTMAS PARTY!</h3>
<p>	Well, it is getting to be that time of the year, snow and cold, and the upcoming Christmas Holidays. Which means it is time to think about the upcoming Space Christmas Party that will be held on December 8, 1995.
<p>	Every year the Space Christmas Party is a fun time for all the club members. And once in a while we have some surprise visits from former club members. The food is always good. The Atari trivia contests are fun too. The door prizes are great to win too. There is always a lot of Atari talk. It is also a time to look back at past club years and remember the fun times.
<p>	At the November Space Club meeting that will be held on Nov. 10, besides elections of officers, there will be discussion of the upcoming Christmas Party. Volunteers will be needed on the Christmas Party Committee to make sure the Space Christmas Party will be a success like in past years.
<p>	The Christmas Party will probably be potluck. Members will be asked to bring their favorite potluck item. I hope to see Ray Wafer's famous potato salad, Al Nobles' Special K- bars, Bill Cotter's famous meatballs, plus other food items. There will be a sign-up sheet at November meeting.
<p>	So show up for the November meeting to help plan a FUN Space Christmas Party for 1995. And if you see former Space club members, tell them to come to the Christmas Party in December.
<p>Well, see you all at Space meeting in November.

//// <strong>Swap Meet and Trade</strong>
<p>	In this column I hope to foster communication and support for 8-bit and ST computer owners . . . presenting a positive and directive
	approach. This will help to strengthen the users group base and encourage the executive element.
<p>	==If you have a question you would like to see answered, or a topic you would like to see covered; send me an Email!==
<p>	Seems that the Internet is continuing to get the media coverage. Using the word "Internet" seems to be a way to get people to read your article, magazine, or view your broadcast. Whatever magazine you pick up or news broadcast you view, the Internet seems to get some billing. All this hype is putting computers into the public eye more and more. Recently our local paper started a "CyberLife" section that focuses on news and information about the computer industry and our daily lives. I was pleasantly surprised to see an Atari Mega ST featured a few weeks ago in this same paper's Sunday edition. Front page of the second section was a picture of a child and his teacher working on an Atari Mega ST.
<p>	Recently the Computer Clearance Center in Boise sponsored a Swap Meet where all types of computers and electronic parts were bought and sold by computer owners. Local user groups also attended and had display booths. The Atari Boise User Group (ABUG) had a table. On display was an Atari 800, an Atari ST, and an Atari TT. The Idaho PC User Group (IPCUG) was in the next booth. I struck up a conversation with one of the people at that booth. He turned out to be one of the IPCUG's officers. We talked about computers in general, the Internet, and finally about Atari computers. He was rather surprised that
programmers were still writing programs that ran on the Atari ST. We walked over to the Atari TT and he was shown all the built-in ports. He was impressed to see Pagestream displaying the cover of the Home Computer News (ABUG's monthly newsletter) with the finished copy side by side. I think the fact that Paula (a mod player) was playing in the background (multitasking) also made an impression. He will have quite a different point of view the next time someone mentions Atari.
<p>	Swap meets are a great place for user groups. Both the people who show and the people who browse are always computer people. As a user group, ABUG wanted to make a good impression on the local computer community. For very little money, ABUG printed up some business cards with the ABUG name, meeting and membership info, their Web page, and the local BBS supporting Atari owners. They had back copies of their newsletter, TOAD catalogs, information on MagiC-Mac and GEMulator, running demos on the TT, ST, and 8-bit computers, hardware for sale, and members of the group manning the booth throughout the day.
<p>	A major advantage to presenting the user group at this kind of event is the people are browsing. People dropped by who had only hard of (and played) Atari Games. They were surprised to see business applications running on a multitasking system with VGA resolution. Many were interested in the technology. Some thought Atari had copied OS/2 Warp and Windows 95 and didn't believe that this 32-bit system was five years old. The ABUG members took the time to demonstrate software and explain the hardware. Many had never knew the Atari Computers even existed. It was an enlightening experience. It was fun.

<p>	Another advantage to being participants in the show was the interaction between others who were participating. Networking with other local computer people can be very beneficial. I talked with computer consultants, Internet providers, and other user group officers. After talking to the officers of another user group we came up with an idea to go to the local paper and see if they would do a User Group News column in the new CyberLife section that comes out each Monday. The idea is that each group would take a turn in rotation and submit a short "news and happenings" column about their particular user group. No one person would be burdened with a weekly article and all groups could participate and get recognition every month or so. I drafted a letter and emailed it to the paper's editor. (Only time will tell).
<p>	The swap meet is not as large as a trade show and few, if any, commercial vendors or retailers show up. It has some particular advantages. It doesn't cost much to attend because they are usually free. It doesn't take much to organize because they are usually just a large "yard sale" in a parking lot. Set up tables, run some electrical cords, send out flyers to local computer stores and user groups, and that's about it. Locations can be about anywhere. You can get a large driveway or the parking lot of a business that isn't using it on a Saturday. Often other user groups will pitch in and help with the setup and organization. It takes some effort, but it is well worth it. You can sell programs you have gotten tired of using. Old hardware components, even broken ones, can be sold or traded for things you want. It seems that nothing is obsolete and someone somewhere wants what you think is no longer needed. A swap meet makes that sort of commerce possible. (The ABUG sold an Atari 800 8-bit system).
<p>	Swap meets are great. Some of AEO readers are in small Atari user groups with a limited number of members. Getting together with other user groups and local retailers for a swap meet would be good. Most of us can't get to the computer shows where Atari Computers are featured. A swap meet is a way to make your own contribution to spreading the news about Atari computers... and helping other Atari Computer owners in your own community at the same time.

|              Larry's                |
|          ACTION! TUTORIAL           |
+-------------------------------------+
#15      A BIT OF DIGRESSION
---------------------------------------</pre>
<p>
Now that you have fully scrutinized the nifty routines I included in last months issue, you may have noticed that ShowCard was a function, yet used as a procedure. This is completely acceptable. When used this way, the value returned is ignored. You can use the ShowCard function to find out the value of the card. Aces thru Tens count as their pip value, while face cards count as ten. If need be, the card itself can be used to determine suit, in the same manner as ShowCard.
<p>
You might also wonder why the routines that were just a few lines long, were not
	simply written into the Main procedure.	
One reason is that Action! was designed
to make use of RE-USEABLE code. Any task
that may be needed repeatedly should be
in its own routine. There is a limit to
how many routines you can have, namely
1024 bytes for global variable and routine
names. The smaller names you use, the
more of them you can use. I have written
several large programs and have yet to run
out of room for the names. I usually end
up pressed for memory to hold all the
needed code. A second reason is that it
makes for more readable code. A different
programmer may want to make use of your
code. By keeping routines small, focused,
and well documented, other programmers may
be better able to reuse your code. It is
much easier to read when there are few
global variables, and each routine uses
only the variables it needs to do its
task.
<p>
		You may think Echo was a small routine, believe me, it isn't. Translated to ML
		(Machine Language) it grows dramatically.
		You can benefit from substituting your own
		optimized ML code for the tasks that are
		repeated often. To show you how much
		difference there can be, I have supplied
		an optimized ML version of the AscToInt
		function. This function is used several
		times in one EchoS call. Each byte of
		code we save counts as one cycle for each
		letter in a string of characters. This
		savings will result in increased response
		time.
<p>
Load the old AscToInt routine into your Editor, compile it, and while still in the Monitor type; ? AscToInt &ltRETURN&gt Record the left most number to paper. Now type; * AscToInt &ltRETURN&gt and get ready to stop the listing using the &ltCNTL&gt&lt1&gt key combination. Stop the list when you see a diamond after the equals sign, this

is the RETURN byte. Record the leftmost number here and subtract the first number from it. I find it to be 48 bytes long, whereas, this new function does the same thing in only 27 bytes. That works out to about 21 EXTRA cycles needed in the code written by Action!
<p>
Assuming a 19 byte string, on only a half of a line of text, 400 cycles can be saved using the new routine. Print just three lines of text and you can expect to gain over 2000 cycles!
<p>
<pre>
BYTE FUNC AscTolnt=*(BYTE a)
[$85 $E0     ;STA $E0       Save Accu. 
 $29 $80     ;AND #$80      Mask out 
 $85 $E1     ;STA $E1       inverse bit 
 $45 $E0     ;EOR $E0       Gone! 
 $C9 $20     ;CMP $20       a<32

 $85 $A0     ;STA $A0       Still in Accu.
 $60]        ;RTS
</pre>
<p>
I listed it in this form for those of you trying to optimize your own code. You can compare the two routines, which operate in much the same fashion. One bit of razzle-dazzle, you may notice I didn't clear or set the carry flag, even though I performed branches that depend upon it. The CMP instruction affects the carry, if operand >= accumulator, carry is set. Also 'SBC $1F' supposes it needed a borrow (Carry is clear) so it takes one away also. The total subtracted from the accumulator is 32 ($20).
<p>
Zero page memory, used because of its high access speed, is not hard to find. Making efficient use of it is another matter. Action! uses $A0-$A1 to store returned values from functions, and, $A3-$AF to Store parameters. I use $E0-$EF.<br>

Next month, flowsharts!

<h2 align=center>NEWSLETTER December, 1995</h2>


<h3>News from the Interim President Dec.</h3>
<p>By Mike Fitzpatrick

<p>President's Corner

<p>	There's not a lot to report on this month. The officers both elected and appointed agreed to continue for the next year.
<p>	Our Christmas Party is scheduled for the December meeting. Everyone who signed up please remember to bring your dish to the meeting place a little early.
<p>	We are going to have a very abbreviated meeting so that the socialization be maximized.
<p>We will be getting back to business in January.

<h3>BBS News</h3>

<p>Not much to report this month all seems well. I think that classes or demonstrations on how to access the BBS and download as well as upload are in order..

<h3>Treasurer's Report</h3>
<p> by Greg Leitner
<p>	This is what it is all about folks! Two new members were welcomed at our November meeting along with another guest who came to visit our Club. Some old faces we haven't seen for a while and it's always good to see the regulars who never seem to miss a meeting.
<p>	The nominations and elections of our officers went very smoothly and I congratulate and welcome Mike Fitzpatrick as our President for the upcoming year 1996. Also thanks to those who chose to keep their current positions again for 1996. If not for their support the Club may not have made It this far
<p>	And speaking of making it this far, I must say that we have to be extremely encouraged to see the membership participation at the last few monthly meetings. We have talked about trying to yet New Members into the Club for the past couple of years but we hadn't had much success until recently. I don't know the exact reason fur that but it sure feels good to see that there are still Atarians out there that are seeking us out. Now it is up to us to see that our members feel that choosing our Club was worth their time and money. I know that if it wasn't for SPACE I wouldn't be here writing a column for people who use Atari computers. I would probably be working on an IBM (shudder and be miserable because I couldn't get something else to work on the darn thing. But believe me when I say that there is no where I would rather be on the second Friday of every month but at the Space user's group meeting, and I hope you all feel the same way.
<p>	Now for some more good news about the November meeting. We took in receipts of $118.00 which included three membership renewals and (yea) two new memberships. Also because of an absolutely great DOM we took in another $30.00 along with $13.00 of blank disk sales. I just want to mention to Terry that the two games on the November DOM were about the best I have seen in a very long time and if he could duplicate that feat again the Club stands to make some big Lucks. Kudos to Terry, keep up the good work.
<p>	Our only expense that was paid out for November was the monthly BBS phone bill of $28.74. The monthly newsletter was not paid because Mike Schmidt did not make the meeting in November, but he does the newsletter so cost effectively that it costs less than $15.00 a month. Our bank balance increased (it's so nice to use the word increase when your working on the financials) by about $90.00 for the month and our balance now stands at $549.16 for the month ended November 1995.
<p>	What more can I say in closing but that November was about as good as it gets. Let's keep it going in December and into the new year, and also don't forget the pot luck Christmas party in December.

<h3>Minutes of Space meeting</h3>
<p> November 10, 1995

<p>	The Space Computer club meeting for November started at 7:40 PM. Mike Fitzpatrick, acting club president welcomed everyone to the monthly meeting. Mike asked if everybody received a newsletter for the month of November. Mike commented that there wasn't much for minutes for the October '95 meeting.

<p><strong>TREASURER REPORT-</strong>
<p>	Greg reported that last month, club took in $100. There was also some expenses. The club broke even. The club has a balance of about $460. Room rental will be due in December or January.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick asked if there was any comments, corrections, or deletions, hearing none Mike went on to OLD BUSINESS.
<p>
<strong>OLD BUSINESS-</strong><br>
None.

<p><strong>NEW BUSINESS-</strong><br>
ELECTIONS OF OFFICERS AND CLUB VOLUNTEERS

<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick nominated for Space Club President and Terry Streeter for vice-president. Both accepted.
<p>Greg Leinter will continue as Space Club Treasurer.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick asked that the club volunteer positions, now temporary or interim, be turned permanent until next election. People holding these positions accepted the change. The membership also approved this change. Mike Fitzpatrick also hoped that Space Club newsletter editor would stay on in his position. Mike Schmidt, club newsletter editor was not present at meeting.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick also stated that he would like to give Mike Schmidt, newsletter editor, more flexibility with the newsletter. What's in it, how big, and when to put a newsletter out. Mike asked approval of the membership. It was approved.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick talked about troubles with F-Mail. Mike stated that the BBS system would not support certain kind of uploads on F-Mail. Try to keep it Atari uploads.
<p> 	Glenn Kirschenmann, membership chairman, reported that the club had 2 new members sign-up and 3 renewals of membership.
<p>	The upcoming Space 13th Christmas Party was discussed. Mike Fitzpatrick asked if the membership would consider the club buying a Christmas ham for the party. The membership decided there would be more than enough food at the party and the buying of a Christmas Ham was unnecessary. It was voted down.
<p>	A Christmas Party Potluck list was circulated by club secretary. The club members signed up to bring a potluck item for the Christmas Party. The list will be given to the newsletter editor. The list will be put into December newsletter, so members that couldn't make it to meeting can see it.
<p>	Club members Mike Weist, Mike Fitzpatrick, Bill Cotter, Ray Wafer, Greg Leinter, and Mike Fitzpatrick's wife will help with preparations and clean-up at the Christmas Party.
<p>	Terry Streeter, new club vice-president, asked the membership to bring donated Atari hardware and software items for a Christmas Party raffle in December.
<p>	Terry Streeter also asked the membership what they wanted on the December Chfistmas DOM.
<p>	Mike Fitzpatrick gave the membership a update on the club property inventory in progress.
<p>	A club member asked about a update on the new Space club advertisement flyer, the committee working on this, is still toying with ideas,
<p>Meeting adjourned at 8:10 PM.

<h3 align=center>October and November in Review</h3>

<p>	Hamfest was held at the Civic Center in downtown St. Paul on October 28, 1995. The Electronic shows are always fun even if you don't find a lot of Atari stuff to buy. At the show about the only Atari stuff I saw was a XM 301 modem and some 2600 and 7800 game cartridges. The XM 301 modem is 300 baud, probably a item a Atari computer person would pass up, in hopes of finding a 2400 baud. The Atari software and hardware seems to get more and more hard to find at the electronic shows. It is nice to know that Space Atari Club is still around with people who bring in Atari software and hardware for sale. I did run into a few club members like Tony Walsh and Terry Streeter. Oh! What the heck! next show I will find some Atari stuff.
<p>
	At the November meeting of Space, there was some interesting talk during the meeting. We gained a feel new members. One new member was directed to the club by our software and hardware vendor, Lance Ringquist. Lance told the new member about the club, so he came to the meeting and signed up as a member. Thanks Lance! The new member had the opportunity to talk to our Larry Serflaten about some Atari programming. Larry was very happy to spend some time talking to the new member. We had a visit from a person from New Ulm, Minn. He goes by the handle, Rambler. Can you believe that, all the way from New Ulm, MN. to attend a club meeting. The November meeting not only had a good number of members at the meeting, but they stayed for quite a while.
<p>
	Plans for the Space 13th Christmas Party at the December meeting are already started. A potluck list was circulated at the November meeting. A party committee has been formed. There will be fun, food, and maybe some Atari Trivia. So come to the Space Christmas Party and be ready to have a good time. Hey! If you have a friend bring him with. If you run into a former Space club member, tell him to come too! Below is a copy of the potluck list circulated at the November meeting. If you weren't at this meeting, but are coming to Christmas Party, bring a potluck food item.

<h2 align=center>See you all at the<br>
Christmas Party!!!!!</h2>

#16       CAUGHT IN THE FLOW
--------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
Many people know how to use a map. Fewer people know how to make one. The same could be said for a newspaper, toaster, baseball glove, microwave, or a flowchart. They are all tools, used when we want to do a specific task. When it comes time to order and list all the logical steps and branches of a new program, a flowchart is your tool to gain perspective.
<p>
To demonstrate my point, I will play the roll of plant manager, you are my shipping process engineer. We are about to tool up for 12 different products of merchandise. Our automatic shelves will accept any of the items from the end of a conveyor. You are to design the conveyor system that will move each item to its proper shelf. The products will arrive from the plant on one conveyor in random order. Each of the 12 products are differentiated by either color, size or, weight. You get to use scanners, scales, gates, and conveyors to build the warehouse storage system.
<p>
Scanners measure color and size, scales measure weight, gates divert the box to another conveyor if the (scan/weight) test fails. This information, combined with a complete description of the 12 products, will provide you with the main reason why flowcharts are used. If you attempt to submit a design, you will have to have a record of it for others to inspect. You need a piece of paper to express such a large complicated system. A flowchart is simply a representation of the complete design, drawn out on paper.
<p>
Of the 12 items:<br>
3 are black, 3 are red<br>
3 are blue, 3 are black and red

<p>(Scanners designed to detect black will pass the black boxes, and the black and red boxes also. The same for scanners that detect red, will pass both the red boxes and the boxes that are black and red.)
<ul>
<li>Black boxes are small, medium, or large. Black items weigh 10 Lbs. 
<li>Red has small, medium, and large boxes. Red items weigh 10 Lbs. 
<li>Blue has 1 large and 2 medium boxes. One of the medium blue weighs 20 Lbs, the other blue boxes weigh 50. 
<li>Black and red has 2 small and 1 med. One of the small black and red items weighs 20 Lbs, the others weigh 50.
</ul>
<p>This brief description should give you a different size, weight or color for each of the twelve products.
<p>
You must now devise a path for the items to follow using as few scanners, scales, and gates as possible, making sure all the items get transported to a shelf and that no shelf has more than one type of item stored on it. Once you have given this some thought, try to determine the least amount of gates, scanners, and scales you would need to do the job. Then see if you can reduce your plan to using only that amount.
<p>
The perspective you gain when you build your flowchart (floorplan) is included in the ability to conceptualize each action needed to accomplish the desired outcome. The first action needed in the floorplan is a scanner and gate to divide up the incoming boxes of product. You can label that action as a test and branch, but what test would be best suited to be the first test? There are several variables, and perhaps a few different solutions, what is the first thing to consider? If this sort of problem interests you, perhaps you will make a good programmer.
<p>
Most flowcharts consist of input/output blocks (slanted rectangles), decision blocks (diamonds), processing blocks (rectangles), termination or beginning blocks (ovals), and the lines and arrows that connect them all. You can use this system to solve a problem like the one above, or you can devise your own system. When you have completed the flowchart, you have created an algorithm a special method for solving a problem. Programs typically contain many algorithms, because they often do many things. The test and branch from above is a decision type operation. Input from the plant, of course, is input, with lines as conveyors. The (automatic) shelf could be thought of as a save or store process. Whatever works for you, may be useful!<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
When a user has to wait for the computer to finish processing, the computer is most often being slowed down by many iterations in a loop structured algorithm. The programmer must use a good algorithm, coupled with the speed of machine language commands, to reduce the wait time. Moving from flowcharts to actual machine code is part of the programming process and is the subject of the next issue. Advanced users of ACTION! might want to "look in" and give me feedback and/or assistance!

Laurence McKinley Gould was born in Lacota, Michigan on August 22, 1896,
the son of Herbert and Anna (Updike) Gould. This photograph, labelled "Old
Times" in a family photo album, is the earliest image of Larry Gould we
have been able to locate.

<BR>
Gould finished from high school in South Haven, Michigan in 1914. His immediate <BR>
ambition at that time was to spend a year or two teaching school to earn money to <BR>
attend the University of Michigan, where he expected to study law.

Gould taught two years in Boca Raton. He also drove the school "bus",
organized community gatherings, helped found a Sunday School class, and
with his students published The Boca Raton Semi-Occasional Newspaper,
believed to be the first paper published in that community.

Decades later, Gould recalled in a letter that the two years he spent
teaching in the Boca Raton school "were amongst the most productive of my
whole educational career. I liked the Florida crackers as the natives were
sometimes called. There I made life-lasting friendships with people whom I
loved and respected."

<B>In the fall of 1916,</B> Gould enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of
Michigan. An acquaintance made that year with glacial geologist William
Hobbs, then chairman of Michigan's Geology Department, led to his
developing an interest in that subject. However, Gould's academic career
was temporarily interrupted the following year when he enlisted in the Army
ambulance corps following U.S. entry into World War I.

From July 1917 to March 1918 Gould trained in boot camp near Allentown,
Pennsylvania. From a letter written Oct. 30, 1917: "I should be very glad
to get another pair of socks like you can make....We sleep out in pup
tents and need something to keep our feet warm."

From a letter Jan. 3, 1918: "A man told me that they had the coldest
weather in 37 years. The thermometer has been way below zero at times and
it still continues in the neighborhood of zero." One wonders what Gould
would have thought had he known then that 10 years later he would be
leading an antarctic sledge journey and braving temperatures of 40-60
degrees below zero!

a story about going to the doctor for a physical exam. The doctor advised
him to give up smoking and start drinking. "Best damned advice I ever had!"

have been favorable, for Byrd subsequently asked Gould to join his
forthcoming expedition to Antarctica as geologist and geographer. This
portrait ran with the Associated Press report of Gould's appointment.

<B>Gould of the Antarctic.</B><BR>
The privately-financed Byrd expedition of 1928-30 was the first American
exploration of the southern continent in ninety years, and Gould was the
expedition's chief scientist -- the first geologist to reach the interior
of the Antarctic continent.

As the voyage south neared its end Byrd recorded the following decision in
his journal: "My mind as to the men is now made up. Gould I have made
Second in Command. A splendid fellow, competent, a brilliant geologist and
popular with men. He has proper respect for the seriousness of the job...
He will do well I am sure and I am fortunate to have him."

A few miles inland, on the outer edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, Gould
supervised construction of the barracks and workrooms of the base they
called "Little America." Eventually the camp included such amenities as a
small gymnasium, a fairly well-stocked library, a "maternity ward" for the
sled dogs, and a machine shop and storehouse made out of airplane crates.

Byrd never had cause to regret his choice of Gould as his
second-in- command. "If any man was liked by all, it was he," Byrd wrote in
<EM>Little America</EM> (Putnam, 1930), his personal account of the expedition.
"Larry was a blend of coolness and warmth. His friendly ways and his
fairness endeared him...Larry mingled, and yet was always respected...
When arguments waxed and flamed and drew to no conclusion, Larry was
resorted to as the seat of judgment. His mind seemed to have held every
fact that came into it."

<B>Hazardous science.</B><BR>
While making his first aerial explorations in late January, Byrd discovered
the Rockefeller mountain range some 140 miles east from Little America, and
a few weeks later Gould and two others flew to the area to conduct
geological investigations. He collected his samples, but before the group
could return to base, they were caught by a fierce blizzard which destroyed
their Fokker monoplane. The party had fought to anchor the plane in the
face of tremendous winds -- at one point Dr. Gould was observed by one of
his companions "hanging onto a rope attached to one of the wing tips [and
being] blown straight out, like a flag" -- but to no avail. The party's two

As the accompanying newspaper clippings make clear, the world was kept
abreast of the entire drama as it transpired.  Gould later claimed to be
annoyed by all the publicity about the party "lost in the mountains,"
insisting that they never were lost; they knew exactly where they were the
entire time.

On November 4, 1929 Gould and five companions set out on what was to be an
epic 2 1/2 month, 1500 mile dog-sledge journey south into the Queen Maud
Mountains and back. The party's primary mission was to provide ground
support and possible emergency assistance for Byrd's historic flight over
the Pole, but it also was an opportunity to conduct the first geological
and glaciological survey of an area described by Gould as "a veritable
paradise for a geologist."

<B>Reaching the rocks.</B><BR>
On December 7 Gould led his team up the mountain's steep southern slope.
"We roped to climb and 'herringboned' and 'sidebilled' our way up on our
skis," he wrote in his journal for that day. "Had to climb even steeper
slopes beyond these first crevasses to reach the coveted rocks -- a bit
hazardous this, for we were climbing along a steep side hill, and some 200
feet below us, paralleling our course, was a great yawning chasm. The snow
was crusted over, and it was hard to make our skis stick, but we finally
reached our rocks, the very rocks I wanted most to find in the Antarctic."
<P>
<A HREF="ImagesII/reachingrocks3.jpg"><IMG ALIGN="right" HEIGHT="113" WIDTH="144" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="5" SRC="ImagesII/reachingrocks3.gif"></A>
Gould hoped to confirm a suspicion that Mt. Nansen and the Queen Maud
Mountains were part of a great uplifted fault system that stretched across
the continent for more than 1,000 miles, and to find evidence that
Antarctica was linked geologically to the Earth's other great land masses.
The rock formations on the peak -- a series of sandstones with impure coaly
material in the top seams -- proved that Gould's supposition was correct.
"No symphony I have ever heard, no work of art before which I have stood in
awe ever gave me quite the thrill that I had when I reached out after that
strenuous climb and picked up a piece of rock to find it sandstone. It was
just the rock I had come all the way to the Antarctic to find," Gould wrote
in a radiogram to Commander Byrd.

From Mt. Nansen the sledgers proceded east along the mountains past the
150th meridian, which put them into land unclaimed by any other nation.
There, in a cairn on a low peak, they left a note claiming this land as "a

The geological party had traversed much of the same ground followed by
Roald Amundsen in his historic trek to the Pole in 1911-12, and on
Christmas Day they were elated to locate on Mt. Betty, near the Axel
Heiberg glacier, a cairn that had been left by Amundsen.  As Gould
described it, "We couldn't help standing at attention, with hats off, in
admiring respect for the memory of this remarkable man before we touched a
rock of the cairn. It was one of the most exciting moments of the summer
when I pried the lid off the tin can in the cairn and took out a bit of
paper which had formerly been a page in Amundsen's notebook, and on which
he had briefly recorded the discovery of the South Pole."

Commander Byrd termed the Gould sledge journey "the outstanding personal
achievement of the expedition." Its scientific harvest was great, but it
was also an unrivalled adventure; the last episode of the era of dog-sled
exploration.

Gould's sense of the adventure is evident in the following passage from
<EM>Cold:</EM>  "I think man has found no means of pioneering by land or sea or air,
that reaches the high conception of polar sledging with dogs. I think no
other method of travel can be as fascinating in its entirety and I know of
no other activity that makes such complete demands on all that there is in
a man. It demands the most rigid self-discipline or self-control; it calls
for the utmost resourcefulness and it taxes the endurance of the hardiest."

<B>To Carleton, 1932.</B><BR>
Authorities at Carleton College were impressed by Gould when he came to the
campus to deliver his lecture on the Byrd expedition, and in 1932 when
plans were being laid to reorganize and significantly upgrade the college's
then-scant offerings in geology, they succeeded in hiring him as a full
professor and chair of that department.  Moving to Minnesota apparently was
agreeable, for, as he once said, "I feel best in weather that makes me
shiver."

How did the adventurer feel about trading the thrills of the Antarctic for
the tamer qualities of the classroom? "I had to choose between exploring
and teaching as my life work," he told the Carletonian in 1933. "I've

"The spell of Gould was upon Carleton before its generator assumed the
presidency. Back of the spell were a ground-gripping body, broad and
hirsute hands, leathern face outcropped with stubborn stubble, low-slung,
tousled forelock, hearty manner, and lusty laugh. The total impression
accorded well with tales of arctic exploration and lecture pictures of fur
capote and huskies."  <EM>[Carleton: The First Century</EM>, 1966]

"Gould dressed casually. A dash of dowdiness became him well. Rolling socks
and sagging tweeds, variegated shirts and flaming ties--all were harmonized
in a far from ordinary mortal." [<EM>Carleton: The First Century</EM>, 1966]  Within
a year of Gould's arrival at Carleton, his taste for fanciful
neckware--particularly in his favorite hue of solid red--had become
associated with a new college tradition:  Wild Tie Day, when male students
attempted to outdo Gould, and one another, in the brilliancy of their
cravats.

Gould's out-of-the-classroom activities continued to be extensive and
varied throughout this period. He produced numerous papers and articles on
glacial geology. He was a popular speaker in a variety of forums on campus
and off. In 1936 he was a delegate to the International Congress of Geodesy
and Geophysics in Edinburgh, and in 1937 he attended an international
geological congress in Moscow and then spent a month on a Russian
icebreaker in the Arctic. In 1938-39 he served a term as president of the
Minnesota Academy of Science. When the U.S. entered World War II he was
granted a leave of absence to become chief of the Arctic section of the
Army-Air Force's Arctic, Desert and Tropic Information Center. He returned
to Carleton in the fall of 1944, and the following spring was instrumental
in organizing a memorable four-day conference on "Problems of the Far
North."

Early in 1944 Carleton's President Cowling officially advised his Trustees
of his intent to retire following the 1944-45 academic year. The Trustees
appointed a committee, chaired by Laird Bell, to consider candidates as
Cowling's successor. Dean of the College Lindsey Blayney, also preparing to
retire, warmly endorsed the suggestion that Gould be elevated from the
faculty to the presidency - as this letter sent to the committee in April
1945 attests.

In his first years as president, Gould guided the college's response to the
the demographic pressures created by a large influx of returning veterans.
Fundraising was needed to meet Carleton's needs for a number of new
buildings in the years ahead, beginning with a new library and a fine arts
building. Gould exerted his leadership in pushing all departments of the
college to ever higher levels of academic expectation and achievement. In
1946 he urged adoption of a uniform retirement age for faculty, and caused
Carleton to become the first college in the Middle West to require that all
applicants take College Entrance Board examinations. The following year he
prompted the Board to clarify the status of longstanding affiliations with
the Congregational, Baptist, and Episcopal denominations, and to declare
that in the matter of student admissions church affiliation was distinctly
secondary to scholastic attainments. 1948 saw the introduction of
comprehensive exams for seniors. Seeking to attract and retain especially
talented young teachers, he urged the Board to commit itself to increases
in faculty salaries. He also sought to pursue longterm plans for
strengthening Carleton's relations with her own alumni, and in pursuit of
this aim committed himself to a heavy program of speaking engagements with
alumni groups around the country. And of course he gave particular
attention to what he always considered his most important duty, the making
of appointments. In a day when most hiring was done directly by the
president, Carleton benefitted tremendously by Gould's usually-shrewd
judgment regarding the potential of young candidates for positions, and by
his ability to persuade many of the best of them to come to Carleton.

On the same day as his appearance before the Norwegian Geographic Society,
Gould had been presented to Norway's King Haakon, and was surprised when at
the conclusion of their interview the king had conferred upon him the
Knight's Cross, 1st Class,  of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olaf, and
suggested that he wear it to that evening's lecture. Gould was the
recipient of dozens of impressive medals and significant awards, but he was
particularly fond of this cross and wore it frequently in his lapel.

After five years, much had been accomplished. The Art Building, Boliou
Hall, had been completed, and hopeful plans were being developed for a new
library and for the remodeling of Willis Hall into a Memorial Union. Gould
issued a five year report that summer in which he addressed "the question
of the permanent size we wish the College to be." Reflecting that the
experience of community participation is impossible in large groups, he
hesitated to state a definite figure for the "ideal" size for Carleton
College, but did assert that "we who have experimented with and thought
about the problem during the post-war years are convinced that for us it is
certainly less than one thousand students."

<B>With Trustee Chairman Laird Bell, 1955.</B><BR>
Gould's relations with his Trustees were excellent, and President and Board
valued one another's contributions tremendously. In the mid-1950s Gould was
involved in a number of extracurricular activities which necessarily
consumed a good deal of his time -- appointment by Eisenhower to the
National Science Board, election as a Trustee of the Ford Foundation, and a
key role in connection with planning for the International Geophysical Year
-- all in addition to his usual heavy schedule of speaking engagements. In
1955 the Carleton Board of Trustees took note of these presidential
commitments and wholeheartedly endorsed them, stating that by engaging in
them President Gould was also promoting the best interests of Carleton
College. However, they were also concerned to guard against overwork, and
marked Gould's tenth presidential year by sending Peg and Larry on a
seven-week vacation sojourn to South America, a rest and relaxation break
taken at the Board's insistence.

In July 1955 Gould travelled to Paris to head the United States delegation
to an eleven nation planning conference on Antarctic research programs to
be carried out during the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year (IGY).
Subsequently he was appointed director of the United States IGY Antarctic
Program, and in that role returned to Antarctica early in 1957 to inspect
logistical preparations for the IGY being carried out as part of the Navy's
"Operation Deepfreeze." Working out of the main American base on Ross
Island in McMurdo Sound, Dr. Gould supervised scientific operations at five
other United States observation stations, including one at the South Pole
itself.

<B>Gould in Antarctica, 1957.</B><BR>
At the end of 1957 Gould made another, month-long, trip to Antarctica, this
time to accompany six members of the House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce, who were inspecting the IGY Antarctic program and its
scientific researches in the fields of meteorology, oceanography,
geomagnetism, seismology, ionospheric physics, and glaciology. Although the
scientific knowledge gained from the IGY research programs was enormous,
Gould hoped that the "human and social results" would prove more important
in the long run. "This vast global effort was carried out in a period of
almost unprecedented worldwide turmoil and unrest," he wrote more than a
decade later in the <EM>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</EM> (December, 1970). "It
was the IGY cooperative efforts in Antarctica, coldest of all the
continents, that witnessed the first thawing of the Cold War....It
demonstrated, as never before, that the international community of science
is the most hopeful of all examples of world cooperation and organization."

<B>The Antarctic Treaty.</B><BR>
As chairman of the Committee on Polar Research of the National Academy of
Sciences, Gould testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in
favor of the Antarctic Treaty, a milestone in international cooperation
which reserved the entire continent as a scientific preserve "to be used
exclusively for peaceful purposes." Gould later said of this agreement:
"The Antarctic Treaty is indispensable to the world of science which knows
no national or other political boundaries; but it is much more than that. I
believe it is a document unique in history which may take its place
alongside the Magna Carta and other great symbols of man's quest for
enlightenment and order."

Back at Carleton in the period following his IGY directorship, Gould was
"cooking up" new plans for moving the college forward. In 1957 he outlined
for the Trustees some things he hoped to accomplish before his retirement.
Plans were already underway for building the two new dormitories that would
become Musser and Myers; in addition, Gould told the Board that he hoped to
raise eight million dollars for the following purposes: a biology and
physics building, ten endowed professorships, scholarship endowment, a
men's field house, a women's gymnasium, a new administration building, and
general maintenance.

In October 1958, as Myers and Musser were dedicated, the College announced
a major development campaign, with a goal of $10 million and the theme "In
Pursuit of Excellence." The student body presented Gould with a gold plated
shovel to symbolize their support for the ambitious
program. That same year the Board gave approval to a plan gradually to
increase the size of the student body to 1300 over a period of years.

People familiar with the Carleton of the late '50s and into the '60s will
enjoy spotting familiar faces in this photo. During the Gould era full
attendance at faculty meetings was expected -- Gould's secretary Sally
Crandall would sit in the back of the room taking attendance, and missing
faculty could expect a query the next day as to the reasons behind their
absence. But these men and women were valued. When asked to name the one or
two things he did that made his administration so successful, Gould replied
"Oh, that is easy. Going out and getting the best faculty I could find,
bringing them here, and letting them loose."

The origins of Carleton's longstanding "Schiller" tradition --for the

-- are not entirely clear, many conflicting stories having been told.
Certain it is, though, that the mania for stealing, hiding, showing, and
generally running amok with the plaster bust commenced in the Gould era,
certainly by the 1957-58 school year.

The January 7, 1961 meeting of the Carleton Board of Trustees was a busy
one. There was discussion of the establishment of the Laurence M. Gould
Science Fund. There was a decision to revise the goal of the ongoing
development campaign upward to $12 million. And President Gould advised his
Board that "since he was in his sixty-fifth year ... he wished to retire in
the predictable future." Eventually his retirement date was fixed at July
1, 1962. After seventeen years, it was difficult for many to imagine
Carleton College without Larry Gould at its head.

Gould's Carleton citation, written by Reed Whittemore, read in part:
"Larry Gould has already his full measure of such tributes; his cup of
honorary degrees runneth over. In marking, thus, his departure we are doing
really nothing at all unless we can tell him what cannot be told by the
gift of a degree. We need to tell him that this community prizes less the
academic distinction he has done so much to bring it than the spirit in
which he has done so; to tell him that the money he has found to strengthen
our enterprises has been little beside the strength of his leadership; to
tell him that his magnificent performance in the role of president was only
possible because of the humor, gentleness and humanity he brought to that
role; and, perhaps most of all, to tell him--as I now do tell him--that
what we are doing now we are doing not out of a sense of duty but out of
love."

That day, in recommending the election of Larry Gould as president emeritus
of Carleton College, Laird Bell read the following statement:
<P>
<PRE> </PRE>
"This Board cannot permit the president of the College to retire without
some record, however inadequate, of its gratitude for what his
administration has meant to us all. Building upon a college already
distinguished, he has guided it to still greater stature. The new buildings
are an expression of this growth; the endowment has increased many fold,
thanks to his efforts; but his real contribution has been in his leadership
in the academic field. His first concern has been the selection of a
faculty whose primary devotion has been teaching, supported by genuine
scholarship. He has maintained the College as a place of learning, without
compromise with the shallow or superficial. He has unfailingly supported
the faculty in its freedom to teach. Above all, by his own example he has
showed what it is to be at once a teacher, a scholar, a public servant, and
a man of affairs. He has lived up to the Whitehead principle that he often
quoted - 'Moral education is impossible apart from the habitual vision of
greatness.' It is the fervent hope of the Board that he may find in his new
activities the satisfaction and happiness that his labors have entitled him
to enjoy."
<P>
The Board signified its unanimous approval of this action with a standing
ovation.

<B>A Legacy of Excellence.</B><BR>
In commenting on Gould's retirement in its June 25, 1962 issue,<EM> Newsweek</EM>
noted that it was under his tenure that Carleton transformed "from a
little-known Congregational institution into one of the finest liberal-arts
colleges in the nation." The previous year the <A HREF="ImagesIV/chicagotrib.jpg"><EM>Chicago Daily Tribune</EM></A> had
labelled the school "a little Harvard in academic distinction". Altogether
Gould had given 30 years of his life to Carleton, and the identification
between the College and its famous president was close. The association was
unquestionably an advantageous one for the school, and Gould claimed that
it was equally so for himself. "If I had my life to live over again," he
stated shortly before his retirement, "I could not invest it with greater
satisfaction to myself than I have done at Carleton College."

<B>Retirement.</B><BR>
Jimmy Carter notwithstanding, Larry Gould must have had one of the most
active "retirements" on record. Between 1962 and 1979 Gould returned to
Antarctica four more times. He continued with a busy schedule of public
speaking engagements and maintained significant leadership roles in
numerous scientific organizations. And he began a whole new career as
Professor of Geosciences at the University of Arizona.
<P>
Gould had met Arizona's president Richard Harvill in the late 1950s, when
delivering an address in Tucson. At that time Harvill had told him that if
he wanted to join the Arizona faculty after retiring from Carleton, "you
can have a job as long as I have and you can do anything you want." In the
fall of 1962, after departing Carleton, Gould went again to Antarctica in
his role as chair of the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Polar
Research. Following that, Peg and Larry settled into their new home in
Tucson, and Larry returned to the classroom. It was a satisfying new life.
Years later, when in his nineties, Gould told a University of Arizona
reporter: "When I retired [from Carleton], I thought, well, I'll come down
here and teach a couple of years and I'll go to seed and I'll die. Well
instead of two years, I taught 18... This place has given me a whole new
wonderful career. That's one reason that I've lived on to 90 years. I would
have died if I hadn't had something to do. I can't express my debt to the
University of Arizona."

Gould continued to contribute actively to many activities dear to his
heart, and to be honored for those contributions. He was instrumental in
raising money for the expansion of the Mayo Clinic, and was a moving force
in the foundation of a Mayo Medical School. He continued until 1972 his
chairmanship of the National Research Council's Polar Research Board. From
1963 to 1970 he was president of the International Council of Scientific
Union's Special Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR). In 1965 he became
president of the largest general body of American scientists, the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. Displayed nearby are a sampling
of awards and tokens of appreciation given to Gould during the years
1963-1966.

<B>A shift in politics.</B><BR>
From a feature on Gould printed in the <EM>Minneapolis Tribune</EM>, Jan. 3, 1965:
"During the recent election he was a member of Scientists and Engineers for
Johnson and Humphrey. This was quite a switch, he admitted, for a lifelong
Republican and one sometimes pressed by Minnesota Republicans to run for
the Senate against Democrat Humphrey. His reason, he said bluntly, was
Arizona's Barry Goldwater and Goldwater's opposition to the
administration's civil rights bill, the nuclear test ban and the Antarctic
treaty. 'When we went to Tucson,' Gould said, 'we found we had to register
by party. I went into one booth and my wife went into another. When we came
out, I said to her, "My father would spin in his grave if he knew it, but
I'm a Democrat." She said, "I am too."'"

During this visit, Gould visited a deposit near the Beardmore Glacier to
investigate a recent fossil find. Gould and fellow National Science Board
member Grover Murray confirmed that the fossil was a 240 million year old
reptile skull associated with tropical climates and closely resembling
others found in relative abundance in South Africa. Here was compelling
evidence supporting the then still controversial theory of continental
drift, and suggesting that Africa and Antarctica had once been attached.
Gould and Murray immediately radioed the National Science Foundation in
Washington, with the news that this was "not only the most important fossil
ever found in Antarctica, but one of the truly great fossil finds of all
time."

In 1971 the University of Arizona created its College of Earth Sciences,
with Gould serving initially as its acting director. In March of the
following year, in recognition of his many outstanding services and
contributions, and in appreciation for "the personal inspiration you have
provided to your students and associates," the University of Arizona Alumni
Association bestowed upon Gould its "Distinguished Citizen Award." The same
day the University dedicated the Laurence M. Gould Seminar Room in its

his 26 honorary degrees, from the University of Arizona. The citation read:
<P>
Laurence McKinley Gould-- You have combined several careers with brilliance
and grace. You are a geologist, educator, explorer, diplomat and
humanitarian. Your contributions as a teacher, researcher, scientist and
statesman are incalculable. You are perhaps the world's leading specialist
in glacial geology. Your years of Arctic and Antarctic exploration,
research and writing have established a solid foundation for all future
polar exploration, vitally important today as we search for new sources of
energy. In recognition of your contribution to mankind, and to the quality
of your own life, the University of Arizona confers upon you the degree of
Doctor of Science.

<P>                              BACKGROUND


<P>   The MM4-Meteorology Data CD-ROM is a joint agency NOAA project.  This
   CD-ROM was developed at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) with
   funding and data provided by the Atmospheric Research Laboratory's
   Atmospheric Sciences Modeling Division (ASMD).


<P>   Since 1991, members of the ASMD, on assignment to the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have participated in the
   Interagency Workgroup for Air Quality Modeling (IWAQM).  The IWAQM was
   formed by the EPA, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service, and the National Parks Service to review existing air quality
   modeling techniques, to identify consistent modeling approaches, and
   to develop the modeling tools needed to assess the individual and
   cumulative impacts of existing and proposed sources of air pollution
   on local and regional scales.  The IWAQM has determined that air parcel
   trajectory displacement errors typical of current regulatory modeling
   procedures can be significantly reduced by obtaining wind information
   from the Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric
   Research Mesoscale Model - Generation 4 (MM4) employing Four-Dimensional
   Data Assimilation (FDDA) techniques.


<P>   The ASMD staff completed the generation of MM4-derived meteorological
   data for each hour of the calendar year 1990.  Wind, temperature, dew-
   point depression and height data are available at 8 standard levels and
   15 variable levels with 80 kilometer horizontal resolution over the
   continental United States and adjacent portions of Canada, Mexico,
   the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  The 1990
   data are available on 12 monthly disks.  Each CD-ROM volume is
   comprised of the data for a given month and the software used to
   select and extract the data.

<CENTER>            The IWAQM Meteorological Data Set for 1990:
       Description of the Parent Model Structure and Configuration
</CENTER>

<P>  In order to provide meteorological data for a variety of air-quality
  modeling activities, the US EPA's Atmospheric Research and Exposure
  Assessment Laboratory used Version 8 of the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale
  Model - Generation 4 (MM4) to simulate atmospheric wind, temperature,
  moisture and precipitation over most of North America for the year of
  1990.  The horizontal grid spacing of the MM4 simulation was 80 km in
  both dimensions, with a grid array size of 85 by 56 centered on 90
  degrees west longitude and 40 degrees north latitude to cover most of
  the North American continent and adjacent oceanic areas.  The model
  simulation variables from the outer two columns and rows of grid points
  were not included in the published data set to avoid the boundary ef-
  fects typical of fixed-grid numerical models.  The domain of the model's
  vertical coordinate system extended from the earth's surface to the 100
  millibar pressure level (approximately 15km above sea level).  Its 15-
  level structure provides height-resolved information similar to that
  routinely obtained by the National Weather Service at 12-hour intervals
  from approximately 80 rawinsonde balloon sounding locations across North
  America.  However, the data set obtained from the MM4 simulation pro-
  vides synthetic soundings at 1-hour intervals for 4080 model grid-point
  locations, or about 600 times more information than is available from
  routine observational networks.  The 1990 data set is comprised of over
  20 billion bytes of information.


<P>  The annual data set was developed from the MM4 output of 80 separate
  simulations.  Each simulation was 5 days in length with a 12-hour overlap
  with chronologically adjacent simulations.  This 12-hour overlap was used
  to allow a model &quot;spin-up&quot; so each simulation's hour 12 conditions would
  match the previous simulation's ending conditions without the detrimental
  effects of model initialization.  The first 6 hours of each simulation
  was not used in the definition of the final data set.  Hour 7 through 11
  results were blended with the previous simulation results with a time-
  linear weighting function to produce temporally continuous fields in the
  final data set.  Beginning at hour 12, the simulation results were copied
  directly in the production of the annual data set.  Differences between
  adjacent simulations for these overlap periods were monitored and no
  significant discontinuities were detected.  At hour 12, the differences
  were often zero at the floating-point numerical precision of the CRAY
  Y/MP at EPA's National Environmental Supercomputing Center where the 80
  MM4 simulations were performed.

  production of the IWAQM Meteorological Data Set for 1990:

<H5>1992 ECONOMIC CENSUS CD-ROM SCHEDULE</H5>

<H6> Introduction </H6>

<PRE>
In the chart, an "x" indicates that the entire series is to be available; a "-
"
indicates that the CD-ROM will reflect the only part of the series.  Asterisks
highlight those data series to be available on CD-ROM but not in print.

The dates included on these charts are early projections, and any adjustment 
in
the timing of a particular report could move it from one CD-ROM issue to
another.

Note that while CD-ROMs will be manufactured only once each quarter, CD-ROM
subscribers can download data released more recently.  See "How to Get Updates
via Census/BEA Electronic Forum" under "General Information".

Legend:   -    Only part of the series available on this CD-ROM
          *    Includes data not available in print                              
          ** or TBA Release date to be announced

        County to County Migration Flow File on CD-ROM, Special Project (SP)

      312 presents data for non-movers, movers within counties, and all

      county-to-county migration streams between 1985 and 1990.  In New

      England, flows between minor civil divisions (MCD's) are shown.

        Data for SP 312 are based on the responses to the 1990 Census of

      Population and Housing questionnaire item 14b.

        The data for each migration flow consist of a geographic record (area

      of origin and area of destination) and 21 tables (matrices) showing the

      following characteristics.  See the List of Tables chapter for cross

      tabulations:

	Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) contain
records representing 5% or 1% samples of the housing
units in the U.S. and the persons in them. Selected
group quarters persons are also included. The file
contains individual weights for each person and housing
unit which, when applied to the individual records,
expand the sample to the total population. Most
population and housing items are listed below. Please see
the Data Dictionary for a complete listing of variables
and recodes. Both the 5% and 1% samples have the same
subject content and vary only in geographic composition
of the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA). A 3% elderly
sample will be available later.

	Each PUMS file provides records for States and
many of their geographic levels. The hierarchy is shown
below The 5% sample identifies every State and various
subdivisions of States called "Public Use Microdata
Areas", each with at least 100,000 persons. These
PUMAs were primarily based on counties, and may be
whole counties, groups of counties, and places. When
these entities have more than 200,000 persons, PUMAs
can represent parts of counties, places, etc. None of these
PUMAs on the 5% sample crosses state lines.

<P>
	On the other hand, the 1% sample was based
primarily on metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas, and
contains PUMAs which were made from whole central
cities, whole MSAs or PMSAs, MSA or PMSAs
outside the central city, groups of MSAs or PMSAs, and
groups of areas outside MSAs or PMSAs. When the
areas have more than 200,000 persons, 1% PUMAs can
represent parts of central cities, MSA/PMSAs, and so
forth. 1% PUMAs may cross State lines and in that case
State codes are not shown. See examples of PUMAs in
figures 2-4.

	Since individual weights are provided on PUMS,
most estimates derived from PUMS tabulations can be
checked for reasonableness against other 1990 printed
reports, STFs or microfiche produced from sample data.

<P>
	Listed below are the 1990 census printed reports
containing sample data from summary tape products STF
3 and STF 4 which may be used to verify estimates
provided from PUMS files. These reports will be
available from Superintendent of Documents, U.S.

<P>
<H4><A NAME="TECHNICAL">TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION</A>
</H4>
<P>
	The file contains two record types a "housing" record
and a "person" record each consisting of 231 characters of data.
Each housing unit record is followed by a variable number of
persons records, one for each occupant. Vacant housing units
will have no person record, and selected persons in group
quarters will have a dummy housing record and a person record.

<P>
	The 5% (A) sample includes a separate file for
each state. The 1% (B) sample includes a file for each
State and a file containing PUMAs which cross State
lines. The 3% (O) sample (elderly file) has the same
geographic composition as the 5% sample, (but includes
housing units with at least one person age 60 and over or
group quarters persons age 60 and over.)

<P>
	The block size for the files varies with each
user's specifications, however the standard block size is
32,340 characters for 1990 PUMS.

<P>
<H4><A NAME="SOFTWARE">SOFTWARE CONSIDERATIONS</A>
</H4>
<P>
	The 1990 Public Use microdata files are a special
type of nonrectangular file-hierarchical. That is, the file
contains several record types each with different variables,
rather than one gigantic record with all the variables. We
release the PUMS in this format because of the
tremendous amount of data contained in one record. The
file is sorted to maintain the relationship between both
record types.

<P>
	Although these records are extremely large they
can be handled by most statistical or report writing
software. There are two basic record types: the housing
unit record and the person record. For 1990, each of the
records contains a serial number which links the persons
in the housing unit to the proper housing unit record, so
that a user no longer needs to worry about keeping the
record sequence as the file was delivered.

<P>
	In today's information processing environment,
most standard statistical software packages are now
capable of handling the file in either format: hierarchical
or rectangular structure. Most software packages, such as
SAS, SPSS, BMDP, and some relational data base
systems, will in fact rectangularize hierarchical files.
Further, the manuals accompanying most packages
contain samples of code showing how to process the
files. Several of the packages also have extract procedures
already coded into the software.

<P>
	The 1990 PUMS will be accompanied by
electronic data dictionaries in a format which will allow
the user to read in ASCII characters and prepare
statements transforming the variables and their
corresponding descriptions and values to the proper
statements required by the software package of choice.

<P>
	The files will be ASCII, with no special software
appended, so as to be compatible with most software
packages. But the technical documentation will include a
section on "how to use this file", where software
concerns will be addressed. The user must be familiar with the
processing system's limitations and the efficiency of the
procedures within the software packages.

<P>
	Users may also write their own code enabling
them to perform custom tabulations on their system of
choice.

<H4><a name="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></H4>



<P>This chapter serves as a guide for data users to both the

tape and the technical documentation.  Novice users trying

to understand how to use the documentation and the file

should read this chapter first.



<P>The SSTF 4 file has A and B records.  The A records

present data for all persons in 3 population (PA) tables and

in 3 housing (HA) tables.  The B records present more detail

in 70 population (PB) tables.  The Table (Matrix) Outlines

chapter gives a complete description of all tables in the A

and B records.

  

<H5><a name="Documentation">Documentation Chapters</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>The Abstract chapter in this documentation provides a

quick overview of the file, including the formal title,

geographic coverage, subject coverage, and file avail-

ability.  Also shown are citations for related reference

materials and printed reports.  Their titles and geography

are included in this section, along with purchasing

information.



<P>The Subject Locator is an aid to finding which tables

provide the information needed.  The List of Tables

(Matrices) and the Table (Matrix) Outlines provide two types

of presentations for the tables available in the file.  The

List of Tables has the table titles and universes.  The

Table Outlines offer a detailed presentation of the tables.

When reviewing the tables, remember that a colon(:)

following an entry indicates the entry is a heading, not a

data cell.

  

<H5><a name="User">User Notes</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>Information about file or documentation changes sometimes

becomes available after the documentation has been printed.

User notes inform the user community about these changes.

These are issued in a numbered series.  If there are

technical documentation changes, revised pages usually

accompany them.  The revised pages should be inserted in

their proper location, but the user note cover sheet should

be filed in the User Notes chapter.  Technical notes, which

contain file errata, are also issued by the Census Bureau.

We suggest filing these following appendix H.

  

<H5><a name="Data">Data Dictionary</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>The data dictionary describes the file and provides

character locations for each variable and each table.  It

has two elements, the identification section and the table

(matrix) section.



<P>In the identification section, the components include the

field name; the data dictionary reference name, a short

mnemonic for use with software packages; field size;

starting position; and data type (alphabetic, numeric, or

alphanumeric).



<P>The identification section of the data dictionary is

identical for all summary tape files.  It provides a list of

the geographic codes or refers the user to the appropriate

source.  Review the footnotes carefully; they provide

explanations for various terms.  These footnotes are listed

at the end of the identification section of the data

dictionary.



<P>The table (matrix) section provides information on the

table (matrix) number; table (matrix) description; number of

implied decimals in each cell (if not 0); starting position

within the record, within the segment, and for all cells

within the first-level variable; and cell coordinates.



<P>There also is a machine-readable data dictionary file on

the data tape.  This dictionary is designed to be converted

for use with various software packages.

  

<H5><a name="Appendixes">Appendixes</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>Detailed information on geographic areas is in appendix A

followed by subject-matter definitions in appendix B.

Appendix C provides detailed statistical information about

the data while appendix D outlines the data collection and

procedures.  Facsimiles of both the respondent instructions

and 1990 census long-form questionnaire are in appendix E.



<P>Appendix F furnishes detailed information on all the data

products of the 1990 census, as well as suggested sources of

information and assistance.  The record layout for the

machine-readable data dictionary file that accompanies each

tape order is in appendix G.



<P>Appendix H contains the code lists used in processing the

data.  These codes are used in conjunction with the table

(matrix) outlines and data dictionary chapters.

  

<H5><a name="Count">Count Corrections</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>The Census Bureau issues population count corrections on

an occasional basis.  Count corrections for geography at the

place level and above are available from Customer Services,

Data User Services Division, Bureau of the Census,

Washington, DC  20233.  Count corrections for geography at

the census tract/BNA level or below are available from

Population Division, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC

20233.  When requesting these corrections, please include

the desired census tract/BNA, block group, or block numbers.

  

<H4><a name="USING">USING THE FILE</a></H4>



<H5><a name="Internal">Internal File Labels</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>System Labels  Tape orders which specify labeled tapes

will have a standard American National Standards Institute

(ANSI) label.  The system label consists of 17 characters,

12 characters are used and the last 5 are "x" filed.  The

1990 SSTF 4 file has a Data Set Name (DSN) of

SSTF4XUS.Fnnxxxxx, where nn is a two-digit number with

leading zeros identifying the tape volume sequence.  (The

"X", "F", and "x" in the DSN remain constant.)

  

<P>User Labels  Each user tape will have six user header

labels and six user trailer labels.  These labels combine

information from the system label and the identification

portion of the first and last record.  These labels enable

the user to quickly identify the beginning and ending

records on each tape.

  

<P>User Header Labels--The user header  labels  are des-

ignated UHL1 through UHL6.  UHL1 and UHL2 repeat information

from the system label in HDR1 and HDR2.  (See the File

Information section.)  UHL3 and UHL4 contain information

from the identification portion of the first record on the

tape.  UHL5 and UHL6 contain a statement regarding the data

limitations.

  

<P>User Trailer Labels--The user trailer labels are desig-

nated UTL1 through UTL6.  UTL1 and UTL2 contain information

from the system trailer label.  UTL3 and subsequent user

trailer labels contain identification information from the

last record on the tape.  The unused portion of UTL6 is

blank filled.

  

<H5><a name="File">File Information</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>File information, such as record counts, is not provided

in the technical documentation.  However, each tape order is

accompanied by a tape creation sheet.  This sheet provides

the file name, file label (HDR1), the third user header

label (UHL3), record size, block size, and record count.

The third user header label for each reel identifies the

geography for the first record on the reel.  For example,

the UHL3 at the beginning of each reel of a three-reel file

provides the geography for the first record.  If the

geography needed is on reel three, only reel three needs to

be processed.



<P>The tape creation sheet received with the tape should be

filed in the technical documentation notebook or with other

tape information maintained by the user.

  

<H5><a name="Summary">Summary Level Sequence Chart and Geographic Area Component</a></H4>

Codes</H5>



<P>The Summary Level Sequence Chart chapter and the

geographic area component codes provide important

information for using the 1990 census summary tape files.

The Summary Level Sequence Chart chapter for the SSTF 4 file

identifies the geographic levels for which data are

provided.



<P>After identifying the summary level code, turn to chart 3

at the end of this chapter to determine the geographic area

codes and area characteristics provided on the tape for this

summary level.  Remember that an asterisk (*) indicates a

code in that field.  The code may be one of the standard

codes described below.



<P>The Summary Level Sequence Chart chapter also provides

geographic component code information.  This code identifies

the various geographic components for which the record is

repeated within the summary level.  These component codes

are provided in the identification section of the data dic-

tionary beginning in position 14.  For example in SSTF 4,

the Summary Level Sequence Chart indicates that for the

United States (summary level 010) the geographic component

codes are 00, 20, and 30.  By turning to the geographic com-

ponent variable in the data dictionary, you can determine

that the tables are available for total geography (00), in

metropolitan statistical area/consolidated metropolitan

statistical area (20), and not in metropolitan statistical

area/consolidated metropolitan statistical area (30).



<P>In short, always check the geographic code, the summary

level (beginning in position 11 of the data dictionary), the

geographic component code (beginning in position 14 of the

data dictionary), and the characteristic iteration

(beginning in position 16 of the data dictionary)  for

complete identification of an SSTF 4 record.

  

<H5><a name="A">A and B Records</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>SSTF 4 is a single file with the data presented in A and B

records.  The A and B records can be identified by the

characteristic iteration field (CHARITER, position 16 in the

data dictionary).



<P>Each record type presents a different set of tables.  The

Table (Matrix) Outlines chapter gives a complete description

of all tables in the A and B records.



<P>The A records have 3 population (PA) and 3 housing (HA)

tables.  The A records provide data for all persons for each

summary level and geographic component level within a unit

of geography.  Since the characteristic iteration in the A

records is always all persons, the A records can be

identified by blanks in the characteristic iteration field.



<P>The B records present more detail in 70 housing (PB)

tables.  The B records are identified by numbers in the

characteristic iteration field.  Chart 1 lists the

characteristic iteration codes for the A and B records.

</pre>

<H5><a name="RecordI">Record Identification</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>Each record on a summary tape file is uniquely identified

by a combination of specific geographic codes (for example,

State abbreviation), summary level, geographic component

code, and characteristic iteration.  Chart 1 indicates that

for A records, data are presented for all persons.  The 3

population and 3 housing tables in the A records for SSTF 4

provide counts of total persons and housing units,

unweighted sample counts, and 100-percent counts.



<P>Most of the population tables in the B records provide

data for civilian noninstitutionalized persons 16 years and

over and for the 12 disability characteristics listed in

Chart 1.



<P>For example, in table PA1 (Persons), one can obtain the

total number of persons in the United States (summary level

010).  Using the B records, table PB14 (Sex by Age by

Earnings in 1989), you can retrieve the number of persons

with a mobility and self-care limitation that are not

prevented from working (characteristic iteration code 602)

that live in the United States (summary level 010).



<P>Remember, in both of these examples, you must check all

four fields--the summary level code, the geographic

component, the characteristic iteration, and the State

abbreviation--or you will find multiple records.



<P>In addition, a table may extend across segments.  Please

refer to the Record Segmentation section below for

information on selecting the correct segment of data.

  

<H5><a name="RecordS">Record Segmentation</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>Logical records are divided into segments, each containing

identification information and specific tables.  The logical

record has a record sequence number which is repeated in

each segment.  This is the logical record number (LOGRECNU)

which appears in position 19 of each segment.  Following

this, in position 25, is the logical record part number

(LOGRECPN).  The LOGRECPN indicates the segment number for a

block of data within a record.  See Chart 2, Segmentation of

the SSTF 4 Records, for a list of segments in the SSTF 4

file.  The total number of parts, or segments, in a record

(PARTREC) are shown in position 29.



<P>The A records have 8,165 characters in 1 segment.  The B

records have 114,310 characters divided into 14 segments of

8,165 characters each.  All of the segments include 300

characters of geographic identification information followed

by tables (matrices).  Tables split across segments are

indicated in Chart 2 below.  The geographic identification

information layout for each segment is identical to the

identification section described in positions 1-300 of the

data dictionary.  Filler appears in the record to complete a

record segment and also replaces data in some tables that

were not included in the final compilation.  The tables

containing filler are PB29 through PB35, PB44, PB47, PB50,

PB53, PB56, PB59, and PB62.



<P>The machine-readable data dictionary, which accompanies

the SSTF 4 file, provides information on these table

(matrix) splits across segments.

<P>Special area codes appear in the geographic area codes

portion of the data dictionary (positions 142-171) on all

SSTF's.  The codes represented may vary across SSTF's.

Special area code (9) is used in all summary levels on the

SSTF 4 file.  The nine codes for special area code (9) are

described below.

  

<H5><P>Special area code (9) Land/water area

</H5> <pre> 

  1  Significant land, significant (0.0005 or more square kilometers) water

  2  Significant land, minimal (less than 0.0005 square kilometer) water

  3  Significant land, zero (0) water

  4  Minimal land, significant water

  5  Minimal land, minimal water

  6  Minimal land, zero water

  7  Zero land, significant water

  8  Zero land, minimal water

  9  Zero land, zero water

 </pre> 

<H5><a name="Standard">Standard Codes</a></H4>

</H5>

<P>In the identification section of all summary tape files,

there are standard codes, undefined in the data dictionary,

that have identical meaning regardless of the field.--The

codes are the same size as the field; that is, a three-

character field will have three symbols.--These standard

codes are listed below.

<pre>  

  !    Not available--The codes would be shown except it had

       not been determined when the files were prepared (for

       example, metropolitan  area code  on a county summary

       level (050) on STF 1A).

  

  9    Not in--This indicates a "remainder of" an area, such

       as a  place code  in the portion of a county subdivi-

       sion not in a place, or the summary level is not part

       of any  area to which the code field applies, such as

       a summary  level which is not in an Alaska Native Re-

       gional Corporation.

  

  Blank   Not applicable--This indicates that the code is

          not applicable to the summary level.

  </pre>

<P>Where these codes are specifically defined in the data

dictionary, the defined code should be used.  For example,

in the division code description on the data dictionary

(position 89), the code for the Pacific Division is

indicated as "9."  This "9" should be interpreted as the

division code, not as "not in," the standard code for "9."

     Air CHIEF (Clearinghouse for Inventories and Emission
Factors) CD-ROM version 4.0 contains the following types of files:

      DOS text;
      Air CHIEF; 
      FIRE (Factor Information Retrieval System); 
      TANKS (Storage Tank Emissions Calculation Software); and 
      EPA documents.  

The DOS text files provide some basic information about the
contents and use of the CD-ROM.  The Air CHIEF, FIRE, TANKS, and
EPA documents files may be used to assist in finding and estimating
pollutant emissions.  Each of the types of files on the CD-ROM are
contained in separate directories.  The contents of the CD-ROM are
described in more detail below.


DOS TEXT FILES (Root Directory)

Contents.txt
      The Contents file briefly describes the entire contents of the
      CD-ROM.

Whatsnew.txt
      Whatsnew describes changes to the latest release of the CD-ROM.

Readme.txt
      Readme explains the equipment and procedures needed to
      start running the Air CHIEF interface-- Folio's
      BoundVIEWS.  


AIR CHIEF FILES 

      Air CHIEF version 4.0 provides EPA emission estimation guidance
documents and databases in the form of infobases that can be quickly
searched using the Folio BoundVIEWS software interface.  Air CHIEF
files include the user's manual, installation files, the Air CHIEF 
infobases, and the Air CHIEF user interface (Folio BoundVIEWS).

(Root Directory)

Airchief.wp
      This is the user's manual for Air CHIEF in WordPerfect 5.1
      format.
 
(CHIEF4 Directory)

Setup.exe 
      Folio's BoundVIEWS interface is used to access the Air
      CHIEF infobases.  To install this interface, run  "setup" from
      the "chief4" directory on the CD-ROM.  

Air CHIEF Infobases 

      AP-42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (5th
      Edition) Volume I:  The AP-42 infobases contain the entire
      contents of Volume I of the new AP-42 Fifth Edition.  Volume I 
      compiles emission factors and descriptions of activities that 
      produce criteria and toxic pollutant emissions for most stationary
      point and area sources along with Source Classification Codes 
      (SCCs) and Area and Mobile Source (AMS) codes for most of these
      sources.  (Volume II of AP-42, which contains information on
      mobile source emissions, is not included on Air CHIEF.)
      The emissions data in the AP-42 document have been
      gathered from source tests, material balance studies, and
      engineering estimates.  Each of the chapters is contained in a
      separate infobase on Air CHIEF.

      Locating and Estimating (L&E) Document Series:  The
      L&E documents are the result of an EPA program to compile
      and publish information on specific toxic air pollutants and
      the source categories for which these emissions have been
      characterized.  These reports are pollutant- or source-specific.
      Each of the L&E documents contained on Air CHIEF identify
      and quantify emissions from specific source categories and
      include general process descriptions, potential release points,
      and emission factors.  Each of the L&Es is contained in a
      separate infobase on Air CHIEF.

      FIRE Infobases:  The FIRE Criteria Pollutant Emission
      Factors and Air Toxic Pollutant Emission Factors infobases
      contain criteria and hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emission
      estimation factors, respectively, that relate the quantity of a
      pollutant released to some activity level from a specific
      source category or process.  The FIRE Criteria Pollutant
      Emission Factors infobase contains over 9,000 emission factor
      records used to estimate stationary, area, and mobile source
      emissions.  Emission factors are provided for seven criteria
      pollutants:  carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides,
      lead compounds, volatile organic compounds (VOC),
      particulate matter (PM), and particulate matter less than
      10 microns in diameter (PM10).  The FIRE Air Toxic
      Pollutant Emission Factor infobase contains over
      6,000 emission factors for numerous HAPs for stationary,

FIRE FILES (FIRE directory)

      The CD-ROM contains a Fire directory that contains the
installation program for FIRE.  The PC-based FIRE system contains
EPA's unique recommended criteria and toxic air emission
estimation factors.

Readme
      Readme explains FIRE requirements, how to install and run
      FIRE, and how to print the FIRE user manual.

Install.bat
      The install program will install FIRE on your hard disk,
      including the FIRE user manual.


TANK FILES (TANKS directory)

      The TANKS program is designed to estimate emissions of
organic chemicals from storage tanks.  The calculations are
performed according to EPA's AP-42, Chapter 12.  After the user
provides specific information concerning a storage tank and its
liquid contents, the system produces a report which estimates the
chemical emissions for the tank on an annual or partial year (no less
than one month) basis.  The user can also determine individual
component losses by using one of the speciation options available in
the program.

Q&atanks.txt
      This file contains question and answers for the use of the
      TANKS program.

Tanksman.zip
      This is the zipped user's manual for the TANKS program.

Readtnk.txt
      The Readme file for the TANKS program discusses some
      recent changes to TANKS.

Tanks2.zip
      This is the zipped version of the TANKS program that
      contains the installation program.  Do not unzip the files
      entitled program.zip and data.zip as these files are unzipped
      and placed in the appropriate directories by the installation
      program.


EPA DOCUMENTS FILES

      The CD-ROM contains EPA guidance documents for estimating air
pollutant emissions.  These documents include L&E's, AP-42, and AP-42
background documents in WordPerfect file format.  These WordPerfect
files are compressed on the CD-ROM in Zip file format.  These files
may be extracted from the Zip files using the PKUNZIP utility.  The
L&E and AP-42 documents are also included on Air CHIEF as infobases.

                      Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN):
          A U.S. Geological Survey Streamflow Data Set for the United
             States for the Study of Climate Variations, 1874-1988


<P>                   By J. R. Slack and Jurate Maciunas Landwehr


<P>


<P>                                   ABSTRACT
</center>

<P>Records of streamflow can provide an account of climatic variation over a
hydrologic basin.  The ability to do so is conditioned on the absence of
confounding factors that diminish the climate signal.  A national data set
of streamflow records that are relatively free of confounding anthropogenic
influences has been developed for the purpose of studying the variation in
surface-water conditions throughout the United States.  Records in the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Storage and Retrieval System
(WATSTORE) data base for active and discontinued streamflow gaging stations
through water year 1988 (that is, through September 30, 1988) were reviewed
jointly with data specialists in each USGS District office.  The resulting
collection of stations, each with its respective period of record
satisfying the qualifying criteria, is called the Hydro-Climatic Data
Network, or HCDN.  The HCDN consists of 1,659 sites throughout the United
States and its territories, totaling 73,231 water years of daily mean
discharge values.  For each station in the HCDN, information necessary for
its identification, along with any qualifying comments about the available
record and a set of descriptive watershed characteristics are provided in
tabular format in this report, both on paper and on computer disk
(enclosed). For each station in the HCDN, the appropriate daily mean
discharge values were compiled, and statistical characteristics, including
monthly mean discharges and annual mean, minimum and maximum discharges,
were derived. The discharge data values are provided in a companion report.


<P>
                              SUMMARY


<P>
The Hydro-Climatic Data Network -- HCDN -- has been defined and
constructed.  The HCDN is a national data set of relatively long streamflow
records that are predominantly free of anthropogenic influences.  These
records are suitable for the study of variation of surface-water conditions
in relation to climate variation over the last century, the period for
which gaged streamflow records are available.  To construct the HCDN, the
USGS WATSTORE data base, the primary repository of streamflow records for
the United States, was examined by a consistent set of criteria to identify
all suitable streamflow records.  With the assistance of surface-water
specialists in each State, a total of 73,231 water years of daily mean
discharge record at 1,659 gaging stations were identified as acceptable for
inclusion in the HCDN by the defining criteria.  This report identifies
those stations with their respective acceptable period of record, which
together constitute the HCDN.  In addition to information identifying the
stations, basin description information is also provided for each station.
The information is presented both in published tables in this report, and
in electronic format on the enclosed disk, entitled the Hydro-Climatic Data
Network Information Disk. For the acceptable water years, the daily mean
discharge data were extracted from WATSTORE and verified.  In addition to
compiling the daily mean discharges, the monthly and annual mean values
were computed, and the annual minimum and maximum values were identified
for each water year.  The streamflow data for the HCDN can be obtained
through the USGS NAWDEX Office.

<P>The data sets on this compact disc are a compilation of several
geographic reference data sets of interest to the global-change
research community.  The data sets were chosen with input from the
Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale
International Project (GCIP) Data Committee and the GCIP
Hydrometeorology and Atmospheric Subpanels.  The data sets include:
locations and periods of record for stream gages, reservoir gages, and
meteorological stations; a 500-meter-resolution digital elevation
model; grid-node locations for the Eta numerical weather-prediction
model; and digital map data sets of geology, land use, streams, large
reservoirs, average annual runoff, average annual precipitation,
average annual temperature, average annual heating and cooling degree
days, hydrologic units, and state and county boundaries.  Also
included are digital index maps for LANDSAT scenes, and for the
U.S. Geological Survey 1:250,000, 1:100,000, and 1:24,000-scale map
series.  Most of the data sets cover the conterminous United States;
the digital elevation model also includes part of southern Canada.
The stream and reservoir gage and meteorological station files cover
all states having area within the Mississippi River Basin plus that
part of the Mississippi River Basin lying within Canada.  Several
data-base retrievals were processed by state, therefore many sites
outside the Mississippi River Basin are included.



                                <H4>INTRODUCTION</H4>


<P>This Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)
Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP) Reference Data Set
(GREDS) compact disc contains several geographic reference data sets
of interest to the global-change research community.  The data sets
were chosen with input from the GCIP Data Committee and the GCIP
Hydrometeorology and Atmospheric Subpanels.  The data sets include:
locations and periods of record for stream gages, reservoir gages, and
meteorological stations; a 500-meter-resolution Digital Elevation
Model (DEM); grid-node locations for the Eta numerical weather
prediction model; and digital map data sets of geology, land use,
streams, large reservoirs, average annual runoff, average annual
precipitation, average annual temperature, average annual heating and
cooling degree days, hydrologic units, and state and county
boundaries.  Also included are digital index maps for LANDSAT scenes,
and for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 1:250,000, 1:100,000, and
1:24,000-scale map series.  A listing of Hydro-Climatic
Data Network (HCDN) stream gages (Slack and others, 1993)
also is included and may be related to the stream-gage site file
for locations and other information.


<P>Most of the data sets cover the conterminous United States; the DEM
also includes part of southern Canada.  The stream and reservoir gage
and meteorological station files cover all states having area within
the Mississippi River basin, plus that part of the Mississippi River
Basin lying within Canada.  Several data-base retrievals were
processed by state, therefore many sites outside the Mississippi River
Basin are included.


<P>A documentation file accompanies each data set, indicating the source
of the data, time frame with which it is associated, and other
information.  The stream gages, reservoir gages, and meteorological
stations are divided into two separate files for currently operating
or historical (discontinued) sites; sites with data for 1993 or later
(1992 for the Canadian hydrometric sites) are considered currently
operating unless otherwise indicated.  Sites may be discontinued at
any time.  The agency responsible for a site should be contacted to
determine if the sites are operational.


<P>The data sets are provided in at least two formats: a generic or
public-domain format; and ARC/INFO export files.  (Use of trade names
is for descriptive purposes only, and does not imply endorsement by
the U.S. Government.  ARC/INFO software was used in the development of
these data sets, and these original-format files are provided for the
convenience of users, in addition to the generic or public-domain
format files.)  The DEM is provided in ARC/INFO Grid (version 7.0.2)
format, rather than export-file format.


<P>Graphic images of the data sets also are provided in Graphics
Interchange Format (GIF) files.  GIF files are easily displayed on a
variety of computer systems using readily available display software.
These images provide a simplified view of the data sets available on
this disc, and may be used for browsing purposes.  The GIF files in
all cases portray significantly less spatial resolution and
information content than the actual data sets.


<P>Compilation and publication of this compact disc was funded by the
USGS Global-Change Research Program.  



<H4>                             DISC ORGANIZATION
</H4>

<P>This disc complies with the ISO 9660 standard for CD-ROM discs.  It is
intended for use with personal computers using the MS-DOS operating
system.  The disc is compatible with UNIX, Macintosh, and VAX
computers equipped with the appropriate CD-ROM reader and software.
All ASCII files, including Digital Line Graph (DLG) files and ARC/INFO
export files, use MS-DOS record delimiters (carriage-return,
line-feed).  Conversion of record delimiters in these files may be
necessary for operating systems other than MS-DOS.  The overall layout
of the disc is:

</Pre>

<H4>                            DATA-SET DOCUMENTATION
</H4>

<P>A README.TXT file exists in each directory, and provides an overview
of the contents of the files or subdirectories in the directory.  A
documentation file for each data set is located in the directory with
the data set, and is named with a file extension of &quot;.DOC&quot;.  The
documentation files comply with the Federal Geographic Data Committee
(FGDC) Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata, dated June
8, 1994.  The FGDC-compliant metadata files are very detailed
descriptions of the data sets, and include a narrative section
describing the procedures used to produce the data set in digital
form.  The FGDC-compliant metadata files are plain ASCII text
files.


<P>The ARC/INFO export-file versions of each data set contain the
documentation information used to create the FGDC-compliant metadata
files.  The DOCUMENT program, an ARC Macro Language (AML) program
jointly developed by the USGS, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA), and Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)
may be used to display, reference, or update the data set
documentation files.  Currently under development, support for the
DOCUMENT program is planned for future releases of ARC/INFO.
Pre-release versions of the program are planned, and may be made
available by anonymous ftp from the &quot;redlands.esri.com&quot; Internet site.
The DOCUMENT program works with ARC/INFO revisions 7.0.2 and 7.0.3.
Although the FGDC-compliant metadata files are intended to document
the public-domain-format (DLG or ASCII-tabular) files, the DOCUMENT
program produces metadata files that contain some ARC/INFO-specific
terminology.  Users are cautioned not to be confused by this
terminology.  The FGDC-compliant metadata files should contain enough
information to eliminate any confusion caused by the use of
ARC/INFO-specific terminology.



<H4>                                 FILE FORMATS
</H4>

<P>The data sets on this disc are stored in one of three generic or
public-domain formats, depending on the type of data represented.  The
stream gages, reservoir gages, and meteorological stations are treated
as points, and are stored in simple ASCII files, with fixed-field
columns.  Location is indicated by latitude and longitude, in decimal
degrees, and by Cartesian (X,Y) coordinates based on the Lambert
Azimuthal Equal Area map projection.  The Digital Elevation Model
(DEM) is stored as a raster image in I*2 integer (16 bit) format.
Other data sets (vector data) may be represented as either lines or
polygons on a map.  These data sets are stored in Digital Line Graph
(DLG) Version 3, Optional Format.  Some of the data sets stored in DLG
format have accompanying fixed-format ASCII files that contain
attribute data related to the lines or polygons defined in the DLG
file.  Complete descriptions of these related data files are contained
in the narrative sections of the metadata documentation files for the
associated data sets.  In addition to these generic or public-domain
formats, each data set is provided in ARC/INFO format, because
ARC/INFO was used in developing the data sets.



<H5>ASCII File format
</H5>


<P>The ASCII files are fixed record-length, fixed-field, plain text
files.  Most fields are separated by at least one space.  Fields not
completely filled are padded with spaces.  A complete description of
the fields for each file is in the accompanying metadata documentation
file for the data set. 



<H5>Raster Format
</H5>


<P>The DEM is stored in a generic raster file format with name
&quot;USCANDEM.BIL&quot; and ARC/INFO header file with name &quot;USCANDEM.HDR&quot;.
Also included is a label file named &quot;USCANDEM.LBL&quot;, for use by the
public domain IMDISP image-display software for MS-DOS personal
computers developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
California.  IMDISP users can access the DEM image by selecting the
label file.  The program will automatically access all the necessary
header information and retrieve the image data for display on the PC
screen.  More information about the DEM file format may be found in
the documentation file &quot;USCANDEM.DOC&quot;, which is stored in the
&quot;\TERRAIN&quot; directory with the DEM files.



<H5>Vector Format
</H5>


<P>The vector files on this disc are in the USGS Digital Line Graph,
Version 3 (DLG-3) optional format.  Designed for data interchange,
this format allows for the simple creation of a vector polygon or line
data structure.  The topological linkages are explicitly encoded for
node, area, and line elements.  The files are composed of 8-bit ASCII
characters organized into fixed logical records of 80 bytes.  A
detailed description of the DLG-3 optional format may be found in
U.S. Geological Survey (1990).



<H5>ARC/INFO Export Format
</H5>


<P>Each of the data sets were processed using the ARC/INFO software
package, and ARC/INFO export files are provided in the &quot;\XPORTARC&quot;
directory.  The export files were created using ARC/INFO Revision
6.1.1, running on a Data General AViiON workstation.  The &quot;NONE&quot;
compression option was used with the ARC/INFO EXPORT command, then the
resulting export files were compressed using the GNUZIP compression
utility.  The &quot;README.TXT&quot; file in the &quot;\XPORTARC&quot; directory lists the
original file sizes before compression.  The DEM was stored on the
disc in ARC/INFO grid format, using ARC/INFO version 7.0.2.



<H4>                            GEOMETRIC REGISTRATION
</H4>

<P>The Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area map projection was chosen for the
data sets on this disc.  This projection is appropriate for maps of
the North American continent because of its visual presentation and
equal-area characteristic, which facilitates areal analysis.  To the
best knowledge of the authors and contributors, all latitudes and
longitudes reported are based on the North American Datum of 1927
(NAD27), and all elevations reported are relative to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29).  However some latitudes and
longitudes may have been based on the newer North American Datum of
1983 (NAD83).  Horizontal differences may be as large as 300 meters
ground distance between points having identical latitudes and
longitudes based on NAD27 and NAD83.  Because many data bases
currently do not record datum information, it is possible that some
latitudes and longitudes may be based on NAD83.


<P>The Cartesian (X,Y) coordinate system cast on the Lambert Azimuthal
Equal Area map projection matches that used for the series of Advanced
Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite biweekly composite
CD-ROM's (Eidenshink, 1992), the Prototype 1990 Conterminous U.S. Land
Cover Characteristics Data Set (U.S. Geological Survey and Univ. of
Nebraska, 1993), and several other CD-ROM data sets produced by the
U.S. Geological Survey.  All the data sets on this CD-ROM may be used
with those data sets without coordinate transformation.  Table 1
provides map projection information.  The Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area
projection is implemented in spherical form by the software used
(Environmental Systems Research Institute, 1992).  The radius of the
sphere of reference is such that the sphere has the same surface area
as the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid, upon which the NAD27 is based (Snyder,
1987, p. 16).


<P>Many numerical weather models use a coordinate system based on a
spherical model of the earth.  The radius of the sphere used may be
different from the radius used for the data sets on this disc.  In
addition, the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid, which was used for the basis of
NAD27 and most currently available maps, was offset from a geocentered
position, in order to fit North America more closely (Snyder, 1987,
p. 12).  Conversion of latitudes and longitudes based on differing
ellipsoids or spheres may involve several steps.  The documentation
file for the Eta model (\ETAMODEL\ETAMODEL.DOC) contains a detailed
discussion of the process used to convert the Eta-model latitudes and
longitudes to coordinates that may be referenced to the other
map-based data sets included on this disc.

<H4>                              SOFTWARE
</H4>

<P>Because the global-change research community for which this CD-ROM is
primarily intended is very diverse and uses a variety of computer
equipment, the primary focus for this compact disc has been to provide
data sets in standard, generic formats.  The assumption is that the
individual user will be able to integrate the data sets into his or
her particular computer software and hardware environment.  In
general, no data-management or display software are provided.  The
International GEWEX office will maintain lists of sources of software
packages and other data sets which may be useful with this disc.


<P>Software is provided on this disc, however, for transforming
coordinates between latitude-longitude (NAD27) and Lambert Azimuthal
Equal Area coordinates.  Personal-computer executable programs and
C-language source code for these functions are provided in the
&quot;\SOFTWARE&quot; directory.  Also included is the entire FORTRAN source
code and documentation for the General Cartographic Transformation
Package (GCTP), can transform coordinates between any of the 24 map
projections supported (U.S. Geological Survey, 1991).


<P>Because some of the files have been stored on this disc in compressed
form, the GZIP program also is provided in the &quot;\SOFTWARE&quot; directory.
The GZIP program may be used to uncompress the compressed files.



<H4>                              ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
</H4>

<P>Numerous people and agencies contributed data sets and time to make
this disc possible.  Steve Williams and Linda Cully, of the University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), in Boulder, Colorado,
compiled the non-USGS meteorological-stations data set.  Terry Krauss
and his colleagues, of Environment Canada, were instrumental in
providing the Canadian hydrometric and climatological station catalogs
without restrictions on the distribution.  Richard Heim, of the
National Climatic Data Center, provided the data and original maps of
the Climatography of the United States.  Kenneth Mitchell, National
Meteorological Center, provided the Eta model grid.  David Maidment,
University of Texas at Austin, provided valuable consultation on
coordinate conversions for the Eta model grid.  Authors, contacts, and

DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA SET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


<P>The purpose of this data set is to provide paleoclimate researchers
with a tool for estimating the average seasonal variation in sea-ice
concentration in the modern polar oceans and for estimating the modern
monthly sea-ice concentration at any given polar oceanic location.  It is
expected that these data will be compared with paleoclimate data derived
from geological proxy measures such as faunal census analyses and stable-
isotope analyses. The results can then be used to constrain general
circulation models of climate change.


<P>The data contained in this data set are derived from the Scanning
Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave/
Imager (SSM/I) data produced by the National Snow and Ice Data Center
(NSIDC) at the University of Colorado in cooperation with the U.S.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The basic data come from
satellites of the U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite
Program.  NSIDC distributes three collections of sea-ice-concentration
grids on CD-ROM: data from the Nimbus-7 SMMR (October 25, 1978 through
August 20, 1987) are provided on volume 7 of the SMMR Polar Data series
(NASA, 1992); data from the SSM/I are provided on two separate volumes,
covering the periods from July 9 of 1987 to December 31 of 1989, and from
January 1 of 1990 through December 31 of 1991, respectively.  The NASATEAM
data from revision 2 of the SSM/I CD-ROM's were used to create the present
data set.  SMMR images were collected every 2 to 3 days, whereas SSM/I
data are provided in daily ice-concentration grids.  Apart from a number
of small gaps (5 or fewer days) in the record, the only long period for
which no data are available is December 3 of 1987 through January 12 of
1988, inclusive.


<P>This data set represents the results of calculations carried out on the
NSIDC data and also contains the source code of the programs that made the
calculations.  The objective was to derive monthly averages for the whole
13.25-year series and to derive a composite series of monthly averages
representing the variation of an average year.  The resulting file set
contains monthly images for each of the polar regions for each year,
yielding 160 files for each pole (one for each month from October 1978
through December 1991 except December 1987, and two each for July and
August of 1987), and composite monthly averages in which the years are
combined, yielding 12 more files.  Averaging the images in this way tends
to reduce the number of grid cells that lack valid data; the composite
averages are designed to suppress interannual variability.


<P>As ancillary data, the ETOPO5 global gridded elevation and bathymetry data
(Edwards, 1989) were interpolated to the resolution of the NSIDC data; the
interpolated topographic data are included.


<P>The images are provided in three formats: Hierarchical Data Format (HDF),
a flexible scientific data format developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications; Graphics Interchange Format (GIF); and
Macintosh PICT format.  The ice-concentration grids are distributed by
NSIDC in HDF format.


<P>Also included in the data set are programs that can retrieve seasonal ice-
concentration profiles at user-specified locations.  These nongraphical
data retrieval programs are provided in versions for UNIX, extended DOS,
and Macintosh computers.  Graphical browse utilities are included for the
same computing platforms but require more sophisticated display systems.

SUMMARY OF THE DIGITAL RASTER GRAPHICS PROGRAM

Various Federal agencies have experimented with, and in some cases sold,
different kinds of raster maps in the past few years.  Several private
companies offer similar products.

The USGS began investigating DRG's as a potential product in late 1993. 
Early prototypes showed a low-cost raster product was technically
feasible.  Meetings with and demonstrations for potential customers showed
that there is a demand for such a product.

The USGS proposed a DRG program for USGS standard quadrangles in early
1994.  The product name, DRG or Digital Raster Graphic, was already in use in
the cartographic community.  The USGS adopted this name rather than cause
confusion by establishing a new one.

Through the first part of 1994, the USGS produced a few dozen DRG's of its
1:24,000-scale topographic quadrangles.  These test maps were used for
demonstrations to other Federal and State government agencies.  This
helped to refine the requirements for a DRG product.

In October 1994, a "Product Development Report" on CD-ROM was released to
the public.  This report solicited comments from the users on the proposed
product.  The CD-ROM contained several dozen DRG's of standard USGS
quadrangles at 1:24,000, 1:100,000, and 1:250,000 scale, as well as
documentation, metadata, and examples of derivative products.

Mass production of USGS DRG's will be contracted by competitive bid. 
Production is expected to start in the spring or early summer of 1995.

DRG's will be made of standard USGS quadrangles at 1:24,000, 1:25,000,
1:100,000, 1:250,000 and (Alaska only) 1:63,360 scales.  The order and
rate of production will be determined by user requirements and by
partnerships with Federal and State agencies.

Although requirements of other Federal agencies are not fully documented
at this writing, full coverage of the contiguous 48 States likely will be
achieved in 1995 for 1:100,000- and 1:250,000-scale maps.  Full coverage
at 1:24,000 scale is expected in about 3 years.

Investigations into making DRG's of nonstandard maps are just beginning. 
The raster graphic concept extends easily to any kind of map, and DRG's of
thematic and historical maps will become important.  The Library of
Congress is exploring options for producing DRG's of its historical maps.

DRG's will initially be distributed on CD-ROM.  Each CD-ROM will include
technical and user documentation in addition to the DRG data and metadata. 
The data will initially be packaged in regularly shaped blocks; for
example, 1-degree squares (64 quadrangles) for 1:24,000-scale data. 
Network distribution for some types of product orders is being considered.

The USGS will also make DRG's available in SDTS format in 1995.  The
distribution media for these data have not yet been determined.

The initial production will be for the standard quadrangle series named
above.  Growth and expansion of production in coming years will be
determined by user requirements and the success of the initial production.

Many other government agencies at Federal, State, and even local levels
are working with products similar to DRG's.  Production may also involve
data exchange or cooperative agreement with these agencies.  By late 1994,
the USGS had entered into a cooperative production agreement with
California, had begun negotiations with Texas, and had conducted
preliminary discussions with several other States.

DESCRIPTION OF A DRG

A DRG is a raster image of a published map.  DRG's are made by scanning
published paper maps on high-resolution scanners.  The raster image is
georeferenced and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
projection.  Colors are standardized to remove scanner limitations and
artifacts.  The final data set is about 10 megabytes in Tagged Image File
Format (TIFF) with PackBit compression.  DRG's can be easily combined with
other digital cartographic products such as digital elevation models (DEM)
and digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ).

**************************************************************************

DISPLAYING A DRG

The Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) is a widely used raster file format
that is very general and flexible, and many different types of files meet
the standard.

The design objectives for the DRG included (1) getting the file sizes as
small as possible while maintaining image quality and (2) using a file
format that is common to imaging and GIS software.  The extent to which
the format used on this disc meets these objectives is still under
evaluation.  Comments from users are welcome.

The TIFF files on this disc can be read by either of the viewing software
packages included.  To facilitate the DOS and Windows environment, the
TIFF extension has been modified to a .TIF.  Likewise, the world file
extension has been modified to a .TFW.  To read the image files on this
disc in a UNIX environment, such as ARC Version 7.0, will require that the
image file extension be renamed from the .TIF extension to .TIFF.  To
georeference the image files will require that the world files be renamed
from the .TFW extension to .TIFW.  Several other UNIX-based imaging
packages can read this format, and investigations are nowhere near
complete.

Questions and comments from users about how these files can be used and
displayed are welcome (see USGS points of contact).  The USGS plans to
create and maintain a DRG Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list that will
be available from the Rolla Earth Science Information Center (ESIC) at
esic@mcdgs01.cr.usgs.gov.

How these data sets can be used on DOS PC's is still undetermined with
the noted exception of the ArcView Version 1.0 viewing software, and the
Aerial View Lite viewing software provided on this CD-ROM.  PC software
that operates on the DRG file format is readily available.  However, most
software tested so far has been unable to manage full-quadrangle images. 
PC image display software typically attempts to load a fully decompressed
image into memory, a strategy that cannot succeed with data sets as large
as a DRG, approximately 60 Mb uncompressed.

**************************************************************************

GEOREFERENCING INFORMATION

A number of proposals have recently been made by various organizations to
develop an industry-wide standard for specifying cartographic information
in TIFF tags.  These organizations include SPOT Image Corporation, NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Intergraph, and Environmental Systems Research
Institute (ESRI).  The USGS is following these developments and will
cooperate with efforts to standardize the use of TIFF tags for
cartographic information.

This early version of the DRG product, therefore, does not use the TIFF
tags to hold georeference data.  The metadata files that accompany the
data on this disc contain (among other things) the information needed to
correctly georeference the DRG.  The USGS invites comments, particularly
from GIS software vendors, on how this implementation could be improved by
using TIFF tags.

As an example of the current implementation:  to use a DRG in ARC/INFO, it
is necessary to build an ARC "world file."  The world file contains the
following information:

     x resolution
     amount of translation
     amount of rotation
     negative of the y resolution
     x ground coordinate of pixel 1,1 (upper left)
     y ground coordinate of pixel 1,1 (upper left)

An ARC world file is ASCII text and can be built with any text editor. 
ARC requires that the world file be named the same as the image file with
a "W" appended.  For example, if the image file is named G3807708.TIF,
the corresponding world file should be named G3807708.TFW.

Following are the contents of the world file for the data set G3807708.TIF
(Washington West, D.C., 1:24:000 scale) from this disc:

     2.4
     0
     0
     -2.4
     314724.486281
     4319320.265670

Ground resolution is 2.4 meters/pixel.  Translation and rotation are both
0.  The last two lines are the UTM values of the upper left pixel of the
data set.  These data are from the following locations of the metadata
file:

     *1.2.3         SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
     *4.1.2.4.2.1   ABSCISSA RESOLUTION (x)
     *4.1.2.4.2.2   ORDINATE RESOLUTION (y)
     *4.1.2.4.4     PLANAR DISTANCE UNITS

Many software packages are capable of displaying TIFF files without
georeferencing the data.  For example, when displayed using graphics arts
software, the DRG is a simple picture on a computer screen.

PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS

These specifications are not final.  Comments from users are welcome (see
USGS points of contact).

Source materials -

Standard series USGS paper maps or other materials that are suitable for
scanning.

Georeferencing -

The DRG raster-scan file is transformed to the theoretical UTM coordinate
positions of the published map's grid ticks:

     16 - 2.5-minute tick marks for the 1:24,000-scale series
     16 - 2.5-minute tick marks for the 1:25,000-scale series
          (7.5 minute x 7.5 minute series)
     28 - 2.5-minute tick marks for the 1:25,000-scale series
          (7.5-minute x 15-minute series)
     15 - 15-minute ticks in the 1:100,000-scale series
     45 - 15-minute ticks in the 1:250,000-scale series
     20 - 5-minute ticks on the 1:63,360-scale Alaska quadrangles

Scan resolution - 

Scanned at a minimum 500 dots-per-inch (dpi), resampled to 250 dpi during
final processing.

Map projection - 

To be consistent with other USGS digital data, the image is cast on the
UTM projection.  Therefore, the projection of the DRG will not always be
consistent with the credit note on the image collar.

Accuracy -

The DRG maintains the horizontal positional accuracy of the 7.5-minute
source map that meets National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Because 
it is fit to the theoretical quadrangle corners based on the UTM
projection, the DRG may have distortions outside the neatline. 

Color standardization - 

Each DRG generally will have a maximum of 12 indexed colors.

File format - 

TIFF version 5.0 using PackBit compression.  PackBit compression is
defined in Appendix C of version 5.0 of the TIFF standard (see
TIFF_STD.TXT in the DOCUMENT subdirectory).

Metadata -

DRG metadata contains information about the content, quality, condition,
and other data characteristics necessary for determining data
availability, access, and fitness for use.  Metadata is compliant to the
Federal Geographic Data Committee, 1994, Content Standards for Digital
Geospatial Metadata (June 8, 1994).

Distribution media -

Data sets at 1:24,000 scale will be stored on CD-ROM as 1-degree by
1-degree areas (64 quadrangles).  Distribution methods for other map
scales has not been determined.  Distribution on tape and by means of
network connection may be an option in the future.

**************************************************************************

DATA SET NAMING CONVENTION APPLIED TO DRG's (Primary Scales)

----------------------------Editor's Comment------------------------------

The naming convention used to name all data (image) files on this CD-ROM
does not agree with the naming convention discussed below.  To facilitate
the independent use of the CD-ROM, as opposed to forcing the user to copy
data (image) files to their systems hard-drive, and to allow the use of
the DOS environment viewing software, the three-character file extension
from the discussed C (cell descriptor) and SS (scale) has been changed to
a .TIF extension.  This occurs on this CD-ROM only.

                           SS = Scale (20,24,25,62,63,CK)     
        

DEFINITIONS:
        
DATA TYPE - One character alphanumeric identifier - DRG="G"
        
LAT/LONG OF SECONDARY CELL - Expressed in degrees of latitude (2 character) 
and degrees of longitude (3 characters), defining the southeast corner, 
(integer grid corner), of the secondary cell.   
        
SECONDARY CELL -  One-degree by one-degree cell defined by integer latitude
and longitude.  Cells in Alaska vary in size, but are always identified by
integer latitude and longitude, as shown in the "Index to Topographic and
Other Map Coverage," published by the USGS.
        
SECONDARY SERIES NUMBER - Two-character code, locating the primary cell
within the secondary cell. Separate system for Alaska 1:63:360-scale data
vs. the 49 States & territories.

     1) For the United States and its territories (excluding Alaska 
        1:63,360 scale) this is an integer value from 01 to 64 increasing 
        from left to right and top to bottom.  Each series number defines and 
        locates a unique primary scale cell as it falls on the 7.5-minute 
        grid.

     2) For 7.5- by 15-minute 1:25,000-scale series quadrangles covering
        limited geographic areas of the United States this is an even integer 
        value from 02 through 64 increasing from left to right and top to 
        bottom.  Each series number defines and locates a primary-scale cell 
        as it falls on the 7.5- by 15-minute grid.
             
     3) For Alaska 1:63,360-scale data the series identification is
        derived from the "Index to Topographic and Other Map Coverage."  The 
        naming scheme, for the Alaska primary-scale coverage (1:63,360), 
        consists of a two-character alphanumeric code, indexed alphabetically 
        from bottom to top and numerically from right to left.

     4) For 1:100,000-scale data the secondary series number is 01 for the
        northern one-degree by thirty-minute half (100K quad) of the 
        secondary cell and is 02 for the southern one-degree by thirty-minute 
        half (100K quad) of the secondary cell.
        
        (see examples of Secondary Cells and Index Schemes)


CELL DESCRIPTOR- One-character alphanumeric code describing the geographic 
                 cell size of the digital file, relative to the 7.5-minute 
                 grid.

                 Standard Size        = S
                 Double Size          = D
                 Oversize             = O        
                 Undersize            = U

SCALE/TYPE- Two-character code to identify the scale of the digital file,
            indicating the denominator in thousands (hundreds truncated). 

                 1:20,000-scale = 20
                 1:24,000-scale = 24
                 1:25,000-scale = 25
                 1:62,500-scale = 62
                 1:63,360-scale = 63

<TITLE>Bill Moffett</TITLE>

<body BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<center><H1>Death of<br>
William Andrew Moffet</H1></center>
<P>
We are sad to report the death of Bill Moffett.  The following information appeared in the April 1995 issue of <cite><B>College &amp; Research Libraries News</B></cite>:
<P>
William Andrew Moffett, director of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, died February 20 after a two-year battle with cancer.  He was 62.  A native of Charlotte, North Carolina, Moffett received his undergraduate degree from Davidson College, his M.A. and Ph.D. in history from Duke University, and his MLS from Simmons College.  Before joining the Huntington, he served as assistant professor of history at Alma College (1964-68) and at the University of Massachusetts (1968-1974), director of libraries for the State University of New York/College at Potsdam (1974-79), and the Azariah Smith Root director of libraries at Oberlin College (1979-90).
<p>
Moffett was an active member of ALA's Committee on Intellectual Freedom, the Duke University Libraries Board of Advisors, and the UCLA Graduate School of Library and Information Sciences Advisory Committee.  He was also active in ACRL, serving as its president from 1989 to 1990.  The recipient of many professional honors, Moffett was named ACRL's Academic or Research Librarian of the Year in 1993.  That same year he received ALA's Immroth Memorial Award for Intellectual Freedom, the Special Libraries Association's Professional Librarian of 1993 Award, and an honory doctor of laws degree from the SUNY/Potsdam.  The Simmons College Graduate School of Library and Information Science gave Moffett its Alumni Achievement Award in 1994.
<p>
Moffett is probably best known, professionally, for giving access to the Huntington's photographic archive of the Dead Sea Scrolls to qualified scholars in 1991, breaking a 40-year scholarly monopoly on Scrolls study.  A the time, Moffett said, "When you free the Scrolls you free the scholars.  Opening access to the Dead Sea Scrolls is an affirmation of the mission of research libraries:  not merely to store and preserve information, but to make it available in as free and unfrettered a way as possible."

<CITE>
         American Housing Survey, 1985:  National Core
         and Supplement File [machine-readable data file]

         distributor], 1992.</CITE>

<H6>Type of File</H6>

Microdata.

<H6>Universe Description</H6>

The universe consists of a sample of approximately 47,000
housing units selected from the 1980 Census of Population
and Housing records and updated by a sample of addresses
from building permits to include new construction and
conversions.

<H6>Subject-Matter Description</H6>

Statistics provided in this file focus on characteristics of
the housing inventory.  Data include year structure built,
type and number of living quarters, occupancy status,
access, number of rooms, presence of commercial or medical
establishments on the property, and property value.
Additional data focus on kitchen and plumbing facilities,
type of heating fuel used, source of water, sewage disposal,
heating and air-conditioning equipment, and major additions,
alterations, or repairs made to the property. Data relating
to housing expenses include monthly mortgage or rent
payments, utility costs, property insurance costs, garbage
collection costs, and the amount of real estate taxes paid
last year.  In addition, information is furnished on whether
the household received government assistance to help pay
heating or cooling costs or for other energy related
services.  Much of the same characteristics data are
presented for housing units previously occupied by recent
movers.<p>

Data provided include a supplement on indicators of housing
and neighborhood quality.  Indicators of housing quality
feature such items as privacy of bedrooms; condition of
kitchen facilities, walls, ceilings, and floors; electric
wiring; basement or roof water leakage; overall opinion of
the structure; and breakdowns of plumbing facilities and
equipment.  Characteristics indicative of neighborhood
quality are exterminator service, boarded-up buildings, and
overall opinion of the neighborhood.<p>

Supplements on second homes, mobility and energy assistance
are also provided.<p>

In addition to housing characteristics, data on age, sex,
race, marital status, income, and relationship to the
householder are available for each household member.
Additional data on years of school completed, Spanish
origin, length of residence, and tenure are provided for the
householder.

<H3>Associate Science Librarian for Carleton and St. Olaf Colleges</H3>

<P>Bon giorno!. As you can see from my title, I am the Science Librarian

at both campuses. By the way, feel free to call me &quot;Charlie.&quot;

</P>

<P>My responsibilities, in addition to the administration of two science

libraries, include: </P>

<UL>

<LI>Library instruction, often referred to as bibliographic instruction,

or simply B.I. This is the education of faculty and students in learning

the latest technologies in the sciences. </LI>

<LI>Collection development, which is a fancy way of saying I purchase books

and other appropriate materials. </LI>

<LI>Reference assistance in the disciplines of biology, chemistry, geology,

mathematics and physics. </LI>

</UL>

<P>As you can imagine, the &quot;digital age&quot; is making this one of

the most exciting times of this century. Along with these changes come

many questions. </P>

<P>My door(s) are always open. Feel free to contact me: </P>

<DD>Formerly known as the <CITE>Clearinghouse for Subject-Oriented Internet Resource Guides</CITE>, Argus
provides guides to Internet use by topic.

<A NAME="basics"><DT><A HREF="http://www.augsburg.edu/library/aib/">Internet Basics</A> by Karen Mateer
<DD>If you know nothing about the Internet and want to be introduced to it gently, this is the source for you.

<P>
<A NAME="scout"><DT><A HREF="http://www.augsburg.edu/library/scout/scout.html">Internet Scout Report</A>
<DD>The <CITE>Scout Report</CITE> is a weekly publication offered...to the Internet community as a fast, convenient
way to stay informed about network activities. Its purpose is to combine in one place selected new (and
newly-discovered) Internet resources.  A wide range of topics are included in the Report with an emphasis 
on resources thought to be of interest to...the research and education community.
<P>
<A NAME="tools"><DT><A HREF="http://www.december.com/net/tools/index.html">Internet Tools Summary</A> by John December
<DD>December is a world renowned Internet expert.  His resource...
"is a collection of information sources about software used on the Internet
for network information retrieval, computer-mediated interaction, and
computer-mediated communication." A popular resource for Internet trainers
and students to learn about the Internet, it uses some jargon that may be unfamiliar to
the uninitiated.  Nonetheless, it's an excellent site.

<P>
<A NAME="cite"><DT><A HREF="/instruction/eciting.html">Tips on Citing Internet Resources</A>
<DD>Scholars and students of all kinds are finding and using Internet resources, 
but citing these sources is a challenge because the citation format differs

advice about using the developing standards for Internet citation.

<CENTER><H2>Requesting St. Olaf Library Materials Electronically</H2></CENTER>
<P>
A new feature on PALS allows Carleton users to submit requests for St. Olaf library materials
electronically.  Use this feature as an alternative to submitting the <CITE>St. Olaf College 
Library Loan Request</CITE> paper forms located at the Gould Library Circulation Desk.
<P>
If the St. Olaf item you want is circulating to someone else, you may place a hold on it.  This
causes a recall notice to be sent to the current borrower of that item.  When the item returns
to the St. Olaf library, it will be sent to you.
<P>
Pick up a handout from the Gould Library's Reference Room for all the details, or 
<A HREF="olafcarlxg.jpg">view a scanned copy of the handout now.</A>
<P>
<STRONG>You must be registered with the St. Olaf Libraries to use this feature</STRONG>;
PALS will not accept your request without a valid St. Olaf barcode number.  To get a
St. Olaf library card, fill out a request form at our circulation desk, or travel
to the St. Olaf library and present your Carleton ID.  The St. Olaf library staff will
issue you a St. Olaf library card on the spot.
<P>
Note:  Science journals do not circulate, nor does the most current issue of each journal in
the Rolvaag Library (St. Olaf's main library).  To request individual articles from non-circulating
journals at St. Olaf, you must complete the <CITE>St. Olaf College Library Loan
Request</CITE> paper forms, still available at our circulation desk.
<P>
Filled requests are delivered via the Carleton/St. Olaf Exchange (usually within 1-2 days)
and will be held at our circulation desk for you to pickup.

<P>
Out here on the Electronic Frontier, folks don't always get credit for their work.  This
group of faithful student workers helps maintain the Carleton Library's WWW site.  Therefore, Terry Metz has
encouraged them to stake their claim to a small chunk of cyberspace to talk about themselves a bit.  So 
if you're curious about what today's small liberal arts college students are up to, interested 
in making new 'net friends, or just plain bored, take a look at their home pages.

Reply to: mnscu-pals@oasis.lib.umn.edu
To: mnscu-pals@oasis.lib.umn.edu, PALS-L@KNUTH.MTSU.EDU
Subject: Re: PALSTAC software using OCLC Passport driver

        *********************************
        *  The MNSCU-PALS Mailing List  *
        *********************************

*****************************************************************************
Disclaimer: The following is just a description of the process "I" followed
to be able to run PALSTac over TCP/IP.  It may or may not be "the" way to
do it, but it works for me, and I hope it will work for others.   J. Roca
                       --- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ---
*****************************************************************************

USING THE PASSPORT OPTN with PALSTac

To run the new PALSTac software using INT14 and establishing a connection
through your network card (rather than through the serial port) you may use
the drivers provided by OCLC for the PASSPORT software (if you already have
the PASSPORT software). (You may also buy LANWORKPLACE for DOS or Windows,
PC/FTP, or other TCP/IP programs, but it will cost $$$ for each station).

1) If you have the Passport software from OCLC you should request from OCLC
the additional no-charge software necessary for LAN access using Passport:
complete and send the LAN Drivers Diskette Request form at the end of the
Passport manual.

2) Once you have this diskette, run the INSTALL program and select the driver
TCP/IP (with the space bar).  The program OPTN.EXE will be added to
your PASSPORT directory.  Instructions for configuring PASSPORT OPTN are
in Chapter 6 of the Passport manual, section 6.7.

3) in the PASSPORT directory, you must create the file OPTN.CFG, which should
contain information on how to access the network, for example (the ip
numbers are fake, use your own):

my_ip = 113.134.134.123
netmask = 255.255.255.0
gateway = 134.134.134.254
nameserver = 134.134.134.1
domainlist = "yyy.zzz.edu"

again, this is also described in the PASSPORT manual.


4) Copy the files OPTN.EXE and OPTN.CFG to the PALSTac directory.

5) Create a batch file to start your PALSTac using OPTN.  The batch file
PALSP.BAT should look something like this:

C:
CD\PALSTAC
OPTN.EXE PALS.MSUS.EDU -p PALS.EXE -o MYPALS

(MYPALS is the name of a PALS configuration file.
If you don't include it, PALS.INI is the default
The -p option tells OPTN to run PALS.EXE after it
has completed a telnet connection.  The -o option
tells OPTN that MYPALS is a command line parameter
to be used with PALS.EXE).

6) Once PALSTac is open, go into SETUP and change your Communication method to
INT14.  Make sure you save it permanently for this station.

7) Your connection should now work through the net card.

8) IMPORTANT: You must notify the PALS Office of your IP subnet so that it can
be assigned to the "technical access" pool ports.  If this is not configured,
your telnet session to PALS.MSUS.EDU will only allow public access functions.

9) I hope I did not forget anything.  If someone finds a problem, please post.

Thanks!

<H1>The <I>Unofficial</I> Palstac FAQ</H1>
<HR>
</CENTER>
<H2>Disclaimer:</H2><B>This is an unofficial FAQ.  It should not in any 
way be construed to be the official word from PALS (although I invite 
and encourage them to provide additional information and to correct 
inaccuracies).  I've put this together as a public service.  Please keep 
in mind how much you paid for this information when you evaluate its 
usefulness and accuracy.  But please do <A HREF="mailto:salzman@stolaf.edu">

<H3>Introduction</H3>
I made the <I>mistake</I>, at the April, '96 <A HREF=
"http://www.msus.edu/pals/">MnSCU-PALS</A> Systems Librarians User Group
meeting, of saying that I thought that some sort of list of basic
connecting-to-PALS troubleshooting tips might be helpful for the group. 
<A HREF="http://www.lib.mankato.msus.edu/staff/roca/roca.html">Joan
Roca</A>, who was acting chair of the meeting, then asked if that meant
that I was volunteering to write one.  Most people in the room probably
had trouble hearing my response...  Thus, the <I>Unofficial</I> Palstac FAQ 
was born.

<A NAME="1"><B>What is Palstac?</B></A><P>
Palstac is the PALS <I><B>PALS T</B></I>echnical <I><B>A</B></I>ccess
<I><B>C</B></I>lient.  It is the DOS-based client software used by library
staff to perform technical processing functions at libraries which use the
PALS automated library system.  The software is workform-driven, and
interfaces with the Unisys mainframe-based PALS system.

<A NAME="2.1"><B>2.1  What are the hardware requirements for 
running Palstac?</B></A><BR><BR>

<A NAME="2.4">
From the MnSCU-PALS document dated April, 1996:

<PRE>
Minimum requirements to run Palstac software

   Hardware:  386 IBM-compatible PC
              4 MB RAM
              500K free conventional memory
              3 MB free disk space
              VGA monitor
</PRE>

It's my experience that Palstac runs fine (although slowly) on 386's with
2 MB RAM, and I assume that it will run on a 386 with 1 MB RAM.  It's hard
to find new PC's with less than 4 MB's RAM these days.  I assume that as
long as you have at least 500K free RAM, Palstac will run okay, regardless
of how much total memory you have on your system.  Please let me know if
this is your experience so I can update this section.<P>

If you wish to run Palstac via telnet, you will need a network adapter and
a connection between your PC and the Internet (probably through your 
institution's campus network).

In the who-has-time-to-mess-with-this-stuff-department, it's possible, at
least in theory, to run Palstac via telnet over a dialup SLIP or PPP
connection (for some details about how you might go about doing something
like this, you might want to check out the <A HREF=
"http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/text/faq/usenet/ibmpc-tcp-ip/faq.html">
comp.protocols.tcp-ip.ibmpc FAQ</A>.  Telecommuters of the world, unite!  
Please let me if you have any experience with this so I can update this 
section.

Reply to: mnscu-pals@oasis.lib.umn.edu

Subject: PALSTAC/telnet won't run under Mac/SoftWindows 2.0

        *********************************
        *  The MNSCU-PALS Mailing List  *
        *********************************


FYI for those of you who might have been interested in running PALSTAC via
telnet on a Mac under SoftWindows.  I tried it a few months ago, and it
doesn't appear that it will work.  I didn't find any information relevant
to running an Int 14 redirector under SoftWindows in the printed
documentation, or on Insignia Solutions' (the publisher of SoftWindows)
website, and the technical support staff were not helpful, either. 

If you think about what an Int 14 redirector does, and about how 
SoftWindows works, it seems to make sense that this shouldn't work.  
Since SoftWindows doesn't have to, and probably can't, emulate a 
PC-compatible BIOS, it doesn't seem like it would work with a program 
which redirected PC-compatible BIOS Int 14 calls.

While I don't think PALSTAC via telnet can run under SoftWindows on a 
Mac, if anyone else wants to try, and gets it to work, I'd appreciate 
hearing about it.  I think others on the list would be interested as well.


P.S.  This is just an FYI.  I'm not suggesting that PALS ever claimed 
that PALSTAC would run on a Mac.

</PRE>

According to the <I>MnSCU/PALS 1996 Development Schedule</I>, dated April,
1996, Winsock compliance for Palstac is a top priority, scheduled for
release in July, 1996.  <A HREF=
"http://www.insignia.com/marcom/macprod.html">SoftWindows</A> 2.0 is
supposed to be able to run Winsock compliant applications, so a Winsock
compliant Palstac <I>might</I> run under SoftWindows 2.0 (SoftWindows 3.0
and SoftWindows 95 are now available, but the Insignia home page doesn't
specifically indicate that these versions support Winsock.  I can't see
how they wouldn't, though).  If Winsock compliance is implemented through
some sort of interface between an Int 14 redirector and a Winsock stack
then Palstac probably won't run under SoftWindows.<P>

Again, PALS has never claimed that Palstac will run on a Mac under
SoftWindows.  Try it at your own risk, and share your experiences, please.

<A NAME="3.1"><B>3.1 Which kind of hardware upgrades will make Palstac run
faster?</B></A><BR><BR>
I once experimented with running Palstac off a RAM disk (a RAM disk is a
"virtual" disk drive created in RAM through the use DOS device drivers --
see your DOS manual for details).  I seem to recall that I didn't notice
any difference in performance between running Palstac from a RAM disk and
running it from a hard disk.  (By "performance", in this context, I'm
referring to how long it takes for Palstac workforms to appear on screen.)
This would seem to indicate that disk throughput isn't a significant
factor in Palstac performance.  However, we've recently begun to run
Palstac from a network file server, rather than from a local hard drive,
and this seems to have improved performance on our 386's.  The only
conclusion I can think of to draw from this is that the greater speed of
the file server's hard drive contributed to faster retrieval of Palstac
workforms.  My impression is that performance is essentially unchanged on
486's and Pentiums which load Palstac from a network drive.  If anyone has
any observations to share on this topic, please let me know. 
<BR>
<A HREF="#toc"><B>Back to Table of Contents</B></A>
<BR><BR>


<A NAME="3.2"><B>3.2 Is it possible to run Palstac off a network drive on
a LAN?</B></A><BR><BR>
Yes, for <I>most</I> functions.  The Palstac MARC editing functions do 
not yet work across a LAN (even thought you can tell the configuration 
file, pals.ini, to use a local drive to import records).  My 
understanding is that this may be fixed in the next release, which is 
scheduled for July '96.  If you want it to be part of the next release, 
<I>let PALS know</I>.<P>

At St. Olaf, we've recently begun to run Palstac off a network drive, over
a LAN, except for our catalogers' PC's, which run it off their local hard
drives.  The biggest advantage of doing this is that, when new releases of
Palstac are available, we can update the copy of Palstac on the network
drive, and most of the staff will be running the latest release.  In other
words, our Windows 95 icons point at a copy of Palstac which resides on a
network file server's hard drive.  See question <A HREF="#3.1">3.1</A> for
some observations on the performance implications of this
configuration.<P>

One thing you'll need to consider when running Palstac on a LAN is how to
allow each user to have their own individual copy of the <I>pals.ini</I>,
Palstac configuration file.  Since we run Palstac via telnet using the 
optn Int 14 redirector, I use the following syntax in our batch file:<BR><BR>

<CENTER>h:\palstac\optn pals.msus.edu -p h:\palstac\pals.exe -o 
c:\palstac\pals.ini
</CENTER><BR>

This says: run optn (in the palstac directory on the h: drive) as the
telnet driver, make the telnet connection to pals.msus.edu, when you're
connected, use the pals.exe program (in the palstac directory on the h:
drive) as the communication program, and use the pals.ini file (in the
palstac directory on the c: drive) as the configuration file for the
pals.exe program.

<BR><BR>


<A NAME="3.3"><B>3.3  Is it possible to multitask Palstac with Winsock
applications?</B></A><BR><BR>
From the <I>MnSCU/PALS 1996 Development Schedule</I>, dated April, 1996:

<PRE>
PALSTAC:
Winsock Compliance               April - July, 96
</PRE>

So it appears that the next version of Palstac, scheduled to be released
in July, 96, is intended to be Winsock compliant.  In the meantime, you
might also want to check out a configuration we've been using at the St.
Olaf Libraries, which allows us to multitask Palstac with Winsock
applications.  We've been running this configuration, since 12/95, under
Windows 95, and it has been pretty stable.  <A HREF=
"pals_pktmux.html">More details</A> are available. 
<BR>
<A HREF="#toc"><B>Back to Table of Contents</B></A>
<BR><BR>


<A NAME="3.4"><B>3.4  How do I use the optn Int 14 redirector with
Palstac?</B></A><BR><BR>
The basic syntax for using optn with Palstac looks something like:<P>
<CENTER>optn pals.msus.edu -p c:\palstac\pals
</CENTER><P>
If you want to use an alternate Palstac configuration file (the default 
is <I>pals.ini</I> in the directory from which Palstac was run), you need 
to add something like <TT>-o c:\palstac\myconfig.ini</TT> to the end of 
the above command line.  <A HREF=
"http://www.lib.mankato.msus.edu/staff/roca/roca.html">Joan Roca</A> posted
a message to the MnSCU-PALS list in October, 1995, which described the 
use of optn in <A HREF="optn.html">greater detail</A>.
<BR>
<A HREF="#toc"><B>Back to Table of Contents</B></A>
<BR><BR>


<A NAME="3.5"><B>3.5  What should I enter in the CTC workform for Default 
Search Institution, Default Search File and Default Search Subfile?</B></A>
<BR><BR>
If you want the Terminal ID you're configuring to default to searching your
own institution's catalog, the following should work (it's what works at
St. Olaf):<P>

<PRE>
     Default Search Institution     :soc   [use your own PALS library symbol]
     Default Search File            :cat
     Default Search Subfile         :**
</PRE>

More information on values to enter into these fields can be obtained by 
pressing &lt;F1&gt;, while your cursor is in these fields in the CTC 
workform.

<BR>
<A HREF="#toc"><B>Back to Table of Contents</B></A>
<BR><BR>


<A NAME="4.1"><B>4.1  Why do I see that "WARNING: Printer not ready, printer 
may not work" message?</B></A>
<BR><BR>
If you've configured Palstac, under System | Setup | Printer | Printer
Type, as <B>P</B> (for parallel printer), and the printer isn't powered on
or connected to the specified parallel port (also an option on the same
Setup menu), you'll see this message after you press <B>&lt;Enter&gt;</B>
at the Palstac logo screen.  If you don't have a printer attached to your
PC, you should select a Printer Type of <B>F</B> (for print to a file). 
Doing so will stop this message from appearing.<P>

I don't know whether or not Palstac looks for a signal from a serial 
printer, so I can't say whether or not you might see this message if you 
have a serial printer which isn't connected or powered on.  Can anyone 
comment on this?
<BR>
<A HREF="#toc"><B>Back to Table of Contents</B></A>
<BR><BR>


<A NAME="4.2"><B>4.2  Why is the data in some workforms garbled when I try 
using Palstac via telnet?</B></A><BR><BR>
Depending upon which Int 14 redirector you're using, you may need to 
change the "echo terminator" character in your Palstac setup.  You can do 
this on the System | Setup | Communications Menu.  If you're using the 
OCLC <I>optn</I> redirector, then you should set the echo terminator to 
<B>10</B>.<P>

Gary Lundin suggested a simple test at the April '96 Systems Librarians
User Group meeting.  Do two consecutive <I>time</I> commands.  If there is
a blank line between the output of the two commands, you probably need to
change your echo terminator character to <B>10</B>.  We need more simple, 
straightforward troubleshooting tips like this!
<BR>
<A HREF="#toc"><B>Back to Table of Contents</B></A>
<BR><BR>


<A NAME="5.2"><B>5.2  When will we no longer need to use PAD's at all?</B></A>
<BR><BR>
This question was discussed briefly at the April '96 Systems Librarians
User Group meeting.  My understanding is that the following few
developments need to take place before a library will be able to perform
all of their PALS-related activities via TCP/IP (i.e., telnet) 
connections, and will no longer need to use PAD's:

<OL>
<LI>some problems with the MARC editing functions in Palstac need to
be fixed
<DT>- scheduled for inclusion in the July '96 release of Palstac?
<LI>PALS software updates need to be made available via FTP (this would
provide an alternative to using Masterlink)
<DT>- FTP links are scheduled
to be added to PALS home page when a new UNIX-based computer is acquired
to run the WebPALS server software -- sometime in fall '96?
<LI>new remote printing software needs to be tested and found reliable 
over TCP/IP connections (this would replace/enhance the Psystem-based PC 
Print software?)
<DT>- I don't recall hearing a specific estimate on a time frame for this 
-- anybody?
</OL>

Subject: Multitasking PALSTAC/telnet with Winsock app's


[I've delayed sending this message out because there is a serious problem
with this configuration.  Using this configuration, under Windows 95 with
Trumpet Winsock v2.0 Rev B and Netscape v1.22, telnet helper applications
can't be automatically launched by clicking on telnet URL's.  I haven't
had a chance to look into this yet.  Netscape appears to work fine, and
telnet applications which are started directly appear to work fine, too. 
Yes, I think that this is *unacceptable*, but this appears to be the price
of running PALSTAC.  I feel that it's preferrable to rebooting, and using
multiple configurations for PALSTAC and Winsock applications.]


It looks like I have a configuration which will allow PALSTAC to run, via
telnet, simultaneously with Winsock applications.  This is made possible
through the use of a utility called 'pktmux'.  Since, at St. Olaf, we're
in the process of migrating to Windows 95 and we're using OCLC's
'optn.exe' Int14 TCP/IP redirector, my configuration is designed for these
two elements.  My guess is that this configuration will probably work with
whatever Int14 redirector you're using, and with Windows 3.1/3.11 (but see
the disclaimer in section 1 of the 'pktmux' documentation).  Of course,
this information is offered for informational purposes only, and neither
St. Olaf College nor I can accept any responsibility for any damages
resulting from your use of this information.  In other words, use at your
own risk. 

Pktmux is, according to its accompanying documentation, "...a program that
provides a multiplexing interface to a Packet Driver. It thus allows
several IP protocol stacks to be run in parallel either under DOS or a
control program such as Windows..."  A "packet driver" is the de facto
standard way of providing network applications with an interface to
network cards, regardless of the card's manufacturer.  Packet drivers
talk, on one side, to the network card, and on the other side, to network
applications, always presenting the same, generic, packet driver interface
to applications.  Pktmux works by providing "virtual packet drivers", in
the form of its 'pktdrv.exe' utility, which can make network applications
think that they're the only network applications running.  But the real
trick that pktmux performs is to examine IP data packet headers and guess
which applications should receive them.  When its guesses are successful,
you can run multiple TCP/IP protocol stacks simultaneously, such as an
Int14 redirector for PALSTAC and a Winsock for Windows-based Internet
applications. 

I've been testing the use of pktmux with OCLC's 'optn.exe' Int14
redirector, PALSTAC (v8R2.D03) and Trumpet Winsock v2.0 Rev. B (using
bootp), and it seems to be pretty reliable.  We're running Windows 95.

Following are copies of the auotexec.bat and config.sys files we're using
at St. Olaf.  Note that even with Windows 95 you *must* load some 16-bit,
real mode drivers, as indicated below, in order for PALSTAC to work via
telnet.  We use a Novell ODI network driver stack -- you should be able 
to just load the 'pktmux' and 'pktdrv' commands after all of your other 
network drivers are loaded.


CONFIG.SYS
==========
device=c:\windows\himem.sys
device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems
dos=high,umb
devicehigh=c:\windows\setver
fileshigh=40
buffershigh=10
lastdrivehigh=z

(Note: In Windows 95 you can use the command "dos=auto", and 'himem.sys'
will automatically be loaded and the "high" version of 'files', 'buffers',
etc. will automatically be used, but it seems less confusing to explicitly
load the above configuration.)


AUTOEXEC.BAT
============
@echo off
path=c:\windows;c:\windows\command
set temp=c:\temp

cd \network
lh c:\network\lsl
lh c:\network\3c5x9
c:\windows\odihlp.exe
lh c:\network\odipkt 0 96

lh c:\network\pktmux 8 60 /4p
lh c:\network\pktdrv /lt


Note that I was able to free the largest amount of conventional memory by
loading a combination of 16-bit, real mode drivers (ie, lsl.com and our
ODI card driver) and 32-bit protected mode drivers (I configured Windows
95's GUI to load the Microsoft Client for Netware and Microsoft's IPX/SPX
Compatible Protocol).  This configuration resulted in 80K more free
conventional memory than when I loaded the 16-bit real mode version of all
of the above in autoexec.bat (even when I tried to load everything into
high memory).  Note that under Windows 95 you *must* load a real mode
driver for your network card in order for PALSTAC to work with an Int14
redirector. 

Another part of our configuration is the following batch file, which we  
use to run PALSTAC (note that we use OCLC's 'optn.exe' INT14 redirector):


OPTNPALS.BAT
============
@echo off
lh c:\network\pktdrv /nesss
c:\palstac\optn pals.msus.edu -p c:\palstac\pals
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<I>Note: As of April '96, St. Olaf is beginning to run PALSTAC off a 
network drive.  For details (i.e., the above batch file looks different), 
please see question <A HREF="palstac_faq.html#3.2">3.2</A> in the <A HREF=
"palstac_faq.html"> PALSTAC FAQ</A>.</I>
<HR>
<P>
<PRE>
Now for the explanation of the 'pktmux' and 'pktdrv' commands:

'Pktmux' is loaded in autoexec.bat with the following line:

             lh c:\network\pktmux 8 60 /4p

This command loads 'pktmux' into high memory (if possible), above the 640K
of conventional memory, and allocates a total of 8 "channels"  for
'pktdrv's, uses interrupt 60, and allocates a total of 4 buffers for
'pktdrv's.  I used 8 channels ('pktmux' communicates with its 'pktdrv'
virtual drivers via "channels") and only 4 buffers to try to save some
memory, since I only expect to need a maximum of 4 channels (for 4
'pktdrv's) at any given time.

The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that if users exit PALSTAC by
closing its window, rather than by using the correct "end", then
&lt;Alt+Q&gt;  commands, PALSTAC will not be allowed to exit correctly,
and will therefore not be able to release the 'pktdrv' it used.  This will
keep the 'pktdrv' and/or its channel on 'pktmux' "busy", and if you only
load, say 2 'pktmux' channels and 2 'pktdrv's, in autoexec.bat -- one for
Winsock and one for Int14/PALSTAC -- and a user exits incorrectly as
described above -- they will not be able to run PALSTAC again without
rebooting, since they will not have a free virtual packet driver (ie,
'pktdrv').  The 8 'pktmux' channels allow for a few channels to be tied up
by incorrect exits from PALSTAC, while the 4 buffers are enough to serve 4
'pktdrv's efficiently without wasting memory (for additional buffers). 
The 4 'pktdrv's I anticipate are for: Winsock, an OCLC Passport for DOS
session, and two simultaneous PALSTAC sessions.  I'm sure you can think of
numerous ways in which multiple simultaneous PALSTAC sessions can come in
handy.  This configuration also supports multiple simultaneous OCLC
Passport sessions, along with PALSTAC and Winsock applications. 

The /p option to 'pktmux' causes the display (and autoexec.bat) to pause
if an error is encountered in loading 'pktmux'.

The next line in autoexec.bat is

                  lh c:\network\pktdrv /lt

This command loads the first 'pktdrv' (into high memory, if possible) and 
tells it to "listen" for all types of TCP packets.  I think that this makes 
it somewhat more efficient by ignoring non-TCP (ie, Novell IPX) packets.
This 'pktdrv' will always be used, according to the way I've configured 
things, by Winsock, since I have Windows 95 set up to load Winsock 
automatically, every time our PC's boot (this can be done by placing a 
shortcut to 'tcpman.exe' in the Startup folder).  Another reason that I 
load Winsock automatically is that, in my experience, Trumpet Winsock 
v2.0 Rev B will not "demand load" when used with 'pktmux' under Windows 
95 (this means that double clicking on a Winsock application will not 
automatically start up Winsock).

The batch file that we use to start PALSTAC includes the following two lines:

            lh c:\network\pktdrv /nesss
            c:\palstac\optn pals.msus.edu -p c:\palstac\pals

(Note that the Windows 95 shortcut (sort of a like a Windows 3.x PIF) that 
I use sets the working directory to c:\palstac.  If you don't do this, 
you'll need to add something like the following to the beginning of this 
batch file: cd \palstac.)

The first command loads a 'pktdrv', but only if it is "necessary". 
'Pktdrv' "expands" its search for any other free 'pktdrv's from the
current DOS session to all other DOS sessions on the computer.  This
prevents multiple 'pktdrv's from being loaded unnecessarily, but allows as
many new 'pktdrv's as needed to be loaded via this batch file (up to a
limit of available channels on 'pktmux' -- in this case, 8).  The three
's's suppress all messages, warnings and error messages.  There is a "/p" 
option, which pauses the display if any errors (or, apparently, warnings)
are encountered, but the condition of another free 'pktdrv' being found is
considered to be an error (or a warning), and I found that the display
paused every time that PALSTAC was started with this batch file (with the
"/p" option).  So I removed it.  The problem with not using "/p" is that,
if a user manages to tie up all 8 'pktmux' channels PALSTAC will not load,
and the error message will disappear too quickly for them (or you) to be
able to read it (since the window will automatically close when PALSTAC
can't load).  However, since there is no totally reliable way to free up
"busy" channels on 'pktmux' anyway, it doesn't really matter what the
error message says; they'll probably have to reboot if they tie up all of
their available 'pktmux' channels. 

The next line in optnpals.bat starts OCLC's 'optn.exe' Int14
redirector/telnet driver, tells it to connect to PALS, and tells it that
the program it should run is PALSTAC, rather than its default (OCLC's
Passport program). 


Getting a copy of PKTMUX
========================

I've searched for ftp sites which offer the latest version of 'pktmux', 
v1.2i, but have been unable to identify any.  So I am making available 
this version of 'pktmux' via the following methods:

Anonymous FTP:

on the host:       ftp.stolaf.edu
in the directory:  /pub/tmp
as the file:       pktmx12i.exe
URL:               ftp://ftp.stolaf.edu/pub/tmp/pktmx12i.exe


WWW:

along with the text of this message (including live FTP link):

http://www.stolaf.edu/people/salzman/pals_pktmux.html


Pktmx12i.exe is a "self-extracting archive" file, which means that it's
like a PKZIP'ed file, except that you don't need an external utility to
expand it.  Once you've retrieved a copy of 'pktmux', create a separate
directory for it (always a good idea when you expand compressed archive
files).  Then expand the archive file by typing it's name on the DOS 
command line.  Alternatively, if you're a point-and-click type, you can 
just double-click on pktmx12i.exe, from within File Manager or Windows 
Explorer (depending upon your version of Windows).

The rest of the installation and use of 'pktmux' is described above, and
in the 'pktmux' documentation.  If you don't understand some of this,
please ask your local institution's technical support personnel for
assistance.  I'll be happy to try to help you any way I can, but please 
remember that there are other people who get paid to do that, and that 
I'm just as swamped as you are.

Hope this helps.

P.S.  Please note the problem with launching telnet applications from 
telnet URL's described at the beginning of this message.

P.P.S. For those who care: The reason that I'm using a 16-bit Winsock with
Windows 95 is that St. Olaf uses the bootp protocol to dynamically assign
IP addresses.  Windows 95's Microsoft TCP/IP stack only provides native
support for the DHCP protocol, not for bootp.  I ran into problems with
DHCP IP address lease time, when the DOS-based TCP/IP stack would request
an IP address.  When this happened, Microsoft TCP/IP would terminate, and 
it would terminate all Winsock-compliant applications as well.  I think 
that Microsoft has a patch for bootp support at their ftp site, which 
I'll have to look into some day.  It was simpler to try the 16-bit 
Trumpet Winsock and get things working, at least at a basic level.  Now 
that JAVA has become popular, it's more important that I get a 32-bit 
Winsock-compliant stack working, since I don't believe that there will be 
any 16-bit WWW browsers which will support JAVA.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>International Outreach (IO) was founded by Stuart Gramenz of Australia to reach India with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Stuart was involved in holding large evangelistic crusades, "Jesus Heals Campaigns", to achieve this. The immediate results were very encouraging, with thousands upon thousands responding to the Gospel, but this gave rise to a new challenge - FOLLOW UP, the answer being to train the nationals to reach their nation. Stuart met P. D. Prasada Rao at a crusade in Hyderabad and discovered they both had a vision to train the nationals of India. This resulted in the establishment of the Ministry Training College in 1983.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>Messiah College exists to further the liberal arts and the evangelical Christian faith. As a growing community of teachers and learners, we believe that faith and reason complement one another within the Christian framework of education and the quest for truth. Just as insight in the academic disciplines often comes by intuitive leaps of imagination which can then be tested and examined, the faith assumptions of a Christian may be examined for their consistency with the body of supernaturally revealed truth. To encourage students to discover the unity of faith and life, our major four-fold goal lies in the spiritual development, intellectual development, career development, and personal development of each student. Through such an education, students can better serve God and society as whole persons.</FONT>

In spite of the growing emphasis on pluralism in Canadian society, Christian thought and morality still pervade most of our public institutions. Our country's emphasis on justice, fairness, and freedom are deeply Christian concepts. Students come to Providence College primarily for the Christian content of the teaching it provides. Although the school enjoys a reputation for academic excellence, this excellence is viewed as a means to an end, and not the end itself. Still true to its roots in the Bible College movement, Providence requires its students to study the Bible as a textbook, coming to grips with hard questions about life and society and learning to consistently apply their faith to their daily lives.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>the goal of the UofN is to prepare Christians for missionary service and discipling the nations, not merely to grant degrees to academically qualified students. This goal has had a major role in determining how the University is structured and organised. Instead of dividing their attention between 4 or 5 different subjects a quarter, students in the UofN concentrate in-depth on one 12-week course at a time, often followed by a 12-week field assignment, where they can actually put the theory into practice. Students benefit from small class sizes, as well as living in community with the course leaders and instructors. Each week the curriculum provides for times of worship and intercession, small group interaction, and one-on-one involvement with leaders, as well as lectures and assignments on the topic of the course. Because the goal is not just a degree, students are free to take the courses which interest them and will help them to be effective in the ministry to which God has called them, whether these courses lead to a degree or not. And for those students who want to pursue a degree, courses can often be taken in just about any order, in any time frame, at many locations around the world. For there is no one single campus for the UofN, although a primary campus is in Kona, Hawaii. There are currently 210 locations where UofN courses are offered, on every continent. In fact, degree students are required to take courses on at least two continents, and are encouraged to study in as many different countries as possible. Because there is no time limit on when they have to complete their degree, they are also encouraged to not just take one course right after another, but to actually work on the mission field and gain experience between courses.</FONT>

Sins of the past</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A group of Christians has begun an 800-mile prayer expedition through Georgia and the Carolinas</B> to break &quot;spiritual strongholds&quot; there. The walkers, who set out Oct. 1, will &quot;retrace the path of  destruction inflicted by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's army during the Civil War.&quot; Union soldiers burned towns and farms, killed livestock, and committed atrocities as they cut a 60-90 mile swath through the region in 1865. <BR> <B>...Sherman left a bitter spiritual legacy that remains to this day</B>, contributing to the existence of  racism, lingering regional animosities, and occult sites, said walk organizer Gene Brooks of Global Harvest Ministries. Prayer &quot;intercessors&quot; will ask forgiveness for the Union soldiers' deeds and petition God to &quot;clear this obstacle to nationwide revival and spiritual awakening in the United States.&quot; Brooks, who has done an extensive study of the region's history, scouted the march's path last year in preparation for the Oct. 1-Nov. 15 walk. <BR> <B>...The march is one of several around the world</B> by Christians who are &quot;walking, praying, repenting, and forgiving in a global air assault on the Kingdom of Darkness,&quot; Brooks said. In Europe, Christians began a 2,000-mile, three year walk in April to retrace the steps of the 11th-century Crusaders in order to apologize to Muslims and Jews for atrocities committed. The Reconciliation Walk proceeds along several paths through the Balkans and Turkey. Walkers plan to converge in Jerusalem in July 1999.  <BR> <B>...A formal declaration of apology to Muslims</B> already has resulted in several instances of reconciliation among Muslims and Christians. In Cologne, Germany, 125 Christians presented a written apology to 200 Muslim clerics. A senior imam, or Muslim teacher, accepted it and sent copies of  the statement to 600 mosques throughout the continent. Marchers also read the statement in Ravensbruck, Germany, site of a Nazi concentration camp. Two days later, a delegation from the Ravensbruck synagogue told the marchers that since the apology was read, &quot;they didn't know what had happened, but they had been crying continually,&quot; marcher Cathy Nobles said. At a Turkish church on Sept. 1, Muslim converts to Christianity asked forgiveness for their hatred of Christians. They had been taught stories of the Crusaders and always had feared and distrusted Westerners -- even fellow Christians -- they said.  <BR> <B>...The response to the walks has been positive</B>, although some Christians question the theological basis for Christians to confess sins of  their predecessors. But when forgiveness and reconciliation occur, theological debates become secondary, one scholar said. <BR>      </font></p>

Christian pastor killed in Iran</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>An Iranian Christian pastor reportedly was killed in Iran</B> on or about Sept. 25, Iranian Christians International reported. Pastor Mohammed Ravanbakhsh's body was found hanging on a tree in a forest near Ghaem-Shahr, ICI said. He reportedly had been detained before his death. <BR> <B>...Ravanbakhsh, 35, was a Muslim convert to Christianity</B>, considered an apostate by Muslims. He converted at age 24 and studied theology at the Garden of Sharon Bible School in Karaj, Iran. He had been a clergyman for about six years, appointed by the late Bishop Haik Hovsepian-Mehr, director of the  Assemblies of God in Iran. Ravanbakhsh served as a pastor in Sari, Gorgan, and Ghaem-Shahr, Iran. He leaves a wife and two small children.  <BR> <B>...Recent reports reveal that persecution of Iranian Muslim converts to Christianity in Iran</B>, as well as other evangelical Christians, is more severe and widespread than previous reports indicated, the Colorado Springs-based ICI said. Christians continue to be arrested, imprisoned, and tortured because of their faith. Some are kept under surveillance with their phones tapped and letters opened, and others have received death threats, ICI said. Some have lost or been denied jobs, housing, or education. <BR> <B>...&quot;When will these atrocities against Christians end,&quot;</B> a spokesman for ICI asked. &quot;Some pastors and Christian leaders in the West have led a conspiracy of silence. Pastors and church leaders in Iran have been pressured into denying the severe persecution to the world. Therefore, some Western countries have ironically found Iran to be a safe country where Iranian Muslim convert refugees can return,&quot; the group said.    </font></p>

Employees are forbidden to discriminate against homosexuals
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The U.S. Postal Service's law enforcement division has issued a code of conduct</B> that forbids its 4,600 inspectors and police officers from discriminating against homosexuals, even during off-duty hours. The new code requires the signature of each employee. <BR> <B>...The code has resulted in private protests from some employees,</B> <I>The Washington Times</I> reported. One employee said he believes homosexuality is a sin and would not sign the code. Another worker said the code could prevent him from opposing a homosexual pastor at his church or speaking out against same-sex unions. <BR> <B>...The anti-discrimination clause states:</B> &quot;Employees acting in an official capacity will not directly or indirectly authorize, permit or participate in discrimination based on age, gender, ethnic origin, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation against anyone, whether or not they are employees. Because we are a law enforcement agency, off-duty conduct that demonstrates an inability to be fair, objective and unbiased in dealings with others will not be tolerated.&quot; The statement does not include the word religion, which is commonly protected in federal non-discrimination policies. Employees in the division investigate crime committed through the mail. <BR> <B>...A postal service spokesman said the policy will only affect actions that break the law</B>, such as refusing to rent to a homosexual in violation of a local law. &quot;Public objections to a homosexual teaching one's child -- that's free speech. We're not violating anybody's free speech.&quot; <BR> <B>...All Cabinet-level departments except the Pentagon</B> now have rules barring  discrimination based on sexual orientation, said Leonard Hirsch, president of Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Employees of the Federal Government. But only the Postal Service policy extends to an employee's off-duty hours, he said. <BR> <B>...The new code will send a message </B>that &quot;people who have deeply held moral beliefs...need not apply for the federal jobs,&quot; Robert Maginnis, an analyst at the Family Research Council, told the <I>Times</I>. &quot;This is reverse discrimination of the worst kind.&quot;    </font></p>

Elderly are the least likely to support assisted suicide,
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The frail and elderly are least likely to support legalization of doctor-assisted suicide</B>, Duke University Medical Center researchers say. In their study, Duke researchers found that 39.9% of the frail and elderly favor such a law compared to 59.3% of their younger relatives. There was no evidence that those who care for the dying are more likely to favor assisted suicide, Duke researcher Harold Koenig said. <BR> <B>...Polls have shown that two-thirds of adults approve of physician-assisted suicide, </B>UPI said.  But the respondents were primarily healthy individuals under 60 --  the group least likely to be affected by such a law -- said Diane Wildman-Hanlon, co-author of the Duke study. <BR> <B>...Most candidates for assisted suicide will be female</B>, according to M. Cathleen Kaveny, who teaches law at the University of Notre Dame. Sixty-five percent of the people Jack Kevorkian has helped commit suicide have been women, who are more likely than men to live longer, end up poor, and suffer depression, Kaveny said in <I>USA Today</I>.     </font></p>

Protestantism, Afro-Latin religions continue to grow in South

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The trend toward religious pluralism in Latin America is continuing. </B>The continent, once almost entirely Roman Catholic, has a &quot;vast Pentecostal movement&quot; as well as a &quot;resurgence of the native religions and the Afro-Latin religious tradition,&quot; according to Walter Altmann, president of the Latin American Council of Churches. <BR> <B>...The historic Protestant churches are not growing as fast</B>, but offer more &quot;theological reflection and ecumenical commitment,&quot; Altmann told Ecumenical News International. The Roman Catholic Church will remain the majority in South America for the foreseeable future, he said. <BR> <B>...Religious plurality contains a potential for conflict</B> in Latin America, Altmann said. Many religious groups use &quot;very strong military terminology for their evangelistic endeavors such as 'crusade' or 'combating idols,' &quot; he said.    </font></p>

Cubans are rediscovering the Bible  </H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>&quot;An explosion&quot; of interest in the Bible is taking place in Cuba</B>, where spiritual hunger is prevalent, according to Jos&eacute; L&oacute;pez of the Bible Commission in Cuba.  The group is the official channel for all Scriptures imported into Cuba.  It provides Protestant and Catholic churches with the Bibles they request. <BR> <B>...&quot;Everyone wants to have a Bible</B>.  We feel happy because we have Bibles to give them,&quot; L&oacute;pez said.  Bibles are distributed to bookstores and local universities, where they are used as textbooks.  Bibles are in every library in the country, the commission said.  In 1992 and 1994, the commission distributed the Bible at the International Book Fair, where it was the best selling book. <BR> <B>...Last year, 156,000 Bibles, 200,000 New Testaments, and 700,000 Gospels</B> were brought into Cuba as donations from the United Bible Societies.  In the 1970s, only 2,000-3,000 Bibles were permitted, a number that rose to 10,000-15,000 a year in the 1980s.  In 1991, the United Bible Societies gained permission to print Scriptures in Cuba, and in 1993 the German Bible Society sent two printing presses, which now print many Scriptures in Cuba, the commission said. <BR> <B>...&quot;It's very interesting that people who do not belong to a church buy the Bible,&quot;</B> L&oacute;pez said.  &quot;This is because of the very low price made possible because Bibles come to Cuba as a donation from the United Bible Societies.&quot;  <BR> <B>...Many Cubans are disappointed in the atheistic communist system</B> and are searching for spiritual answers.  Paul Shattock of the Christian missions group World Teams said recently that the things Cubans have trusted in -- such as education, the Communist Party, and the economy -- have disillusioned them.  &quot;You only have two options now in Cuba, despair or Christ,&quot; he said.    </font></p>

With Alpha course, seekers feel at home, have time to think
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A Bible course for people who don't attend church</B> has provided hundreds of thousands of people an easy way to check out the Christian faith. The course, called Alpha, is deliberately unchurchy. It includes midweek evening meetings for a meal, a teaching on the Christian faith, and discussion. Subjects include Who Is Jesus?, Why Read the Bible?, Healing, and others. The final meeting is a weekend retreat.  <BR> <B>...There is no pressure, and no rush</B>. A new subject is addressed each week for 10 weeks, providing time for a comprehensive presentation of the gospel and consideration of  its merits. People who don't come back are not contacted. <BR> <B>...The atmosphere at the meetings is relaxed</B>. Organizers make the setting as natural as possible so people will feel at home. One organizer said he is careful about every detail: the lighting, food, parking, and the way people are welcomed. <BR> <B>...The Alpha course originated in England 20 years ago</B> when the curate of Holy Trinity Brompton Anglican church gathered a few people in his living room for a light meal, a talk, and discussion.   <BR> <B>...It is popular with many denominations</B>. People have attended Alpha conferences in England, Canada, the United States, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. An estimated 250,000 people will complete the course this year. For information, contact Terri Hibbard at David C. Cook Publishing Company (847) 741-2400.    </font></p>

Small loans provide &quot;seed money&quot; in Third World
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A small loan goes a long way in the Third World,</B> a growing number of Christian humanitarian groups are finding. <BR> <B>...So-called micro-enterprize loans made to the poor</B> are often more effective than gifts, the groups say. The loans -- typically a few hundred dollars or less -- act as &quot;seed money&quot; that allows an impoverished  person to begin or expand a business, such as a small shop. Income from that business not only can lift a family from poverty, but make it self-sufficient. Such loans can help even the most destitute, including unskilled women in Latin America, poor farmers in Africa, and low caste people in India who had sold themselves and their children into slavery so they would not starve. <BR> <B>...In developing nations, as many as 10 people may be depending on one small business</B>, according to Food for the Hungry, a U.S.-based ministry that makes micro-enterprize loans in 14 countries. Other evangelical groups that make such loans include World Relief, which is part of the National Association of  Evangelicals, and World Concern, based in Seattle.  <BR> <B>...The most extensive and oldest such loan program is run by Opportunity International</B>, a Chicago-based Christian group that organizes loans in 27 developing nations. OI works through 50 local groups, which manage the loans, develop Christian leaders, and help the new businesses in various ways. Some $14.8 million in loans were made through OI in 1995, the group said. <BR> <B>...Emphasis is placed on commitment and honoring one's word.</B> The rate of repayment is 94%, according to OI, which also works through Prison Fellowship to give former prisoners in developing nations a second chance. One such loan helped a notorious ex-criminal in Zimbabwe, who now has become a Christian, started a business, and regained his community's trust, Prison Fellowship said.    </font></p>

Hollywood's new TV rating system criticized</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <H3>Hollywood's new TV rating system criticized</H3>  <BR> <B>Television's new age-based rating system gets a thumbs-down, critics say</B>. Parents want to know each show's level of sex, violence, and foul language -- not be given a general, age-based rating by the entertainment industry. The new system was unveiled Thursday by Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America.  <BR> <B>...The new system offers &quot;no help&quot; to parents who want to know &quot;exactly how bad a program is,&quot;</B> according to the Traditional Values Coalition, a Christian group. The Anaheim, Calif., coalition and other organizations have said they want a content-based rating system. <BR> <B>...Under the new system, at least a dozen television shows will be rated unsuitable for children</B> 14 and under. Shows rated TV-14, or unsuitable for those 14, include: <I>Married...with Children, The X-Files, NYPD Blue, Saturday Night Live, Melrose Place, Profiler</I>, some episodes of <I>Homicide</I> and <I>Walker, Texas Ranger, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Conan O'Brien</I>, some <I>David Letterman</I> shows, and many episodes of daytime soap operas such as <I>General Hospital</I> and <I>All My Children</I>. News shows are exempt from the ratings. <BR> <B>...Here is a listing of the new program ratings, </B>which will begin popping up on the top left corner of television screens in January: <BR> <B>TV-Y</B> -- Appropriate for all children. Themes designed for a very young audience. <Br> <B>TV-Y7</B> -- May be more appropriate for children 7 and older who can distinguish between make-believe and reality. <BR> <B>TV-G</B> -- General audience. Little or no violence. <BR> <B>TV-PG</B> -- Parental guidance suggested. May contain material unsuitable for  younger children <BR> <B>TV-14</B> -- May be unsuitable for children under 14.  <BR> <B>TV-M</B> -- For mature audience only. <BR> <B>...Each show's rating is decided by producers, networks, cable channels, and syndicators</B>. The ratings will work with the V-chip, a device installed in televisions to lock out violent shows. V-chips will appear in new television sets in mid-1998, as required by federal law. Parents then will be able to block shows by rating. <BR> <B>...&quot;Where are the parents in all this decision-making?&quot;</B> asked Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Instead of the new system, the ACLU advocates creation of &quot;independent private ratings systems&quot; developed by organizations such as &quot;the PTA, the Christian Coalition, the Boy Scouts, or even <I>TV Guide</I>.&quot; Steinhardt described Hollywood's rating system as &quot;government-coerced&quot; censorship since the Federal Communications Commission has veto power over any proposed plan. &quot;Does America really want Big Brother sitting on the family couch hogging the remote control?&quot; <BR> <B>...Hollywood should &quot;quit hiding behind this phony ratings ploy</B> and pledge to clean up&quot; its act, said Gary Bauer, president of Family Research Council, a Christian policy group. &quot;Be the good citizens that you want parents to believe you are -- stop the trash, don't just rate it,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...Critics say their protests have been ignored, but they aren't beaten yet</B>. Several of the groups will ask the Federal Communications Commission to reject the code.    </font></p>

Farrakhan is a false prophet, black pastor says</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Louis Farrakhan is a false prophet, says a black pastor</B> who has studied the Nation of Islam movement for 25 years<B>.</B>  Jerry Buckner, pastor at Tiburon Christian Fellowship in Tiburon, Calif., said Farrakhan &quot;has redefined the Jesus of the Bible&quot; and succeeded in splitting the black church, Baptist Press said. <BR> <B>...Farrakhan says Jesus of Nazareth was only a type of the real messiah</B>, said Buckner, a leading authority on the Nation of Islam. He referred to a videotape of Farrakhan's 1994 Easter service titled <I>The Crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the Imprisonment of Minister Louis Farrakhan. </I>In that speech, Farrakhan says that 75% of  what the Bible says about Jesus refers to a future man. Farrakhan also says that Jesus of Nazareth and Elijah are the same person and that Farrakhan is Elijah, meaning Jesus, Buckner said. <BR> <B>...On the tape, Farrakhan relates the crucifixion to himself</B>, saying, &quot;I  am hanging on a cross right now. I'm on Calvary right now and the more I suffer, the more our people are raised to consciousness.  You don't have to look for Jesus. I represent him!&quot; Farrakhan says in the speech. &quot;That is blasphemy,&quot; or claiming for oneself the attributes of God, Buckner said. <BR> <B>...The Nation of Islam's day of atonement, called the Million Man March, tried to redefine the biblical meaning</B> of  the word atonement, Buckner said. Farrakhan's concept of atonement is deliverance or salvation from the &quot;white man's hell on earth,&quot; Buckner said. Farrakhan says that once white domination is thwarted, blacks will be delivered from ignorance, illiteracy, poor education, bad health, and other evils, Buckner said. <BR> <B>...The Nation of Islam is fighting white racism with black racism, and many blacks don't realize it, </B>Buckner said. &quot;The black community is so hungry for a black hero, for a black leader after the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that they are willing to follow anyone,&quot; Buckner said. As a result, conflict is occurring among black churches that support Farrakhan and those that don't. &quot;This little cancer in the church is going to spread,&quot; Buckner said.    </font></p>

Winter solstice celebrations growing more popular</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Celebration of the ancient festival of winter solstice is overshadowing Christmas </B>for a growing number of people. The celebration is based on pagan traditions that pre-date the Christmas holiday. <BR> <B>...The solstice is the shortest daylight time of the year.</B> It occurs each Dec. 21 or Dec. 22 when the northern hemisphere is tilted farthest from the sun. This year, the solstice occurs at 9:05 a.m. Eastern Time on Dec. 21. After the winter solstice, the amount of sunlight increases about one minute a day until the spring equinox. <BR> <B>...In the United States, the fastest growing public solstice observance has been Revels, </B>a celebration of traditional dance, carols, processionals, and plays. Revels started in Cambridge, Mass., 25 years ago and has spread to nine other cities. <BR> <B>...A Winter Solstice Celebration has been held for 17 years </B>at St. John the Divine Cathedral in New York City. Every year, musician Paul Winter hosts the celebration for  an audience of 11,000 people. The show has been carried live on National Public Radio for the last seven years. This year's show, on Dec. 12-14, featured 10 Russian folk singers and dancers, 18 African-American percussionists, and the Forces of Nature Dance Theatre Company. The return of the sun was represented by a seven-foot gong played by a musician as it ascended toward the cathedral's 100-foot-high ceiling. Tickets for the event were $28 to $60. <BR> <B>...Other people celebrate quietly at home or at small parties, </B>seeking a contrast to the commercialism and consumerism of the season. Last year, a Miami couple issued an invitation over the Internet to a winter solstice party at their house. &quot;We'll provide the drinks. Bring food, candles, poetry, love, and hope,&quot; it said. In Madison, Wisc., the fire department issued a Winter Solstice Bonfires announcement, reminding residents that no open fires, except cooking fires, are allowed without a permit. A few residents ask for bonfire permits each month to celebrate the full moon, fire chief Ed Ruckreagle told <I>Religion News Today</I>. <BR> <B>...Highlands Camp and Conference Center in North Carolina</B> advertises its winter solstice get-away weekend as &quot;not for pagans only.&quot; If the &quot;hustle and commercialization of the holiday season have gotten you down, try something different,&quot; the center says. The weekend includes workshops led by members of the Covenant of Unitarian-Universalist Pagans. Topics are earth-centered worship, the feminine divine, the spirituality of drumming, Wiccan circles, and designing spells and charms. An &quot;elaborate ritual&quot; is held around a fire-pit. <BR> <B>...Others create their own contemporary ceremonies</B>. In St. Paul, Minn., Women in Wilderness, an outdoor adventure company, holds winter solstice dog sled trips during the day. At night, the women set up a campfire and talk about the changes of the seasons. &quot;We do a traditional Christmas, with the tree and presents and everything,&quot; Julia Hagedorn of Denver told <I>USA Today</I>. &quot;But solstice has become my favorite night of the whole season. It seems to transcend the 20th century, and I feel very tied to the ancient traditions.&quot; <BR>        </font></p>

Religious leaders will monitor violations of  freedom abroad
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The State Department named 20 religious leaders to a new committee advising the Clinton administration</B> on abuses of  religious liberty overseas. The leaders will look for ways religious groups can mediate conflicts, according to John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state and chair of the committee. Shattuck said his experience working with Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim leaders in Bosnia has shown him &quot;how important it is to stand up for religious freedom and tolerance.&quot; <BR> <B>...The committee includes Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Muslim, Jewish, and Baha'i clergy</B>. Also included are scholars who are experts in international conflict resolution, religious diversity, and the Holocaust. Two evangelicals joined the committee: Don Argue, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, and James Henry, pastor of First Baptist in Orlando and former head of the Southern Baptist Convention. <BR> <B>...Evangelicals had been pressing the administration to appoint a special advisor to focus specifically on persecution of Christians</B>. Instead, the State Department formed a committee with a broader mandate: to address human rights abuses against people of all religions. In the past several years, human-rights organizations have documented torture and killing of Christians, Buddhists, Bahai's, and Muslims. <BR> <B>...Critics said they were concerned the committee would gridlock</B> because its members have fundamental differences over the basic facts. &quot;If it turns out to be a sham, then we'll take appropriate action,&quot; Richard Cizik of the National Association of Evangelicals told <I>The Washington Post</I>. But until then, &quot;let's assume it's being done in good faith.&quot; Announcement of the committee was delayed until after the election because the White House wanted to avoid the perception it was trying to win favor in the religious community, <I>The Post</I> said. <BR> <B>...President Clinton should take the lead against religious persecution, </B>Cizik told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Clinton should &quot;use his bully pulpit&quot; to speak out personally, something he hasn't yet done, Cizik said. The NAE also will push for &quot;more straightforward&quot; discussion of religious rights violations in the State Department's annual human rights report and promote legislation ensuring better treatment for those seeking asylum in the United States, he said. <BR> <B>...Shattuck is expected to accompany Secretary of State Warren Christopher on a four-day visit to China</B> this weekend. He said Beijing's repression of Tibetan culture and religion is an example of an abusive international situation the advisory panel plans to investigate. Christopher plans to raise human rights concerns with Chinese leaders during his trip, U.S. officials said. <BR> <B>...In addition to Argue and Henry, the advisory committee on religious freedom abroad</B> includes: Joan Brown Campbell, National Council of Churches of Christ; Diana L. Eck, Harvard University; Wilma M. Ellis, Baha'is of the Americas; Irving Greenberg, National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership; Frederick Calhoun James, African Methodist Episcopal Church; Leonid Kishkovsky, Orthodox Church of America; Samuel Billy Kyles, Memorial Baptist Church, Memphis, Tenn.; Deborah E. Lipstadt, Emory University; David Little, U.S. Institute of Peace; Laila Al-Marayati, Muslim Women's League; Theodore E. McCarrick, Archbishop of Newark; Wallace Deen Mohammed, Society of Muslim Americans; Russel Marion Nelson, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Ricardo Ramirez, Bishop of Las Cruces, N.M.; Barnett Richard Rubin, Council on Foreign Relations; Nina Shea, Puebla Project of Freedom House; Elliot Sperling, Indiana University; and Archbishop Spyridon of America, Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.    </font></p>

An advocate for homeless children wins award</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>An organization that fights for Latin American street children</B> will be given an award for its efforts.  <A HREF=http://www.casa-alianza.org/>Covenant House Latin America </A>and its director, British-born Anglican layman Bruce Harris, won the 1996 Olof Palme Award, named after the slain Swedish prime minister.  The prize, to be presented during a ceremony in Stockholm Jan. 30, includes 250,000 Swedish krona, about $38,500. <BR> <B>...The group, called Casa Alianza in Spanish, provides shelter and care for street children </B>and acts as their advocate.  It has forcefully opposed the torture and murder of street children by Guatemalan police and the detention of Honduran children in cells with adult criminals, where they often are raped. <BR> <B>...Harris' efforts helped bring about the conviction of four Guatemalan National Police officers </B>who kicked a 13-year-old street boy to death.  In 1991, he told Catholic News Service that Guatemalan police routinely beat, mutilate, and kill street children.  It was only the second time in Guatemalan history that public officials were convicted for human rights violations, Covenant House Latin America said. <BR> <B>...Harris was the focus of the BBC-TV documentary</B> <I>They Shoot Children, Don't They?</I> He also prompted a BBC investigation into the trafficking of human organs in Argentina and Russia, which resulted in the documentary <I>The Body Parts Business</I>. <BR> <B>...In their efforts to protect street children, </B>Harris and other staff members have been involved in confrontations with police,<B> </B>been shot at, and threatened.  Harris, who is married and has two young sons, has moved from his base in Guatemala to Costa Rica for security reasons. <BR> <B>...Harris also has led efforts to control production of narcotic solvent-based shoe glues, </B>which are abused by millions of street children in Latin America.  Children become addicted to sniffing the glue to lessen their hunger, cold, and loneliness, Covenant House said.  Harris has tried to persuade manufacturers to modify the glue's composition to make it less appealing to children. <BR> <B>...Three children who received help from Covenant House </B>are accompanying Harris to Sweden for the award.  Antonio Vasquez, 13, of Honduras, began living on the streets when he was eight, and later moved into a Casa Alianza residence, where he became president of a Boy Scout troop for street children.  He has since returned to his family.  Juana Molina, 14, of Mexico, lives in a Casa Alianza group home after suffering abuse.  Luis Molina, 14, of Guatemala, was living in a rubbish dumpster when he entered Casa Alianza.  All three children had been addicted to glue. <BR> <B>...Previous winners of the Olof Palme Award</B> include President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic; the human rights organization Amnesty International; Students for Sarajevo, which tried to restore some normality to the war-torn city; Chinese dissident Wei Jingshen; and groups that tried to build peaceful relationships between Palestinian and Israeli youth. <BR> <B>...Covenant House is based in New York City and run by Roman Catholic nun</B> Mary Rose McGeady.  She took over for Covenant House founder Bruce Ritter, a Franciscan priest who resigned after charges of sex abuse.  In addition to facilities in Latin America and New York, Covenant House facilities are located in Anchorage, Alaska; Los Angeles; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; New Orleans, La.; Atlantic City, N.J.; Houston, Texas; and Toronto, Canada.     </font></p>

An increasing number of banks are being run by Islamic principles
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A global network of banks and investment houses is taking shape</B> based on financial principles laid down in Islamic teaching. <BR> <B>...Islamic banks charge no interest on loans</B> because the Koran regards that as exploitation: making money without doing work. Instead, commercial borrowers pay the bank a share of their future profits; the bank does not know in advance how much the profit will be, if anything. Mortgage borrowers are charged a flat fee payable in monthly installments; mortgage loans have no compound interest or late-payment charges. <BR> <B>...Islamic banks pay no interest on deposits</B>. Depositors can choose an account that guarantees their money but pays no dividends, or a fund in which they share in the banks' profits and its risks from investments. <BR> <B>...Islamic banks pool their deposits to invest in businesses</B> that do not profit from interest payments and are not linked to liquor, gambling, or other enterprises regarded as sinful. Islamic bankers will not lend money to businesses connected to activities that are considered immoral. Almost every Islamic bank has a committee of religious advisers who audit the bank's accounts. <BR> <B>...Banking by Islamic principles has grown into a competitive multi-billion dollar industry</B>. Islamic bankers are believed to operate 100 banks in 40 countries, with total deposits of $70 billion, according to <A HREF=http://www.speednet.com.au/~nida>Nida'ul magazine. </A> Islamic banks, common in the Middle East, have sprung up in London and the Philippines. Citibank and other major international banks have opened Islamic subsidiaries. Some banks in Malaysia have opened separate teller windows to handle Islamic transactions. <BR> <B>...Islamic banking is &quot;a new phenomenon that has taken many observers by surprise,&quot;</B> according to Mohamed Ariff of the University of Malaya. The whole banking system has been islamized in Iran and Pakistan, and 30 Islamic banks are operating in other parts of the globe, he said.    </font></p>

Clergy fighting for workers' rights</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Clergy increasingly are lining up with a newly revived union movement to promote improved wages</B>, benefits, and conditions for low-wage workers. <BR> <B>...They have supported workers through sermons, pastoral letters, protest marches,</B> sit-ins, petitions, meetings with management, and congressional testimony, <I>The New York Times </I>said. Support comes from black ministers, priests, rabbis, liberal Protestants, and some evangelicals. The grass-roots movement is potentially the strongest since the days of  farm worker leader Cesar Chavez, observers say.  <BR> <B>...In recent months, 57 ministers, priests, and rabbis</B> held a news conference and ran a full-page newspaper ad urging a New Jersey dairy to settle a strike. They also criticized its wage offer as too low to support a family. In another instance, 300 clergy sent a letter to the Case Farms poultry plant in Morganton, N.C., urging management to improve working conditions. Those clergy plan to spread their campaign to help all of the nation's 240,000 poultry-processing employees. <BR> <B>...Labor-clergy coalitions have formed in New York City, Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Boston</B>, Detroit, and Chicago, <I>The New York Times </I>reported. This spring, 40 clerics formed the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice, an umbrella group based in Chicago.  <BR> <B>...Religious leaders say they are trying to address a key ethical issue:</B> the growing gap between America's haves and have-nots. Clergy also are concerned that corporate downsizing and stagnant wages are weakening families. In practical terms, churches, synagogues, and mosques &quot;are on the front lines in dealing with crises&quot; such as hunger and poverty when families need help, said Kim Bobo of the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice. Many people don't understand the ramifications of worker-justice issues, she told the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I>.  <BR> <B>...Business leaders are unhappy with the labor-clergy alliance</B>, <I>The Times</I> said. The leaders contend that clergy do not really belong in the disputes, don't understand the complexities of  the issues, and often fail to listen to management's side of the argument. <BR> <B>...Clergy involvement in labor issues has a long tradition</B>. In the 19th century, clergy joined in struggles against 12-hour work days, child labor, and the right to strike. In recent decades, many clergy were preoccupied with the civil right movement and stayed away from unions because of a perceived corruption there and the belief that workers were thriving. <BR>      </font></p>

Evangelical leader addresses National Council of Churches
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR>  Good morning, and greetings to each one present. Thank you for the privilege of being your guest this morning and for the opportunity to share with you my passion in ministry with the National Association of Evangelicals.   <BR> MISSION STATEMENT <BR>  The mission of the National Association of Evangelicals is to extend the kingdom of God through a fellowship of member denominations, churches, organizations, and individuals, demonstrating the unity of  the body of Christ by standing for biblical truth, speaking with a representative voice, and serving the evangelical community through united action, cooperative ministry, and strategic planning. <BR>  The question is often asked, &quot;Please define what it means to be an Evangelical.&quot; The National Association of Evangelicals would answer that question by responding with our seven-point Statement of  Faith. <BR>        <BR> NAE  STATEMENT OF FAITH <BR>  1. We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God.  <BR>  2. We believe that there is one God, eternally existent, in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. <BR>  3. We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. <BR>  4. We believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful people, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential. <BR>  5. We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life. <BR>  6. We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation. <BR>  7. We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. <BR>  The National Association of Evangelicals was founded in 1942 in St. Louis, Missouri. The historic roots of the association actually go back to 1846 and the founding the Evangelical Alliance in Great Britain. Today, the National Association of Evangelicals is comprised of approximately 42,500 congregations nationwide from 48 member denominations and individual congregations from an additional 30 denominations and fellowships, as well as several hundred independent churches. The membership of the association includes over 250 parachurch ministries and educational institutions. <BR>  Through the cooperative ministry of these members, the National Association of Evangelicals directly and indirectly benefits over 27 million people. <BR>  Through NAE's headquarters in Carol Stream, Illinois, and its Office for Governmental Affairs in Washington, D.C., through its subsidiary, World Relief Corporation, and five affiliates: Evangelical Fellowship of Mission Agencies, representing over 20,000 overseas career missionaries; National Religious Broadcasters, representing over 900 evangelical radio and television stations; Christian Stewardship Association; Evangelical Child and Family Agency; National Association of Christian Child and Family Agencies. NAE has a long history of service to its members, the broad church of Jesus Christ, and to those in need around the world. <BR>  Dr. Timothy George of Beason Seminary, writing in his recent paper, The Church in the Gospel: An Evangelical Assessment, has made some interesting observations regarding evangelicalism. Dr. George writes the following: &quot;As an international, transdenominational fellowship of  some one-half  billion believers around the world, evangelicalism is, in its very existence, an amazing ecumenical fact. <BR>  &quot;The evangelical witness emerged not only, and not primarily, as a protest against abuses in the church, but rather as a protest for the truth of the Gospel. <BR>  &quot;Wolfhart Pannenberg has said that evangelicals, along with Roman Catholics and Orthodox believers, constitute one of the three ascendent, most resilient forces within world Christianity as it prepares to enter the third millennium. But who are these evangelicals? <BR>  &quot;Evangelicals are a worldwide fellowship of Bible believing Christians whose faith and life are marked by four major emphases: 1) the authority and sufficiency of Holy Scripture, the only normative rule of faith and practice for all true believers; 2) the uniqueness of redemption through the death of Christ upon the cross, the benefits of which are imputed to believers who are justified by faith alone; 3) the necessity of personal conversion wrought by the Holy Spirit through personal repentance, faith, and issuing in a life of obedience and growth in Christ, and 4) the priority and urgency of evangelism and missions in fulfillment of the Great Commission of Christ Himself. <BR>  &quot;As a distinctive stream within the wider Christian tradition, evangelicalism has been fed by many diverse rivulets and tributaries including Puritanism, Pietism, and most vigorously in the last 100 years, Pentecostalism.&quot; <BR>  Dr. George identifies &quot;three historical complexes which have had a decisively defining importance for contemporary evangelicals, especially in North America. These are the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, the Great Awakening of the 18th century, and the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy in the 20th century. The Protestant Reformation was a tremendous movement of ecclesial and spiritual renewal which has served historically as a benchmark for evangelical theology, devotion and, in some cases, even church governance. The Great Awakening, epitomized in the life and work of John and Charles Wesley, George Whitfield, and Jonathan Edwards, is an important paradigm not only because it combined an emphasis on the new birth with  reform of society, but also because it spawned three vital movements which continue to shape evangelical priorities to this day: the modern missionary crusade, the holiness movement and revivalism. The Fundamentalist-Modernist conflicts forced evangelicals to define themselves theologically and to forge an interdenominational coalition on this basis.&quot; Thus we now have the National Association of Evangelicals, founded in 1942 with the motto, &quot;cooperation without compromise.&quot; <BR>  Today we find a new and positive identity in the statement, &quot;In essentials, unity; in distinctives, liberty; in all things, charity.&quot;  <BR>  Today, eight core values are the foundation for the various ministries of the National Association of Evangelicals.  These core values are as follows: <BR>  1. Growing Biblical Faith. We believe in a biblical faith demonstrated by loyalty to the Word of God and commitment to proclaiming its message worldwide. <BR>  2. Fostering Cooperation. NAE promotes fellowship, cooperation, networking and dialogue as a means of evangelical witness representing and supporting autonomy of each local church, denomination, organization and institution. <BR>  3. Witness to Society. Confronting society with the relevance of the Gospel by being salt and by reflecting Christ's light is one of our missions. <BR>  4. Ministry to the Poor. We minister to the poor and hungry through physical aid and spiritual witness. <BR>  5. Attending to Human Concerns. We stand committed to biblically defined human values, the sanctity of human life, and human rights. <BR>  6. Cross Cultural Involvement. NAE celebrates the ethnic diversity in the world and will work to bring healing and involvement of the races in our ministry. <BR>  7. Maximizing Resources. NAE seeks the maximization and stewardship of all resources God has given to us. <BR>  8. Nurturing Communications. We will use media to engage our culture at every level with the absolute truth claims of the Gospel. <BR>  Our strategic plan for the dawn of the twenty-first century entitled An Evangelical Manifesto has been released and is available for you today. This document is directed toward revival and renewal in this nation and is based on the Great Commandment of John 13 &amp; 17 as an integral part of the Great Commission of Mark 16 and Matthew 28. Our manifesto provides the guide for operation of NAE's varied ministries and specifically calls for action in five areas: <BR>  1.  A call for prayer which is a prelude to effective ministry. <BR>  2.  A call for repentance and reform. <BR>  3.  A call for unity and cooperation. <BR>  4.  A call for evangelism. <BR>  5.  A call for cultural impact. <BR>  Currently, two major projects dealing with racial reconciliation and concern for persecuted Christians around the world are the focus of much attention. <BR>  In cooperation with the National Black Evangelical Association and with the assistance of Zondervan Publishing, a national effort has been launched and materials supplied to assist local churches in dealing with racial reconciliation. Copies of the materials that have been prepared can be supplied by contacting my office. <BR>  According to some of the nation's leading journalists, the persecution of Christians around the world may be the greatest human rights violation of this decade. In cooperation with the North American office of the World Evangelical Fellowship, 70,000 packets dealing with the problem of religious persecution were distributed to churches across the country. A twenty-minute video presentation was prepared that calls America's church leaders to petition the government to do something about these atrocities involving violations of conscience and also presented actual cases of severe religious persecution. Ten thousand copies of the video were distributed to churches and agencies across the nation. <BR>  Perhaps the world's best known evangelical, Billy Graham, stated in the epilogue of our evangelical manifesto the following, &quot;The world in our time is said to have made discipleship harder. But it has also made evangelism easier. Today's world is said to be multiplying crisis all around us. But we must never forget that, for the Gospel, each crisis is an opportunity. So it is important that we speak and act in  hope. The night has not yet fallen. The culture is far from closed. In our modern world, more people are more open at more moments in their lives than perhaps at any time in history. <BR>  &quot;Evangelicalism has a future to the extent that we evangelicals ourselves are drawn by the Gospel, are defined by the Gospel, and are declaring and demonstrating the Gospel of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in word and deed.&quot; <BR>  Please feel free to visit us at our headquarters in Carol Stream or at our website: <A HREF=http://www.nae.net>http://www.nae.net.</A> We'll look forward to hearing from you. <BR> <I>Note: The National Association of Evangelicals is located at 450 Gundersen Drive, Carol Stream, Ill., 60188.

Medical rationing: Who lives and who dies?</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Rationing of organ transplants is becoming a reality in the United States</B>. A group that controls the allocation of liver transplants decided this week that dying patients with the best chance for survival will get top priority. Those who are just as ill but have less of a chance for survival will have lower priority. In the past, the sickest people were at the top of the list to receive new livers, regardless of their chance for survival.  <BR> <B>...People who have a sudden liver failure will be moved to the top of the list </B>because they usually do better after a transplant than those who have been ill for a long time. Others given top priority because of a higher success rate are those who just had a liver transplant that failed within seven days and children who would suffer damage to their nervous systems if they did not immediately get a transplant. <BR> <B>...The liver decision is a test case for medical rationing in general</B>, bioethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan of the University of Pennsylvania told <I>The New York Times</I>. &quot;All of us will have to confront the decision of what is fair in the allocation of scarce resources,&quot; he said. Last year, 7,279 people put their names on waiting lists for a liver, but only 3,922 liver transplants were performed. The decision to change priorities was made this week by the United Network for Organ Sharing, a private group of transplant experts overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.     </font></p>

Supreme Court hears assisted-suicide case on Wednesday</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether mentally competent</B>, terminally sick patients have a right to get help from doctors to commit suicide. The dispute raises legal, moral, and ethical questions that have caused heated emotional debate. A ruling is expected by July. <BR> <B>...At issue are laws from New York and Washington state that ban doctor-assisted suicide.</B> More than 30 states have made assisted suicide a crime. Only Oregon allows it. A U.S. appeals court in California last year created a right to physician-assisted suicide, citing the same protections used as the basis for the abortion ruling. <BR> <B>...A dying person's pain and torment &quot;is too intimate and personal for the state</B> to insist that (the patient) bear it,&quot; said Harvard University law professor Laurence Tribe, who will argue before the court in favor of assisted suicide. End-of-life decisions should be left to the individual, Tribe said in his brief. Joining Tribe in arguing for assisted suicide will be Kathryn Tucker, a lawyer for the Washington-based group Compassion in Dying. <BR> <B>...States have a legitimate interest in &quot;protecting vulnerable patients from mistake and abuse,&quot;</B> said New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco, who will defend the bans on assisted suicide. Clinton administration attorney Walter Dellinger and an attorney for the state of Washington will argue against a right to assisted suicide. <BR> <B>...Vulnerable people &quot;deserve more from a culture which desires to consider itself civilized </B>and human than assistance or encouragement in the annihilation of all of their rights by self-destruction,&quot; the National Right to Life Committee said. The American Geriatric Society said dying people are often &quot;very weak, prone to strong emotions, and vulnerable to the suggestions, expectations and guidance of others.&quot; <B>...The ban on assisted suicide &quot;helps ensure that patients will never lose the trust</B> that must exist for the relationship between health-care professionals and patients to flourish,&quot; the American Medical Association said. <BR> <B>...Courts can't stop people from committing suicide,</B> said 15 surviving family members who filed briefs in the case. The issue is how the deaths will occur, they said. Will the deaths be &quot;acts of violence taken alone&quot; or situations involving &quot;medically trained personnel evaluating and assisting, in the open, according to legal guidelines.&quot; The risk of abuse or mistake can be &quot;appropriately dealt with through regulation,&quot; the American Civil Liberties Union said. <BR> <B>...The arguments do not involve retired pathologist Jack Kevorkian,</B> who has acknowledged attending more than 45 deaths since 1990. Kevorkian described the Supreme Court as &quot;nine religious kooks&quot; and said he will not be present when the court takes up the issue, <I>The Oakland Press</I> reported. &quot;Any law that prohibits this should be disobeyed, and the public knows this,&quot; Kevorkian said. <BR> <B>...Thousands of people with severe disabilities will gather outside the court</B> <B>in Washington, D.C.,</B> to protest physician-assisted suicide. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, an evangelical Christian who opposes physician-assisted suicide, will address the demonstrators. &quot;Society must not allow doctors to be killers as well as healers,&quot; Koop told <I>USA Today</I>. <BR> <B>...Religious beliefs prevent many older Americans from committing suicide, </B>a new poll found. In a survey of 30,000 older Americans, two out of three support legalizing physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill and slightly more than half think doctors should be allowed to give people instructions on how to end their lives. But the survey, taken by the marketing firm RxRemedy Inc., also found that about half  of those surveyed say their religious beliefs prevent them from considering suicide or helping a terminally ill friend commit suicide. <BR> <B>...In the general population, 72% believe assisted suicide should be legalized </B>and doctors should be allowed to assist suicides. But only 33% say that any person should be allowed to commit suicide, according to a poll conducted by MSNBC, a cable television and Internet news provider. <BR> <B>...In Australia, Janet Mills, a 52-year-old housewife suffering from a rare form of cancer</B> became the second person to end her life under a Northern Territory law that sanctions doctor-assisted suicide. Mills suffered from mycosis fungoides, which had eaten away her skin causing disfigurement, bleeding, and constant itching. &quot;Peace at last,&quot; were Mills' last words to her husband and son after she activated computerized equipment that pumped lethal drugs into her blood, The Associated Press reported. <BR> <B>...&quot;I believe that euthanasia is the greatest thing for people who are sick with no chance of getting better,&quot;</B> Mills said in a written statement before her death. &quot;It's a wonderful idea and it stops people from suffering when they don't need to.&quot; <BR> <B>...Mills' physician, Philip Nitschke, said he helped her switch on the equipment </B>that delivered the lethal dose Jan. 2. Nitschke also helped cancer patient Bob Dent become the first person to commit legal euthanasia on Sept. 22. Nitschke said he hopes anyone else wishing to use the law &quot;does not have to go through such a long battle to find a doctor to help them. The whole thing was very hard on me and my family.&quot;  <BR> <B>...The announcement of Mills' death prompted churches, the Australian Medical Association</B>, and some legislators to step up their opposition to the law. Australia's federal Parliament is considering a bill to overturn the territory's law.    </font></p>

Christians are praying for Muslims during Ramadan</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>An estimated 10 million Christians around the world will pray for Muslims </B>during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which starts today.  Christians are asking God to reveal Himself more fully to the world's one billion Islamic believers, who will spend the month in a dawn-to-dusk fast and spiritual inventory.  During Ramadan, Muslims are forbidden to indulge in all sensual pleasures, including sex and listening to music.  Government offices and some private companies observe shorter working hours.  <BR> <B>...&quot;We're not praying to Allah,&quot; </B>said Randy Sprinkle, a Southern Baptist prayer coordinator.  &quot;We're joining Muslims during that period as they seek God.&quot;  <BR> <B>...This is a strategic time to pray for Muslims, Christian leaders say.  </B>Muslims have reportedly been experiencing dreams, visions, and angelic visitations; missionaries are increasingly being asked to interpret these signs.  Last year, thousands of North African Muslims wrote to a Christian radio service asking for information; many reported a similar dream in which Jesus appeared and told them, &quot;I am the way.&quot; <BR> <B>...People praying for Muslims must put aside stereotypes of terrorists or extremists, </B>said Erich Bridges of the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board.  Muslims are &quot;overwhelmingly non-extremists, normal, family people who are trying to live their lives like we are,&quot; he told Mission News Network.  The majority Sunni sect of Islam dominates most Muslim countries.  The largest Shi'ite Muslim country is Iran. <BR> <B>...Many of those praying during Ramadan will follow a printed daily guide</B> that focuses on a different  people group each day.  Half a million copies of the guide have been published in 30 languages, including Swahili and Chinese, according to organizers of  the 30 Days Muslim Prayer Focus, an interdenominational ministry begun in 1993 by Youth With A Mission.  The 30 Days effort has been endorsed by many Christian groups, such as Campus Crusade for Christ, Operation Mobilization, and the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement.  Prayer guides also are available for children. <BR> <B>...Factors tending to increase Muslim openness to Christianity</B> include secularization of the Middle East, negative reaction among Muslims to Islamic radicals, work by Christian relief ministries to Muslims, and Muslim migration to more open areas, evangelical scholar Dudley Woodberry told Baptist Press.<B>  </B> <BR> <B>...Ramadan celebrates God's delivery of the Koran, Islam's holy book</B>, to the prophet Mohammed nearly 1,400 years ago.  The Muslim world covers a broad arc that begins in northwest Africa, continues through Turkey, Iran, and the Indian subcontinent, and reaches as far as Indonesia, the most populous Islamic country.  Many Muslims also live elsewhere in the world, including Europe, North America, and Australia.  Muslims formally break the fast with Eid al-Fitr, which involves a religious feast and an exchange of gifts.     </font></p>

Unitarians show a growing interest in spirituality</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Interest in spirituality is increasing among Unitarians</B>, who long have placed their faith in reason and social action rather than God. <BR> <B>...The rising popularity of spiritual experience among Unitarians </B>has taken the form of rituals, prayer, meditation, candle-lighting, and music drawn from Western, Eastern, American Indian, and other sources.  At First Unitarian Church in Cambridge, Mass., last year, 30 people out of a congregation of 150 responded to a clergyman's invitation to participate in a healing service for the physically or emotionally afflicted, <I>The New York Times</I> reported.  <BR> <B>...Some Unitarian clergy see the new hunger for spirituality as a rounding-out</B> of their religious identity, blending the mind with the heart and soul.  Others say that, just as the previous generation of Unitarians fled Protestantism, Catholicism, and Judaism, the current generation is escaping the spiritual emptiness of modern culture. <BR> <B>...A growing pagan movement also exists in Unitarianism.  </B>The <A HREF= http://www.notelrac.com/notelrac/whuups.dir >Unitarian Universalist Pagans</A>, known as CUUPS, promotes the &quot;practice of contemporary pagan and Earth-centered and nature-centered spirituality.&quot; The group helps Unitarians, pagans, Wiccans, and followers of other alternative religions to communicate with each other and develop neo-pagan services. <BR> <B>...Unitarians range from the liberal edge of Christianity to agnostics, atheists</B>, and practitioners of Zen Buddhism and New Age rituals.  They are encouraged to tolerate the ideas of others so everyone can present their opinions openly.  Unitarianism is a creedless faith, meaning it does not require adherents to accept Christianity or any other religion.  Unitarians number about 210,000. <BR> <B>...<A HREF=http://uua.org>Unitarian Universalism </A> grew out of Unitarian Christianity</B>, which denied the Trinity and the Divinity of Christ, and out of Universalist Christianity, which held that no one was damned to eternal punishment.  Although Unitarianism finds value in various religious traditions, it is not compatible with fundamentalism, which recognizes scripture as the inerrant word of God, Unitarians say.     </font></p>

Missionaries in Russia have a new sense of urgency</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The harvest of souls continues in the former Soviet Union. </B> Approximately 4,000 new evangelical fellowships have started in the past five years in the Commonwealth of Independent States, according to Peter Deyneka Russian Ministries. <BR> <B>...Russian Christians say church-planting is the most effective way to evangelize the CIS</B>. Several church-planting initiatives have begun. One initiative is Project 250, a cooperative effort among Russian Ministries, TEAM, CBInternational, Harvester Ministries, InterAct, individual Southern Baptist missionaries, and Russian Christian leaders. Project 250 has trained 1,000 Christians in methods of church-planting. The trained nationals are starting churches that reach all segments of society,  including alcoholics, former adherents of pagan and Eastern religions, drug addicts, prisoners, the physically handicapped, and people in isolated Arctic and Siberian regions. <BR> <B>...Other church planters are working in Moslem areas</B>, the isolated islands of Kamchatka, and the war-torn areas of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Others are planting churches in cities. Some missionary-evangelists have left their homes to start churches in less familiar, more remote areas, such as the Arctic and the borders of China, where there are few evangelical churches, Deyneka said. The long-term goal of national Christians is to establish an evangelical church in every CIS community. <BR> <B>...Other evangelists are planting churches among the estimated 610,000 people</B> who made professions of faith in Christ during a series of evangelistic television programs aired by the Christian Broadcasting Network during the last five years. Many of  those believers still have no church. The church-planting effort is a cooperative venture among CBN, Wheaton, Ill.-based Russian Ministries, and Garden Grove, Calif.-based Assist Ministries.<B> </B>Almost all of the new believers were teenagers when they watched the program.<B> </B> The show,<B> </B><I>What Are you Living For?</I> was cohosted by Barry Taylor, a former equipment manager for the heavy metal band AC/DC. Taylor now is a Los Angeles pastor. <BR> <B>...Increasing political instability in Russia</B>, in part caused by Boris Yeltsin's fragile health, has created a new sense of urgency to train Russian nationals to take over for Westerners, missionaries say. The country's social fabric also is fraying. About two million Russians  take illegal drugs and 15% of the country's 150 million people have had contact with narcotics, government officials say. Police are short of funds to prevent the spread of drugs, which leads to more crime and AIDS, Reuters news service said. &quot;To say the least, we just don't know what's going to happen,&quot; Assist's Dan Wooding  told Religion News Today. &quot;The quicker we can equip them the better.&quot; <BR> <B>...Among those emphasizing the equipping of nationals is the CoMission. </B>The group -- a partnership of  dozens of Western Christian schools, foundations, relief agencies, parachurch groups, missions agencies, churches, and denominations -- has taught biblical principles in CIS schools. But after 1997, the CoMission will emphasize preparation of  nationals to lead churches and cell groups. CoMission II will begin Jan. 1, 1998, after the expiration of the group's self-imposed four-year term has expired. Many CoMission I agencies will continue to work together under the new partnership, according to King Crow, CoMission executive director. <BR> <B>...Many more nationals must be trained as theological teachers, </B>according to nearly 100 national and Western church leaders who met in Kiev Sept. 9-13 to plan evangelistic strategies. The leaders said they will develop a plan to train the leaders and form the Eurasian Theological Accrediting Association to assure quality at theological schools.    </font></p>

Singing the song of the redeemed</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A unique gospel music group has many reasons for praising God in their concerts</B>.  All four members of the group Beyond Belief have fought drug addiction, a life of crime, estrangement from their families, and despair.  They all are graduates or former clients of the <A HREF=http://www.bowery.org>Bowery Mission</A>, a Christian group that helps the poor, homeless, and drug-addicted in lower Manhattan, New York City. <BR> <B>...The themes of salvation and redemption come through loud and clear</B> during each of the group's  30 concerts a year, held in churches and prisons throughout the eastern United States.  During the concerts, each man tells the story of how Jesus Christ saved him. <BR> <B>...God took defeated men and gave them new lives</B>, said James Macklin, who founded the group four years ago.  Macklin, a former blues singer, lost everything to drugs.  One day, he was asleep on a bag of tin cans at 2:30 a.m. when &quot;a little old lady came by and woke me,&quot; he told the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I>.   &quot;She asked, 'What's a man like you doing in a condition such as this?' The same man that raised Lazarus, she told me, can raise you.&quot;        <BR> <B>...Group member Al White spent 29 years on the street using heroin and cocaine</B>.  One day, he ran into a group of Christians in a park, and asked them to pray for him.  White was delivered from drugs on the spot, he said.  Eugene Chisholm had 12 convictions during his years of heroin abuse.  His salvation came when a friend hounded Chisholm to do something about his life, even tracking him down when he lived under a bridge.  Bob Mack, the youngest group member, had a career in the music business in Los Angeles before a cocaine habit led him to steal from his family to finance his addiction. <BR> <B>...&quot;I am a man who has known hurt, pain, and despair </B>-- and what it is to rise above that,&quot; Macklin, 58, told <I>Religion News Today</I>.  Macklin, who is black and grew up in the South, today sings at many white churches.  The gospel message transcends race, he said.  &quot;I'm not a fanatic.  This is real,&quot; he said.    <BR> <B>...Last summer, doctors told Macklin he has HIV,</B> the virus that causes AIDS.  He contracted the disease from intravenous drug use more than a decade ago. Macklin feels good, and speaks excitedly about his future of praising God through music.  &quot;I'm one of the happiest people in the world.&quot;     </font></p>

Presbyterian Church allows minister who had sex change</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A woman who was ordained as a man in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) before undergoing a sex change</B> has been allowed to retain her ordination. The Presbytery of Greater Atlanta voted in favor of Erin Swenson, a 48-year old father of two adult daughters, formerly known as Eric Swenson. <BR> <B>...Swenson, who was ordained in 1973, has been a private marriage therapist for 12 years</B>. Previous jobs held by Swenson include a position as instructor at the Candler School of Theology, a United Methodist seminary at Emory University in Atlanta, Ecumenical News International reported. <BR> <B>...It is believed to be the world's first case of a mainstream church body giving official recognition</B> to a transsexual, Reuters news service said. Anne Sayre, the presbytery associate for justice and women, told ENI that the presbytery decided it had no theological or moral ground to revoke the ordination. <BR> <B>...Swenson's former wife and father-in-law support the request for continued ordination status</B>. &quot;A wounded healer can be the best kind of minister,&quot; O.H. Lyon said.  <BR> <B>...&quot;This individual is a male,&quot; </B>said Wade, a minister who voted against Swenson's request. Wade insisted that Swenson's &quot;gender identify confusion&quot; can be &quot;healed by the power of the Spirit of God,&quot; ENI said. <BR> <B>..&quot;There was no serious discussion of theological issues,&quot; </B>said Wade, acknowledging that the denomination's Book of Order does not address the subject. A lot of people in the presbytery are upset about the outcome, he said.    </font></p>

Evangelical leader addresses convention of National Council

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>For the first time, a president of the National Association of Evangelicals has formally addressed the general assembly of the National Council of Churches</B>. NAE President Don Argue spoke to the group this morning in Chicago, explaining the NAE's values and mission. The NAE represents many of the nation's theologically and politically conservative groups, while the NCC's 33 Protestant and Orthodox member organizations are more ecumenical and comparatively more liberal. <BR> <B>...The speech was &quot;an open invitation from them to get to know us,&quot;</B> the NAE's David Melvin told <I>Religion News Today</I>. The two organizations have no plans to form any &quot;structural unity,&quot; he said, but the NAE will cooperate with any group on significant issues &quot;as long as we can maintain our evangelical integrity.&quot; The NAE is &quot;moving cautiously&quot; so it will not endanger relationships it already has built among evangelicals, he said. <BR> <B>...NAE leaders considered the &quot;political land mines&quot; inherent in Argue's appearance</B> before the NCC, Melvin said. The speech gave Argue the opportunity to explain evangelicalism and &quot;bring the gospel to bear on broader communities.&quot; <BR> <B>...On Friday, Imam Wallace Deen Mohammed, leader of Al-Islam</B>, the largest orthodox African American Muslim movement, was to address an interfaith prayer breakfast at the NCC's general assembly.     </font></p>

Church arsons are decreasing in number</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Arson attacks on churches have declined sharply over the past six months</B>.  The federal National Church Arson Task Force said five black churches and six other churches were burned or bombed in December.  That's a decrease in the monthly number from the peak of 19 black and 30 others last June, Ecumenical News Service reported. <BR> <B>...The task force said 328 incidents had been investigated</B> <B>from Jan. 1, 1995, to Jan. 7, 1997</B>.  There were 143 arrests involving 116 whites, 24 blacks, and one Hispanic.  Forty-eight people have been convicted.  A racial breakdown for those convicted was not given because some were juveniles.  Of those arrested, more than 40% were 17 or younger. <BR> <B>...In October, investigators found &quot;no evidence of a national or even a regional conspiracy</B> to set the fires,&quot; according to Mary Frances Berry, a black woman who chairs the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.  The investigations revealed a range of motives, &quot;from blatant racism and religious hatred to financial profit, to personal revenge or vandalism.&quot; <BR> <B>...A National Council of Churches fund made grants of $1.6 million to 38 churches in December</B>.  That brought its total donations to nearly $4.6 million for 79 churches.  About $600,000 remains in the fund.  A NCC report Jan. 10 stated that &quot;124 churches in 22 states have been documented as victims of racially-motivated arson.&quot;    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Kabul, Afghanistan, which enjoyed one of the most liberal lifestyles of any Islamic city</B> in Central Asia, suddenly has come under medieval Islamic rule. <BR> <B>...Late last month, the city of 1 million fell to Taliban militias</B>, which imposed <I>sharia</I>, the harsh Islamic criminal code. <I>Sharia</I> prescribes stoning to death for adulterers and drug dealers, amputations of hands and feet for thieves, and flogging for those who sell or drink liquor. <I>The New York Times</I> reported that one man has been paraded through the Afghan capital, a weight attached to his lower jaw to keep his mouth open, and his left hand severed. <BR> <B>...A secretive ruling council of Islamic clerics quickly reshaped everyday life in Kabul</B>. Movie theaters have been closed, the television station shut down, and the playing of all music banned, the <I>Times </I>reported. All men in government jobs have been ordered to grow untrimmed beards, and Western-style suits have been banned. Girls' schools have been closed, women with jobs have been ordered to stay home, and, when venturing out, to wear a full gown. <BR> <B>...Kabul's capture has brought some peace to the city,</B> weary from a 22-month siege in the country's civil war. Residents now are able to move around without fear of long-range artillery, which had killed 30,000 people and left much of the city in rubble. Kabul residents also are talking about an end to the long civil war across Afghanistan. Some have long said they would sacrifice almost anything to achieve peace, the <I>Times</I> reported.    </font></p>

Graham comes home to massive crowds in Charlotte</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Billy Graham preached to 304,500 people in his hometown of Charlotte, N.C.,</B> Sept. 26-29. The four-day crusade -- filled with emotion and nostalgia as well as a warning about the end of the world -- was very likely the last Graham will preach in the city where he was born and raised. <BR> <B>...Charlotte pulled out all the stops for its returning native son</B>. The crusade, two years in the planning, was held at the new Ericsson Stadium and reportedly cost $2.8 million. It featured guests such as former NFL football coach Joe Gibbs, Johnny Cash, the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, the Charlie Daniels Band, Joni Erickson Tada, the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra, and a 7,000-voice choir. It was the fifteenth crusade Graham has conducted in the Carolinas. <BR> <B>...Graham, seeking to leave his mark on the next generation, also emphasized youth.</B> Saturday night's high-volume rock concert featured Christian contemporary music groups dc Talk and Michael W. Smith as well as a short sermon by Graham. The evening drew 88,000 rain-soaked teens to the stadium, including 13,000 who watched from a large screen outside. As Graham gave his familiar invitation to follow Christ, thousands of teens left their places and covered the infield. A Saturday-morning crusade event also drew 30,000 children for a service that included cartoon characters and Bible lessons. <BR> <B>...On the last night of  the crusade, Graham warned his audience.</B>  He compared modern society's lust for pleasure to the biblical city of Sodom, saying people have perverted the &quot;marvelous gift&quot; of sex. &quot;Armageddon is going to come. There's going to be a great disturbance in the whole world,&quot; he told the stadium crowd, a mixture of young and old, evangelical and Roman Catholic. Graham said the greatest surprise of his life has been life's brevity. He told the audience they will have to take a stand, one way or the other, regarding Jesus Christ. <BR> <B>...Graham is not quitting crusades yet</B>, even though some thought the Charlotte homecoming would have made a fitting career finale. Graham, who is increasingly frail and suffers from Parkinson's Disease, has booked crusades next year in Texas and California, and may go to South Africa and Brazil. His son Franklin, also an evangelist, will fill in if his father is too sick to preach. <BR> <B>...&quot;I pray for strength every day,&quot;</B> Graham told reporters at his home in Montreat, N.C., recently. God eventually will &quot;retire me by illness or some other reason. But I have no plans because God called me to preach and I intend to preach as long as I have strength to do so.&quot; <BR> <B>...Graham has written an autobiography.</B> <I>Just As I Am, </I>which will detail the evangelist's life in and out of the public eye, will be out next year, said HarperCollins Publishers/Zondervan Publishing House.    </font></p>

The church has a golden opportunity to meet people's needs,
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Religious leaders agree with each other on the state of the church and the nation</B>, pollster George Gallup found. Gallup's Princeton Religion Research Center conducted confidential interviews with 25 well known church leaders, seminary presidents, writers, and commentators. <BR> <B>...American culture is steadily deteriorating</B>, the leaders said. Society is fragmenting as people pursue self-interest, which often involves materialism and consumerism. Computers continue to drive Americans into isolation and loneliness, the leaders said. Evidences of societal decay are numerous. They include the flight of the father, deterioration of families, an increasing number of children born out of wedlock, trouble in public schools, and poverty. Some 39 million people -- including 22% of all children -- live in poverty. <BR> <B>...Increasingly, community life is shunned</B>. Thus, society is in danger of splintering into many special interest groups, each pursuing its own cause and distrusting others, the leaders said.  <BR> <B>...An intellectual mood called post-modernism also is growing</B>. This includes a loss of respect for truth. The objective moral order is considered to be merely a product of one's opinions or personal preferences.  <BR> <B>...The spiritual bankruptcy of the era has caused a spiritual hunger, </B>and leaders wonder in what ways it will be satisfied. Post-modern thought says all forms of spirituality -- including Christianity -- are equally valid. This outlook is resulting in a fragmentation of the Western religious heritage, the leaders said.  <BR> <B>...At this time of societal crisis, traditional religion has a great opportunity</B> to influence spiritual seekers. But the church may not be up to the task, the leaders observed. Deepening of faith requires intellectual discipline and moral self-sacrifice, and most churches today encourage neither, they said. Success will depend on orthodox preaching and teaching, small-group development, and powerful worship experiences, the leaders said.    <BR>           </font></p>

</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>More than 2,000 Christian leaders and laypeople will gather in St. Louis Nov. 14-16 to pray for revival</B> in the United States and the world. Hundreds more will meet at 102 satellite locations -- most of them in churches -- where they will follow along with the event, broadcast live from the America's Center. <BR> <B>...&quot;The United States is one of the most sinful nations in the world,&quot; </B>said <A HREF=http://www.ccci.org/>Campus Crusade for Christ</A> founder Bill Bright, who is leading the event for the third consecutive year. Fasting &amp; Prayer '96 is being organized by Mission America, an interdenominational coalition of organizations, individuals, and churches. Previous Fasting &amp; Prayer events have taken place in Orlando, Fla., and Los Angeles. <BR> <B>...After winning the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion in March,</B> Bright said he would use the $1.1 million award to promote fasting and prayer worldwide. This is the first time the event has been broadcast live to remote satellite locations. <BR> <B>...&quot;As Christians we have been unfaithful to God and our responsibilities,&quot;</B> Bright said. But he says the situation is not hopeless. &quot;We are confident that God wants to spare our nation. We believe He is going to send a great spiritual awakening to North America and the world before the end of the year 2000.&quot; <BR> <B>...Sessions during the three-day event </B>will consist of various speakers followed by prayer focused on topics such as churches, families, government leaders, evangelism, and youth. <BR> <B>...Organizers of the St. Louis event include:</B> Don Argue, president of the <A HREF=http://www.nae.net/>National Association of Evangelicals</A>; author Kay Arthur; Charles Blake of  the West Angeles Church of God in Christ; Bright's wife, Vonette; David Bryant of <A HREF=http://www.pfi.org./>Concerts of Prayer</A> International; Paul Cedar of Mission America; Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse; Larry Lewis of  the Home Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention; <A HREF=http://www.promisekeepers.org/>Promise Keepers</A> founder Bill McCartney; <A HREF=http://www.apu.edu/>Azusa Pacific University</A> dean Jesse Miranda; broadcaster Pat Robertson; Baptist pastor Adrian Rogers; <A HREF=http://www.apu.edu/>Moody Bible Institute</A> President Joseph Stowell; and Assemblies of God leader Thomas Trask. <BR> <B>...More than 140 Christian leaders have lent their support and encouragement to the event. </B>They include Ted Baehr of the Christian Film and Television Commission; pollster George Barna; Henry Blackaby, author of the <I>Experiencing God</I> Bible study; pastor Wellington Boone; Charles Colson of <A HREF=http://www.pfi.org./>Prison Fellowship</A>; Paul Crouch of <A HREF=http://www.tbn.org/>Trinity Broadcasting Network</A>; Youth With A Mission founder Loren Cunningham; James and Shirley Dobson of Focus on the Family; Ted Engstrom of World Vision; Eddie Fox of the World Methodist Council; Brandt Gustafson of the National Religious Broadcasters; Jack Hayford of the Church on the Way; educator and author Howard Hendricks; pastor E.V.

Religion in the NFL </H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Many National Football League players are expressing their religious beliefs more openly.  </B>The sight of players praising God in an interview after a victory, kneeling for an end-zone prayer, or leading the Lord's Prayer in the locker room has become more common in recent years. <BR> <B>...A few years ago, some NFL players began assembling at midfield prayer huddles </B>after games.  Every NFL team has a chaplain, and Bible study and chapel services are available for players.  Although Christianity is the most commonly expressed religion among the players, Jews and Muslims aren't discouraged from expression. <B> </B> <BR> <B>...Being a Christian in the NFL used to carry negative connotations, </B>and some players still don't like it.  Last month, Washington Redskins running back Brian Mitchell said too many of his teammates were more concerned with being &quot;goody two-shoes&quot; than playing aggressive football.  &quot;I'm a man of God,&quot; Redskins cornerback Darrell Green replied.  &quot;But I can still lay a lick on you.&quot; <BR> <B>...Many negative connotations of being a Christian football player have eased since the 1970s</B>, when Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy was a player.  Dungy follows the lead of successful former coaches Joe Gibbs and Tom Landry, instilling Christian principles into his program.  He tries to manage his players without yelling or using profanity, and looks for Christians when hiring assistant coaches. <BR> <B>...The spirituality of some players contrasts to the fast-lane lifestyles of others</B>.  Temptations to indulge in drugs and extra-marital sex are everywhere, players say.  Reggie White of the Super Bowl-bound Green Bay Packers, a defensive end in his 12th NFL season, has been credited with helping many players become committed to Christ over the years.  The 6 foot 6 inch, 285 pound White is known to ask opposing linemen in the heat of a football game, &quot;Are you treating the Lord right?&quot;  <BR> <B>...As many as 25 players meet regularly in White's room</B> to talk about issues such as temptation.  &quot;We let them know we're going through the same things.  And they open up to us.  We want them to know that we're real,&quot; he told <I>USA Today</I>.  White, an ordained minister, is co-pastor of the Inner City Church in Knoxville, Tenn.  He also has spoken about his faith in more than 100 churches.  White earned his minister's license at age 17, and was known in high school for his size as well as for the fact that he carried a Bible everywhere he went. <BR> <B>...Some players have found God since entering the NFL</B>.  Philadelphia Eagles'<B> </B>receiver Irving Fryer took the long route to Christianity.  He used cocaine and marijuana, was accused of beating his girlfriend, was arrested for carrying a loaded rifle, and in 1990 was left unconscious after being hit in the head with a baseball bat during a brawl.  Fryer said he listened to God when he was brought to the breaking point.  He now is an associate pastor at Hopewell Baptist Church in Pompano Beach, Fla., as well as a team leader and the Eagles' most valuable player.    </font></p>

Bankrupt Cult Awareness Network sold to Scientologist</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A prominent anti-cult network has been forced into bankruptcy and its assets sold, </B>crippling a nationwide anti-cult movement that kept unorthodox religions on the defensive. The Cult Awareness Network, based in Chicago, was influential for 20 years in shaping the public's image of controversial religious groups. CAN staff members took 350 telephone inquiries a week from distraught parents whose children had joined unconventional religious groups, and also gave interviews to media around the world. <BR> <B>...The Cult Awareness Network not only supplied information, but gave parents references to &quot;deprogrammers.&quot; </B>Although CAN said it advocated only legal means to remove devotees from cults, some of the deprogrammers were convicted of using force. Now, many of the groups CAN described as cults have become increasingly accepted by society at large, including Scientology, the Unification Church, the Hare Krishnas, Boston Church of Christ, and Transcendental Mediation. <BR> <B>...A barrage of lawsuits filed for years by members of the Church of Scientology</B> drained CAN of $300,000 annually in legal fees. Many of the suits were dismissed, but one finally drove CAN into bankruptcy. It was brought by 18-year-old Jason Scott, who alleged that a local CAN volunteer referred his mother to a deprogrammer who then kidnapped and handcuffed him, gagged him with tape, and forced him to watch videos about cults. Scott won a $1.8 million judgment against CAN and now is the group's main creditor. <BR> <B>...A bankruptcy trustee recently sold CAN's name, logo, telephone number, and post office box</B> to the highest bidder: Los Angeles lawyer Steven L. Hayes, a Scientologist. Hayes said he is working with a group of people &quot;united in their distaste for CAN&quot; who plan to restart the group so it &quot;disseminates the truth about all religions,&quot; <I>The Washington Post</I> reported. Also up for auction are 270 boxes of files that reportedly contain confidential information about current and former cult members and efforts to free them. <BR> <B>...The hostile takeover of a nonprofit organization could set a dangerous precedent</B> for other nonprofit groups, said Paul Lawrence, an attorney for CAN and president of the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington state. It is highly unusual for a nonprofit organization to be forced to pay punitive damages based on the actions of a volunteer member, Lawrence said. Most nonprofits have volunteers &quot;out there acting in a way that the nonprofits can't hope to monitor,&quot; he told <I>The Washington Post</I>.    <BR> <B>...In the absence of CAN, the anti-cult movement has now turned to the Internet</B> to share information. Prominent anti-cult sites include <A HREF=http://rampages.onramp.net/~watchman/>Watchman Fellowship.</A>    </font></p>

Episcopalians embarrassed by church scandals</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The Episcopal Church is getting an earful from its members</B>. Over the past two years, the 2.5 million member denomination sent representatives to almost every diocese, where they listened to 3,000 people talk about what was on their minds. <BR> <B>...&quot;Our people are embarrassed,&quot;</B> said Bishop Chris Epting of Iowa. &quot;Scandal after scandal&quot; has shaken the church in the last three years, he said. &quot;Faithful, dedicated Episcopalians...are literally begging the Episcopal Church to lead and to project a worthy life.&quot; Epting reported accumulated results of the diocesan interviews to the church's Executive Council Nov. 7-11 in Toronto. <BR> <B>...The denomination's most recent scandal involves allegations of sexual decadence in the Diocese of Long Island</B>. An article in the December edition of <I>Penthouse</I> magazine includes descriptions of orgies in the sanctuary of St. Gabriel's Episcopal Church in Brooklyn, cross-dressing priests who model themselves after Marilyn Monroe and Madonna, a sex trade involving young Brazilian men, and a wedding of two men, one of them an Episcopal priest. The rector of the parish resigned after the denomination began investigating published reports of the allegations, news reports said. <BR> <B>...&quot;What is appalling is that this scandal apparently prompted so little investigation</B> or corrective measures by the Diocese of Long Island before a pornographic magazine decided to pursue some news leads,&quot; said <I>United Voice</I>, a conservative Episcopal publication. <BR> <B>...Others who were interviewed said the denomination is spiritually adrift</B> and needs strong leadership. There was a call for &quot;positive direction and a clear identity for the church,&quot; the report said. Some Episcopalians complained they do not share the social and political agenda of the national office. Others said they did not like the size and scope of the General Convention, and criticized the dual roles of the presiding bishop as spiritual leader and chief executive officer. Across the board, dioceses demanded more support for local ministries, fewer top-down directives, and better communication. <BR> <B>...The national church should have a role in some areas,</B> the report said. These include ecumenical relations, Anglican global relations, and world relief efforts. The Presiding Bishop's Fund for World Relief, the United Thank Offering, and national stewardship efforts were praised. <BR> <B>...Executive Council members listened to the complaints and issued new guidelines</B>. They include more support for local congregations; creating a pamphlet explaining church programs and finances; realigning of the denominational structure and the General Convention; and better communications between headquarters and the dioceses. <BR>      </font></p>

Sermon draws picketers, media to tiny church</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Members of Plymouth Congregational Church in Watervliet, Mich., had to walk through picket lines</B> and the media to get to church Sunday. The 60-member congregation has been besieged by protesters and reporters after pastor Don Campbell tried to bar two homosexual men from a service Nov. 10. When the men came to the church and sat in the front row, Campbell launched into an impromptu sermon about the evils of homosexuality. The situation degenerated into a shouting match with about 30 protesters.  <BR> <B>...&quot;How would you like to be me today?&quot;</B> Campbell asked from the pulpit yesterday as he began his sermon, titled &quot;Gay Liberation.&quot; As Kip Thumm, who has attended the church off and on since childhood, his partner Roberto Torres, and the rest of the congregation listened, Campbell said he wanted to &quot;talk to Kip and Roberto and any others here. Are the camera's rolling? I want this on tape.&quot; <BR> <B>...&quot;We welcome you to this church as two sinners</B>. Do you buy that? We're all sinners,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;Kip and Roberto, everyone else, homosexuals, adulterers, bank robbers, swindlers, you and everyone else is welcome here to seek salvation. If you are not sinners, we're not fit to be with you folks because we're all sinners here. All sinners are welcome in this church. If you're not sinners. I don't know where you go.&quot; Thumm, appeared to be caught off guard, and nodded. With that, Campbell told a story, concluded the service, and retreated to his office, <I>The News</I> said. Both sides left the church claiming victory. <BR><B>...Campbell received more than 100 phone calls and letters last week</B>, and Thumm received hundreds of calls of support and was visited by several ministers who said he was welcome to visit their churches, <I>The Detroit News</I> reported.     </font></p>

Doctor puts euthanasia instructions on the Internet</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Euthanasia software soon will be available on the Internet</B>, according to the Australian doctor who developed it. Dr. Philip Nitschke, who performed the world's first legal mercy killing, said Internet users could copy the software and instructions from a home page that is being developed, Reuters news service said. An estimated 50 million people worldwide use the Internet. <BR> <B>...&quot;We see no reason in restricting it in any way,&quot;</B> Nitschke said. Last month, he assisted in the killing of  one-time Christian missionary Bob Dent, hooking him to the machine with an intravenous tube. Australia's Northern Territory has the world's only voluntary euthanasia law. It enables people to give themselves lethal injections with the touch of computer keys. Nitschke said he also sent how-to-do-it kits overseas and around Australia using electronic mail. <BR> <B>...The software and the equipment needed to build the machine are simple and cost $160,</B> though the lethal drugs are difficult to obtain, Nitschke said. A doctor cannot lawfully hook a patient up to the machine anywhere outside the Northern Territory. <BR> <B>...Nitschke said he was developing another death machine that uses carbon monoxide</B> and an oxygen mask. This enabled people to end their lives without needing someone to insert intravenous tubes, he said. Nitschke said his machine is a &quot;slicker&quot; version of the suicide device designed by American euthanasia advocate Jack Kevorkian, who has attended more than 40 deaths.    </font></p>

Nicky Cruz preaches around the world, returns to the ghetto
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>More than 35 years after leaving a violent and angry New York City ghetto life, Nicky Cruz</B> still is delivering his message of God's love to gang members. <BR> <B>...Cruz has held evangelistic crusades in more than 40 countries</B> and led more than 10 million people to make professions of faith in Jesus Christ, his ministry said. He travels 400,000 miles a year, speaking at churches, banquets, and prisons 45 weekends a year. His autobiography, <I>The Cross and the Switchblade</I>, has been translated into 45 languages and is read by public school students in Scandinavian countries and the United Kingdom. Many foreigners are &quot;intrigued by American violence&quot; but their countries don't suffer from the same problems, according to Patrick Dow, who runs Cruz' ministry. <BR> <B>...Cruz once again is aiming his message at inner-city America. </B>&quot;In my heart, I have never left the ghetto,&quot; said Cruz, 57, who still commands respect on the streets. Since 1992, he has held crusades for gang members in Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix, Denver, and Colorado Springs. <BR> <B>...For three weeks before each gang crusade begins</B>, hundreds of former gangsters who now are Christians fan out through inner-city streets preaching, talking to gang members, and inviting them to Cruz' crusade. The volunteers -- many of whom are in various stages of rehabilitation -- come from churches started by Sonny Arguinzoni, a former heroin addict who 35 years ago successfully came through the first Teen Challenge drug center started by Cruz and pastor David Wilkerson of Times Square Church. <BR> <B>...Arguinzoni's group, Victory Outreach, has started more than 200 inner-city churches</B>. Membership is predominantly Hispanic, with many former hard-core drug addicts and convicts. The congregations are affiliated with the Assemblies of God and have their headquarters in LaPuente, Calif. <BR> <B>...For Cruz, it still is painful to share the story of his upbringing, </B>which he describes as &quot;foul and dysfunctional.&quot; Cruz' mother was a witch and his father a &quot;satanic spiritualist healer,&quot; he said. Both of Cruz' parents and his grandmother were sentenced to life in prison for murder, and his two brothers are awaiting trial for murder, he says. Yet, God has &quot;broken the generational curse&quot; on his life, he tells his audiences. <BR> <B>...In Denver this summer, 29,000 people attended Cruz' rallies</B>, and 2,500 filled out cards indicating their decision to become Christians, Dow told<I> Religion News Today</I>. Cruz is considering a similar crusade in New York City next summer. &quot;There is no quick or easy solution,&quot; he says. &quot;What has taken our country a generation to become may take a generation to repair.&quot;    </font></p>

Spiritual renewal in Budapest, Hungary</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Spiritual renewal is occurring in Budapest, Hungary, after 40 years of Communism.</B>  Twelve thousand people a week, including many young people, attend services at Hit Gyulkezete, comprising Europe's second-largest evangelical congregation.  The congregation, which meets in a sports center, has planted 120 local churches and is sending missionaries to Ukraine, Romania, Slovakia, and Serbia.  About 100,000 people have become Christians in the last five years through contact with Hit Gyulkezete, according to the missions group Operation Mobilization-Hungary. <BR> <B>...Several hundred gang members became Christians </B>in the last few<B> </B>months and are meeting in special youth services, the church said.  About 500 people are enrolled in the church's Bible school, St. Paul's Academy, which offers a 4 or 5 year theological training program that includes classes in Greek and Hebrew. <BR> <B>...Christians developed Hungary's AIDS-information program,</B> which contains a clear explanation of the gospel, OM said.  Of the 1,000 teachers trained to administer the <I>Youth on the Threshold of Life </I>program<I>, </I>20%-30% have become Christians, according to the Hungarian branch of Campus Crusade for Christ. <BR> <B>...High school graduates are required to learn about Christianity</B>, according to a law passed last September.  They must be able to describe when Christianity began, how it spread, who Jesus is, the meaning of Calvary, and explain terms such as &quot;salvation&quot; and &quot;redeemer.&quot;  Several Christian groups have developed and submitted teaching materials in response to the new law. <BR> <B>...Hungary regained its freedom of religion in 1990</B>. Christians reportedly make up 86.6% of the population, but only 15% attend church, according to Patrick Johnstone's <I>Operation World</I>. Most Hungarians are Catholic. Protestants make up 24.4% of the population.    </font></p>

Church can show Jesus film at federally funded senior center
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court today allowed an Albuquerque church</B> to use a city-owned, federally funded senior center to show the<I> Jesus</I> film and distribute Bibles. <BR> <B>...The case began in 1994, when Albuquerque rejected a request from Don Kimbro, pastor of the Church on the Rock,</B> to show the film and hand out large-print New Testaments. In denying the request, the city cited the Older Americans Act, a federal law that provides money for senior centers but requires that they not be used for religious instruction or worship. The city said the<I> Jesus</I> film, created and distributed by Campus Crusade for Christ, proselytizes by urging viewers to recite a prayer and become a Christian. <BR> <B>...A federal court ruled for the City of Albuquerque. But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with pastor Kimbro</B>, saying the policy constituted unlawful discrimination based on a particular viewpoint. The circuit court said senior centers are public forums and that allowing the film to be shown there would not imply endorsement of religion. <BR> <B>...Also today, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the U.S.  military's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy</B> regarding homosexuals. The challenge was brought  by former Lt. Paul Thomasson, who was forced to leave the Navy last year after writing a letter to his commander saying, &quot;I am gay.&quot;     </font></p>

Convention: Western missionaries have a big task ahead</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The task of Western missionaries is far from complete, </B>according to missions leader George Verwer. The founder of Operation Mobilization will plead the cause of world missions in a speech at the Urbana 96 Student Mission Convention, which starts tonight on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne. <BR> <B>...More than 20,000 students, missionaries, and pastors from 90 countries</B> are attending the five-day convention, held every three years. It is sponsored by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of the U.S.A. and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship-Canada.  <BR> <B>...Although non-Western missionaries are increasing in number and influence</B>, foreign nationals alone are not a &quot;shortcut toward getting the job done quickly,&quot; Verwer said. The task of evangelizing the world is too massive, and the areas without Christian witness are too numerous to do without either Western or national missionaries, he said. <BR> <B>...Verwer plans to challenge Urbana 96 delegates to work at least one or two years </B>in a different part of the world -- not only for the sake of others, but for their own spiritual development. The responsibility of all Christians to participate in Christ's Great Commission is the convention's major theme.  <BR> <B>...Approximately 300 convention seminars are designed to focus students on specific aspects of mission service</B> or cross-cultural witness. Some 240 exhibiting missionary-sending agencies, as well as 50 seminaries and Christian colleges, will offer information about specific opportunities for service. <BR> <B>...Delegates will hear about the needs of major ethnic people-groups </B>that have little or no opportunity to hear about Christ. They also will learn about needs in urban areas, among children and youth, and in the Islamic world. Other presentations<B> </B>will highlight<B> </B>the challenges of relativism and postmodernism on campuses and discuss competing faiths such as Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Specific tracks are designed for more than 900 church leaders and mission pastors attending. Keynote speakers, in addition to Verwer, include missions leaders from North America, South America, and Africa. <BR> <B>...&quot;The youth at Urbana are typically highly motivated and energetic Christians,&quot;</B> said convention director Dan Harrison. &quot;Xers today are doing some of the finest mission work I've ever seen,&quot; according to Harrison, a missionary for 30 years. A survey of 1993 Urbana delegates showed 90% feel they had something to offer as a missionary in another culture. Many of the delegates said they typically discuss their faith with nonbelievers, and one in four had already been on a missions conference lasting longer than a month. <BR> <B>...Urbana 96 marks the 50th anniversary of InterVarsity's first missions convention</B>, held in Toronto. Christy Wilson, who directed InterVarsity's convention in 1946, will address Urbana 96 delegates, and missionaries from each of Urbana's five decades will give testimonies. <BR> <B>...The <A HREF=http://www.gospelcom.net/iv/urbana>Urbana 96 Internet site</A> will allow people who can't attend</B> Urbana 96 to interact with the conference. The site will include regular updates from the convention on audio and video, and summaries of sessions. Keynote addresses will be aired on the Moody Broadcasting and Skylight Radio Networks.    </font></p>

Christians, Muslims maintain an uneasy peace in Bethlehem
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>In Bethlehem, the town synonymous with Christmas, most residents follow Islam</B>. Israeli troops pulled out of the town's center a year ago to make way for Palestinian self-rule. <BR> <B>...About a third of the 40,000 Arabs who live in the center of the city are Christians, </B>but more leave every year, <I>The London Times</I> reported. Some Muslims also leave, but those who remain have a higher birth rate than the Christians. Churches have dwindled to 20 in number, but there are 70 mosques. <BR> <B>...A mosque in Manger Square directly faces the Church of the Nativity</B>, the traditional birthplace of Jesus. Each Friday, Muslims prostrate themselves there, pledging allegiance to Allah. Traffic halts as clerics deliver their message over loudspeakers. <BR> <B>...A few of the speeches are aimed directly at Christians</B>. Last month, a Muslim cleric, angered by the visit of Christian fundamentalists from the United States, spoke out in a rare diatribe against Christians. The Palestinian Authority silenced him immediately, and no violence occurred. <BR> <B>...Peace and harmony are necessary for Bethlehem's tourist trade. </B>But the possibility of  terrorist attacks have scared away some tourists this year from visiting the town's extensive Christmas celebrations. Jalal Qumsiya, who owns the Paradise Hotel, told UPI that his business is down 30% compared with 1995. Few merchants say they expect the boom in tourism first imaged when Arabs and Israelis signed their 1993 peace accord. But Qumsiya, a Christian, still hopes for peace. &quot;I believe in miracles. It's the Holy Land and God won't forget us.&quot; <BR> ------- <BR> <B>Editor's Note</B>: Merry Christmas to all our readers from the staff at <I>Religion News Today</I>.    </font></p>

Halloween: It's not just for kids anymore</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Halloween, once an event just for kids, has grown in cultural significance</B> to become a month-long celebration for young and old -- a fact that concerns some Christians. <BR> <B>...Halloween is a multi-million dollar business.</B> For American merchants, it now is the biggest revenue-generator outside of  Christmas -- surpassing Mother's Day and Easter -- according to the National Retail Federation. Eighty percent of all Halloween costume rentals and 65% of sales are for adults, one trade group says. In addition to the costumes, Halloween now includes a host of items such as greeting cards, streamers, twinkling lights, and Oreo cookies with orange cream in the middle<B>. </B>A series of  48 children's horror books called <I>Goosebumps </I>(Parachute Press) sells five million copies each month, and more than 130 million have been sold since the series began in 1992. Scholastic Inc. produces a <I>Goosebumps</I> TV series, and other companies put the name <I>Goosebumps</I> on clothes, toys and other items.  <BR> <B>...The holiday is being celebrated in various ways around the country. </B>A<B> </B>San Francisco group, which has its roots in the lesbian and homosexual community, will hold the world's largest Macarena at a party in the Civic Center. Chicago will hold readings from Edgar Allan Poe's works and run a Haunts of Chicago walking and bus tour. New Orleans has vampire and ghost tours and a secret Halloween ritual starting at the Voodoo Museum. New York will hold its annual Greenwich Village Halloween Parade up Sixth Avenue. In Salem, Mass., site of the witch trials of 1692, there will be festivals playing up the city's history along with tours of the Salem Witch Museum and Witch Dungeon Museum.  <BR> <B>...Americans tend to have very divergent emotions about Halloween. </B>Some consider the day a positive way for people to deal with fear and crime, or praise it as a kind of national festival. But several school districts have placed restrictions on costumes and parties,<B> </B>saying they tend to be violent, offensive, or scary for children. Others promote alternative activities for the family that are clever, but not scary or threatening. <BR> <B>...Whether to celebrate Halloween has become highly controversial among Christians. </B>Psychologist James Dobson says he has mixed feelings about Halloween. The founder of Focus on the Family said the holiday's focus on the occult, witches, devils, and evil sends messages to children that &quot;Christian parents must regard as undesirable and dangerous.&quot; But some aspects of  the observance -- such as dressing up in costumes that are not occultic in theme and requesting treats while being supervised -- are harmless and fun, he said. Dobson advised parents to &quot;stay faithful to your own convictions and do what you think best,&quot; the ministry said. <BR> <B>...Some churches have called for a boycott of the day.</B> A few churches, taking an idea from a minister in Arvada, Colo., have put a new twist on traditional Halloween haunted houses. At Green Ridge Assembly of God Church's Judgment House in Scranton, Pa., visitors see depiction's of the aftermath of  an abortion, a funeral for an AIDS victim, teen suicide, and a fatal drug overdose. The climax is a trip to hell, hosted by a church member portraying Lucifer. The 30-minute presentation concludes with a visit to heaven.    </font></p>

Religion, morality important issues in races</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Issues related to religion and morality play key roles in Tuesday's balloting</B>. Americans will vote in races for president, U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, and governors. Voters also are taking action on 90 initiatives in 20 states and the District of Columbia. <BR> <B>...During the campaign, President Clinton openly expressed his religious faith.</B> A Southern Baptist who attends Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., Clinton speaks about religion often, using biblical phrases and allusions. The President confers regularly with several pastors, and reads books on spiritual topics. He takes a Bible to services, follows along with the readings, and takes notes in the margins, said James Dunn of the Baptist Joint Committee. Clinton, who loves music, has been seen with tears rolling down his face during hymns. <BR> <B>...The President has cast himself as a unifier</B>, saying that Republicans in the White House would be a source of social division. In Tampa, Fla., last weekend, from the pulpit of  St. Paul's African Episcopal Methodist Church, Clinton said some people seek to divide society by &quot;driving wedges between us and exploiting our fears and convincing us that our brothers and sisters of different races, different faiths, different walks of life, are our inherent enemies.&quot; <BR> <B>...But some of Clinton's actions evoked anger from evangelicals</B>, who say they can't believe he is a Christian because of his support for homosexual rights and legal abortion. The President's veto of a bill banning partial-birth abortions prompted a condemnation from his own denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention. The SBC expressed disapproval of Clinton's suggestion that God &quot;could have revealed to him in prayer&quot; that abortion is acceptable.   <BR> <B>...Republican challenger Bob Dole, a United Methodist, rarely speaks about his faith</B>. Dole started attending Sunday school at age three and taught it as a young man, <I>USA Today</I> said. In an interview with <I>World</I> magazine, Dole said he reads the Bible &quot;sometimes.&quot; His wife, Elizabeth, is known for speaking freely about her faith. Dole supports a constitutional amendment to ban abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman is at risk. He has said Clinton cannot provide the moral leadership the nation needs.  <BR> <B>...Control of Congress also is up for grabs this year. </B>Two years ago, Republican conservatives became the majority in Congress for the first time in 40 years, resulting in passage of a number of key conservative pieces of legislation. That could change after Tuesday. <BR> <B>...Also, measures to legalize gambling are on the ballots in seven states</B>. Initiatives would make gambling legal in Detroit and permit riverboat casinos on Ohio waterways. Other gambling initiatives are being decided in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, and Washington. <BR> <B>...Colorado voters will decide on a measure that would eliminate the real estate property tax exemption for churches</B>. Radio talk-show host John Patrick Michael Murphy, a critic of organized religion, is on a crusade to tax churches and nonprofit organizations. If the measure passes, some churches say they would go out of business. Numerous evangelical groups are based in Colorado Springs. <BR> <B>...Parental rights also is a hot issue in Colorado. </B>Voters will decide on a measure that would give parents the right to &quot;direct and control the upbringing, education, values, and discipline of their children.&quot; Proponents, who include Dole, say the measure would strengthen the rights of parents in controlling child rearing and the curriculum in public schools. Opponents say the measure would open the door to parental abuse and make it hard to prosecute child-abuse cases. Opponents also say the measure would delay the decisions of school boards, allow parents to demand the teaching of creationism, and stop confidential drug, alcohol, and birth-control counseling. Similar amendments are pending in 28 states, and a bill is awaiting action in Congress. <BR> <B>...On the ballot in California is a measure to allow doctors to prescribe marijuana</B> to some patients to relieve pain. That would open the door to legalization of the drug, critics say. The measure is being closely watched in other states. <BR> <B>...The governor's race in Washington presents a distinct choice to voters</B>. King County executive Gary Locke, 46, a Yale-educated Democrat who is the son of Chinese immigrants, faces former state Senate president Ellen Craswell, 64, a conservative Christian Republican grandmother. Craswell says she will use &quot;God's plan&quot; to run the state and dismantle portions of government not justified by Scripture. She says government should phase out welfare programs and that churches and nonprofit groups should take over. Craswell, who has 12 home-schooled grandchildren, criticizes public schools for not giving parents enough control. Locke, a Baptist, says he wants a distinct line between church and state. <BR> <B>...The Christian Coalition said it distributed 45 million voter guides in 125,000 churches nationwide</B> and contacted three million to five million voters in person or by telephone during the campaign. The guides compare the stands of Democratic and Republican candidates on issues such as abortion, prayer in public schools, and homosexuals in the military. Critics say they overwhelmingly favor Republicans.    </font></p>

Churches help save marriages</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The divorce rate fell in seven of eight American cities where pastors took action together </B>to prevent bad marriages and save good ones. Divorce rates in the Illinois cities of Peoria, Quincy, Moline, and Rock Island, as well as in Montgomery, Ala., and Albany, Ga., fell 8%-19% when action plans called Community Marriage Policies were implemented between 1986 and 1993, county records show. Only Rockford, Ill., which also adopted the policies, failed to achieve a decline in its divorce rate. <BR> <B>...The biggest drop occurred in Modesto, Calif., where the divorce rate declined 40% in a decade.</B> During the same period, the overall national divorce rate declined only slightly. <BR> <B>...The participating pastors promised to help prepare people for marriage, &quot;tune up&quot; existing marriages,</B> and overcome marital trouble when it arises. Typically, pastors imposed a four-month preparation period before marrying a couple; during the waiting period, couples take a test to evaluate their relationship. During the marriage, mature couples from the congregation are enlisted to mentor those experiencing marital rough spots. And all couples are directed to attend regular marriage &quot;tune-up&quot; sessions. <BR> <B>...Syndicated columnist Mike McManus devised the system and has crusaded for a decade to popularize it. </B>Now, churches in 52 cities have committed themselves to Community Marriage Policies. They include Austin, Texas; Birmingham, Ala.; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Fresno, Calif.; Lansing, Mich.; and Orlando, Fla. McManus is working to spread the program in larger cities including Minneapolis, Dallas, and Washington, D.C. <BR> <B>...In each city, up to half the pastors signed a covenant promising to help marriages.</B> In Austin, Texas, 252 pastors from 30 denominations signed the covenant, and in Jackson, Miss., 200 signed. Eventually, marriage records from more cities will be examined to determine the change in divorce rates during the period when the Community Marriage Policies were in effect. <BR> <B>...The pre-marital inventory administered under the program can &quot;predict with 80% accuracy who will divorce,&quot; </B>McManus said. The test is rigorous, designed to &quot;help people who are inappropriately matched to discover it in time.&quot; Marital &quot;tune-up&quot; conferences can include any of a number of successful programs developed by various denominations. As far as enlisting older, more mature mentors, &quot;Every church has couples with strong marriages who can help other couples -- but have never been asked,&quot; he told <I>Religion News Today</I>. For information, write 9500 Michael's Court, Bethesda, Md. 20817.     </font></p>

Christianity is growing slowly worldwide </H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Growth in Christianity is keeping pace with world population growth.  </B>Christians comprise 33.9% of the world's 5.89 billion people today, according to researcher David Barrett.  That is up slightly from 33.7% of the world's 3.7 billion people in 1970.  Barrett is compiling the figures for the next edition of the <I>World Christian Encyclopedia</I>, a comprehensive survey of world Christianity published by the Global Evangelization Movement. <BR> <B>...Charismatic and Pentecostal churches are growing fastest,</B> expanding from 5.9% of the Christian church in 1970 to nearly 25% today.  Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 49.7% of Christians.  They are followed in size by Protestants (19.1%) and the Orthodox (10.8%).  <BR> <B>...Christianity is growing fastest in Africa and Asia</B>.  In Africa, there are now some 310 million Christians, compared with 119 million in 1970, according to Barrett.  Asian Christians increased in number from 90 million to 299 million during the same period.  Some 26.4% of the world's Christians live in Europe, but that continent's percentage of world Christianity is declining fast, down from nearly 40% in 1970, Barrett's figures show.  Latin America and the Caribbean are home to the next largest group of Christians (22.6%), followed by Africa (15.5%), Asia (15%), North America (10.2%), and Oceania (1%). <BR> <B>...Islam is growing more quickly than Christianity.  </B>The world's second largest religion expanded from 15.3% of the world's 1970 population to 19.6% today, Barrett said.  Since 1970, Hinduism grew from 12.9% to 13.7% of the world's population, and Buddhism declined from 6.4% to 5.6%. <BR> <B>...The worldwide expansion of cities continues</B>, with an estimated 46% of the world's population now living in cities.  There are now 3,960 metropolises of 100,000 people or more, an increase of 60% since 1970.  Some 400 cities have more than a million people.  The urban poor and slum dwellers comprise 48% of the world's population, up from 24.6% in 1970.    </font></p>

&quot;Depressing&quot; level of racism exists, study finds
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Racial animosity and segregation still are prevalent in the South, </B>according to a government study conducted after recent church arsons. The finding is the result of  public forums conducted by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a bipartisan and multiracial group. Nearly 90 black churches and 72 white churches in the South have burned since January 1995. <BR> <B>...Banks, schools, and swimming pools in Greene County, Ala., still are racially segregated, </B> the commission found. In Mississippi, animosity between the races is still so prevalent that blacks refuse to attend forums at a predominantly white college, <I>USA Today</I> reported. <BR> <B>...The fires &quot;are a message that we need to discuss race honestly,&quot; </B>Melvin Adams, director of the commission's central region, told<I> </I>the newspaper<I>.</I> The facts are &quot;depressing,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...Racial hatred is a motivation for more than half the fires,</B> according to National Council of Churches spokesperson Carol Fouke. This includes animosity directed mainly at blacks, but also toward Latinos, Vietnamese, and whites who spoke out against racism, Fouke said. So  far, the NCC's Burned Churches Fund has distributed $2 million to rebuild or restore 24 churches, she said. The fund has received $4.6 million and has an additional $1.2 million in pledges. The federal government also has made $10 million in loan guarantees available to the churches, Fouke said.    <BR> <B>...Meanwhile, a 13-year-old girl who burned down a black church sanctuary in Charlotte, N.C</B>., embraced the church's pastor in court and apologized to him Tuesday. The teen-ager, whose name was not disclosed because she is a juvenile, admitted setting fire to Matthews Murkland Presbyterian Church's former sanctuary, <I>The Charlotte Observer</I> said. She has been sentenced to 12 months' probation, ordered to perform 200 hours of community service, and will continue mental-health treatment. The fire appeared to be an attempt to make a statement against Christianity, not African-Americans, police said. Pastor Larry Hill said the girl seemed truly sorry for her crime <BR> <B>...After the hearing, the girl's mother</B>, a member of Matthews United Methodist Church, talked about the ordeal. &quot;A lot of good has come out of this,&quot; she said. &quot;We have come to realize what is truly important in life: God, family and friends. We would like to thank Rev. Hill of Matthews Murkland and his congregation for their compassion, prayers, and especially for their forgiveness.&quot;    </font></p>

Many use the Bible to learn how to read</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Teaching illiterate people to read by using the Bible</B> has transformed the lives of tens of thousands of individuals. In 20 years, 50,000 tutors have been trained to use a method developed by American linguist William Kofmehl. Those tutors are spread out in 25 countries throughout North America, Africa, Asia, and Latin America; half are in Haiti, and 10,000 in the southeast African nation of Malawi. <BR> <B>...Kofmehl, a 53-year-old Lutheran layman, </B>has studied at schools in the United States, England, and Denmark as well as with Wycliffe Bible Translators. He runs Christian Literacy Associates, working from office space donated by St. John's Lutheran Church in West View, Pa., near Pittsburgh. Kofmehl has worked in relative anonymity at the facility since 1975, when he and his wife, Linda, used a $250 grant from the local Lutheran Synod to start the Allegheny County Literacy Council, which evolved into Christian Literacy Associates.  <BR> <B>...Adults and children can learn to read from Kofmehl's method. </B>It has been particularly effective with first and second graders who are &quot;about to fail&quot; because of their inability to read, he said. Because of the program's religious content, it can't be used by public schools, although it can be used to train parents or church members as tutors.  <BR> <B>...Tutors working with children &quot;can make a tremendous difference</B> in a relatively short time,&quot; Kofmehl told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Some children suffer from learning disabilities, but most who fail to read merely lack individual attention in the classroom and at home, he said. <BR> <B>...About half the world is illiterate.</B> That statistic includes 35 million Americans who read at less than a fifth-grade level, meaning they can't understand a newspaper, directions, or fill out a job application. &quot;The Bible is locked away from their use,&quot; Kofmehl said. Such people are scattered over cities, rural areas, and even suburbs. &quot;Any church that has kids is bound to have several who are going to fail if they don't get individual help in reading,&quot; he said.  <BR> <B>...Many adults who are illiterate live in fear that someone will find out</B>. Some are entrepreneurs who work with their hands but can't manage other parts of their business. A substantial number of  prisoners are illiterate; when they are released they will have two strikes against them -- illiteracy and a prison record -- unless someone teaches them to read. <BR> <B>...Literacy tutoring using the Bible serves a dual purpose: </B>helping people improve their social situations while evangelizing them. &quot;It's nice to take care of two things at the same time,&quot; Kofmehl said. Tutoring opportunities are available to Christians who may never have been involved in an outreach, he said. They can teach someone in their family, a person who is mentally handicapped, or a prisoner. <BR> <B>...Christian Literacy materials are used as resources </B>by a variety of ministries in numerous denominations. They are available in a textbook and on compact disc. There is also an advanced teacher's handbook, a game book for young children, and Bible stories using 40 of the most commonly used words. A four-hour workshop on videotape  trains viewers in the basic tutoring method. For information, contact <A HREF= http://lightp.bevd.blacksburg.va.us >Project Light</A> on the Internet or by Email at light@infi.net. The Virginia Beach-based Project Light develops software to help Christians teach people to read the Bible in their own language and to teach English as a Second Language. Kofmehl can be contacted by Email at drliteracy@aol.com.    </font></p>

Buddhists aiming for mainstream America</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Seven hundred prominent Buddhists met in Boston Jan. 18-19 </B>at the largest Buddhism conference ever held in the United States.  <I>Buddhism in America</I> gathered experts from Buddhist schools in the United States including the Tibetan, Japanese Zen, and Theravadan, the practice common in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, the<I> Boston Globe</I> reported.  Some Buddhist schools of thought accentuate the contemplative life, and others emphasize social action.  The conference included 50 workshops and lectures by 35 professors and spiritual masters, and an evening of Tibetan sacred music and dance. <BR> <B>...Conference participants discussed ways to increase the influence </B>of Buddhism in the United States.  A keynote speaker was John Kabat-Zinn, director of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.  Kabat-Zinn, known for introducing Buddhist meditation to the treatment of chronic pain and stress, challenged participants to consider how Buddhism &quot;might best be introduced into the lives and institutions of mainstream America&quot; including medicine, inner-city communities, prisons, and sports. <BR> <B>...Buddhism's emphasis on meditation appeals to people</B> <B>seeking relief</B> from hectic work and family lives.  Meditation -- either through focused silence or ritual chanting -- is meant to develop calm, concentration, and positive emotions such as friendliness. Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, a son of Pentecostal ministers, uses Zen Buddhism to inspire unity among his players, according to his 1995 book <I>Sacred Hoops: Spiritual Lessons of A Hardwood Warrior</I>.    <BR> <B>...The title Buddha was first given to Siddharta Gautama, who</B> <B>lived 2,500 years ago</B> in northern India.  He did not claim to be God, but rather one who attained a mental state of being fully &quot;awake&quot; and aware of life.  Buddhism spread to Sri Lanka and south East Asia, Tibet, China, Mongolia, Japan, and, in the last century, to the West.  Buddhism almost died out in India a thousand years ago, though it has been recently revived there.    </font></p>

Pope says evolution is &quot;more than just a theory&quot;
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Evolution is a valid explanation of the origin of mankind and is compatible with the Christian faith, Pope John Paul II proclaimed. </B>The Pope, in a letter to his chief  panel of scientific experts, declared his belief that the human body is not the immediate creation of God, but rather the product of a gradual process of evolution. John Paul II made it clear, however, that he regards the human soul as the product of God's immediate, divine creation. The soul is not subject to evolution, which is &quot;incapable of establishing the dignity of man,&quot; he said.  <BR> <B>...The evolution of man and other species through natural selection is &quot;more than just a theory,&quot; </B>the Pope told the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. The results of various studies, done independently from each other, are &quot;a significant argument&quot; in favor of the accuracy of evolution, the Pope wrote. Church observers emphasized that the Pope was not presenting his statement as a formal teaching of the Catholic Church, but discussing scientific evidence. Nevertheless, the Pope's statement put the weight of his authority firmly behind the idea that evolution is a fact. <BR> <B>...The Pope's statement did not address the apparent conflict with biblical versions of the creation</B> of the universe and Adam and Eve. It also did not mention Charles Darwin by name. Darwin proposed his views that human beings are evolved from apes in the 1859 work,<I> On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</I>, and the 1871 treatises, <I>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</I>. <BR> <B>...The Italian press reacted with banner headlines.</B> &quot;The Pope says we may descend from monkeys,&quot; the conservative newspaper <I>Il Giornale</I> said on its front page. The Pope has &quot;made peace with Darwin,&quot; said <I>La Repubblica</I>. <BR> <B>...The Pope's statement is certain to provoke disapproval from Christians who take a literal approach</B> to Genesis, called &quot;creationists.&quot; Their viewpoint, highlighted in the 1925 trial of Tennessee teacher John Scopes, has recently been reopened. A bill that would have banned teaching evolution as fact was narrowly defeated in the Tennessee legislature this year.  <BR> <B>...The problem of reconciling the biblical account of creation and the findings of evolutionary science</B> has been less rancorous in the Catholic church. For several decades, Catholic theology has held that the depiction of creation in Genesis is a symbolic presentation that leaves room for scientific theories of the origins of the universe and mankind. Many theologians, both Catholic and Protestant, do not believe the theory of evolution conflicts with the doctrine that God created the world and made man in His own image. <BR> <B>...The Pope's statement was seen as the latest illustration that the Catholic Church is willing to amend</B> what it finds are erroneous teachings. The Church also recently apologized for an infamous wrong, its persecution of Galileo for teaching that the Earth moves around the Sun.    </font></p>

Colorado rejects real estate taxes for churches</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>In addition to choosing a President, American voters on Tuesday decided a record 91 statewide measures</B>, the most since the initiative process began in 1904. Here is a roundup of results in measures closely watched by religious voters: <BR> <B>...Real estate taxation of churches was defeated. </B>Colorado voters defeated by an 83-17 margin a measure that had sent shivers through the state's religious and tax-exempt communities.<B> </B>The proposed change to the state constitution, Amendment 11, would have required churches and other nonprofit groups to pay property taxes. Voters rejected it 83%-17%. If the amendment had passed, it would have stripped most real estate tax exemptions from churches and nonprofit organizations, while keeping the tax-exempt status of nonprofit schools and property being used to &quot;house low-income elderly, disabled, homeless, or abused persons.&quot; <BR> <B>...Parental rights amendment was defeated. </B>Fifty-eight percent of Colorado voters turned down an amendment to the state's Bill of Rights that would have enshrined the right of  parents to &quot;direct and control the upbringing, education, values and discipline of their children.&quot; Debate had been whether the amendment would have helped or hurt children. Colorado was a test state for the controversial amendment, backed primarily by Of The People, an Arlington, Va., organization. Opponents such as teachers, social workers, and the American Civil Liberties Union said the amendment would make it harder to prosecute child abuse cases and lead to fights over what is taught in schools. Proponents said parents are losing control over their children to schools and the government. <BR> <B>...Gambling results are mixed. </B>Nine states voted on gambling. Here are the results: <br>   <B>Arizona: </B>Approved a measure to permit more Indian casinos. <br> <B> Arkansas:</B> Turned down a state lottery, legalization of charitable bingo, and authorization of up to three casinos in Hot Springs. <br> <B> Colorado: </B>Rejected gambling in the city of Trinidad. <br> <B> Louisiana: </B>Six parishes with the state's 14 riverboat gambling kept it, and 23 others voted to allow it for the first time. Thirty of the state's 64 parishes kept video poker, while 34 rejected it.  <br> <B> Michigan:</B> Passed a statewide proposal to permit up to three casinos in Detroit. Michigan also rejected a ban on bingo for political fund-raisers. <br>  <B>Nebraska:</B> Rejected a constitutional amendment to allow off-track betting. <br>  <B>Ohio:</B> For the second time in six years, voters rejected a plan to put eight riverboat casinos in four counties. Gov. George Voinovich commented that voters saw through the &quot;slick ads, false claims, and deceptive messages&quot; of the gambling industry. <br>  <B>Washington:</B> Rejected a measure to allow up to 500 slot machines at Indian casinos. <br>  <B>West Virginia: </B>Jefferson County allowed video gambling at Charles Town racetrack. <BR> <B>...Marijuana was approved as a prescription drug. </B>In California, mercy for the sick outweighed worries over drug abuse. Voters approved by a 56-44 margin a proposition legalizing marijuana, allowing doctors to prescribe it to fight pain in serious illness. Proposition 215 legalizes the cultivation, possession, and use of cannabis with a doctor's authorization. If the proposition survives court challenges, it would legalize marijuana for the first time since the early part of the century. Police opposed the proposal, warning that unscrupulous physicians would take advantage of it. Opponents plan to fight for tight scrutiny of prescriptions and tough penalties for abusers. <BR> <B>...Liberal won the Washington governorship. </B>In the governor's race in Washington, avowedly liberal Democrat Gary Locke beat Republican Ellen Craswell, who opposes abortion, calls homosexuality sinful, and vowed to fill government with &quot;godly&quot; people. The margin was 59% to 41%. Craswell's campaign had been backed by 2,000 conservative religious volunteers. <BR> <B>...Woman won a Louisiana Senate seat. </B>In a close race, Democrat Mary Landrieu edged Republican Rep. Woody Jenkins to become Louisiana's first female senator. Landrieu, who is pro-choice on the abortion issue, overcame a warning from Catholic Archbishop Philip Hannan that voting for her would be a sin. Jenkins is a 49-year-old Christian conservative. <BR> <B>...Across the country, 16% of voters identified themselves as members of the religious right</B>, while 80% said they were not. Some 38% of voters said they were Protestant, 29% Catholics, and 17% part of another Christian denomination. Three percent said they were Jewish and 8% said they had no religion. In a separate question, about 5% of voters identified themselves as homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual. These figures were complied from television networks and newspaper wire services.    </font></p>

Charities wish they had been warned by ECFA about New Era
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Evangelical groups are asking questions about their financial watchdog, </B>the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. The ECFA scrutinizes the policies of more than 800 member charities. Its purpose has been questioned since the 1995 collapse of the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy, which resulted in hundreds of charities losing millions of dollars. <BR> <B>...Some charities say they are disappointed that the ECFA didn't warn its members</B> to steer clear of New Era. They also wonder whether the council is equipped to protect its members from similar scams in the future.  <BR> <B>...&quot;We are all disappointed that the ECFA didn't take the big-picture look </B>with New Era and ask the questions earlier,&quot; said Hanz Finzel, executive director of CBInternational, an organization based in Wheaton, Ill., that supports Baptist missionaries around the world. Because of the large size of the New Era operation and the many ECFA members involved, &quot;they should have looked into it,&quot; he told <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>. <BR> <B>...The ECFA decided it was beyond its mission to warn members about New Era</B>, according to Rollin A. Van Broekhoven, a federal judge who chairs the ECFA's board of directors. &quot;We had no jurisdiction with New Era to go in and see if what they were saying was real,&quot; he told <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>. ECFA president Paul D. Nelson said his organization cannot advise its members how to invest their money, a decision that belongs to the board of directors of each group. <BR> <B>...If the ECFA had been &quot;perceptive enough to know&quot;</B> that a scandal was brewing, it certainly would have warned its members,  Nelson told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Nelson said the ECFA made some telephone calls about New Era and &quot;ran into the same thing everybody else did&quot; -- comments that the group was &quot;the most wonderful thing that ever happened.&quot; Nelson said he did &quot;caution a few organizations who asked about it,&quot; advising them to make their own decisions about possible involvement with New Era. Investigators say New Era was a pyramid scheme in which earlier donors were paid by the deposits of later donors. <BR> <B>...The structure of ECFA could limit its effectiveness, some say. </B>The ECFA lacks legal authority to enforce its rules governing financial disclosure, the makeup of a charity's board, and fund-raising appeals. But the group says it does not hesitate to crack down on members who break the rules.<I> The Chronicle of Philanthropy</I> reported that 23 groups have been expelled or dropped out of the council in each of the last five years because they have not kept up with the council's standards. <BR> <B>...Robert C. Andringa, President of the Coalition for Christian Colleges and Universities</B>, said he'd like to see the ECFA's oversight function not be &quot;paid for by member dues.&quot; Membership in the Herndon, Va.-based ECFA, which costs up to $6,400 a year, depending on the organization's size, allows groups to display the ECFA logo on their fund-raising appeals. Finzel said CBInternational joined the ECFA last year because he believed that doing so would help attract donations. <BR> <B>...The ECFA has been praised for its role in the settlement of lawsuits related to New Era. </B>The group organized United Response, an association of religious groups that were involved with New Era. United Response has facilitated an agreement between charities that made money in the fund-raising plan and those that lost out in the deal. The agreement, which could be finalized next year, will allow New Era creditors to get as much as 85% of their money back, Nelson said. <BR> <B>...&quot;The question is whether the ECFA should change its mission statement&quot;</B> to become involved in things that &quot;don't directly relate to our standards,&quot; Van Broekhoven said. The board of directors will discuss the issue next year, Nelson said.    </font></p>

Participants in solemn assembly call for repentance</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>About 500 people gathered in Washington, D.C., for three days last week to fast and pray for revival.</B> Organizers of the National Solemn Assembly say the<B> </B>Oct. 24-26 gathering was based on the Old Testament Book of Joel. There, the prophet called for the people to &quot;cry out to the Lord&quot; for God's mercy rather than judgment. The event took place on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol, in Lafayette Square across from the White House, and at nearby Calvary Baptist Church. <BR> <B>...The featured speakers were 18 fiery national leaders. </B>They included Gary Bergel of Intercessors for America; author George Grant; Jay Grimstead of the Coalition on Revival; former Republican presidential candidate Alan Keyes; author Peter Marshall; radio host Janet Parshall; evangelist Richard Owen Roberts; and anti-abortion activist Randall Terry. <BR> <B>...&quot;We are in the midst of the greatest crisis our nation and the world have ever known,&quot;</B> Keyes told the crowd. &quot;Stand up for God's will and what is right in His sight,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...Christians must reject worldly standards, </B>speakers said.<B> </B>&quot;When you have a low view of God, a high view of self, and your own view of sin, there is spiritual and moral decline,&quot; Roberts said. Early Americans knew that God punished sin, so they sought &quot;quick and thorough repentance.&quot; <BR> <B>...Parents need to wage a &quot;battle for godliness&quot; in their homes,</B> said Doug Phillips of the Home School Legal Defense Association. Phillips said he has seen wonderful results when fathers &quot;love their children so much that they are willing to give up everything in the world to see those children rise up in righteousness.&quot; <BR> <B>...Political leaders must repent</B>, said Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition. He prayed for the overturn of  &quot;legislative and executive actions which export abortion, infanticide, homosexuality, and atheistic education.&quot; <BR> <B>...Christians must elect godly officials</B> and &quot;denounce, withstand, and defeat officials who despoil our godly heritage or defy God's eternal law by their public actions or private behavior,&quot; the group said in a proclamation. <BR> <B>...Some of the strongest words were directed toward the evangelical church, </B>described as being awash in apathy and neglect. Churches are &quot;impotent&quot; and pastors &quot;mute&quot; in the face of evil, the group's proclamation said. The evangelical movement is &quot;characterized by an arrogance that is almost beyond belief,&quot; Roberts said. He cited the &quot;neglect of prayer, the involvement of Philistine methodology, the moral evils, and the doctrinal corruption.&quot; Church services have lost their &quot;godly glory,&quot; said Regent University Professor Michael Brown. <BR> <B>...&quot;If we continue in this path, we will be utterly destroyed</B>. No man can save us. But if we will meet God's conditions, there is still hope,&quot; the proclamation said.    </font></p>

Slave-trading in Sudan</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Children are being made into slaves on a massive scale in Sudan</B>, Christian Solidarity International alleges. The Swiss-based organization said tens of thousands of children have been abducted in raids permitted by the African nation's Islamic government. The government, based in Khartoum, has battled the Southern-based Sudan People's Liberation Army, composed of Christian and animist rebels, for 13 years. The rebels are demanding more autonomy from the Islamic-oriented government. More than 1 million people have died in the conflict. <BR> <B>...Tens of thousands of African children have been abducted from their families</B> in raids approved by Khartoum and are enslaved in the North, said CSI's Hans Stuckelberger. A Protestant pastor, Stuckelberger made his charges last week in a letter to the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights.  <BR> <B>...Christian Solidarity official John Eibner made a clandestine visit to Sudan last month</B>, Reuters news service said. Eibner was able to purchase and free 58 slaves, who told him they had been forced to assume a Muslim identity and were often beaten, the report said. <BR> <B>...According to United Nations human rights official Gaspar Biro</B>, who visited Sudan in August, the Sudanese army has been ordered to collect women and the elderly -- as well as children -- and take them to government-controlled areas. <BR> <B>...Khartoum has said it is concerned about the charges</B>. The government reportedly has appointed an investigative committee and has opened a center for traumatized children.    </font></p>

Jewish industrialist leaves his fortune to Christian groups
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR>   <BR>  <B>Wealthy businessman Armand Hammer made a deathbed conversion  to Christianity</B> and left his fortune to evangelical Christian  organizations, reports say. Hammer was raised in a secular Jewish  family that was involved in left-wing politics. During his lifetime,  he donated hundreds of millions of dollars of his Occidental Petroleum  fortune to support the arts, cancer research, and world peace.  Now, six years after his death, Hammer's fortune is supporting  the Christian causes of his grandson Michael, who is sole executor  of the estate.  <BR>  <B>...Hammer's fortune has been directed to groups including Jews  for Jesus</B>, Italy for Christ, Don Dennis Ministries, Marty  Goetz Ministries, and Mike Barber Ministries. Money also is being  directed to an evangelistic foundation set up by Michael's father-in-law,  a former Tulsa banker who is a lay preacher<I>.</I>  <BR>  <B>...Michael Hammer became a Christian in 1985</B> after meeting  and marrying fitness instructor Dru Ann Mobley. Before Michael  became a Christian, his life was filled with drinking and drugs,  he told <I>The Washington Post</I>. &quot;Dru sure opened my eyes,&quot;  said Michael, who left his job as vice president of Occidental  a year after his grandfather died to take over management of the  estate full-time. If Michael dies, Dru would manage the estate,  according to Hammer's will.    <BR>  <B>...More than 100 claims and lawsuits have been brought</B>  by charities, family members, mistresses, and an illegitimate  daughter, all of whom were cut off from Hammer's will during his  final months. Michael's father and sister, who inherited only  $250,000 each, sued the estate and settled with Michael for about  $1 million each, news reports said.           </font></p>

Prayer summits</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A pastors' prayer-retreat movement is growing around the world</B>. Participants describe the four-day retreats -- called Pastor's Prayer Summits -- as life-changing experiences that lead to long-term changes in their personal lives and ministries. The retreats have grown in numbers from the first one in Portland, Ore., in 1989 to 120 this year. A total of 301 summits have been held in 85 cities in six countries. <BR> <B>...&quot;The growth of the movement has been phenomenal,&quot;</B> said Terry Dirks of International Renewal Ministries. &quot;There is a sense of desperation for the intervention of God, a hunger for revival, a passion to seek the face of the Lord, and a desire for unity in the body of Christ,&quot; he said. IRM, a ministry of Multnomah Bible College in Portland, organizes and facilitates the summits. <BR> <B>...Most summits are held in the United States, but they have taken place in Japan, Poland, Russia</B>, <B>Israel, Australia, Canada, and Mexico</B>. All of those countries have been equally receptive to the summits, Dirks said. In Australia, 15 summits were scheduled after IRM leaders held a series of retreats and meetings across the continent this summer. One pastor said Australia had &quot;never seen anything like this.&quot; <BR> <B>...So far, a majority of summit participants are white evangelicals</B>. But 18% of the pastors now come from mainline denominations and a growing number are African-American, Hispanic, or Asian, IRM said. The summits often result in &quot;incredible incidents&quot; of reconciliation across denominations and racial lines.  <BR> <B>...The summits have no scheduled speakers or set agenda</B>. In addition to praying, pastors usually talk, sing, worship, and even engage in impromptu confession of their sins. Often, a participant is able to be frank with at least one other man about his personal or professional struggles. The new spiritual and personal bonds often last well after the retreat ends. Friendships have resulted in the formation of ongoing prayer groups, cooperative evangelistic efforts, and a citywide atmosphere in which pastors pray for rather than criticize each other, leaders say.  <BR> <B>...Other types of prayer summits have begun as an offshoot of the Pastor's Prayer Summits</B>. These include retreats for pastors' wives, church board members, women in leadership positions, lay leaders, and college students. IRM is working cooperatively with other evangelistic groups including the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Luis Palau Evangelistic Association, Promise Keepers, Discipling A Whole Nation, Concerts of Prayer International, and the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. IRM and DAWN plan a joint consultation on prayer and city-wide evangelism Nov. 4-6 in Asheville, N.C. For information on the consultation, call (704) 938-9111. IRM's phone number is (503) 251-6455.    </font></p>

Congress will consider altering tax exemptions for nonprofit
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Tax exemptions granted to nonprofit groups could change dramatically in the upcoming Congress</B> if  U.S. Rep. Nancy Johnson gets her way. The Connecticut Republican, who was narrowly re-elected last week to a seventh term, heads a House Ways and Means subcommittee that monitors the Internal Revenue Service. She plans to hold &quot;very in-depth&quot; hearings to determine if the exemptions are warranted and make any necessary changes in the tax code, she told <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy.</I>  <BR> <B>...Tax laws have not kept up with the way some nonprofits operate</B>, and some nonprofits receiving tax benefits act more like advocacy groups and lobbyists, she said. Although the law bars nonprofits from devoting a large part of their efforts to lobbying and prohibits participation in partisan campaigns, they are allowed to inform the public about specific issues. Johnson said, however, that some nonprofits cross the line from education to politics.   <BR> <B>...Since it is hard to draw the line between education and advocacy, </B>Johnson wants Congress to create subcategories of charities and provide different taxes to each<B>. </B>Johnson said nonprofits that give direct services, such as soup kitchens or museums, should be placed in a separate category with different tax laws from those whose main activity is education on various issues.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Operation Rescue plans to display giant photographs of aborted babies</B> to passersby on busy, downtown streets in 32 American cities from Oct. 13-Nov. 5. In each city, the group will bring at least 100 signs to its two-hour demonstrations. Demonstrators will hold up the posters -- which are 4 x 5 feet and 4 x 6 feet -- where traffic is slow and &quot;people have to take a good look,&quot; said Jeff White, director of Operation Rescue California, organizer of  the demonstrations. <BR> <B>...The posters contain a photo of a baby's head held in a pair of forceps</B>. It's face is missing from the upper lip down, but it has hair and is identifiable as human, White said. A second photo depicts pieces of a  baby's body in reassembled form. <BR> <B>...&quot;The tortured faces of these babies&quot; show the tragedy of abortion</B> that Americans are trying to ignore, White told <I>Religion News Today</I>. &quot;If they won't look at it, we will take it right to them.&quot; <BR> <B>...Reactions have been immediate -- and sometimes violent -- when the posters were displayed</B> this May and June in 24 Western U.S. cities, and outside the Republican and Democratic conventions, White said.  At least two women on their way to getting an abortion have changed their minds, White said. Also, angry passersby have ripped up or thrown paint on the signs in several cities, and often complain that children should not be forced to see the posters, he said. &quot;It's been hot on the street. We have to be constantly on guard.&quot; <BR> <B>...White said the group hopes to stir up even more indignation</B>, so that &quot;people will try to create laws to stop us.&quot; That would start a national debate &quot;to see if we can show the signs.&quot;  <BR> <B>...The demonstrations are planned</B> in Las Vegas, Ariz.; Denver, Colo.; Omaha, Neb.; Kansas City and  St. Louis, Mo.; Louisville, Ky.; Indianapolis and  Fort Wayne, Ind.; Toledo, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Pa.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Newark, N.J.; Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Va.; Durham and Charlotte, N.C.; Columbia, S.C.; Atlanta, Ga.; Birmingham, Ala.; Memphis, Tenn.; Little Rock, Ark.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and El Paso, Texas; and San Bernardino, Calif.    </font></p>

Prison Fellowship will operate the nation's first Christian
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Texas' Board of Criminal Justice voted unanimously Nov. 15 to allow Prison Fellowship</B>, an evangelical organization founded by Charles Colson, to operate a Bible-based program for 200 soon-to-be-released inmates. It will be located at the Jester II unit, a minimum-security lockup in Sugar Land, near Houston. <BR> <B>...The program will be operated at no cost to the prison system. </B>Prison Fellowship will provide hundreds of trained volunteers to administer the program, the group said. The first-year cost to PF is estimated at $1.5 million. PF said it would seek payment for the program if it is extended beyond the two-year pilot project, but acknowledged that it is not assured of any payment at all. Criminal justice board member Allan Polunsky said he would never support payments to groups offering religious programs, because that would amount to state support for religion, he told <I>The Houston Chronicle</I>.  <BR> <B>...Christian beliefs will be the basis for the Jester II program.</B> It aims to change attitudes of selected prisoners who are within 18 months of release and to get them to accept responsibility for past conduct. The program includes counseling for prisoners and their families and restitution for victims. A number of Prison Fellowship programs could be used, including seminars, Bible studies, and one-on-one mentoring. <BR> <B>...&quot;Restorative justice&quot; for the inmate, the family, and the community</B> is the basis of the program, said C. Ronald Kariker, the Houston-area Prison Fellowship director. The program encourages repentance and &quot;a new birth spiritually,&quot; he said. The program is open to members of all religious groups. About half of Texas prison inmates say they are Christian and about a third are Muslim. It will not affect existing drug-counseling or educational programs. Inmates not enrolled in the program would be moved to other units. <BR> <B>...A similar, 20-year Prison Fellowship effort in Brazil reduced repeat offenses to 5%,</B> Reston, Va.-based Prison Fellowship said. Texas has been struggling to find ways to keep ex-convicts from returning to prison. Prisoners in the Brazil program &quot;had become a close-knit family,&quot; said Carol Vance, a member of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice board and former Harris County district attorney. He visited the Brazil program last December. Prisoners there cared about each other's welfare, had a positive outlook, and had confidence they would make it on the outside, Vance told<I> The Houston Chronicle</I>. <BR> <B>...The Jester II program is scheduled to go into effect in January</B>. After volunteers are trained, the first 40 inmates could be enrolled by April, with 100 by the end of 1997 and 200 by the end of 1998. Ultimately, the entire 378-bed Jester II prison could be dedicated to the program, PF said.    </font></p>

Supreme Court to rule in important religious freedom case
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>...The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed into law in 1993 by Congress, set an important new standard.</B> It requires that any law which imposes a &quot;substantial burden&quot; on someone's religious beliefs must serve a &quot;compelling&quot; government interest. If such a law is imposed, it must be carried out in the &quot;least intrusive&quot; way possible.  <BR> <B>...The case involves space problems at a church. </B>The city of Boerne, Texas, told St. Peter Catholic Church that it could not expand its 70-year-old building because it was located within the city's historic district. The church sued, saying it could not accomplish its mission unless it expanded. St. Peter church has more than 2,000 members, but its sanctuary can accommodate fewer than 250 at one time, news reports said. The city lost its case, and has appealed. <BR> <B>...Boerne officials contend that Congress overstepped its authority by passing RFRA.</B> They argue that RFRA violates the First Amendment by giving religion privileges that other expressions of conscience do not enjoy. Boerne officials also say RFRA violates the 10th Amendment rights of states and local governments by forcing them to allow more protection for religious beliefs than the Constitution requires. <BR> <B>...Sixteen states have joined in a friend-of-the-court brief against RFRA, </B>contending that it has allowed &quot;gangs and like-minded groups to shroud illicit activity under the cover of  religious belief.&quot; Many prison wardens also oppose RFRA, since it has resulted in lawsuits by inmates challenging various prison regulations as violations of their religious beliefs. The Justice Department has defended the law, as has a broad coalition of religious and civil rights groups. <BR> <B>...RFRA was enacted to overcome a 1990 Supreme Court decision</B> in an Oregon case involving Native Americans. The Supreme Court ruled that there is no constitutional right to take the drug peyote as a religious practice. It said laws that are otherwise neutral toward religion are not unconstitutional just because they may infringe on the religious beliefs of some people.    </font></p>

Christian college student wins lawsuit, refuses to subsidize
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A Christian college student who objected to his activity fee being used for liberal student clubs</B> has won a lawsuit against the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Scott Southworth and two other students at the University of Wisconsin Law School sued in federal court last spring. They object to the $6.50 per semester fee, which every student must pay, being used to subsidize groups whose political and ideological activities they do not like. On Nov. 29, District Court Judge John Shabaz ruled in favor of the students, saying the school's mandatory fee system is unconstitutional.  <BR> <B>...The decision potentially affects colleges across the country,</B> many of which have similar fee systems. Shabaz ruled that UW-Madison violated the students' First Amendment rights. In effect, he said, the fee forced the students to become involved in certain speech and association. The university's Board of Regents is expected to appeal the ruling. If the decision is finally upheld, fees already collected by the clubs may have to be refunded. <BR> <B>...Southworth said he particularly objects to four campus groups.</B> He cited the politically oriented Wisconsin Public Interest Group, which received $50,954 in student funding during the 1996-1997 school year, according to the<I> Badger Herald</I>, a campus newspaper. Also cited were the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Campus Center, which received $27,300; the Campus Women's Center (an abortion-rights group), which received $35,281; and the environmental policy group UW Greens, which received $7,100. <BR> <B>...&quot;It's a victory for the First Amendment and it's a victory for students</B> regardless of their political or ideological views,&quot; Southworth said. &quot;No students should have to pay for the political or ideological activities of any group on campus, no matter what they believe.&quot; His attorney, Jordan Lorence of Fairfax, Va., told the<I> Badger Herald</I> that the fee system has flagrantly violated First Amendment rights. &quot;I'm not surprised the judge's decision was so strong.&quot;   <BR> <B>...Many University of Wisconsin students and faculty strongly objected to the decision</B>. UW political scientist Donald Downs acknowledged that violations of a university no-politics rule have occurred, but said that doesn't mean the whole system should be discarded. Student groups that merely promulgate controversial ideas are not unconstitutional, he said. If that were the case, students who object to a professor's classroom comments could demand to be reimbursed for a portion of the professor's salary, he said. Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Madison) likened the student fee to income taxes. &quot;There are often places where those tax dollars go that we object to. And yet, opting out is not available for taxpayers. It urges people to participate in the democracy that allocates it,&quot; she said. <BR> <B>...The mandatory fee system nationwide puts &quot;millions of dollars into the hands of radicals,&quot;</B> according to Alan Sears, president of Alliance Defense Fund. The Christian legal group, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., helped fund Southworth's case. &quot;If we prevail, they will have to get their hands out of the wallets of students of faith and their families and either raise their money voluntarily like the rest of us or go out of business,&quot; Sears said. <BR> <B>...&quot;This issue is going to come up again because we are going to make it come up,&quot;</B> ADF attorney Scott Phillips told <I>Religion News Today</I>. A student at the University of Minnesota intends to file a lawsuit similar to Southworth's, Phillips said. The point these lawsuits is not to &quot;make these groups suffer, but to make them stand on their own,&quot; Phillips said. A definitive ruling for Southworth, particularly if it comes in the U.S. Supreme Court, would &quot;de-fund the forced speech of the left&quot; on college campuses, Phillips said.    </font></p>

Some Christmas shoppers reject materialism, give gifts to the poor</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>People concerned about the excessive materialism of the Christmas season are changing the way they shop. </B>Rather than giving the usual holiday gifts, some are donating money to medical relief for Rwandan orphans, dental exams for Cambodian children, goats for families in Mozambique, a night's shelter for a homeless person in the United States, or a host of other special causes. The gifts are purchased in the name of family or friends, who receive a card, ornament, or photograph and a description of the project being funded in their honor.  <BR> <B>...Alternative Gifts International, an interfaith, ecumenical agency, offers shares</B> in 24 programs and products that benefit the needy or help the environment. The program started in 1980 when Harriet Prichard, president and founder, held a small gift market at Pasadena Presbyterian Church, where she worked. Last year, churches, schools, and community groups held 239 such alternative gift markets in 36 states, helping support 18 nonprofit agencies. The phone number is 800-842-2243.  <BR> <B>...&quot;We help people give authentic, life-giving gifts rather than commercial gifts,&quot; </B>Prichard told <I>Religion News Today</I>. &quot;In this day and age when Americans are the most privileged people on earth, it is time for them to see the value of giving themselves away to the world,&quot; she said. <BR> <B>...World Concern, a nonprofit Christian relief organization</B>, has produced a <A HREF="http://www.worldconcern.org/giftcat.html-ssi">Global Gift Guide</a> for the past three years. The catalogue includes prenatal checkups for women in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Myanmar ($15), midwife kits for women in Cambodia and Uganda ($160), hot lunches for 50 preschool children in Ethiopia ($28.50), or two weeks of Bible camp for a Ukrainian orphan ($70). <BR> <B>...Christians say they want to spread peace on earth and goodwill toward men</B>, but &quot;those kinds of gifts aren't found in a shopping mall,&quot; said Christy Gardner, World Concern's communications director. Gifts to non-Christians lead to questions about the giver's values, creating opportunities for witnessing, Gardner told <I>Religion News Today</I>. World Concern's phone number is 800-755-5022. <BR> <B>...<A HREF="http://www.mlab.com/ads/habit01.stm">Habitat for Humanity</A> has an Extraordinary Gifts program</B> that increased 40% between 1993 and 1995, the group said. The program allows individuals to contribute to construction of homes for low-income individuals. It produced 9,084 gifts totaling $652,000 last year. Their phone number is 800-HABITAT, ext. 251. Heifer Project International, a nondenominational group, also offers a program of alternative gifts. They are at P.O. Box 808 in Little Rock, Ark., 72203. The phone number is (501) 376-6836.    </font></p>

Disease didn't disable evangelist's spirit</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>&quot;I have cerebral palsy -- what's your problem?&quot; David Ring says</B>. The evangelist likes to challenge his listeners -- some of whom may be depressed and feeling self-pity -- to compare their lives to his, and encourage them by what God can do. Ring, 42, was born with CP. His parents died when he was young, and David was moved from family to family. He recalls school classmates making fun of him and remembers thinking that everyone had given up on him because, &quot;I'm a no-good cripple.&quot; <BR> <B>...Until the day of his spiritual rebirth as a Christian, Ring had virtually no friends.</B> He isolated himself whenever he could, answering questions coldly in a monotone, and averting his eyes, according to <I>Just As I Am, The Life of David Ring</I> (Moody). &quot;If God loved me, why is God so angry with me? Why is God breaking my heart?&quot; Ring thought.  <BR> <B>...Ring has stopped considering himself a victim</B>, he says. He has not been healed of the disease and still &quot;walks and talks funny,&quot; he says. &quot;But oh! The joy that floods my soul because Jesus made me whole.&quot; Speaking haltingly but clearly, Ring causes audiences to realize that all things are possible through Christ. &quot;I can't even say Jesus plain. What's your problem, healthy man, women, teen-ager?&quot; he asks. <BR> <B>...Ring tells his story to about 100,000 people a year at churches, conventions, schools</B> and corporate events and has been featured on several nationally televised programs. He and his wife, Karen, have four children and live in Orlando, Fla.    </font></p>

U.S. Congress, states consider restrictions on abortion</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Tens of thousands of pro-life demonstrators marched to the Capitol and the Supreme Court today</B> during the annual March for Life.  The line of marchers on Constitution Avenue stretched for 15 blocks, but it was smaller than in previous years, according to United Press International.  Last year, organizers said 75,000 people participated. <BR> <B>...Twenty-four years after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion </B>in the Roe vs. Wade case, an anti-abortion mood is prevalent in Congress and a number of state legislatures.  The court's 1992 ruling allowing states to limit abortions has resulted in restrictive laws in several states.  Three states have passed laws banning partial-birth abortion, and efforts are under way in 26 more states to enact such bans, according to the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.  (During the partial-birth technique, the fetus is delivered feet first until just the head remains in the birth canal.  Then the brains are suctioned out and the skull collapsed.) <BR> <B>...Three-quarters of the nation's state legislative bodies support restrictions</B> <B>on abortion,</B> according to NARAL.  These include provisions for parental consent, husband consent or notification, waiting periods, or informed-consent rules that require women to receive materials on fetal development and adoption.  <BR> <B>...At the U.S. Capitol, the 1996 elections resulted in anti-abortion majorities in both houses.  </B>Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has made it a top priority to ban partial-birth abortions.  In a published report, he characterized President Clinton's veto of a bill last year that would have banned the procedure as &quot;a shameless act.&quot; Lott said Clinton has shown a recent willingness to discuss the bill. <BR> <B>...The Roe vs. Wade anniversary elicits emotions for people on both sides of the issue</B>.  This year, the date was preceded by bombings at abortion clinics in Atlanta last Tuesday and Tulsa, Okla., on Saturday.  NARAL was holding a luncheon in Washington today, and the President, Mrs. Clinton, the Vice President, and Mrs. Gore were expected to attend. <BR> <B>...A Catholic Mass and prayer vigil were held Tuesday at the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception</B> in Washington, D.C., the largest U.S. Catholic church.  In a sermon there, Detroit Cardinal Adam Maida called for &quot;righteous anger&quot; against abortion, but also urged &quot;respect and patience&quot; for all people. <BR> <B>...Randall Terry mocked what he considers the Republican Party's compromises</B> on the abortion issue.  The founder of Operation Rescue spoke at Hylton Chapel in Woodbridge, Va., during the third annual National Memorial for the Pre-born and Their Mothers and Fathers.  Other speakers included radio talk-show host Alan Keyes; Norma McCorvey, who was &quot;Roe&quot; in the Roe vs. Wade decision; U.S. Taxpayers Party presidential candidate Howard Phillips; and several government, pro-life, and religious leaders.    </font></p>

Christians praying as they stroll</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR>  <B>&quot;Prayerwalking&quot; is growing in popularity as a method  for Christians to evangelize their neighbors.  </B>The term refers  to strolling two-by-two while praying for people in neighborhoods,  schools, or work places.  <BR>  <B>....Prayerwalking is low-profile, such as praying quietly for  neighbors </B>while passing their houses during a morning walk.   It is &quot;being on the scene without making a scene,&quot;  said Steve Hawthorne, head of WayMakers, an Austin, Texas, ministry  that serves local movements of united prayer.  <BR>  <B>...Members of a church sometimes walk together.  </B>Prayerwalking  groups often begin by gathering for a one-day effort, then expand  their plans to include larger portions of the city.  When members  of several churches walk together, they often develop a sense  of common purpose in evangelizing the city.  <BR>  <B>...Networks of prayerwalkers are forming nationally.  </B>The  group PrayerWalk USA helps individuals map out whole cities for  prayer.  Its goal is that the people in every home in the country  are prayed for at least once by the year 2000.  Eventually, the  group wants to organize enough prayerwalkers to pray for people  in every home every day.  <BR>  <B>...Prayerwalkers in the United Kingdom have begun Operation  A to Z, </B>an effort to cover every home in their nation by the  year 2000.  They leave a leaflet on each door that explains they<B>  </B>are Christians who are praying for them.  Ten percent of the  United Kingdom has been covered so far, according to the group.   In Singapore, hundreds of Christians gather for one day in August  each year for a prayerwalk.    <BR>  <B>...In Chicago, Christians from hundreds of churches participated  in Prayerwalk Sunday</B> last April 21 prior to evangelist Luis  Palau's crusade.  The Jesus Video Project, which is attempting  to distribute the film to every house in the United States, recommends  prayerwalking before distribution of the videos.  <BR>  <B>...Other prayer walkers travel far from home.  </B>So-called  prayer journeys involve people who travel to another city to prayerwalk.   Prayer expeditions involve prayerwalkers intentionally following  certain routes. One example was last year's prayerwalk retracing  Gen. William Sherman's path of destruction during the Civil War.            </font></p>

Chaplains are ministering in the workplace </H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>An increasing number of businesses are employing chaplains</B> to help workers with their personal problems. Nearly all of the chaplains, who work in an estimated 4,000 companies in the United States, are ordained Christian ministers. <BR> <B>...Workplace chaplains get to know employees as they chat during coffee breaks. </B>Employees then may want to meet with the chaplain privately in the chaplain's office outside company property. There the employee can more freely discuss anxieties about family matters, drugs, workplace tensions, and fears. The chaplains also make hospital visits and sympathy calls on dying retirees, and sometimes get involved in mediation of workplace disputes.  <BR> <B>...&quot;There's a great need for soul-care in the workplace,&quot; </B>Gil Stricklin, who founded the Marketplace Ministries in 1984, told <I>Religion News Today</I>. The nonprofit ministry, based in Dallas, sends out 325 chaplains, all of whom are Protestant evangelicals from 28 denominations. <BR> <B>...The workplace is one of the most deadly places in the country</B>, Stricklin said. Last year, 700 people were murdered on the job, many when a former employee returned to kill a supervisor.  <BR> <B>...Half of the workers in the United States don't have a pastor, </B>and many of those who do, don't want to confide in him, Stricklin said. For church-goers involved in moral problems, &quot;usually<B> </B>the last person they want to know about it is the pastor.&quot; Chaplains employed by Marketplace Ministries introduce about 170 people a month to Christ, Stricklin said. <BR> <B>...Chaplaincy is most common in offices such as banks and car dealerships,</B> where stress is high, Stricklin said. Manufacturers also employ chaplains. The United Auto Workers has five full-time ministers and 300 volunteers at GM, Ford, and Chrysler plants.  <BR> <B>...Last fall, Dallas Theological Seminary, </B>which trains ministers for Protestant denominations, began the nation's first major accredited Master's degree program for workplace chaplains. Still, the need far outstrips the number of available chaplains, said Stricklin, whose organization has doubled in size in the last three years. &quot;There's a lot of pain, hurt, and sadness out there.&quot;    </font></p>

U.S. military censors sermons</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>...The gag order was prompted by the Roman Catholic Church's pro-life postcard campaign, </B>which aimed to persuade Congress to override President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion act. In an attempt to head off the campaign within the military, officers issued memoranda setting limits for speech and political activities. Their memos cited the pro-life campaign as an example of forbidden activity, the<I> Christian Science Monitor</I> said. At the same time, Catholic priests were being told by their bishops to preach about the campaign. <BR> <B>...Caught between two masters, Catholic chaplain Vincent Rigdon sued the government</B>. Rigdon, an Air Force Reserve lieutenant colonel, said the military's order infringes on his constitutional right to free exercise of religion. &quot;The supreme master is God,&quot; Rigdon told the <I>National Catholic Reporter, </I>noting that he would resign if he ever encountered a conflict that he could not resolve legally.  <BR> <B>...An Air Force rabbi, the Muslim Military Association, and a Catholic officer</B> from the U.S. Naval Academy have joined Rigdon in the suit, which is scheduled to be heard in Washington federal district court in November. <BR> <B>...The Pentagon insists its chaplains are not being denied free speech.</B> Chaplains may discuss the morality of current issues, but not influence pending legislation, Pentagon officials said. They also may get involved in politics when out of uniform.  <BR> <B>...The right of service members to have chaplains has been upheld in court</B>. In 1985, the Second Court of Appeals in New York ruled that without them, it would be impossible for service members to have religious mentoring, thus violating their constitutional right to free exercise of religion. But some observers say a government-funded chaplaincy creates inherent conflicts of interest, and should be re-examined.    </font></p>

African-Americans starting Christian schools</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A growing number of African-American parents are rejecting public schools</B> and instead sending their children to small, Christian day schools started by black churches.  The schools began organizing in the 1980s, and there now are 200-300 across the country, according to Jack Layman of Columbia International University in Columbia, S.C.  The schools meet in buildings that range from modern facilities to abandoned restaurants. <BR> <B>...Many of the schools are theologically conservative, </B>reflecting the desire of parents to have their children learn traditional Christian values.  Parents say the public schools are weak academically and objectionable spiritually.  They want a school that offers a family environment, individual attention, good academics, and prayer. <BR> <B>...The schools often begin to operate with a few students </B>and grade levels, growing a year at a time.  Children use A Beka books or some other Christian curriculum, and are taught subjects such as science and geography from a Christian perspective.  Students take Bible classes, black history, and attend chapel. <BR> <B>...The development of black Christian schools </B>parallels the growth of white Christian day schools in the 1960s and 1970s.  It is ironic that some African-Americans, who have been outspoken in their support for public schools, are now among their harshest critics, said James Carper, an education professor at the University of South Carolina.   <BR> <B>...Protestant Christian schools comprise about half</B> of the new black institutions.  Black enrollment also is up in Muslim schools, Catholic schools, and at independent secular schools created by blacks.    </font></p>

Missionaries see hatred, hope in Rwanda</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>...The missionaries divided into nine groups and visited Rwanda's eight Episcopal dioceses</B>. At one sanctuary, Rwandans described how Anglicans, Roman Catholics, Baptists, and Pentecostals from both tribes had tried to take refuge from the killing. When militias ordered the crowd to separate by tribes, the people refused, declaring themselves all &quot;one in Christ,&quot; ENS said. All 13,500 were murdered and buried together in five mass graves, the missionaries were told. <BR> <B>...In another town, the missionaries visited a school where rooms were filled with 40,000 skeletons</B>, many with hair or clothing attached, ENS said. Those reluctant to participate in the killings were given the choice of  joining the executioners or  the victims. The skeletons were exhumed and displayed to show  what had happened. <BR> <B>...Many women described losing their entire families, </B>telling how their children were betrayed by their teachers or killed by neighbors they had known for a lifetime.  <BR> <B>...Some of those responsible for the deaths begged for forgiveness.</B>  The missionaries arranged for clergy and lay people from different tribes to share a meal and the Eucharist together for the first time since the killings. The services included spontaneous outpourings of grief and pain as enemies embraced and wept.  <BR> <B>...Whether the Rwandan church can renew itself  remains uncertain</B>, the missionaries said. Many church leaders were forced from the country and have not returned or have been charged with indifference or complicity in the slaughter. Divisions among church factions are deep, sometimes to the point of estrangement or, in one cathedral, open disruption during worship.    </font></p>

Property-tax exemptions for nonprofit groups threatened</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on whether governments can remove a property-tax exemption</B> <B>from a nonprofit group</B> if most of the people it serves are not state residents. The case is a tax dispute between a Christian Science summer camp and the town of Harrison, Maine. Camp Newfound/Owatonna is appealing its $22,000-a-year property tax bill from the town and challenging a 39-year-old law as an unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce. About 95% of its campers are from outside Maine. Under current law, the camp would pay no property tax if most of its campers were from Maine. <BR> <B>...In the past, the Supreme Court has interpreted the U.S. Constitution's commerce clause as barring state economic protectionism</B>. This would seem to support the camp's challenge, <I>The New York Times</I> said. But Maine's Supreme Judicial Court upheld the law last year. That ruling alarmed nonprofit organizations around the country. <BR> <B>...Nonprofit groups have warned</B> that if other states took the same approach, many organizations that served an out-of-state population, such as colleges, could be liable for taxes on valuable real estate.  <BR> <B>...Meanwhile in Colorado, a voter referendum on the ballot </B>next month would, for the first time, require most charitable, religious, and nonprofit social-service organizations in the state to pay property taxes. The referendum is sponsored by talk-show host John Murphy, who says &quot;God is not broke&quot; but that Colorado cities are. If Amendment 11 passes, some ministries in Colorado say they will be forced to close. Orphanages, public schools, homeless shelters, housing for the elderly and disabled, and hospices would remain exempt.    </font></p>

Spiritual renewal catching fire in Philadelphia</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A spiritual renewal is taking place in Philadelphia</B>. It began in July 1994, when pastors and other leaders from several inner-city and suburban congregations, calling themselves A Circle of Friends, began holding monthly services. In December 1995, Randy Clark, pastor of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship of  St. Louis, and his worship team led five nights of services at Deliverance Evangelistic Church, a predominantly African-American congregation. Clark, who travels internationally, is associated with the Toronto Blessing movement that began in 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard in Canada. <BR> <B>...At the Philadelphia services, Christians of  many denominational and racial backgrounds worshipped together</B>. Repentance between races, healing of the sick in body and spirit, and an infusion of  joy and &quot;holy laughter&quot; characterized the meetings, which lasted into the early hours of the morning, participants said. <BR> <B>...Since then, Philadelphia's monthly renewal services have grown in size and scope.</B> More than 2,000 people from throughout the Delaware Valley attend. In addition, an interdenominational group of pastors from the inner-city and suburbs meet regularly to pray and fast for further renewal.  <BR> <B>...Clark and his music team returned to Deliverance Evangelistic Church Oct. 7-- this time for 30 days</B> of meetings. Leaders intend the services to be filled with worship, teaching, healing of the sick, and salvation of the lost, they said. Opportunities to serve the inner-city through witnessing and feeding the hungry also are planned. The meetings were preceded by a two-day seminar hosted by pastors and other leaders from suburban and inner-city churches. Seminar leaders included pastors Pablo Boltari, Carlos Mraida, and Pablo Deires of Argentina, who are involved in a spiritual awakening in that country. <BR> <B>...Clark said in a letter to the church prior to the meetings that there have been only three occasions</B> where he has had a sense that &quot;God was going to move in a certain geographical area.&quot; The first was in Toronto, Canada, in January 1994; the second was when going to Melbourne, Fla., in January 1995; &quot;and the third is my upcoming meetings in Philadelphia,&quot; he wrote. Deliverance Evangelistic Church is located at 2001 W. Lehigh Ave. in Philadelphia.    </font></p>

Hospital patients, priests slaughtered in Zaire</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Marauding Tutsis massacred 38 people in a Swedish missionary hospital in Zaire, Africa, Oct. 6, </B>news reports said. Most victims were shot or bayoneted while in their beds. The murders took place in Lemera, eastern Zaire, near the borders of  Rwanda and Burundi. <BR> <B>...Tutsis also slaughtered 12 people, including two priests, at a nearby Catholic mission,</B> said Dag Bohlin, a spokesman for the Swedish Free Pentecostal Church, which runs the hospital. As they were leaving, the marauders took hostages, including a staff member of  the British group The Leprosy Mission International. They also stole medicine, burned trucks, and destroyed part of the hospital, TLMI said. <BR> <B>...Those involved in the raids are part of a Tutsi subgroup known as the Banyamulenge</B>. Although they have lived in Zaire for up to 200 years -- arriving from what are now Rwanda and Burundi -- the Banyamulenga are a people without a country since their citizenship was revoked in 1981. Zairian authorities want to concentrate the Banyamulenge in government-controlled camps to make them easier to monitor. <BR> <B>...Tensions have been building in the region for months</B>. The situation grew even more explosive recently when Zaire gave 200,000 Banyamulenge an ultimatum: leave the area by Oct. 15 or be hunted down as rebels by Zairian soldiers. <BR> <B>...Zairian troops and large crowds set up roadblocks in Bukavu</B> Oct. 11 and looked for Banyamulenga. &quot;A general witch-hunt&quot; was taking place as suspected Banyamulenge were being dragged off by police, Reuters said. United Nations agencies tried to evacuate foreign staff from Bukavu and Uvira to the south. The TLMI said one staff member at Lemera, who is of Tutsi origin, &quot;fled into the mountains.&quot; Other TLMI missionaries also were evacuated.    </font></p>

Slave-labor camps still exist in China</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>China operates a brutal system of slave-labor factories largely unknown to the West</B>, according to a prominent Chinese-born dissident. Harry Wu survived 19 years in the <I>laogoi</I> -- or reform-through-labor-camps -- where he was tortured and nearly died. Now as an American citizen, Wu, 59, is on a crusade to speak for those still imprisoned who are &quot;faceless, nameless, and voiceless.&quot;   <BR> <B>...&quot;Why don't you know about the <I>laogoi</I>?&quot; </B>Wu challenged his audience during a speech in Roanoke, Va., on Monday. &quot;Everything you saw in (the Nazi concentration camp movie) <I>Schindler's List</I> is happening in China today,&quot; he said. In the<I> laogoi</I>, prisoners become like animals, he said. &quot;If you treat yourself as a beast, you can survive. A beast only looks for food -- it doesn't care about ethics.&quot;  <BR> <B>...Wu made headlines internationally last year when he was arrested for espionage </B>in China while attempting to film the dealings of international merchants who sell slave-labor products. The arrest of Wu -- who was already known from a <I>60 Minutes</I> program that documented his 1991 covert trip to China -- drew an outcry in the United States. After a joint resolutions from Congress on his behalf, Wu was released.  <BR> <B>...In Wu's passionate speeches to legislative bodies and civic groups around the world, </B>he shows film footage of mass executions of Chinese prisoners. Such events, also documented by groups such as Amnesty International, take place regularly before crowds of thousands of people, Wu says. Their purpose is to instill fear of the communist leaders, whose grasp on power is slipping, Wu says. <BR> <B>...Body organs of executed prisoners are the source of  90% of the transplants in China,</B> Wu said. Some foreigners also travel to China to receive organs they cannot get elsewhere. Body parts sometimes are eaten, according to Wu, who said he has seen a man shot and watched the executioners eat the brain.   <BR> <B>...In addition to eliminating political and religious dissenters, the <I>laogoi</I> serves an economic purpose</B>, Wu said. The communist government uses income from goods produced in the prisons to fuel the economy and increase its military strength. Some missiles are sold to other dictatorships. Wu harshly criticizes Western businesses for their economic relations with the Chinese regime.      <BR> <B>...Religious freedom and other human rights in China are largely illusory, </B>a facade to attract investment money from the West, Wu said. China's official churches are controlled by the state and operate under strict guidelines. An illegal house-church movement is flourishing, but those involved are subject to harassment, arrest, and torture. Estimates of the number of Christians in China range from 15 million to 80 million. Between 50% and 80% of them belong to unregistered churches. <BR> <B>...Some prisoners are Christians arrested for their faith</B>, Wu said. In the 1950s, Chinese communists decimated church buildings, expelled foreign missionaries, and imprisoned Catholic and Protestant leaders. While in prison, Wu, who is Catholic, spoke to a priest who had been imprisoned 35 years. The priest had been forced to live in a four-foot-square room -- with a foot of water on the floor -- after he was betrayed by other prisoners who saw him praying.  <BR> <B>...Change is inevitable in China</B>, Wu says. &quot;We once believed that communism was our heaven,&quot; and that is why very few people complained. But the socialist production system has failed to deliver on its promises. Now, &quot;those at the top no longer are able to rule the old way, and those at the bottom do not accept being ruled the old way.&quot; <BR> <B>...Until change comes, Wu says he will continue his crusade. </B>He has 100 hours of film footage and 1,000 photographs, taken inside China, that he plans to make into a film. Wu also says he will return again covertly with a camera to his homeland. &quot;They troubled me too much. This is my chance to trouble them,&quot; he said.     </font></p>

Birth of &quot;miracle baby&quot; leads to powerful witness
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The healing of a guard's baby helped lead 21 inmates to salvation at Rhode Island's Juvenile Detention Center</B>. According to <I>Currents</I>, a newsletter published by The Evangelistic Association of New England, doctors told the guard that, according to their tests, the baby he and his wife were expecting would be born with deformities or Down syndrome. They recommended a third-trimester abortion. <BR> <B>...The guard shared his anguish with Mike Kropman,</B> an EANE ministry prison-coordinator who was visiting the center to hold a Bible study. Kropman talked about God's faithfulness when there appears to be no hope, and invited the guard to bring his wife to their church for prayer. The guard, who is Catholic, was hesitant, but agreed. At the end of the service, the guard and his wife came forward for prayer. Kropman and the elders prayed for the baby's healing and anointed the couple with oil. <BR> <B>...With their faith renewed, the couple made the decision to have the baby rather than undergo an abortion</B>. &quot;We are going to trust God,&quot; she said.

&quot;Experiencing God&quot; Bible study making an imact around
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A personal and small-group Bible study called <I>Experiencing God</I> is having an extraordinary impact around the world.</B> The 12-week, workbook-style study is published by Broadman &amp; Holman, an arm of the Southern Baptist Convention.  <BR> <B>...A total of 1.8 million copies of <I>Experiencing God</I> have been sold </B>since publication began in 1990; it currently is selling at a rate of 40,000-45,000 a month. Versions also have been developed for teen-agers and younger children. The study has been translated into 31 languages. <BR> <B>...In addition, the study has been condensed into 60 fifteen-minute segments and is being aired on Trans World Radio</B> in Russia, China, and several Arabic countries. Plans are under way to broadcast <I>Experiencing God</I> in all of South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.  <BR> <B>...An ongoing study of <I>Experiencing God</I> is occurring on the Internet. </B>Those interested can join the study by sending email to hub@xc.org with the message &quot;subscribe expgod.&quot; The next 12-week session begins in January.  <B> </B> <BR> <B>...The study has become &quot;a common denominator, bringing a lot of believers back to the basics of faith,&quot; </B>according to Sam House, coordinator of the <I>Experiencing God</I> project for the Southern Baptist Convention. The study, written by Southern Baptist leader Henry Blackaby and author Claude King, is being used by pastors and laypersons from many denominations, including Pentecostal and charismatic groups, House said.  <BR> <B>&#133;<I>Experiencing God</I> emphasizes praying for God's direction,</B> waiting to hear Him speak, and expecting Him to do extraordinary things. Participants are taught that God is always at work around them, leading believers to make major adjustments in their lives. <BR> <B>...&quot;Our world is not attracted to the Christ we serve, because they cannot see Him at work,&quot;</B> the study says. &quot;When the world sees things happening through God's people that cannot be explained except that God Himself has done them, then the world will be drawn to the God they see.&quot; <BR> <B>...Much of the course is a change of perspective from the typical &quot;American Christian mindset,&quot;</B> House said. Many Christians simply look for something else they can do for God than to follow God's leading, House said. <BR> <B>...Author Blackaby and his wife Marilynn lead couples' conferences</B> centered around <I>Experiencing God</I> several times a year. A conference this month at the Ridgecrest conference center in Asheville, N.C., drew 1,900 couples. Conferences next year are planned in Baton Rouge, La., Ontario, Calif., Dallas, and Ridgecrest. Blackaby also leads Fresh Encounter conferences, which explain how congregations can prepare themselves for spiritual renewal.  <BR>   <BR>       </font></p>

Home schooling movement still growing, but faces opposition
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Home schooling has made several legal strides over the past decade.</B> It has become lawful in all 50 states to teach children at home rather than in a formal school. And last summer, Michigan became the last state to concede that parents have a right to teach their children without state certification. <BR> <B>...But the movement continues to face strong opposition</B> from some school officials and the National Education Association. In a number of states, the 2.2 million-member teachers' union has supported legislation that increases regulations on home schooling. The NEA has stuck by its 1988 resolution, which says home schooling &quot;cannot provide the student with a comprehensive education experience.&quot; The 900,000-member American Federation of Teachers has not commented on the subject.  <BR> <B>...Clashes between home-schooling parents and government school agents are increasing in some areas</B>, according to the Home School Legal Defense Association, a Virginia-based advocacy group. Since home schooling is legal, the battle now is for the right to be free from certain regulations<B>,</B> according to HSLDA attorney Christopher Klicka. HSLDA spends much of its time &quot;keeping social workers out&quot; of the residences of home schoolers, he told <I>The Washington Times</I>. <BR> <B>...Other public school systems are more tolerant of home schooling</B>, and are giving home-schooled children access to public school facilities and activities. Some Christian schools also offer home schoolers access. In addition, home schooling families often network with each other or get together for special classes and organized sports. <BR> <B>...The number of children being taught at home continues to increase.</B> The HSLDA estimates that home schooling has grown 25% annually for the last several years and now includes between 900,000 and 1.2 million children. The U.S. Department of Education cites the number at 600,000, but acknowledges that is probably a low estimate. Observers say it is impossible to know the exact number since few records are kept and many home-schooling families don't report to local school districts. <BR> <B>...Many more families have begun home schooling for non-religious reasons in recent years</B>. In a Florida State Department of Education survey of home schoolers last year, 61% cited dissatisfaction with the public schools' environment and instruction as their reason for home schooling. About 21% cited religious reasons.  <BR> <B>...Most colleges accept home-schooled students without a transcript, </B>a change from a decade ago. U.S. Department of Education researcher Patricia Lines said she found no college last year that rejected a student because of lack of a transcript, <I>The Washington Times</I> reported.     </font></p>

&quot;Where are the righteous?&quot; leader asks at prayer-and-fasting

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>About 4,000 Christians gathered to fast and pray Nov. 14-16 in St. Louis </B>while thousands more participated at 141 satellite sites in churches, military bases, college campuses, and homes nationwide. Fasting &amp; Prayer '96 also was broadcast in two, one-hour specials on 133 television stations in the United States; the potential audience was 32 million households. <BR> <B>...&quot;There is a growing desperation in this nation today. Sin is rampant,&quot; </B>said Paul Cedar, chief executive officer of Mission America, the sponsor of the event. &quot;Where are the righteous? We have come to cry out to God. It is only by His mercy that this nation has not been consumed. America is in desperate need today of what only God can give.&quot; <BR> <B>...Other speakers included Tom Elliff, president of the Southern Baptist Convention</B>; Shirley Dobson, chairperson the National Day of Prayer; Bill McCartney, founder of Promise Keepers; Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network; and Adrian Rogers, pastor of Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis, Tenn.  <BR> <B>...The United States is &quot;experiencing what other nations have experienced</B> when they turned their backs on God,&quot; said Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright, who co-chaired the event with his wife, Vonette. &quot;The goal here is to say, Lord, we have sinned against you, and we ask you to forgive us and heal our land.&quot; <BR> <B>...The prayer-and-fasting gathering focused on confession and forgiveness</B> and on praying for government leaders, the church, the family, the Great Commission, the media, athletes, and personal spiritual growth, Baptist Press said.  <BR> <B>...&quot;Weep for the church as Christ wept over Jerusalem,&quot;</B> Elliff said. &quot;Christ loved the church and gave Himself for the church so that we might present a glorious, holy church to God without blemish. But we are not without blemish.&quot; Christians have victimized themselves by preaching a &quot;synthetic gospel&quot; that looks like the real thing, but lacks &quot;Holy Spirit conviction, true repentance, genuine faith, lordship, and a changed life.&quot;  <BR> <B>...Planners hope to make the gathering an annual occurrence. </B>It originated two years ago when 600 Christian leaders fasted and prayed in Orlando, Fla.      </font></p>

It won't be another Million Man March, organizers say</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A planned rally marking the one-year anniversary of the Million Man March has attracted little attention</B>. Organizers of  the World Day of Atonement, to be held at the United Nations in New York on Oct. 16, expect fewer than 50,000 participants. <BR> <B>...Organizers say they aren't attempting to repeat the Million Man March. </B>&quot;We are celebrating a holy day. What happened last year was a spiritual event,&quot; Benjamin Chavis, former executive director of the NAACP, told the Associated Press. In addition to Chavis, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan again is helping organize the rally and will be its main speaker, issuing a worldwide appeal to end &quot;injustice, exploitation, violence, and war.&quot; <BR> <B>...Many black leaders aren't participating this year.  </B>Those not coming include Jesse Jackson, who spoke at the Million Man March; NAACP President Kweisi Mfume; National Urban League President Hugh Price; and Southern Christian Leadership Conference President Joseph Lowery, news reports said. Some leaders cite disillusionment with the organizers. <BR> <B>...The Million Man March raised expectations of a lofty crusade to tackle social problems</B>. Little of that has happened. Also, a promised political force has not emerged from the rally, said Ron Daniels, director of the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York.   <BR> <B>...But the legacy of the march also is spiritual, and is still unfolding</B>, others say. One purpose was to increase the sense of personal responsibility among African Americans, encouraging them to revitalize their neighborhoods and improve their families.  <BR> <B>...Many of the marchers have translated its lessons into personal terms.</B> Some say the march has kept their families intact and brought them into churches. Local men's groups have formed; some of the groups have fizzled, but others have organized campaigns and made progress in solving neighborhood ills. Many community leaders agree that today, social progress will come about more by individual efforts than large-scale actions, <I>The Chicago Tribune</I> said.    </font></p>

Tragedy of immense proportions worsens in Central Africa</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The huge scale of the tragedy in central Africa became increasingly clear Friday</B> as the international community desperately tried to find a way to get 1 million stranded Rwandan Hutu refugees back home from Zaire. Thousands of the refugees -- who are cut off from the outside world by a complex war in eastern Zaire -- were dying of hunger, thirst, and poisonous gases on lava fields. Western aid organizations warned that hundreds of thousands of people would die before help arrived.   <BR> <B>...The situation is a stalemate</B>. Tutsi-led Rwanda wants the innocent, civilian Hutus to come home; they comprise 95% of the refugees. But 5% of the refugees are Rwandan Hutu militiamen who fled their homeland in 1994 after killing 800,000 Tutsis. They refuse to go home, where they would face the wrath of the Tutsis who survived. The militiamen, who are still armed, are rampaging through eastern Zaire looting camps and villages. They also are guarding what is left of the refugee camps and have denied access to outsiders. Meanwhile, Zaire, tired of its destabilizing refugee burden, wants the Hutus out and will not allow aid workers to feed them. <BR> <B>...&quot;Soldiers and wrong ones are the ones most likely to survive</B>. The innocent women, children and the old are first to die,&quot; Fernando Rodriguez of Doctors of the World told Reuters. Many refugees are hiding in the jungle,<B> </B>according to an aid worker for Action for Churches Together. He flew a plane over the crowds, who were robbing each other. Food riots were occurring in the rebel-held eastern Zaire city of Goma on Friday. Rebels fired into the air to beat back 1,000 hungry people fighting for the last food in a U.N. warehouse.   <BR> <B>...In addition to the Rwandan Hutu refugees, many others are roaming over eastern Zaire. </B>They include demoralized soldiers from Zaire's ragged army, stranded in a growing rebellion against President Mobutu Ssese Seko. Zairian soldiers fired into the air and stole equipment from Mission Aviation Fellowship on Thursday, according to Herman van Heuvelen, MAF's operation manager in Uganda. Also, three Spanish priests were killed Thursday in the eastern Zairean city of Bukavu, Reuters reported. A number of Spanish priests, nuns, missionaries, and air workers remained in Zaire, unable or unwilling to leave the country. A worker from the British group Christian Aid who flew over the area said he saw semi-deserted villages and normally busy roads that now are empty. <BR> <B>...Aid agencies say they have all the supplies needed to save the refugees -- but no way to get to them.</B> No huge aid airlift is needed as it was in 1994, when Rwanda's genocide caused a mass exodus. After wars in Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Burundi, East Africa has a massive aid structure, with much of the food stockpiled in neighboring countries such as Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. <BR> <B>...The latest proposal was to create an international military force to protect the corridors</B> through which the refugees could be safely repatriated. Rwanda told the United Nations that it opposed any army contingent from France, the main advocate for military intervention. Any such force must be neutral, said Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimunga.      </font></p>

New book documents missionary heroes</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Twelve American Protestant missionaries risked their lives to rescue thousands of innocent Chinese</B> citizens during the winter of 1937, when the invading Japanese army overran the Nationalist Chinese capital of Nanjing, recently discovered and publicized documents show. <BR> <B>...The missionaries, along with four German citizens and several Russians,</B> established a safety zone for 200,000 Chinese while Japanese soldiers carried out a two-month rampage of looting, rape, and killing that left tens of thousands dead. The Japanese army killed 300,000 Chinese and raped 80,000 women in the city, according to the forthcoming book <I>American Missionary Witness to the Nanjing Massacre</I>. It contains eyewitness accounts from diaries left by nine of the missionaries, providing &quot;massive, irrevocable testimonies&quot; of the events. The facts also have been corroborated by numerous Chinese victims, the book says. <BR> <B>...Yet Japan has consistently denied that the massacre occurred. </B>As recently as last week, a Japanese government official was quoted in a <I>New York Times</I> advertisement disputing the atrocities. Some former Japanese Imperial Army soldiers, Japanese Embassy personnel, and scores of Japanese journalists living today saw the massacre but have refused to talk about it, <I>American Missionary Witness </I>says<I>.</I> <BR> <B>...The massacre is &quot;one of the greatest horrors in the annals of mankind&quot;</B> and has come to be known as the Rape of Nanjing, the book says. The manner in which the victims died was extremely cruel, including beheading, bayoneting, burying alive, burning, and gang-raping, according to the book.<B> </B>The missionaries whose accounts are reprinted in the book include: Miner Searle Bates, John G. Magee, George A. Fitch, Lewis S.C. Smythe, W. Plumer Mills, Robert O. Wilson, Ernest H. Forster, James H. McCallum, and Minnie Vautrin. Their diaries are housed in the Yale Divinity School Library. <BR> <B>...When Nanjing fell, 27 Westerners remained in the city, </B>according to the accounts. Fifteen of them were Americans, including the missionaries, who were from Episcopal, Disciples of Christ, Presbyterian, and Methodist denominations. The Americans chose to stay against the advice of the U.S. Embassy. <BR> <B>...Shortly before the city's capture, the Westerners set up an area of sanctuary</B> they called the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone. It became the only place in Nanjing offering any refuge from the slaughter. Some 200,000 people crowded into the zone, an area about one-eighth the size of the city. During the massacre, which lasted from December 1937 to February 1938, &quot;these few foreigners were the true protectors of the desperate Chinese,&quot; the book says. <BR> <B>...The recently discovered 1,200-page diary of John Rabe, </B>one of the<B> </B>German citizens and a Nazi loyalist, provides his account of the atrocities. Rabe describes digging foxholes in his backyard to shelter 650 Chinese, and repelling Japanese troops who tried to climb over the wall. He also tells of running through the city delivering food and stopping Japanese soldiers from raping Chinese women. His humanitarian actions have been compared to those of Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist who protected Jews. <BR> <B>...Although press attention has focused on Rabe and his diary, </B>the missionaries were just as involved in the heroism, according to Martha Smalley, curator of the Day Missions Collection at the Yale Divinity School Library, which holds the missionary diaries. The missionaries were in &quot;tremendous danger&quot; as they tried to prevent people from getting killed or raped and provided food for the refugees, Smalley told <I>Religion News Today</I>.  <BR> <B>...The Westerners stayed in the sanctuary zone</B> <B>with the refugees, </B>sometimes shouting down Japanese soldiers about to rape women and reporting various incidents to the Japanese Embassy. &quot;It is almost impossible to write what has happened, but I never dreamed that such human beasts existed as we have had to deal with,&quot; Episcopal missionary Forster wrote in a letter to his wife. The soldiers took Chinese men away in droves, executed them, then &quot;looted and raped to their heart's content,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I usually spend the day taking women and wounded civilians to the hospital&quot; and guarding the two residences where &quot;most of our Christians and many others, particularly girls, are taking refuge. Our presence there helps to keep soldiers out.&quot;  <BR> <B>...&quot;I came as near to being shot as I ever hope to be,&quot;</B> wrote Robert Wilson, a Methodist medical doctor at the University of Nanjing Hospital. When he learned a Japanese solder was inside the girls' dormitory at the hospital, &quot;I barged in and ordered him out in no uncertain terms.&quot; The soldier menacingly loaded several cartridges into his rifle, but did not fire.    </font></p>

School Bible clubs can require some officers to be Christians
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>High school Bible clubs can require their policy-making officers be Christians, </B>the U.S. Supreme Court ruled today. But the court also held that some club officers do not have to be Christians. <BR> <B>...The case started in 1993, when Emily Hsu and her brother Timothy</B>, students at Roslyn High School on Long Island, N.Y., tried to start an after-school Bible study on school grounds. The Roslyn Free School District approved the club, but rejected its proposed constitution, which required all club officers to be Christians. School officials told the Hsus that would violate the district's requirement that clubs be open to all students regardless of their religious beliefs. <BR> <B>...The Hsus sued, claiming their religious freedom was being violated</B>. A federal judge ruled for the school district. But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, ordering the school district to exempt the Bible club from its policy. The appeals court said the requirement of Christian officers is a form of free expression intended &quot;to guarantee that meetings include the desired worship and observance.&quot; The court noted that the officers had to be Christians because part of their duties was leading the club in prayer. <BR> <B>...The case sends a signal to schools that government should stay out</B> of the business of  religious organizations, according to the American Center for Law and Justice, which filed the 1994 suit on behalf of the Hsus.   <BR> <B>...But the ruling may be a mixture of good and bad news, </B>according to Steven McFarland of the Annandale, Va.-based Center for Law and Religious Freedom. McFarland noted that the court ruled only that the club's president, vice-president, and music coordinator must be Christians, but made no similar requirement for its activity coordinator and secretary. <BR> <B>...Thus, the court substituted its judgment for the judgment of the students</B> in deciding which positions needed to be filled by Christians, McFarland said. &quot;Students should decide what positions are essential to the furtherance of their mission or message,&quot; McFarland told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Allowing school administrators or judges to draw those distinctions is &quot;a big mistake,&quot; he said.   <BR> <B>...The case is a &quot;silly compromise&quot; between free speech </B>and &quot;some alleged school interest in diversity,&quot; McFarland said. &quot;Now there's a little hole in the dam. I'm hoping it doesn't get any bigger.&quot;    </font></p>

Judaism is growing in Russia</H3>
Many Jews are rediscovering their roots</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Judaism is experiencing a rebirth in Russia, </B>a land many Jews have long wanted to leave.  Hundreds of thousands of Jews emigrated from the Soviet Union, and many more tried to, but were refused permission.  Though anti-Semitism remains strong and blatant, many Jews now want to stay and build a life in Russia. <BR> <B>...The trend ranks among the most significant developments in 20th century Jewish life,</B> Eugene Weiner of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee told <I>The Christian Science Monitor</I>.  Other comparable trends this century are the establishment of the American Jewish community, the founding of the state of Israel, and the Holocaust, Weiner said.  The countries of the former Soviet Union contain the third-largest population of Jews in the world after the United States and Israel. <BR> <B>...Most Russian Jews have grown up not knowing what it means to be Jewish.  </B>They have had no contact with Jewish traditions, and 75% of them have married non-Jews.  Despite the dissolving of Jews into the larger population, Jews still were subject to suspicion and bias, especially in politics and employment opportunities.  Why the Jews maintained their Jewish identity in spite of what they've been through is a &quot;great mystery and miracle,&quot; Weiner said. <BR> <B>...A desire for cultural identity, rather than a search for God</B>, is at the root of the reawakening of Jewishness.  Jewish schools are opening all over the former Soviet Union.  Some universities have begun academic programs on Jewish history and culture or are teaching Hebrew and Yiddish.  Jews built a synagogue in Moscow, and its opening was attended by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. <BR> <B>...Natan Sharansky returned to Moscow today for the first time</B> since KGB agents arrested him two decades ago.  Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident who fought for the rights of Soviet Jews to leave for Israel and spent nine years in prison, now is Israel's trade minister.  Sharansky bowed his head and said a prayer in Hebrew at the grave of human rights activist Andrei Sakharov.    </font></p>

Almost 4,000 people respond to Christian drama</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A drama about heaven and hell drew 30,000 people to a church in Lake Charles, La., </B>over nine weekends. <I>The Judgment</I> was meant to be an &quot;illustrated sermon&quot; performed only four times in late August. But attendance and response to the play, which had been advertised mainly by word of mouth, grew so rapidly that it was presented 21 times. <BR> <B>...More than 3,900 people became Christians or recommitted their lives to Christ</B> during performances of <I>The Judgment</I>, written by staff members at Glad Tidings Assemblies of God church in Lake Charles. In the hour-and-a-half drama, characters rise to heaven or are condemned to hell based on their decision whether to follow Christ. The theme is similar to<I> Heaven's Gates &amp; Hell's Flames</I>, a Canadian play that has dramatically affected some congregations in North America. <BR> <B>...A large number of those who came forward during altar calls at the end of the presentations were not regular church attenders</B>, according to Jayce Bosman, a church staff member and son of pastor John Bosman. One man who had not been to church in 22 years committed his life to Christ, Bosman said. Some church groups traveled three to four hours in vans and buses to get to the church, and many people stood in lines for hours waiting to get in. <BR> <B>...Some of those dedicating their lives to Christ were young people, and most were under 50 years old</B>. The new believers ranged from &quot;very low income to leading members of the community,&quot; Jayce Bosman told <I>Religion News Today</I>. One man said 22 members of his family were saved. Those attending came from numerous denominations, with Catholic and Baptist being the most common. The decisions were obviously sincere, Bosman said; some people were crying and others had &quot;great excitement and joy on their faces.&quot; <BR> <B>...The drama has brought renewal to other churches</B> <B>in Lake Charles and beyond</B>. In an unprecedented meeting after the presentations ended, 100 area ministers of various denominations gathered for a luncheon to discuss the revival. Many reported an impact on members of their congregations, including those whose marriages were saved when spouses gave their lives to Christ. One pastor from a small church baptized seven people who had seen the play, Bosman said. The presentation ended Oct. 27 so that an extensive follow-up program could begin, and is expected to be repeated in the spring.    </font></p>

Laurie spoke of problems that plague young people, and promised that Christ would be the parent, friend, and confidant they need. &quot;Jesus walked in our shoes.

Conflicts arise between prayer groups, neighbors</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>At a time when churches are encouraging home-based prayer groups, conflicts with neighbors </B>are arising around the nation. <BR> <B>...After one angry neighbor complained about cars and late-night noise, </B>the city of Pleasant Hill, Calif., told Charlie and Betty Peissner to get a permit or stop holding meetings in their living room. The Peissners, charismatic Catholic grandparents who have been hosting prayer meetings for 26 years, have an average of 30 visitors each Wednesday, though the number may go as high as 50. The meetings include singing, praying, speaking in tongues, and healing. They end about 10 p.m., but some people have stayed until 1 a.m. One night this summer, a young child from the meeting cried late at night and a car blocked a driveway, Betty Peissner acknowledged. <BR> <B>...The Peissners have apologized to their neighbors</B> for that incident, and now ask guests to leave by 11 p.m. But the couple refuses to comply with the city and ask for a permit. &quot;We could lose everything if that's what it takes,&quot; Betty Peissner told <I>Religion News Today</I>. &quot;We are prepared to stand our ground.&quot;<B> </B>The September deadline set by the city to apply for the permit has come and gone. <BR> <B>...The city's code enforcement officer says the Peissners are running a religious institution. </B>Keith Hunt noted that the meetings involve a regular congregation gathering on a particular day of the week and  performing a traditional ceremony. He sent letters Sept. 6 and 19 advising the Peissners that they need a permit like those issued to large child-care facilities. <BR> <B>...The Peissners disagree,</B> saying they do not have a regular membership and do not take up a collection. They say they are just welcoming guests into their home to sing and praise God.  <BR> <B>...Similar prayer group-neighbor conflicts have appeared elsewhere in the country</B>. According to attorney David Melton of the Rutherford Institute, a religious rights group, there have been several cases in which Hassidic Jews in New York were ordered to stop holding Sabbath worship. Also, a North Carolina man was told to stop meeting for prayer with two or three other people in his home on Sundays and a small group of Florida ministers were told they could not meet in a home. <BR> <B>...Underlying the tensions is &quot;a vendetta against religion,&quot;</B> Melton told <I>RNT</I>. Many people consider religion as &quot;the pornography of the '90s&quot; -- something that should stay behind closed doors and not be spoken about or enter civic life, he said. Inappropriately noisy prayer groups should be treated like noisy beer parties -- call the police, Melton said. But requiring a permit for a prayer meeting is prior restraint that limits the free exercise of religion. <BR>         </font></p>

Religious leaders urge American shoppers to shun products
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>As the holiday shopping season approaches, Americans should be aware that some products in stores are manufactured in sweatshops</B> in the United States and abroad, a U.S. labor official and religious leaders said. At a news conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich praised the leaders -- representing Baptist, Episcopal, United Methodist, Catholic, and Jewish organizations -- for raising the ethical issue of sweatshops, where wages are extremely low and working conditions unsafe. Reich said his 800 inspectors cannot protect the rights of 110 million American workers in 6.5 million workplaces. <BR> <B>...Americans have a responsibility to make sure workers are treated fairly and with dignity</B>, the leaders said. Christians who ignore sweatshop conditions are not fulfilling their calling to be their neighbors' keepers, a representative of the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries said. The religious leaders said they planned to speak out from the pulpit, mobilize communities, and contact retailers. <BR> <B>...&quot;Selective buying&quot; is one way to increase pressure on manufacturers</B>, said Archie LeMone of the Progressive National Baptist Convention. Every three months, the Labor Department releases names of firms that deal with sweatshops. On Nov. 27, the federal government plans to release its annual list of companies that have taken extra steps to ensure their goods are not made in sweatshops. The religious leaders have not urged a boycott of any specific brands.     </font></p>

Persecution: Christians becoming world's scapegoats?</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A campaign to help persecuted Christians is beginning to show results</B>.  The Clinton Administration is forming a committee of  20 prominent religious leaders and scholars to advise the U.S. secretary of state on problems of religious oppression and intolerance. The panel, which will be housed in the State Department, will make recommendations in areas such as diplomacy, refugees, and using religious leaders to resolve disputes. Last month, the Senate and House passed similar non-binding resolution condemning abuses of Christians around the world and calling on responsible governments to stop the persecution. <BR> <B>...Persecution of Christians around the world is continuing at an alarming rate</B>.<B> </B>It is among the most severe human rights problems in the world, various observers say. More people have been martyred for their Christian faith in the 20th century than in the previous 19 centuries combined, according to <I>World Missions Digest</I>. In <I>By Their Blood</I>, authors James and Marti Hefley say 100 million Christians have been persecuted since 1900, resulting in more deaths from persecution than in all the wars of this century combined. Statistics are only estimates since much of the persecution is done covertly, Dwight Gibson of the World Evangelical Fellowship told <I>Religion News Today</I>.  <BR> <B>...Christians may soon replace Jews as the number one scapegoat in most of the world, </B> according to Michael Horowitz , a senior fellow at the Washington-based Hudson Institute. &quot;The persecution of Jews in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s is almost a perfect mirror image of what's happening to Christians as we enter the 21st century,&quot; he said.  <A HREF= http://www.Freedomhouse.org >Freedom House's Puebla Program on Religious Freedom </A>has complied a catalogue of victimized Christians.  <BR> <B>...Christians are jailed and tortured.</B> The oppressors are largely Communist regimes such as Cuba and North Korea and from militant Muslim movements in the Middle East. In North Korea, the government has tried to stamp out Christianity and established an official state religion -- <I>Juche</I>, or self-reliance -- that requires worship of the nation's leaders, the World Evangelical Fellowship said. Christians also are severely persecuted because of their faith in countries such as Sudan, Vietnam, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Iran, various groups say. <BR> .<B>...China has more Christians in prison for their faith than any other country</B>. This year has been the most repressive for Catholics and Protestants since the late 1970, according to American Christians working there.  Chinese police are circulating warrants for the arrest of 3,000 evangelical preachers, while thousands of others &quot;languish in China's religious gulag&quot; for defying Communist government orders that ban free worship, Freedom House said. <BR> <B>...Converting from Christianity to Islam is punishable by death in several Islamic countries</B>. In many countries Christians are imprisoned, enslaved, tortured and killed because of their faith. In Pakistan, a 13-year-old boy fled the country after he was convicted under Pakistan's blasphemy law. His uncle, who also converted, was shot dead by some in a mob outside the courthouse. Three Christians were kidnapped and murdered in Iran in 1994 as part of a crackdown on the Iranian Christian community. Several monks were beheaded May 20 in Algeria. Catholic bishops and priests and Protestant pastors are routinely imprisoned, Bibles are confiscated, and churches raided in Vietnam and other countries. <BR> <B>...An Islamic court in Kuwait declared Robert Hussein,  a convert from Islam to Christianity,</B>  guilty of apostasy this May. The presiding judge, Jaafar al-Mazidi, affirmed the Islamic teaching that says, &quot;If one who is born from two Muslim parents should commit apostasy, the Imam should kill him without a chance to repent.&quot; Hussein went into hiding and, after an outpouring of protests from the international community, came to the United States. <BR> <B>...American Christians remain largely silent about the persecution.  </B>Church leaders say the problem is not new, and they have feared speaking out would jeopardize missionaries abroad, but now say something must be done. &quot;It would be an absolute travesty if we were to turn a deaf ear to the cries of the persecuted,&quot; said Steven Snyder, head of Washington, D.C.-based International Christian Concern. He has monitored the persecution of Christians for 10 years. &quot;We have a biblical mandate to remember those in prison and those ill-treated as if you were their fellow prisoners,&quot; he said. Christians in the West can help by staying alert to the plight of  persecuted  believers and launching letter-writing campaigns to political leaders, observers say.  <BR> <B>...The first International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church</B> Sept. 29 was intended to draw attention to the problem. The event was initiated by the <A HREF= http://www.xc.org/wef/ > World Evangelical Fellowship </A>, a group representing 150 million evangelical Christians in 110 countries. Evangelical alliances and supporting organizations from 106 countries on all seven continents joined 40 denominational and parachurch groups in the United States to support the Day of Prayer.     </font></p>

Bakker says his message and lifestyle were wrong, but he didn't
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Jim Bakker says he did not cheat his followers out of millions of dollars in the 1980s. </B> But the former evangelist blames himself for preaching and living an extravagant lifestyle that contradicted Jesus' message to love God, not money. <BR> <B>...Bakker makes the statements in his new book,  <I>I Was Wrong</I> (Thomas Nelson Publishers), and in an interview</B> with Barbara Walters aired Friday on ABC-TV's <I>20/20</I>  (10 p.m. Eastern). The interview was the first televised since Bakker's release from prison in 1994. <BR> <B>...&quot;It was wrong as a minister of the gospel, I believe, to live that way,&quot;</B> Bakker tells Walters. &quot;Back then, I felt it was fine and justifiable.&quot; <BR> <B>....In the interview and book, Bakker focuses on his relationship with Tammy Faye Messner,</B> his former wife of 30 years and former co-host of the PTL television show. He also discusses his five years in federal custody. Bakker originally was sentenced to 45 years. <BR> <B>...In 1989, a federal jury in Charlotte, N.C., convicted Bakker of conspiracy and wire and mail fraud</B>. Jurors agreed with charges that Bakker fraudulently sold 150,000 lifetime partnerships to the ministry's elaborate Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill, S.C. Prosecutors said PTL partners were told they could stay at the park's Heritage Grand Hotel free for three nights each year for life; the partnerships were a form of time-share transactions that were illegally oversold, prosecutors said. <BR> <B>...Bakker insists he did nothing wrong in his dealings with PTL's lifetime partners</B>. He writes that he never guaranteed partners they could have a particular room or time of the year. &quot;I never 'sold' lifetime partnerships at PTL,&quot; Bakker writes in<I> I Was Wrong. </I>&quot;The fraud charges brought against me by the government and propagated by the press implied that I had been selling 'time-shares.'...I emphatically told our viewers that lifetime partnerships were not time-shares.&quot; <BR> <B>...In the book, Bakker writes about being sexually molested by a man when he was 11 years old</B>, questioning his sexuality in prison, and being assured by a prison therapist that he was not homosexual. He says the sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn, which led to his 1987 downfall, was a 15- to 20-minute tryst. &quot;My conscience screamed at me every step of the way,&quot; Bakker wrote. <BR> <B>...Bakker's lowest point in prison came when he found out Tammy was divorcing him</B> to marry his best friend, Roe Messner. &quot;I wept...and wept...and wept,&quot; he writes. <BR> <B>... Bakker, who lives on a small, rented farm in Hendersonville, N.C., told Walters that he is lonely</B> and would like to remarry but is not dating anyone. &quot;I miss Tammy Faye,&quot; he said. ``I don't have the need to be on television. I don't have the need to succeed at something big. I would like to help people. I hope I could go back to prison some time to minister to prisoners. I really care about them.&quot;  <BR> <B>...Thomas Nelson Publishers will print at least 200,000 copies of Bakker's book.</B> Rolf Zettersten, a Nelson spokesman, told <I>The Charlotte Observer</I> that Bakker doesn't expect to make any money on the book. All proceeds from the sales will go to the IRS for Bakker's back taxes and to lawyers, Zettersten said. <BR> <B> ...Tammy Faye Messner has written her own book</B>, <I>Tammy: Telling It My  Way</I> (Villard, $22.95). ABC-TV will air an interview with her <I>PrimeTime Live</I> Tuesday (10 p.m. Eastern).    </font></p>

Revival is impacting Grand Rapids, Mich.</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A movement of God is dramatically impacting a church in Grand Rapids, Mich</B>. Services at First Assembly of  God formerly followed a tightly structured, predictable, and rigidly timed sequence of events. Senior pastor Wayne Benson received complaints if a service stretched on too long.  <BR> <B>...But on May 22, 1996, during a midweek service, people began to cry out spontaneously to God</B>. Bible-study classes were canceled that evening as what had been planned as a brief time of worship stretched late into the night. <BR> <B>...The church began holding three and four hour services -- with no complaints</B>. On one Sunday, Benson was delivering his sermon when people rushed to the altar to ask for God's forgiveness. Some 2,000 people were &quot;on their faces before God,&quot; Benson told <I>What's New</I>, an Assemblies of God publication. &quot;I've never seen that. I don't move congregations to do that,&quot; he said, emphasizing that the revival is God's work and is not caused by man.  <BR> <B>...The revival began at a low point in the life of the church, </B>a middle-class congregation of Dutch, Polish, and other ethnic groups.<B> </B>Attendance and donations were flat. Benson had developed a nodule on his vocal chord, and had been warned by a physician not to preach for a month. Benson traveled to Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Fla., where a revival has been in progress since 1995. At Brownsville, Benson was healed of the nodule and freed of  emotional and spiritual bondage, according to Paul Kopenkoskey, First Assembly's communications director.   <BR> <B>...Since May, 1,700 people have accepted Christ as their savior and 2,000 have asked for prayer</B>. Many people have been healed of ailments, including cancer, and others have experienced spiritual restoration, including the healing of childhood memories, Kopenkoskey told <I>Religion News Today</I>. A man who had been raped as a child and suffered depression all his life came to the altar one night and was spiritually healed. &quot;He is a totally new man and does not suffer that bondage any more,&quot; Kopenkoskey said. Other manifestations have occurred, such as so-called holy laughter, but services have remained &quot;decent and in order&quot; with nothing that would &quot;bring shame to the Lord,&quot; Kopenkoskey said. <BR> <B>...A woman who worked as a dancer in a bar said &quot;it was like taking a shower on the inside&quot;</B> when she became a Christian. During her baptism ceremony, she told the congregation about leaving her lesbian companion, prompting a homosexual man in the congregation to come forward and also accept Christ. Witches and Satan worshippers have visited First Assembly to curse the revival, but at least one has run out of the door when church members &quot;rebuked them in the name of Jesus.&quot; <BR> <B>...First Assembly began holding Friday night services on Aug. 9.</B> Some 2,000-3,000 people now attend, including as many as 200 area pastors from a variety of denominations, including mainline churches. Because of resulting renewal among pastors at the services, the revival has the potential to spread to other churches, Kopenkoskey said.    </font></p>

Violent, troubled young people find a new kind of gang in
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A group of former gang members in Boston says their new faith in Christ has helped them avoid drugs and violence</B>. The group, which calls itself God's Posse, is made up of about 25 young black men who once were among the city's most dangerous gangsters. &quot;These are extreme individuals,&quot; Posse co-founder Richard Williamson, a public school math teacher and church deacon, told <I>The Boston Globe</I>. <BR> <B>...Posse members don't drink, smoke, do drugs, or carry weapons</B>. Instead, they pray and worship together in a house they call the Holy House, and take their message to others at a YMCA. Members also try to abstain from sex until marriage, although they say the temptations are numerous. <BR> <B>...Half the Posse members recently left prison, and some encountered God while behind bars</B>. Williamson and co-founder Chris Womack, who used to sell drugs and weapons, started the ministry by talking to prisoners. Many did not listen to their message about God, but some did. Former gangsters say they were just tired of running away from the police. Their lives were violent and lonely, and the Posse has been as close to a stable family as they have ever had. <BR> <B>...Trusting God in the inner-city often takes courage.</B> Posse members say God protects them from harm, describing how bullets have narrowly missed them and guns pointed at their heads have jammed. Three Posse members once intentionally walked into a crowd of boys who were archenemies of their old gang. The boys reached for their guns, but the incident ended with everyone praying and holding hands, <I>The Globe</I> said. Another young man tells how he was baptized by a former gang member he once tried to kill. <BR> <B>...Friends tell the Posse members they'll be back to their old ways in six months.</B> But the young men say that, although their path is littered with temptations, they refuse to let it happen.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Child poverty is more prevalent in the United States than anywhere else in the industrialized nations</B>, a study by a Christian group found. <BR> <B>...Some 21.5% of American children are poor</B>, the highest rate among industrialized nations, according to the study done by Bread for the World Institute. The group, a companion agency to nondenominational, Silver Spring, Md.-based Bread for the World, said 13.6 million children in the United States are hungry or at risk of hunger. It did not define the poverty level. <BR> <B>...Out-of-wedlock births are not the main cause of poverty, </B>the report said.<B> </B>&quot;Economic and social forces beyond the control of  poor people -- such as declining real wages for low-skilled workers<B> -- </B>are more significant causes,&quot; it said.<B> </B>The report mentioned estimates that an additional 1.1 million children will be pushed into poverty by the welfare bill passed by the 104th Congress. <BR> <B>...Government has a crucial role to play in reducing hunger and poverty </B>because many people cannot escape poverty on their own, the report said. There will be broad support in Congress next year to attack poverty, the charity predicted. It said 500 congressional candidates out of 1,229 who were contacted signed a pledge to support federal programs to help end childhood hunger. <BR> <B>...An increasing number of people are hungry in former communist countries, </B>Bread for the World said. The largest number of hungry people live in South Asia, but hunger has declined throughout Asia and the Pacific, mainly because of  effective anti-hunger polices, the group said.    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Two World Relief staff members were robbed, shot, and killed today</B> in Kompong Cham, Cambodia, as they left a neighborhood in which World Relief works. The two women, Khoun Sokan and Toun Chanthom, had been meeting with a group of neighborhood women who receive small loans to start businesses to earn income so they can feed and clothe their impoverished families, Wheaton, Ill.-based World Relief said. One of  the women died immediately and the other several hours later. <BR> <B>...Sokan and Chanthom were single parents and had worked for World Relief since the Gateway Program</B> began in Kompong Cham in 1944. Both women were Christians and active in their churches, the group said. World Relief is the international assistance arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, USA. <BR> <B>...The Gateway Program began in 1992 in Phnom Penh</B>. It combines basic lessons on money management with good health practices in weekly neighborhood meetings. More than 8,300 women have received loans through the program. World Relief estimated that its staff members in Cambodia have made more than 12,000 trips to and from the neighborhood meetings without serious incident. <BR> <B>...&quot;Sokan and Chanthom paid the ultimate price as they faithfully served</B> the needs of poor women and their children,&quot; said Joel Copple, World Relief's Cambodia director.    </font></p>

Judge allows homosexual marriages in Hawaii</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Homosexual and lesbian marriages are legal, a state judge in Hawaii ruled on Tuesday</B>. Circuit Court judge Kevin S.C. Chang ordered the state to end a ban against giving marriage licenses to same-sex couples, marking the first time a U.S. court has ruled that such couples have the same right to marry as heterosexual couples. <BR> <B>...Courtroom maneuvering makes it unclear when the first same-sex marriage would take place in Hawaii,</B> and homosexual advocacy groups advised would-be spouses against hopping on planes and heading for Waikiki. Hawaii Deputy Attorney General Rick Eichor said he would file for a stay of  Chang's order. The court is expected to let the ban remain in effect during the state's appeal to the Hawaii Supreme Court. In 1993, the court ruled that the ban on same-sex marriages violates the state constitution's prohibition against gender discrimination. The Hawaii Supreme Court sent the case back to a lower court to give the state a chance to justify the ban against same-sex marriages. If the court rules as it did in 1993, the legal battle in Hawaii would be over and the marriage licenses would be granted. <BR> <B>...The legal struggle on the mainland is only beginning</B>. The prospect of would-be gay spouses flocking to Hawaii to wed prompted so much opposition this fall that Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of homosexual marriages and permits states not to recognize such marriages licensed in other states. President Clinton signed the election-season bill, though his spokesman denounced it as &quot;gay-baiting.&quot; Sixteen states have passed their own version of the ban on same-sex marriages, and 20 states have defeated such bills.  <BR> <B>...There are likely to be major disputes in federal courts</B> over whether the states are bound by the U.S. Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot; clause to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. A court-by-court-battle on that issue could take years.  <BR> <B>...The ruling &quot;basically redefines marriage,&quot; </B>said Deputy Attorney General Eichor, who argued the case for the state of Hawaii. Eichor said legalizing same-sex marriages would open the door to demands that bigamy, polygamy, and consensual incestuous relationships be licensed as well. Judge Chang's ruling cited expert testimony that homosexual and lesbian couples can be good parents and rejected the state's argument that children thrive best when raised by heterosexual parents. <BR> <B>...Opponents of same-sex marriages promised a fight.</B> With society in &quot;a moral crisis...this is hardly the time to be tinkering with the definition of marriage,&quot; said Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition. The American Center for Law and Justice, which represented eight state legislators who unsuccessfully sought to intervene in the case, called the ruling an &quot;outrage.&quot; ACLJ attorney Jay Sekulow said marriage as a legal union between man and woman &quot;has served all cultures well. There is no legal or moral reason to change it.&quot; <BR> <B>...Chang's ruling has &quot;ushered in a new era of lawlessness,&quot;</B> said Robert Knight of the Washington-based Family Research Council. He denounced the ruling as a denial of  &quot;not only the wisdom of generations but the law of nature and nature's God. No law that contradicts the fundamental moral law is legitimate. This means that the court has now acted lawlessly, and the people of Hawaii, who have spoken repeatedly and clearly about this issue, would be well justified in seeking Judge Chang's removal from the bench.&quot; According to recent surveys, 70%-75% of Hawaiians oppose same-sex marriages. <BR> <B>...&quot;It's time for Americans to examine and to exercise ways to nullify the actions of judges</B> who flout the law. This is no small legal matter, but an assault on morality and the rule of law itself,&quot; Knight said. He also said that the Hawaii attorney general's office &quot;deliberately under-argued the case&quot; by concentrating on the harm to children and ignoring evidence that homosexuality is &quot;destructive to individuals, families, and society and that homosexuality is a changeable condition.&quot; <BR> <B>...Chang's ruling was &quot;judicial tyranny,&quot; said Lou Sheldon</B>, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition in Anaheim, Calif. &quot;We are now entering an age of moral anarchy,&quot; said Pierre Bynum, editor <I>of Capitol Hill Prayer Alert</I>, a Washington, D.C.- based Christian ministry. <BR> <B>...The ruling could be a blessing in disguise since it will stir up &quot;even more anger, frustration</B>, and bitterness in the community toward the courts and elected officials,&quot; said Mike Gabbard, chairman of the Alliance for Traditional Marriage-PAC in Hawaii. The Hawaii Legislature will consider a constitutional amendment next year banning same-sex marriage, but prospects for passage are uncertain, Gabbard said. This year, the lawmakers failed to agree on either a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages or on domestic partnership legislation giving homosexual and lesbian couples the legal and financial benefits of married couples. If all legislative efforts fail, voters can propose a constitutional amendment at an upcoming constitutional convention, which would take place in 1998 or 2000, Gabbard said.    </font></p>

Gospel Truck rolls through the inner-city</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Instant congregations pop up in Washington, D.C., neighborhoods</B> when the Gospel Truck arrives.  The 24-foot converted Ryder van contains a powerful sound system, theater lighting, four large speakers, and a 7,000-watt generator.  <BR> <B>...The truck enters the poorest, most troubled neighborhoods and housing developments</B>, according to Ken Brown, the 36-year-old Assemblies of God minister who designed the truck to be a kind of mobile evangelism center.  Soon after arriving, a crowd forms.  Christian rap groups perform, and Brown or another local minister preaches.  Services may last two hours -- or as long as eight if things really get going.  This December, Christmas stockings full of toys and candy, donated by local congregations, were handed out from the truck.  An altar call always is given. <BR> <B>...Brown, an inner-city missionary for 12 years, </B>&quot;always had done it the old-fashioned way: preach my heart out and pass out Bibles,&quot; he told <I>Religion News Today</I>.  A few years ago, he bought the truck and had workers install conduits for lighting and sound, and build a flip-up lighting system. <BR> <B>...Brown doesn't just roll into town, preach, and roll out again.  </B>He and his wife Kathy and their four children live in a poor area of D.C. They are the only white family in the neighborhood. The city has one of the highest murder rates in the country and an infant-mortality rate higher than some Third World countries. <BR> <B>...The Browns usually have an additional one or two inner-city children living with them.  </B>Some stay for short periods of time.  But others -- such as a girl whose mother abandoned her children and went on a crack cocaine binge -- remain with them for as long as four years.   <BR> <B>...Washington D.C., is far from the rural, Cascade Mountain town </B>outside of Seattle where Brown grew up.  He graduated from Yale University in 1982 with a history degree, then headed for law school.  But that is when Brown's life dramatically changed, he told <I>Religion News Today</I>.  One day while walking, God &quot;impressed on my heart&quot; the fact that He had a different plan, and to wait for details. <BR> <B>...&quot;I got on the bus and went home (from law school),&quot;</B> Brown said.  &quot;It was a radical thing.&quot; For two years, Brown worked at various jobs, scraping by financially.  He began reading missionary stories.  In 1985, Brown took a position with Teen Challenge, a drug-rehabilitation ministry in a Washington, D.C., suburb.   <BR> <B>...Then God &quot;took me from the frying pan to the fire,&quot;</B> he said.  Brown resigned from Teen Challenge, began ministering in the Capital full-time, and moved his family into the city in 1993.   <BR> <B>...When Brown enters a neighborhood without the truck, some people who don't know him </B>assume he is a narcotics officer or someone looking to buy drugs.  &quot;But once people know you, you get a reputation.  People know you are there to make a difference.&quot; <BR> <B>...Brown hopes to find a building to house abandoned children</B> in Washington, D.C., a city whose foster-care system is &quot;in a serious shambles,&quot; he said.  He also wants to acquire a facility to house short-term volunteers to assist him in his ministry.  &quot;I know this truck will be duplicated,&quot; he said.  There is a need for it &quot;in every major city in America.&quot;     </font></p>

A <I>Washington Post</I> survey of  more than a thousand of those marchers found that 57% said they were Christian. <BR> <B>...Promise Keepers has grown at a tremendous pace </B>in the six years since it was founded by Bill McCartney, then the head football coach at the University of Colorado. It has a full-time staff of 430 at its headquarters in Boulder, Colo., and an annual budget of $97 million, <I>The Washington Post</I> reported. Sixty percent of the budget comes from the men who pay $60 apiece to attend the stadium events, and the rest comes from donations and sales of PK-related materials. <BR> <B>...The group produces videos, a radio show</B>, and a <A HREF=http://www.promisekeepers.org/>Web site,</A> and publishes books and newsletters. PK also has 38 state offices and a handful of international affiliates. A conference for clergy, held in Atlanta this February, may be duplicated, but will probably not become an annual event, Swickard said.    </font></p>

Religion prominent at the inauguration</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Religion was very much in evidence at President Clinton's inauguration.  </B>The Clintons attended two church services on Sunday and participated in a rousing prayer service Monday morning. <BR> <B>...The Clintons began their day Sunday at Columbia Baptist Church</B>, where Rex Horne, pastor of Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock, Ark., the President's home church, was guest speaker.  Horne's theme was the need for Christians to submit to authority and respect the government as a divinely ordained institution.  He asked the parishioners to honor and pray for Clinton. <BR> <B>...Later on Sunday, the Clintons visited the church they regularly attend,</B> Foundry United Methodist Church.  Pastor J. Philip Wogaman reminded parishioners that the &quot;one who is called to lead the United States of America&quot; is &quot;not as young as four years ago&quot; and needs their prayers. <BR> <B>...The Clintons and vice president Al Gore and his family began inauguration day </B>at an 8. a.m. service at Metropolitan AME Church, a black congregation seven blocks from the White House.  The singing, clapping and preaching went on for so long that Clinton, Gore and their families were late getting back to the White House for a pre-inaugural coffee with leaders of Congress. <BR> <B>...The overflowing crowd of 1,500 people at the Metropolitan AME Church</B> heard readings from a rabbi, a Muslim imam, and a Greek Orthodox archbishop.  Jesse Jackson, who was with Martin Luther King, Jr., when the civil rights leader was killed in Memphis in 1968, urged Clinton not to ignore the plight of the poor.   <BR> <B>...Evangelist Luis Palau, echoing Clinton's campaign theme</B> of building a bridge to the future, thanked God for sending Jesus Christ as the bridge to heaven.  Bill Hybels of the Willow Creek Community Church of South Barrington, Ill., told the congregation that he has visited Clinton once a month for nearly the entire four years of his first term to pray and talk.  National Association of Evangelicals leader Don Argue prayed, and Tony Campolo, an evangelical author and educator who is a friend of the President, preached.   <BR> <B>...Campolo urged politicians to work together</B>.  &quot;This president is tired of the politics of bile.  This speaker of the House (Newt Gingrich) is tired of the politics of bile. Enough of this accusing, and let's move on together, forgiving each other, even as God has forgiven us,&quot; Compolo said. <BR> <B>...Civility and unity were the themes of Clinton's 22-minute inaugural speech </B>on a cold, crisp day.  He quoted Chicago's Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, when facing the end of his life, as saying, &quot;It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time on acrimony and division.&quot; Clinton pledged his efforts to overcome racial divisions.  &quot;Our rich texture of racial, religious, and political diversity will be a Godsend in the 21st century,&quot; he said.  He called the United States a &quot;blessed land of New Promise.&quot; <BR> <B>...The King James Bible that Clinton used to take the oath of office</B> was open to Isaiah 58:12, which reads: &quot;And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in.&quot;  <BR> <B>...Billy Graham, 78, taking part in his eighth inauguration, gave the invocation.  </B>&quot;Where there's been failure, forgive us; where there's been progress, confirm; where there's been success, give us humility and teach us to follow your instructions more closely as we enter the next century,&quot; Graham prayed.   <BR> <B>...Rev. Gardner Taylor gave the benediction</B>.  Music included selections from Children of the Gospel Choir, Immanuel Baptist Church Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra, and Santina Jackson and the Resurrection Choir.  Jessye Norman sang a medley of songs including lines from <I>Amazing Grace</I>. <BR> <B>...On a grassy slope near the Washington Monument, abortion opponents </B>planted 3,300 tiny crosses, symbolizing the number of surgical abortions performed each day in the United States.  Along the inaugural parade route on Pennsylvania Avenue, a few dozen protesters with the Christian Defense Coalition displayed 26 four-foot-high color posters showing aborted fetuses.  A District of Columbia appeals court ruled Sunday that the protesters could not be blocked from demonstrating as the parade went by.  The National Park Service had denied the group's request.      </font></p>

Abortion law approved by South African Parliament</H3>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>South Africa's Parliament has narrowly approved the Termination of Pregnancy Bill, </B>which allows any woman<B> -- </B>including a teenager without parental consent <B>--</B> to have an abortion<B> </B>up to the 12th week of pregnancy. Abortions can also be performed up to the 20th week in pregnancies that result from rape, abuse, or where there is physical or emotional risk. <BR> <B>...Most South Africans oppose the legislation, numerous polls show</B>. Liberalization of the abortion law has faced fierce opposition from Christian, Islamic, and pro-life groups, who have promised to continue holding public demonstrations. <BR> <B>...Pro-choice advocates say the current law is racist. </B>Many white women go overseas to obtain abortions because they are financially able to do so, while impoverished black women have unsafe &quot;back-street&quot; abortions. <BR> <B>...A total of 99 parliamentarians in the 400-member National Assembly boycotted the vote</B>, many citing religious objections, Ecumenical News International said. The Catholic Church has threatened to excommunicate members who aid abortion, although one nun who is a member of Parliament voted for the law. <BR> <B>...The abortion legislation was promoted by President Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress, </B>which instructed its members to follow the party line in the vote, ENI said. The bill now goes to the Senate, where it is all but certain to be adopted, and then to Mandela for signing into law.    </font></p>

Freedom restricted in Russia</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Religious freedom in Russia is deteriorating</B>. Even while ominous changes in the 1990 national law on freedom of conscience are being considered in the Duma, opponents of religious freedom in Russia's republics are becoming more aggressive and successful -- apparently without challenge from the central government. <BR> <B>...In the last two years, one-fourth of Russia's 88 republics have adopted laws </B>harshly restricting religious freedom, Keston News Service reported. The texts of the new laws, obtained from 10 provinces, contain the same ideas and words, showing that opponents of religious freedom in various regions are sharing strategies. All the laws flagrantly violate Russia's 1993 constitution, which ensures all religions equality under the law, KNS said. So far, Russia's constitutional court has refused to review the provincial laws.   <BR> <B>...Pending national legislation could restrict the freedom of foreign missionaries.</B> If enacted, it would  allow religious organizations to operate publicly only by consent of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Orthodox Church &quot;would like to protect our country from the influence of the evangelical churches from abroad,&quot; Alexander Sorokin, editor of <I>Kristianstvo Segodnya,</I> a Russian Christian magazine, said in an interview with <I>Compass Direct</I>. The full Duma is expected to vote on the legislation in December. <BR> <B>...Evangelical Christians have little influence in Russia</B>, where they are not very politically active and have little access to the media, Sorokin said.    </font></p>

Stressed-out Americans consider taking a Sabbath rest</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The Sabbath may be making a comeback in stressed-out America</B>.  The hectic pace of modern life increasingly is prompting people to examine the spiritual, emotional, and physical benefits a Sabbath rest, its proponents say. <BR> <B>...&quot;We're headed for a national nervous breakdown if people don't get some rest</B> on a regular basis,&quot; said Jack Lowndes, a Southern Baptist minister who heads the Lord's Day Alliance, an interdenominational group based in Atlanta.  He describes the Sabbath rest as &quot;cessation of secular activities.&quot; <BR> <B>...The Lord's Day Alliance publishes an 11,000-subscriber quarterly magazine</B> called <I>Sunday, </I>maintains affiliates in several states,<I> </I>and distributes educational information and news through bulletin inserts.  It's leaders say they consider Sunday as the Sabbath, although they respect other groups that celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday. The group's phone number is (770) 936-5376. <I> </I>  <BR> <B>...Many people -- including some Christians -- have &quot;no special feeling&quot; about the Sabbath, </B>Lowndes said.  &quot;You'll be sitting in church and somebody's beeper will go off,&quot; he said.  Exceptions are members of churches affiliated with Presbyterian and Reformed traditions, some of whom maintain a strong adherence to Sabbath observances. <BR> <B>...People need more than just a weekly one-day vacation,</B> according to John Mulder, president of Louisville Presbyterian Seminary.  Appreciation for regular physical rest opens a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; for Christians to tell unchurched people about spiritual rest and worship, Mulder told a meeting of the Lord's Day Alliance last year in Louisville, Ky.    </font></p>

Prisoners in Argentina spread revival</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Argentina's prison system is experiencing a spiritual revival,</B> according to Richard Riss, an American who was part of a group of 70 Christians visiting there recently. The center of the revival is Olmos prison, a maximum security facility. Approximately 1,400 of the 3,000 inmates -- including many former murderers, rapists, and thieves -- have become Christians, Riss said. <BR> <B>...The Olmos prisoners spend much of their time praying for worldwide revival</B>. While his group was visiting, several hundred prisoners held joint services with them. &quot;The prisoners prayed for us, and the Lord touched us all mightily,&quot; Riss said. <BR> <B>...People fax prayer requests to the prisoners</B>. Revivals in other prisons reportedly have begun<B> </B>after<B> </B>prisoners from Olmos are transferred there. <BR> <B>...Argentina has experienced revival since the 1980s</B>. In 1990, a change occurred when unusual spiritual manifestations described as &quot;drunkenness in the Spirit&quot; and &quot;holy laughter&quot; began. In 1993, those manifestations spread from Argentina to Canada after John and Carol Arnott of Toronto visited revival meetings in Argentina. Since then, the so-called &quot;Toronto Blessing&quot; has spread to other parts of the world. <BR> <B>...Children have played a role in Argentina's revival.</B> Riss attended a church service in Buenos Aires during which children led worship, gave testimonies of healings and conversions, and prayed for the sick. A visiting Swiss pastor who was suffering a 90% hearing loss received complete healing when an Argentine child, who had been unaware of the pastor's condition, prayed, &quot;Lord, open his ears,&quot; Riss said. The children also prayed for their classmates, hospital patients, and political leaders.    </font></p>

Anglicans, Lutherans in Europe reach unity agreement </H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Anglicans and Lutherans in Europe have agreed to a sweeping form of  ecumenical unity</B>. Anglican churches in Britain and Ireland and Lutheran churches in the Nordic and Baltic countries formalized their agreement in Trondheim, Norway, last month. <BR> <B>...The denominations will treat baptized members of each others' churches as they do their own members.</B> They also will welcome ordained bishops, pastors, and deacons into any of the 10 churches to minister in accordance with the receiving church's regulations. In addition, the churches plan to consult on various matters of faith.  <BR> <B>...The agreement, known as the Porvoo Declaration, bridges &quot;a Reformation gap,&quot;</B> according to Trondheim's host bishop, Finn Wagle. George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said the document is the most important ecumenical agreement in this century. Ishael Noko, general secretary of  the Lutheran World Federation, called it a &quot;theological breakthrough&quot; that will have a positive effect on Anglican-Lutheran relations worldwide. <BR> <B>... Bishops must acknowledge that &quot;some of us have treated [the episcopy] as an idol </B>that justified us,&quot; said Bishop Richard Holloway of the Scottish Episcopal Church. That is why &quot;so many churches have rejected episcopy,&quot; he said at a service celebrating the agreement. About 1,000 guests, including 24 bishops and five archbishops, took part in the service. Similar services were to take place in Tallin, Estonia and London. <BR> <B>...In the United States, bishops in the Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</B> were holding a joint meeting Oct. 3-8 to consider bringing the denominations into full communion with each other. If approved, such an agreement would allow Episcopal priests and Lutheran pastors to officiate in each others' churches and allow the denominations' members to take communion together. <BR>       </font></p>

U.S. citizen arrested as spy in North Korea</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A U.S. citizen who apparently was working as a Christian missionary in China has been arrested in North Korea and charged with spying</B>. U.S. officials in Seoul, South Korea, are trying to arrange the release of Evan Carl Hunzike, 26, who was arrested  Aug. 24. South Korea and the United States deny that Hunzike is a spy. The charge carries a possible death penalty. <BR> <B>...Hunzike was arrested on an island in the Amnok river, called the Yalu in Chinese</B>, bordering China and North Korea. His cousin -- identified only by his family name of Yun -- told reporters that Hunzike is not capable of acting as a spy. <BR> <B>...White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States is seeking more information</B> through the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, North Korea. Washington and Pyongyang have not had diplomatic ties since the Korean War, but the two sides have had liaison offices in each other's capitals since 1994. Hunzike, whose mother is South Korean, is a native of Alaska and attended college in Yakima, Wash.,  his cousin said. <BR> <B>...Tensions between the two Koreas have come close to the breaking point recently</B>. Observers said North Korea's aim in raising the spy charges may be to engage Washington in talks and divert attention from a recent ill-fated submarine incursion. <BR> <B>...South Korea accused North Korea of  sending spies aboard the submarine on  Sept. 18.</B> Twenty-two North Koreans who got off  the submarine have been killed or found dead and one has been captured. North Korea said the submarine was on a training mission when engine trouble caused it to drift south.    </font></p>

Mending broken hearts</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Brian Marcoux leads one to five people to Christ every day</B>. &quot;I have a ripping desire, an unquenchable desire, to reach the lost,&quot; said the 33-year-old Salvation Army counselor. The walls in his Waterbury, Conn., office are full of photos of people he has led to Christ. Marcoux also evangelizes on street corners -- and just about everywhere else. He once redirected an AT&amp;T telephone sales pitch to spiritual matters and led the sales representative to a profession of faith. When Marcoux leaves his family waiting at a gas pump while he is inside paying, his patient wife knows he's witnessing to the clerk or customers. <BR> <B>...Marcoux knows what having a broken heart is like -- and he can sense when others have one</B>, he told <I>Religion News Today</I>. At 5 feet 8 inches, the 225-pound, full-bearded, barrel-chested Marcoux has a past filled with motorcycle gang violence, drugs, orgies, and crime. &quot;It's a sad testimony,&quot; said Marcoux, who said his sinful lifestyle followed a troubled youth and the killing of his beloved brother Brett.  <BR> <B>...&quot;I said kiss off to God. My heart was so badly broken&quot;</B> after Brett's death, Marcoux said. Spiritually, Marcoux began to &quot;get sicker and sicker, searching for the cure. What in the world is going to heal this pain?&quot; he asked. He considered suicide. Then, 10 years ago, someone led Marcoux to Christ and he knew he &quot;found the cure,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...&quot;Now every day I deal with broken hearts and lives,&quot; said Marcoux</B>, who believes God has given him the ability -- he calls it a gift -- to see inside people's hearts by looking into their eyes. &quot;I lean over my desk and say, `Stop. Do you know what is wrong? You have a broken heart, don't you?'&quot; Marcoux said. Invariably, the tears flow. &quot;When those words go forward, It's just like, Bam! I don't say it to everybody, but when God says now is the time to drop the bomb, I drop it.&quot; <BR> <B>...The tone of voice Marcoux uses varies by individual</B>, said Marcoux, who speaks at youth group events as well as in prisons. &quot;I won't do anything ungodly, but if I need to get loud and in somebody's face, I'll do it.&quot; Marcoux evangelizes in biker bars, and has had &quot;big men get in my face screaming and spitting.&quot; Marcoux does not get physically violent, &quot;but when it comes to my King, I get violent, and I am taking it by force.&quot; The lost are &quot;just going to wander off and fall off the cliff,&quot; he said. &quot;Their blood will be on our heads.&quot;    </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Nazarene missionary Ron Farris is presumed dead as a result of the Nov. 23 hijacking and crash</B> of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, State Department sources said. Positive identification of Farris' remains is still pending, according to the Church of the Nazarene. <BR> <B>...The flight was commandeered by three hijackers, thought to be Ethiopians, </B>who were armed with an ax, a fire extinguisher, and a device they claimed was a bomb. At least one of them was drunk, and waved a whiskey bottle, survivors said. The hijackers demanded to go to Australia, but would not let the captain stop to refuel. For three hours, the pilot tried to reason with them, but the plane began to run out of fuel. It crashed near the beach on the Comoros Islands, off the coast of east Africa, killing 123 people. The plane shattered and spewed bodies into the sea, then quickly filled with water. Fifty-two people survived. <BR> <B>...Farris, 46, was &quot;an outstanding surgeon, a committed missionary</B>, and a man who carried a burden for Africa's suffering people,&quot; church official Richard F. Zanner said. Farris, his wife, Anita, and their four children have been Nazarene missionaries since 1987. One of Farris' responsibilities was managing  medical clinics that treat 40,000 people a year. He also helped perform the Kansas City area's first liver transplant in 1980.    </font></p>

Sermon turns into shouting match over homosexuality</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>The pastor of a Michigan church who criticized two homosexual congregants from the pulpit</B> last Sunday plans to renew his attack at services this weekend, he told <I>The Detroit News</I>. Don Campbell, pastor of Watervliet's Congregational Church, criticized Kip Thumm, 28, who openly acknowledges his homosexuality. Thumm said he will be at services again this Sunday and expects to be accompanied by hundreds of supporters carrying picket signs and holding a candlelight vigil. <BR> <B>...Thumm said Campbell called him several days before last Sunday's service</B> and told him he was not  welcome at the church. Thumm, a lifelong church member, said his parents were married in the church, he went to Sunday school and Boy Scout meetings there, and that Campbell buried his father. &quot;I'm not going to let him keep me away,&quot; he said. <BR> <B>...During the service, when Campbell saw Thumm in a front pew accompanied by 30 supporters</B>, he changed the sermon topic from the importance of Veterans Day to homosexuality. The pastor said homosexuals should be cast out of God's house.  <BR> <B>...Then things got out of hand,</B> <I>The News</I> reported. A few of Thumm's supporters shouted, stood up, and pointed at Campbell. He responded by saying, &quot;This isn't an open forum&quot; and &quot;Read the Bible, young man!&quot; <BR> <B>...Then an elderly man grabbed the arm of one of Thumm's supporters, telling him to let the pastor finish talking</B>. When Campbell jumped down from the pulpit and tried to calm the elderly man, one of Thumm's supporters stood up and addressed the congregation, saying &quot;God loves us! Homosexuality is more than sex. It's about pride and identity!&quot; The man then burst into tears as he was escorted out. Another congregant rose and pointed his finger at Thumm's supporters, yelling that he hadn't come to &quot;listen to you people,&quot; but to worship God. Campbell managed to regain order, telling the congregants to &quot;go in peace.&quot;    </font></p>

Sluggish year for Bible sales</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Bible sales in the United States appear to have reached a saturation point.</B> At a time when Christians in some impoverished countries lack enough copies of Scripture to go around, Americans increasingly are letting Bibles collect dust on bookstore shelves.  <BR> <B>...Sales in the $200-million market for Bibles are peculiarly sluggish this year, publishers say</B>. This summer, the Family Bookstore chain shipped back $200,000 worth of King James Bibles that were gathering dust on shelves, <I>The New York Times</I> reported. In June, Bible sales fell to $3.7 million, a 48% decease compared to the same period last year, according to the Association of American Publishers, which tracks general trade publishers. Thomas Nelson reported its Bible revenues down 6%. <BR> <B>...There are just too many Bibles for too few Christians</B>, observers say. Several hundred Bible versions have been published, targeting every conceivable special-interest group. Some say the many different versions confuse buyers, who don't know how to choose among the numerous options. <BR> <B>...Some new Bible versions have their detractors</B>. Critics call easy-to-read Bibles -- which accommodate people who find other versions too difficult -- the &quot;dumbed-down&quot; versions, Ecumenical News International said. Other Bible versions contain paraphrases or liner notes that slant the meaning to meet theological or social-political criteria, critics say.    </font></p>

In a policy switch, U.S. will fight religious persecution</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has promised to make religious liberty</B> a top priority of U.S. foreign policy.  Her department issued its annual report Jan. 30 documenting repression around the world.  Religious repression persists &quot;in too many countries, from Sudan to Vietnam to Iran, [and] in a few, including China, it has increased,&quot; she said. Christians are &quot;subject to difficulties ranging from interference to outright persecution in many countries, including Iraq, Pakistan and Sudan,&quot; the report says. <BR> <B>...The situation deteriorated last year in China</B>, Myanmar, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Sudan, Indonesia, Albania, Cuba, Belarus, and Algeria, the report said.  It noted improvements in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yugoslavia, Russia, Haiti, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Ghana, Mali, Sierra Leone, Bulgaria, Romania and Liberia. <BR> <B>...The United States is pressing Saudi Arabia</B> to permit U.S. troops and diplomatic staff to worship freely in the strictly Islamic kingdom, assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck said.  The rights report stated that freedom of religion &quot;does not exist&quot; there, where public and private non-Muslim religious activities are banned.  It cited a case where a Christian service was broken up by police and the man who hosted the service was lashed. <BR> <B>...The new U.S. emphasis on religious liberty is a departure from the past.  </B>The report leveled greater criticism at several countries that are allies of Washington, including Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.  It gave Germany high marks for religious freedom, except for its restriction on members of the Church of Scientology.   <BR> <B>...&quot;This is a very definite turn of events,&quot; </B>Don Argue, head of the <A HREF=http://www.nae.net/>National Association of Evangelicals</A>, told <I>Religion News Today</I>.  President Clinton assured Argue last year that he would oppose religious persecution, making it a high priority for his administration.  Argue said a number of Christians criticized him for believing Clinton, but now the president is &quot;putting action to what he promised.&quot;  Argue is part of a multifaith task force advising the U.S. State Department on persecution overseas.  The group will hold its first meeting Feb. 12.    </font></p>

Christian radio: Tuning out the world?</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>Christian radio is mostly preaching to the choir.</B> Almost all its programming is meant to teach and motivate the 80% of  its 40 million listeners a week who are Christians. This is a valid ministry, but observers ask what can Christian radio do for the 20% of its listeners who aren't believers. <BR> <B>...&quot;Face it: our impact on the non-Christian world is minimal,&quot;</B> said Wayne Pederson, executive director of SkyLight Satellite Network, based in St. Paul, Minn. Non-Christian listeners tune into Christian radio for a variety of reasons. Some are 'secondary listeners' whose spouses tune in -- or are in an office car pool with the radio on. Others are attracted by discussions about parenting, marriage, and politics, just appreciate the music, or are seeking to understand Christianity. But they do not often hear the &quot;plan of salvation,&quot; Pederson said. <BR> <B>...Christian radio is not evangelistic because its Christian listeners want it that way. </B>Unlike Christian radio overseas, Christian Radio in the United States &quot;is 'me' radio. It has to interest me and relate to me,&quot; Pederson told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Out of concern for ratings, stations must give listeners what they want, Pederson said. Also, Christian broadcasters spend so much time &quot;criticizing the unbelievers in the culture, or attacking other Christians&quot; that they lose opportunities to change lives, Pederson wrote in <I>Religious Broadcasting</I>, a magazine published by National Religious Broadcasters. <BR> <B>...Recognizing that the United States is the fifth-largest mission field in the world, </B>a few Christian broadcasters are taking steps to shape a less introspective and more evangelistic medium. A group of 12 Christian stations owned by K-LOVE radio of Sacramento, Calif., airs evangelistic programs on Wednesdays once a month. Listeners are invited to call in for information about salvation.   <BR> <B>...Recently, 18 Christian stations in various parts of the country began an evangelistic project</B> with non-Christian listeners in mind. They are airing 60-second spots by Billy Graham, evangelist Ron Hutchcraft, and Peterson that give the &quot;plan of salvation&quot; and offer a toll-free number to call for information or counseling. Stations air the spots six times daily.  <BR> <B>...Response has been encouraging, organizers say</B>. Among 146 calls received during the first two weeks, 16 people prayed to become Christians and 13 others received assurance of their salvation or recommitted their lives to Christ, counselors said. After the test period, the spots will be made available to all 1,200 Christian stations in the country. <BR> <B>...&quot;If we were to <I>really</I> reach out to non-Christians, programming would have to be very different,&quot;</B> Pederson said. <BR>      </font></p>

Priest ministers to his fellow hostages in Peru</H3>
</b></font></center>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><BR> <B>A Catholic priest is celebrating Mass, administering sacraments, and holding prayer meetings </B>inside the besieged Japanese ambassador's home in Lima, Peru. Juan Julio Wicht is respected by Marxist rebels who are holding 104 hostages at the residence, released hostages say. He is allowed to move freely around the two floors of the building. <BR> <B>...Wicht turned down his chance for freedom</B>, choosing not to join the 225 hostages released Sunday night. &quot;I prefer to stay to help the hostages spiritually. I don't have any family,&quot; said Wicht, according to a hostage freed that night. Wicht reportedly insists he will leave only when the last hostages are out. <BR> <B>...Wicht has led prayer sessions every morning.</B> The Jesuit priest, who teaches at Peru's University of the Pacific, also celebrated Sunday Mass on the stairs that join the two floors of the residence, calling for calm in the crisis. Many of the 330-plus hostages at the Mass took Communion.  <BR> <B>...Yoshimoto Taguchi, a Protestant missionary from Japan who was taken hostage</B>, also participated in the liturgy on Sunday by reading a Bible passage in Japanese and speaking about his hope in God. Taguchi, who is supported by Conservative Baptist congregations in Japan, has lived in Peru for 15 years and leads an interdenominational congregation. He was released Monday, Marty Shaw of CBInternational in Japan told <I>Religion News Today</I>. Taguchi's wife, also taken hostage, was released earlier. <BR> <B>...Catholic Bishop Jose Luis Cipriani of Lima was allowed to enter the residence</B> to celebrate Mass, pray with the hostages, and hear confessions. Cipriani, a conservative known for his support of the governmental policies of President Alberto Fujimori, spent six hours inside the ambassador's home. <BR> <B>...The rebels claim to be acting on behalf of Peru's impoverished masses</B>. At least half of Lima's six million inhabitants live in shantytowns that surround the city. Water is scarce, street children and beggars are common, and garbage dumps are raked over for scraps of food. The rebels, members of The Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, have issued a statement criticizing free-market reforms instituted by Fujimori. Reforms have pulled the economy out of chaos, but have not significantly improved poverty levels in Peru, where wages are low and unemployment is high, the rebels say.    </font></p>

CB International, the Conservative Baptist Foreign Mission Society, identified the missionaries as Rev. Taguchi and his wife. Mrs. Taguchi was subsequently released, but it was unclear whether Rev. Taguchi still was being held. The Taguchis were sent out by the Japan CB Church Association. <BR><B>...Peruvian rebels have been holding a dozen ambassadors</B> and hundreds of other dignitaries. They released 225 of their hostages Sunday night, but not their most strategically important captives, including ambassadors of several Latin American countries, five Peruvian generals, two Peruvian Cabinet members, and Japanese and Peruvian business executives. <BR><B>...Tens of thousands of Peruvians marched through the streets</B> demanding freedom for the hostages and calling for peaceful dialogue. In Lima, a group of evangelists carried a life-size crucifix with a message urging the terrorists to rethink what they are doing, news reports said. <P> <B>A relief group from the National Council of the Churches</B> on Sunday delivered blankets, medical supplies, and powdered milk to several hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq. Church World Service said it had given Iraq relief supplies worth more than $7 million since it started operating in the country six years ago. The group coordinated its activities with Iraq's Red Crescent Society. <P> <B>A Texas appeals court upheld a $1 million jury award against pro-life groups</B> that staged protests at an abortion clinic during the 1992 Republican National Convention. The 14th Court of Appeals in Houston rejected an appeal by Operation Rescue, Rescue America, and two individuals who demonstrated at Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas. Demonstrators carried signs, chanted, prayed, and yelled at people walking into the clinic, violating a court order to keep at least 100 feet away, news reports said. <P> <B>A Taiwanese cult leader contributed to President Clinton's legal defense fund</B>. According to <I>The Washington Post</I>, contributor Ching Hai, the self-styled Supreme Master of Zen, claims she is the living reincarnation of Buddha and Jesus Christ. <I>The Post</I> reported that in Hai's biography, the words &quot;she&quot; and &quot;her&quot; are capitalized because followers consider her to be deity. <I>The Post</I> said Hai also has received congratulatory messages from Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Reagan. <P> <B>A March for Jesus took place earlier this month in Lahore, capital of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan</B>. According to Graham Kendrick, 400 people walked through the city for four hours. A large, brightly decorated truck with a choir, band, and loudspeaker system were at the center of the march. There was singing, public prayer for the nation, preaching, and distribution of thousands of tracts. The march enjoyed cooperation from the police and a general welcome from the public, and was covered by national television. <P> <B>An estimated 1,500 people become Christians every day in China</B> through the ministries of evangelists in the underground churches, according to the <A HREF= http://www.xc.org/brigada/advance/advindex.html ><I>Advance </I>newsletter</A>. With as many as 70 million Christians, Mainland China may rank fifth in Christian population after Russia, Mexico, Brazil, and the United States.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 7, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Candidates tied to the conservative Christian right did well in Tuesday's elections</B>. As a result, the U.S. House and Senate next year will have more Republican lawmakers who are members of conservative Protestant churches in the South's Bible Belt. <BR><B>...The Republican Party has two new U.S. senators in the South,</B> Alabama Attorney General John Sessions and Arkansas Republican Tim Hutchinson. They defeated Democrats after appealing to Christian conservative voters on social issues such as abortion. Republicans lost 16 House seats in the North, but gained new conservative members in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas. <BR><B>...The Christian Coalition said it helped keep Republicans in control of Congress</B>. The group, which distributed 45 million voter guides, said it was instrumental in producing a turnout of conservative Christians that was a record for a presidential election. More than one in four voters nationwide was a self-described born-again Christian, the group said. <BR><B>...Conservative evangelicals were the &quot;firewall that prevented a Bob Dole defeat from mushrooming</B> into a meltdown all the way down the ballot,&quot; coalition leader Ralph Reed said. Despite Dole's loss to President Clinton, the Republican Party increased its 53-47 Senate majority by at least one. The party's 235-197 majority in the House of Representatives was expected to shrink by at least nine seats. <P> <B>For the first time, Ukraine's president will meet with evangelical Christian leaders</B> from other countries. Mission Network News reported that President Leonid Kutchma has invited the leaders next week to the Parliament building. Evangelicals are a minority that have &quot;a very hard time&quot; in Ukraine, and that makes the upcoming meeting an &quot;exciting, unbelievable situation,&quot; said Mikhail Morgulis of Christian Bridge. Morgulis said evangelicals want to cooperate with the government in education, medicine, and humanitarian aid. He said he hopes to introduce Ukraine's leader to the gospel. <P> <B>The Chicago Archdiocese is adamant that a nightclub change its logo</B>, which it calls insulting, <I>The Chicago Sun Times</I> said. The logo -- which features a glowing, bleeding heart wrapped in thorns -- is similar to the Catholic Sacred Heart of God symbol representing the love of Christ for the church. Cardinal Joseph Bernardin called the nightclub logo &quot;an affront to religious expression and belief.&quot; <P> <B>The government of Singapore has set guidelines to regulate political and religious content on the Internet and keep it free of pornography</B>. But members of Parliament question whether a portion of the guidelines aims to stifle political discussion. The government will not allow discussion on the Internet that &quot;tends to bring the government into hatred or contempt, or which excites disaffection against the government,&quot; the guidelines state. Failure to observe the guidelines can result in a fine or cancellation of the license allowing individuals to use the Internet. <P> <B>Malaysia seized watches, toys, key chains, coin boxes</B> and stationery inspired by the Power Rangers children's television show. Authorities from the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry said the show's catch-phrase, &quot;it's morphin time,&quot; could encourage children to use drugs. The items were confiscated from 34 shops in a two-day nationwide operation. Malaysia has drug laws that require the death penalty for those caught with certain quantities of heroin or marijuana. <P> <B>North Korea said it is willing to release Evan Hunziker</B> of Tacoma, Wash., for &quot;humanitarian considerations,&quot; Reuters news service reported. Hunziker was arrested Aug. 24 after crossing China's Yalu River into North Korea, and has been charged as a spy for South Korea. The U.S. and South Korean governments deny that Hunziker, who has been transferred from a hotel to a jail, is a spy. Hunziker's family said he went to China as a missionary and they don't know how he ended up in North Korea. <P> <B>The founder of La Salle University correspondence school in Monroe, La., pleaded guilty</B> on Wednesday to fraud and tax evasion, news reports said. Thomas J. Kirk II of Madisonville, La., faces five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. Sentencing is scheduled for January. <BR><B>...In September, Kirk and the school, which is called World Christian Church,</B> were indicted on charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to commit mail fraud and credit card fraud. According to the indictment, Kirk established the school under the name World Christian Church to avoid government regulation, then set up the Washington, D.C.-based Council on Post-Secondary Christian Education to give the school the appearance of legitimacy. The accreditation agency was a shell corporation controlled by the school, the indictment said. <BR><B>...Under the settlement, the school agreed to bar Kirk</B> from acting as an officer and stop making claims that it is accredited. The school also agreed to forfeit Kirk's $1.5 million mansion and $10.75 million in cash that the government seized.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 27, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Indonesia's President Suharto appealed for unity </B>the<B> </B>day after a mob of Muslim youths set buildings and churches on fire in the West Java town of Tasikmalaya. Hundreds of troops patrolled the town, which was quiet today as Muslims said prayers in the mosques.  <BR><B>...Events leading to the riots started when a student in an Islamic boarding school</B> was punished by his teacher for theft, according to <I>The Straits Times</I>. The student complained to his father, a policeman, who summoned the teacher and other teachers. Several police then allegedly assaulted the three teachers. In response, angry students marched to the police station and burned it down, then stoned stores before turning on the churches, the Indonesian newspaper reported.  <BR><B>...Christian churches as well as car showrooms, banks, and stores owned by ethnic Chinese</B> were the main targets. Thirteen churches and seven schools were burned and at least two people died, including an ethnic Chinese woman carried from a burned-out shop. Rioters scrawled obscenities against the ethnic Chinese, who are seen as dominating the economic life of the town. About 160 people were arrested. <BR><B>...&quot;Religious people should be mature and practice self-restraint</B>, avoiding activities that can create resentment among other people,&quot; Suharto said. While more than 80% of Indonesia's nearly 200 million people are Muslims, the country recognizes all the world's major religions. <BR><B>...The riots, coming one day after Christmas, sent ripples of fear through the Christian community, </B>still shaken after the October burning of 23 churches in East Java. That riot started when a mob formed during the court hearing of a Muslim heretic being tried for blasphemy. Five people were killed and 50 are facing trial for involvement in the rioting.  <P> <B>A new law in Singapore requires grown children to take care of their elderly parents.</B> It provides a legal means for parents over 60 to demand support, and a system of mediation and hearings to resolve claims. <BR><B>...Asian societies have always expected grown children to care for their elderly parents,</B> but in recent years, many parents have been neglected. Since the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents opened in June, it has heard 200 cases, some involving parents who arrived on crutches or in wheelchairs. <BR><B>...This new family problem is a result of social changes</B> in  rapidly modernizing Singapore, where numerous people have moved from poverty to affluence in one generation, <I>The New York Times</I> reported. Singapore also is aging faster than any other Asian nation, and in the next 25 years, a quarter of the population will be over 60.  <P> <B>Two thieves robbed two priests at New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral</B> on Christmas and stole $175, police said. The robbers followed the priests inside the foyer of the cathedral's rectory, located behind the church on Fifth Avenue, a few minutes before midnight on Wednesday. They wished their victims a &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; then fled. <P> <B>Jews in Detroit donated $15,000 to help rebuild a Baptist church in Arkansas</B> that was destroyed by arson. A representative of the Jewish Community Council Arson Relief Fund presented a check to James Frierson of the Fredonia Missionary Baptist Church in West Helena, Ark. The church, built in 1867, and is in one of the poorest counties in the country. <P> <B>An image of the Virgin Mary on the windows of the Seminole Finance Corp. office building in Clearwater, Fla.,</B> has drawn a half million people in the past two weeks. The crowds necessitated around-the-clock traffic control, news reports said. Officials had hoped the crowds would thin after Christmas, but several hundred people gathered Thursday to pray and sing. The base of the building is littered with flowers, candles, pictures, and notes. People have left cash, credit cards, food stamps, diamond rings, and passes to Walt Disney World. A spokesman said the Catholic Archdiocese does not plan to inspect the image and urged people to &quot;exercise a great deal of healthy skepticism.&quot; <P> <B>The leader of the world's 300 million Orthodox Christians </B>will make his first pastoral visit to the United States Oct. 20 to Nov. 9, 1997. Ecumenical Patriarch Batholomew I of Constantinople will stop in New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.   <P> <B>The composer of the classic <I>Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas</I> has changed the song's lyrics</B> to reflect his Christian faith. Hugh Martin, 82, was not a Christian when he wrote the tune for <I>Meet Me In St. Louis</I>, a 1943 movie starring Judy Garland. Now, Martin's Seventh-day Adventist faith means everything to him, he said.    </font></p>

Suma Ching Hai, leader of Ching Hai, the group that follows her teachings, learned of Clinton's troubles during a prayer meeting with Charles Yah Lin Trie, an Arkansas businessman. Trie is one of Summa Ching Hai's followers and an initiate into the sect, she told the <I>Riverside Press Enterprise</I>.  <BR><B>...After the meeting with Trie, Hai gave lectures in the United States</B> during which she urged her followers to contribute generously to Clinton's defense fund. Clinton is &quot;the president of the United States, the biggest country in the world, and yet he is dragged into the material world by something so trivial,&quot; she told the <I>Times</I>. <BR> <B>...Many of the contributions appeared to be bogus</B>, reports said. Some donors appeared unable to afford their $1,000 gifts, some check signatures had identical handwriting, and sequentially numbered money orders arrived from people in different cities, reports said.  <BR><B>...The Ching Hai sect claims about 100,000 followers around the world. </B>Its practices resemble those of Buddhism, and followers compare Suma Ching Hai, 46, to Buddha and Jesus Christ. A temple is located in Lake Elsinore, Calif.  <P> <B>Detroit will ring in a new tradition as more than 100 church bells peel at midnight</B>. Individuals also are being encouraged to ring hand-held bells at midnight. <BR><B>...The bells are meant to drown out the sound of gunfire</B>. Each New Year's Eve, thousands of bullets are fired randomly into the sky. Bullets fired into the air can fall at 600 feet per second, piercing cars and buildings. Last year, one bullet killed a woman. Church groups also will be holding prayer meetings tonight for peace. <P> <B>A group that opposes abortion has sued after being denied permission to demonstrate</B> on the sidewalk along the route of President Clinton's inaugural parade. The Christian Defense Coalition claims its free-speech rights are being violated. It has asked the National Park Service for permission to assemble with signs along a one-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue. The coalition did receive permission to demonstrate at two other sites away from the parade route. <P> <B>Ambassador University will close in May</B>. The school's board of regents voted to shut down the 50-year-old school because of declining enrollment and funding cuts from the Worldwide Church of God, UPI reported. Officials hope to sell the campus in Big Sandy, Texas, which has 650 students. The Worldwide Church of God and Ambassador University were established by Herbert W. Armstrong, father of evangelist Garner Ted Armstrong. In recent years, the Church has undergone major changes, becoming more evangelical in its theology. The changes caused a split in the denomination, resulting in  losses of membership and revenue. <P> <B>An expedition to the Antarctic</B> will bring together young people from several countries that are in conflict in a bid to foster mutual trust. The 35-member team from 26 countries includes a Palestinian and an Israeli, a Catholic and Protestant from Northern Ireland, and a black and white South African, Reuter news service reported. Others on the trip, which is sponsored by the United Nations cultural organization, have overcome problems with drugs or alcohol. <P> <B>The Albanian Bible Institute was dedicated in Durres, Albania, recently</B>. ABI is supported by Greater Europe Mission, European Christian Mission, and Ancient World Outreach. Fifteen students are enrolled. <P> <B>A retired Russian Army colonel is appealing to American Christians</B> to send Russian-language editions of the New Testament to Russian soldiers. Yevgeny Ivanovich Khatyushin, who was baptized in 1993, has made 17 fund-raising tours of the United States, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reported. He tells audiences that the political climate in Russia is precarious and that, in a crisis, soldiers who are Christians would more likely promote democracy than Communism. Khatyushin's trips to the United States are sponsored by Revival Fire Ministries of Branson, Mo., which said he has raised $500,000 and provided 900,000 paperback copies of the Bible to Russian soldiers.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 2, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem</B>, built above the traditional tomb of Jesus Christ, dedicated its new rotunda today. Leaders of the Greek Orthodox, Latin, and Armenian Churches, who are custodians of the church, presided over the ceremony. <BR><B>...The design in the rotunda, by California artist Era Normart</B>, depicts 12 streams of gold representing the 12 Apostles. Three rays of light, symbolizing the Trinity, branch down from each stream. George Doty of New York City donated the funds for the renovations, which cost about $2 million. The church was built in 1042 on the ruins of the original church, built in 335 by Roman Emperor Constantine. <P> <B>Scientists proved that the Jewish priesthood has been passed down for thousands of years.</B> A study showed Y-chromosome composition was similar in 188 unrelated members of the priesthood from Israel, North America, and Britain. This suggests a common origin, supporting biblical accounts dating the Jewish priesthood back 3,300 years. <BR><B>...The scientists -- from the Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine</B> and Research Institute in Haifa, the University College in London, and the University of Arizona -- said they determined who were members of the priesthood by questioning them about their family background. Male Jews who can claim descent through their fathers from the priesthood are known as the Cohanim or Cohens and have certain social and religious obligations. Subjects who were not sure of their designation or who identified themselves as Levite, a separate priesthood with a less-well-defined patrilineal lineage, were not included. <P> <B>President and Mrs. Clinton marked the New Year</B> by attending the Renaissance Weekend, an invitation-only conclave of high achievers in finance, religion, politics, and science. The Clintons have attended the gathering nearly every New Year's since the early 1980s.  <BR><B>...The Clintons led a seminar, taking questions</B> such as: What were the three worst mistakes of your first term? What would be on your gravestone if you could write your own epitaph? What one power would you want as president that you don't have now? Clinton did not reveal his answers to reporters, news reports said. The Clintons also attended a seminar titled<I> Spiritual Life in a Secular Society</I>.  <BR><B>...The president said he regretted the increasing size of the gathering</B>. From gatherings with no more than 200 families in attendance, the event has grown to include 500 families, or 1,600 people. Tony Campolo and other well known evangelicals also attended. <P> <B>An album of 20 hymns from the Roman Catholic church's past</B> is selling fast in Ireland. Since its release on Oct. 21, <I>Faith of Our Fathers: Classic Religious Anthems of Ireland </I>has sold 150,000 copies and has been the best-selling record for five weeks. <BR><B>...The album strikes a sentimental chord</B> in a society where the church's hold is waning and attendance at Mass has fallen, observers said. The hymns &quot;were inbred in us but died out with all the changes in the 1960s. They're deeply resonant for Irish people,&quot; said producer John Kearns.  <P> <B>Two firebombs were thrown at an abortion clinic in Tulsa, Okla.,</B> Wednesday, causing minor smoke and fire damage. No one was inside the building, which was closed for the holiday. Sherri Finik, director of the Reproductive Services clinic, called the attack &quot;an act of futility and stupidity&quot; and said the clinic would remain open. <P> <I><B>Penthouse</B></I><B> magazine asked a federal judge to allow pornography</B> to be sold on military bases until a lawsuit over the issue is resolved. Publisher Bob Guccione's suit challenges a part of the Military Honor and Decency Act that prohibits sale or rental of sexually explicit materials at base commissaries and exchanges. He argues that the ban  amounts to censorship and is unconstitutional. Adult magazines account for 20% of magazine sales on bases. <BR><B>...Penthouse is being joined in the suit</B> by the International Periodical Distributors Association, the National Association of Recording Merchandisers, the Periodical and Book Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, and the Video Software Dealers Association, news reports said. <BR><B>...Backers of the ban say the government should not sell</B> sexually explicit material in taxpayer-subsidized base stores, particularly when children of military families shop in the facilities. <P> <B>Baptists in Kenya have started one church and had 130 people baptized every week</B>, on average, for the past 40 years, according to a Kenyan Baptist leader. &quot;I myself am a product of a Southern Baptist missionary preaching in a marketplace,&quot; Samson Kisia, moderator of the Kenya Baptist Convention, told Baptist Press.  <BR><B>...Missionary work in Kenya has been difficult</B> <B>but rewarding,</B> he said. Work began when Kenya was fighting its war of independence, and many people have &quot;sacrificed their work, health, and lives&quot; to serve Christ, he said. <BR><B>...&quot;Now it is harvest time in Kenya</B>. Many people are coming to Jesus, and Kenya Baptists are working shoulder-to-shoulder with Southern Baptists to carry the gospel to every person in Kenya before the year 2000,&quot; he said. <P> <B>An attorney who worked alongside Hillary Clinton</B> for five years at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., now is a master of divinity student at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky. Sam Strange, 33, left a successful law practice earlier this year, Baptist Press said. Other Rose Law Firm attorneys whom Strange worked with included Vincent Foster Jr., the late deputy White House counsel who committed suicide in 1993; Webster Hubbell, a former Justice Department counsel; and William Kennedy III, who served for a time in the White House travel office.  <BR><B>...Strange said that before his conversion he thought he had everything</B>, but still felt sad and lonely. He began attending a Bible study with his sister. Strange became a Christian, and was increasingly dedicated to service in the church.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 4, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Church property is being contested in a divorce court</B>. Evangelist Robert Tilton's first and second wives both are arguing that his Word of Faith church in Farmer's Branch, Texas, is Tilton's personal property since he controls it with no outside, formal advisors. Word of Faith has no elders, deacons, or finance committee. The women want the court to break up Word of Faith property and give them shares. State District Judge Bill Burdock refused to drop the church from the current divorce case, ruling that there is no separation between it and Tilton. <BR><B>...Burdock's ruling has &quot;potentially very dangerous implications</B> for the way churches conduct their business,&quot; Lonnie Kliever, chairman of the religion department at Southern Methodist University, told The Associated Press. The property ruling, which apparently is unprecedented, raises questions about the relationship between church leaders and church property, he said. <P> <B>Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey prayed at the tomb of St. Peter at the Vatican</B> on Wednesday. Carey, who heads the 70-million member Anglican Communion, also visited the crypt where modern popes are buried. <BR><B>...Pope John Paul II and Carey both emphasized unity</B>. &quot;We cannot undo overnight the doctrinal differences and bitterness that have resulted from the legacy of history, but we are able to confront them as fellow Christians,&quot; Carey said. The two churches split in 1534 when King Henry VIII broke with Rome over papal authority. They still are divided over the question, and also have hit a stumbling block over women priests. <P> <B>The Florida murder trial of five teen-agers is casting a spotlight on an underground vampire culture</B> that has evolved from the game <I>Vampire: The Masquerade</I>. In the game, which has sold 500,000 copies since its 1991 creation, participants dress up like vampires and act out vampire roles at night on city streets. <BR><B>...<I>Vampire: The Masquerade,</I> which is patterned after <I>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</I></B>, is now second in popularity only to D&amp;D, according to its publisher, White Wolf , Inc., of Atlanta. Serious players belong to clans, and women submit to sires; some less serious players say it is all harmless fun. <BR><B>...The teen-agers in the Florida trial are suspected in the bludgeoning deaths </B>of the parents of one of the teens, 15-year-old Heather Wendorf. Police say all the teens were heavily involved in the game, and eventually some players began drinking their own blood and that of mutilated animals. <P> <B>Paul Freed, 78, founder and president of Trans World Radio, died Dec. 1</B> after a long battle with heart problems. Freed founded the international broadcasting ministry in 1952 in Tangier before moving Trans World Radio to Monte Carlo seven years later. <P> <B>Western missionaries should stop their aggressive proselytizing techniques</B>, speakers said at a World Council of Churches conference this week in Salvador, Brazil. Indigenous groups complained that the missionaries destroyed their cultures, replacing them with Western ideas. Russian Orthodox leaders at the conference criticized evangelization methods used by foreign missionaries after the collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.  <BR><B>...Western mission agencies should apologize for destroying indigenous cultures</B>, according to one missionary leader from the United States. David Hirano of the United Church of Christ Board for Global Ministries, whose father was converted by Congregational missionaries in Hawaii, praised the UCC for apologizing to native Hawaiians. Christian missionaries &quot;did some good things,&quot; but the native population of Hawaii &quot;was destroyed by Christian missionaries,&quot; he said.  <P> <B>Sixteen former Anglican priests recently returned to the Church of England</B>. The priests had left after the church began ordaining women, <I>The Times</I> of London reported. They have received permission to again conduct Anglican services. Eight of the 16 had joined the Roman Catholic Church. According to <I>The Times</I>, 391 Church of England clergy resigned over the ordination of women priests. Two hundred twenty-one have become Catholics, 22 Orthodox, nine have joined the Free churches, and the others have remained in the Anglican church, although they do not serve as clergy. <P> <B>A Christian radio station in Lebanon is throwing a Christmas party,</B> including food and gifts, for Lebanese and Israeli children. The children will remember that they had fun with others different from themselves, said George Otis, president of Voice of Hope radio. The station arranged for Israeli Defense Force personnel to pick up the children in buses, Otis told Mission News Network. This demonstrates &quot;the humanity of the Jewish people, that they're not all just firing guns all the time, that they're nice people.&quot;  <P> <B>Super Bowl Sunday will also be &quot;Souper Bowl&quot; day</B> at churches of numerous denominations around the country. On that day, volunteers will ask for a $1 donation from everyone present at their services. The money will be used to help feed hungry people in communities in any manner the local church decides is appropriate, such as contributing to a shelter or buying groceries for a food pantry. Souper Bowl, which was begun in 1990 by youth groups in Columbia, S.C., has raised $2 million in six years. Organizers ask that participants report totals by calling a toll free number. A brochure explaining Souper Bowl is available from at (800) 358-SOUP.     </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 27, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Two hundred thousand people filed solemnly through Belgrade, Yugoslavia</B>, today in a march called by the Serbian Orthodox church.  The church is siding with demonstrators, who have been protesting for two months against election fraud.  Patriarch Pavle, head of the Church, who is in his 80s, led the procession.  He was flanked by 20 chanting priests, all of whom walked two miles to celebrate mass at the Temple of Saint Sava.  At the head of one column, marchers carried two Serbian flags, a statue of Christ, and a candle. <P> <B>At least $1,176,000 was raised at churches across the United States for hungry people</B> yesterday during &quot;Souper Bowl Sunday.&quot; During the annual campaign, churches collect money in soup kettles and report to a toll-free number so amounts can be tallied.  The money is donated to local charities.  The annual campaign was begun in 1990 by Brad Smith, pastor of Spring Valley Presbyterian Church in Columbia, S.C. <P> <B>Pakistani authorities released five Christians implicated in a letter</B> that contains language against Mohammed and a threat to blow up a mosque.  Police said they knew the five Christians, locked up for 12 days in Chichawatni, were innocent, a fact confirmed by handwriting tests.  Police had wanted them to suggest names of their enemies who may have written the letter.   <BR><B>...Another case of alleged blasphemy </B>has been filed against a Christian in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, identified only as Nelson, <I>Compass Direct</I> news service reported.  The accused, said to be a stenographer, was arrested Jan. 4, imprisoned without bail, and charged with burning pages of the Koran, found partially destroyed in his wastepaper basket.  A Christian group is trying to find a lawyer to take the case; pressure from Islamic extremists has put lawyers and judges in danger when they get involved in such cases. <P> <B>Religious freedom in Russia is declining</B>, the Moscow correspondent for Oxford, England-based Keston News Service told a U.S. commission last week.  &quot;In religious freedom as in many other areas of life, Russia is to a large extent a lawless state,&quot; Lawrence Uzzell told the U.S. Commission for Security and Cooperation In Europe.  Freedom of worship has been in decline, mostly for non-Russian Orthodox minorities, Uzzell said.  He recommended that Western nations pressure Russia's leaders to guarantee freedom of worship before their nation can be integrated into Europe and the West.   <BR><B>...A member of Russian President Yeltsin's staff proposed a special status</B> for Russia's &quot;traditional religions.&quot; Andrei Loginov sent the proposal to an informal task force of the parliament in December.  The head of the independent Institute of Religion and Law in Moscow told a Jan. 22 press conference that four faiths suggested as Russia's &quot;traditional religions&quot; are the Orthodox Church, Judaism, Islam and Buddhism.  The next step could be to create privileges for the &quot;traditional&quot; faiths and disadvantages for all others, he said. <P> <B>Chechen police rescued an abducted Russian Orthodox priest</B> and his assistant two weeks after they were abducted by gunmen in Grozny.  Father Yefimi and his assistant, Alexei Ravilov, were taken prisoner Jan. 9 by gunmen in the Muslim-dominated southern Russian republic, Ecumenical News International reported.  Russians consider the abduction of Orthodox officials in Chechenya as part of hostilities between Russia and Chechenya.  The Chechen rebels have proclaimed their allegiance to Islam, in contrast to the Russia's predominantly Orthodox Christian population.   <P> <B>The U.S. State Department will criticize Germany</B> for restrictions on the Church of Scientology, the <I>Washington Post</I> said.  The department's annual survey of global human rights conditions, to be issued Wednesday, will chastise Germany for &quot;a campaign of harassment and intimidation&quot; against the church.  An official said the United States had urged Germany &quot;not to prosecute people for wrong thinking,&quot; but has been rebuffed.  A German diplomat said Germany cannot afford to &quot;have militias and cults&quot; and must limit groups perceived as threats to its national well-being. <P> <B>Muslims, Catholics, Protestants, and Jews in a southern French town</B> are uniting to oppose racism.  About 300 people from the four religious communities in Vitrolles, near Marseilles, held a &quot;proclamation and prayer&quot; meeting Jan. 21, 12 days before municipal elections in the town, Ecumenical News International reported.  Speakers asked voters to reject the extremist National Front party, which has been targeting North Africans.  The groups plan to hold regular joint meetings. <P> <B>Hawaii's state House overwhelmingly approved a proposal banning same-sex marriage</B> last week.  The proposed constitutional amendment is expected to win quick approval in the state Senate, then go before voters in November 1998.  Hawaiian lawmakers are trying to get around last year's state court order to license same-sex marriages. <P> <B>Astrologer Jeane Dixon died Saturday from a heart attack at age 79</B>.  Her syndicated column is published by more than 800 newspapers worldwide.  Dixon rose to national prominence with her prediction in a 1956 <I>Parade</I> magazine article that a tall young man with blue eyes and thick brown hair would be elected to the presidency in 1960 and would die in office in 1963.  She wrote a series of books including<I> My Life and Prophecies,</I> <I>Reincarnation and Prayers to Live By,</I> and <I>Jeane Dixon's Astrological Cookbook.</I> <P> <B>Only 34% of 200 Anglican priests could recite all 10 Commandments</B> when polled by the <I>Sunday Times</I> of London.  The poll found that most clergy knew the commandments prohibiting adultery and coveting one's neighbor's wife, but were unsure about the other eight.  &quot;When people are put on the spot like this of course they can't remember,&quot; a Church of England spokesman said.  John Redwood, a Conservative Member of  Parliament, said he was amazed at the clergy's ignorance.  &quot;It's their job to remind us of the laws of Christianity,&quot; he told the Associated Press.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 21, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>China plans to reimpose laws restricting the rights of protest</B> and free association in Hong Kong.  Legislation submitted Sunday to China's rubber-stamp Parliament requires protest demonstrations in Hong Kong to be approved in advance by police, and all organizations to be certified by the government.   <BR><B>...The legislation is a &quot;very strong step backward,&quot;</B> according to Ho Hei-wah, chairman of the Hong Kong Human Rights Commission, an umbrella group for a dozen religious, social service, and human rights groups.  Rights advocates expect the proposed laws to be the first of a series.  Sixteen of Hong Kong's laws, including several major provisions of the Bill of Rights, are to be repealed when China regains control of the territory in July.   <P> <B>A former substitute teacher who says he was fired for discussing religion with students</B> lost an appeal in the U.S. Supreme Court today.  The court rejected Peter Helland's argument that the firing violated his religious freedom.  Helland was a substitute teacher in South Bend, Ind., public schools.  His termination letter said his discussion of religion and evolution upset students.  He had been warned about injecting religion into his classroom presentations, failing to follow lesson plans, and problems with classroom management, news reports said.   <BR><B>...The court also said today that a Topeka, Kan., church</B> whose members regularly picket against homosexuality must continue to limit its demonstrations outside another church's building.  The court upheld a protest-buffer zone outside St. David's Episcopal Church.  Members of Westboro Baptist Church have picketed outside St. David's in what they call a &quot;God Hates Fags&quot; campaign.  In 1995, Westboro Baptist pastor Fred Phelps and his followers picketed a gay pride parade in San Francisco.  &quot;The whole thing is calculated to warn this evil city that they're going the way of Sodom,&quot; Phelps said.   <P> <B>Jurors awarded $3.7 million to seven women</B> who accused Barry Bailey, former pastor of First United Methodist Church in Fort Worth, Texas, of sexual misconduct.  Most of the women were church employees or members.  The largest award, $1.3 million, went to Ginger Pierson, a former staff and church member who said Bailey, 70, turned a counseling relationship that began when she was 16 into a 10-year sexual relationship.   <P> <B>Mozambique's churches are taking an active part in the country's disarmament</B>.  The Weapons to Ploughshares project offers to swap weapons for something useful for rebuilding the country, such as a sewing machine,  spade, or hoe.  According to Fergus MacDonald of the Scottish Bible Society, the exchange rate for a tractor is 500 weapons.  People bring weapons and bombs into the churches, which destroy them. The government often lends technical help.   <P> <B>Two hundred prisoners made professions of faith</B> and enrolled in correspondence Bible study courses in Thailand's Ratchburi Prison after a gospel presentation recently, according to Baptist Press.   <P> <B>Promise Keepers Canada will hold six major conferences for men this year.  </B>The theme for the meetings is &quot;The Making of A Godly Man.&quot;  The schedule includes: May 10, Moncton, New Brunswick; June 14, Hamilton, Ontario; July 12, Montreal, Quebec; Aug. 23, Winnipeg, Manitoba; Sept. 13, Vancouver, British Columbia; and Oct. 25, Edmonton, Alberta. <BR><B>...PK Canada also will hold Clergy Summits for pastors and church leaders</B> two months before each conference, with leadership seminars for pastors and lay leaders shortly afterward. <P> <B>Poland and the United States are cooperating </B>in a project to build a Holocaust memorial on the site of a Nazi extermination camp at Belzec, near Lublin in eastern Poland.  Belzec was the first place the Nazis erected permanent gas chambers, beginning a decisive phase in the Final Solution, the Nazi plan to kill all of Europe's Jews.  An estimated 600,000 Jews died at Belzec.  There is a small memorial on the site, but it is falling apart from neglect.  Participating in the project are the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and the state-run Council for the Protection of the Memory of Combat and Martyrdom in Poland. <P> <B>Twenty-seven people died from drinking bootleg liquor in Hyderabad, Pakistan.  </B>Doctors said the victims arrived at a hospital in critical condition, but were reluctant to admit that they had consumed illegally distilled liquor because they could be flogged under Pakistan's Islamic laws.  Violating the ban on alcohol is considered a more serious sin in the holy month of Ramadan, now under way.      </font></p>

The conference, organized by the Serbian Evangelical Alliance, received positive coverage in television and print media, according to Lazar Stojsic, president of the Evangelical Alliance in Belgrade. <P> <B>Swiss Christians are praying for revival in their country,</B> where many people have fallen away from the church and are indifferent to it. Some 450 leaders of various denominations met in Zurich Sept. 21 to confess their failings and exhort one another to use creative means for evangelism. The gathering was the largest such meeting of its kind, its organizers, FocuSuisse, told Discipling A Whole Nation. <BR><B>...About 120 Christians from various churches held a prayer march along the German border</B> near Schaffhausen on Sept. 15. The aim was to repent for Switzerland's return of fleeing Jews to Nazi Germany and for Swiss arrogance towards Germany, said Ramu Bhalla, leader of a Schaffhausen church. <P> <B>Pope John Paul had his appendix removed Tuesday in an operation that found no sign of a tumor</B> or other serious illness, chief surgeon Francesco Crucitti said. The Pope, 76, showed no ill effects from the  50-minute operation, which did not reveal a recurrence of the tumor Crucitti removed from the Pope's colon in 1992. <P> <B>The AIDS epidemic is more diverse in the United States than previously thought</B>, scientists say. In 1994, doctors in France found a hard-to-diagnose strain of AIDS, named Group O.<B> </B>The strain previously was found only in West Africa. Last July, doctors found the first Group O case in the United States. Then last month, scientists found a second U.S. resident infected with this rare type of HIV. Researchers also are investigating several New York City residents who have signs of still another AIDS strain never before seen in the United States. <BR><B>...Researchers are looking for AIDS strains worldwide to ensure that tests for HIV are able to detect</B> every type of the disease. HIV tests are designed to detect a region's most common strains, but doctors are increasingly concerned whether they will catch rare, foreign strains. <P> <B>The Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg, Fla., is reeling from a series of revelations</B> involving marriage, homosexuality, and sexual abuse, United Press International said. The incidents involve three priests: <BR><B>...On Oct. 1, Patrick Clarke, 62, pastor of Espiritu Santu parish</B> in Safety Harbor, had married a woman in a civil ceremony in 1981. Clarke is on paid leave, UPI said. <BR><B>...The next day, it was revealed that Rev. Simeon Gardner, 69, had diverted $220,000</B> in church funds for  three years to a man with whom he had &quot;improper and impermissible sexual conduct,&quot; the diocese said. <BR><B>...Two days later, the diocese confirmed that Rev. William Lau of St. Petersburg</B> is on leave of absence and undergoing counseling after a complaint by a man alleging sexual misconduct had occurred &quot;many years prior.&quot; <P> <B>Roderick Wright, the Catholic Bishop of Argyll, said he will marry Kathleen Macphee</B>, the divorced mother of three with whom he ran away. Wright's resignation and disappearance three weeks ago shocked the Church in Scotland. He also said he would have to accept the fact that after 32 years as a priest he would never say Mass again. <P> <B>The United States warned Taleban Islamic rulers in Kabul that they risk forfeiting war-reconstruction aid</B> for Afghanistan if they continue to restrict women's rights. Since the Taleban movement captured Kabul two weeks ago, it has prohibited women from working. <BR><B>...United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali also warned Taleban rulers</B> that the U.N. objects to the extreme discrimination they practice against women. He warned of  &quot;serious repercussions&quot; for the foreign aid programs there, the <I>New York Times</I> said. The U.N., working with a large number of  relief organizations, is the most important source of aid to Afghanistan. <P> <B>The United States will send a senior official to South Korea as tensions rise</B> over the intrusion of a North Korean submarine and North Korea's arrest of a Christian missionary on spy charges, news reports said. Washington has demanded that North Korea free Evan Carl Hunzike, 26, a Christian missionary and U.S. citizen arrested Oct. 6 on charges of spying for South Korea . <BR><B>...The purpose of the American diplomat's trip is to reassure South Korea</B>, an official said. South Korean newspapers have accused President Clinton of  appeasing North Korea to keep peace on the Korean peninsula at any cost before November's presidential elections. <P> <B>American cities and suburbs have reported dramatic increases in heroin usage and deaths</B> in the past 1 1/2 years, news report say. Some studies estimate the number of heroin addicts in the United States at 1 million. Heroin is increasingly popular among young people since it is being glamorized by rock musicians, it is more available, and cheaper than in the past, experts say. <P> <B>British clergy are being taught to cope with drunks, drug addicts, and thieves</B> who increasingly come to their doorsteps demanding money, <I>The London Times</I> said. A number of conferences throughout the country address the problem. Clergy and their wives face growing threats of violence from beggars, many of whom are mentally ill or want money for drugs.  <BR><B>...Clergy also are under threat from the public</B>. As respect for the church has declined, clerics sometimes are bullied and intimidated by the public, <I>The Times</I> said. The Christian command to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; means many are unwilling or do not know how to fight, <I>The Times</I> said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 20, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Pope John Paul's visit to Cuba next year is a big gamble for Fidel Castro</B>. Despite three decades of a  communist regime, Cuba still is deeply Catholic, with 40% of the island's residents practicing the faith. Even when the government shuts off electricity during the evening to conserve energy, Masses continue by candlelight. <BR><B>...Castro faces the risk that the Pope could become a rallying point</B> for opponents in and outside Cuba. Yet he wants the Pope's help in fighting a 34-year-old U.S. trade embargo. The Pope wants new Catholic schools, permission to send in priests from around the world, and the right to expand Catholic charity work on the island. When Castro first took power, he confiscated Church property, closed Church schools, and expelled hundreds of priests. <P> <B>The Ku Klux Klan sued a sheriff</B>, charging that his deputies tried to run Klansmen out of the country. The Christian Knights of the KKK and two leaders sued Hoyt Collins of Clarendon County, S.C., for $200,000 saying deputies threatened them, sent spies to meetings, and disrupted rallies. Former members of the group have been charged with burning black churches, the Associated Press said. <BR><B>...&quot;The people who have the worst things to say still have a right to say them,&quot;</B> said Gary White, attorney for the Klan group. Tom Turnipseed, lawyer for a church that was burned last year, said it was ridiculous for &quot;a terrorist organization that has done what they have done to people&quot; to complain about law enforcement. <P> <B>U.N. agencies and the Red Cross in Central Africa are giving &quot;morning after&quot; pills</B> and condoms to refugees as part of a family-planning campaign that includes care for women in childbirth or who have had miscarriages or self-induced abortions. The campaign was begun by organizations and charities, but a new $500,000 U.N.-funded program is being organized to coordinate efforts to assist Rwandan refugees returning home, as well as those still trapped in Zaire. <P> <B>The National Association of Evangelicals -- founded in 1942 in opposition</B> to the liberalism of the mainline denominations -- is improving relations with more liberal and moderate churches. Last week's address by NAE head Don Argue to the National Council of Churches was met by a standing ovation. Argue said he has developed a good relationship with NCC leader Joan Brown Campbell, working with her on causes such as religious liberty. <BR><B>...The NAE leader said he had no difficulty recognizing NCC leaders as fellow Christians,</B> he told Ecumenical Press International. The NAE, which includes 48 denominations, individual congregations from 10 other denominations, and more than 250 parachurch ministries and schools, does not include such prominent conservatives as Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson, ENI said. <BR><B>...&quot;I think it is very unfortunate that in the Christian Coalition, Pat Robertson has politicized</B> the words 'Christian' and 'evangelical,' &quot; Argue said. The NAE leader said he wanted to depoliticize the words and &quot;develop a position that is neither Republican nor Democratic.&quot; <P> <B>Some Russian broadcast frequencies, formerly used for government propaganda</B>, have been given free of charge to a British Christian broadcasting group. According to journalist Dan Wooding, United Christian Broadcasters of Europe, based in Hanchurch, Stoke on Trent, England, will use the frequencies to present Christian programming throughout Europe. The UCB signal is transmitted 24 hours a day on Astra Satellite with SKY Sports (channel 20) on audio sound frequency 7.56MHZ. <P> <B>The Church of England is considering buying shares in breweries</B> so it can exert more influence against under-age drinking, <I>The London Times</I> reported.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 9, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>The nation's second-largest Baptist university is defending its president, Kirby Godsey, against heresy charges</B>. Trustees at Mercer University in Macon, Ga., unanimously adopted a resolution Dec. 5 supporting Godsey, who has been criticized by Georgia Baptists over his book <I>When We Talk About God...Let's Be Honest</I>. In September, the Georgia Baptist Convention's executive committee asked the school's trustees to respond to concerns about the book. Messengers at the state convention's annual meeting in November endorsed the executive committee's request.  <BR><B>...Among controversial issues are Godsey's view that the Bible should not be taken literally,</B> and his questions about traditional church teachings such as original sin and the Virgin Birth. Mercer trustees said Godsey's book has had &quot;no adverse effect&quot; on the university's educational mission, Associated Baptist Press reported. Mercer officials said they do not want to sever ties with Georgia Baptists but intend to protect the school's academic freedom.  <BR><B>...Godsey said he has no intention of recanting,</B> although he might state some views differently, ABP said. The book is &quot;about my own journey of belief. It is a very candid, open statement not meant to be imposed on anyone else.&quot;  <P> <B>An evangelical revival is reportedly occurring at a private school outside Windsor, England.</B> Led by an alumnus, students at Eton school are organizing &quot;alternative services&quot; during which students are lining up to become Christians, according to Discipling a Whole Nation. Upper-class churches near the school also are becoming evangelical. <P> <B>Seventh-day Adventist evangelist Merrill Enright wore seven layers of clothing</B> as he conducted a series of  meetings in frozen Beltzi, Moldova. There was no heat or running water, and no indoor restrooms; electricity was unreliable, and much of the crusade was conducted in the dark, he told Adventist News Network. An average of 700 people attended the meetings, which included a slide show in Russian, health talks, and storytelling for children; 180 people were baptized. <BR><B>...&quot;The sense of hopelessness is everywhere. It is very gray</B>. <B>It is a dangerous time there,&quot;</B> Enright said.  Foreign businessmen are &quot;fair game for kidnapping by criminal Russian groups&quot; because they can be held for ransom. After Enright learned of a kidnapping plot against him, church elders and ministers guarded him.   <P> <B>Christians United for Reformation is moving to Philadelphia</B> from Anaheim, Calif. CURE publishes <I>Modern Reformation</I> magazine and broadcasts the syndicated radio program <I>The White Horse Inn</I>. CURE claims that the doctrine of justification &quot;lies rotting in a corner in the basement, ignored amidst the excitements of church growth strategies, user-friendly sermons, and the self-help gospels of pop-psychology.&quot; The new address for Christians United For Reformation is P.O. Box 2000, Philadelphia, PA 19103-8440, 215/546-3696, Fax: 215/735-5133. <P> <B>An album by two contemporary Christian musicians is receiving criticism.</B> When Michael Card, an evangelical, and John Michael Talbot, a Roman Catholic, made an album together, they thought they were simply celebrating their shared faith, Religion News Service said. While the album has been applauded by some, others have opposed what they consider its ecumenical statement. A Protestant church in Arizona  canceled their September concert, and the evangelical publication <I>Moody Magazine</I>, which has long covered Card's music, declined to advertise the joint album, <I>Brother to Brother</I> (Myrrh Records). In October, a Protestant church in Toronto canceled a solo concert scheduled by Talbot.  <BR><B>...Talbot was surprised at the &quot;furor of the anti-Catholicism</B> <B>which we encountered,&quot;</B> he said. In a written statement, Card said, &quot;there are some beliefs within orthodox Catholicism that I cannot agree to,&quot; but Protestants can learn from the Catholic emphasis on &quot;mystery and prayer.&quot;  <P> <B>Prostitutes in southeast Asia are receiving Christian compassion</B>. Singapore's World Outreach has started Rahab Ministries, a hairdressing salon that also offers Christian counseling. As a result, nearly 50 women have left prostitution, according to Mission Network News. <P> <B>An influential Israeli rabbi issued an edict this week ordering mailmen to burn &quot;satanic&quot; promotional literature</B> sent by Christian missionary groups, the Israeli newspaper <I>Haaretz</I> reported. Jewish mailmen must destroy the Christian pamphlets, even at the risk of losing their jobs, said Rabbi Ovadia Yossef, spiritual leader of the Sephardic ultra-Orthodox party Shas. Yossef  issued the ruling after the missionary group Peace sent thousands of promotional pamphlets to Israelis, the <I>Houston Chronicle</I> reported. A spokesman for the postal authority said several mailmen had been assaulted for delivering the Christian pamphlets in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. <P> <B>Some 450,000 children of prisoners nationwide will receive Christmas gifts</B> this year through the Angel Tree Project, an annual ministry of Prison Fellowship. More than a million volunteers nationwide will deliver the gifts. Angel Tree also runs a summer camping program that aims to rebuild relationships between children and their absent parents and between families and their communities. A choir of children who have received Christmas gifts and support through the Angel Tree program recorded the album <I>An Angel Tree Christmas</I>, which is being sold in bookstores.     </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 13, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Jewish and Christian congregations in Waterloo, Ontario, have built a worship center they will share.</B> The Cedars House has a roof that peaks at both ends above each congregation's sanctuary, <I>The Christian Science Monitor</I> reported. Between the two is a folding wall, which is removable for extra seating when either congregation needs it. The Jewish congregation worships on Saturdays and the Westminister United Church of Canada on Sundays. <BR><B>...The project started when two neighbors</B> who are members of their congregations' building committees chatted about their plans. &quot;This all started out as a bricks and mortar thing and it ended up being a people thing. We've developed some good friendships,&quot; pastor Gary Boratto said. <P> <B>Two million people packed the shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe</B> outside Mexico City Thursday for the anniversary of what church tradition says was her appearance in 1531 to the peasant Juan Diego. Priests from Mexico, the United States, Canada, and as far away as Argentina took part in the celebration inside the modern basilica. The Virgin is credited with bringing Roman Catholicism to Mexico's indigenous population. Today, about 90% of Mexico's 90 million residents are Catholic. <BR><B>...Some academics consider Guadalupe an invention of the Spaniards</B> to convert the indigenous population to Catholicism. Guillermo Schulenburg, the abbot who oversaw the basilica for three decades, resigned in September amid a national scandal over his reported doubts about the tradition. <P> <B>Saudi Arabia beheaded a Syrian man by the sword today for practicing witchcraft</B>, state-run Saudi television reported. The court cited the dangerous effect witchcraft could have on individuals and society. The beheading, in the capital Riyadh, raised to 63 the number of  people executed this year. Convicted murderers, drug smugglers, rapists, and other criminals also are beheaded in the conservative Islamic kingdom. <P> <B>The miracles reported in the Bible may have had foundation in scientific fact,</B> according to a story in the December issue of <I>Popular Mechanics </I>magazine. Hi-tech methods and archaeological research have helped convince some scientists that Bible stories may be true, the article said. <BR><B>...Scientists now are looking for explanations</B> for the parting of the Red Sea, the star of Bethlehem, Noah's ark, Lot's wife, Lazarus' rising, the plague of locusts, and the burning bush, <I>Popular Mechanics</I> reported. <P> <B>Jordan passed a law requiring all schools to offer a course in Christianity for Christian students</B>. Previously, Christian students were required to take a class in Islam if a course in Christianity was not included in the school curriculum, Nazarene Communications Network News reported. <P> <B>Instead of donating money because they love God,</B> many church-goers are demanding tangible results for what they put in the collection plate, according to a new study. Sylvia and John Ronsvalle, who spent three years speaking to congregants in 500 churches from 19 Christian denominations, described their findings in the book <I>Behind the Stained Glass Windows: Money Dynamics in the Church</I>. The Ronsvalles are founders of  empty tomb inc., a nonprofit research group in Champaign, Ill. <BR><B>...&quot;It's a consumer mentality,&quot;</B> Mrs. Ronsvalle said. The trend started in the 1980s, when churches that faced dwindling congregations used market researchers to learn what would attract people. This started a trend in which people shop for a congregation as if they were looking for a department store bargain. <P> <B>A former Moroccan prime minister was picked </B>to lead a group representing the world's Muslim nations. Azeddine Laraki said he would promote Islam as a peaceful faith opposed to terrorism. Members of the 54-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference represent 1.5 billion people in Africa, Europe and Asia. <BR><B>...Delegates at the group's meeting said they are frustrated</B> that non-Muslims associate Islam with political extremism and terrorism. Laraki plans to sponsor seminars to &quot;give proof that Islam is a religion of peace, of progress, of cooperation.&quot; <P> <B>Pamphlets with graphic depictions of late-term abortions have appeared inside packages of cereal</B>, pretzels, cake mix, and toilet paper purchased at stores in northern New Jersey, The Associated Press reported. Police in Ramsey, N.J., received reports of  anti-abortion pamphlets found in packages at ShopRite supermarket. Identical pamphlets have been found in products purchased at grocery stores in Allendale, Hackensack, Paramus, and Hillsdale. <P> <B>Menorahs sprouted up in a Pennsylvania town after an act of vandalism</B>. Vandals early Sunday morning smashed the living room window of  Judith and Martin Markovitz in Newtown Township to destroy an electric menorah lighted in celebration of Hanukkah, <I>The New York Times</I> reported.  <BR><B>...Word about the incident spread quickly</B> through the quiet neighborhood, located northeast of Philadelphia. By nightfall, 18 homes nearby were lighted with electric menorahs. More families said they would have put them in their windows if local stores had not run out of them. Non-Jewish neighbors said they wanted to make sure the Markovitz family knew they had their support.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 9, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>In a step toward overcoming years of  hostility, Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant churches in the former Soviet Union agreed</B> to establish a committee that will promote cooperation and understanding among themselves. The action was taken at a conference in Minsk, Belarus, by delegates from 21 churches and Christian organizations, including Orthodox, Roman Catholics, Baptists, Old Believers (Old Ritualists), Lutherans, and Seventh-day Adventists, Ecumenical News International said. <BR><B>...The Russian Orthodox Church has condemned proselytizing</B> by foreign Protestant missionaries who arrived in the former Soviet Union after the political changes of the late 1980s. A final document at the Minsk conference condemned conversions from one church to another through ways &quot;contradicting the spirit of Christian love and violating the freedom of a human person.&quot; <P> <B>A United Methodist clergyman who has been ordained as a Catholic priest wants to remain part of both churches</B>. W. Paul Jones describes himself as having a &quot;Protestant mind and a Catholic heart,&quot; and says he feels called to bring both churches &quot;the neglected wealth preserved by the other,&quot; United Methodist News Service said. &quot;May my intent to live faithfully in both of these traditions be a small ecumenical step toward the day when we shall affirm that we truly are one in Christ,&quot; Jones said . A decision on his status as a UMC elder is expected to be made late this month. <BR><B>...&quot;Something deep happened within me, a coming home&quot; during a visit to a Trappist monastery</B> in 1972, Jones said. He described the experience as Wesleyan spirituality that the UMC has lost. For three years, Jones spent six months each year teaching theology at UMC-related Saint Paul School of Theology in Kansas City and six months living in a Trappist monastery. <P> <B>Hot-dog evangelism is working in Utica, N.Y.</B>  Foursquare Church member Mark Bolo opened a mobile  stand on a busy street and began giving away hot dogs, drinks, and Christian tracks to passers-by, Discipling A Whole Nation said. <BR><B>...He saw results quickly</B>. One man said he didn't know what he could feed his two daughters. Although he did not often pray, he sat in his car and quietly said, &quot;God, what can I do?&quot; At the next light, the man came across Bolo. In another instance, a bar owner asked Bolo to set up his stand in front of his business, then opened his games room and dance floor for Christian concerts.  <BR><B>...About 40 people have shown an interest in becoming Christians as a result of the stand</B>, Bolo said. Because someone &quot;gave the people something instead of talking, hearts were opened,&quot; he said. <P> <B>Christian conservatives are irked that the presidential candidates are downplaying issues such as abortion,</B> homosexual rights, and attacks on religious liberty. Conservatives are likely to feel disenfranchised by both parties if such issues are avoided, as they were in the Oct. 6 presidential debate, said Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council. If the issues are not raised in the next debate, &quot;Bill Clinton is going to be re-elected,&quot; he said.  <BR><B>...Pat Robertson said he is anticipating &quot;a blowout this November&quot;</B> for Clinton, news reports said. Robertson made the comment Monday during the <I>700 Club</I> program. <P> <B>Lawyers for John G. Bennett, Jr., will argue in court that Bennett was insane while he ran the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy</B>, Religion News Service reported. Bennett was indicted Sept. 27 on 82 counts of defrauding charities, including a number of  evangelical Christian groups. Prosecutors say New Era ran a ponzi scheme that was the biggest charity fraud in U.S. history.  Bennett has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire, mail, and bank fraud. <P> <B>Americans who gave money to charities last year contributed an average of 10% more than in 1993</B>, a Gallup Organization study found. But more households gave nothing, according to the study. <BR><B>...The average contribution per household was $1,017. </B> Some 69% said their households gave to charity last year, down from 73% who gave in 1993 and the lowest rate in eight years. <BR><B>...An increasing number of  Americans distrust the way charities use their money.</B> The percentage who disagreed with the statement &quot;most charitable organizations are honest and ethical in their use of funds&quot; has increased from 20% in 1990 to 31% this year. <P> <B>Evan Carl Hunziker, the American arrested in North Korea and accused  of spying</B>, was &quot;only trying to preach the Gospel&quot; after converting to Christianity last year, his father said. Hunziker, 26, got into alcohol, drugs and trouble with the law, but sobered up and converted to Christianity during a 90-day jail term for drunken driving in Alaska, said Edwin Hunziker of Parkland, Wash. He said his son went to Korea in August intending to get a job and preach Christianity. <BR><B>...Evan &quot;doesn't know the first thing about spying, unless somebody in South Korea educated him</B> right quick in a month,&quot; Hunziker said. Evan's mother said her son was divorced from a South Korean woman three years ago, speaks Korean well, and intended to become a missionary, <I>The Seattle Times</I> said. <BR><B>...North Korean diplomats said Hunziker is being charged with illegal entry and espionage</B>, which could result in a death sentence. An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hunziker had not worked for the U.S. government as a spy or in any other capacity. <P> <B>Some 250 middle- and high school students marched out of classes</B> in Elizabethtown, N.J., Tuesday. They were protesting their school's resolution that says &quot;pro-homosexual concepts on sex and family will never be tolerated or accepted in this school.&quot; The students also objected to the resolution's description of the two-parent family as &quot;the norm,&quot; news reports said. Some of the students carried signs, and more than a dozen parents attended the demonstration in support. <P> <B>Large parts of Britain probably won't have enough full-time Church of  England parish priests by the end of the century.</B>  According to a report, a recruitment crisis in the church forecasts that by 2001 the number of  full-time male clergy will have fallen by 1,175 to 8,007, <I>The London Times</I> said. There will be about 9,000 full-time men and women priests in the Church by the turn of the century, leaving at least 4,000 parishes without a minister.     </font></p>

In September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said RU-486 is safe and effective when used under a doctor's supervision. But the FDA withheld final approval of the drug until it receives more information about how it would be manufactured and labeled. If approved, RU-486 could become available at hospital clinics and doctors' offices across America next summer. <BR><B>...About 2,000 women around the United States are being enrolled in the trials, reports said. </B>RU-486 has been used by 200,000 European women since 1988. Potential side effects include uterine bleeding, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. <P> <B>The U.S. Justice Department is continuing to review possible violations of law by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan</B>, <I>The Washington Times</I> reported. Farrakhan has made two trips to Libya, which is under U.S. embargoes for supporting  terrorism. Farrakhan was given a $1 billion gift for the Nation of Islam and a $250,000 human rights award, but has not yet accepted them because of a U.S. Treasury Department ban, which he said he would challenge in U.S. courts. Farrakhan also has visited Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and Sudan, which are alleged to be sponsors of international terrorism. <BR><B>...Reno declined to comment on Farrakhan's recent public remark</B> calling the United States the &quot;great Satan&quot; and predicting the fall of the country. <P> <B>A group of  Muslims and Christians are trying to mend relations after last week's rioting in East Java,</B> news reports said. The religious leaders pledged to clean up and rebuild churches burned and damaged during rioting in Situbondo. Abdurrahman Wahid, chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, said he would lead the effort. Situbondo authorities said Protestants and Catholics could use a government building for their services. <P> <B>A ministry to youths who write graffiti may have to end</B>. Noel Buchanan has spent eight years on Melbourne, Australia, trains as a Christian missionary among hardcore graffiti writers, reports said. His ministry, called Godspeek Ulturnativart, addresses social and spiritual problems of youth who damage other people's property. Many graffiti writers come from suburbs and attend private schools, said Buchanan, who has spoken to numerous school and community groups. The Christian church has expressed concern for youth, but has not given practical support to his ministry, Buchanan said. <P> <B>Sweet Haven Holy Church of God  in Carrollton, Va., gives money back to parishioners, </B>the Associated Press said. After services, Bishop Nathaniel Johnson passes out play money. Those who find Johnson's initials on the back win $10-$100. To be eligible, winners must be present for the two-hour service. Johnson said some people come for the money, but notes that attendance has doubled to about 100 people since the giveaway started three years ago. <P> <B>A Satanic cult is being blamed for the burning of a church in Belarus on Sunday</B>. Orthodox Church Patriarch Filaret said writing on the walls of the Zaslavl church proclaimed &quot;Death to Christians,&quot; the Associated Press said. Last summer, slogans praising Satan were painted on walls of the Orthodox cathedral in Minsk. <P> <B>Dolores Street Baptist Church in San Francisco said it will distribute marijuana to ease the pain </B>of people suffering from AIDS, cancer, and other illnesses, Associated Baptist Press said. The former Southern Baptist congregation is one of two San Francisco churches offering the drug. Pastor Doug Donley said the church believes that &quot;God's law of healing is more important than state laws banning the use of marijuana as medicine.&quot; A church statement said restricting marijuana's medicinal use &quot;is to deny Christ's call to offer healing to all of God's people in need.&quot; The church left the Southern Baptist Convention in 1993 to protest the denomination's expulsion of two churches over homosexuality.  <P> <B>A new limestone cross and steeple were lifted into place Sunday at an Oklahoma City, Okla., cathedral</B> damaged by the 1995 bombing at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral is located two blocks away from the blast. The bomb tore away a third of the church's cross, broke stained glass windows, and pushed brick walls several inches. The congregation worships next door, but  hopes to be back in the sanctuary by Easter and have the cathedral fully restored by Christmas 1998. <P> <B>A veneer of acrylic paint will no longer be considered clothing for revelers at this year's raunchy Fantasy Fest</B> in Key West, Fla. Police, who expect 50,000 people to attend the annual event, also say they will confine public drinking to a 10-block &quot;fantasy zone.&quot;  <BR><B>...This year's bizarre festival began Oct. 18 with nine days of costumes and parties, </B>and ends in a parade on the Saturday before Halloween. Conservative Christians oppose the festival, which began in 1979, in part because it has been known as a homosexual event featuring public nudity. <BR><B>...The Monroe County Christian Coalition also is opposing </B>Fantasy Fest, calling it a week of &quot;depravity and debauchery,&quot; news reports said. Key West officials are trying to calm the revelry without alienating tourists, reports said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for February 4, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>About 4,000 people attended the 54th annual National Religious Broadcasters convention, </B>held Jan. 25-28 in Anaheim, Calif.  Speakers included Wellington Boone, John MacArthur, Jr., Max Lucado, and David Jeremiah, Franklin Graham, Beverly LaHaye, and Moody Bible Institute President Joseph Stowell III.  Some 200 booths held displays about television and radio stations, research and advertising agencies, book and music publishers, computer networks, and technology companies.  The convention also included 40 educational sessions.     <BR><B>...Jim Bakker was on hand for the convention.  </B>The former Assembly of God minister, who had spent five years in prison, autographed copies of his book <I>I Was Wrong</I> (Thomas Nelson Publishers).  Royalties will go to Bakker's lawyers and the Internal Revenue Service, to which he owes more than $1 million, Associated Baptist Press reported.    <P> <B>Evangelicals are attempting to stop a wave of suicides in Nicaragua</B>.  An increasing number of Nicaraguans has committed suicide.  Pastors and psychologists are offering telephone advice to desperate people.  Several young people who became suicidal after failed love affairs already have been saved by the program, according to the Latin American and Caribbean Communication Agency.  Suicide attempts also are being blamed on poverty, lack of hope in the political system, and society's decline in moral values.  Christian radio stations are supporting the campaign. <P> <B>A gunman killed Roman Catholic Bishop Benjamin de Jesus</B> in front of his cathedral on Jolo island, the Philippines, Tuesday.  The attack is the latest religious violence in the southern Philippines between Muslims and Catholics.  In Manila, Monsignor Pedro Quitorio called on Catholics not to be provoked into reprisals.  A rebel group reached a peace agreement with the government last year, but radical guerrillas demanding an Islamic state still operate in the area. <P> <B>A Norwegian clergyman wants airplanes grounded during funerals </B>held in churches along the flight path of Oslo's new airport, the newspaper<I> Aftenposten </I>reported.  Bishop Even Fougner said it would be hard for the seven churches to hold dignified ceremonies with jetliners roaring overhead.  A national aviation official said complying with the request would be difficult since flights were so frequent. <P> <B>A Nigerian businessman admitted receiving stolen goods,</B> and handed back spare parts worth thousands of dollars to Nigeria Airways after converting to Christianity, the <I>National Concord</I> newspaper reported.  The airline agreed not to prosecute the repentant man, who said he bought the items from thieves before he became a born-again Christian. <P> <B>A Garland, Texas, ministry is helping middle-school children keep from joining gangs that steal cars and sell drugs</B>.  Youngsters with time on their hands come to the Powerhouse Club center for recreation and snacks after school.  Volunteers from local churches befriend them, providing adult role models.  Police say Garland has 76 juvenile gangs with thousands of members, Associated Baptist Press said. <P> <B>Two swindlers who conned a church congregation out of money</B> have been jailed, the <I>London Times</I> reported.  The two spent seven months convincing the Elim Pentecostal Church in Coventry that the older of them, Paul Redhead, suffered from brain damage -- until he staged a miraculous cure during a service.  The congregation had donated money to the men, but the fraud was discovered when a minister took Redhead to a doctor in order to verify the healing.   <P> <B>The former host of a Mormon Church radio program</B> who spoke against child abuse and pornography has been sentenced to one to 15 years in prison for sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl.  Lloyd Gerald Pond pleaded guilty in November to felony forcible sexual abuse, a charge reduced from forcible sodomy.  The victim told police that Pond, 51, a church acquaintance, paid her for phone sex, photographed her in revealing clothing, then tricked her into performing a sex act.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 18, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...Some residents of Anne Arundel County, Md., near Washington, D.C</B>., recently urged county officials to stop Riverdale Baptist Church from constructing a 1,500-seat church with parking for 700 cars on a 2.5 acre site. The president of the local civic association told <I>The Post</I> that a lot of residents &quot;feel the church is just too enormous.&quot; <P> <B>A 16-year-old Walpole, N.H., boy cycled 1,000 miles to raise money for churches burned by arsonists</B> and to help his youth group. Steffan Legasse, a member of St. John's Episcopal Church, pedaled to Georgia, where he met people whose churches had burned. &quot;I wanted to do something to help,&quot; he said. <BR><B>...Legasse, whose father runs a public relations firm in nearby Keene, N.H., created a press kit</B> detailing his motivations for making the bike trek. It included copies of press reports and photos taken during his journey. The high school junior also constructed a <A HREF= http://www.legasse.com/bikehikes/update.html>site on the Internet</A> offering updates on his trip, a letter outlining his goals, and a pledge form. A list of personal and corporate sponsors, information about news reports on his bike trip, and a Quicktime movie of  his trek also are planned. His goal is to raise $10,000 and split it between his youth group and the churches. <P> <B>A mission for the poor in Biloxi, Miss., run by the United Church of Christ,  lost a two-year property battle with a gambling casino</B>. After 74 years of ministry, Back Bay Mission must close, making way for a $120-million casino on what used to be the mission's property, the denomination said. <BR><B>...Back Bay's fight to keep its property involved the purpose and definition of &quot;church.&quot;</B> The mission argued that a church is defined by the actions people of faith take, but a court ruled that a church is a building where people worship each Sunday, the UCC said. In December 1995, Biloxi seized some of Back Bay's land under eminent domain, demolishing four buildings and part of a church building to make way for wider roads to accommodate casino traffic. Back Bay dropped its appeal this August, agreeing to sell the land. The mission sold its land to a Nevada company for $2.2 million and will move about 10 blocks from its current site.  <P> <B>Campus Crusade for Christ will dedicate its new, 285-acre, $48 million home</B> Saturday in Orlando, Fla. The property will be headquarters for the World Center for Discipleship and Evangelism of Campus Crusade, the nation's largest ministry. Ground is to be broken soon and the center could be open by 1998, the ministry said.  <P> <B>The United Church of Christ plans to build a 7-story, 93-room hotel in downtown Cleveland, Ohio</B>. The UCC, whose church offices are in Cleveland, said it considers the hotel a means of reducing costs for church-related meetings. The hotel also will produce income for the denomination. The UCC will use funds currently invested elsewhere to build the hotel. <P> <B>The Christian Coalition began distributing $750,000 to rebuild churches burned by arsonists</B>. The money has come from hundreds of predominantly white evangelical congregations. Coalition leader Ralph Reed said the Virginia Beach, Va.-based group will hold a gathering of pastors and community activists to discuss rebuilding black communities by strengthening their churches. Participants at the Congress on Racial Recovery, planned for April, will issue a document that will contain &quot;a new civil rights agenda,&quot; Reed said. <BR><B>...The National Council of Churches, which is working with the U.S. Catholic Conference</B>, several Jewish groups, and others, has raised $9.5 million in cash, pledges, and donations of materials. It also has begun distributing the money. <P> <B>An estimated 12,000 people from across the United States came to a farm in Conyers, Ga., Oct. 13</B> to hear what they believe is a message from the Virgin Mary. Nancy Fowler delivers the messages annually on Oct. 13, when Mary appears before her in a room, she says. This year, Mary said people must amend their ways because they offend God, Fowler said. <P> <B>A drunken driver was convicted of manslaughter for killing a baby born prematurely</B> after the man crashed into the baby's mother's car. Frank Flores Cuellar was convicted Oct. 17 in Corpus Christi, Texas, in the death of Krystal Zuniga. The girl was born with brain damage a month and a half premature and died two days later. It is one of the first cases in Texas to test whether someone can be held criminally liable for harming an unborn child. <P> <B>Evidence pointing to the fact that prayer has a positive effect on healing is impressing an increasing number of physicians</B>, according to Dr. Larry Dossey, an author and former chief of staff at a Dallas hospital. Dossey's new book,<I> Prayer Is Good Medicine </I>(HarperSanFrancisco), explores common questions about prayer's healing benefits. <BR><B>...Recent studies underscore prayer's benefits in healing and illustrate faith's positive impact on life</B>, Dossey told <I>USA Today</I>. A study reported by the National Institute for Health Care Research showed that faith is important for a happy life among senior citizens. <P> <B>The Clinton-Gore campaign revised an advertisement airing on Christian stations</B> in response to pressure from homosexual-rights groups, Religion News Service said. The 60-second spot, airing on 70 stations, praised Clinton for signing the Defense of Marriage Act. The President &quot;has fought for our values,&quot; the original ad said. RNS said the ad offended the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Human Rights Campaign, and ACT-UP, who asked for it to be removed.    </font></p>
